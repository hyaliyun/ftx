The ceramics from the Leopard's Kopje type site have been classified as part of phase II of the Leopard's Kopje culture. For information on the region of Leopard's Kopje, see the \\"Associated sites\\" section of this article.  Location  The site is located 2 kilometers north-east of the Khami World Heritage Site and 24 kilometers west of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Bordered by small hills, or koppies, on two sides and sharp ravines on the other two sides. The site is relatively small, measuring 150 by 200 yards in area.  History  K. R. Robinson conducted several excavations in the area, beginning in 1961. Thomas Huffman, who first excavated Leopard's Kopje in August 1969, is also an important archaeologist of the site. Huffman's excavations found three different phases of occupation, Zhizo, Mambo, and Refuge. = Refuge phase = The occupation from the 18/19th centuries is called the Refuge phase. Because it was the latest phase of occupation at the Leopard's Kopje site, its stratigraphy is closest to the surface and was therefore excavated first. Below a thin humus layer was a large ashy layer, in which artifacts such as zebra teeth, freshwater mussel shells, and turtle shells were found. Pottery sherds were found in middens and among stone structures. At least one known burial was found at this level. = Mambo phase = In the original excavation by Huffman, several structures were found at the Mambo phase level, dating to the 10/11th centuries. Artifacts such as figurines and cattle teeth were discovered in multiple trenches. Evidence of an infant burial was also found. Several hut floors and plastered courtyards were uncovered, giving archaeologists a sense of the layout of the settlement. = Zhizo phase = The stratigraphy shows that the earliest settlement is from the 9th century AD, now called the Zhizo phase. Possible traces of manure indicate that people kept goats or sheep. Along with large amounts of Zhizo pottery, artifacts such as glass and shell beads, copper bangles, daga rubble, and iron slag were excavated by Huffman and his team. \\"Zhizo\\" is also a term used for the cultural phase that preceded the Leopard's Kopje cultural phase.  Archaeological characteristics  = Cattle = There is strong archaeological evidence that people at Leopard's Kopje kept cattle. Vitrified and angular blocks of dung mark the perimeters of ancient cattle byres. These kraals were located at the center of villages, rather than to the edge of a settlement, meaning cattle would have been a central and important part of daily life. Huffman discovered a large white zone in the stratigraphy of the Mambo phase level that is believed to be cattle manure. Cattle teeth have also been excavated. The introduction of larger cattle herds at Leopard's Kopje around the 10th century are seen as evidence of increased cultural complexity. This is thought to have resulted from a developing gold trade. Finger millet, one of the grains consumed by the people of Leopard's Kopje. = Diet = Archaeobotanical evidence offers insight into the diet of the occupants at Leopard's Kopje. In 1969, Huffman and his team found seeds from finger millet, ground beans, sorghum, cowpeas, and wild plants at the Mambo phase level. The Leopard's Kopje diet would also have consisted of the livestock they kept, including cattle, goat, and sheep. = Beads = Huffman's excavations found glass and shell beads at the Zhizo phase level, dating back to the 9th century. Some clay beads were also discovered at the Mambo phase level. Robinson's 1961 excavation found just two glass beads. Both were cylindrical and blue-green in color, typical of phase II of the Leopard's Kopje culture. = Iron smelting = Strong evidence of iron smelting has been found at the Mambo phase level, and bits of iron slag have been found at the Zhizo phase level, suggesting that iron smelting existed at Leopard's Kopje as early as the 9th century. = Pottery = Excavations of Leopard's Kopje have primarily focused on ceramic analysis. The middle Iron Age brought about a shift from communal ownership of pottery to private ownership. Leopard's Kopje ceramic style is known for being multidimensional, with incised and excised bands. Shallow bowls and plates, jars with triangles, and beakers with high burnished necks are also typical. In Robinson's 1961 excavation alone, 182 pottery fragments were uncovered. The most common vessel found was a shouldered pot with a concave neck and either an incised ladder pattern or a chevron pattern. These motifs were created with incisions or stabs, rather than comb-stamping. Few of the burnished beakers and bowls found were decorated. = Stone buildings = Settlements throughout the larger Leopard's Kopje region feature stone buildings. The prevalence of these stone structures is the inspiration behind the name \\"Zimbabwe,\\" which means \\"houses of stone.\\" Evidence of stone buildings were found by Huffman at the Refuge phase level. The evolution from earthen houses to stone buildings is an indication of social changes, much like the introduction of larger cattle herds.  Associated sites  The area associated with the Leopard‚Äôs Kopje region stretches from just south of Belingwe, Zimbabwe, down to the Limpopo River. Archaeological sites in the region date to between 950-1100 AD. The six type sites that have been selected as most representative of the Leopard's Kopje culture are Zhizo Hill, York Ranch, Leopard's Kopje, Taba Zikamambo, Woolandale Estate Midden Mounds, and Enyandeni Farm. Other notable associated sites include Mapela Hill, K2, Khami, Mapungubwe, and Bambandyanalo.

The 274th provides tactical command and control of air power assets to the Joint Forces Air Component Commander and Joint Forces Land Component Commander for combat operations. Mission The 274 Air Support Operations Squadron trains, equips, and deploys mission qualified Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) members consisting of Air Liaison Officers and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) in support of the 42d Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Unit members are tasked with providing advice, guidance, and planning considerations to United States Army ground commanders on the proper integration of USAF airpower and close air support into the ground scheme of maneuver. As JTACs, 274th members are further qualified to provide terminal guidance and attack execution in a combat environment. In a domestic operations role, the 274th is responsible for establishing communications during state emergency response and contingency operations as ordered by the Governor of New York.  History  = World War II = The 313th Signal Company, Wing was constituted and activated on 1 December 1942 at Camp Pinedale, California and assigned to the Fourth Air Force for training purposes in preparation for reassignment overseas in support of World War II. Upon completion of training, the unit was assigned to Twelfth Air Force and transferred to the Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 12 August 1943 to prepare for transport overseas. On 4 September 1943, the 313th loaded onto the S.S. Santa Elena, a converted luxury cruise liner from the Grace Line, at the New York Port of Embarkation where it departed for North Africa, arriving on 11 September. Upon arrival in North Africa, the 313th was reassigned to the 57th Bombardment Wing which it would remain under throughout the course of the war until inactivation. The 313th departed North Africa for Italy on 26 November 1943, arriving on 29 November. In the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, the unit participated in the Allied Invasion of Italy during the Naples-Foggia Campaign from 18 August 1943 to 21 January 1944 and the Rome-Arno Campaign from 22 January 1944 till the end of the war. The 313th received battle credits and streamers for both campaigns. On 18 April 1944, the unit was transferred from Italy to Corsica. On 15 April 1945, the unit was transferred back to Italy where it would remain throughout the duration of the war. On 4 October 1945 at Camp Marcianise, Italy, the 313th was formally inactivated and control of the unit was transferred to the War Department. = Cold War era = On 24 May 1946, the 313th was allotted to the New York National Guard and redesignated as the 102d Communications Squadron. On 29 March 1948, the unit was consolidated at the White Plains Armory in White Plains, New York and received Federal recognition with the mission to install, maintain, and operate communications facilities for the 52nd Fighter Wing, New York Air National Guard. On 1 July 1952, the unit underwent major manpower and mission changes and was redesignated as the 274th Communications Squadron. The unit‚Äôs new mission was to install, operate, and maintain mobile communications facilities in support of the 253rd Combat Communications Group, Air Force Communications Service, and Tactical Air Command communications area in a national emergency. In July 1959, the 274th was assigned the primary mission to provide highly mobile communications teams in support of contingencies and relocated to Roslyn Air National Guard Station in East Hills, New York. Changing with each Command served, the basic mission of the 274th was to provide, site, install, operate, and maintain deployed tactical communications equipment in support of a Tactical Air Base, providing commanders in the field with record and voice communications back to rear / area command headquarters via long haul radio systems and or in country circuits. Communications were provided via long haul HF/ISB radio and later satellite radio systems. Tactical telephone, record communications, and Command and Control HF/SSB systems were the primary services provided. Local Area Networks (LAN) for computerized supply, personnel and maintenance reporting services were added later. All communications systems were highly complex and all were secured. = 1995 BRAC = In 1995, in order to produce a more efficient and cost- effective basing structure, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended to the Secretary of Defense the closure of Roslyn ANGS and subsequent relocation of the 274th Combat Communications Squadron to Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York. In 1998, rather than being moved to Stewart ANGB, the unit was to be moved to Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse, New York and redesignated as the 274th Air Support Operations Squadron. = Air support operations = On 1 October 1999, the 274th Combat Communications Squadron was redesignated as the 274th Air Support Operations Squadron and relocated to Hancock Field ANGB. The 274 ASOS' new mission was tactical command and control of air assets while embedded with aligned US Army units. Despite the name change and new mission, the history of working with advanced communications equipment since World War II continued.  September 11, 2001  The attacks on New York City on the morning of 11 September 2001 were the first operational test of the 274 ASOS. Within hours of the attacks, half of the unit loaded onto HC-130's from the 106th Rescue Wing for deployment to New York City as part of the initial response; the second half of the unit would follow on 12 September. The rapid notification and deployment ensured that unit members were on the ground and operational in less than 8 hours after the first attack. In New York City, the unit's mission was to serve as a communications platform in the center of the city for the various first responder, aid, and relief units. Unit members drew upon their training and experiences working in austere environments within minimal equipment to effectively and efficiently relay communications between relief workers and local, state, and federal leadership. 274th Close Air Support Squadron airmen during an exercise at Fort Drum  Afghanistan and Iraq  In anticipation of deployment operations as a result of the September 11th attacks, the 274th increased their training tempo and operational readiness, conducting close air support training throughout the winter in locations across the United States. The increased effort put towards JTAC training, readiness, and currency resulted in the unit being given initial operational capability (IOC) status in December 2002, paving the way for unit members to contribute to the operations in Afghanistan and to prepare for the expected operations in Iraq.  Domestic operations  As part of the domestic response role, the unit was activated several times for relief efforts, most recently for the flooding in Binghamton, New York caused by Tropical Storm Lee in September 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in New York City and the relief efforts in Buffalo, New York due to severe lake effect snowfall received in November 2014.

However, since the mid-1990s, income, gender and social inequality in Germany has been rising. History Many of the inequalities that Germany is experiencing today can be traced back to the reunification of East and West Germany. It was during this time that Eastern German manufacturing and social constructs lagged behind that of the west. East German policies mainly reflected that of a communist nation since they were being funded and governed by a communist Russian regime. As a result of these policies and regulatory practices, manufacturing in the east struggled during reunification, contributing to the current geographical divide. The gap in manufacturing technology between East and West Germany led to the demise of many East German businesses, leaving many eastern Germans unemployed or significantly underemployed. Income and wealth inequality Since the 1980s, income inequality in Germany has been rising. According to the German think- tank DIW, a typical citizen in the upper 1% of earnings in Germany holds a personal wealth of at least 800,000 euros ($1.09 million), whilst over 25% of all adults have either no wealth or negative wealth due to debt. Germany's Gini coefficient was 0.78 in 2012, compared with 0.68 in France, 0.61 in Italy and 0.45 in Slovakia. A geographical inequality has also been found between the areas of Germany previously known as East Germany and West Germany; on average, an adult in former West Germany has assets worth 94,000 Euros, as compared to a typical adult in the former communist East Germany with just over 40,000 Euros. Gender inequality Police wear protective riot gear during anti-Nazi demonstration According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, average gross hourly earnings for women in 2008 were 23.2 percent lower than that of their male counterparts. The average employed female employee in Germany earns 23.1% less than the average male employee, in comparison to 16.4% across the EU. There is also gender division between some industries, with most men in Germany employed in the manufacturing industry whilst most women are employed in health and social work.

Stodel has represented Great Britain at three Summer Paralympics and with her colleagues John Robertson and Stephen Thomas has won multiple medals in the Mixed Sonar class at the Disabled Sailing World Championships, including gold in 2005 and 2006. Personal life Stodel was born in 1985, growing up in the coastal village of West Mersea, in south-east England. She was born without a lower right arm. Stodel matriculated to Loughborough University where she studied Sport & Exercise Science. Sailing career Stodel was introduced to sailing at the age of three, her first boat being a Mirror. Stodel has stated that due to her disability she was bullied as a child, and she used sailing as an escape from the pain. In 1995 she joined the Royal Yachting Association Mirror National Junior Squad, a predominantly able bodied team, as she felt disability events were a weaker option. Her sailing career path changed after receiving a phone call from Andy Cassell, a British Paralympic sailor. He invited Stodel to a sailing weekend where he argued that disability competitions were not a lesser form of sailing and that by switching from mainstream competitions more opportunities would become available to her. Stodel was won over by Cassell and in 2003 she switched class to sonar competing in disability events. She teamed up with fellow British sailors John Robertson and Stephen Thomas and in 2003 they secured the bronze medal at the IFDS World Disabled Sailing Championship in Athens. The following year the trio qualified for their first Summer Paralympics, finishing sixth in the Sonar class. Stodel, Robertson and Thomas would remain as a team for over 12 years, with major successes coming in the 2005 World Championships in Sonderborg and the 2006 World Championships in Perth where they took gold in their class. They represented Britain in their second Paralympics, in the 2008 Games in Beijing. They again finished sixth. Two silver medals in the 2010 and 2011 IFDS World Championships were followed by their third successive Paralympics, this time on home surf when the games came to London. The London Paralympics ended in disappointment for Stodel and her team mates after they were deducted four points after a team bosun cleaned the port side of their keel after being authorized to inspect the craft for damage. The deduction saw the British team drop to fifth and the bronze medal going to Norway, just three points ahead of them. In the run up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Stodel was part of a third World Championship winning Sonar team, beating the Australian team by a single point.

John Vallancy, vicar of Rosliston took two members of his congregation to court for interrupting the service. The case at Swadlincote Petty Sessions was thrown out by the magistrates. Two years later he appeared in Burton County court in an action against one of his parishioners, as he disagreed with her habit of placing flowers on her sister's grave. He lost the case and was ordered to pay the defendant's costs. On 18 August 1896 he appeared again at Swadlincote Petty Sessions accused of threatening to shoot a visitor by the name of Wright. He was found guilty and fined 20s. This series of offences resulted in him appearing at a Consistory Court in 1897 where he was charged by the Bishop of Southwell under the Clergy Discipline Act of 1892.

Willis moved with her family to Los Angeles when she was eight years old. In 1940, Willis graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in education and a minor in art. Willis studied with studio ceramicist Laura Andreson. Willis used many of the same techniques taught by Andreson including crackle glazes and intense colors including turquoise, citron and a deep Chinese red. In the 1940s, Willis began making ceramics after husband joined the United States Army Air Corps, signing her works \\"Barbara Willis.\\" Willis was also known as Barbara Willis Abbott. In 1941, Willis partnered with Jean Rose setting up a studio in Rose's residence. The new venture was named Barbara-Jean Pottery Studio.

Willis produced streamlined art ware which included vases, platter, bowls, figurines, ashtrays, and kitchen ware. Some of her work was decorated with decals. In 1958, her ceramics studio closed. Willis estimated she produced more than 250,000 pieces prior to closing her studio.

The site uses an application programming interface (API) to the Steam software distribution service that is owned by Valve to estimate the number of sales of software titles offered on the service. Estimates are made based on the API polling user profiles from Steam to determine what software titles (primarily video games) they own and using statistics to estimate overall sales. Software developers have reported that Galyonkin's algorithms can provide sales numbers that are accurate to within 10%, though Galyonkin cautions against using his estimates in financial projections and other business-critical decisions. Due to changes in Steam's privacy features in April 2018, Galyonkin had anticipated he would need to shut down the service due to the inability to estimate accurate numbers from other sources, but later that month revealed a new algorithm using publicly available data, which, while having a larger number of outliers, he still believes has reasonable accuracy for use. Concept and history Tracking of video game sales is of strong interest to the video game industry, but does not have the robustness of other industries, such as television with the Nielsen ratings system or music with Billboard charts. Though the NPD Group does track retail and digital sales of video games, access to this data requires payment and it does not typically break down distribution of sales on various platforms. Sites like VGChartz have attempted to collect more detailed sales figures based on external data, but there have been reported problems with how this data is aggregated. Valve's Steam client is the largest outlet for digital sales of games for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. Normally, sales of video games and other software offered by Steam are kept confidential between Valve and the publishers and developers of the titles; developers and publishers are free to offer these numbers to the public if they desired. Valve does offer statistics on the most bought and played games, but otherwise does not provide any sales figures publicly. Galyonkin noted that whereas the film industry receives funding from financing companies which are more open about sharing their financial results, funding within the video game comes from a variety of non- traditional sources, leading to the market being coy to report on the sales of a game. The idea for Steam Spy originally came from a similar approach used by Kyle Orland and the website Ars Technica for their \\"Steam Gauge\\" feature starting in April 2014. Steam Gauge uses the Steam API to access publicly available user profiles to obtain a list of games that that user owns. At the time of its creation there were over 170 million Steam accounts, making the task of polling the entire list of games impractical. Instead, they opted to poll between 80,000 and 90,000 each day as to collect the game lists, and then used sampling statistics to estimate the total ownership of each game. Ars Technica estimated at its onset that the margin of error was within 0.33%. The site's founder, Sergey Galyonkin Galyonkin was inspired by Steam Gauge to create Steam Spy. At the time, Galyonkin was a Senior Analyst at Wargaming. Steam Spy uses the same approach of sampling a small percentage of Steam accounts, approximately 100,000 to 150,000 per day with a rolling sampling approach. The collected data is processed nightly to create visualizations used on the site, and thus offers historical trends for games as well. As with Steam Gauge, Galyonkin notes that Steam Spy is subject to similar sampling errors, so that data for newly released games or for games with low sales will not likely have accurate estimates of numbers. The polling approach is also prone to promotions that Valve runs, such as when a game is offered for free over a weekend; during this time, the game will appear owned on every Steam profile, and will artificially bump up the sales numbers. Galyonkin's method also polls the amount of time that each profile has played a particular game, allowing him to collect estimated playtime statistics on a per-game basis. As of September 2016, Galyonkin continues to operate the site and has plans for several major features, alongside his current position as Head of Publishing for Eastern Europe for Epic Games. However, in April 2018, Valve announced a change to Steam's privacy policies, giving users the ability to hide games, friend lists, and other elements of their provide as a means to aid in user privacy. Galyonkin announced that with this change, specifically in that the default settings for all users would hide these profile elements, he would be unable to collect the necessary data needed to run Steam Spy, and plans to shut down the service. Galyonkin has available other data sources to pull estimates from, but he did not feel that they provide the same type of accuracy that he felt his approach with Steam Spy could meet; while he will use these sources for personal research as well as for his role at Epic Games, he does not plan to publish the results in depth. Galyonkin plans to maintain the archives of Steam Spy indefinitely. The change in Steam's privacy settings came around the time of heightened awareness of personal data security, including the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal and the pending enforcement of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and brought Steam's privacy settings inline with those offered by game console services. While journalists and game developers believed that the changes in Steam were for the best, they feared that the closure of Steam Spy would have a significant impact on independent game developers, who had used the service to gauge potential market and sales projections. Later in April 2018, Galyonkin reported that he had returned to some earlier algorithms he had developed which used other publicly available data to serve as a possible replacement. He tested the algorithm on 70 games with most estimates he calculated coming within 10% of known sales figures, but he also observed there were more outliers, making this algorithm less accurate than his previous one, but still sufficient for market research purposes. Golyonkin plans to refine this algorithm and use it to continue operating Steam Spy. In December 2018, Epic Games announced their plans to start a similar storefront as Steam, the Epic Games Store. Galyonkin stated shortly after the announcement that he had been working with Epic for some years to help them develop the store, using the information and analysis he gained in running Steam Spy to help establish some of the features and policies that the Epic Games Store will use, such as providing developers with as much sales data they reasonably can. Galyonkin will still continue to operate Steam Spy. Impact Galyonkin says that his estimates of sales have been confirmed as close with several developers. Gamasutra says that developers that they have spoken to also agree that the numbers from Steam Spy are \\"in the right ballpark\\". Several developers speaking to PCGamesN stated that Steam Spy is accurate to within 10% of actual sales figures for games with more than a few thousand sales, while the accuracy drops for low-selling titles; Galyonkin himself says data for games under 30,000 sales should be considered suspect. Dave Gilbert of Wadjet Eye Games noted that developers should take caution towards using Steam Spy's data for financial projections as the analysis does not factor in the cost of the game when purchased or obtained, as it can fluctuate due to sales, gifts, developer promotions, and other situations. An undisclosed video game publisher, speaking to Gamasutra, praised Steam Spy as a go-to tool used frequently in their industry to track trends, stating that \\"each game of ours tracks, broadly speaking, within its stated margin of error\\". Galyonkin does warn of the accuracy of Steam Spy data, equating it to the accuracy of political surveys but believes it is sufficiently accurate for general analysis of trends and broad distributions. The forementioned undisclosed publisher noted that Steam Spy data should never be used in isolation to make critical development or publishing decisions. Prior to August 2016, Galyonkin honored all requests from developers and publishers to remove games from his tracking system; examples include Kerbal Space Program and all games published by Paradox Interactive. When Paradox had requested the removal in June 2016, Paradox's Shams Jorjani noted that they had seen \\"flawed\\" business plans from developers seeking their publisher support based solely on ownership data published by Steam Spy, prompting their request. However, in August 2016, Galyonkin reversed this choice, retroactively reincluding the stats from games previously removed. Galyonkin opted for this when Techland requested him to remove their games from the site, prompting him to reassert that his site was meant to be a polling tool for game developers and not capture accurate sales data, and that \\"removing several important independent games from the service will hurt everyone else while not necessarily benefitting the publishers of the removed games\\". Galyonkin noted there was no legal requirement for him to hide this otherwise-public and non- confidential data, and felt no developer was harmed for revealing this information. One developer from a Latin American company did tell Gamasutra that they were concerned about Steam Spy's reporting of the high sales from their game, as it would potentially lead for their offices to become a target for theft in their region. Steam Spy has been used to help quantify certain trends in video game buying behaviors by both Galyonkin and other sources. For example, when Valve introduced the ability to allow buyers to request a refund for any game within certain time constraints in mid-2015, Galyonkin observed that most games received a small increase in sales, proposing that the refund policy enabled users to be more open to try games. Galyonkin also observed that games using the Steam Early access program typically had their largest sales at the point of release for Early Access as opposed to on their completed release. Galyonkin's data also shows that, based on a two-week period in August 2015, that Steam users spend the most time playing games published by Valve, specifically Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Team Fortress 2. Galyonkin is able to track the number of concurrent players for a game over time, allowing him to determine a \\"Hype Factor\\" and \\"Surprise Factor\\" for games based on how much their player base shrunk or grew, respectively, after release, and correlate that to sales estimates. In June 2018, Valve has said they are also looking to provide tools similar to Steam Spy to be provided directly by APIs to others but with more accurate reporting as to make it better than Steam Spy.

He was also part of Satyagraha movement, the Osmania University Student Vandemataram movement, Arya Samaj, State Congress, Andhra Mahasabha(Telangana) and Anti-Razakar movements. Kaloji took part in Andhra Maha Sabha activities since its formation in 1934. He was also associated with the Arya Samaj. He actively participated in the freedom movement of the erstwhile Hyderabad State and underwent imprisonment under the Nizam. He has also participated in various social, political and literary activities in Andhra Pradesh. His active involvement with the masses and their problems and his tireless struggle for their emancipation have naturally earned him in equal measure the love of the people and the wrath of the powers that be. He is one of those select freedom fighters of our country who were imprisoned by the feudal lords and the alien rulers before the attainment of Indian Independence and also by the native leaders thereafter. He has consistently fought for the democratic and responsible government. His commitment to human rights made him an active member of the Tarkunde Committee. Although opposed to power and the trapping of office Kaloji looked upon elections as a democratic exercise. He ran for public office three times and was elected once as a member of the legislative council. His most significant contest was in 1977 against Vengal Rao then Chief Minister who symbolised the 'emergency' rule in Andhra Pradesh.

It takes the form of a violin head, with the neck extending from the head of the lake and is about in diameter. The bay is divided between Quebec in Canada and Vermont in the United States. The main town on its banks is Venise-en-Qu√©bec, a major summer resort. The river of the same name flows into the bay and the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge is located on the American side.  Toponymy  \\"Map of Lake Champlain from Fort Chambly seen over Fort St Frederic, in New France\\". Cadastral map showing concessions and seigneuries on the lake following the boundary of 1739; indication of the course of water and rapids. This card identifies the Michiscouy Bay and the lordships bordering the bay, including that of Mr de Lusignan. Champlain, first governor of New France, was the first European to visit the region. The name has an Abenaki origin, meaning \\"a lot of waterfowl\\" but other meanings are also thought possible. It appears officially in the eighteenth century in the concession document made on April 6, 1733 to Paul-Louis de Lusignan Dazemard as the \\"Missiskouy Bay\\". The spelling has changed several times. In 1855, when changes to electoral counties of Lower Canada into electoral districts, the Legislature finally adopts the form Missisquoi to designate the county and the region.  Geology  Glaciers grounded in the Bay years ago and then melted there forming the Champlain Sea approximately years ago. The maximum depth of the bay is about 4.75 m and its bottom is made of regional marine deposits. The bay waters drain south into the Champlain Lake and the Richelieu River. Until the late 2000s, the water of the bay was stagnant and the bay was dying. At the opening of the new bridge on the US side, the old road causeway was partly demolished which brought a flow of fresh water from Lake Champlain.  Environment  The bay has a great diversity of fauna and flora, including many species of birds, hence the establishment of a national refuge on the US side. Its beaches are very popular with vacationers in summer and its waters attract various activities, especially personal watercraft, boats, etc. In winter, anglers engage in ice fishing activity.

Davis is a federal lawsuit in the United States regarding the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. After the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide on June 26, 2015, the county clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, Kim Davis, refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple to avoid issuing them to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs. She also refused to allow her deputies to issue the licenses, as they would still bear her title and name. On August 12, 2015, U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning ordered Davis to issue marriage licenses to all couples. He stayed his ruling until August 31, at her request, while she sought a stay pending appeal. A federal appeals court denied the stay, followed by the Supreme Court who also refused to stay the ruling. On September 3, Judge Bunning ordered Davis jailed for contempt of court until she complies with the order. Davis was released on September 8, following her deputy clerks issuing marriage licenses to the plaintiffs during her jailing. On September 14, Davis returned to work, at which point she no longer prevented her clerks from issuing licenses, though she continued to question their validity. The case was dismissed as moot on April 19, 2016.https://www.scribd.com/doc/310025455/Miller-v-Davis Background and District Court On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that a state may not refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Kentucky had previously banned same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment, thus same-sex couples rushed to get married as soon as the decision was handed down. The county clerk of Rowan County, Kim Davis, has refused to issue marriage licenses to any couple, same-sex or opposite- sex, since the decision. On July 1, 2015, two same-sex couples and two opposite-sex couples represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against Kim Davis. The case was assigned to Judge David L. Bunning. Hearings for a preliminary injunction ordering Kim Davis to issue marriage licenses to all couples were held on July 13, and July 20. The plaintiffs contend that Obergefell mandates marriage licenses be issued to all couples across the nation, including in Rowan County. Davis contends that the First Amendment protects her from having to do so, as her religious beliefs forbid her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and thus she stopped issuing them to any couple. On August 12, 2015, Judge Bunning issued a preliminary injunction ordering Kim Davis to issue marriage licenses to any qualified couple. He wrote that Kim Davis would suffer no irreparable harm by having her signature on a marriage license issued to a same-sex couple. On August 17, he refused to stay the ruling pending appeal, but granted a temporary stay until August 31. Davis had refused to issue any marriage licenses in the interim. Appeal Davis immediately appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On August 17, after the district court refused to stay its ruling pending appeal, Davis asked the Sixth Circuit for a stay pending appeal. On August 26, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit consisting of Judges Damon J. Keith, John M. Rogers and Bernice B. Donald denied the stay pending appeal. The panel wrote that she had little to no chance to succeed on appeal on the merits of her case.Rejection of Rowan County clerk's application for stay Davis then turned to the Supreme Court for a stay. On August 31, 2015, the day the temporary two-week stay issued on August 17 expired, after the clerk's office had closed, the U.S. Supreme Court, with no noted dissent, declined to stay the district court's ruling in an unsigned order. This route was the last legal one Davis could seek to maintain her policy of not issuing any marriage licenses. On September 1, 2015, the plaintiffs and other couples tried to get marriage licenses, and were declined again. Davis cited \\"God's authority\\" for her refusal, even though she was in direct defiance of the court's order. The plaintiffs immediately filed a motion to hold Davis in contempt of court. On November 2, Davis' lawyers filed a motion asking the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn four of Bunning's decisions, calling them a \\"rush to judgement\\" that \\"imposed direct pressure and substantial burden on Davis, forcing her to choose between her religious beliefs and forfeiting her essential personal freedom on one hand, or abandoning those beliefs to keep her freedom on the other hand\\". The court denied the motion on November 5. Contempt of court After Davis failed to comply with his order Judge Bunning ordered Davis and her staff into court for a contempt hearing on September 3 in Ashland, Kentucky. At the hearing, Judge Bunning remanded Davis into the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for her failure to comply with his earlier order that she issue marriage licenses. \\"The court cannot condone the willful disobedience of its lawfully issued order,\\" Judge Bunning said. \\"If you give people the opportunity to choose which orders they follow, that's what potentially causes problems.\\" Davis was then transported to the Carter County Detention Center in Grayson. Davis' six deputy clerks were also ordered to the hearing. Five out of six of them agreed to issue licenses after Davis' imprisonment. Nathan Davis, Kim Davis' son, refused, though the judge did not impose any penalties on him as long as he agreed not to interfere with other deputies issuing the licenses. Due to Davis' status as an elected official, it would have been difficult to terminate her despite the contempt ruling. Davis could have been impeached and removed from office by the Kentucky General Assembly, but the General Assembly did not meet again until regular session which started January 2016. Governor Steve Beshear said on July 7, 2015 that he \\"will not be calling a special session on this topic\\", citing the compliance of a majority of clerks to the Supreme Court's decision and the cost to taxpayers. Judge Bunning said he would revisit his decision to hold her in contempt in about a week, since by then her deputies will have issued licenses to same-sex couples in her place. Deputy clerks reopened their office in Morehead and began issuing marriage licenses on September 4. On September 6, 2015, Davis's attorneys filed for an appeal of Judge Bunning's contempt of court ruling to the Sixth Circuit. Release from custody On September 8, 2015, Judge Bunning issued an order lifting the contempt of court finding against Davis and ordering her immediate release from custody. In the order, Bunning barred Davis from interfering or attempting to interfere with her deputies issuing the marriage licenses. The order allowed Bunning to sanction Davis again should he determine that she had interfered or prevented her deputies from issuing marriage licenses. On September 14, Davis returned to work at the Rowan County Clerk's office. She did not stand in the way of her deputy clerks issuing marriage licenses, and claimed she would not in the future. However, she questioned the validity of the licenses issued, as they were not issued with her permission or authority. That same day, Governor Beshear stated the licenses were validly issued and would be recognized as valid by the state. Case mooted On December 22, 2015, newly elected governor Matt Bevin issued an executive order removing all county clerks' names from marriage licenses in Kentucky. The State of Kentucky then filed a motion with the Sixth Circuit asking the court to dismiss Davis' appeal as moot. On April 19, 2016, the Sixth Circuit granted the motion, noting the issue was now moot, and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.

Discovery The holotype of Eusaurosphargis dalsassoi (BES SC 390) is a partial skeleton of a single individual found disarticulated but in close association. BES SC 390 was collected from an oil shale at Cava di Besano of the Besano Formation (Grenzbitumenzone).

Etymology Eusaurosphargis was first described and named by Stefania Nosotti and Olivier Rieppel in 2003 and the type species is Eusaurosphargis dalsassoi. The generic name is derived from Greek eu, meaning \\"true/well\\", sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\", and sphargis, the old genus name for the leatherback turtle, in reference to the many similarities Eusaurosphargis shares with Saurosphargis, a taxon whose holotype was lost and was thus considered a mystery. Like the name of Saurosphargis itself, it also refers to Eusaurosphargis' seemingly transitional traits between turtles and other reptiles. The specific name dalsassoi honors the paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso at the Milan Natural History Museum who was the first to realize the importance of BES SC 390. Phylogeny Eusaurosphargis was first included in a phylogenetic analysis in its original description. Nosotti and Rieppel (2003) recovered it as the sister taxon of Helveticosaurus, and based on the description in the literature available for Saurosphargis (whose holotype is lost), they considered it to fall in the same clade. This group was found to be the sister-group of the clade that comprises thalattosauriforms and sauropterygians. The anatomy of Saurosphargis was finally clarified by comparisons with the well-preserved specimens of Sinosaurosphargis, and as a result Saurosphargis was no longer considered to be a nomen dubium, and thus could be included in a phylogenetic analysis. Li et al. (2011) found Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis to form a clade separate from that of Eusaurosphargis and Helveticosaurus, which they termed Saurosphargidae. The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of Li et al. (2014), which includes Eusaurosphargis, Helveticosaurus and all known saurosphargid species. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown.

Brady McCarthy had been the child's nanny for the previous six months, and had been unlawfully in the United States since 2002, living in the Boston area. Her case and subsequent trial received international attention, and similarities were drawn with the case of Louise Woodward, a 19-year-old British nanny who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after an eight-month-old child in her care died from a fractured skull and subdural hematoma in 1997. The charges against Brady McCarthy were dropped two years later, after it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the child was murdered. The incident  On the afternoon of 14 January 2013, police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, responded to an emergency call reporting an unresponsive child. The baby was found breathing but unconscious, and was transported to Boston Children's Hospital and diagnosed with subdural and retinal hemorrhaging and cerebral swelling. The child was pronounced brain dead on 16 January, her first birthday. Accusation and proceedings Brady McCarthy was charged with assault and battery, and then also charged with first-degree murder. Several aspects of the charges against Brady McCarthy led to calls for a further review of the evidence. It was revealed that the prosecution had withheld potentially important evidence in the case, and there was a call for additional study by the medical examiner. A eye specialist consulted by the prosecution had indicated that rather than being the result of blunt force trauma, the child's symptoms could have been the result of an immune disorder known as Job's syndrome. The child had a history of often being sick, and had pre-existing bone fractures in her spine dating from a time several weeks before her death when she had been taken on a family vacation and had not been in the care of the nanny. In April 2015, the medical examiner rescinded the prior conclusion that the child's death had been a homicide caused by violent shaking, saying that \\"the overall state of Rehma's health and her past medical issues raise the possibility that she had some type of disorder that was not able to be completely diagnosed prior to her death\\", noting that the child had a history of bruising, thus raising \\"the possibility that the bleeding could have been related to an accidental injury in a child with a bleeding risk or possibly could have even been a result of an undefined natural disease\\". On 1 September 2015, after Brady McCarthy had been held for 27 months in jail, and a further 3 months under House Arrest in Massachusetts, all charges against her were dropped. The District Attorney for Middlesex County, Marian Ryan said: \\"Based on an assessment of the present state of the evidence, including the amended ruling from the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, the Commonwealth cannot meet its burden of proof.\\" Brady McCarthy had been in the United States unlawfully since 2002 after overstaying a visa, and she was then arrested by U.S. immigration authorities, who allowed her to return on her own to Ireland in lieu of her potential deportation. In 2016, the child's parents, who had filed a civil suit with a wrongful death claim against Brady McCarthy, were awarded 4 million (‚Ç¨3.6 million) in damages by a U.S. court. However, the family said they did not plan to press for payment of the judgment unless Brady McCarthy tried to profit from the media attention about the incident. Life after the incident Brady McCarthy lives in Ireland with her husband, an Irishman she married while living in the United States in September 2012, four months before the child's death.

His failure led to his dismissal and replacement by William Stewart. Some sources refer to him as Thomas Cunningham, but the vast majority called him John. Cunningham spent his much of his youth in Derry and visited several times as an adult. It is reported that at the time of the Siege he still had a brother living in the area who may have taken part in the city's defence.Dohety p.72 As a Captain serving in the English Army during the reign of James II, Cunningham was a supporter of the Whig opposition. By May 1688 he wanted to resign his commission as he strongly opposed the King's religious reforms and did not want to be involved in what he saw as the destruction of the Church of England.Childs. The Army, James II and the Glorious Revolution p.175 Following the Glorious Revolution which ousted James, Cunningham received rapid promotion to Colonel and took command of a regiment which had previously been under Henry Cornwall.Childs. The British Army of William III p.18 In 1689 the regiment was one of two (the other was commanded by Solomon Richards) sent by ship from Liverpool to relieve the besieged city of Derry, one of the few Protestant strongholds still holding out against King James' Irish Jacobite forces. Cunningham was the senior officer on board, but his orders placed him under the command of the Governor Richard Lundy as soon as he went ashore. When the expedition anchored in Lough Foyle its arrival coincided with the Battle of Cladyford in which the Irish Army under Richard Hamilton had crossed the River Finn and routed the ill-organised Protestant forces. Lundy was panicked by the defeat at Cladyford, and was now convinced that Derry could not hold out. After at first ordering Cunningham and Richards ashore, he then countermanded this order suggesting that if they were disembarked both regiments would be lost when Derry had to surrender.Doherty p.65-72 Cunningham and Richards returned to England with their regiments and carrying pessimistic reports despite anger amongst many of the Derry inhabitants that two disciplined regular battalions had been allowed to depart without firing a shot. As he had directly disobeyed orders to attempt to land at either Belfast Lough or Strangford Lough, should Derry not be possible, he was dismissed from his command and cashiered but received no further punishment. Solomon Richards was likewise deprived of his regiment. Cunningham's regiment passed under the command of Colonel William Stewart. Robert Lundy resigned his post as Governor of Derry shortly afterwards, and left the city, but it successfully held out under the command of Henry Baker and John Mitchelburne. Amongst the forces commanded by General Percy Kirke which eventually arrived to assist the defenders was Cunningham's former regiment under Colonel Stewart. It has been suggested that had Derry fallen immediately, little blame would have been attached to Cunningham and Richards, but the successful resistance of the defenders raised questions about their negligent conduct.Doherty p.72 References Bibliography * Childs, John.

After a consortium of local mosques purchased a plot of land outside the city limits to provide a burial ground for the county's Muslims, the local authorities unanimously granted permission for the plans. However, opposition grew among local residents and the proposals were vehemently denounced in public forums where many residents expressed strongly anti-Islamic sentiments as the basis for their opposition. Council members and planning officials reported receiving death threats and threats were also made to desecrate the site with pigs' blood and severed pigs' heads. The council emphasized that there was little it could do to prevent the cemetery going ahead, as it was bound by local and state planning regulations. Background Map of Farmersville in Collin County and in Texas; the site of the proposed cemetery is at the far western end of the incorporated area. Farmersville is a community of around 3,500 people located north-east of Dallas; the population is predominately white. In May 2015, the Islamic Association of Collin County (IACC), a group representing the county's five mosques, proposed to buy a 35-acre plot outside the city limits of Farmersville near the junction of U.S. Route 380 and County Road 557, close to the eastern shore of Lake Lavon, and use it primarily for a cemetery. The Muslim community currently uses Restland Cemetery in Dallas but is running out of space there. The location was chosen as most other Collin County cities had restrictions on building cemeteries. Two acres adjoining the highway would be used for commercial purposes to help fund the cemetery's maintenance, 17.4 acres would be used for gravesites and the remainder would be used for landscaping and maintenance. The site would hold about 20,000 burial plots. The location is within Farmersville's zone of extraterritorial jurisdiction, where the city's zoning ordinances still apply. A $500,000 perpetual bond would be used to support the care and maintenance of the cemetery. The proposal was submitted to the Farmerville Planning and Zoning Commission in May 2015 and was unanimously approved in a meeting on May 28. After the plans for the cemetery became more widely known, opposition began to grow among county residents. David J. Meeks, the pastor of the Bethlehem Baptist Church, became one of the most outspoken opponents of the cemetery proposal. Despite being rebuked by Southern Baptist officials that he was \\"on the wrong side of the fence\\" on the issue, he called Islam a \\"quasi-pseudo religion\\" and declared that he felt \\"the danger is so real that I must do everything I can to stop it.\\" He claimed that the cemetery would become a Muslim enclave within the rural community: \\"They will expand. How can we stop a mosque or madrassa training center from going in there?\\". History =Meeting of July 6, 2015= A special meeting of the commission was held on July 6 at which Meeks and others, most of whom lived outside the city limits, protested the cemetery plans. Speakers at the meeting, which was standing room only, expressed concern at how they believed Muslims were buried ‚Äì which they thought might lead to contamination of the town's drinking water ‚Äì and how the cemetery would look. Others claimed that the cemetery would lead to the indoctrination of Farmersville children, asserted that Muslims were \\"at war with us\\" and declared that they did not want their town to become \\"a Muslim dumping ground\\". A city council meeting held on July 14 was dominated by opposition to the cemetery, even though it was not on the agenda. More than 100 people crowded into the council chambers, with others listening from outside. One resident told the meeting, \\"We used to grow onions here. We sure enough don‚Äôt want to be growing bodies\\". Others threatened to desecrate the site by dumping pigs' blood and heads on it. No vote was taken on the proposal as it was not ready to be voted on. Khalid Abdur-Rashid, a spokesman for the IACC who is a scholar of Islam at Southern Methodist University, sought to assuage concerns by clarifying that the cemetery would not be used for religious services. The bodies buried there would be entombed in coffins inside concrete vaults, not placed in the soil in shrouds as opponents had claimed. He commented that many Farmersville residents were appalled by the vehemence of the opposition and had contacted the IACC to express their solidarity and support. In his view, the opposition was a sign of how \\"hate has become a million-dollar industry\\" in the U.S., but he hoped that the controversy would provide an opportunity to improve understanding of Islam and its practices. He characterized the issue as being about human dignity, saying that the IACC's members \\"wanted our community to be able to visit their loved ones in a place that is known to provide honor and dignity, and fond memories of those of the past.\\" The town's mayor, Joe Helmberger, supported the proposal and described opponents' concerns as unfounded. He said that it would be approved if the town authorities were satisfied that development standards had been met and noted that religious freedom was a foundational value of the United States. Other town officials emphasized that they would follow due process and the law. The police chief, Michael Sullivan, said that \\"whoever comes in this is going to be treated the same. Our role in this is fairly pretty narrow, we‚Äôre going to follow the procedures. ‚Ä¶ There is such thing as a Constitution, and we‚Äôre going to adhere to that.\\" Nonetheless, city officials were reported to have received death threats and threats to their livelihoods. Bart Barber, the pastor of the town's First Baptist Church, also spoke out in support of the proposal, saying that \\"the rights of conscience are inalienable, and religious conscience is among those inalienable rights ‚Äì and that includes Muslims. If I can build a church, then Muslims can build a mosque.\\" According to Barber, those opposing the cemetery were only a noisy minority. The controversy was not the first time that Muslim burial rites had become the focus of dispute in the United States. In 2010 the town of Sidney, New York, voted to investigate how Muslims were burying their dead but dropped the matter after the planned enquiry was broadly criticised. Opposition at Farmersville was intensified by a recent shooting in nearby Garland, where two Islamic extremists were killed as they attempted to attack an exhibition. =Town hall panel of August 4, 2015= Abdur-Rashid and Helmberger appeared on a town hall panel at Farmersville High School on August 4, along with City Manager Ben White and City Attorney Alan Lathrom. White expressed the hope that the event would \\"clear up some of the misconceptions people have surrounding the project,\\" while Abdur-Rashid said he was \\"stunned by the opposition\\" and wanted to talk to residents about the proposals. In advance of the meeting, the city issued a factsheet which, among other things, stated: \\"There is no terrorist activity associated with this site.\\" Dallas Morning News columnist Jacquielynn Floyd described this as a fact \\"that ought to go without saying, that really should fall under the heading of 'self-evident truth, you dolt.'\\" The newspaper published an editorial calling on the town to \\"show your better side in Muslim cemetery fuss\\" and suggested that \\"cooler heads will prevail and more thoughtful conversation will replace the uninformed, uneducated and, at times, repugnant points of view\\" expressed in previous meetings. The meeting saw intense hostility being directed at Abdul- Rashid, who was repeatedly jeered, hissed and interrupted by the audience of between 300 and 400 people, with shouts of \\"You're lying!\\" and \\"You're not welcome here!\\" One man shouted: \\"I don't hate you. I don't like your religion and I don't even classify it as a religion,\\" while another attendee told the crowd that Muslims were seeking \\"to populate the United States and take it over\\". It also emerged that there had been threats against Planning and Zoning Commission officials and City Council members. Not everyone was hostile; one woman said that she was relieved that a cemetery was planned for the site, as she would not have wished to see it being used for a big-box store or an industrial facility. Another said that she found the controversy \\"embarrassing, because we're a mockery. The whole world is talking about us... how we're a bunch of hillbillies.\\" A woman living near the site of the proposed cemetery told Abdur-Rashid that \\"We‚Äôre pleased there‚Äôs a cemetery going in, and we‚Äôd be proud to have you.\\" A local representative of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said that his organization had been \\"called on to do illegal activities\\" (without specifying what) but that the VFW would remain neutral, would follow whatever local ordinances mandated and would not seek to prevent the freedom of religion and speech for which its members had fought. Helmberger told the meeting that he did not support the cemetery but there was nothing he could do about it, and it would likely go ahead as planned. The next stage would be for the planning commissioners and the city council to review the plans and give final approvals in the coming months. As state regulations give the city very little discretion to disapprove a plat, this is likely to be a formality. Abdur-Rashid told residents that there were no plans to build a mosque or school on the site and gave assurances that \\"we are not Anti-American, anti freedom, radical, extreme, or dangerous\\". It would not be a Muslim-only cemetery but would be open for non-Muslim burials as well. He subsequently told local TV station NBCDFW that he felt that the opposition was not specifically about the cemetery, but was instead more to do with \\"misinformation, and fear and hate. And until we confront that, in open honesty, it will continue to persist.\\" References Category:Cemeteries in Texas Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Collin County, Texas ","title":"Farmersville Islamic cemetery"},{"id":"47693794","text":"Humphreys County High School (HCHS) is a public senior high school in Belzoni, Mississippi, United States and a part of the Humphreys County School District.

Of his family, we know that he had at least one brother Nicholas, on whose behalf he petitioned the King in 1398, and a cousin, Hugh de Faryngton, who accompanied him to Ireland in 1395 and became a judge there. It is unclear whether they had any connection to the prominent de Faryngton family of Evesham, Worcestershire. Robert is first heard of in 1370 as a clerk in the Court of Chancery.Ball p.169 He was in holy orders. Even in an age when such behaviour was commonplace, he was a notorious pluralist who acquired a remarkable number of benefices and prebends, which included Blackawton, Ludlow, Bishopstrow, Harlow, Morthen, St. Clether and St. Dunstan-in-the East.Workman, Herbert B. John Wyclif - a study of the English Medieval Church Clarendon Press Oxford 1926 Vol. 1 p.270 In 1375 he was awarded the prebendary of Aust, recently vacated by the philosopher John Wycliffe. On this occasion however he clashed with the King's third son John of Gaunt, Wycliffe's most powerful protector and the dominant figure in the English government, who persuaded King Edward III that Wycliffe was still entitled to the prebendary. The grant to de Faryngton was cancelled: he was compensated with another prebendary in Lincoln, with which, it has been said, he was content, \\"at least in the short term\\".Workman p.270 John Wycliffe, with whom de Faryngton disputed the right to a benefice.

Her daughter, Ottavia, married Sforza Marescotti, and the Farnese Pope Paul III confirmed the fief and elevated the couple to the first count and countess of Vignanello. The castle was built around 1574 as the seat of the count and countess. In the 17th century the Renaissance gardens were created by Ottavia Orsini who had married into the family. The gardens still stand and are one of the best preserved examples of an Italian Renaissance garden. The castle contains on the ground floor a chapel dedicated to Sister Giacinta, a Ruspoli family member who was canonized a Saint by Pope Pius VII in 1807. The Ruspoli family was an influential Italian noble family with close connections to the Holy See. Francesco Maria Ruspoli, the 6th Count of Vignanello, was made the 1st Prince of Cerveteri, and the family has used the Princely title ever since. Many generations of the family lived at the castle in Vignanello, although the family had residences in Rome and Cerveteri as well.

Four years later, he was appointed an Imperial Household Artist. In 1937, Okada received the Order of Culture., the highest honor in the Japanese cultural world. Overall, his art career showed an unusually smooth progression. Okada's painting subjects included both landscapes and portraits, and he was especially good at painting portraits of women. Under his brush, women were portrayed with warm skin textures, elegant features, and delicate traits. In 1907 he won the first prize of the Tokyo Industrial Exhibition for Image of a Woman (Purple tone). Later, he exhibited Women in Red, Japanese Bush Clover, Portrait of Marquess Ookuma's Wife, establishing his reputation in painting portraits of women. In addition to his work in painting, he also studied applied art and collected many handicrafts, such as porcelain and glass, in his house.

Chan's first season on tour brought him immediate success, with runs to the last 16 at two ranking events, the Asian Open and the Dubai Classic, and to the last-32 stage at the 1991 British Open. In the 1990 Asian Open, held in China, he defeated Jason Smith, David Roe, Wayne Jones and Darren Morgan, before losing 1‚Äì5 to Tony Chappel; the Dubai Classic saw victories over Joe Grech, Nigel Gilbert, Cliff Wilson and Jimmy White, but Chan was beaten 2‚Äì5 by another senior player, Rex Williams.

Thomas has represented Great Britain at three Summer Paralympics and with his colleagues John Robertson and Hannah Stodel has won multiple medals in the Mixed Sonar class at the Disabled Sailing World Championships, including gold in 2005 and 2006. Personal life Thomas was born in 1977, growing up in the Ogmore Valley in south Wales, but moved to Bridgend when he was ten. Thomas was a keen athlete as a youth and represented the Under 18 Wales rugby union team. At the age of 18 Thomas contracted meningococcal septicaemia. He was rushed to hospital and he entered a six-week coma. Complications resulting from his illness resulted in him having both his legs amputated below the knees to save his life. Thomas matriculated to UWIC in Cardiff where he studied Sport & Exercise Science. Ice sledge hockey career Thomas was introduced to the disability sport of ice sledge hockey before sailing. He was at a National Eisteddfod when he was approached by a stranger who asked him to join an ice sledge hockey team. Thomas took to the physicality of the sport and was part of the Great Britain squad who attempted to qualify for the 2002 Winter Paralympics in Utah. The team failed to reach the Utah games but Thomas' desire to attend a Winter Paralympics, saw him part of the team who four years later qualified for the 2006 Games in Turin. The British squad was placed into Group A, along with Italy and the two eventual finalists Canada and Norway. The British squad lost heavily to both Canada (9‚Äì0) and Norway (6‚Äì0), but beat the Italian team 2‚Äì1 to finish third meaning they could not contest for a medal. In the classification rounds, to find overall placement, Britain lost to Sweden, but then beat Italy 2‚Äì1 again to finish seventh out of eight teams. Thomas was not the only member of the British ice sledge hockey team of 2006 to also compete in Summer Paralympics. Among the team were world record holding javelin thrower Nathan Stephens and gold medal sprinter Richard Whitehead. Sailing career Between the 2002 and 2006 Winter Paralympics, a change encounter with the Performance Director for Welsh Disability Sport saw Thomas offered a role in the British sailing team. Thomas had no experience of sailing, but the team were looking for a person with his disability and physique, and he accepted their invitation. Thomas faced a steep learning curve but persisted as middleman in a Mixed Sonar team alongside fellow British sailors John Robertson and Hannah Stodel. In 2003 he travelled with his team-mates to Athens to take part in his first IFDS World Disabled Sailing Championship, where they secured the bronze medal. The following year the trio qualified for their first Summer Paralympics, the 2008 games at Beijing, finishing sixth in the Sonar class. Thomas, Robertson and Stodel would remain as a team for over 12 years, with major successes coming in the 2005 World Championships in Sonderborg and the 2006 World Championships in Perth where they took gold in their class. They represented Britain in their second Paralympics, in the 2008 Games in Beijing. They again finished sixth. Two silver medals in the 2010 and 2011 IFDS World Championships were followed by their third successive Paralympics, this time on home surf when the games came to London. The London Paralympics ended in disappointment for Thomas and his team mates after they were deducted four points after a team bosun cleaned the port side of their keel after being authorised to inspect the craft for damage. The deduction saw the British team drop to fifth and the bronze medal going to Norway, just three points ahead of them. In the run up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Thomas was part of a third World Championship winning Sonar team, beating the Australian team by a single point.

His pianos were modeled on instruments made by historical builders, particularly Johann Andreas Stein and Anton Walter. Belt's pianos played a role in the revival of performance on historical instruments that was an important trend in classical music in the second half of the 20th century and continues to this day. Life Sources for Belt's life and work include a brief web-posted autobiography from 1996,Belt (1996) as well as biographical articles prepared by Luis Sanchez (a fortepianist and academic), Peter O'Donnell (a fellow instrument builder), and journalists Thomas Kunkel and Rachel Sheeley. A brief article about Belt by Sanchez appears in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. =Early life= Belt grew up on a farm on the outskirts of Hagerstown, Indiana,Sanchez (2011) a town of about 2,000 people. In his family there were two younger sisters and an older brother, who was killed in the Second World War. While young Belt showed a mechanical bent; starting at age 11 he built hundreds of model airplanes; eventually not from kits, but from scratch.O'Donnell (1996) According to O'Donnell, \\"In high school he took four years of metal shop, and even made a working one-cylinder engine.\\" Sheeley continues, \\"His first job after graduating from Hagerstown High School in 1945 was to deliver cattle and horses to war-torn Poland. Back home, he began working in a New Castle music store.\\"Sheeley (2015) He first repaired band instruments, then learned the craft of piano tuning from a local tuner, then moved into maintenance and repair of pianos. His curiosity then led him to experiment with pianos, trying \\"with various kinds of wire and soundboard modifications to learn what he could about things that might affect a piano's sound\\" (O'Donnell). =Finding his m√©tier= His career as builder was launched by accident (Sheeley): \\"It was during Belt‚Äôs tenure with the ... music storeIt appears that if Belt's association with the same music store lasted until 1959, it probably was not continuous; newspaper advertisements indicate that in 1954 Belt was running his own piano tuning and repair business in Elwood, Indiana, about 50 miles northwest of Hagerstown. See , . that he was assigned to tune a piano in the [nearby] Cambridge City home of a childhood sweetheart. On that day in 1959, his former sweetheart showed him a family treasure, an antique German square piano brought to America by the family in the 1700s\\". The piano had been made by the German builder Christian Ernst Frederici in 1758.Date from Sanchez (n.d.). In the late 1960s Belt purchased it from the family and donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; Sanchez (2011). O'Donnell writes: \\"He made drawings, learned what he could about its origin, and decided to build a piano using it as the model: 'Something just clicked in my mind -- that's what I'd like to do.'\\" Belt in the meantime left his home town and changed jobs, working in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in a wood shop making fine cabinetry. It was in Oak Ridge in the early 1960sDate from Belt (1996) that he succeeded in making a copy of the Frederici instrument.Source: O'Donnell. Belt kept his Frederici copy for most of his life, donating it in his last years to the Hagerstown Arts Place and Museum. (Sheeley). The Frederici copy led to the next step in Belt's career: in 1965 he was invited by Scott Odell, a curator of musical instruments at the Smithsonian Institution, to disassemble, measure, and make drawings of a fortepiano there, the work of Johann Lodewijk Dulcken.Sanchez 2011. At the time the piano it was thought to have been built by Johann Andreas Stein, due to a misleading label on its soundboard. When Belt later took up production of replica instruments, the Dulcken provided the detailed measurements that he needed to serve as his first model. Later in 1965, Belt moved with his family to Waltham, Massachusetts, where he served apprenticeships with two pioneers of historical harpsichord construction, first briefly with William Dowd, then for two years with Frank Hubbard.Harpsichord training was highly relevant to Belt's purpose, since fortepianos are far more similar to historical harpsichords in their essential elements (for example, framing, bridges, soundboard) than they are to modern pianos. Belt built a number of harpsichords under Hubbard's direction,Source: Zuckermann (1969) but he also \\"moonlighted\\", setting up a workshop in his basement to work on fortepianos. At the end of the apprenticeship (1967) he relocated his family to Center Conway, New Hampshire, where using the proceeds of his first fortepiano sale (see below) he bought \\"a 3 acre property with a ten room house and a huge barn attached.\\" The barn became his workshop, where he produced several fortepianos, all based on the Smithsonian Dulcken. His daughter Elizabeth Ross Belt, aged about 7 at the time, later reminisced: > My sister and I spent many happy hours in my father‚Äôs workshop, ‚Äòhelping‚Äô > him in his work. He always seemed to find something that we could do. People > of all walks of life, curious about his work, would visit us at our rambling > old ten room house, where my father set up shop in an attached barn. We > entertained many types, from those in suits to the hippies of the day. Of > all of them, I preferred the hippies, because they were the most fun.Source: > blog posting, . O'Donnell continues: \\"Knowledge of Philip's expertise was growing and he was asked to restore the authentic 1784 Stein piano in the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art.\\" The process of restoration provided an intimate look at a historical instrument from a leading maker and the foundation for an accurate replica. =Belt's pianos achieve success= Malcolm Bilson in a masterclass at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2009. Soon, Belt's instruments were being purchased by prominent scholars and performers. Of his first sale, Sanchez writes in the New Grove: > Harvard University professor Luise Vosgerchian purchased Belt‚Äôs first > fortepiano in 1967 and used it in a concert with violinist Robert Koff, > including works by C. P. E. Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van > Beethoven. This performance on a replica was unprecedented in the United > States; Belt had broken ground in what would become a new era in historical > keyboard performance.Sanchez (n.d.) In 1968 Belt loaded his second Dulcken copy into his hearse (Belt's vehicle of choice for transport) and showed it, receiving expert approval, at universities in the Midwest. The following year, he loaned the Dulcken copy to Malcolm Bilson, then an assistant professor at Cornell University, who spent a week in intensive practice preparing for a concert, altering his technique and interpretive approach to match the new instrument. (Fortepianos pose challenges to performers trained on modern instruments: the touch is extremely light and very sensitive, the decay time of notes is far shorter, and the key spacing is usually narrower.) Bilson clearly found his encounter with the fortepiano to be gripping; that same year he bought his own Dulcken replica from BeltSanchez (2011). Dulcken #2 was eventually purchased by the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. and launched a new career focusing on the fortepiano.Bilson narrates his encounter with the Belt piano in an article by Andrew Willis (2006) Jouez le Fortepiano! An Interview with Malcolm Bilson‚Äù, Early Music America, 12(3), 28-32. On line at . Bilson's (quite successful) career raised the prominence of the fortepiano in the musical world, as well as the reputation of Belt's instruments. Bilson later said of Belt: > There were several builders both here and in Europe engaged in trying to > build these instruments, but Philip Belt stands out as the only one at that > time to build a totally convincing, well-balanced instrument. It was in no > case a curiosity, but a piano as perfect in its own way as any modern piano. Bilson also became an articulate advocate of the fortepiano in his writings and demonstration videos, arguing that historical pianos are often better suited to the performance of the music of their own time (for Belt's instruments this would include the works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven), and permit a more complete fulfillment of the music's potential. Another fortepianist influenced by Belt was Steven Lubin, who in the 1960s visited Belt's Center Conway workshop to learn about the fortepiano. Lubin eventually built his own fortepiano replica (with the help of a piano technician friend, Lee Morton, who had served as Belt's apprentice), and pursued a successful solo career with it. Thomas Kunkel, writing a brief biography of Belt, also provided an intuitive assessment of the aesthetic contributions of the revival fortepiano: > Not long after I first met Philip Belt, I fished out a tape he had given me > and popped it into my dashboard cassette player. It was a recording of > acclaimed pianist Malcolm Bilson performing the majestic Mozart piano > concerto No. 13 in C Major (K. 415) on one of Belt's fortepianos. The sound > seemed extraordinarily bright. Toward the end of the opening allegro, for > instance, the notes in the cadenza come in dazzling torrents. Yet, despite > the speed with which Bilson played, every note was clear and distinct. To > feel the difference, I dusted off an old LP of the same piece, record by > another world-famous performer on a modern concert grand. The playing was > beautiful but, compared to the fortepiano, the sound seems almost muted, the > rapid passages of the allegro slurred. It was like listening to Bilson's > version with earmuffs on.Kunkel (1996: 57) Replicas vs. historical instruments Belt's replicas were not the first historically-styled pianos used in 20th century performance of earlier music; earlier efforts had employed actual historical instruments, restored by technicians to playing condition. This approach proved problematic, as harpsichord builder Carey Beebe has explained: > \\"Modern interest was aroused in the possibilities of the early piano by > European pioneers like Paul Badura-Skoda and J√∂rg Demus. The recordings of > these players were initially confined to too-often tinny and out of tune > original instruments, far past their prime or poorly ‚Äòrestored‚Äô or prepared: > This was sadly characteristic of the 60s and 70s, and despite the impeccable > intentions of the musicians concerned, probably spoilt the concept for many > otherwise open-minded listeners.\\" Beebe goes on to say that it was the introduction of pristine-condition replica instruments, as made by Belt and others, that enabled a far more successful revival of historical practice.Source: Beebe's web site Similar remarks were made earlier by the musicologist Robert Winter, who like Carey criticizes Badura-Skoda and Demus's use of dilapidated old instruments. Winter also lavished praise on an early recording of Mozart's music (Golden Crest CRS 4097) that Bilson made with the Dulcken replica he purchased from Belt: > The sound [of the Belt Dulcken replica] is ravishing in its clarity and > expressive powers. Much of this has to do with an apparent handicap under > which American collectors suffer, which has been transformed into an > enormous asset by Philip Belt. ... For Europeans it is a great deal easier > to locate, purchase, and restore old instruments. These items are scarce in > this country, and often the only alternative is to build a copy. If the > builder is a master craftsman, the result is a new creation which retains > all the virtues of the old. On the Dulcken reproduction one hears nothing of > clattering actions or the death-rattles of sainted strings.Robert Winter > (1977) \\"Performing Nineteenth-Century Music on Nineteenth-Century > Instruments,\\" 19th-Century Music 1:163-175, p. 167.Yet a third scholar who > makes the same point is Haskell (1996:190), who notes further that such > replica instruments as did exist earlier in the century were not very good: > \\"the marked improvements in fortepiano reproductions in recent decades has > convinced many sceptics [of fortepiano performance].

Recordings Further recordings on Belt instruments followed the one praised by Winter. Perhaps the most notable were the set of all of Mozart's piano concertos with Bilson and the English Baroque Soloists conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. The noted critic Joseph Kerman praised the recordings and described as \\"beautiful\\" the 1977 Walter replica by Belt that Bilson owned and used in the recordings.The review appeared in the New York Review of Books May 18, 1989, and may be read on line: . For identification of the instrument, see Seth A. Carlin (2004) \\"Early piano: revival\\", in Robert Palmieri, The Piano: An Encyclopedia. Routledge, excerpts on line at A Belt discography appears at the end of this article. =Scholarship= thumb Philip Belt was a scholar as well as a builder; his research included extensive study and measurement of historical instruments, both in the Smithsonian Institution (see above) and in the historical musical instrument collections of Europe. Much of this scholarly work was done in collaboration with Maribel Meisel, a trained musicologist who became Belt's fifth wife in 1973. The newlyweds took their honeymoon in Europe, visiting instrument museums, and the work paid off with measurements of a 1781 Stein in Gothenburg, Sweden, as well as a far more famous instrument, the early 1780s Walter instrument owned by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and kept in Mozart's birth home in Salzburg. A stroke of luck paid off for them, as O'Donnell narrates: > In the late sixties he had written to the Mozart Museum in Salzburg in hope > of gaining access to the instrument. The reply was curt -- only \\"scientists > and specialists\\" were permitted a close viewing and no measurements were > permitted. He sent a second letter and included photos of some of his work. > The reply suggested he could examine the Walter but there would be no > measuring, and building a replica was absolutely out of the question. So it > was that Philip and ... Maribel Meisel arranged to see the piano one morning > before the museum was open to the public. A curator took them to the piano > and, during their conversation, it developed that Maribel had something in > common with him. Her brother had worked with Wernher von Braun (noted German > and later American rocket scientist) years before and so had the museum > official. 'Boy, he was just elated to find someone who was associated with > Dr. von Braun,' Philip says. 'He looked around and said, \\"I think it would > be all right if you want to take a few measurements of the instrument.'\\" The measurements served as the initial basis for Belt's Walter replica, which became his most popular instrument. Belt and Meisel prepared coauthored scholarly writings on the historical piano, which appeared as chapters in the extensive \\"Pianoforte\\" article in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians; the full article was later published as an independent book with Belt as first author.(1997) The New Grove: The Piano. New York: Norton. Historical scholarship played a role in Belt's professional relationship with Malcolm Bilson. The replica of the Mozart Walter that Belt built for Bilson was based, necessarily, on incomplete information. As further research (by others) on this instrument brought more information into public view, Belt continually altered Bilson's piano to reflect this research. Bilson writes: > No one would claim‚Äîleast of all Belt himself‚Äîthat [the Mozart Walter copy he > first built] was 'an exact copy of Mozart's piano'. Important to the story, > however, is the fact that each time information on the Mozart Walter became > available, Belt would take my piano into his shop and rework it. ... He > completely reworked the action with new parts, new balance points, etc. The > bridge was changed, and not only was the instrument releatheredThe hammers > of most early pianos were covered not with felt, as they are today, but with > leather. but a new type of leather buildup was installed, etc. Yet the soul > (if I may use the word) of the instrument never changed‚Äîthat had been built > into the box at the beginning.Source: Malcolm Bilson (2001), \\"Mozart's > Walter piano,\\" Early Music 29:333-334. In writing this, Bilson was offering > a modern analogy to support the possibility of a comparable performer- > builder relationship between Mozart and Walter 200 years earlier, with > Walter modifying his instrument to meet Mozart's needs by adding knee levers > (functionally equivalent to pedals) to control the dampers. The scholarly > controversy Bilson addressed was whether Mozart's Walter piano permitted him > to 'pedal', in the modern sense of the term. Bilson adds that he checked > with Belt how long it might take for him to add knee levers to an > instrument, and received the answer, two hours. =Kits= Belt also ventured into the area of user-built kit instruments, following the lead of Wolfgang Zuckermann, who had introduced a hugely successful harpsichord kit, and Frank Hubbard, who had created a more demanding but more historically authentic harpsichord kit. Belt sold his first pianoforte kit to Hubbard in 1972. Later on (1975-1979), Belt went to work for Zuckermann Harpsichords, by then under the leadership of David Jacques Way, where he collaborated with Way on a kit based on the Mozart Walter replica. The kit was only modestly successful: it went into production in 1979 with a run of about 200 copies, which eventually were sold over a period of ten years.Source: a web posting by harpsichord builder Carey Beebe: During this time Belt was living in two locations: Battle Ground, Indiana (1971-1975), to which he moved to escape the cold winters of New Hampshire, then Pawcatuck, Connecticut, a small town not far from Way's headquarters in nearby Stonington.See Belt autobiography; and for reminiscences of the period the following thread: as well as . =Later life= Belt eventually had a falling out with the Zuckermann firm, departing in 1979. He had some difficulty finding employment at the time, and in 1982 was divorced from Meisel. The same year he traveled to the Philippines to meet his pen pal, Merlinda Dador,For \\"pen pal\\"; see Sheeley (2015). For her maiden name of Dador, see . and the two were married there. In fall 1982, they were living in Pawcatuck, and Belt found stable employment as a piano tuner and technician in New Haven, 60 miles away. He also set up his own workshop in New Haven on the premises of the old New Haven Clock Company, and a few new commissions came his way. The arrangement persisted until the music store at which Belt worked went bankrupt. Belt spent the years 1986 to 1993 with Merlinda in the Philippines. Again he set up a workshop, this time following local custom by consulting a witch doctor, who obtained the approval of the \\"unseen people\\" and offered advice on location and size. The period was not very productive, in part due to inaccessibility of proper woods for building, though Belt did succeed in making a Dulcken-model instrument from locally available Narra wood, later acquired by Case Western Reserve University. He also built an instrument for Peter O'Donnell with a soundboard made of mahogany, another tropical wood (historical and replica instruments typically employ spruce or cypress for their soundboards).Editor's postscript to O'Donnell (1996). Belt's eventual return to the United States was motivated in part by the wood issue. On his return Belt settled briefly in rural Oregon near Eugene then with Merlinda and their three children in his old home town of Hagerstown.Obituary in the Hagerstown Palladium-Item He reestablished his workshop in the farrowing pen of a hog barn on the farm of his sister Lucille,Kunkel (1996:54-56) and continued to build instruments for a number of years.It appears that around 1998 Belt conducted a foray into a different business, the construction of historical wind tunnels of the kind used by the Wright brothers. See and Near the end of his life, a stroke forced him to retire.Sheeley (2015) quotes him as saying, in January 2015, ‚ÄúI sit here and look out the window about all day -- my hands don‚Äôt work like they used to.‚ÄùSources differ in how Belt's career wound down. Sheeley lists a life total of 46 instruments, and suggests Belt kept building up to the point that he suffered his debilitating stroke. Sanchez, writing in 2011, says \\"He completed his last instruments, a copy of Mozart's Walter fortepiano and a Walter pedal piano, in 2007,\\" and gives 45 as Belt's lifetime total. Belt's obituary, cited below, gives the lifetime total as 49. In general terms, it seems that with the passage of time Belt was unable to sustain his initial success at the same level. The peak of his worldly success may have been in 1974, when he had a list of five orders to fill; but when a severe recession hit, three of the orders were cancelled and he was soon without business and forced to work for others. Later on, competing builders entered the field, often sophisticated and with strong scholarly credentials.Today, fortepiano builders often have substantial web sites with high-quality photographs of their instruments and ample attestations of their scholarly credentials; for instance , , and One of the newer builders launched sharp attacks against Belt on the Internet, accusing him of building \\"pseudo-historical\\" instruments () and asserting that Belt had never measured the Mozart Walter (). Over the years, there were again periods without orders.See Belt (1996), as well as this web posting. In the end, Belt's lifetime output amounted to fewer than 50 instruments, little more than one per year. Near the end of Belt's life, Bilson offered a defense of his work in light of later developments: > ‚ÄúThe early work of Philip Belt can hardly be overestimated in helping the > entire musical endeavor move forward. There are now many fine builders, > producing copies of virtually all the greatest masters of the past, makers > whose pianos were praised and treasured by Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin and > Liszt. One of those fine builders was in my house recently, and I played him > a recording I had made in 1972 on my first Belt piano. His mouth fell open, > and he said, ‚ÄòMy whole idea of this movement has changed. I thought that no > one could make such a good piano before the mid-1980s!‚Äô‚Äù Belt was honored in his old age (2007) when the Midwestern Historical Keyboard Society invited him to their conclave in St. Paul and (as reported by Gregory Crowell) \\"made a special presentation to him in recognition of his pioneering work on the revival of the fortepiano ... The presence and participation of Belt at the meeting was especially heart warming for all present.\\"Crowell, Gregory (2001) Report on MHKS [Midwestern Historical Keyboard Society] Conclave, May 2007. Harpsichord & Fortepiano. Autumn 2007, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp. 8-9. He died in Hagerstown at age 88 on 11 May 2015. His survivors included \\"his wife of 33 years, Merlinda Belt; eight children,There was a ninth child, named Steven, who \\"died in a freak accident in 1968\\" (Kunkel 1996:54) ... and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\\" Personal traits Here are impressions of Belt from people who knew him. Peter O'Donnell, who first met Belt at a scholarly meeting in 1996, called him \\"outspoken, ... single-minded, self-effacing, eccentric and feisty.\\" An apprentice from the early 1970s called him \\"kind, intelligent, funny and gifted,\\" and noted that he shared his knowledge with his apprentices freely, ignoring the possibility of future competition.Source: blog post by Janina Douglas, . Wolfgang Zuckermann met Belt on a visit to his workshop in Center Conway, part of the research for his book The Modern Harpsichord (1969). Along with a positive review of Belt's professional work, Zuckermann (a steadfast New Yorker) remarked that Belt \\"had the air of a farmer about him\\".Zuckermann (1969) Given where Belt chose to live, it seems indeed likely that he preferred rural locales.Viz., the small towns of Hagerstown, Elwood, Center Conway, Battle Ground, and Pawcatuck. He lived not in the small city of Oak Ridge but nearby, and likewise with regard to Eugene. The residence address in the Philippines is not known but was evidently rural (see Belt (1996) for the last three locations). The modest-sized suburb of Waltham was probably the largest city in which he lived, a choice dictated by his apprenticeship to Hubbard. Belt loved his instruments and found it difficult to relinquish them to their new owners.Sheeley: \\"Each one was a work of love and each was hard to let go. 'It feels like you‚Äôre getting rid of your children,' Belt said. 'It feels like it‚Äôs going off to someplace you‚Äôll never see it again.'\\" He could not read music, nor was he able to play his instruments other than (in Kunkel's words) to \\"strike a few pleasant chords\\".Kunkel (1996:57) He also had perfect pitch, and could tune an instrument by ear alone, although sometimes he would use a middle \\"C\\" tuning fork to get his bearings.Michael Belt, Grandson His biographers (Sanchez, Sheeley, O'Donnell, Kunkel) mention an interest in \\"spiritual\\" matters. Sanchez observed that at the time of his interview with Belt the builder had been reading a book by the medium Elwood Babbitt. Kunkel notes that Belt's upbringing had been in fundamentalist Protestantism, and he struggled for some time before arriving at convictions that suited him more closely.Kunkel (1996:61) According to Kunkel and Sheeley, Belt believed in reincarnation. Sheeley wrote, \\"His relationship with music and musical instruments is spiritual for him and he believes his past lives helped shape his work. He said that as a boy in a past life, he worked in a piano-maker‚Äôs shop carving tiny and delicate pieces.\\" Belt suggested to Kunkel that he had lived a previous life as Nannette Streicher (the daughter of Stein and herself a distinguished builder) and told another witness that he had lived as Bartolomeo Cristofori, the inventor of the piano.For Cristofori, see blog posting by his former apprentice Janina Douglas, , who hints that in this case Belt's remarks were tongue-in-cheek: \\"There were times he came on what seemed to be an unsolvable problem in construction. He would put it aside and wait until he could sleep on it overnight and the solution would have come to him by morning. He even joked that he was Cristofori reincarnated and that he was just remembering how he had solved these same problems in his previous life!\\" Often overlooked was his interest in woodworking. Many beautiful cabinets, shelves, and dressers were built during his lifetime, and are still in use. Discography * (1973) Malcolm Bilson, solo; Stein replica.

The group was founded by DeeJillz, Elf Kid, Lolingo and Novelist. The group has since expanded with all members hailing from Lewisham and surrounding areas of South London. The crew is known for its youthfulness, adherence to an old school grime sound as well as for the distinct individual styles of its MCs. History  The group originally consisted of four members who met at the age of 15, members included: DeeJillz, Elf Kid, Novelist and Lolingo. The first collaborative material from Elf Kid, DeeJillz and Novelist was released in early 2012 and predates the name The Square. By early 2013 the group had expanded to include three further MCs, Syder Sides, Faultsz and Streema. In June 2013 a bootleg mixtape was released featuring the original seven members of the crew. In late 2013 the crew began to make frequent pirate radio appearances alongside DJ Grandmixxer. Following on from this in late 2014 the crew officially released its first record, 'The Formula' with No Hats No Hoods records. The EP featured one collaborative track, \\"Pengaleng\\" as well as solo tracks from all members of the group. Later in 2014, \\"Pengaleng\\" was re-recorded with additional verses from new crew members Hilts and DeeCee. A music video was recorded for the new version of the song which was named as one of the best tracks of 2014 by Complex UK. In April 2015, highly anticipated single \\"Lewisham McDeez\\" was released, again with No Hats No Hoods records. Local paper, the News Shopper reported that the Lewisham McDonald's in question had been \\"immortalised in the Grime world\\" due to the popularity of the song. In early 2015, Blakie, General Courts and Grandmixxer joined the crew. In 2015, the group received funding from PRS for Music to produce a debut album. On 1 September 2015, Novelist left The Square to further his solo career. DeeCee and Hilts subsequently announced their departures from the group on 7 September and 27 September respectively. On 19 December Syder Sides left the group and Faultsz also subsequently announced his departure on Boxing Day. However Faultsz rejoined the crew in May 2016. On 9 May 2016, grime documentist Simon Wheatley announced he had made a documentary about the crew called \\"Golden Boys\\" after Elf Kid and Lolingo's 2015 single \\"Golden Boy\\". On 25 May 2016, Noisey premiered the first track from the crew's debut album \\"Defeat Us\\".

He was a Minister in several governments. Bernardino Grimaldi, Incarichi di governo, Parlamento italiano (Accessed May 8, 2016) Early years He was born in Catanzaro (Calabria). His father Luigi Grimaldi was the author of several monographs on the economic state of the province. Like his mother Beatrice Marincola Pistoia, both were descendants of noble families. After earning his law degree, he devoted himself to practice law and teaching constitutional law. Grimaldi, Bernardino, Giuseppe Masi, Treccani - Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 59 (2002) In November 1876, he was elected as a deputy for Catanzaro, which constituency he would represent until his death (XIII-XIX legislatures). He joined the Historical Left. Grimaldi was among the most prominent examples of the new political class that would advocate various reforms as well as state intervention in the economy and in the resolution of regional problems. In government Grimaldi served a long career in key ministries. At the age of 40, he became Italian Minister of Finance and Minister of the Treasury in the second government of Benedetto Cairoli (14 July to 25 November 1879). His first mandate was particularly difficult because of the tax on casting grain and cereals that particularly affected the poor, but also was the main economic revenue of the country. Cairoli wanted to abolish the tax to please voters, but Grimaldi opposed saying that abolishing the tax would cause new tax increases. In 1879, he also supported the proposed construction of 6,000 kilometers of new railway lines across the Kingdom of Italy that would be realized in the early 1880s. He became Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce under Prime Minister Agostino Depretis (30 March 1884 ‚Äì 29 December 1888). In 1886, he assured the legal recognition of mutual aid societies in Italy, and a law against labour exploitation of women and children as well as recognition of the dangers of working conditions. Grimaldi also improved the working conditions of farmers in southern Italy and passed a law on agricultural credit. Banca Romana scandal He was Minister of Finance under Prime Minister Francesco Crispi (9 March 1889 and from 9 December 1890 to 6 February 1891, and continued as Minister of Finance and Minister of the Treasury in the first government of Giovanni Giolitti (7 July 1892 to 28 November 1893). His friendship with the governor of the Banca Romana, Bernardo Tanlongo, and the granting of loans by the bank to some friends, as well as the presentation of a bill ‚Äì endorsed by Giolitti and then withdrawn ‚Äì aimed at providing the existing banks the right to issue currency for another six years, were incriminating evidence of his involvement in the Banca Romana scandal.De Grand, The Hunchback's Tailor, pp. 42-43 Tanlongo accused Giolitti of receiving money through Grimaldi.De Grand, The Hunchback's Tailor, p. 46 However, the succeeding parliamentary inquiry excluded in November 1893 that Grimaldi had received more money from the Roman Bank than he had admitted to have received as compensation for his professional services. The inquiry also exonerated him from the charge of having collected, directly or indirectly, amounts of money during the parliamentary elections. Nevertheless, his reputation was compromised, even after he left the government, and particularly when the contents of documents submitted by Giolitti to the Chamber of Deputies were made public in December 1894. Notes of the Banca Romana cashier implicated Prime Minister Crispi (with several drafts and a note for 1,050,000 lire), as well as Grimaldi and other ex-Ministers.Accusing Signor Crispi; The Banca Romana Chest of Documents a Pandora's Box, The New York Times, December 16, 1894 Serious illness Grimaldi was re-elected for the last time in 1895, but had to leave office in 1897, hit by a serious illness rendering him voiceless.

He is best known for his part in a failed attempt to relieve the Siege of Derry in 1689. Family He was born in 1619 and his baptism on 14 November 1619 is recorded in the parish registers of St Andrew, Holborn. The register states that he was the son of Salloman Richards and his wife Ann, a cutler living near the Cross Keyes. He married first Rhoda daughter of Samuel Wilson and Anne Miller. She was buried on 7 Nov 1645 at St Olave, Old Jewery having died in childbirth.Registers of St Olave, Old Jewery They had a daughter Rhoda. He married secondly Abigail Goddard daughter of Henry Goddard, shipbuilder. The marriage took place before Henry made his will on 30 Aug 1647. Her brother Jonathon Goddard was Cromwell's personal physician.Richards of Solsborough, Co Wexford With Cromwell Solomon Richards served as lieutenant-colonel of Oliver Cromwell's own regiment in the Parliamentarian army. He took part in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and was granted 3,000 acres at Solsborough in County Wexford, probably under the terms of the Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652. In 1659 he was appointed Governor of Wexford town. That was after Cromwell's death and perhaps even after the end of the protectorate in May 1659. Restoration At the Restoration in 1660, he was deposed as governor of Wexford and was briefly imprisoned. He was released and was confirmed in the possession of his newly acquired lands by the Act of Settlement of 1662. For the following twenty-seven years he lived quietly on his Irish estate at Solsborough. Glorious Revolution In September 1688 he was commissioned by King James II to raise a new regiment of foot to provide him with reliable troops to counter the menace of William's invasion. As a Protestant Richards seems an unusual choice but he was a nonconformist and James tried to create an alliance of Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants, both of whom had suffered from the Penal Laws. Rather than raising his regiment in Ireland as might be expected, he recruited his men from London and the Home Counties. Following James's flight to France, he sided with William and his regiment became part of William's reformed Army. Cunningham's Expedition to Derry In the early phase of the ensuing Williamite war in Ireland, the city of Derry in Ulster, which was held for William by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Lundy, was menaced by the Irish army of Tyrconnell and James II. William sent Colonel Cunningham with an expeditionary force to Derry to defend the city. This force consisted of two regiments of foot, Cunningham's own and Richards's, together about 1600 men. They sailed from Liverpool in 1689 on nine transport ships escorted by the fourth-rate frigate and reached Lough Foyle downstream of the city on 15 April 1689. That very day Lundy suffered the defeat of the Battle of the Fords, where he led his Irish Protestant force in an attempt to prevent the Irish under Richard Hamilton and de Rosen from crossing the River Finn and approaching Derry. As Lundy's poorly organised troops streamed back towards the city walls, he issued several contradictory orders to Cunningham and Richards. They were summoned to a council of war in the city, where Lundy informed them that it was pointless landing their troops as the city's defeat and surrender were imminent. Richards and Cunningham therefore sailed back to Britain without landing their troops just at the time when the Siege of Derry began in earnest. After their arrival back in England they were both dismissed from the command of their regiments for dereliction of duty. Richards was replaced by George St George, another Irishman. As Derry was able to hold out until a second relief force under General Percy Kirke arrived, questions were raised in the English Parliament about Cunningham's and Richards' conduct. He died in 1691 and was buried in the North Cloister of Westminster Abbey on 6 October 1691. Richards had many children. It is sometimes wrongly stated that he was the father of Jacob Richards an engineer officer, who also served William in Ireland (1689‚Äì91) where he was wounded during the Siege of Carrickfergus. Jacob and his brothers Michael and John were the sons of a certain Jacob Richards and his wife Ann.

Early years Bede was born in Toulon, France and grew up playing soccer. He arrived in the United States in 2005 and played American football at Framingham High School in Framingham, Massachusetts. He also participated in soccer and track and field for the Flyers. College career Bede played American football for the Tiffin Dragons of Tiffin University from 2008 to 2010, earning Honorable Mention All-GLIAC honors in 2009. In the summer of 2011, Bede was on the verge of playing soccer for the Sherbrooke Vert et Or of the Universit√© de Sherbrooke before deciding to play Canadian football at Universit√© Laval. He played for the Laval Rouge et Or from 2011 to 2014. He made 63 of his 78 field goal attempts, including a career-long 44-yarder in 2013, during his college career.

After re-gaining his position, he was the Alouettes' kicker and punter through the 2019 CFL season, where he played in 80 regular season games connecting on 141 field goals out of 171 attempts for a success rate of 82.5%.

The tour As three of the team ‚Äì Murray, Pollard and Yuile ‚Äì were opposed to Sunday play, the tour schedule was rearranged slightly to avoid Sundays; the Queensland match was reduced from four days to three. The first match was against South Australia. At the end of the third day, the New Zealanders, needing 188 to win, were 67 for 6, with Dick Motz 12 not out. On the last day Motz hit his way to 94, with 10 fours and six sixes, but the New Zealanders still fell for 163, 25 runs short, Eric Freeman taking 8 for 47.

In the easy victory over a Victorian Country side that followed, Motz hit 76 in 46 minutes, taking four sixes and three fours from one over. The next match, against Queensland, was drawn. The New Zealanders were in a strong position when rain washed out play on the last day: after declaring and setting Queensland 353 to win, they had taken two wickets for 44. In the first innings Pollard scored the New Zealanders' only century of the tour, 125 in four hours; Murray made 98.

In 1917 he advocated for allowing Sunday baseball games in New York in defiance of existing New York state blue laws. In 1919 he became one of the owners of the New York Giants with Charles Abraham Stoneham. Biography He was born on Staten Island, New York on August 11, 1878 to Arthur J. McQuade and Ellen E. Tuite. In 1917 the New York Giants and Cincinnati Reds played their first Sunday game at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the game both managers, John McGraw and Christy Mathewson, were arrested for violating New York state blue laws. McQuade presided over the case and found them not guilty and wrote: \\"In my opinion there was no infraction of any statute.\\" In 1919 he became part-owner of the New York Giants when Charles Stoneham bought the team. As part of the deal, Stoneham took on McQuade and longtime manager John McGraw as partners, with McQuade becoming treasurer. According to some sources, McQuade was responsible for introducing McGraw to Stoneham after McGraw got wind that the heirs of late owner John T. Brush wanted out of baseball. McQuade was abruptly fired in 1928, ostensibly to resolve strife between the business and baseball sides of the Giants franchise. In 1930, McQuade sued Stoneham, seeking reinstatement to his post and damages for an ouster he claimed was unlawful. A court awarded McQuade $43,000 in damages. While the court refused to reinstate him as club treasurer, it cleared the way for McQuade to take the Giants back to court if he wasn't reinstated voluntarily.

It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach. In the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks. The National Forest Policy of India envisages a minimum of 33% of the total geographical area under forest cover to maintain environmental stability and ecological balance, which is vital for the sustenance of all life-forms, be it human, animal or  Planning and implementation  Specific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State Level Steering Committee and the District Level Monitoring and Co-ordination Committee. At the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch. The seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging. The Forest Department posts survival percentage details on the Department.  Planting models  The program uses multiple planting models: * Avenue Plantation ‚Äì Plants will be planted along National Highway roads, State Highway roads and streets of villages and towns. Species include silver oak, kanuga, neem, raavi, marri, neredu, rain tree, gulmohar, and spathodia. * Block Plantation ‚Äì Planting will be attempted in wastelands, common lands and panchayat lands. These plantations will be raised in the vicinity of villages to meet the fuel, fodder and MFP needs. Species include albizia, acacia, sisso, neredu, sundra, chinduga, subabool and glyricidia. Planting will be performed by the concerned departments. After planting the plantations will be handed over to the gram panchayat for maintenance. * Institutional Plantation ‚Äì Planting will be done at schools, colleges, government institutions, hospitals, graveyards and private institutions and industries. Species include neem, kanuga, neredu, maredu, rela, gulmohar, raintree, badam and peltophorum. Planting will be performed by the concerned departments. Protection and watering will be the responsibility of the best institute. * Tank Fore Shore Plantation ‚Äì Planting will be at Tank Fore Shores. Species include nalla thumma, kanuga, neredu and arjuna. Planting will be taken up by the departments in charge of the mandal. After planting the plantations will be handed over to the gram panchayat for maintenance. * Homestead Plantation ‚Äì Planting will be around the houses and colonies to meet household needs. Species include Neredu, Seethaphal, Usiri, Pappaya, Guva, Neem, Maredu, Soapnut, Badam, Munaga and medicinal plants. Planting and maintenance will be performed by the residents. * Agro Forestry Plantation ‚Äì Planting will be on farmland. Species include teak, red sanders, tamarind, munaga, bombax, eucalyptus, bamboo and subabool. Farmers will do the planting and maintenance. * Barren hill ‚Äì Planting will be on barren hillocks. Species include hardy plants such as sissoo, acacia, nemali nara and kanuga. Planting will be by the concerned departments. Maintenance will be performed by gram panchayats. Achievements of Forest Department In this programme, it is proposed to plant and rejuvenate 230 crore seedlings as follows: * Outside Forests areas ‚Äì 130 crores (including 10.00 Crs. in HMDA and GHMC areas) * 100 crores within Forest areas (20.00 Crs through plantations and 80.00) Crs through rejuvenation. Block plantations are taken up in the forest areas where old eucalyptus plantations are harvested, in the retrieved encroached areas and in the open areas. These block plantations are taken up in a semi- mechanical method (SMM) and labour intensive method (LI). Total achievements as of 2016-17 are 18920 Ha. Planting achievements: *2015-16: 15.86 crores plants *2016-17: 31.67 crores plants *2017-18: 15.10 crores plants  Urban lung spaces  Forest blocks adjacent to major cities and towns are under development as urban parks, acting as urban \\"lung\\" spaces.The vegetation in urban open spaces act as a sink for carbon dioxide. They reduce pollution and produce oxygen. They allow rain water percolation and ground water recharge in addition to facilitating storm water drainage and flood attenuation. Other advantages provided by them to human societies include social and psychological benefits, recreation, better health, reduced stress levels and reduced depression. The air we breathe and the water we drink are the two primary elements which decide the quality of our life. Thus when the open spaces shrink the quality of life of the people also degrade. There are studies proving that people who use public open spaces enhance their physical activity and gain better physical and mental health benefits. As of 2016, 24 urban blocks had been developed.  Recognition  To encourage competition and to recognise successful implementation, the Government established the \\"Telangana Haritha Mithra Awards\\" to award stakeholders including individuals, public representatives, NGOs, Government organizations, Corporate, Rural and Urban bodies. The first awards were distributed on 15 August 2016. The Government established the \\"Telangana State Excellence Award (T-Ex Awards)\\" to recognise exemplary public service rendered by civil servants. The state Government proposed \\"Telangana Haritha Mitra Award\\" for the following categories: * Individuals- General, People's representatives, Forest Department, Rural Development Department, other Government departments * Institutions / organisations- Best District, Best Gram Panchayats, Best Municipality, Best Corporation, Best Mandal, Best Elementary School, Best High School, Best Junior College, B√´st Degree College, Best Technical College, Best University, Best Corporate Body, GHMC -1st, 2nd and 3rd Best Wards, Best Govt. Department The awards are given at state and district levels every year in each category.  Criticism  The afforestation program has faced severe criticism by tribals and environment activists. = Displacement v/s Afforestation = One of the major criticisms has been the regular displacement of indigenous tribal families from their own lands since 2015. There has been a demand for involvement of tribals in the management of existing forests and in implementation of this afforestation program itself. The recent eviction attempt, in July 2020, by the Forest Department of tribal farmers from Satyaranarayanam of Ganugapadu in Bhadradri Khotagudem district of Telangana, women and men were assaulted by the police. It was reported that large police & CRPF forces are taken along during such drives by the Forest Department. In 2019, the tribals in Sasarla, Kagaznagar revenue division, resisted the afforestation program on lands that they cultivate on and this led to unrest and clashes between the forest officials and the tribals. Counter FIRs were filed as the Forest Range Officer was attacked. = 'More harm than good' = The program only managed to increase green cover by only 163 square kilometres in two years revealed the India State of Forest Report-2019 (IFSR). Telangana was lagging behind 7 other states despite positive claims made the government. It was reported that since the goals are illogically high, forest officials who are supposed to be guarding the existing forests were engaged in tree plantation drives. For example, in 2016, when animal carcasses were reported, the Divisional Forest Officer couldn't reach on time busy with Harita Haaram work.

At the end of the tentacles are broad, short, club shapes. There is a series of suckers on these clubs that are organized into eight oblique transverse rows. These suckers are of different sizes with three being enlarged on the third series. The dorsal surface of the cuttle bone is pink, making it highly distinct.Sundaram, Sujit; Sarang, J.D. (April‚ÄìJune 2004). \\"Occurrence of Sepia prashadi off Mumbai\\". Cochin, India: Marine Fisheries Information Service. no. 180. p. 1068. Off Mumbai, India, the dorsal mantle lengths measured from 55 to 95 mm. Distribution Sepia prashadi is very widely distributed, chiefly in the Indian Ocean. It is found all along the east coast of Africa, around Madagascar, the waters of India, the Bay of Bengal, in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and in the Andaman Sea. It is native to almost two dozen countries. Habitat This is a demersal species that lives in shallow waters at depths of roughly 40 metres to 50 metres. It is migratory as evidenced by a very notable seasonal occurrence pattern. In the waters of northeastern India the greatest numbers are seen between January and June. However, during some years it is most abundant between October and December. In more southern Indian waters such as those of Chennai, it occurs in greater numbers between January and April. It becomes abundant during times when there is an upwelling of deep water. Behaviour Males exhibit various displays to attract females for coitus. While copulating, female is held by male, which puts his hectocotylus in the female's mantle cavity. Fertilization is the common outcome. Males die shortly after spawning. Females die after brooding. Hooded cuttlefish may act more curious and confident around divers compared to the behavior of squid or octopus. Diet Analysis of specimens off the coast of Mumbai showed that they were feeding mainly on prawns. Human uses This species is caught in the Red Sea and also in India off the northeast coast by trawlers. It is also caught unintentionally as bycatch in comparatively small amounts off the northeast coast of India, which is not reflected independently in catch statistics. In 2005 in the Gulf of Suez, stock assessment studies identified Sepia prashadi as an \\"under-exploited resource.\\" Population and density are unknown as there have been no studies, and catch statistics are merely anecdotal and under reported. Ideally, in some habitats fishing needs to be curtailed. Threats Increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere causes ocean acidification. This \\"is potentially a threat to all cuttlefish\\", which respond by having a \\"denser cuttlebone\\" likely to negatively affect buoyancy regulation.

It was the second journal in New York City and the only one that criticized New York Royal governor William Cosby, for which reason the journal was burned in its first year and John Zenger was put in prison. Zenger was released without charges, this being one of the earliest cases where a fight for the freedom of press led to a victory in America.  History  In 1733 the only newspaper in New York was the New-York Gazette, and its printer, William Bradford, was a supporter of then New York Governor William Cosby. The Popular Party wanted to attack Governor Cosby, and the only other printer in New York was John Peter Zenger, who had come from Germany to America in 1697, went to New York in 1711, and worked with Bradford for eight years prior he started his own print business on Smith Street.  First publication  Its first publications started on November 5, 1733. It has contributions made anonymously by James Alexander, William Smith, and Lewis Morris. The journal targeted the new royal governor of New York, William Cosby, and his conduct. The journal was freely published for two months.  Burning of New York Weekly Journals  On January 15, 1734, Cosby ordered public burning of the newspaper on Wall Street, close to City Hall, and also offered fifty pounds as reward for whom revealed the names of the Journal's authors.  John Peter Zenger arrest  On November 17 John Peter Zenger was arrested under a warrant of the Council for printing seditious libels in his Journal. Zenger was placed in the City Jail then located in the attic of New York City Hall.http://www.nps.gov/feha/learn/historyculture/the-new-york- weekly-journal-and-the-arrest-of-john-peter-zenger.htm On October 15, 1734, Chief Justice James De Lancey delivered a charge to the Grand Jury accusing the New York Weekly Journal of breaking the law of seditious libel in New York, but the Grand Jury returned with no indictments. Zenger's lawyers, Andrew Hamilton and William Smith, Sr., successfully argued that truth is a defense against charges of libel.Horton, Scott (2011-02-28) As a printer, he sometimes printed books and essays about freedom and liberty during the Revolutionary War. Afterwards, De Lancey tried to convince the nineteen members of the Grand Jury that \\"just by reading the articles, one could tell that they were libels\\", but the Grand Jury returned no indictment again.  Freedom of press in United States  Zenger's victory became the iconic American case for freedom of the press.Alison Olson, \\"The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America.\\" Early American Literature (2000) 35#3 pp: 223-245. online In defending Zenger in this landmark case, Hamilton and Smith attempted to establish the precedent that a statement, even if defamatory, is not libelous if it can be proved, thus affirming freedom of the press in America. However, general distaste for Cosby was the main reason why Zenger was found not guilty, and succeeding Royal Governors clamped down on Freedom of the Press up until the American Revolution. This case is the groundwork of the aforementioned freedom, not the legal precedent. However, if they succeeded in convincing the jury, they failed in establishing the legal precedent. As late as 1804, the journalist Harry Croswell was prosecuted in a series of trials that led to the famous People v. Croswell. The courts repeatedly rejected the argument that truth was a defense against libel. It was only the next year that the assembly, reacting to this verdict, passed a law that allowed truth as a defense against a charge of libel.

Biography Although born in Lisbon, Ant√≥nio de Carvalho was linked by familial descent to the island of Faial. =Career= He began his military career as a volunteer in 1911, joining the 4th Cavalry Regiment in Lisbon. By 1916 he was promoted to militia ensign, concluding the course in the Practical School of Militia Officers () and participated in classes in the Instituto Industrial e Comercial de Lisboa (Lisbon Industrial and Commercial Institute). In 1918, during a period in the Guarda Nacional Republicana (National Republican Guard) he was involved in the maintenance of the regime of the First Portuguese Republic, and was promoted by 1919 to the position of lieutenant in the militia. He became adjunct-to-camp of various generals, and in 1926 became an attach√©. Following 1929 he was involved in the Pol√≠cia de Seguran√ßa P√∫blica commission, and nominated commandant of the police for the District of Set√∫bal, a position he held from 1 April 1929 to 21 March 1939. During this time he was responsible for repressing labour movements in Set√∫bal and other localities in the district, particularly in 1939, when he pursued fugitives from the Spanish Civil War. He was decorated for his services and in 1938 he was promoted to captain in the Portuguese Military. =Civil Governor= For his loyalty to the Estado Novo regime, he was nominated to the position of Civil Governor to the District of Horta after a visit by Marcelo Caetano to the Azores, at the time responsible for elaborating a new political status for the autonomous districts of the Ilhas Adjacentes. By 1940, the districts were transformed into autonomous districts, an privileging the westernmost islands with the administrative autonomy that already existed in the other islands. He was installed in the position on 17 March 1939, a few months before the outbreak of the Second World War in the Ministry of the Interior, in the presence of Dr. M√°rio Pais de Sousa.Fernando Faria Ribeiro (2007), p.77 The islands position was central in external politics during this period, to the point that an Expeditionary Corp was sent to secure the sovereignty of Portuguese territory. He arrived on board the packet steamer Carvalho Ara√∫jo and received in a formal reception on 29 April. Of his term as civil governor there is a general consensus that he was a positive successor of the previous politician in the position, as noted in the opinion piece \\"Dois Homens\\" (Two Men), M. da Costa Melo: :\\"...Moreira de Carvalho was a dignified successor to captain Silva Mendes. In his path in Work, Justice and Truth, he completed the work started and completed his own...[accomplishing]...a weighted pacification policy\\". His functions as Civil Governor occurred during a period of great change in the administrative district, a period of great social tension and politics that resulted in Horta becoming a strategic point for the submarine cables and a port for international replenishment. This opinion that governor Moreira de Carvalho was a pacificator in a district that lived in a period of tension was reinforced by Dr. Jos√© Joaquim Gomes Belo, then rector of the Horta Lyceum, when he took up his post: :\\"...does not offset the assertion that for this peace [which you can enjoy here now] and who all play an active role, we must not fail to recognize that it was he your great worker. It was he who was able to bring together and give conscience to our desires and to live without hardships that overlapped the saturation and fatigue brought on by struggles woven of a lack of understanding, of injured vanities or malnourished pride.\\" As Gomes Belo put it, Carvalho' s three years in office were \\"three years of peace\\", and that they \\"require our gratitude\\", referring to the populous of the district. His term occurred following the outbreak of the Second World War, and Portuguese neutrality meant that Horta acted between Allies and Axis forces (and their forces regularly transited the waters or competed in anti- submarine tactics). At the same time, an influx of Portuguese troops on the islands meant that economic conditions worsened, driving a wedge between locals and continentals. He was able to maintain the peace and stability that allowed President √ìscar Carmona to visit the district. =Later life= Shortly after the President's visit to the district, Moreira do Carvalho began to journey between Lisbon and Terceira due to ailments, which were respectively reported by the local newspapers. By 23 July 1942, he embarked on a Pan American flight with his family for Lisbon, \\"...searching for the best treatments for his failing health...\\": at the time of his absence was considered a permanent. He died in Lisbon shortly after (on 12 September 1942) from his continuing medical condition: he was only 48 years old. A year earlier, his administration named a group of residential homes alongside the public garden as Bairro Moreira de Carvalho, that then pertained to the Albergue de Mendicidade da Horta . Although constructed of wood, the small neighbourhood survived until the 20th century, and later became a reference in the local toponymy. For his efforts to squelch the labour movement in Set√∫bal and capture of Spanish republican fugitives, he was awarded Knight in the Military Order of Avis (5 October 1929) and Grand-Official in the Military Order of Christ (19 November 1941).

It is named after the word \\"Myxophyceae\\", a former term for cyanobacteria. As a monocyclic xanthophyll, it has a yellowish color. It is required for normal cell wall structure and thylakoid organization in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The pigment is unusual because it is glycosylated on the 2'-OH rather than the 1'-OH position of the molecule. Myxoxanthophyll was first isolated from Oscillatoria rubenscens in 1936.  Synthesis  The bright red pigment lycopene is the acyclic precursor of all carotenoids in cyanobacteria. In myxoxanthophyll synthesis, lycopene is enzymatically converted to 1-hydroxylycoprene, then to intermediates 1'-hydroxy-y-carotene, plectaniaxanthin, and myxol. Finally, the hydroxyl group in myxol is glycosylated at the 2' position to form myxoxanthophyll.

He turned professional in 2001. Poomjang's first season on the tour went without any performances of note, but in his next, he reached the last 64 at the 2002 LG Cup - losing 2‚Äì5 to Robin Hull - and enjoyed the best finish of his career, a run to the last 32 at the 2002 UK Championship. There, he defeated Paul Davison 5‚Äì2, Wayne Brown 5‚Äì3, Stuart Pettman 5‚Äì0, Alfie Burden 5‚Äì3 and compatriot James Wattana 9‚Äì3 to set up a meeting with Graeme Dott.

Over the course of the conflict the Houthis have carried out attacks on military bases and outposts in Saudi Arabia, capturing and/or destroying military installations.  Background  In their 2004 conflict against the government of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Houthis accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring Saleh to crack down on their community, funding it with $25 billion USD. This accusation was denied by Saleh, and was not acknowledged by Saudi Arabia. The Houthis and pro-Houthi Yemen army units were deploying effective tactics. Usually, they would first deploy teams equipped with anti- tank guided missiles (ATGMs) - like Russian made 9M113 Konkurs, 9M113 Kornet-E and a few BGM-71 TOW - to take out specific vehicles or bunkers. BM-21s and BM-27s would then target nearest military bases and sew mines along routes leading in the direction of the border. Meanwhile, pro - Houthi special forces would start assaulting the border outposts, while motorcycle mounted teams armed with RPG-7s and US-made BGM-47 Dragons would infiltrate into the Saudi rear. Columns of RSLF intervention forces would thus drive into unknown minefields, or rush into ambushes at places not directly hit by the fighting. Some raiding parties deployed into Saudi Arabia were armed with man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS), but deployment of M167 Vulcan towed-anti aircraft cannons was noted too. Although exact details the effectiveness of either remain evasive, it transpires that during the first year of this war they at least managed to damage numerous attack helicopters of the RSLF and the RSNG, and thus forced their crews to keep their distance.  Timeline  = 2015 = As a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, the city of Najran was shelled by the Houthis on 5 May 2015 and Saudi authorities temporarily closed local educational institutions and the airport. Ahrar al- Najran troops attacked a military base in Najran on 9 July 2015, seizing a number of weapons and electronic equipment belonging to Saudi Arabia's security services, and destroying an armored vehicle and a mortar-launching vehicle, both belonging to the Saudi Army. 2 Ahrar al-Najran fighters and 15 Saudi soldiers were killed in the clashes. = 2016 = * On 31 January 2016, Yemeni forces allied with the Houthis fired 70 missiles and mortar shells at the Al-Qawiya and Jbal al-Dokhan military bases in Jizan province, killing at least 10 Saudi troops. On 20 June 2016, Ahrar al-Najran reportedly seized a lookout outpost near the border. Saudi interior sources later announced on 25 July 2016 that the clashes resulted in the deaths of 5 Saudi border guards. * On 11 August 2016, after a one-year border ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia expired, clashes resumed and the Houthis gained entrance into the west side of the city of Najran. * On 16 August 2016, Houthi shelling killed 7 civilians, including 4 Saudis and 3 foreigners, in an industrial zone in Najran. * On 18 August 2016, Houthi fighters advanced 15 km into Najran, according to a pro-Houthi source. * On 21 August 2016, a Saudi encampment in Najran was hit by a Houthi-fired Tochka ballistic missile, resulting in the deaths of at least 50 Saudi soldiers. * On 26 August 2016, a power station near the border was hit by a Houthi-fired rocket.

Sources also said that Houthi militiamen had captured a bridge linking Jizan's Qaem Zubaid and Al-Ibadiya areas and the road to the nearby Al-Khubah area. The sources also said that scores of Saudi soldiers were killed and injured and six Saudi armored vehicles and 2 combat tanks destroyed. Saudi army helicopters had bombarded the Al-Khubah area in response. However, the claim cannot be independently verified by Saudi authorities. Also earlier on that day, Saudi authorities said at least 14 people had been injured in Dharan al-Janoub governorate, in the southwest near the Yemeni border, by projectiles fired from Yemen. * On 15 November 2016, the Royal Saudi Air Defense Forces intercepted and destroyed the missile targeting Najran \\"without any damage\\", Saudi Press Agency reported. * On 19 November 2016, a Saudi soldier was killed by a missile fired by the Houthis across the border into Asir province, the Saudi interior ministry said.

The reddish hue is vegetation. A superhabitable planet is a type of exoplanet or exomoon that may be better suited than Earth for the emergence and evolution of life. The concept was introduced in 2014 by Ren√© Heller and John Armstrong, who have criticized the language used in the search for habitable planets, so they propose clarifications because a circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is not enough to define a planet's habitability. Heller and Armstrong state that it is not clear why Earth should offer the most suitable physicochemical parameters to living organisms, because \\"planets could be non-Earth-like, yet offer more suitable conditions for the emergence and evolution of life than Earth did or does.\\" While still assuming that life requires water, they hypothesize that Earth may not represent the optimal planetary habitability conditions for maximum biodiversity; in other words, they define a superhabitable world as a terrestrial planet or moon that could support more diverse flora and fauna than there are on Earth, as it would empirically show that its environment is more hospitable to life. Heller and Armstrong also point out that not all rocky planets in a habitable zone (HZ) may be habitable, and that tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ, such as in Europa's internal ocean. The authors propose that in order to identify a habitable‚Äîor superhabitable‚Äîplanet, a characterization concept is required that is biocentric rather than geo- or anthropocentric. Heller and Armstrong proposed to establish a profile for exoplanets according to stellar type, mass and location in their planetary system, among other features. According to these authors, such superhabitable worlds would likely be larger, warmer, and older than Earth, and orbiting K-type main-sequence stars.  General characteristics  Heller and Armstrong proposed that a series of basic characteristics are required to classify an exoplanet or exomoon as superhabitable; for size, it is required to be about 2 Earth masses, and 1.3 Earth radii will provide an optimal size for plate tectonics. In addition, it would have a greater gravitational attraction that would increase retention of gases during the planet's formation. It is therefore likely that they have a denser atmosphere that will offer greater concentration of oxygen and greenhouse gases, which in turn raise the average temperature to optimum levels for plant life to about . A denser atmosphere may also influence the surface relief, making it more regular and decreasing the size of the ocean basins, which would improve diversity of marine life in shallow waters. Other factors to consider are the type of star in the system. K-type stars are less massive than the Sun, and are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (20 to 70 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun, a G-class star), giving more time for the emergence of life and evolution. A superhabitable world would also require to be located near the center of the habitable zone of its star system for a long time. = Surface, size and composition = Kepler-62e, second from the left has a radius of 1.6 R‚äï. Earth is on the far right; scaled. An exoplanet with a larger volume than that of Earth, or with a more complex terrain, or with a larger surface covered with liquid water, could be more hospitable for life than Earth. Since the volume of a planet tends to be directly related to its mass, the more massive it is, the greater its gravitational pull, which can result in a denser atmosphere. Some studies indicate that there is a natural limit, set at R‚äï, below which nearly all planets are terrestrial, composed primarily of rock-iron-water mixtures. Generally, objects with a mass below 6 M‚äï are very likely to be of similar composition as Earth. Above this limit, the density of the planets decreases with increasing size, the planet will become a \\"water world\\" and finally a gas giant. In addition, most super-Earths' high mass may cause them to lack plate tectonics. Thus, it is expected that any exoplanet similar to Earth's density and with a radius under 1.6 R‚äï may be suitable for life. However, other studies indicate that water worlds represent a transitional stage between mini-Neptunes and the terrestrial planets, especially if they belong to red dwarfs or K dwarfs. Although water planets may be habitable, the average depth of the water and the absence of land area would not make them superhabitable as defined by Heller and Armstrong. From a geological perspective, the optimal mass of a planet is about 2 M‚äï, so it must have a radius that keeps the density of the Earth among 1.2 and 1.3R‚äï. The average depth of the oceans also affects the habitability of a planet. The shallow areas of the sea, given the amount of light and heat they receive, usually are more comfortable for aquatic species, so it is likely that exoplanets with a lower average depth are more suitable for life. More massive exoplanets would tend to have a regular surface gravity, which can mean shallower‚Äîand more hospitable‚Äîocean basins. = Geology = Plate tectonics, in combination with the presence of large bodies of water on a planet, is able to maintain high levels of carbon dioxide () in its atmosphere. This process appears to be common in geologically active terrestrial planets with a significant rotation speed. The more massive a planetary body, the longer time it will generate internal heat, which is a major contributing factor to plate tectonics. However, excessive mass can also slow plate tectonics because of increased pressure and viscosity of the mantle, which hinders the sliding of the lithosphere. Research suggests that plate tectonics peaks in activity in bodies with a mass between 1 and 5M‚äï, with an optimum mass of approximately 2M‚äï. If the geological activity is not strong enough to generate a sufficient amount of greenhouse gases to increase global temperatures above the freezing point of water, the planet could experience a permanent ice age, unless the process is offset by an intense internal heat source such as tidal heating or stellar irradiation. =Magnetosphere= Another feature favorable to life is a planet's potential to develop a strong magnetosphere to protect its surface and atmosphere from cosmic radiation and stellar winds, especially around red dwarf stars. Less massive bodies and those with a slow rotation, or those that are tidally locked, have a weak or no magnetic field, which over time can result in the loss of a significant portion of its atmosphere, especially hydrogen, by hydrodynamic escape. tropical regions of Earth. In the picture, mangrove in Cambodia. = Temperature and climate = The optimum temperature for Earth- like life in general is unknown, although it appears that on Earth organism diversity has been greater in warmer periods. It is therefore possible that exoplanets with slightly higher average temperatures than that of Earth are more suitable for life. The thermoregulatory effect of large oceans on exoplanets located in a habitable zone may maintain a moderate temperature range. In this case, deserts would be more limited in area and would likely support habitat-rich coastal environments. However, studies suggest that Earth already lies near to the inner edge of the habitable zone of the Solar System, and that may harm its long-term livability as the luminosities of main- sequence stars steadily increase over time, pushing the habitable zone outwards. Therefore, superhabitable exoplanets must be warmer than Earth, yet orbit further out than Earth does and closer to the center of the system's habitable zone. This would be possible with a thicker atmosphere or with a higher concentration of greenhouse gases. = Star = Habitable zone (HZ) position of some of the most similar and average surface temperature exoplanets. The star's type largely determines the conditions present in a system. The most massive stars O, B, and A have a very short life cycle, quickly leaving the main sequence. In addition, O-type stars produce a photoevaporation effect that prevents the accretion of planets around the star. On the opposite side, the less massive M-and K-types are by far the most common and long-lived stars of the universe, but their potential for supporting life is still under study. Their low luminosity reduces the size of the habitable zone, which are exposed to ultraviolet radiation outbreaks that occur frequently, especially during their first billion year of existence. When a planet's orbit is too short, it can cause tidal locking of the planet, where it always presents the same hemisphere to the star, known as day hemisphere. Even if the existence of life were possible in a system of this type, it is unlikely that any exoplanet belonging to a red dwarf star would be considered superhabitable. Dismissing both ends, systems with a K-type stars offer the best habitable zones for life. K-type stars allow the formation of planets around them, have a long life expectancy, and provide a stable habitable zone free of the effects of excessive proximity to its star. Furthermore, the radiation produced by a K-type star is low enough to allow complex life without the need for an atmospheric ozone layer. They are also the most stable and their habitable zone does not move very much during its lifetime, so a terrestrial analog located near a K-type star may be habitable for almost all of the main sequence. = Orbit and rotation = Artistic impression of a possible Earth analog, Kepler-186f. Some superhabitable planets could have a similar appearance and may not have important differences with Earth. Experts have not reached a consensus about what is the optimal rotation speed for an exoplanet, but it should not be too fast nor too slow. The latter case can cause some problems similar to those observed in Venus, which completes one rotation every 243 Earth days and as a result, cannot generate an Earth-like magnetic field. Ideally, the orbit of a superhabitable world be at the midpoint of the habitable zone of its star system. = Atmosphere = There are no solid arguments to explain if Earth's atmosphere has the optimal composition to host life. On Earth, during the period when coal was first formed, atmospheric oxygen () levels were up to 35%, and coincided with the periods of greatest biodiversity. So, assuming that the presence of a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is essential for exoplanets to develop complex life forms, the percentage of oxygen relative to the total atmosphere appears to limit the maximum size of the planet for optimum superhabitability and ample biodiversity. Also, the atmospheric density should be higher in more massive planets, which reinforces the hypothesis that super-Earths can provide superhabitable conditions. = Age = metal-free stars, which probably prevented planet formation. In a biological context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species have had more time to evolve, adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions to sustain a suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants. However, for many years it was thought that since older star systems have lower metallicity, they should display low planet formation, and thus such old planets may have been scant in the beginning, but the number of metallic items in the universe must have grown steadily since its inception. The first exoplanetary discoveries, mostly gas giants orbiting very close to their stars, known as Hot Jupiters, suggest that planets were rare in systems with low metallicity, which invited suspicion of a time limit on the appearance of the first objects landmass. Later, in 2012, the Kepler telescope's observations allowed experts to find out that this relationship is much more restrictive in systems with Hot Jupiters, and that terrestrial planets could form in stars of much lower metallicity, to some extent. It is now thought that the first Earth-mass objects should appear sometime between 7 and 12 billion years. Given the greater stability of the orange dwarfs (K-type) compared to the Sun (G-type) and longer life expectancy, it is possible that superhabitable exoplanets belonging to K-type stars, orbiting within its habitable zone, could provide a longer, steadier, and better environment for life than Earth.  Profile summary  A size comparison and artist's impression of Kepler-442b (1.34 R‚äï) to the Earth (right). Despite the scarcity of information available, the hypotheses presented above on superhabitable planets can be summarized as a preliminary profile, even if there is no scientific consensus. * Mass: approximately 2M‚äï. * Radius: to maintain a similar Earth density, its radius should be between 1.2 and 1.3R‚äï. * Oceans: percentage of surface area covered by oceans should be Earth-like but more distributed, without large continuous land masses. The oceans should be shallow; the light then will penetrate easier through the water and will reach the fauna and flora, stimulating an abundance of life down in the ocean. * Distance: shorter distance from the center of the habitable zone of the system than Earth. * Temperature: average surface temperature of about . * Star and age: belonging to an intermediate K-type star with an older age than the Sun (4.5 billion years) but younger than 7 billion years. * Atmosphere: somewhat denser than Earth's and with a higher concentration of oxygen. That will make life larger and more abundant. There is no confirmed exoplanet that meets all these requirements. After updating the database of exoplanets on 23 July 2015, the one that comes closest is Kepler-442b, belonging to an orange dwarf star, with a radius of 1.34R‚äï and a mass of 2.34M‚äï, but with an estimated surface temperature of . = Appearance = The appearance of a superhabitable planet should be, in general, very similar to Earth. The main differences, in compliance with the profile seen previously, would be derived from its mass. Its denser atmosphere probably prevent the formation of ice sheets as a result of lower thermal difference between different regions of the planet. Also, it has a higher concentration of clouds, and abundant rainfall. Probably the vegetation is very different due to the increased air density, precipitation, temperature, and stellar flux. For the type of light emitted from the K-type stars, plants may take other colors than green. The vegetation would cover more regions than vegetation here on Earth, making this visible from space. In general, the climate of a superhabitable planet would be warmer, moist, homogeneous and have stable land, allowing life to extend across the surface without presenting large population differences, in contrast to Earth that has inhospitable areas such as glaciers, deserts and tropical regions. If the atmosphere contains enough molecular oxygen, the conditions of these planets may be bearable to humans even without the protection of a space suit, provided that the atmosphere does not contain excessive toxic gases, but would require some adaptation to the increased gravity, such as an increase in muscles and in bone density, etc.  Abundance  Set and subsets of terrestrial worlds. Heller and Armstrong speculate that the number of superhabitable planets can far exceed that of Earth analogs: less massive stars in the main sequence are more abundant than the larger and brighter stars, so there are more orange dwarfs than solar analogues. It is estimated that about 9% of stars in the Milky Way are K-type stars. Another point favoring the predominance of superhabitable planets in regard to Earth analogs is that, unlike the latter, most of the requirements of a superhabitable world can occur spontaneously and jointly simply by having a higher mass. A planetary body close to 2 or 3M‚äï should have longer-lasting plate tectonics and also will have a larger surface area in comparison to Earth. Similarly, it is likely that its oceans are shallower by the effect of gravity on the planet's crust, its gravitational field more intense and, a denser atmosphere. By contrast, Earth-mass planets may have a wider range of conditions. For example, some may sustain active tectonics for a shorter time period and will therefore end up with lower air density than Earth, increasing the probability of developing global ice coverage, or even a permanent Snowball Earth scenario. Another negative effect of lower atmospheric density can be manifested in the form of thermal oscillations, which can lead to high variability in the global climate and increase the chance for catastrophic events. In addition, by having a weaker magnetosphere, such planets may lose their atmospheric hydrogen by hydrodynamic escape easier and become a desert planet. Any of these examples could prevent the emergence of life on a planet's surface. In any case, the multitude of scenarios that can turn an Earth-mass planet located in the habitable zone of a solar analogue into an inhospitable place are less likely on a planet that meets the basic features of a superhabitable world, so that the latter should be more common. In September 2020, astronomers identified 24 superhabitable planet contenders, from among more than 4000 confirmed exoplanets at present, based on astrophysical parameters, as well as the natural history of known life forms on the Earth.  Superhabitable planets discovered so far  Researchers have identified 24 planets that are \\"superhabitable\\", i.e. that offer conditions more suitable for life than Earth does.

He was the architect of Burma's non-alignment policy, an advocate for a Third Force position of post-colonial countries, and a main initiator of the Asian Socialist Conference. As a proponent of import substitution, he pursued the industrialization of Burma in the 1950s. The scholar Renaud Egreteau called U Kyaw Nyein \\"the brain of Burma's drive to socialism.\\" He achieved a breakthrough in negotiations with Japan on war reparations, which paved the way for a peace deal normalizing Burma's diplomatic relationship with Japan and set a model for Philippines and Indonesia that were in a deadlock with Japan over the same issue. Early life and education Kyaw Nyein was born January 19, 1913, in Pyinmana, British Burma as third child to Daw Thon and Po Toke, a lawyer and leader of the General Council of Burmese Associations. He attended the King Edward Memorial School in Pyinmana where he befriended Than Tun, who would later become chairman of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB). In 1930, he entered Mandalay College to study science and became engaged in university politics. Together with Thein Pe Myint, U Tun Ohn and other students, he fought against the closing down of Mandalay College. After passing the Intermediate exam in 1933, Kyaw Nyein and Thein Pe Myint transferred from Mandalay College to Rangoon University, where he joined the English Honors program. Following his graduation in 1936, he entered law school and received his law degree in 1939. Independence Movement (1933-1947) =Student activism= Kyaw Nyein became involved in student politics at Rangoon University in the academic year 1933/34. He made friends with freshman student Aung San while both were hospitalized in the university infirmary in 1933 and introduced him later to Thein Pe Myint and Than Tun. In the same year, he run in the elections for the executive council of the Rangoon University Student Union (RUSU) together with Thein Pe and Aung San, and after being elected, became editor of the RUSU Bulletin. By the end of 1935, the RUSU executive council was dominated by political students and presided over by Nu, a senior law student and friend who described Kyaw Nyein as \\"an easy conversationalist with a good sense of humour.‚Äù During the university student strike of 1936, Nu, Raschid, Aung San and Kyaw Nyein formed a strike council and set the strike strategy and objectives. As the protests persisted and spread to other schools and colleges in the country, they wrested major concessions from the university administration. Raschid recalled that ‚Äûthe burden of negotiating and operational leadership fell to Aung San, Kyaw Nyein and myself.\\" After the strike, Kyaw Nyein, Aung San and other strike leaders established the All Burma Student Union (ABSU) to organize students nationwide. In 1937 or 1938, while preparing for his law degree, Kyaw Nyein began to work at the customs department to provide for his parents and support himself and his political friends. In 1939, he founded together with Thakin Mya, Aung San, Ba Swe and Thakin Chit the People‚Äôs Revolutionary Party (PRP), which organized clandestine activities for a planned armed struggle against the British. =Second World War and Japanese Occupation= Aung San had left Burma in 1940 and established contact with Japanese army intelligence officer Suzuki Keiji. In early 1941, the PRP leadership embraced Aung San's plan for an armed uprising supported by the Japanese intelligence unit Minami Kikan (ja). Kyaw Nyein and other PRP members selected and sent young nationalists -later to be known as the Thirty Comrades- to Japan for military training. In February 1942, he recruited over 200 Burmese soldiers of the Burma Rifles and took them in pilfered trucks to Tharrawaddy where they were supposed to foment a local rebellion together with Ne Win and Yan Aung of the Thirty Comrades before the Japanese troops arrived. The plan failed, and Kyaw Nyein and Ne Win reportedly had to walk back to Yangon by foot. During the Japanese occupation of Burma, Kyaw Nyein was Cabinet Secretary in the Civil Executive Administration under Prime Minister Dr. Ba Maw, and later served as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In August 1944, he participated in negotiations between members of the Communist Party of Burma, the PRP and the Burma National Army that led to the founding of the anti-Japanese resistance organization, Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO), which was later renamed Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL). Kyaw Nyein was a member of the AFO Supreme Council, the Military Council, and the Executive Committee and assigned as Political Commissar to Divison (6), Pyinmana. =Struggle for Independence= After the war and the return of the British colonial administration, Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Mya, Ba Swe and other AFPFL members founded the Burma Socialist Party (BSP) to counter the growing influence of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) within the AFPFL, which was by now the major political alliance and umbrella-organization in Burma's struggle for independence. Thakin Mya became the chairman of the BSP while Ba Swe served as general secretary and Kyaw Nyein as joint secretary. Amidst growing tensions within the AFPFL, Than Tun from the CPB resigned in June 1946 as General Secretary of the AFPFL. In August 1946, Kyaw Nyein was appointed as new General Secretary by the AFPFL Supreme Council presided over by Aung San. He was an advisor to Aung San in the London Talks with Prime Minister Clement Attlee on Burma‚Äôs independence in January 1947. Upon his return from London, he was handed the portfolio of Minister for Home and Judiciary in the Governor's Executive Council. He accompanied U Nu in July 1947 to London for further negotiations with Prime Minister Attlee, and on the way back, visited Yugoslavia to study the country's constitution and socialist system as a member of the Special Committee of Burma‚Äôs Constitutional Assembly. Certain features of the Yugoslav Constitution, particularly those relating to minorities, were eventually incorporated in Burma‚Äôs 1947 constitution. Political Role and Initiatives in Independent Burma (1948-1958) =Post-independence Government under Prime Minister U Nu (1948-1949)= Kyaw Nyein served as the first post-independence Minister of Home Affairs and in September 1948 assumed additionally the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister U Nu.https://Myanmar.gov.mm/ministry-of-foreign-affairs =Defending Burma's Neutralism (1949)= In 1949, at the height of the communist insurgency when the central government was only in control of Rangoon, Kyaw Nyein and five fellow socialist ministers resigned from the government under unclear circumstances. According to the account of one of the ministers, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Ne Win had forced their resignation. One day in March, the General had entered a cabinet meeting alleging that he had struck a deal with the communists who were ready to join the government under his (Ne Win's) leadership and under the condition that all socialist ministers resigned. Kyaw Nyein and the other socialist minister1s stepped aside but demanded that Prime Minister U Nu should remain the head of government. Eventually, Ne Win canceled negotiations with the communists but assumed the civilian positions of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister in Nu's government while remaining the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. After the failed negotiations with the communists, General Ne Win considered assistance from the West and traveled with Minister for Foreign Affairs E Maung to London and Washington showing willingness for a possible Pacific area security pact. At the same time, Prime Minister U Nu declared in a speech in parliament that Burma should enter into economic and defense treaties with countries of economic interest. U Kyaw Nyein as Secretary General of the AFFPL and leader of the Socialist majority in parliament defended Burma's neutralism warning of the dangers of becoming associated with power blocs. Later in the year, as neither the United States nor Britain were willing to assist Burma's government in their fight against the insurgents, U Nu reaffirmed Burma's neutralism declaring that he sought neither anti-Left nor anti-Right but only anti-aggression pacts. Ne Win left the cabinet in September 1950. Kyaw Nyein returned to U Nu's cabinet in 1951, where he created and served in several ministries and additionally assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1954 until 1958. =Economic Initiatives and Industrialization= Kyaw Nyein set up the Ministry of Cooperatives in 1951, which he handed over to U Tun Win in 1954 to create the Ministry of Industry. In 1956, he became Deputy Prime Minister of National Economy to oversee and coordinate the industrialization of Burma. =Building Burma's Non-alignment Policy= Asian Socialist Conference Kyaw Nyein was described as a moderate Socialist, less doctrinaire than some of his colleagues in the socialist party, and an outspoken critic of the \\"new imperialism\\" of the Soviet Union. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Asian Socialist Conference and headed the 'Preparatory Committee for the first Conference of Asian Socialist Parties' in March 1952 in Yangon, which also initiated the publication of Socialist Asia, the organ of the Asian Socialist Conference. =Diplomacy and Foreign Policy= In August 1954, Kyaw Nyein began negotiations with the Japanese government in Tokyo over reparation payments for damages inflicted on Burma during the war. He eventually signed an agreement on 25 September with foreign minister Katsuo Okazaki that set the pattern for later settlements with the Philippines and Indonesia whose negotiations with Japan had been in a deadlock holding up the normalization of diplomatic relations. The settlement was followed by a historical peace pact between Japan and Burma, which he signed in Rangoon on 6 November 1954. Opposition Politics (1958-1968) =AFPFL Split (1958)= After the split of the AFPFL in 1958, Kyaw Nyein became a leader of the Stable AFPFL faction alongside Ba Swe. =Political Life after the Coup d'√©tat of 1962= Kyaw Nyein was detained in August 1963 after General Ne Win had staged a coup d'√©tat in March 1962. He was released in February 1968 at the height of tensions between Burma and China and an escalating civil war between Burma's armed forces and the China-backed Burma Communist Party. In the same year, Kyaw Nyein and other veteran politicians among them U Nu and U Ba Swe were invited by General Ne Win, who chaired the Revolutionary Council, to advise the council on drafting a national constitution and \\"ways of improving the country's stability and prosperity.\\" He was part of a group of twenty-one politicians who proposed the return to democracy with a mixed economy. A minority of eleven from a total of thirty-three members of the advisory committee recommended a one-party system. Ne Win rejected the majority advice. In 1974, he established a Soviet-style one-party socialist system based on a new constitution. Personal Life and Death Kyaw Nyein met his future wife Daw Nwe Nwe Yee, a Burmese honor student, while teaching English as a tutor at the Rangoon University sometime in 1936 or 1937. They married in 1943 and had seven children, four boys and three girls. He died in Rangoon after a long illness on 29 June 1986, aged 73. External Links * Burma: A Special Supplement.

It adopts the principles of the development of open web standards for the creation of video standards that can serve as royalty-free alternatives to the hitherto dominant standards of the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and the related business model that exploits intellectual property through patent royalties and became associated with financial uncertainties, especially for internet companies and innovators. Its first project was to develop AV1, a new open video codec and format as a successor to VP9 and a royalty-free alternative to HEVC, which uses elements from Daala, Thor, and VP10. The governing members are Amazon, Apple, ARM, Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Nvidia, Samsung Electronics and Tencent. History Some collaboration and some work that would later be merged into AV1 predates the official launch of the Alliance. Following the successful standardization of an audio standard in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2012, a working group for the standardization of a royalty-free video format began to form under the lead of people from the Xiph.org Foundation, who had begun working on their experimental video format Daala back in 2010. In May 2015, the Internet Video Codec working group (NetVC) of the IETF was officially started and presented with coding techniques from Xiph's/Mozilla's Daala. Cisco Systems joined forces and offered their own prototype format Thor to the working group on July 22. The lack of a suitable video format that made the W3C end up not putting a video format in the specification for HTML5 and the failed negotiations for one mandatory video format for WebRTC showed need for a competitive open video standard. The emergence of a second patent pool for HEVC (HEVC Advance) in spring 2015 provided some important motivational background for investments in an alternative video format and growing support the Alliance because it spread uncertainty regarding royalties for MPEG's next-generation video format, HEVC. On September 1, 2015, the Alliance for Open Media was announced with the goal of developing a royalty free video format as an alternative to licensed formats such as H.264 and HEVC. The founding members are Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. The plan was to release the video format by 2017. The alliance saw expansion of its member list since inception. On April 5, 2016, the Alliance for Open Media announced that AMD, ARM, and Nvidia had joined, and Adobe, Ateme, Ittiam and Vidyo joined in the months following. On November 13, 2017, Facebook later joined as a governing member. In January 2018 the alliance's website was quietly updated to add Apple as a governing member of the alliance. On April 3, 2019, Samsung Electronics joined as a governing member. October 1, 2019, Tencent joined as a governing member. In 2018, the founder and chairman of the MPEG acknowledged the Alliance to be the biggest threat to their business model, furthermore stating that: AOMedia Video The Alliance's first project is the creation of a next-generation state of the art open video compression format and codec that is optimized for streaming media over the internet, for both commercial and non-commercial content, including user-generated content. A line of new video formats named AOMedia Video (AV) is being developed. Alliance members from the chip industry (AMD, ARM, Intel, Nvidia) are meant to ensure hardware-friendly design. AOMedia planned for the first version of its format (AV1) to be completed before the end of 2017. However, work on the bitstream specification will be continued in 2018. It is assumed to get rapid adoption and is the primary contender for standardisation by the video coding standard working group NetVC of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Main distinguishing features of AV1 are its royalty-free licensing terms and state of the art performance. AV1 is specifically designed for real-time applications and for higher resolutions than typical usage scenarios of the current generation (H.264) of video formats. Operation and structure The Alliance is incorporated in the USA as a tax-exempt non-profit organization and a subsidiary \\"project\\" of the independent Joint Development Foundation (JDF) that's also headquartered in Wakefield. The Alliance will release new video codecs as free software under the BSD 2-Clause License. It adopted the patent rules of the W3C which mandate technology contributors to disclose all patents that may be relevant and to agree to a royalty-free patent license. The Alliance's patent license contains a defensive termination clause to discourage patent lawsuits. Software development happens in the open using a public source code repository and issue tracking system, and welcomes contributions from the general public. Contributions have to pass internal reviews and gain consensus for their adoption. Different sub-groups inside the Alliance handle testing, reviews for IPR/patent problems hardware- friendliness, and editing of specification documents.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thvSyJN1vsA There are two levels of membership: organizations can join as an ordinary member, or as a governing member with a seat on the board of directors. Confusingly, these are dubbed \\"founding members\\" in AOM terminology, although they need not be members since the Alliance was founded. There is a broad representation of the video industry among the Alliance members, featuring several hardware, software, and content producers, OTT video distributors, providers of real-time conferencing solutions, and browser vendors. Several AOM members have previously worked on MPEG's HEVC and hold patents to it (e.g. BBC, Intel, Cisco, Vidyo, Apple, Microsoft, and Broadcom).

Randy (left) and Sammy J post-show in the Garden of Unearthly Delights at the 2016 Adelaide Fringe Festival. Randy Feltface, mostly referred to merely as Randy, or, on occasion, Randy the Purple Puppet, is an Australian puppet comedian voiced and operated by Heath McIvor. Randy is a permanent fixture on the international stand-up circuit, and makes regular guest appearances on Australian television. He also performs as one half of the musical comedy duo \\"Sammy J and Randy\\", who made their television sitcom debut in 2015 with Sammy J & Randy in Ricketts Lane on ABC in Australia, for which Randy is credited as co-writer and lead actor. In 2019, Randy competed in the American reality television comedy competition series Bring the Funny, making it to the second round (the \\"Comedy Clash\\").  Fictography  Randy has been noted to have an unusually elaborate life story for a puppet comedian; however, McIvor claims that it has changed over time and that Randy sometimes makes stuff up on the spot. = Early stand-up career = Randy's first acting gig was in a presentation on workplace bullying. Having gained a taste for showbiz, he soon began to make occasional appearances on the stand-up circuit. Randy and Sammy J first met when they shared a bill; shortly after they began performing together at the Butterfly Club in South Melbourne as Sammy J & Randy. Randy's first full length solo show was Randy's Postcards from Purgatory, which debuted at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2009 to critical acclaim. = Personal life = In his first full length show, Randy's Postcards from Purgatory, Randy revealed he was 38 years old, working children's parties on the weekend, going broke, and facing an impending divorce. He was also a heavy drinker and smoker. By the time of Randy is Sober it appears that Randy has quit drinking and smoking, and is now a vegan. He has also written an unpublished novel entitled \\"Walking to Skye\\", a recurring topic of interest in his 2015/2016 solo show Randy Writes a Novel. During the events depicted in the second show, Ricketts Lane, Randy is sent to jail for tax fraud, thanks to his house-mate, Sammy J, a young lawyer desperate to make a case. However, McIvor noted that both Randy and Sammy J are actors on that show. Creation McIvor and his friend Philip Millar was working on a puppet musical called Tyrannosaurus Sex with a mutual friend Derek Rowe; Rowe, who worked as a workplace consultant for companies, was eventually contracted to create a show about workplace bullying by an insurance company. The show, entitled What's A Bully To You?, originally featured two puppets, but the team realized they needed a third, unisex puppet that could perform a male and a female role depending on the costume: the puppet, called \\"Beverly\\" and \\"Randy\\" depending on the role, was built by Millar, made from remaining tools in his shed, his arm rods being hacked together from barbecue forks. The show was not received well by the company, and McIvor decided to use the character and puppet for an upcoming puppet comedy show organized by Millar called Pure Puppet Palaver, rebranding it as a stand-up comedy act. Style When performing with Sammy J, Randy performs the funny-man to Sammy J's straight-man in the double act, and much of their material is musical comedy. In his solo performances, Randy tends towards observational comedy; in both Randy is Sober and Randy Writes a Novel, he contemplates his own progression as a person and his existential crisis as an artist. He often breaks the fourth wall, pointing out that he's a puppet and can't actually see the audience, or noting that his movement on stage is usually limited to the desk he's behind.

'100 Moments in Australian Painting', 2014, NewSouth Publishing, in association with the Art Gallery of NSW  Early life and education  Tomescu was born in October 1955 in Bucharest, Romania where she lived until age 23. She arrived in Australia one year later, in May 1980. She studied at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest in the late 1970s. In 1977 she graduated with a diploma in painting and two years later she had her first solo exhibition. In 1983 she completed a post-graduate diploma in visual arts at the City Art Institute in Sydney. > \\"The seed of her career as a painter became planted in Aida Tomescu while > studying at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest in the late 1970s, when > she closely studied the work of Cezanne and his legacy through cubism. She > read Kandinsky's famous essay, 'Concerning the spiritual in art' ... When > she emigrated to Australia from Romania and took up study at the City Art > Institute in Sydney in 1980 she was ripe for a dedication to abstract > painting from which she never wavered.\\"  Career  After her initial traditional studio- and theory-based training in Bucharest, Tomescu's work gradually evolved towards abstraction. She was affected by the bright Australian light, which eventually worked its way into her work. Tomescu said: \\"One of the first things that happened here is that I bought bigger canvases, I increased the scale. Though I was continuing as a painter, I needed a whole new vocabulary, and this would only develop gradually.\\" Her work has been informed by Paul Cezanne and cubism, Willem de Kooning and the ideas of Wassily Kandinsky expressed in his 1910 book Concerning the Spiritual in Art. When she emigrated to Australia from Romania she studied at the City Art Institute in Sydney in 1980, and has not diverted from her interest in abstract painting. In 1986 Tomescu was invited to the Victorian Print Workshop, now the Australian Print Workshop. As an artist who regarded drawing as an important part of her practice, she found the experience of working with etching plates liberating as she had to \\"curb any craving for precision and for controlling an image\\". At the same time, Tomescu \\"loved its transformative powers over my drawing, the way in which it liberated my drawing in the acid tray. Materiality was removed entirely by the acid, so I was left with an image that is really vulnerable, open.\\" Exhibitions Tomescu held her first exhibition \\"based on still-life\\" in 1979, in Bucharest. She has exhibited regularly in Australia and internationally, with over 30 solo exhibitions to date. From 1985 to 1995, she was exhibiting at the Coventry Gallery, Sydney with \\"regular solo shows of her dark abstract paintings\\". In 1987 Tomescu exhibited in Canberra at the Ben Grady Gallery. Sasha Grishin, senior art critic for The Canberra Times found her work to be in \\"a bit of a time warp\\" back to a time when abstract expressionism was the \\"dominant style\\" and the challenge for the artist would be, after \\"redisovering\\" abstract expressionism, to \\"build on it and create their own unique style\\". In 1991, a smaller version of the Art Gallery of New South Wales touring exhibition Abstraction was shown at the Nolan Gallery, Lanyon ACT. Art critic Sonia Barron, writing for The Canberra Times, was disappointed in the exhibition but found at least that Tomescu communicated \\"a spiritual anxiety in her dark expressionist canvases\\". In 1994, the art collector and art gallery owner Chandler Coventry showed a collection of 300 prints he had acquired in the exhibition Obsession. The diverse collection of works included 10 works by Aida Tomescu and art critic Sasha Grishin remarked that her worked \\"places her as one of the leading exponents of gestural abstraction in this country\\". In 2009 her work was the subject of a major survey exhibition, Aida Tomescu: Paintings and Drawings at the Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University.Grishin, Sasha. ‚ÄòPower in the Individual Vision,‚Äô The Canberra Times, 20 October 2009 Art critic John McDonald expressed admiration for Tomescu's \\"sense of colour and surface texture\\". He referred to the paint being laid on in \\"concrete-like slabs\\" with the works on paper consisting of a \\"frenzied mass of squiggles and disjointed calligraphy\\" and found the body of work \\" alive and convincing\\". Tomescu's graphic works were included in the major survey of prints and drawings Out of Australia at the British Museum, London in 2011.https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=138446 Tomescu's work was included in a major touring exhibition, Abstraction: Celebrating Australian Women Abstract Artists, a touring exhibition (2017‚Äì2019) from the National Gallery of Australia.

Critical reception  Australian art historian Patrick McCaughey writes of Tomescu in his 2014 book Strange Country: Why Australian Painting Matters: > \\"[One] of the best painters at work in Australia today, Aida Tomescu has > revived a full-throated painterly abstraction, where colour and gesture flow > through the work...she knits over and under surfaces in which the light and > colour seem to be pulsing from within the work, not just laid on top. You > feel her presence and her sensibility, moment to moment on the surface, in > the painting.\\" Art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald John McDonald wrote on August 25, 2012: > \\"Aida Tomescu, who is consolidating a reputation as one of Australia's most > formidable living abstract painters...is making the point that she is not > interested in arbitrary mark-making ‚Äî she is after something she calls an > image.

Although initially seen as a longshot due to the Liberal Party's weakness in the Toronto area at the time, as the campaign progressed he appeared to have built a stronger than expected chance of winning; however, he was defeated on election day. Despite having run a modest, careful campaign, he was subsequently forced to file for bankruptcy, focusing significant attention on the Canadian political system and the challenges an electoral campaign can pose for a candidate who is not already independently wealthy. At a party policy conference in February 1972, Maloney formally came out as gay while criticizing federal Justice Minister Otto Lang over anti-gay discrimination in federal laws. While homosexuality had already been decriminalized, many laws, including immigration and human rights policies around LGBT issues, remained discriminatory.

It was previously considered a geographic color variation of other anemonefish, initially Amphiprion rubrocinctus from 1972 and then Amphiprion melanopus from 1980 however further study and DNA sequencing resulted in A. barberi being described as a new species in 2008. Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. The fish's natural diet includes zooplankton. Description The body of adults are generally red-orange with a single white bar. The snout and breast are orange. Each of the caudal, dorsal and anal fins are orange. They have 10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 16-18 dorsal soft rays and 14 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . =Color variations= Some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location, sex and host anemone. A. barberi does not show any of these variations. =Similar species= A. rubrocinctus and A. melanopus are geographically distinct. A. rubrocinctus has a distribution restricted to north western Australia while A melanopus is widely distributed in the western Pacific, from the Great Barrier Reef north to the Marshall Islands and Guam, New Guinea and from Vanuatu and New Caledonia to eastern Indonesia. There are significant color-pattern differences, with A. melanopus having a dark brown or blackish body, compared to the red orange of A. barberi. A. melanopus also has 19-26 spines in the upper-opercular series while A. barberi has only 11-19.

A. barberi is specialised, being hosted by only 2 out of the 6 host anemones found in the region. A. barberi is hosted by the following species of anemone: *Entacmaea quadricolor Bubble-tip anemone *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation. While A. barberi has a small geographic range, it is said to be common in Fiji and frequently encountered in Samoa and its ability to use two different anemone hosts may reduce the risk of extinction associated with extreme specialisation. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List.

Typically, the race takes place on a standard 400-metre or 1/4-mile running track. The race begins at the 1-mile starting line with the consumption of a beer, followed by a full lap around the track. The second lap continues in a similar manner; another 12-ounce beer is consumed before commencing the running of the second lap. This process is repeated for the next two laps. Following the completion of the fourth running lap (and four beers), a competitor has finished the race. More specific rules of the race vary by region. In North America, typically, 12 US ounces of beer is consumed from a can or bottle before every lap. A set of rules has been defined and published by BeerMile.com. History James Nielsen helped bring the beer mile into the public eye after becoming the first to break the five- minute barrier in 2014. Since then the record has been lowered a handful of times by runners from all over the world. To date, Nielsen is the only person to run under 5 minutes using cans, not bottles or pints (chunder mile). ;2014 In 2014, the inaugural Beer Mile World Championship was held in Austin, Texas. The men's race was won by Canadian Corey Gallagher with a time of 5:00.23. In the women's race, American Beth Herndon set a new world record with a time of 6:17.8. ;2015 On July 30, 2015, Australian Josh Harris (4:56.2) broke James Nielsen's world record. Harris became the second man to break the 5 minute barrier. The record lasted less than 12 hours. By the end of the day, Lewis Kent of Canada ran a 4:55.78. On August 12, the last four world record holders competed against each other for the first time.  * Canadian Jim Finlayson, another former world record holder, finished third overall, behind Kent and American Brian Anderson. Canada won the men's Kingston Cup. Nielsen was disqualified for excessive spillage. Nielsen's disqualification was the deciding factor in the Canadian men's victory, turning the 10‚Äì11 American victory into a 10‚Äì11 Canadian win. The American women won the Queens cup, with Caitlin Judd, Chris Kimbrough and Lindsay Harper taking the top 3 spots. The 2nd Annual FloTrack Beer Mile World Championship was held in Austin, Texas on December 1, 2015. Kent set a new world record with a time of 4:47.17 and Gallagher finished with a time of 4:48.62. ;2016 On July 31, 2016, Canadian Corey Bellemore broke the world record in London with a time of 4:34.35. Dale Clutterbuck finished second, breaking the European record with a time of 4:47:39 and Lewis Kent finished 4th in 5:11. Canada won the men's team champion, and the North American women beat the European English team for the Queen's cup. The women's race was won by Erin O'Mara, with the British and European record going to Polly Keen of England. ;2017 The third annual classic was held again in London in 2017, with the American men winning the first three positions to take home the Kingston Cup. All three American men were current or former American record holders, with Chris Robertson winning over Dale Clutterbuck. Garrett Cullen earned the silver, and Brandon Shirk earned the bronze for the second straight year. Bryony Pearce was the winner, after Allison Grace Morgan and Laura Riche were disqualified, making England the winner of the Queens Cup. On October 28, 2017, Corey Bellemore broke his own record in San Francisco with a time of 4:33.6 The event had the largest crowd for a beer mile with an estimated attendance of 6200. Bellemore's performance likely would have been faster, but he had to move out to Lane 3 each lap due to soccer benches in the first 2 lanes ;2018 Dale Clutterbuck was the official winner with a time of 4:50. Three runners were disqualified, including last year's winner Corey Bellemore, after race officials measured the remaining liquid in the cans and bottles of the 20 competitors. According to Patrick Butler of Beermile.com, is the maximum amount allowed left over. Bellemore was disqualified for more than the permitted amount. Chunder Mile In the United Kingdom, an imperial pint (568 mL) typically is consumed before every lap, with no specification of the drinking vessel but pint glasses are preferred for the speed in which the beverage can be finished. The one lap penalty for \\"chundering\\" (vomiting) is not generally enforced. The current record is 4:57 by Dale Clutterbuck of England. Clutterbuck is the only person to break 5 in the Chunder Mile, and is also the only person to go under 5 minutes for both the beer mile and Chunder Mile. Five days after setting the chunder mile record, Clutterbuck was defeated by US Record Holder Chris Robertson at the 2017 classic. Clutterbuck withdrew from the race on the final lap. Variations and other Countries Next to the World Championship Beermile, in different countries the Beermile is getting more attention. In Belgium and Holland the Beermile is well known as an off-season race for triathlethes that are competing in the highest level in Holland. In the bigger cities people started Beermiling in the last few years. Unofficial Dutch Records where set during the 043-Beermile (Maastricht)- www.beermile.nl * Edo van der Meer 2017‚Äì6:26 * Robert de Korte 2018‚Äì6:12 Unofficial Belgian record is: * Tom Van Cappellen (33cl Bottles) 2019 - 5:11,6 * Lukas Bosmans (33cl Cans) 2017‚Äì5:18 Some variations of the beer mile are * 4 √ó 40 oz. relay - In this event, a team of four competitors run 100 metres each around the track, finishing a bottle of beer or malt liquor on the way. * Wild Turkey 2-mile - Each competitor runs eight 400m laps, with a shot of whiskey (usually Wild Turkey) before every lap. * Naked 4 √ó 400 m - Each member of a four-competitor team runs a lap around the track nude ‚Äì drinking is technically optional, but encouraged. * Beer 2 Mile - This event involves consuming four more beers for a total of eight beers and eight laps, vomiting only incurs one penalty lap. * Vodka 2 Mile - Competitors consume eight shots of vodka. * Chocolate Milk Mile - Instead of beer, competitors consume chocolate milk. * Female Beer Mile ‚Äì Like the standard beer mile except the first lap can be run without consuming a beer. This rule is often enacted to encourage female participation. Though in elite races like the Beer Mile World Classic and the FloTrack Beer Mile, women drink four beers. The four beer rule can be attributed to former World Record Holder Seanna Robinson's insistence that women run under the same rules. Defunct Race Series Two national race series emerged and quickly folded, the Brew Mile and the National Beer Mile. By the end of 2016, neither race series was solvent, with the National Beer Mile closing operations under dubious circumstances. In 2017, the Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships also ceased to exist. Kastenlauf Kastenlauf (short for \\"Bierkastenlauf\\", literally \\"beer crate running\\"), Kistenlauf, Bierlauf, Bierkastenrennen (literally crate-running, beer crate-running, or equivalents), Bier-Rallye, or Bierathlon, is a drinking sport in the German-speaking countries Austria, Germany and Switzerland. It is a race among teams that consist of two people carrying a crate of beer, all of which must be consumed prior to crossing the finish line. The route can be anywhere from long.

It is common for people to rely on their own intuitions about language learning, though they would not do so with other technical subjects such as physics (a phenomenon known as folk linguistics). However, these intuitions are often contradicted by scientific research.  Childhood language acquisition  = Children learn their first language effortlessly = Learning a first language is not rapid for children. Children spend years learning their mother tongue, and the process continues well into their school years. At seven years old, for example, many children have difficulties creating passive-voice sentences.  Second-language acquisition  = Younger learners learn languages more easily than older learners = It is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults. However, the reverse is true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in pronunciation. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level. = Intelligent people are better at learning languages = General intelligence is actually quite a poor indicator of language-learning ability. Motivation, tolerance for ambiguity, and self-esteem are all better indicators of language-learning success. = Immersion is the best way to learn a language = The ability for learners to develop their language skills depends to a large extent on the type of language input that they receive. For input to be effective for second-language acquisition, it must be comprehensible. Merely being immersed in a second-language environment is no guarantee of receiving comprehensible input. For example, learners living in a country where their second language is spoken may be lucky enough to interact with native speakers who can alter their speech to make it comprehensible; but equally, many learners will not have that same luck, and may not understand the vast majority of the input that they receive. In addition, adult learners living in a foreign country may not have very high linguistic demands placed on them, for example if they are a low-level employee at a company. Without the incentive to develop high-level skills in their second language, learners may undergo language fossilisation, or a plateau in their language level. Classroom instruction can be useful in both providing appropriate input for second-language learners, and for helping them overcome problems of fossilisation. = Grammar study is detrimental to second-language acquisition = The study of grammar is helpful for second- language learners, and a lack of grammar knowledge can slow down the language- learning process. On the other hand, relying on grammar instruction as the primary means of learning the language is also detrimental. A balance between these two extremes is necessary for optimal language learning.  Bilingual education  = Learning a second language hinders the development of the first language = Learners can learn two or more languages without their first language development being adversely affected. There is no such thing as a \\"fixed amount of space\\" for languages in the brain. In reality, learners' first languages and their additional languages become part of an integrated system. = Once a child can speak a language, the language-learning process is complete = Learning to speak a language conversationally is only part of the way towards becoming fluent in it. Just because a child can speak a language does not mean that they are yet capable of writing and understanding academic language. This kind of language is particularly important in school in the later grades. One study of 1,200 Canadian schoolchildren indicated that it may take between five and seven years longer to master academic language than to master conversational language.

He led the Spanish force which perpetrated the Acoma Massacre at the Acoma Pueblo in 1599. He led or participated in several expeditions onto the Great Plains. Early life Vicente de Zald√≠var was born circa 1573. The Zaldivar and O√±ate families of Zacatecas and New Mexico were prominent and intertwined. His father, Vicente de Zald√≠var, Sr., served in the Chichimeca War of 1550-1590 and other wars alongside his uncle (thus Vicente's great- uncle), Crist√≥bal de O√±ate. His mother was Magdalena de Mendoza y Salazar. He had a brother, Juan de Zald√≠var. Juan de O√±ate, the founder of the Spanish colony of New Mexico in 1598, was their uncle and second cousin. Career In 1595, Zald√≠var was appointed Sargento mayor by his uncle, Juan de O√±ate, in their colonization of New Mexico for the Spanish Crown. They arrived in New Mexico in 1598. Buffalo hunting. Food and resources were scarce in the young colony of New Mexico. On September 15, 1598, Zaldivar and his guide, Jusepe Gutierrez, led a group of 60 men onto the Great Plains to determine whether Bison, the American buffalo, could be domesticated. Departing from Pecos Pueblo, Zaldivar journeyed 57 leagues eastward, about , probably to the Canadian River valley. There he found huge herds of buffalo. Zaldivar and his men constructed a large corral in which they attempted to capture several thousand buffalo. The buffalo were recalcitrant and killed three horses and wounded 40 more. Zaldivar then captured a number of buffalo calves, but all of them quickly died.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Joe Johnston, Jeff Liu, and series creator Rebecca Sugar. The episode acts as a continuation of the arc started in the previous episode, \\"The Return\\", and the two aired alongside each other as a two-part special. Both episodes were watched by 1.697 million viewers. The episode covers Steven's attempt to save the Gems from the captivity of Peridot and Jasper, two Homeworld Gems leading a scouting mission on Earth. The episode reveals that Garnet is a fusion, and introduces the characters Ruby and Sapphire, Garnet's component Gems. The romantic relationship between Ruby and Sapphire has been interpreted one of the ways in which Steven Universe provides LGBT representation. Plot Having been knocked unconscious by Jasper (Kimberly Brooks) in the previous episode, Steven (Zach Callison) awakens in a prison cell on the Gem warship. The door of the cell is a force field which can neutralize the strength of any Gem; but Steven is able to pass through it unharmed. While searching for the Crystal Gems, Steven comes across an unfamiliar Gem, Ruby (Charlyne Yi), and disrupts the force field with his body so she can escape. He then helps her search for her companion Sapphire (Erica Luttrell) by following the sound of her singing. Steven and Ruby encounter Lapis Lazuli (Jennifer Paz), but she insists that Steven leave her in her cell to avoid exacerbating their current problems. As Steven and Lapis talk, Ruby runs off in impatience. Steven finds Sapphire and frees her from her cell. Soon, Ruby and Sapphire meet up again; as they happily reunite, to Steven's surprise, Ruby and Sapphire fuse into Garnet (Estelle). She sends Steven to find Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) and free them from their cells. After he leaves, Jasper confronts Garnet. As they fight, Garnet sings the song \\"Stronger Than You\\", celebrating the power of Ruby and Sapphire's relationship. Meanwhile, Steven, Amethyst and Pearl overpower Peridot (Shelby Rabara) and take control of the ship. Garnet and Jasper's battle destroys the ship's power core, causing the ship to crash-land onto Earth as Peridot flees in an escape pod. After the ship hits Earth's surface, the Crystal Gems, Jasper, and Lapis emerge from the wreckage. Jasper convinces Lapis to fuse with her to defeat the Crystal Gems. However, once they fuse into Malachite, Lapis uses her water powers to drag the fusion into the ocean and subdue Jasper. The episode ends with Steven receiving a frantic phone call from Connie (Grace Rolek). Production Episodes of Steven Universe are written and storyboarded by a single team. \\"Jail Break\\" was written by Joe Johnston, Jeff Liu, and series creator Rebecca Sugar, and directed by co-executive producer Ian Jones-Quartey, while Ki-Yong Bae and Jin-Hee Park provided animation direction, and Elle Michalka served as art director. In the combat scene between Jasper and Garnet, Jasper's fighting style pays homage to the video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. Johnston indicated on his blog that Ruby and Sapphire's fusion dance is a reference to a dance between Pazu and Sheeta in Castle in the Sky, and that the series often references Studio Ghibli films. The fact that Garnet was a fusion had been previously foreshadowed; for example, in \\"Coach Steven\\", the fusion Sugilite (Amethyst and Garnet) is shown to have three gems rather than two. Sugar had intended for Garnet to be a fusion since the show's pilot episode. =Music= The episode features the song \\"Stronger Than You\\", written by Rebecca Sugar and arranged by Aivi & Surasshu, the music team for the series. The song was performed by Estelle as Garnet, and includes strings performed by Jeff Ball. Steven Velema (Surasshu of Aivi & Surasshu) wrote that Estelle's vocals were originally recorded over a demo by Jeff Liu. Sugar wanted the duo to create an arrangement \\"to capture the feeling of 'there's no way [Garnet] could lose'\\". In order to \\"emphasize\\" Garnet's new form, they changed the timbre of the bass, which represents Garnet in the series. Themes The episode has been cited as an important example of LGBT representation in children's media because of the relationship between Ruby and Sapphire. Writer Joe Johnston clarified that the two are romantically involved and Jones- Quartey specified that their relationship could be considered lesbian. An Autostraddle article compares their relationship and fusion to a marriage, where \\"two parts [make] one whole\\". The relationship was also compared to similar lesbian relationships in other animated series, such as Adventure Time and The Legend of Korra. The episode also explores the power of \\"partnership, love, and community over power-based hierarchy\\", according to Vrai Kaiser, writing for The Mary Sue. This is represented in the fight between Jasper and Garnet, which is also a performance by voice actor Estelle of the song \\"Stronger Than You\\". In the scene, Garnet represents love‚Äîspecifically, between two gay non-binary individuals‚Äîwhich creates her \\"emotional balance\\" and strength. Eric Thurm elaborates on this point, noting that Jasper's quote, \\"Fusion is just a cheap tactic to make weak Gems stronger\\", can be interpreted as a criticism of emotional relationships. This makes the physical fight abstractly represent \\"a contest between Jasper's lone-wolf warrior ideology and Garnet's harmony between two people\\". According to Thurm, Garnet's victory supports the \\"thesis statement\\" of the series, which is that \\"loving relationships are the most important thing in life\\". The episode acts as a turning point for the show because of how Steven's relationship with the Gems changes. According to Sugar, what interviewer Lan Pitts calls \\"a more serious tone\\" in episodes following \\"Jail Break\\" stems from the fact that Steven has become a more \\"equal\\" and capable member of the Crystal Gems. Sugar states that after this point, it almost \\"becomes another show\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Jail Break\\" premiered on Cartoon Network on March 12, 2015. 1.697 million viewers watched its initial American broadcast and the episode received a Nielsen household rating of 0.4, meaning 0.4% of all households viewed it. It aired as part of a programming event advertised as a \\"Stevenbomb\\", in which new episodes aired every day for five consecutive days. In order to give the Stevenbomb a strong plot arc, several episodes written as part of the first season were postponed to air as part of the second season, after the Stevenbomb. Thus, although \\"Jail Break\\" was written as the 52nd episode of the first season, it was the 49th episode to air. The episode received positive attention from critics, both for its animation quality and the song \\"Stronger Than You\\", performed by Estelle voicing the character Garnet. Writing for The A.V. Club, Eric Thurm called the song \\"funky as hell\\". Estelle also received praise for the strength carried in her succinct lines of dialogue. The episode was nominated twice at the 43rd Annie Awards, in the categories of Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production For Children's Audience and Outstanding Achievement, Storyboarding in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production. However, it did not win either category.

It is characterized from other genera of the Trichocomaceae by the following combination of features: species are thermotolerant or thermophilic; their conidiophores have distinctly rough-walled stipes; conidia are olive brown; and ascomata, if present, have minimal covering. Rasamsonia phenotypically resembles Paecilomyces, in that both have thermotolerant species, produce olive-brown conidia, and form ascomata with no or scarce ascomatal covering; Rasamsonia, however, differs from Paecilomyces in having more regularly branched conidiophores with distinct rough-walled structures. The type species is Rasamsonia emersonii, a fungus formerly classified in the genus Talaromyces. Clinical relevance Due to an increase in reports of human and animal mycosis by Rasamsonia argillacea (formerly Geosmithia argillacea), it has been considered an emerging pathogen. In 2013, molecular analysis was used to identify four species in the R. argillacea species complex, including R. eburnea, and the newly-described R. piperina and R. aegroticola.

The novel focuses on the activities of professional honey-hunter Benjamin Boden, nicknamed \\"Ben Buzz\\". The novel is set in Kalamazoo, Michigan's Oak Opening, a wooded prairie that still exists in part today, during the War of 1812. Background and publication history After returning from his European travels in the 1830s, Cooper was persuaded by his niece's husband, Horace H. Comstock, to invest in Michigan real estate. The Potawatomi had ceded much of their land in central Michigan by 1833 and their former territory became known as \\"oak-openings\\". By 1837, Cooper's $6,000 investment was losing value, though he watched as his fellow New Yorkers attempted to colonize the area like honeybees. The experience inspired The Oak Openings; or, The Bee Hunter, and the novel became one of the first representations of Beekeeping in American literature. Though not the first author to use the term \\"oak openings\\", Frederick Marryat did so, Cooper popularized the term for the type of oak clad Savannah with the publication of the novel. The novel is Cooper's last \\"wilderness novel\\" following his Leatherstocking Tales and serves as a melancholy follow-up to that series. It is also the last of his novels to explore the relationships between Europeans and Native Americans in the early American expansion. Analysis The novel has a significant religious thematic focus. The novel explores assumptions about individual and Native American ownership of property, a continuation of issues that some of Cooper's other works deal with, as in the tract The American Democrat. The main character, Benjamin Boden, is compared symbolically to the bees which he tends through nicknames like \\"Buzzing Ben\\" and the French term le Bourdon (\\"the drone\\"), which shows him as an industrious laborer.

The Ospreys were led by seventh-year head coach Matthew Driscoll and played their home games at UNF Arena on the university's campus in Jacksonville, Florida as members of the Atlantic Sun Conference (A-Sun). For the second year in a row, the Ospreys won the A-Sun regular season championship. They finished the season 22‚Äì12, 10‚Äì4 in A-Sun play. Guard Dallas Moore was named A-Sun Player of the Year, the first such award for a North Florida player. Driscoll and his staff were named A-Sun Coaching Staff of the Year for the second year in a row. As the No.1 seed in the Atlantic Sun Tournament, they advanced to the semifinals where they were upset at home by Florida Gulf Coast. As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, the Ospreys received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament. As a No. 7 seed, the Ospreys hosted the No. 2 seed Florida in the first round, where they fell 97‚Äì68. The Ospreys made the most three point shots (402) out of all NCAA Division I teams in the 2015‚Äì16 season, earning them the nickname \\"Birds of Trey\\".

They won the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time. As a No. 16 seed in the South Region, they were defeated 81‚Äì77 by fellow No. 16 seed Robert Morris in the First Four in Dayton, Ohio. Preseason Before the season, Driscoll agreed to a four-year contract extension to remain the team's head coach through 2022.

In a game that UNF never trailed, the Ospreys set a program record (at the time) for three-point-shots made with 17. It was the program's second victory over a Big Ten Conference opponent, with the first coming in December 2014 at Purdue. In their home opener, the Ospreys blew out Texas‚ÄìRio Grande Valley, 106‚Äì84. For the second straight game they connected on 17 three-point- shots, tying the program record. They improved to 2‚Äì0 for the first time since the 2005‚Äì06 season. It was just the third time UNF has reached 100 points since joining Division I. Guard Dallas Moore recorded his second straight double-double and became UNF's 11th player to score 1,000 career points. On November 18, coach Matthew Driscoll surpassed Matt Kilcullen to become the winningest coach in program history with a 98‚Äì69 win over crosstown rival and NAIA member Edward Waters. With the win, UNF started the season 3‚Äì0 for the first time since the 1994‚Äì95 season when they were members of Division II.

In their next game, they trailed at Dayton by only three points at halftime, but lost by a margin of 15. On December 12 against Coastal Georgia, the Ospreys scored the most points in program history with a 117‚Äì71 victory.

They snapped their losing streak by defeating NJIT at home, 107‚Äì71 on February 18. On February 20, the Ospreys clinched at least a share of the Atlantic Sun regular season title by defeating USC Upstate, 81‚Äì78.

He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and was selected as one of the Mystical Seven, a senior men's honorary. In 1942, he married Rebekah Harris Blair and had two daughters, Sarah Elizabeth Hughes and Mary Jane Hughes.  FBI Agent  Hughes practiced law in Joplin for a short period prior to World War II.

A block of four, considered the \\"crown jewel\\" of Chinese philately, was reportedly sold in 2009, together with a different stamp, for 120 million yuan (US$18.8 million).  History  An original 3¬¢ Red Revenue stamp without the overprint In January 1896, Censor Chen Pi of the Qing government petitioned the Guangxu Emperor to issue revenue stamps. The proof was submitted to Sir Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, for approval. Of the revenue stamps ordered from England, only a portion of the 3¬¢ stamps was printed and shipped to China. They were stored in the Shanghai Customs Department. The 3¬¢ red revenue stamps were printed by Waterlow & Sons in London. The red symbolizes good luck and fortune in Chinese tradition. On March 20, 1896, the Qing government approved the plan to establish a national postal service, under the supervision of the Customs Department.Matthew Bennett, Inc. (2001) The \\"Sun\\" Collection of the 1897 Overprinted Red Revenue of China. New York. At the inauguration of the postal service in February 1897, the Coiling Dragon stamps ordered from Japan failed to arrive on time, hence the idling 3¬¢ red revenue stamps were overprinted to meet demand. There are five overprinted denominations: 1¬¢, 2¬¢, 4¬¢, $1 and $5. Small One Dollar There are eight different overprints (in five denominations) on Red Revenue stamps. Of the overprinted denominations, the $1 was made first. Because of complaints that the size of the overprinted Chinese characters was too small, only two panes (each with 25 stamps) were made before they were changed to larger characters. Owing to their rarity, the \\"Small One Dollar\\" stamps have become some of the most valuable stamps in the world. Only 32 are known to exist. The crown jewel of the 32 surviving \\"Small One Dollar\\" stamps is the block of four, originally owned by R. A. de Villard who took it directly from the customs where he worked. M. D.

Certain ideals challenged the state during this time coinciding with the thought that southern Ohio was a \\"white mans state\\" even though the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 under the Articles of Confederation invited the mot Ohio. During the Industrialization period whites ad blacks were pitted against each other when white workers would go on strike they companies would then replace them temporarily with black workers. This escalated tensions allowing for discrimination to not only continue but to prevail and expand exponentially, primarily with housing. During this time there were minority groups who experienced similar discrimination such as Jewish immigrants, though as they became \\"americanized\\" and economically inclined they were welcomed into the housing markets. Up until the early 1950s with the Brown v. Board of Education ruling there were very little if any laws protecting minority groups. The Federal government actually supported racial exclusion in its FHA and VA mortgage loan insurance programs for decades. FHA (Fair Housing Administration) manuals spoke of the need to avoid introduction of ‚Äúinharmonious racial groups‚Äù into all-White neighborhoods. 40's-50 Shelley. Kramer (1949) upheld the inability to enforce the covenants by the Court though continued regardless The Federal government explicitly supported racial exclusion in its FHA and VA mortgage loan insurance programs for many years. FHA manuals spoke of the need to avoid introduction of ‚Äúinharmonious racial groups‚Äù into all-White neighborhoods. Thus, there was a strong economic incentive for some real estate agents to engage in peddling or blockbusting in targeted, usually adjacent White neighborhoods. The Lee-Harvard area of Southeast Cleveland provided many classic examples of these practices with agents facilitating the move of a single Negro purchaser to a block, followed by blanketing the area with phone calls and leaflets offering to buy from edgy homeowners ‚Äúbefore it‚Äôs too late‚Äù though also probably at less than the homes were really wort 1959, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment and establishing the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. Fair housing in Ohio received a boost when a young representative, Carl B. Stokes, in 1965 pushed through Fair Housing legislation in the Ohio Legislature three years before fair housing legislation became a reality in Washington, D.C. 60-80's Unfortunately, the state of Ohio did not have an effective Fair Housing law for a number of years after the Lysyj decision of 1974 (38 O.S.2d 217, 380.0.2d 287). This Ohio Supreme Court decision pulled the teeth out of the state Fair Housing Act, and it was not until Vernon Sykes (D-Akron) introduced H.B. 5, a state Fair Housing Law, with the support of a Democratic governor, Richard F. Celeste. Ohio had a Fair Housing Law in June 1987. They developed a strong set of parallel economic and social institutions within the ghetto. Chapters of the NAACP and the Urban League were established in many Ohio cities. To this day, the Cleveland area has two real estate bodies: the Cleveland Area Board of Realtors (CABOR-now with multi-racial membership); and the Cleveland Association of Real Estate Brokers (CAREB-a mainly Black trade association). Present Causes Zoning laws are extremely restrictive in limiting the total amount of housing to be constructed in any given area. Research has shown cities and suburbs with increasingly restrictive zoning laws also have a correlation with increased segregation within those same communities and one of the leading causes for racial segregation still today Other causes encompass overall affordability and credit ratings of the borrowers looking to buy homes for the first time. This also includes the lack of enough saved for the required down payment which infers on the instability level of the buyer(s) which play a pivotal role in the overall scheme within the housing sector.

History The brewery was founded by owner / proprietor Nick Galton-Fenzi in 2007. Its establishment marked the return to Kalgoorlie of brewing for local sales after an absence of 25 years. In 1982, Bond Corporation, owned by Australian businessman Alan Bond, closed and dismantled the Kalgoorlie Brewing and Ice Company as a part of a strategic realignment of its Swan Brewery operations. Kalgoorlie, a major mining centre, had enjoyed a rich history of local beer brewing since the establishment of the city in the late 1800s, supplying beer to the large population of miners throughout the Eastern Goldfields. The loss of local brewing (and the locally produced \\"Hannans Lager\\") was much lamented by the inhabitants of the Eastern Goldfields. Following the packaging trends of the industry at the time, a cannery was installed in the brewery in January, 2017. This installation added 375 mL cans to the existing product lines of 640 mL glass bottles, 19 L kegs and 50 L Kegs. Beaten Track brewery has taps in a number of bars and clubs in Kalgoorlie and sells its bottled products at a number of outlets in Kalgoorlie and Perth.

The type species of the family is Helveticosaurus zollingeri, named by Bernhard Peyer in 1955 based on a single nearly complete specimen T 4352 collected at Cava Tre Fontane from the Anisian-Ladinian boundary of Monte San Giorgio, Switzerland. Peyer (1955) considered the species to be a very distinctive member of the order Placodontia, and thus erected Helveticosauridae as well as the superfamily Helveticosauroidea to contain it within Placodontia. Nosotti and Rieppel (2003) described Eusaurosphargis from the equivalent beds at Cava di Besano of the Besano Formation (Anisian- Ladinian boundary) of Italy. Their phylogenetic analysis recovered it as the sister taxon of Helveticosaurus, and thus it was assigned to Helveticosauridae. Based on the description in the literature available for Saurosphargis (whose holotype is lost), they considered it to also fall in the Helveticosauridae clade. The anatomy of Saurosphargis was finally clarified by comparisons with the well-preserved specimens of Sinosaurosphargis, and as a result Saurosphargis was no longer considered to be a nomen dubium, and thus could be included in a phylogenetic analysis. Li et al. (2011) found Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis to form a clade separate from that of Eusaurosphargis and Helveticosaurus, thus Saurosphargis was removed from Helveticosauridae, and placed in its own family Saurosphargidae together with Sinosaurosphargis.

Smith is Professor of Plant Genetics and Biochemistry at the University of Tasmania in Australia, and Visiting Professor in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Beijing, China.  Education and Early Life  Smith was born and raised in Luton, Bedfordshire, England. He attended Luton Grammar School and Luton Sixth Form College before becoming an Assistant Scientific Officer at Rothamsted Experimental Station in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Working at Rothamsted inspired him to embark on a career in plant sciences and he obtained university entrance qualifications through ‚Äòday-release‚Äô and evening classes at Luton College of Technology.  Career  He was awarded first class honours in Biological Sciences from the University of Leicester, then went to Indiana University USA to study for a master's degree under the supervision of Carlos Miller, the discoverer of kinetin. Smith returned to the UK to study for a PhD under the supervision of Professor R. John Ellis, at the University of Warwick during which time he conducted some of his research at the Plant Breeding Institute, in Cambridge. He was then awarded a Fellowship to carry out research at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Division of Plant Industry in Canberra, Australia. After a short period at the John Innes Institute in Norwich, he was appointed to a lectureship in the Botany Department at the University of Edinburgh. He spent 20 years in Edinburgh rising to become Head of the Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences. He served the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council as a Teaching Quality Assessor and was External Examiner at Ngee Ann Polytechnic in Singapore. Following the award of an Australian Research Council Federation Fellowship in 2004, Smith moved to the University of Western Australia and became Winthrop Professor of Plant Genomics. He was founding member of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology in 2005, and was a Chief Investigator until 2014. He also established and was Director of the Centre of Excellence for Plant Metabolomics. In 2015 he was appointed Professor of Plant Genetics and Biochemistry in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Tasmania. In 2013 and 2014 he was awarded Fellowships by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and appointed Visiting Professor in the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology in Beijing.  Research  Smith's research is directed towards understanding plant growth and development at the molecular level, and seeking ways to improve plant productivity and value. During his PhD studies Smith collaborated with John Bedbrook at the Plant Breeding Institute to clone the first cDNA encoding a plant enzyme. This enzyme is ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, abbreviated to RuBisCO, which is responsible for carbon dioxide fixation by plants. In Edinburgh in the pre-genomics era, he collaborated with Chris Leaver and cloned several key enzymes of plant metabolism, including malate synthase, isocitrate lyase and PEP carboxykinase. He conceived an idea with Anthony Trewavas of creating transgenic plants expressing the calcium- sensitive luminous jellyfish protein, aequorin, to report calcium signalling in plants. Together they obtained funding, created the plants and showed that they could report rapid calcium signalling in response to cold, fungi, touch and wind. This work predated similar research using green fluorescent protein from the same jellyfish. In 1996 Smith and his PhD student Takeshi Takaha reported the discovery of cyclic glucans containing up to 200 glucose residues, which they named cycloamylose. Cycloamylose and related cycloglucans are now used extensively in food and biotechnology industries. Further research on starch metabolism with Alison Smith and Sam Zeeman at the John Innes Centre led to the discovery of a novel pathway of starch breakdown in leaves. Smith was also instrumental in defining pathways of energy metabolism involving peroxisomes, particularly fatty acid beta-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle.  Karrikins: a new family of plant growth regulators  Smith's current and most important contribution to plant biology lies in the establishment of karrikins as a major family of naturally occurring plant growth regulators, determination of karrikin mode of action and evolution of the karrikin response. Karrikins are small organic compounds produced by bushfires. They are washed into the soil by rain and stimulate germination of dormant seeds of fire-following plants that reside in the soil seed-bank. This response to karrikins is a specific evolutionary adaption of numerous fire- following plant species, providing them with the opportunity to grow and reproduce successfully in the post-fire environment. Smith discovered that Arabidopsis thaliana can respond to karrikins under specific conditions and this provided the breakthrough required to discover their mode of action. His group was able to isolate karrikin-insensitive mutants in Arabidopsis, and the subsequent identification of the mutated genes revealed that karrikin perception and response required an alpha/beta hydrolase known as KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2) and an F-box protein known as MORE AXILARY GROWTH2 (MAX2). These discoveries revealed that karrikin signalling occurs by a similar mechanism to the signalling of chemically-related strigolactone hormones. Crucially, he established that karrikins and strigolactones are perceived independently, and elicit different responses in plants. His research has further revealed that the usual function of KAI2 is to perceive an endogenous signalling compound that is neither karrikin nor strigolactone, but is probably very similar. He proposes that duplication of an ancestral KAI2 gene in early land plants led to the evolution of two genes in seed plants one of which perceives strigoactones and the other perceives the endogenous karrikin-like compound.

Rising to a height of , the mountain sits on the border between the northern Indian state of Sikkim and Bhutan. China claims Gipmochi as the China‚ÄìIndia‚ÄìBhutan tri-junction point. Bhutan and India, however, claim that the tri-junction is 6.5 km to the north, at Batang La.  References by British India  An 1876 map depicting Sikkim, Chumbi Valley and Bhutan The Imperial Gazetteer of India states that the Dongkya range (or Chola range) that divides Sikkim from the Chumbi Valley bifurcates at Gipmochi into two great spurs, one running to the south-east and the other to the south-west. Between the two spurs lies the valley of the Dichul (Jaldhaka) river. The \\"western shoulder\\" of Gipmochi was said to contain the trijunction point of Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet. The southwest spur mentioned in the Gazetteer forms part of the boundary between Sikkim and Bhutan. The southeast spur, called the Zompelri ridge (or Jampheri ridge), currently separates the Bhutanese districts of Haa (to the north) and Samtse (to the south). The area bounded by Gipmochi and Batang La, extending about 5 km to the southeast, forms a plateau called Dolam or Doklam plateau. Some British travel maps from the 19th century (prior to official surveys) mark this plateau as \\"Gipmochi Pk\\" and show its alignment with the Sinchela pass (on the northern ridge of the plateau). Bhutan did not have a map of its lands till 1961.Manoj Joshi, Doklam, Gipmochi, Gyemochen: It‚Äôs Hard Making Cartographic Sense of a Geopolitical Quagmire, The Wire, 20 July 2017.  Chinese border claims  The Chinese claim of the trijunction point is based on the 1890 Anglo-Chinese Convention,: According to the Convention, the Dong Lang area, which is located on the Chinese side of the boundary, is indisputably Chinese territory. For long, China‚Äôs border troops have been patrolling the area and Chinese herdsmen grazing livestock there. Article I of which states: The Article mentions Gipmochi as being on Bhutan border, but no other details regarding Bhutan were given. Bhutan was not a signatory to the Convention. Further, Gipmochi is not the highest point on the Doklam plateau. Merug La, at 15,266 feet, and Sinchela, at 14,531 feet, are higher, making the Batang La‚ÄìMerug La‚ÄìSinchela line the highest watershed in the region.Srinath Raghavan, China is wrong on Sikkim-Tibet boundary, livemint, 7 August 2017. Maps of Sikkim produced by Survey of India in 1923, 1933 and 1937 show Gipmochi as the tri-junction point, However, a map from 1910 that shows the details of the Chumbi Valley and Bhutan gives Batang La as the tri-junction point.Manoj Joshi, Doklam, Gipmochi, Gyemochen: It‚Äôs Hard Making Cartographic Sense of a Geopolitical Quagmire (Map 5), The Wire, 20 July 2017. Indian sources state that the Survey of India map of 1956 and other maps since then by both Indian and Bhutanese sources have depicted the tri-junction near Batang La. On 30 June 2017, the Chinese government released a previously- published Chinese map depicting their territory extending south to Gipmochi. The 2017 border dispute between China and India likely stems from India's security concern of its Siliguri Corridor. A Chinese observation post on the mountain of Gipmochi would have a clear view of this vital corridor which is heavily fortified by Indian troops.

He played regularly at the \\"Slowboat\\" jazz club in Sapporo, which he and his wife Yasuko owned. Fukui taught and performed internationally until his death in 2016. His work has seen a spike in popularity after his death, with several reissues of his albums. Early life and career =1966‚Äì1980s= Fukui began his life in music by learning accordion at age 18. At the age of 22 he began to teach himself piano and soon moved to Tokyo. Fukui met occasionally with saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto who offered valuable encouragement and guidance to the aspiring pianist. Nonetheless, Fukui was often disheartened, feeling as though he was not making significant improvement in his playing. Six years after moving to Tokyo, in 1976, Fukui released his first album, Scenery,Year By Year: Five Essential Albums of 1976 - JAZZIZ MagazineLost In Time: A retrospective on Ryo Fukui 'Scenery'The Michigan Daily and his second album, Mellow Dream, the year after. He continued improving his skills over the following years in live performance, often appearing in a trio including Satoshi Denpo, Yoshinori Fukui (Ryo's brother), and himself. The trio would often play at the Shinjuku Pit Inn, Kichij≈çji \\"Sometime\\" jazz club and the \\"Jazz Inn Lovely\\" in Nagoya. Fukui also began to perform overseas in France and America as well as beginning to teach jazz piano to students internationally. =1990s‚Äì2015= In 1992 during his visit to America Fukui met Barry Harris, an American jazz pianist from Detroit. The two went onto become close friends with Harris becoming a mentor figure to Fukui and helped him develop his technique in bebop. In 1994, a third album, My Favourite Tune, was recorded and released featuring Fukui on solo piano playing several original works as well as renditions of songs such as \\"My Conception\\" by Sonny Clark and \\"After Hours\\" by Avery Parrish. This album was followed by In New York four years later, in trio with the drummer Leroy Williams and the bassist Lisle Arthur Atkinson. In 1995 Fukui went onto open the Slowboat jazz club which attracted many local jazz players as well as international. He would also go onto offer lessons and workshops to pass on his knowledge of music to others. Fukui's final album, A Letter From Slowboat was released in 2015‚Äîrecorded live during his time at the Slowboat jazz club. Death and legacy Fukui died on March 15, 2016 of lymphoma.

He lived for many years in South America during the time of the Spanish American wars of independence, and wrote a book about his experiences and observations. South America Stevenson is thought to have been born about 1787, but nothing is known of his early life. About 1803 he landed on the coast of Chile in the district of Araucan√≠a, which at that time was inhabited only by indigenous people; his intention was to travel through the country. On proceeding to Arauco he was detained a prisoner on the pretext that war had broken out between Spain and England. He was conveyed successively to Concepci√≥n, Callao, and Lima, where he was imprisoned for eight months. His liberty was gradually extended, and he was permitted to reside in the town and to make excursions into the adjoining provinces. In 1808 Stevenson became private secretary to , president and captain-general of Quito, where, on the outbreak of the Ecuadorian War of Independence, he joined the insurgents. In December 1810 he was appointed governor of Esmeraldas with the title of lieutenant-colonel. In 1818 Lord Cochrane came to South America and, becoming a Chilean citizen, took command of the Chilean navy in the Chilean War of Independence. Stevenson became his secretary and took part in many of his naval operations. After twenty years' residence in South America, Stevenson revisited England about 1824. Publication A Chilean farmer: an illustration from Stevenson's book While in England he published the results of his American experiences in a work entitled A Historical and Descriptive Narrative of Twenty Years' Residence in South America (London 1825). The book is of great value for the period of the Spanish American wars of independence, and he used his unique opportunities for observation to advantage. William H. Prescott made much use of the book in his History of the Conquest of Peru. Translations into French and German were published at Paris and Weimar respectively in 1826. He returned to Peru about the end of 1825. In 1827 Stevenson went to Greece where he started a potato plantation; he abandoned the enterprise the following year because of ill health. He is thought to have been alive in 1830, but the date and place of his death are not known.

She married Mrk≈°a ≈Ωarkoviƒá and inherited his realm, the Duchy of Valona, Kanina, Himare and Berat, when he died in 1414. After unsuccessful negotiations to sell her duchy to the Venetians, the Ottomans captured it in 1417. Ruƒëina fled Valona to Zeta where she was governess of Budva from 1418. In 1420, during the Second Scutari War, she surrendered Budva to the Venetians without any resistance and moved to Dubrovnik with the town's treasury in the context of the last days of Constantine II of Bulgaria.

Ruƒëina Bal≈°iƒá is female image from the South Slavic folklore of the Balkans.Narrative Themes in Bulgarian Oral-Traditional Epic and Their Medieval Rootsbugar≈°tica This phenomenon is due to many reasons, but the most understandable is that she was the last dynastic representative of a bygone era with the Ottoman Empire. Folk tales recorded by Kuzman Shapkarev in Yarlovo in the diocese of the Patriarchate of Peƒá (1346-1766). Under the Belgrade Fortress from which Via Militaris begins is a medieval church named after her ‚Äî Ru≈æica Church. CHURCH OF THE HOLY MOTHER OF GOD - RU≈ΩICA Folklore connects this female image with the medieval fortress of Stari Ras, which was Bulgarian during the First Bulgarian Empire.

In 1391 Ruƒëina married nobleman Mrk≈°a ≈Ωarkoviƒá. Their marriage was blessed by the Archbishop of Ohrid, although it was seen as noncanonical because they were close relatives. In 1397 she and her mother were given citizenship of the Republic of Ragusa.  Duchess of Valona, Kanina, Himare and Berat  After her husband's death in 1414, Ruƒëina inherited control over Valona (Vlor√´) and held it until it fell to the Ottomans in 1417. She offered Valona to the Republic of Venice in exchange for 10,000 ducats. The Venetians were interested in gaining control over Valona in order to prevent the Ottomans from controlling entrance into the Adriatic Sea. While the Venetians prolonged negotiations with Ruƒëina hoping to get a better price, the Ottomans captured Valona in June 1417.  Governess of Budva  After the Ottoman conquest of Valona, Ruƒëina had to flee, first to Corfu and then to Zeta, which was ruled by her nephew, Bal≈°a III, who entrusted her with the governorship of the coastal town of Budva in 1418. When the Venetians sent a naval squadron to the port of Budva in 1419 during the Second Scutari War, Ruƒëina surrendered the town without any resistance and fled to the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) with the town's treasury.

The article will also cover the nearby chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle. Locronan is a member of the Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (\\"The most beautiful villages of France\\") association. The village's name means the \\"hermitage of Ronan\\", from the Breton lok which means hermitage, and after the founder Saint Ronan. It has previously been known as Saint-Ren√©-du-Bois. Saint Ronan is greatly venerated in Brittany. He was an Irish Christian missionary of the 6th century who came to the region to teach Christianity. As a consequence of Saint Ronan's close association with Locronan some of his relics are kept in the parish church. Locranon is located in the Ch√¢teaulin arrondissement of Finist√®re. The parish church The parish church at Locranon The √©glise Saint-Ronan was built in the fifteenth century, building taking place between 1420 and 1424 in the reign of Jean V and finishing in 1477 in the reign of Fran√ßois II, the father of Anne de Bretagne. The church is rectangular in shape with a nave of six bays with aisles. At the southern end of the nave, two large arcades lead to the Chapelle du P√©nity where the tomb of Saint Ronan is located. Building of the Chapelle du P√©nity was started in 1485 and finished in around 1515. Inside the Saint-Ronan church there is the Rosary altarpiece, the work of the Landerneau painter and sculptor Maurice Le Roux and dating to 1668. The 1707 pulpit is the work of the carpenter Louis Bariou and the sculptor Guillaume Le Poupon, and is decorated with m√©daillons depicting scenes from the life of Saint Ronan. The baptismal fonts are carved from granite and date to the fifteenth century and the church has organs installed by Thomas Dallam in 1672. The great window in the church's chevet dedicts 17 scenes from the passion and the window's final panel carries the arms of the N√©vet family. The tomb of Saint Ronan is carved from kersantite and dates to the fifteenth century. Other statuary in the church is a sixteenth-century \\"D√©ploration du Christ\\" in polychromed kersantite, a statue of Saint Roch in polychromed granite dating to 1509, a statue of Saint Michael in granite dating to the end of the fifteenth century, and an alabaster statue of Notre-Dame de D√©livrance dating to the fifteenth century. The church also holds statues of Saint Ronan, Saint Corentin of Quimper, Saint Yves/Ivo of Kermartin, Saint Alar/Saint Eligius, Saint Apollonia, Sainte-Marguerite, Saint Maurice abb√©, Saint Anthony, Saint Christopher, Saint Eutrope, Saint Fiacre, Mary Magdalene, Sainte Barbe, the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist, Sainte Anne, Saint Louis and a piet√†. The calvary The calvary at Locranon is a simple one and stands in the church cemetery. It is 6 metres high and dates to the sixteenth century. It has marmosets carved half way up the shaft of the cross and at the top the crucifix is reversed with a depiction of the resurrected Jesus. There is also a sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary reversed with Saint Peter and John the Evangelist reversed with a bishop, these on either side of the central crucifix. The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece This was the work of the Maurice La Roux workshop in Landerneau and dates to 1668. The altarpiece with twisted columns on either side is decorated with fifteen miniature medallions telling the story of the \\"mysteries of the Rosary\\". In the centre is a statue of a crowned Virgin Mary with Saint Dominic on one side and Saint Catherine of Siena on the other. To the left is a statue of Saint Joseph and to the right Saint Joachim. In a niche at the altarpiece's base is a small sculpture of the Virgin Mary.  The chevet window with scenes from the Passion (Christianity)  This window dates to around 1480 and tells the story of the passion in a total of 17 tableau with the Marquis de Nevet depicted in the final panel. The window was a gift of Francis II the father of Anne de Bretagne. The window has a statue of John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary on either side, these in polychromed wood and dating to the seventeenth century. There is also a granite polychromed statue of Saint Ronan in the attire of s bishop to the right of the chevet window and to the left is a statue of Saint Corentin, this in polychromed wood. Saint Corentin was a contemporary of Saint Ronan who was the first bishop of Quimper and the patron saint of the diocese. The statue of Saint Roch The statue is signed on its supporting pedestal by the sculptor R.Guillimin. The statue is polychromed and carved from granite. He holds a racloir in his right hand and in his left holds a loaf of bread. An angel is at his feet and touches the racloir whilst a dog has given him the bread. The tomb of Saint Ronan In the chapelle du P√©nity is a flagstone carved in kersanton stone by the Folgo√´t atelier for the tomb of Saint Ronan. (The word kersanton is an obsolete local name from the village of Kersanton, Brittany for kersantite.) It is thought to date to between 1423 and 1433. On the flagstone is an effigy gisant of the saint in the attire of a bishop. A lion is depicted at his feet bearing five coats of arms. The flagstone is laid upon and supported by six caryatid/angels and appears to rest on their wings. Saint Ronan holds his right hand up giving a blessing and in his other hand he holds a highly ornate cross the base of which is inserted into the lion's mouth. His head lays on a cushion with an angel with closed wings reclining on each side of the cushion. The caryatids were added to the tomb at a later stage. The saint's remains are held in Quimper cathedral but some relics are held at Locranon, placed near the tomb. See also List of works of the two Folgo√´t ateliers.

The chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle This chapel dates to the fifteenth century. It contains several statues including the descente de croix mentioned below. The stained glass windows are modern and are by Alfred Manessier and date to 1985. The bell tower is of eighteenth- century vintage and the calvary and fountain date to 1698 and were dedicated to the hemp merchant J.Conan. The chapel has a limestone calvary which is 5 metres high and features two angels collecting the crucified Jesus' blood. The descent from the cross The descent from the cross at Penity There are two versions of this sixteenth-century piet√† or as it is called here \\"The descent from the cross\\" in Locranon. One is to be seen in the chapelle du P√©nity and the other in the chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle, which lies to the southwest of the village. Both compositions involve six people, and the Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle is reckoned to be a copy of that at Penity. Both use kersanton stone. The latter is still polychromed whilst the polychrome has disappeared from the former. In both sculptures Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus surround the Virgin Mary who is supported by John the Evangelist. Mary Magdalen stands to the rear. Joseph of Arimathea holds the shroud which will cover Jesus' body. In the P√©nity version, Nicodemus holds the crown of thorns but this has broken off and is missing in the Notre-Dame-de-Bonne- Nouvelle work. At Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle the Virgin Mary does not lean towards the body as at P√©nity and at P√©nity John the Evangelist supports Jesus' head. In the P√©nity piet√† Mary Magdalene wears a Medici-type costume whilst Nicodemus wears clothes that were worn in the reign of Henry II. On the front of the pedestal at P√©nity are two bas-reliefs carved from kersanton stone, these depicting the resurrected Jesus meeting with Mary Magdalene and the disciples at Emmaus.

Etymology  Ephectic comes from the Ancient Greek ·ºêœÜŒµŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (ephektikos), which itself derives from the verb ·ºêœÄŒ≠œáŒµŒπŒΩ (epechein), meaning to hold back.  Definition  Pyrrho was a Greek philosopher of Classical antiquity credited with forming the first comprehensive school of skeptical thought, now described as Pyrrhonism. The school of thought can be further divided into ephectic Pyrrhonism, aporetic Pyrrhonism or zetetic Pyrrhonism. Prior to Pyrrho, others had given the same rationale for which he is famed. Ephectic Pyrrhonism can describe either a state, attitude, or practice, with the state sometimes experienced after \\"balanc[ing] perceptions and thoughts against one another\\". It is a less aggressive form of skepticism which may occur in that sometimes \\"[s]uspension of judgment evidently just happens to the sceptic\\". Aporetic Pyrrhonism, in contrast, describes a \\"more argumentative form of scepticism, one that works more actively towards its goal\\". Aporetic skepticism may also be described as a state of perplexity. They are actively \\"engaged in refutation\\". Zetetic Pyrrhonism, differing from the two, is \\"engaged in seeking\\". While an ephectic merely suspends judgment on a matter however arriving at that point, an aporetic skeptic engages in refutation, a form of argument before either reaching an ephectic state, an aporia (impasse), continued seeking or refutation.  Criticism  Nietzsche was critical of Pyrrhonian ephectics. One benefit of practicing ephectic Pyrrhonism is that it may be a path to happiness. It has been argued \\"that Pyrrho was teaching an attitude\\" and \\"it seems clear that it was intended as a way of producing happiness ... [he was] said to have possessed the great certitude that suspension of judgment and indifference is the key to happiness.\\" On the other hand, one criticism takes the form of a joke, a sly attack on the value of ephectic Pyrrhonism by Samuel Beckett that presupposes that \\"If one may only be ephectic unawares, then not to know so proves one to be ephectic.\\" Therefore, being ephectic admits to flaws not only of \\"one's ignorance\\" but also of \\"man's palsied moral and intellectual nature\\" as well as the very \\"nature of language itself\\". Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the concept as a flaw of early philosophers, who he characterized as \\"shy little blunderer[s] and milquetoast[s] with crooked legs\\" prone to overindulging \\"his doubting drive, his negating drive, his wait-and-see ('ephectic') drive, his analytical drive, his exploring, searching, venturing drive, his comparing, balancing drive, his will to neutrality and objectivity, his will to every sine ira et studio: have we already grasped that for the longest time they all went against the first demands of morality and conscience?\\"  See also  *Epistemology *Ethical dilemma *Neutrality *Solipsism  References  Category:Pyrrhonism Category:Theories in ancient Greek philosophy Category:Skepticism Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology ","title":"Ephectics"},{"id":"47697740","text":"Tom√°s Gustavo Andrade (born Temperley, Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16 November 1996) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Argentinos Juniors on loan from River Plate.

In October 2015, the Pilipinas Legends Group became a co-owner of the team and took over the team's management. The following month, the team was acquired by SportsLegends Managers, Inc. and renamed Pilipinas MX3 Kings, through a sponsorship arrangement with DMI Medical Supply Co., Inc.

The team was renamed after the withdrawal of Pacquiao as a co-owner of the team, thus making the Pilipinas Legends / SportsLegends Group of Dick Balajadia the new majority owner. Jean Michael Alabanza was appointed as the new team manager and Chito Loyzaga was appointed as team consultant. The team's home venue is the San Juan Gymnasium. In December 2015, as part of the team overhaul, Sunday Salvacion, Jondan Salvador, Chad Alonzo, Emmerson Oreta, Adrian Celada and import Charles Mammie were released. Team manager Jean Michael Alabanza also announced that there will be a new World Import and a Filipino-American guard coming in.

Location  The Studentendorf Adlershof is located in the south- east of Berlin, in Adlershof in the district of Treptow-K√∂penick. The complex is close to the Campus Adlershof of the Humboldt University with its scientific institutes as well as to the WISTA. It was opened on October 21, 2014. The Studentendorf Adlershof is part of the efforts to establish residential living in Adlershof next to the existing Scientific Park.Adlershof wird zur Studentenhochburg (Berliner Zeitung, October 20, 2014, retrieved March 16, 2015) On an 11,000 sqm area, ten buildings as well as a garden designed by Locodrom form the Studentendorf Adlershof. In total 288 students live in the eight three-story buildings. On each floor, 13 residents share a communal area with kitchen, dining room and lounge area. The individual rooms for the residents have en-suite bathrooms and are arranged around the living space. The two four-storey buildings along the Abram-Joffe-Street offer single and double apartments. In total 386 students can live at Studentendorf Adlershof.  Architecture  Studentendorf Adlershof, View of the courtyard The architecture of the Studentendorf Adlershof is dominated by the so-called thinker-bays (Denker-Erker), which characterise each residential unit. The Denker-Erker is simultaneously a place of retreat as well as a viewpoint. Through the different orientation of the Denker-Erker, the orientation of the windows, the shades of grey of the wood panel and the coloured sunshades the pre-fabricated facade is softened. These variations make each building unique. The model for the residential and architectural concept is Germany's unique and heritage listed Studentendorf Schlachtensee in Berlin's south-west. This can be seen especially with regard to the urban character as a student village and for the community-oriented residential buildings. Studentendorf Adlershof, View of a shared space As in Schlachtensee, all communal buildings are located around a village square. At the village square the club, the rental office, the kindergarten, the gym as well as the laundrette are located.Studentendorf in Adlershof er√∂ffnet (welt.de, retrieved March 16, 2015) Two additional courtyards complete the landscape concept. The courtyards are play and adventure areas for the residents and are designed so that communication is possible even between the houses through the large windows in the living landscapes (living rooms). The Berlin-based architectural office die Zusammenarbeiter were responsible for the design. The starting point was in October 2010 when the project won the tender for the development of the area under the urban development project \\"Wohnen am Campus\\".  Financing and management  Financing partner for the Studentendorf Adlershof was the Swiss CoOpera Sammelstiftung PUK.

Developed in Amman, Jordan, FADFED has been used in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States. FADFED, translated \\"Speak it Out\\" or \\"Let it Out\\" in Arabic, was invented by Dr. Sami Hourani and introduced by the Leaders of Tomorrow organization in Amman in 2010. FADFED involves placing white sheets of paper in public spaces and inviting individuals to write on these sheets of paper their responses to a given question prompt or prompts. Researchers using FADFED categorize respondents by demographics as suits their research purposes; for instance, by age or gender. A researcher does so by establishing a color coding of markers used at a particular event. Red markers might be given to women, or green markers to those over 50 years old, as an example. FADFED generates both written and oral discussion and debate on subject topics, and thus raises awareness of often controversial or politically sensitive issues. FADFED may be accompanied by surveys that help to establish demographic data for a given opinion-gathering event. FADFED is primarily qualitative in nature, but because it attracts many responses quickly (often hundreds in one or two hours) the data produced can be assessed quantitatively as well. In some ways, FADFED resembles focus group research in that it produces open-ended responses from many people in a short amount of time. However, because all FADFED responses are given independently, there is no danger that one voice or opinion could dominate a group discussion, as there can be in focus group research. FADFED gives equal voice to all who choose to respond.

Wester was born in Arbra, Haelsingland, Sweden 23 September 1877, he studied biology at Gefleborgs Lans Folkhogskola in Bolln√§s and emigrated to the United States in 1897. Wester worked in several agricultural offices from 1897 to 1903, including leading the United States Department of Agriculture's experiment station and experimental plots for subtropical plants in Miami. He was a special agent in the USDA Bureau of Plant Industry in Miami and Washington from 1904 to 1910. He spent the remainder of his career in the Philippines, working with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture from 1911 until his death in 1932. While there he was leader of Lamao Experimental Station and an advisor to the Minister. He made several trips to Singapore, Java, and Hawaii in order to study coffee cultivation and other crops for the purpose of introducing them to the Philippines. Wester's field of interest were spermatophytes, particularly citruses.  Early Life  Peter Jansen was born in Arbra in 1877, his early education was undertaken at home until he graduated from Gefleborgs Lans Folkhogskola in 1877. He was involved in agricultural pursuits from a young age, and helped to breed and develop a better grade of wheat which his father and neighbors were growing by the time of his departure from Sweden. At the age of 20, Peter Jansen left Sweden for America, and upon entrance to the United States added the last name of Wester to his name. He spent his early career in the U.S. as a farm worker in New England and Florida and after six years was appointed, in 1904, to special agent of the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture.  Botanic Research and the USDA  For the next four years, until 1908, Wester worked on field experiments in the Subtropical Garden experimental plots in Miami, Florida. At the end of his time there, he was placed in charge of the station. Then, in 1909 he was transferred to Washington in order to take charge of studying the culture of avocados and other tropical fruits. He spent a year in Washington before he returned to Florida for a year in 1910. Wester's time in the USDA was focused on studying and improving tropical agriculture for the United States - studying plants which could be profitable within the U.S. while also looking for improvements to the culture and propagation of plants already growing in the tropical regions of the country. > \\"He assembled the first and the largest avocado collection that hitherto had > been made and has probably done more than any single man to improve and > popularize the methods of asexual propagation of this fruit.

He would continue to serve the Philippine Government until his death, aside from a brief retirement from 1925 - 1927. He was in charge of the Lamao (Bataan) Experiment Station from 1911-1917. In June 1917 Wester transferred to the Department of Mindanao and Sulu as an agricultural advisor from 1917 - 1919. During this time, Wester focused extensively on natural resources and agricultural opportunities specific to the islands he was working on. Wester spent a majority of his time not only cataloging plants that were present but also seeking plants that he felt could flourish there. In fact, Wester tried to popularize the cereal grass Job's Tears (Coix lacryma-jobi) with its Tagalog name, Adlai, without success. During this time, Wester wrote a popular bulletin, \\"Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago: Their Natural Resources and opportunities for Development.\\" From 1919 until 1922 Wester returned to his original charge at the experiment station and then in 1922 he was designated horticulturalist and continued horticultural studies and explorations until his retirement in 1925. During his time in the Philippines, Wester studied various agricultural products - from Job's Tears and coffee to mangoes, avocados, and various varieties of apples and citruses. From his retirement in 1925 until 1927 Wester returned to Florida for a time but once again returned to the Philippines in 1927 to take up his old position with the Bureau of Agriculture. Upon his return he was placed in charge of mangosteen, lychee, tea, and semi-temperate fruit projects and foreign and domestic seed and plant introduction, distribution, and exchange and assembling of data on Philippine food plants. His studies and experiments from this point were compiled into a bulletin titled \\"Food Plants of the Philippines\\". Towards the end of his life, Wester assisted with the replanting and beautification of the Malaca√±ang Palace garden and at his death was assisting with improving the grounds of the Wack Wack Club in Caloocan. After his return to the Philippines, Wester's services were requested by multiple entities, including the United States Army. Wester had a fervent interest in tropical plants and undertook numerous experiments and endeavors in hopes of providing valuable crops to the people of the Philippines. He studied various agricultural products, such as mangos, avocados, oranges, apples, and more while writing in depth bulletins on his experiments and findings. Because of his devotion and constant travel and hunting for new varieties of plants, the Philippine Bureau of Plant Industry gained a large collection of tropical fruit from all over the world - including many citrus and avocado varieties. He wrote a bulletin, \\"Plant Propagation and Fruit Culture in the Tropics\\", and based on this research was able to introduce 86 more foreign plants to the Philippines by the end of his life. Throughout his life Wester was completely dedicated to his horticultural work and experiments while also maintaining his devotion to the people of the Philippines. During his career he wrote over 120 articles, bulletins, and circulars in regards to the work he was producing. In August 1931, at the age of 54, Peter Jansen Wester passed away at Sternberg General Hospital in Manila.

First broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2015, it is the eleventh Christmas special since the show's revival in 2005. It is written by Steven Moffat and directed by Douglas Mackinnon. The episode marks the return of Alex Kingston as River Song, making her first appearance alongside Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor. This also marks the first appearance of Nardole, who would become a companion starting from the next episode. Plot On Christmas Day 5343 on the human colony of Mendorax Dellora, the Twelfth Doctor is mistaken by a servant, Nardole, for a surgeon hired by River Song to attend to her dying husband, King Hydroflax. River, who has not yet met the Doctor's present incarnation, fails to recognise him and increasingly frustrates him with her flirtations with Hydroflax. River takes the Doctor aside to discuss the operation he is supposed to be performing; the Halassi Androvar, the most valuable diamond in the universe, has become lodged in Hydroflax‚Äôs brain during a raid on the Halassi vaults and is slowly killing him. It transpires that River does not want the \\"surgeon\\" to heal Hydroflax, but to remove his entire head (killing him) so she can take the diamond. They are interrupted by Hydroflax, who has listened to their conversation. Being a cyborg, he detaches his head from his mechanical body for safety and orders it to kill them. While River defends herself, the Doctor grabs Hydroflax's head and threatens to put him in the garbage disposal, creating a stalemate and allowing Ramone, River's actual husband, to teleport her, the Doctor and Hydroflax‚Äôs head outside of the ship. Believing Nardole to have information about River, Hydroflax‚Äôs body (which operates independently) decapitates him to use his head as its own. Although the Doctor is convinced that River knows who he is, she denies it. She reveals she purposely crashed Hydroflax‚Äôs ship in their location knowing the Doctor would be in the area with his TARDIS. Being unfamiliar with his new set of regenerations, she has an incomplete set of his faces and Ramone has only been able to find the TARDIS, not its owner. River decides they will just have to borrow it instead, which she has apparently done before without the Doctor's knowledge. However, the TARDIS's safeguards prevent it from taking off when it detects that Hydroflax‚Äôs head and body, although separated, are still linked to one another. That makes the head and body both inside and outside the TARDIS. Hearing Nardole calling for help, Ramone is tricked and uploaded into Hydroflax‚Äôs body as well. A homing beacon inside Hydroflax‚Äôs head allows his body to locate the TARDIS. Using Ramone, it forces its way inside. With Hydroflax‚Äôs head and body now both inside the TARDIS, it is able to travel to the starship Harmony and Redemption, where River requests that the ma√Ætre d‚Äô, Flemming, deadlock seal the baggage hold where the TARDIS landed in order to prevent Hydroflax‚Äôs body from pursuing them further. Rather than return the diamond to the Halassi, River reveals that she intends to sell the diamond to a buyer named Scratch, who has secretly filled the meeting point with members of his own species. After receiving payment, River and the Doctor discover that Scratch and his compatriots worship King Hydroflax and are after the diamond in his honour. Despite attempts to hide the bagged head containing the diamond, they are stopped from escaping by Flemming, who was tricked into entering the baggage area by an under-duress Ramone. Flemming has promised Hydroflax‚Äôs body an even greater head ‚Äì the Doctor's ‚Äì and believes that River Song will be the perfect bait to get it. Sensing that Hydroflax's head is beyond recovery and will die imminently, Hydroflax's body destroys it, leaving only the diamond. Flemming interrogates River for the whereabouts of the Doctor, but she explains that although she loves the Doctor, they are mistaken in thinking that he loves her back. She insists that the Doctor is incapable of falling in love, that he is beyond such simple emotions, and that he doesn't care enough about her to place himself in danger whenever she's in trouble. Then, upon seeing the steady gaze and mild smirk on the Doctor's face, River realises he has been with her all along. The Doctor confirms this by whispering \\"Hello sweetie\\". Being a time traveller, River knows the ship is about to be crippled by a meteor strike, which she uses as their escape plan, taking the diamond in the process. The Doctor uses Scratch‚Äôs universal bank transfer device to overload Hydroflax‚Äôs body, before heading to the ship‚Äôs bridge. As the ship is crashing, River discovers that they are heading towards the planet Darillium ‚Äì home to the Singing Towers mentioned by the future River as the place where she spent her final night with the Doctor (\\"Forest of the Dead\\"). Realising that they cannot save the ship, they flee into the TARDIS, but the impact of the crash knocks River unconscious. Having avoided taking River to Darillium for as long as possible to delay their last date together, the Doctor decides to give in to the inevitable. After travelling to the next morning, the Doctor suggests to a man searching for survivors of the crash that he build a restaurant where they are standing, with a view of the Singing Towers, and gives him the diamond to fund its construction. Travelling forward in time once again, the Doctor books a table on the balcony for Christmas Day in four years‚Äô time. When River awakens and exits the TARDIS into the restaurant, she is told that the Doctor is waiting for her at their table. She encounters Hydroflax‚Äôs body, since salvaged and now peacefully controlled by the heads of Ramone and Nardole, working as a waiter in the restaurant. The Doctor gives River a present: the sonic screwdriver she will use in \\"Forest of the Dead\\". As the pair admire the Singing Towers, River asks whether the stories she's encountered about her and the Doctor ‚Äì that this will be their final night together ‚Äì are true. The Doctor only responds by saying, \\"Spoilers\\". He insists that there is no way to avoid the end of their times together and refuses to tell River the future. He does reveal, however, that one night on Darillium lasts for twenty-four years, giving them a long last date. As the two smile at each other, the words \\"And they both lived happily ever after\\" are displayed on-screen. =Continuity= Ramone shows pictures of the Doctor's original twelve faces, which River mentions having in order to recognise the Doctor in \\"The Time of Angels\\" (2010). River doesn't recognise the Twelfth Doctor as the Doctor because \\"he has limits\\", referring to the Time Lords' twelve-regenerations limit first mentioned in The Deadly Assassin (1976). As he reads River's diary, Flemming relates many of her adventures with the Doctor: the opening of the Pandorica (\\"The Pandorica Opens\\"), the crash of the Byzantium (first mentioned in \\"Silence in the Library\\" and shown in \\"Flesh and Stone\\"), a picnic at Asgard (\\"Silence in the Library\\"), an encounter with Jim the Fish (\\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"), and her most recent trip ‚Äì to a place called \\"Manhattan\\" (\\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\").... The Doctor tells River that \\"every Christmas is last Christmas\\", repeating what a dream-image Danny Pink tells Clara Oswald in \\"Last Christmas\\" (2014). When the Doctor argues about River's \\"marriages\\", River recounts some of the Doctor's own: Elizabeth I (first mentioned in \\"The End of Time\\" and depicted in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\"), Marilyn Monroe (\\"A Christmas Carol\\"), and Cleopatra (mentioned in \\"The Wedding of River Song\\"). Details of the Doctor's last encounter with River at the singing towers of Darillium, originally mentioned in \\"Forest of the Dead\\" (2008), are shown here. The Doctor says that he has just had a haircut and is wearing his best suit (\\"You turned up on my doorstep, with a new haircut and a suit\\"). As the towers sing, the Doctor sheds a tear (\\"The towers sang and you cried\\"), and he refuses to tell her that this is their final night together before her death (\\"You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time. My time.\\"). River mentions that the Doctor had postponed it several times, one of which was shown in the mini- episode \\"Last Night\\". The Doctor uses both of River's catchphrases ‚Äì \\"Hello, Sweetie\\" and \\"Spoilers\\". River's last line to the Doctor is \\"I hate you\\", to which the Doctor replies \\"No, you don't\\". This is banter River and the Eleventh Doctor often used, such as in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\". River is also shown as possessing a red fez, a favourite headpiece of the Eleventh Doctor. =Outside references= The Doctor says that a flow chart is required to follow his and River's timelines; when he learns she's married another man, he says \\"I think I'm going to need a bigger flow chart\\". This echoes a line from the film Jaws: \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat\\", as well as the creation by fans of Doctor Who of flow charts to depict the Doctor and River's relative timelines. One of River's other husbands the Doctor names is actor Stephen Fry.

It was released in China on August 28, 2015 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender. Plot The story is based on Hundred Regiments Offensive, a series of engagements involving CPC's Eighth Route Army under Peng Dehuai and both IJA and collaborationist Wang Jingwei forces under Hayao Tada. In Yan'an, Mao Zedong and Zhu De talks about setbacks suffered by NRA in Japanese attacks. In the IJA HQ in Peking, before beginning their advances against Soviet Union and Pacific Islands, the Chinese war must be finished first. Then the commanders are debriefed into Peng and Zuo's profiles then Yukio Kasahara enforce the Three Alls upon arriving on the train station. In Peng's position, Zuo told him that the Japanese are controlling the railways, building strongholds and relying on armor to ensnare them. He decided to act. The tactic was distributed to officers and Mao got the message through Zhu De. In the Battle of Zaoyi where NRA forces was one-sidedly slaughtered by advancing IJA, Yao Shangwu was dragged away from Zhang Zizhong, and the latter was killed. He was buried in full honors for his effort. He returned home, to find his village ravaged by Japanese Army's assault, massacring all except a mute villager, and his wife and baby killed. He was found by Liang Shan and her unit, when they go to the village. He joined the unit afterwards. Meanwhile, in Wuxing Eighth Route Army HQ, Peng formulated an offensive with Zuo Quan to counter the Japanese attempts to ensnare them. He formed 22 Regiments worth, with more joining his plan, involving paralyzing 4 Japanese-controlled rail stations, bridges, mines and factories and forcing the enemies to act. He met Shangwu and Liang's unit to congratulate, revealing that Yao was graduated to Whampoa Academy and part of Zhang's army and accepts the mute guy's horse. The campaign started by derailing, assaults upon Japanese bases and outposts. Initially, Shangwu's unit disrupt a train line and assaulted the depot in Niangziguan, suffering and inflicting casualties, but they were fooled by IJA into not touching a fake Red Cross train, the train dismounted Japanese troops and an armored train disrupts their attack, leading them to collide a train engine. The unit suffered casualties just to hold a rail switch. They are victorious in the effort. The unit was permanently honored. In the IJA's headquarters, Hayao Tada berated Commander Okazaki for his failure and took away his medal. Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-shek was listening to the broadcast in his house when Lin Sen talk to him about the history of anti-Japanese resistance of China. Mao also listens to the broadcast. Chiang later sends a commendation on the 8th Route Army. Later, Tada commands a Collaborator to Okazaki to infiltrate the CPC's depot headed by Master Feng and returns his medal. Yao's unit was charged of defending the same depot which develops a new weapon made of chili. They also sent spies upon a Japanese armory depot in Xiyingwu, disguised as supplying Collaborators. Peng also inspects several volunteers preparing clothes and explains to Zuo the importance of the offensive when 120th Division gives them telegrams. Yao's unit was charged of attacking the depot in Xiyingwu and the division was led by Zuo himself, but there are Japanese armor that serves as reinforcements and civilians as comfort women inside the depot. Another unit ambushed the armor convoy while Zuo's unit assaulted the depot. When the women were rescued, at the cost of Liu Zhu Zi, whose family hated him for being a 'traitor' and demoted from being a commander to an infantryman, they relentlessly killed all the Japanese soldiers they find. Mao took the telegram on its success. The mute man gave Peng shoes, but he gives it back. Okazaki meanwhile assaulted the Huangyadong depot in Licheng with infantry and later, air support, but retreated when the news of the counterattack of the 8th was reached him. Master Feng, as well as the Collaborator died on the assault. Peng later honors the casualties and swears revenge upon Guanjianao, a major IJA stronghold and Okazaki's HQ. Peng himself led the attack upon Panlong, Guanjianao. Casualties were rising on both sides, especially on the caves where Japanese are holed. With air support from Tada, Okazaki led the defense, Kuromon's cavalry was repulsed. The flanks were taking fire, until a squadron entered and eliminated the defenders on a side. The assault on the main peak started. Okazaki relays a message on Tada instead of Kasahara that air support must be directed to him and wears the medal he has. Liang's position was taken air strikes, but unharmed. They were charged to plant explosives under the main base. The mute man sacrificed himself while delaying the cavalry charge, Peng took the bloodied shoes. Yao was hit by airstrike, but unharmed while Liang's men are busy planting explosives. She saved Yao from an exploding bomb, knocked her unconscious. A soldier sacrificed his life while repairing the detonation cord and detonated, destroying the flanks, while Yao carries Liang to safety. The battle ends in Peng's victory, taking the mountains. months later, Peng and Zuo debriefs his men when Yao approaches Peng and told him that if not for Liang (she died of wounds), and Peng's words, he will not be encouraged. Peng told him that it's not him, but Yao's sacrifice made him. Mao made a speech praising Hundred Regiment Offensives and commanded the listeners to use this as inspiration. Near the end of the film, both CPC and NRA are mounting offensives all over China, Zuo Quan was killed in one engagement, until Japan surrenders in 1945. At Zuo's grave, he swore that until the war is over, he will not stop fighting. He completes his map, while Hayao messed his and cried.

It is a colorless liquid with a low odour and high boiling point. It is mainly used as a solvent for paints and varnishes in the chemical industry, household detergents, brewing chemicals and textile processing.  Production and Use  Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGBE) is produced by the reaction of ethylene oxide and n-butanol with an alkalic catalyst. In pesticide products, DEGBE acts as an inert ingredient as a deactivator for formulation before the crop emerges from the soil and as a stabilizer. DEGBE is also a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, and piperonyl acetate, and as a solvent in high baked enamels. Other applications of DEGBE are as a dispersant for vinyl chloride resins in organosols, a diluent for hydraulic brake fluids, and a mutual solvent for soap, oil, and water in household cleaners. The textile industry uses DEGBE as a wetting-out solution. DEGBE is also a solvent for nitrocellulose, oils, dyes, gums, soaps, and polymers. DEGBE is also used as coupling solvent in liquid cleaners, cutting fluids, and textile auxiliaries. In the printing industry, DEGBE applications include: solvent in lacquers, paints, and printing inks; high boiling point solvent to improve gloss and flow properties; and used as a solubilizer in mineral oil products.http://www.arb.ca.gov/consprod/regact/2010ra/degbe112345.pdf References Category:Glycol ethers Category:Commodity chemicals Category:Chemical synthesis ","title":"DEG monobutyl ether"},{"id":"47698150","text":"Richard Vargas (born 28 December 1994) is a male Venezuelan racewalker.

Biography  Following his studies at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, his first job was at the European Movement International. He started his career in the European institutions in 1949, when he became secretary to the General Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe Consultative Assembly, at the request of Guy Mollet, the Committee's rapporteur. He subsequently became involved in the creation of what would eventually become the European Union. In 1952, he was seconded by the Council of Europe to act as director of the secretariat of the constitutional committee of the ad hoc assembly tasked by the six member states of the European Coal and Steel Community to prepare plans for a European Political Community (EPC). Following the collapse of the EPC project, he returned to the Council of Europe: in 1954 he was appointed as Guy Mollet's chef de cabinet when Mollet was President of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. He was subsequently appointed head of Guy Mollet's private office, then Deputy Director when the socialists returned to power in France in 1956. He acted as intermediary between Matignon and Jean Monnet's Action Committee for the United States of Europe. He played an important role in the negotiations between the Six at Val Duchesse which led to the Treaty of Rome and the Euratom Treaty. Following the fall of the Mollet Government in June 1957, he returned to the European Community institutions in April 1958 when Robert Marjolin had him appointed as Executive Secretary of the Commission of the European Economic Community. Following the merger of the executives in 1967, he became Secretary-General of the European Commission, a post he occupied until 1987. He was very close to the Commission's Spokesman Beniamino Olivi and to the chefs de cabinet of the successive Presidents of the Commission (including Pascal Lamy), and he left his mark on the institution: influence of French administrative principles, use of French as vehicular language, sense of mission in the service of the Community ideal. From 1987 to 1993 he was President of the European University Institute in Florence.

The decision had arisen spontaneously following a development course by the charity Tostan. People from N'Guerigne Bambara had been on the same course and they decided to follow the other villages example on 6 November 1997. Later that month the President of Senegal spoke in support of Malicounda's initiative.

He spent months persuading other villages to join Malicounda Bambara, N'Guerigne Bambara and Keur Simbara and this led to a combined announcement at Diabougou.

Family life  According to some reports, Margaret was the illegitimate daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham.p. 19-21, Sharon Jansen, Dangerous Talk and Strange Behavior: Women and Popular Resistance to the Reforms of Henry VIII Her first husband was William Cheyne of London. At some point before 1536, Cheyne sold her to Sir John Bulmer of Wilton, and she became his mistress. This relationship seems to have been mutually affectionate, and the couple were married by 1536, after both of their former spouses had reportedly died. Because it had originated in a wife sale, the legality of her second marriage (and therefore her perceived moral character) was disputed when she later stood trial. Margaret and John Bulmer had several children together, including the mining engineer Sir Bevis Bulmer.  Role in the uprising  John Bulmer joined the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, and became one of its leaders. The extent of Margaret's involvement is unclear: Jennifer Gourlay suggests that she probably knew about the rebellion plots, although most of the evidence against her came from only a single source, the priest John Watts. In January 1537 John Bulmer was arrested; that month, Margaret gave birth to their youngest son. She was arrested after John Watts claimed that she had goaded her husband to rebel. By late April 1537, she was a prisoner at the Tower of London. The couple originally pleaded not guilty to the charge of high treason in May 1537, before changing their plea to guilty whilst the jury was considering its verdict. In her formal statement, Margaret admitted telling her husband that \\"the commons wanted a head\\". Both were sentenced to death and executed on 25 May 1537. John Bulmer was hanged and beheaded at Tyburn, whilst Margaret was burned at the stake at West Smithfield.  Significance  Margaret was not granted the same mercy as other women who managed to escape execution despite having been far more vocal supporters of the uprisings. Megan Benson suggests that this disparity stemmed from several causes: she was perceived as being of questionable moral character; she was associated with leading rebels like Robert Aske and Francis Bigod; and (if the reports of her parentage were indeed true) she was a distant relative of the king. Madeleine and Ruth Dodds argued that the authorities chose to execute Margaret in order to set an example to other rebels and sympathisers: > \\"She committed no overt act of treason; her offences were merely words and > silence.... It [her execution] was intended as an example to others. There > can be no doubt that many women were ardent supporters of the Pilgrimage.... > Lady Bulmer's execution ... was an object-lesson to husbands ... to teach > them to distrust their wives.\\" The court records contain information about the Bulmer's relationship, and therefore provide important evidence about how some early participants in English wife sales actually perceived their relationship. Jennifer Gourlay notes that \\"of all the early modem wife sales recorded, this [the Bulmer case] reveals the most information on the participants and further, evidence exists as to the nature of the sale and to the woman's attitude towards it\\". She argues that the evidence of Margret and John Bulmer's close relationship \\"highlights the potential for wife sales to be used as a means to construct an affectionate match, one which suited not only the buyer, but also the wife\\".

The charity has a small team of staff including support workers and around 70 volunteers. History Barnabus began in 1991, as founder Peter Green took to the streets of the city with a bag of sandwiches and a thermos flask, meeting the homeless and giving out food to those in need. In 2000 the Beacon Drop-In Centre was opened. The boxer Ricky Hatton became a patron for Barnabus in 2013. In 2014 Manchester nightclub Sankeys teamed up with Barnabus, donating unclaimed items from the club‚Äôs cloakroom to the charity. Beacon Drop-In Centre The Beacon Drop-In Centre is located on Bloom Street in Manchester city centre. It is open five days and five evenings, offering food, clean clothing, blankets, hot showers and dignity/toiletry packs for the homeless community. The centre receives around 600 visits per week. Visitors are able to take part in English, maths and IT classes, as well as arts and crafts and other social and community-building activities. Basic first aid is also offered two evenings a week by voluntary nurses and paramedics. Street Soccer In 2005, Barnabus and Manchester City Mission came together to establish the Street Soccer initiative, which offered homeless men a chance to get involved in organised football activities.

Embassy of the Republic of China and Taipei Representative Office in Washington D.C. tenure In 1976, Wang Yu-yuan, who was part of the staff of the North American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was assigned to the Embassy of the Republic of China in Washington D.C. as Third Secretary. Initially, he worked in the political section, but in August 1978, following the transfer to Taipei of Senior Secretary Huang Chun-qian (ÈªÉÁ¥îË¨ô), Head of General Affairs Section, Ambassador James Shen(Ê≤àÂäçËôπÔºâpromoted him to Head of the General Affairs Section. Just a few months later, on December 15, 1978, US President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would sever its diplomatic relations with the Republic of China. Wang yu-yuan, who certainly did not expect such a news, was in charge of relocating the Embassy and moving everything out of Twin Oakes(ÈõôÊ©°ÂúíAmbassador's residence). He was also responsible for what he described later on to be the \\"saddest day of his career\\": the flag-lowering ceremony in Twin Oaks on December 31 of the same year. This event marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Republic of China's representative offices in the United States. In 1983, Dr. Fredrick Chien (Èå¢Âæ©), ROC Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, was appointed ROC Representative to Washington D.C., USA. In 1984, Dr. Chien brought Wang, then Section Chief of the Department of North American of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to his Representative Office to participate in the lobbying of the U.S. Congress for the interests of ROC. He kept this position for ten years. Following Dr. Chien's departure in July 1988, Dr. Ding Mou-shih succeeded Chien as Taiwan's Representative in Washington D.C.. Wang kept working for Dr. Ding until 1994. His smooth working style seemed to be appreciated by his superiors as evidenced by the fact that his name was quoted three times by Dr. Fredrick Chien's famous book of memoir (Èå¢Âæ©ÂõûÊÜ∂ÈåÑ). The first quotation refers to the time when the ROC decided to accept the proposal of US President Ronald Reagan to provide a secret donation to Nicaragua rebels. In August 1985, the then Foreign Minister Zhu Fusong asked Wang to personally deliver an instruction to Dr. Chien, ROC Representative in Washington. (See Dr. Fredrick Chien Memoirs Volume II, page 436). The second quotation refers to the period right before ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo's historical decision to lift martial law in 1986. In the month of July, the then Vice President Lee Teng-hui' Secretary Su Zhi-chan (ËòáÂøóË™† ) asked Wang to deliver a message from Taipei to Dr. Chien, who was very doubtful about its content. However, later in September, a long- distance call from Chiang Xiaoyong (Ëî£Â≠ùÂãá), son of Chiang Ching-kuo, confirmed to Chien that Chiang Ching-kuo had decided to accept Chien's views to lift martial law in Taiwan. (See Dr. Fredrick Chien Memoirs Volume II page 362). In August 1987, the United States took under consideration the idea of co- producing frigates with Taiwan. Two US Senators from the State of Maine-George Mitchell (Democrat) and William Cohen (Republican), confided Dr. Chien through Wang their hopes that Taiwan would choose Bath Iron Works Corporation, located in the State of Maine, as future US partner of this co-production project. (See Dr. Fredrick Chien Memoirs Volume II page 492). In 1991, Dr. Ding promoted Wang, who took over Jason Yuan‚Äôs position, as Director-General of Congressional Affairs Division of ROC's representation in Washington D.C.. In this position, Wang made his greatest achievement. Thanks to the strategy devised by Dr. Ding, Wang brilliantly succeeded in a very short period of time in winning the support of a large number of both members of the U.S Senate and House for the sale of F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. The strong support and Congressional resolutions of U.S. Congress contributed to President Bush‚Äôs announcement of the sale 150 F-16 fighter planes to the Republic of China on September 2, 1992. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief of Protocol tenure In March 1994, as Chief of Protocol of the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang accompanied President Lee Teng-hui(ÊùéÁôªËºù) in his first visit to Central American countries, and South Africa. He also accompanied Vice President Lee Yuan-zu (ÊùéÂÖÉÁ∞á)to his official visit to Panama and Guatemala, travelled with Premier Lien Chan(ÈÄ£Êà∞) to the Dominican Republic and Panama; and joined Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien(Èå¢Âæ©) in his trip to the Caribbean countries. In October 1995, Wang was awarded the \\"Orden Antonio Jose de Irisarri en el grado Gran Oficial\\" medal by the President of Guatemala. On July 3, 1996, he was awarded the \\"Orden Francisco Morazan\\" medal by the President of Honduras. ROC Ambassador to the Holy See tenure On November 8, 2008, Wang Yu-yuan presented his Letters of Credence to Pope Benedict XVI as the ninth ROC Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Holy See, (the ‚ÄúVatican‚Äù), in order to take care of Catholics in mainland China and to seek dialogue with the authorities on the Chinese mainland, Vatican's bilateral relations with ROC are quite subtle. Since the beginning of 1971, the Vatican lowered the ranking of the ‚ÄúAmbassador of the Pope‚Äù or ‚ÄúApostolic Nuncio‚Äù to Charg√© d'Affaires. In addition to the consolidation of diplomatic ties and to the active promotion of substantive relations, thanks to the tireless work of Wang Yu-yuan, on May 8, 2010, the ROC Ministry of Education officially recognized the degrees issued by 23 Pontifical Universities, Academies and Institutions in Rome, thereby solving a thorny issue that lasted over several decades. The diplomas of about eight hundred members of the clergy who have studies in Pontifical institutions in the past are now recognized. On July 12, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI bestowed upon Ambassador Wang the ‚ÄúKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Pius IX‚Äù medal (Latin: A MAGNA CRVCE EQVITEM ORDINIS PIANI), the highest honor awarded to the ambassadors to the Holy See. The award ceremony was presided by the Chief of Protocol of the Holy See, Msgr. Fortunatus Nwachukwu, on behalf of the Pope. On December 2, 2011, the ROC signed the first agreement with the Holy See in a seventy-year period, it was called ‚ÄúAgreement on the Collaboration in the Field of Higher Education and on the Recognition of Studies, Qualifications, Diplomas and Degrees.‚Äù According to President Ma Ying-jeou, this agreement helps making Taiwan ‚Äúa centre of higher education for East Asia.‚Äù As a result, Catholic teaching will be part of the curricula of Catholic institutions. This agreement was the fruit of a year's work and saw the cooperation of the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, the bishops of Taiwan, Fu-Jen Pontifical University and other Catholic colleges. Msgr. Paul Russell, Vatican's Charg√© d'Affaires in Tapei, said that \\"First of all, we had to find a common view among ourselves and then we worked closely with the Ministry of Education, of the Interior [which carries the portfolio on faith communities], the Foreign Ministry. We received enormous help from Taiwan‚Äôs Ambassador to the Holy See, Larry Wang, and President Ma Ying-jeou.\\" The Agreement entered into force on December 17, 2012. On February 11, 2013, Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs announced retirement shocked the world, as a similar event last occurred 600 years earlier. The timing of Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs announcement coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday period in Taiwan. Wang Yu-yuan, without previous authorization, through negotiations and exchanging of views with the Vatican, tried for nearly a month to succeed at what was regarded as an extremely difficult task: welcoming ROC President Ma Ying-jeou to attend Pope Francis‚Äô installation ceremony. Wang finally got the Holy See to agree on his proposal. Ma Ying-jeou became the Republic of China's first President to ever attend a Pope's inauguration ceremony and the first ROC President to see the Pope. Ma Ying- jeou expressed his appreciation for Wang's effort and spoke highly of him.

The park is situated by the coast in the city center of Midtbyen, in the Latin Quarter, bounded by the streets of Kystvejen and St. Olufs Str√¶de, overlooking the Docklands and the Bay of Aarhus in the East. It is one of only two green spaces in the historic inner city, the other one being Frue Kirkeplads at the Church of Our Lady, but is one of five protected scheduled monuments. St. Oluf Cemetery is a decommissioned graveyard turned into a municipal green space, managed by the Nature and Environment department (Danish: Natur og Milj√∏) of Aarhus Municipality. The park is named after the St. Oluf Church that used to be here, itself named after the Norwegian king and saint Olaf II. St. Oluf Cemetery functions as a recreational area for locals. The cemetery has not been in use since the early 19th century, but 11 graves from the 17th and 18th centuries are still maintained in the northern section. The park is decorated with trees, bushes and crocus and the outline of the former St. Oluf Church is marked in the grassy area, with ceramic plates of red sandstone.  History  St. Oluf Church is mentioned for the first time in a letter from 14 November 1203 by bishop Peder Vognsen. The church was then located outside the ramparts of the Viking Age town, prominently situated by the coastline and isolated from other structures. In 1548, the church collapsed and the congregation was moved to the cathedral, which had been completed in 1300. In 1637, a chapel was constructed on the former site of the church and the cemetery was again in use until 1768, when the chapel was demolished. In 1897, the cemetery was given over to a local charitable organization, looking to beautify areas in the city and it was maintained as a fenced garden until 1938, when Aarhus Municipality took over responsibility. In the early 1950s, archaeological excavations revealed the former church. The cemetery was last changed in 1953, when the iron fence was removed and the church ruin was marked out with stones. On 20 September 1969, the cemetery and church ruin became a scheduled ancient monument, to be protected from any future change. In the late 17th century, the section of the cemetery along the coast was more than twice the size of the current area, suggesting that the sanctified graveyard area was quite large, but that it has since been reduced by residential developments on the side running along Mejlgade. The southern border was established in 1767 when St. Olufs Street was expanded all the way to the coast, across the southern section of the cemetery. Archaeological excavations of the church ruin and historical records, suggests that the cemetery and the coast, used to extend further east than nowadays. In the 17th century, records shows that skeletal remains were frequently washed out into the sea, but in 1624 a bulwark is mentioned in connection with a flooding. During an expansion of the nearby Cathedral School in the 1760s, stones were collected on the beaches here, contributing significantly to later erosion.

Somerset Pomona: The Cider Apples of Somerset, Dovecote Press, 2001, p.40 Description A small to medium-sized, yellow-skinned apple of round or slightly cylindrical shape, Hangdown is most easily identified by the tree's habit, which is compact, with twiggy branches that droop heavily when in full fruit. Its origin is unknown, but it was possibly first grown in the Glastonbury area of Somerset.Morgan and Richards, The New Book of Apples, Ebury, 2002, p.283 It was also widely grown in Devon, where it was often given the name \\"Pocket Apple\\". In the classification of cider apples the Hangdown is referred to as a (mild) bittersweet type, and is considered to be a 'vintage' variety, i.e. capable of making single-varietal cider. Although Hangdown is rarely present in modern commercial orchards, it was once one of the varieties recommended by the Long Ashton Research Station for cidermaking, and is still present in 'trial' orchards outside its native area. There are a number of closely related varieties, such as the \\"Improved Hangdown\\", also known as \\"Improved Horner\\" or \\"Osier\\", which was sourced by Long Ashton from the Wedmore area in around 1900.Copas (2001), p.42 Some of these varieties are likely seedlings of the original, sharing the same type of fruit and drooping habit.

At different times Bennis also worked as a grocer, a librarian and a newspaper editor. In retrospect, however, he is chiefly remembered as a prodigious book collector who bequeathed enough volumes to his native city of Limerick to form the basis of a library \\"for the free use of the citizens\\", although it would only be in 1893 that the first public library in Limerick was actually opened. Life Bennis was born in Corkamore (Clarina), Co. Limerick, in the southern part of Ireland. He was probably born in 1790, although there are also sources giving his birth year as 1793. His first work was as a grocer, but while still a young man he relocated to Liverpool in mainland Britain where, it is thought, he joined the Quakers. In 1816 he published \\"The Principles of the one Faith Professed by All Christians\\", which would be reprinted in Paris 1826. Bennis then moved to London, possibly also returning subsequently to work in Limerick, before in 1823 crossing The Channel and settling in Paris. Various further literary works followed including \\"Traveller's Pocket Diary and Student's Journal\\" and a \\"Treatise on Life Assurance\\". He is believed to have undertaken further travel, but between 1830 and 1836 he was employed in Paris as the director of a \\"Foreigners' Library\\" (\\" librairie des √©trangers\\") established in the city by the pioneering editor Martin Bossange and the industrialist-politician Antoine- Augustin Renouard. During his Paris years Bennis also took work as an insurance agent, and was at one stage employed as a librarian by the British Embassy. Meanwhile, his membership of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) lapsed, although he continued to espouse Quaker principals. He also edited \\"Galignani\\", a news journal described in several sources as \\"The Times of Paris\\". In 1854 he was honoured with the Legion of Honour, although at a detailed level sources differ over why. One version is that he saved the life of King Louis Philippe when the king was subject to an assassination attempt, while another is content to record merely that in 1848 he saved the king's life \\"during a street fracas\\". The statement that, \\"at the time of the [1848] revolution, he peacefully retook the royal flag, for which he was knighted by the king,\\" may or may not be an alternative reading of the same events. He was still living in Paris at the time of the coup d'√©tat of 1851, and lost a large amount of property in the disturbances that briefly ensued. A few years later it is reported that he came close to being burned to death when fire engulfed government bakeries at the time of the Crimean War. The incident also involved the destruction of many of his books. George Geary Bennis died in Paris in January 1866, and was buried in the city. Sources now focus on his will and estate. His nephew and executor, Edward Bennis, arrived from Lancashire in England shortly after his death, to find that his uncle's coin collection had already been stolen. Nevertheless, what remained was more than 10,000 books, and these in due course formed a substantial kernel for a public library in Limerick.

She is credited with the concept of rewilding in the promotion of tiger conservation. This ensures zoo-born tigers develop hunting and other survival skills in a controlled natural environment prior to their return to the wild. Biography Li Quan is a graduate of Beijing University, and holds a dual MBA/MA degree from the Wharton Business School and the Lauder Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. She initiated the world's first such experiment by rewilding South China tigers in collaboration with the State Forestry Administration of China at the Laohu Valley Reserve in South Africa. The concept was initially controversial, but it is now widely accepted as a viable strategy for wildlife conservation by many mainstream wildlife organizations including the World Wide Fund for Nature. Quan has founded several charities related to tiger and wildlife conservation. She is now a director of China Tiger Revival. Prior to devoting herself to wildlife conservation she was global head of licensing at the fashion house Gucci.

The most prevalent bird wintering species residing in refuge marshes include northern pintail, green-winged teal, gadwall, American wigeon, mallard, and American black duck. Large ‚Äúrafts‚Äù of black scoter and lesser scaup are commonly observed on the open waters adjacent to the refuge. Other species wintering or migrating on the refuge and surrounding waters may include blue-winged teal, ring-necked duck, northern shoveler, canvasback, ruddy duck, redhead, bufflehead, hooded merganser, and red-breasted merganser. Both migratory Canada geese and snow geese seasonally use this refuge. The species that breed on the refuge are characteristic of species that inhabit other coastal plain communities. They include warblers, nuthatches, thrashers, and blue-gray gnatcatchers. Wading birds such as the great blue heron are commonly seen by visitors. Their breeding has been documented in at least one rookery on this refuge. Bald eagles and ospreys have also historically nested on the refuge and viable nests remain. The most common winter bird species are the American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, red-winged blackbird and sparrows. Robins feed heavily on berries of red bay and greenbrier and roost in large concentrations along the ditches. Myrtle warblers use vegetated ditch banks, and forest edges. They feed heavily on wax myrtle berries. The northern harrier may be observed hunting over the marshes. Mammalian species of black bear and white- tailed deer range over the entire refuge. They are hunted on this refuge's adjacent property.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that allows the cell to respond physiologically to low concentrations of oxygen. A class of prolyl hydroxylases which act specifically on HIF has been identified; hydroxylation of HIF allows the protein to be targeted for degradation. HIF prolyl- hydroxylase has been targeted by a variety of inhibitors that aim to treat stroke, kidney disease, ischemia, anemia, and other important diseases. Clinically observed prolyl hydroxylase domain mutations, as in the case of erythrocytosis- and breast cancer-associated PHD2 mutations, affect its selectivity for its HIF substrate, which has important implication for drug design. In humans, there are three isoforms of hypoxia-inducible factor- proline dioxygenase. These are PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3. PHD2, in particular, was identified as the most important human oxygen sensors due to its slow reaction with oxygen.

It is situated in Vaassen, a town in the province of Gelderland. History The Guelderian field marshal Maarten van Rossum built the watercastle in 1543 on the ruins of an old castle. After his death it was inherited by his nephew Hendrik van Isendoorn, who also supervised the final completion. The castle remained for over 300 years in the family D'Isendoorn √† Blois. After the last van Isendoorn widow had died childless in 1881 the threat of the closure of the castle was a probability. In 1882 however it was bought by Eduard Baron van Lynden. 1905 it came into the possession of Mrs. Frida Cleve-Mollard from Berlin whose husband Richard Cleve was the last private inhabitant of the castle. After the Second World War the castle was confiscated by the Dutch government and in 1951 transferred to the \\"Foundation of Friends of Guelderian Castles\\" (Stichting Vrienden der Geldersche Kasteelen) for the symbolic price of one Dutch guilder. Between 1975 and 1981 a restoration of the castle took place, the antique furniture has been completed and it has since reopened to visitors. The castle The castle was built in the 16th century. Its shape has been preserved until today mainly unchanged. The building complex which contains many elements of the Renaissance architecture is completely surrounded by water. The floor plan is rectangular. There are almost square and covered towers at all four corners. The northeasterly one is equipped with an onion dome. On the front side facing south, another higher onion dome was built. This one significantly protrudes from the facade was. Directly above the entrance the coat of arms of Hendrik van Isendoorn and his wife Sophia Stommel are embedded in a sandstone sculpture. Above another sandstone sculpture shows Maarten van Rossum. The entrance used to be reached via a drawbridge over the moat. This was replaced by a permanent stone arch bridge. Behind the entrance on the ground floor is an elongated narrow terrace followed by a large hall. Several representative rooms can be reached from there: a hunting room (due to the bright color of the walls also called \\"the white chamber\\") and a salon on the righthand side as well as a bedroom and a dining room on the left side. The dining room is connected via a steep spiral staircase to the underlying kitchen. Some rooms are equipped with fireplaces which have framings of Delft tiles. A Boudoir is located in the north-eastern tower. A stone spiral staircase leads to the first floor. The large hall there is equipped with oil paintings of important families from Gelderland. On the eastern side wall a family tree with ancestors from Elbert van Isendoorn √† Blois and his first wife Maria Hadewig van Essen is attached. The ceiling is covered with wooden paneling and wooden planks. Another room which is connected to the hall is furnished as a library or study room, which is called the Rode Kamer (Red Room) because of its red wallpaper. On the first floor there is also a small Chapel.

Meanwhile, it has been changed into a cultural center about the history of the Cannenburgh and the Gelderland province. The former coach house on the opposite east side operates now as a restaurant under its original name 't Koetshuis. A watermill, originating from the 15th century is located northeast of the castle.

The park, consisting of forests, meadows, flower gardens, ponds, canals, cascades and avenues has been rearranged over the centuries several times. The owners were at times also active with the timber industry and fish farming. On certain areas fruit and vegetable gardens were set up for self-supply. Many trees in the park are several hundred years old and the whole area is now used as a place of relaxation for inhabitants and visitors.
