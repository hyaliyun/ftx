History Archaeological evidence of human occupation alongside the Parramatta River has been dated back 20,000 years, and is likely to date back much further (people have been dated as being present elsewhere in Australia more than 60,000 years ago - see Australian Aboriginal Prehistoric Sites). Sydney's geomorphology 20,000 years ago was very different from what it is today. In the middle of the last ice age, the Sydney coast was approximately 15 km to the east and what is now Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) was freshwater creeks and rivers. Wangal predecessors would have been living in the now-submerged coastal area. As sea levels rose to their present levels, peoples living on the coast would have been forced inland. By 1788, the Wangal people were well established there as a fishing people. The Wangal people were among the first to encounter British settlers in 1788. While the British governor Arthur Phillip sought to establish good relationships with the local people and even befriended Bennelong, a prominent Wangal person, the differences between the groups led to tensions with both sides killing and injuring members of the other. In April 1789, just over a year after the establishment of the British settlement, smallpox broke out. There is speculation as to whether the disease was released deliberately or not but in any case the result was catastrophic.  Country  Wangal people's country, Wanne, extends along the south side of Sydney Harbour, from Darling Harbour to Rose Hill The name these people gave to their country was documented by NSW Governor Arthur Phillip in 1790 as Wann and by his successor John Hunter as Wanne. Their country has been described as extending: > ...along the south side of the harbour from Long Cove (Darling Harbour) to > Rose Hill, which the local inhabitants called Parramatta. Language The Wangal people were part of the Eora ( Dharawal, Darug, Dharuk) language speaking group, who contributed to contemporary Australian English words like dingo, woomera, wallaby, wombat, and waratah. The Wangal people and their Eora neighbours, the Cadigal people, were heavily impacted by early British settlement, many dying from smallpox or being pushed from their lands by the early settlers, and ceasing to be acknowledged and known as a viable, functioning social group within twenty years or so of 1788. The Eora / Dharawal / Darug language has since been reconstructed from the many notes made of it by the original colonists, although there has been no known oral language tradition continuing over the last one hundred years.

He was endowed the nobiliary title of Marquis of the Rif in 1927. A monarchist opponent of the Second Spanish Republic, he led a coup d'etat known as la Sanjurjada in August 1932, which was easily aborted by the authorities. Initially condemned to death, the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and he was eventually amnestied in 1934 by the government of Alejandro Lerroux formed after the 1933 general election. He took part, from his self exile in Portugal, in the military plot for the 1936 coup d'etat. Following the coup, Sanjurjo, expected by some to become the commander-in-chief of the Rebel faction, was killed in an air crash on the third day of the war, when moving back to Spain. He had chosen to fly in a small, overloaded plane, because the pilot was a friend of his. Sabotage was suspected, but never proven. Early life Sanjurjo was born in Pamplona. His father, Captain Justo Sanjurjo Bonrostra, was a Carlist. His mother was Carlota Sacanell Desojo. Military career =Early career= He served in Cuba in 1896, in the Rif War (1909) in Morocco, and in the Rif War (1920), including the regaining of the territory in Melilla lost after the Battle of Annual in 1921. In 1922, he was assigned to investigate corruption in the army command of Larache. He was High Commissioner of Spain in Morocco and reached the rank of lieutenant general. In 1925 he participated in the amphibious landing at Alhucemas. With the completion of the 1920 Rif War, King Alfonso XIII awarded him the Gran Cruz de Carlos III on 28 March 1931. In 1928 he was made chief of a main directorate of the Civil Guard. =During the Second Republic= In 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera came to power in a military coup, ruling Spain as dictator.Thomas (1961). p. 16. Gradually, Primo de Rivera's support faded,Preston (2006). p. 34. and he resigned in January 1930.Preston (2006). p. 36. General Dámaso Berenguer was ordered by the king to form a replacement government,Preston (2006). p. 37. which annoyed Sanjurjo, who considered himself far better qualified.Beevor (2006). p. 18. Berenguer's dictablanda dictatorship failed to provide a viable alternative to Primo de Rivera. In the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, little support was shown for pro-monarchy parties in the major cities, and large numbers of people gathered in the streets of Madrid.Thomas (1961). pp. 18–19. Asked if the government could count on the support of Sanjurjo's Civil Guard, he rejected the suggestion.Beevor (2006). p. 19. King Alfonso XIII abdicated, and the Second Spanish Republic was formed. Despite Azaña's military reforms of 1931, Sanjurjo retained his post as the commander of the Civil Guard; under his command they continued to use their traditionally brutal tactics such as the \\"ley de fugas\\", the excuse of shooting prisoners and later claiming that they were attempting to escape during an incident of unrest in Seville.Beevor (2006) p. 2 Sanjurjo became one of the first generals appointed to the command of the Spanish Republican Army. His sympathies, however, remained with the monarchist cause.Paul Preston. The coming of the Spanish Civil War: reform, reaction, and revolution in the Second Republic. 2nd ed. Routledge, 1994. Pp. 51. When he clashed with Prime Minister Manuel Azaña over the military reforms, he was replaced by General Miguel Cabanellas. He was demoted to chief of the customs officers in 1932 as a result of the events of Castilblanco and Arnedo involving the Civil Guard. His confrontation with the ministry, Azaña's military reforms, and the grants of regional autonomy to Catalonia and the Basque Country, led Sanjurjo to plot a rebellion with some Carlists under Manuel Fal Conde, Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, and other military officers. This rebellion, which was known as the Sanjurjada, was proclaimed in Seville on 10 August 1932.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. 2001. pp.95-97 Sanjurjo asserted that the rebellion was only against the current ministry and not against the Republic. It achieved initial success in Seville but absolute failure in Madrid. Sanjurjo attempted to flee to Portugal, but in Huelva he decided to give himself up. He was condemned to death, a sentence which was later commuted to life imprisonment in the penitentiary of the Dueso. In March 1934 he was granted amnesty by the Lerroux government and went into exile in Estoril, Portugal. =Coup= When Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was replaced as President of the Republic by Azaña on 10 May 1936, Sanjurjo joined with Generals Emilio Mola, Francisco Franco and Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in a plot to overthrow the republican government. This led to the Nationalist uprising on 17 July 1936, which started the Spanish Civil War. Determined to annihilate the Spanish Republic, when he was asked to become the leader of the rebellion by envoy Luis Bolín on 12 July 1936, Sanjurjo declared: Death On 20 July 1936, Sanjurjo was killed in Estoril in a plane crash, when he tried to fly back to Spain. He chose to fly in a small biplane aircraft piloted by Juan Antonio Ansaldo. One of the main reasons for the crash was the heavy luggage that Sanjurjo insisted on bringing. Ansaldo had warned him that the load was too heavy, but Sanjurjo answered back: > \\"I need to wear proper clothes as the new caudillo of Spain.\\" Unaccountably, Sanjurjo chose to fly in Ansaldo's plane rather than a much larger and more suitable airplane that was available. The larger plane was an 8-passenger de Havilland Dragon Rapide, the same one which had transported Franco from the Canary Islands to Morocco. Sanjurjo, however, apparently preferred the drama of flying with a \\"daring aviator\\" such as Ansaldo (who himself survived the crash).Stanley G. Payne, Politics and the Military in Modern Spain, 1967, p. 352 When Mola also died in an aircraft accident, Franco was left as the sole effective leader of the Nationalist cause. This led to rumors that Franco had arranged the deaths of his two rivals, but no evidence has ever been produced to support that allegation.Jose Sanjurjo at www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk In 2017 the Historical Memory Law was applied by the authorities of Navarre and required that the Sanjurjo's remains be disinterred, over the objections of surviving family, and reburied in the military section of a municipal cemetery in the Spanish city of Melilla—an enclave on the coast of Morocco where Sanjurjo had once been in command. Further controversy ensued when Sanjurjo was buried with military honors in a military Pantheon of Heroes, as confirmed by the army. The government of Navarre received assurances from the Ministry of Defense that special \\"honors were not offered\\" and that the remains were received as \\"just one more soldier\\".  In fiction  The opening of the alternate history novel by Harry Turtledove, Hitler's War, in his series The War That Came Early, begins with Sanjurjo's flight from Portugal. The point of divergence is that he accepts the pilot's advice and abandons the luggage so the flight is not overloaded and thus arrives safely. His behavior from then on is described as diverging from that of the actual Franco, with Spain taking a less isolated role in World War II and joining the Axis Powers. José Sanjurjo, the beginnings of the Spanish Civil War, and his ill-fated flight are discussed in José Saramago's book The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.

Like the album Into the Unknown, this album is a massive departure for Graffin, whose songs generally revolve around loud guitars and harmonies. American Lesion for the most part features Graffin's voice alone, and each song features acoustic guitar or piano rather than electric guitars. The song \\"Cease\\" (track 6 on this album) is a slow piano ballad that is also featured on Bad Religion's album The Gray Race as a fast-paced punk rock song. The lyrical content can also be seen as a departure for Graffin. In most Bad Religion songs, he deals with subjects such as mass globalisation or world pollution. The songs on American Lesion are much more personal; the songs were apparently written about the breakup of his marriage, making the album poignant.

The chain offers optician services for eyesight testing and sells glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses. It also sells hearing aids. In the United Kingdom in 2012 it had the largest single market share of the four major opticians, with 42% of the market. The company had a total turnover of 2.78 billion in 2018/2019 with 2,111 branches in the United Kingdom, Guernsey, Jersey, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. History and market position A branch of Specsavers in the Horsefair Centre in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. The group was launched in 1984, by husband and wife team Doug Perkins and Mary Perkins on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. As well as stores in the United Kingdom, they are present in Ireland, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. The company ventured into hearing services in 2002. Their Hearing Centres division provides hearing tests and hearing aids within the Specsavers optical stores providing services, from more than four hundred locations. Specsavers also sell optical collections by Jeff Banks, Timberland, Hackett London and Quiksilver for men, Converse and Tommy Hilfiger for men and women, and Roxy, Love Moschino, Cath Kidston and Karen Millen for women plus a new range from Kylie Minogue launched in 2017. The co- founder of Specsavers, Mary Perkins, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2007, in recognition of her services to business and the community in Guernsey. In April 2004, Specsavers acquired Swedish Blic Optik franchise from its owner Optimum Optik AB. In 2007, finance director John Perkins became joint managing director, with his father Doug Perkins. In The Sunday Times Rich List 2011, published in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2011, Douglas and Dame Mary Perkins and family were ranked 56th in the list of Britain's Wealthiest People. Their personal worth was estimated at £1.150 billion, with Dame Mary becoming Britain's first self made female billionaire. Advertising campaigns In February 2007, Specsavers was ranked No. 46 of the United Kingdom's 100 Heaviest Spenders on TV Advertising, spending £27 million. Specsavers' long running advertising campaign is based on the popular strapline \\"Should've gone to Specsavers\\". A common theme of these adverts is a character making a mistake because of poor eyesight. These include a sheep farmer who shears his sheepdog and an elderly couple who mistake the seats of a rollercoaster for a park bench. Specsavers' use of Édith Piaf in advertisements has caused some adverse comment in the press, although the estate of the performer had granted full permission. Other Specsavers adverts have featured Thunderbirds, Postman Pat, Mr. MenSpecsavers enlists the Mr Men for 'should've gone' drive and John Cleese as Basil Fawlty. In 2015, Specsavers have maintained a large focus on promoting online contact lens sales. Online purchasing can be done through their website, which features many popular contact lens brands such as Johnson and Johnson brand lenses. For many of these brands, Specsavers also offers their own-brand equivalent Easyvision. In 2017, Specsavers officially launched a range of eyewear designed by the popstar, singer and actress Kylie Minogue.  Criticism of internet retailers  In March 2005, Specsavers publicly criticised Glasses Direct, an internet retailer, claiming that an internet service \\"did not meet required standards\\" and \\"could not offer advice from dispensing opticians\\". In 2006, James Murray Wells, the managing director of Glasses Direct, claimed that four major high street retailers including Specsavers were \\"leading a campaign to stop prescription glasses being sold over the internet\\". Structure The firm operates most of their stores under a 'Joint or Shared Venture Partnership', consisting of a partnership between an Optometry Director and a Retail Director. This is similar to a franchise agreement; however, unlike many franchises, a customer from one branch of the company should expect to get equal service from another branch. It also differs in that Specsavers own shares in the franchisee business rather than just providing goods and services under a franchise agreement. In other territories such as Sweden, Norway and Spain, they operate a normal franchise agreement. The company took advantage of the development of the Any Qualified Provider initiative in the English National Health Service from 2009 to expand into the hearing aid business. In May 2020, Specsavers set up a video consultation service for the first time, to check people's eyes and hearing aids during the COVID-19 outbreak. Business strategy and future The Perkins have stated that they intend to maintain family control of the firm, which currently employs all three of their children in senior roles. Continued expansion into Europe is planned. It is also intended that the company will continue to supply hearing aids. The Perkins attribute their success to their franchise model, and to the deregulation of the UK Opticians market by the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, allowing opticians to use previously forbidden advertising and marketing techniques to rapidly take over a market that had belonged to independent local opticians. The Perkins have said of the remaining local opticians that \\"their days are numbered\\", and in fact their major competition now comes from large chains such as Boots The Chemist and Vision Express. In February 2016, it was announced that Specsavers would be the sponsors of the County Championship cricket competition in England and Wales, for the next four years; a deal which was extended in 2018 to include Test series held in England including the 2019 Ashes series. In January 2017, Specsavers were in negotiation to have shops undertake certain front line medical care linked to sight and hearing, in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In May 2020, Specsavers announced a plan to cut 450 jobs amid a \\"dramatic downturn\\" caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. The company had previously tried to avoid making redundancies by implementing pay cuts and reducing working hours.

In his early career, Hart appeared mostly in westerns. Although Hart played mostly minor roles in some fairly well known films, he was probably best known for having replaced Clayton Moore in the television series The Lone Ranger for one season (1952–53). Career Hart began his screen career in 1937 with a bit part in Daughter of Shanghai. He continued in a variety of B pictures such as Prison Farm and King of Alcatraz before appearing in two of Cecil B. DeMille's films The Buccaneer (1938) and North West Mounted Police (1940). In 1941, Hart's acting career was interrupted when he was drafted into the United States Army. He rose to the rank of first sergeant in the Coast Artillery and eventually served in the Philippines. Following his military service, Hart worked frequently for Sam Katzman; he was given the lead role in the Jack Armstrong (1947) film serial. Hart did stunt work and acted in numerous westerns. Hart was eventually offered the opportunity to replace Clayton Moore on The Lone Ranger television series. Based on the assumption that the masked character, rather than the actor, was the true star of The Lone Ranger, the program's producers fired Moore (presumably over salary differences) and replaced him with Hart, who was of a similar build and had a comparable background in Westerns. However, the public never truly accepted Hart as the Lone Ranger, and by 1954 the producers returned Moore to the role. According to Clayton Moore's autobiography I Was That Masked Man, Moore never knew why he was replaced by Hart, and also stated that he had not sought a pay increase. Hart acted in minor roles in two episodes of The Lone Ranger before being asked to replace Clayton Moore for the entire third season. The episodes were \\"Rifles and Renegades\\" (#34) and \\"Sheriff at Gunstock\\" (#46). Hart continued to act in films for more than two decades, appearing in films of several genres, almost always in supporting roles. Hart appeared twice in on the TV series I Love Lucy as Lucy's old boyfriend and again in the Hollywood episodes as a lifeguard at the hotel pool. In 1955, Hart starred in The Adventures of Captain Africa, which was originally intended to be a new movie about famous comic book hero The Phantom. However, licensing issues forced Columbia Pictures re-film the entire serial and re-christen the hero \\"Captain Africa.\\" Hart also had numerous supporting roles in the Highway Patrol TV series. In 1957, Hart portrayed Nat \\"Hawkeye\\" Cutler in the syndicated western series Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans,. The one-season program was based loosely on the novels of James Fenimore Cooper. It was filmed in Canada and featured some Indians in a favorable image. Interviewed by Tom Weaver in \\"Western Clippings\\" magazine (May–June 2000), Hart revealed that he met actress Beryl Braithwaite when she played a role in an episode of the series; they married just days later, with \\"Hawkeye\\" co-star Lon Chaney, Jr., the best man at the wedding. In 1965 Hart made two brief appearances on the TV series Perry Mason, including the role of title character and murder victim Jamison Selff in \\"The Case of the Wrathful Wraith.\\" In the 1970 film The Phynx, Hart played the Lone Ranger alongside Jay Silverheels as Tonto, spoofing their characters. Hart's last theatrical film appearance was in 1981's The Legend of the Lone Ranger in which he appeared as a newspaper editor. He appeared in the television series Happy Days as the Lone Ranger in the episode \\"Hi Yo, Fonzie Away\\" (February 9, 1982). In this episode Fonzie, played by Henry Winkler gets to meet his childhood hero, the Lone Ranger, for his birthday. Hart's other major late appearance was in an episode of The Greatest American Hero, My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, where Hart gives the title character an inspiring speech about heroism. Personal life and death Born in Los Angeles, Hart's mother was named Enid and he had a sister, Shari. Hart attended South Pasadena High School and later studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. He and his wife Beryl had a son, Buddy, and a daughter, Robyn. On September 20, 2009, Hart died from complications of dementia at his home in Playas de Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico at the age of 91. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

Plot summary The story relates a disabled former astronaut's account of the terrifying change he undergoes after being exposed to an extraterrestrial mutagen, during a space mission to Venus (similar to the canceled Manned Venus Flyby, but using a \\"Saturn 16\\" rocket). Arthur, the narrator, begins the story with his hands bandaged, and complains of a terrible itching both after the mission and currently. The change takes the form of numerous tiny eyeballs which break out on his fingertips. These eyeballs act as the titular \\"doorway\\" for an alien species, allowing them to see into our world, but, seeing from an alien perspective, they view humans as horrifying monstrosities which, Arthur perceives, they fear and hate intensely. Soon, the alien presence is not only able to see through this doorway, but take control of Arthur's shattered body, using him to commit terrible murders. In a desperate attempt to maintain his humanity, Arthur douses his hands in kerosene and sets them on fire, only to find out that once the doorway has opened, it cannot be so easily closed. He manages to make the alien presence go away for nearly seven years. But after the eyes reappear on Arthur's chest, he reveals that he plans to kill himself with a shotgun to prevent the aliens from committing any more atrocities. Film adaptation In 2009, the Czech director Robin Kašpařík obtained rights from King to adapt his short story into a non-profit short film. The film, Jsem brána (I Am the Doorway), was shot using the fulldome technology. The story was finally adapted as a short filmhttp://www.iamthedoorway.com by Robin Kašpařík in 2017https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4522960/. The film was shot in a first-person viewpoint, with the main character played by mime Radim Vizváry. In 2015, British director Matthew J. Rowney produced the short story via the dollar baby campaign. The adaptation currently has the most international awards attached to a Dollar Baby movie.

After early success as an actor in the plays of George Bernard Shaw, he increasingly turned to directing and was a major figure in British theatre in the Edwardian and inter-war periods. As a writer his plays, which tackled difficult and controversial subject matter, met with a mixed reception during his lifetime but have continued to receive attention. Biography =Early life and acting career= Harley Granville-Barker was born in London, England on 25 November 1877. He left school at 14 and began a career in acting. As his career blossomed, he seemed to excel in roles that were a culmination of intelligence and romantic dreaminess. This landed him many roles such as; Tanner in Man and Superman, Cusins in Major Barbara, Marchbanks in Candida, and Dubedat in The Doctor's Dilemma. To be more specific the Dubedat and Cusins characters were written by George Bernard Shaw with Granville-Barker specifically in mind. However, performing no longer appealed to Granville- Barker so he gave it up in 1911. =Directing career= With an interest in theatre still at heart, he decided to focus on directing. During this time directing was not a focus point in English theatre, but he used the building blocks of Antoine and Reinhardt to his advantage and contributed to changing the dynamics of production in English theatre. Some of his first assignments were with the Stage Society, but it wasn't until 1904 when he worked with the Royal Court Theatre that his directing career took off. From 1904 to 1907 he was considered to be one of the major reformers of the Edwardian Stage. While working with the Royal Court, he collaborated with J.E. Vedrenne to mount almost 1,000 performances. Many of these performances were classics while some were new works. Among the new pieces of work, were eleven plays written by George Bernard Shaw. Granville-Barker often worked with Shaw to assist in staging his plays and directing them as well. As the Vedrenne-Barker seasons closed with the Royal Court, new opportunities opened with the Duke of York's Theatre in 1910. This new opportunity reminded Granville-Barker of the need for more repertory companies. In 1904 he collaborated with William Archer to write a book that argued for a national theatre; unfortunately, it was a lost cause that became one of the biggest disappointments in his life. However, his efforts did not go to waste but added to the growth of the regional repertory movement in Britain. Granville-Barker's directing career boomed with three famous productions of Shakespeare at the Savoy Theatre: The Winter's Tale and Twelfth Night during 1912 and A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1914. Granville- Barker took these productions and removed all classic scenery and replaced it with symbolic scenery, as well as enforcing ensemble acting. =Writing career= Harley Granville-Barker circa 1915 The year before he met his first wife, Granville-Barker wrote The Voysey Inheritance which is considered to be a masterpiece of the Edwardian stage. However, his other plays did not sit well with the Edwardian audience. They found his plays to be incomprehensible. According to The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance, his style was more similar to the styles of Chekhov by putting the \\"action under the surface\\". Although his audience may not have understood him, this did not stop Granville-Barker from discussing important issues in society. In 1907 Granville-Barker's play Waste was banned due to the topic of abortion and its politics. In 1909, three volumes of his plays, The Voysey Inheritance, Waste, and The Marrying of Ann Leete, were published in a limited edition of 50 copies printed on handmade paper in a slipcase. Granville-Barker's most notable prose work is the Prefaces to Shakespeare written from 1927 to the end of his life in 1946. Prefaces to Shakespeare was considered the first major Shakespeare study to attend to the practical matters of staging. The prefaces were published in two hardback volumes in 1946 and 1947. =Personal life= In 1906, Granville-Barker met his first wife Lillah McCarthy while playing her opposite in Man and Superman. After World War I, he divorced McCarthy and married an American writer named Helen Huntington who disliked the stage, actors, and especially Shaw. He then hyphenated his name, causing his colleagues to believe that he was abandoning the battle for a life of luxury. He later settled in Paris where he collaborated with Huntington on translating the comedies of Martínez Sierra and the Álvarez Quintero brothers. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Granville-Barker fled France for Spain before moving to the United States. In America he lectured at Harvard and was also employed by British Information Services. At the end of the war he returned to France and died in Paris on 31 August 1946. Sympathetic to left- wing causes, he had declined a knighthood. Bibliography *Plays by Harley Granville Barker (The Marrying of Ann Leete, The Voysey Inheritance, The Kyle and Waste), ed.

He developed a highly successful technique, specialising in knee and other damaged joints both in the top sportsmen and the general public. He advocated the avoidance of surgery. However, his methods were never formally approved by the medical establishment. Because of opposition towards a Lambeth degree or honorary degree for him, he was instead honored with a knighthood in 1922, nominally for services in World War I. In the 1920s he visited Doctor's Cave Beach Club in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and was most impressed by the curative powers of the waters. His subsequent articles about the beach lead to it becoming a popular destination for those seeking cures, and this was the start of the tourist industry in Montego Bay.

It is modeled after the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It is the first known tubular steel continuous-track roller coaster. Located on the border between Tomorrowland and Fantasyland, it employs forced perspective to seem larger. History =1956–1970= During the construction of the park, dirt from the excavation of Sleeping Beauty Castle's moat was piled in an area between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. When the park opened, the area, dubbed Holiday Hill (and later Lookout Mountain), was improved with benches and pathways to encourage its use as a picnic area. After the opening of the Disneyland Skyway in 1956, Walt Disney conceived the idea of a toboggan ride on the mountain with real snow, but the logistics caused vehement objections by Disneyland construction chief Joe Fowler. In this period, the hill began to be known as Snow Hill. By now, instead of being a place for picnicking, the hill had come to be used primarily as a nighttime lovers' lane, much to Disney's dismay. New wild mouse-style roller coasters got the attention of Disneyland executives, who began to consider applying this emerging technology to the creation of a toboggan-themed coaster ride on an artificial mountain at the site. The Matterhorn Bobsleds have a striking resemblance to \\"one of the oldest rollercoasters in the world, Rutschebanen, also known as Bjergbanen (the Mountain Coaster, which opened in 1914 and still operates with a rider on each train braking the car on each hill).\\" Similar to Rutschebanen, which predated it by nearly half a century, the top of the Matterhorn Bobsleds ride is also an icy scene, and the snowbirds and the interior featuring the Abominable Snowman are also quite similar in design.http://mykeandteriphotography.com/tivoli-gardens-the-original- disneyland/ 1962 from Fantasyland side. The Matterhorn hid the central Skyway cable pylon. Waterfalls are visible on the left and right sides. The structure was also intended to act as a decorative overlay to camouflage the central pylon of the Skyway. Use of the Matterhorn, both in style and name, grew from Walt Disney's extended vacation in Switzerland while filming Third Man on the Mountain. In a moment of inspiration, impressed by the beauty of the real Matterhorn, Walt grabbed a postcard of the mountain from a souvenir stand and sent it back to Imagineer (architect) Vic Greene with the message, \\"Vic. Build This. Walt.\\" This resulted in the merger of the toboggan-ride concept with the idea for a bobsled coaster ride that would run around and through the structure. The peak was first shown in a conceptual drawing that was once on display at the Disney Gallery. The view to the northwest shows a corner of the now-defunct Junior Autopia, which would be replaced by both the Matterhorn and the Submarine Voyage attraction the following year. As one of three major new Tomorrowland attractions to open that year, the Matterhorn debuted on June 14, 1959. Built by coaster builder Arrow Development and WED Imagineering, it was the first tubular steel roller coaster in the world. It consisted of a wood and steel infrastructure surrounded by man-made rock. Starting with the 1961 holiday season, a revolving star stood atop the Matterhorn. Trees could be seen on its sides; by making the trees at higher altitudes smaller, the Imagineers used forced perspective to augment the mountain's height. Waterfalls cascaded down its sides and frequently sprayed riders. Inside was a large, open space through which the bobsleds traveled. The peak had numerous holes in its exterior through which the bobsleds exited and re-entered, though the space within was not elaborately themed, with the infrastructure only minimally disguised as rock. The Skyway passed through the center of the mountain via a pair of holes on the Fantasyland and Tomorrowland sides. Skyway riders could see down into the Matterhorn's interior as they glided through. =1970s= In the early 1970s, the ride was officially made a part of Fantasyland, but this was merely a prelude to far more significant changes. In 1973, the revolving star at the top of the Matterhorn was removed, in part because of the 1973 oil crisis that had hit the US. In 1978, the Matterhorn received a major refurbishment. Most notably, the hollow interior space was broken up into a number of small, icy caves and tunnels with far more convincing theming. Some holes in the mountain's skin were filled in as well, including the two large openings at the top of the lift hill that had allowed guests to briefly glimpse the entire southern part of the park. Another major addition was an Abominable Snowman that had taken residence in the mountain and was affectionately named Harold by the Imagineers.https://www.ocregister.com/2015/07/16/video-see-disneylands-bigger- scarier-abominable-snowman-on-the-matterhorn-2/ The creature exists as three similar Audio-Animatronic figures that roar at the bobsledders; the first is visible from both tracks at the point at which they divide to take separate paths, while the other two are visible only from their respective tracks. Each track also features a pair of red eyes that glow in the dark shortly after the lift hill while its roar is heard. These roars can be heard from ground level as well, even over the recorded howling of the Alpine wind. The bobsleds themselves were also changed from the original flat, luge-like, multi-colored two-seaters to the rounder, white cars decorated with orange and red stripes. The bobsleds also changed from a single car to two cars connected to one another to form a \\"train\\". =1990s–present= The Skyway continued to travel through the mountain, but its passageway was now enclosed in similarly themed ice caves. Following the closure of the Skyway in 1994, the cavernous holes through which the Skyway buckets had traveled were partially filled in. The holes in the Tomorrowland face remained mostly intact, and a grotto filled with glimmering crystals was installed nearby. An abandoned crate labeled \\"Wells Expedition\\" was also added as a tribute to Frank Wells, who had died earlier that year.https://www.ocregister.com/2017/03/31/matterhorn-wells- expedition/ Wells had completed six of the Seven Summits, with only Mount Everest remaining at the time of his death. The bluish glow of the crystals could be easily seen from the ground at night. With the exception of the filling of certain holes, the actual external structure of the mountain remained largely unchanged from its original construction. The Matterhorn temporarily closed on January 9, 2012 for a six-month refurbishment. The mountain was renovated, receiving new paint externally and some repairs internally. The vehicle seating arrangement was also modified to accommodate a single passenger in each seat rather than a lap-sitting arrangement of two riders. This resulted in three individual seats within each bobsled, with two cars linked together for a total of six guests, similar to the configuration of the trains at Walt Disney World's version of Space Mountain. The new bobsleds were painted red, blue, and green, and the ride reopened on June 15, 2012. As a result of the new trains, the height requirement has since raised to 42 in (107 cm) from the original 35 in (89 cm). Part of the rehab included giving the entire mountain exterior a facelift. For only the second time, the first since when the attraction was originally built, scaffolding was erected all the way from the base of the mountain to the top. The mountain had been painted repeatedly through the years, resulting in a mostly white Matterhorn mountain with the appearance of snow, but in 2012, the entire mountain was made bare again and was carefully painted in a style more realistic to the look of the real Matterhorn. This meant placing more \\"snow\\" on the northern side and less of it on the southern side of the mountain. For the first time since the Matterhorn's early days, the base of the mountain was mostly snowless. The \\"snow\\" on the mountain's surface in the past was merely white paint, but for the refurbished ride, glass beads were mixed into the paint so that the snow would reflect sunlight as does actual snow. Imagineer Jim Crouch served as a field art director over the rehab project. The mountain climbers also returned after the refurbishment. On January 5, 2015, the attraction was closed for an extended refurbishment to prepare for the park's 60th anniversary. It reopened on May 22, 2015, with new special effects and updated animatronics. On the lift hills, a projected image of the Abominable Snowman is visible through a sheet of ice. A newer animatronic version of the Snowman appears at the top, while improved sound effects help create the illusion that it is in pursuit as the train descends down the mountain. Disney's FastPass ride system was added to the roller coaster in April 2017. The Matterhorn once again closed on July 30, 2018 for another renovation, this time redesigning the waiting queue. The ride reopened on November 16, 2018 with a new queue area. The front of the old Matterhorn entrance was reworked to accommodate a larger queue area.

The attraction The ride consists of two separate tracks that run roughly parallel to each other for much of the ride, intertwining and eventually deviating from each other at the loading areas. They are the Fantasyland track and Tomorrowland track, named for the side of the mountains where their loading lines begin. The vehicles originally held up to four passengers each, seated single-file. After the 1978 upgrade, the individual vehicles were joined into pairs, with lap seating increasing the capacity per train to eight. In 2012, the cars were replaced with new vehicles as part of a six-month ride closure, and it currently features two cars paired together with three single-file seats per car. The safety restraints consist of a car seat belt. There are hand grips inside the cars, but there are no longer hand grips on the outside of the bobsled. There is one lift hill on each track. Bobsleds ascend parallel to each other at the start of the ride, climbing past walls featuring snow-like special effects. The top of this lift hill constitutes the highest point of the ride itself, though the mountain continues upward for several more stories. The rest of the ride is a mostly unpowered coast through the Matterhorn's many caverns and passageways. The splash-down pools at the end of each track serve dual purposes. They not only cool off the braking pads mounted on the underside of the bobsleds, but the impact into the water itself acts as a braking mechanism. Because of their constant exposure to water, the fiberglass bodies are regularly waxed. For many years, a basketball half-court existed inside the structure above the coaster, near the top of the mountain, where the mountain climbers could play between climbs. As internal access to the mountain was locked for safety reasons, the court was accessible only to the climbers. The court was relocated slightly during the installation of the Tinkerbell flight equipment prior to the 50th-anniversary celebration; the hoop and playing area remain intact. There is a cast member break room inside the mountain at the base. The court is said by many cast members and the mountain's climbers to remain in existence today. At the end of the attraction, guests hear the now-famous \\"Remain seated please; Permanecer sentados por favor\\" safety announcement; it is one of many recordings by the former \\"Voice of Disneyland,\\" Jack Wagner. The recording was changed in 2005 to say \\"Remain seated with your seat belt fastened; Permanecer sentados por favor.\\" The changed English dialogue is still in the voice of Jack Wagner, as it was borrowed from the attraction's breakdown announcement. This recording also introduces the Tomorrowland segment of the \\"Remember... Dreams Come True\\" fireworks show. The safety announcement was featured in the title track of the 1995 No Doubt album Tragic Kingdom, and the line was spoken by Barbie in the film Toy Story 2. The ride's safety message is > \\"For your safety, remain seated with your seat belts fastened, keeping your > hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the bobsled. And be sure to watch your > children. Auf Wiedersehen!\\" Another variant goes, > \\"For your safety, remain seated with your seat belt fastened, keeping your > hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the bobsled. And please, watch your kids. > Thank you!\\" After this saying, riders enter the cavern and climb the lift hill, with the shadow of the Abominable Snowman peering onto guests. Once the bobsled car has disengaged from the chain, riders pass through a dark tunnel. The glowing red eyes of the Abominable Snowman appear, accentuated by his roar, and the trains emerge into a cavern filled with ruined bobsleds and sleighs. A crate stamped with \\"Wells Expedition\\" may also be seen. Both tracks take a left-hand turn, then split off before they can crash into the first animatronic. The cars swirl around the mountain, dipping under tunnels and by the waterfalls. Each track then passes another animatronic of the Snowman. Soon after the second encounter, riders plunge into the alpine lake and return to the station. No on-ride photo is available for this ride. Relations to other Disney parks Disneyland in California is the only Disney theme park with a Matterhorn Bobsled ride. The tracks of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom were based on the designs of the Matterhorn but are not identical to them. The Matterhorn's newer bobsleds, added in 1978, were based on the other ride's rockets, which had debuted in 1975. When Space Mountain was built at Disneyland, it was a completely new design with a single track and vehicles that seated riders side by side rather than behind one another. Various proposals to bring the Matterhorn to Walt Disney World existed over the years, but none came to fruition. The most detailed concept was for the Matterhorn to be the main attraction of a Switzerland Pavilion for the World Showcase at Epcot, but this failed when Disney could not secure a sponsor. Disney's Animal Kingdom contains a roller coaster with a similar theme: Expedition Everest. It is a railway adventure to the top of an abstract version of the Himalayan mountain where riders encounter another fictional mountain beast, the Yeti.  Other public events and changes  In the 1980s, the Matterhorn Ski Club (ride operators led by Chuck Abbott) began buying seeing eye dogs from Guide Dogs of the Desert with the unclaimed coins and knives that fell out of pockets during the ride. This soon expanded to collecting cans from every employee break area. At one time, the bottom floor of the Matterhorn was filled with bags of aluminum cans. The adopting dog owners were treated like royalty whenever they visited the park. After the original 1978 Audio-Animatronic Abominable Snowman figures were removed in 2015, one was placed at the queue area of Disney California Adventure's Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! attraction, which opened on May 27, 2017. The figure is portrayed as one of the Collector's many artifacts on exhibition.  In popular culture  The music video for Randy Newman's song \\"I Love L.A.\\" shows the mountain when he sings \\"look at that mountain\\". The song \\"Disney's Dream Debased\\" by the Fall (from the album The Wonderful and Frightening World Of...) was inspired by the 1984 decapitation accident that happened on the Matterhorn very shortly after band members Mark and Brix Smith had been on the ride themselves. The video game Epic Mickey has its own version of the Matterhorn named Mickeyjunk Mountain, where old Mickey memorabilia goes when it is forgotten. The Abominable Snowman from the attraction appears in the 2013 Mickey Mouse short \\"Yodelberg\\", in which Mickey encounters the creature while climbing a mountain to see Minnie. The bobsled ride vehicles from the attraction litter the entrance of the beast's ice-cavern home.

A DVD recorder is an optical disc recorder that uses optical disc recording technologies to digitally record analog or digital signals onto blank writable DVD media. Such devices are available as either installable drives for computers or as standalone components for use in television studios or home theater systems. As of March 1, 2007 all new tuner- equipped television devices manufactured or imported in the United States must include an ATSC tuner. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has interpreted this rule broadly, including apparatus such as computers with TV tuner cards with video capture ability, videocassette recorders and standalone DVD recorders. NTSC DVD recorders are undergoing a transformation, either adding a digital ATSC tuner or removing over-the-air broadcast television tuner capability entirely. However, these DVD recorders can still record analog audio and analog video. Standalone DVD recorders, alongside Blu-ray recorders, have been relatively scarce in the United States due largely to \\"restrictions on video recording\\" and piracy concerns. Technical information DVD-RW optics Originally, DVD recorders supported one of three standards: DVD-RAM, DVD-RW (using DVD-VR), and DVD+RW (using DVD+VR), none of which are directly compatible. Most current DVD drives support both the + and - standards, while few support the DVD-RAM standard, which is not directly compatible with standard DVD drives. Recording speed is generally denoted in values of X (similar to CD-ROM usage), where 1X in DVD usage is equal to 1.321 MB/s, roughly equivalent to a 9X CD-ROM. In practice, this is largely confined to computer-based DVD recorders, since standalone units generally record in real time, that is, 1X speed. Recorders use a laser (usually 650 nm red) to read and write DVDs. The reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 mW, while the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The faster the writing speed is rated, the stronger the laser. DVD burner lasers often peak at about 100-400 mW in continuous wave (some are pulsed). Computer-based DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) drives DVD recorder drives are standard equipment in many computer systems on the market, after being initially popularized by the Pioneer/Apple SuperDrive; aftermarket drives can cost as little as $20. DVD recorder drives can be used in conjunction with DVD authoring software to create DVDs near or equal to commercial quality, and are also widely used for data backup and exchange. As a general rule, computer-based DVD recorders can also handle CD-R and CD-RW media; in fact, a number of standalone DVD recorders use drives designed for computers. More recently, manufacturers have begun to phase out DVD drives from laptop computers in favor of portability and digital media. Most internal drives are designed with SATA interfaces, with parallel ATA becoming increasingly rare. External drives often use the USB standard for connectivity. DVD recorder drives manufactured since January 2000 are required by the DVD consortium to respect DVD region codes when reading a disc. The drives are incapable of assigning region codes when writing a disc as this is stored on a part of the disc to which PC based and standalone video recorders do not have write access. DVD duplication systems are generally built out of stacks of drives, connected through a computer- based backplane. Standalone DVD recorders When the standalone DVD recorder first appeared on the Japanese consumer market in 1999, early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 USD. More recently, DVD recorders from notable brands have dropped in price. Early units supported only DVD-RAM and DVD-R discs, but newer units can record to DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL. Certain models include mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders (DVRs) to improve ease of use. Standalone DVD recorders generally have basic DVD authoring software built in. In 2009, Panasonic introduced the world's first Blu-ray disc recorder which was capable of recording both DVDs and Blu-ray discs and featured built in satellite HDTV tuners. A year later, Panasonic introduced Blu-ray disc recorders with terrestrial HDTV tuners. DVD recorders have technical advantages over VCRs, including: * Superior video and audio quality * Easy-to-handle smaller form- factor disc media, and higher durability compared to magnetic tape * Random access to video chapters without rewinding or fast-forwarding (serial access) * Onscreen multilingual subtitles and labeling not available on VCRs * Reduced playback wear and tear * High-quality digital copying, with little or no generational quality loss * Improved editing on rewritable media * Playlisting * No risk of accidentally recording over existing content or unexpectedly running out of space during recording * Easily accessible recordings as a result of chapter menus Note: Blu-ray disc recorders can record full high definition videos on BD-Rs and BD-REs. Disadvantages include: * Slow initial access/load times due to the optical nature of the disc * Limited rewritability on DVD-RW/+RW discs (typically around 1000). DVD-RAM is better suited for high frequency re-recording (around 100,000 rewrites) * Relatively short life of the laser diodes (average of about 2 years depending on usage). In addition, DVDs recorded with DVD recorders in the standard DVD format must be finalized to view in other DVD players. This disadvantage does not apply to discs recorded in the newer and more flexible DVD-VR format or the DVD+VR format - the latter (but not the former) also being compatible with DVD players. The implementation of MPEG-2 compression used on most standalone DVD recorders is required to compress the picture data in real time, producing results that may not be up to par with professionally rendered DVD video, which can take days to compress. Standard definition VCR replacement DVD video recorders typically has a set of standard recording modes for fitting 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hour modes (XP, SP, LP, EP, SLP, SEP, respectively) on single layer 12 cm discs (DVD5).About.com, \\"DVD Record Modes - Recording Times For DVDs\\", Robert Silva (accessed 2014-05-10) These modes are comparable to those found on VHS VCRs using standard 120-tapes, having SP, LP, SLP modes of 2, 4, 6 hour. The United States converted its over-the-air television broadcasts to digital \\"ATSC\\" in June 2009. This will have a limited impact in ending the need for DVD recorders to perform realtime MPEG-2 encoding or transcoding. The only setup where ATSC could eliminate MPEG-2 encoding/transcoding in a DVD recorder would be where an antenna is hooked directly into a DVD recorder that has an integrated ATSC tuner. However, the DVD recorder will have to transcode the ATSC MPEG-2 into DVD-Video-compliant MPEG-2 if the ATSC MPEG-2 stream isn't already DVD-Video-compatible. This would require transcoding for all high-definition broadcasts and some if not all standard-definition broadcasts. The same general situation applies to digital cable service; only DVD recorders with integrated digital cable (\\"QAM\\") tuners can avoid transcoding, and then only if the digital cable system is already sending a DVD-Video- compatible MPEG-2 stream, which again requires transcoding of all HD content and some if not all SD content. All other setups (digital cable box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, satellite box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, DVD recorder tuning and recording analog cable channels which are still permitted after 2/2009, etc.) usually always involve an analog step with MPEG-2 encoding being necessary inside the DVD recorder. A number of manufacturers have combined DVD recorders with mechanical hard disk drive-based digital video recorders, allowing for recording to large fixed disks, and the ability to view these recordings off the hard disk at a later date. In Japan, AVCREC recorders, which are able to record MPEG-2 or AVC high definition video from ISDB broadcast with or without re-encoding, get increasingly popular. Initially, AVCREC recorders use DVD recordable discs, but newer models are able to record onto Blu-ray discs as well onto hard disk drives. = ATSC standalone DVD recorders = As a result of the North American digital switchover, tuner-equipped devices manufactured or imported into the United States are now required by the US Federal Communications Commission to include digital tuners. This has caused most new VHS recorders to be implemented as DVD/VCR combo units, or to be manufactured without tuners. The US requirement of ATSC compatibility forces inclusion of MPEG-2 decoding hardware, which is already part of all DVD players but which otherwise would be unnecessary in an analog-only VCR. A tunerless recorder does not have RF coaxial connections and can only be used to record from an external device, such as a cable converter box with a composite video output. An ATSC-capable DVD unit can also serve as a more-powerful alternative to digital television adapters, which allow DTV reception with older NTSC analog televisions. The DVD recorders offer additional capabilities, such as automated VCR-style timeshifting of programming and a variety of output formats, that are deliberately not included in the most common mass-market US ATSC converters. Unlike the more common digital television adapter boxes, newer DVD recorder units are able to tune both analog and digital signals - an advantage when receiving low-power television and foreign (analogue) signals. Some, however, do suffer from many of the same design limitations as the less costly converter boxes, including poorly designed signal strength meters, incomplete display of broadcast program information, incompatibility with antenna rotators or CEA-909 smart antennas and inability to add digital channels without wiping out all existing channels and rescanning the entire band. A DVD recording of an over-the-air HDTV broadcast is at DVD resolution, which is inferior to the original broadcast with 720p or 1080i resolution. Some units also provide limited USB or flash memory interface capability, often only supporting viewing of digital camera still photos or playback of MP3s with no ability to write video to these media. A number of DVD recorders are also capable of recording to SVCD, VCD and Audio CD formats. Recording to DVDs can be done at different speeds that may take between 1 and 6 hours (even up to 8 hours on certain models) on a standard (single sided 12 cm) blank DVD. A trade off exists between recording time and video quality. = MiniDVD recorders = 8 cm miniDVDs are used on some digital camcorders, primarily those meant for a consumer market (\\"point and shoot\\"); such discs are usually playable on a full-sized DVD player, but may not record on a full-sized DVD recorder system. Though popular for their convenience (in the manner of VHS-C), DVD camcorders are not suitable for professional use due to higher levels of compression compared to MiniDV and the difficulty of editing MPEG-2 video.

He was the older brother of American novelist Kurt Vonnegut.  Early life  Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr (November 24, 1884 – October 1, 1957), a partner in the firm of Vonnegut, Wright & Yeager, and homemaker Edith Sophia Lieber (d. May 14, 1944). He was named after his grandfather, architect Bernard Vonnegut Sr, co-founder of the firm of Vonnegut & Bohn. He attended Park School in Indianapolis and earned a B.S. in chemistry (1936) and Ph.D. in physical chemistry (1939) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\"Biographical on Kurt Vonnegut, Sr.\\" Lake Maxinkuckee Its Intrigue History & Genealogy; Culver, Marshall, Indiana  Professional career  General Electric Research Laboratory In 1945, Vonnegut started work at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. It was there, on November 14, 1946, that he discovered that silver iodide could be used as a nucleating agent to seed clouds. Seeding clouds involves inserting large quantities of a nucleating agent into clouds to facilitate the formation of ice crystals. The intent of this process is to cause the clouds to produce rain or snow. Rain- and snow-making companies still use silver iodide as a nucleating agent in seeding clouds. Vonnegut left General Electric in 1952, taking a job at Arthur D. Little, Inc. In 1967, Vonnegut became a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University at Albany, The State University of New York. He was named a professor emeritus upon his retirement in 1985. In the course of his career Vonnegut accumulated 28 patents. He was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 1997 for his paper \\"Chicken Plucking as Measure of Tornado Wind Speed.\\"  Personal life  He was married to Lois Bowler Vonnegut, with whom he had five sons. She died in 1972. He died of cancer on April 25, 1997, at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, New York. His brother, Kurt Vonnegut, alluded to Bernard's work in some of his works, most famously in Cat's Cradle.

A postcard from the early 20th century, showing the dance pavilion on Cedar Point, Ohio, built in 1882, then labeled \\"The largest Dance Floor on Lake Erie\\". The Dance Hall at Toledo Beach in Michigan, 1906 Dance hall in its general meaning is a hall for dancing. From the earliest years of the twentieth century until the early 1960s, the dance hall was the popular forerunner of the discothèque or nightclub. The majority of towns and cities in the West had at least one dance hall, and almost always featured live musicians playing a range of music from strict tempo ballroom dance music to big band, swing and jazz. One of the most famous dance hall musicians was Glenn Miller. Other structural forms of dance halls include the dance pavilion which has a roof but no walls, and the open-air platform which has no roof or walls. The open air nature of the dance pavilion was both a feature and a drawback. The taxi dance hall is a dance hall with a specific arrangement, wherein the patrons hire hall employees to dance with them. Starting in the early 1930s, The Savoy, a dance hall in Harlem (a black neighborhood in New York City) was the first truly integrated building in the United States — for both the dancers and the musicians. \\"We didn't care about the color of your skin. All we wanted to know was: Can you dance?\\"Burns, Ken. Jazz (2001), TV documentary The early days of rock n' roll were briefly played out in dance halls until they were superseded by nightclubs.

The Cobra was chambered in .38 Special, .38 Colt New Police, .32 Colt New Police, and .22 LR. It holds six shots of ammunition and was sold by Colt from 1950 until 1981.Gun Collector's Club: Colt Cobra In December 2016, it was announced that Colt would be producing a new run of the Colt Cobra with a steel frame and a fiber optic front sight. This model was released in early 2017. Product development and usage The Cobra was made in two models: the First Model, made from 1950-1971 and weighing 15 ounces unloaded with 2-inch barrel, and an improved Second Model, made from 1972-1981, recognizable by its shrouded ejector rod and Baughman-style ramp front sight, with an unloaded weight of 16 ounces. The Cobra is the same overall size and configuration as the famous Colt Detective Special and uses the same size \\"D\\" frame, except that the Cobra's frame is constructed of lightweight aluminum alloy as compared to the all-steel frame of the Detective Special. In the mid-1960s, the Detective Special's and Cobra's grip frame was shortened to the same size as that of the Agent. The Cobra was produced in calibers .38 Special, 32 Colt New Police, .22 LR, and a rare few in .38 S&W.; The .38 Special Cobra was available in 2, 3, 4, and 5 inch barrel lengths. The .32 caliber version was available in 2- and 3-inch barrel lengths. The .22 LR Cobra was available only with the 3-inch barrel. Standard Cobras were blued with round-butt grip frames. The .38 Special Cobra with a 2-inch barrel was available with a nickel finish at additional cost. Early models also had a square-butt option. Colt Cobra revolver 2017 re-release. It was announced in 2016 that Colt would re-release the Colt Cobra in 2017. The Third Model (2017-present) is offered only as a 6 shot DA/SA revolver in .38 Special (+P Capable) with a 2\\" barrel. This model will be offered with a Matte Stainless Steel finish and has an unloaded weight of 25 ounces. At the 2018 Shot Show, Colt debuted the Colt Night Cobra, which has a matte black finish and a front night sight. It is also double action only. Production subvariants =Colt Aircrewman= The Colt M13 Aircrewman was an ultra-lightweight version of the Detective Special constructed of aluminum alloy, and made from 1951-1957 for use by US Air Force aircrews. They are distinguished by the Air Force medallion in the place of the Colt medallion on the checkered wooden grips, as well as a cylinder made of aluminum alloy. Within two years of issuance, reports of cylinder and/or frame failure began to plague the Aircrewman and its Smith & Wesson counterpart, the Smith & Wesson Model 12, despite issuing a dedicated low- pressure .38 Special military cartridge, the Caliber .38 Ball, M41 round.TM 43-0001-27, Army Ammunition Data Sheets - Small Caliber Ammunition, FSC 1305, Washington, D.C.: Dept. of the Army, 29 April 1994: The original USAF .38 M41 ball cartridge had a pressure limit of only 13,000 CUP, propelling its 130-grain FMJ bullet at a mild 725 feet per second.Williams, Kevin, Colt Two- Inch Revolvers in U.S. Military Service, The Rampant Colt, Colt Collectors Association Magazine (June 2009) However, the cylinder fractures continued, and the weapons were eventually withdrawn from service.Williams, Kevin, Colt Two-Inch Revolvers in U.S. Military Service, The Rampant Colt, Colt Collectors Association Magazine (June 2009) =Colt Courier= The Courier was produced in .22 Long Rifle, 32 Colt NP, 32 S&W; long and short. Frame and cylinder are constructed of lightweight aluminum alloy. It was made from 1954 to 1956. Approximately 3,000 were produced in the two years. =Colt Agent= The Colt Agent was another model similar to the Cobra. The original Agents were very well made, with high polished finishes and highly checkered walnut grips. The bottom of the Agent grips was slightly shorter than that of the Cobra. The original Agent weighed 14 ounces and was available only in .38 Special caliber, with a 2-inch barrel and blued finish. It was made from 1955 to 1979. The original Agents had a smaller grip frame from the Cobra which made for a deeper concealment and the grip frame was later changed to match the Cobra in the late 60s. A slightly revised version of the Agent was released in 1973 with a shrouded barrel with a weight of 16 ounces. In 1982, the Agent was briefly revived by Colt, this time with a parkerized finish; production continued until 1986, which made the Agent a much cheaper version of the Cobra. =Colt Viper= The Viper was essentially a 4\\" barrel version of the alloy-framed Colt Cobra in .38 Special. Introduced in 1977 and only produced that year, the Viper did not sell as well as Colt expected and was discontinued. In recent years, owing to its limited production run, the Viper has become quite collectable. Examples in good condition fetch unusually high prices. Ammunition Some have recommended against the use of +P-rated .38 Special cartridges in aluminum-framed Colt revolvers, as the Cobra was designed well before the \\"+P\\" designation. Others point out that +P ammunition is the same pressure as the regular pressure ammunition was before SAAMI lowered the standards in 1972 as a result of industry requests. They point out that the post-'72 loads are merely regular pressure ammunition labeled as \\"+P\\". Some experts have done considerable testing so as to prove that +P .38 specials are not truly hot loads.http://shootingwithhobie.blogspot.com/2009/01/p-phenomenon-by- saxonpig.html In the owners' manual accompanying some post-1972 Cobra revolvers, Colt recommended the use of +P ammunition for 2nd Model Cobra frames only, with the stipulation that the gun be returned to the factory for inspection every 1,000 rounds (compared with a 2,000–3,000 round interval for the 2nd Model steel-framed Detective Special). The new 2017 reintroduction Colt Cobra revolver is rated to accept +P ammunition. The Cobra should never be fired with extreme-pressure +P+ ammunition as there are no industry standards for such loads.

Rohan was arrested for the arson attack on 23 August 1969. He was tried, found to be insane, and hospitalised in a mental institution. On 14 May 1974 he was deported from Israel \\"on humanitarian grounds, for further psychiatric treatment near his family\\". He was subsequently transferred to the Callan Park Hospital in Australia. Some sources say that he died in 1995, but an investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 2009 found that was still alive then and a few years later he spoke to an ABC journalist. Illness According to a detailed article by Abraham Rabinovich, Rohan's first known case of auditory hallucinations (which he believed to be divine 'revelations') came in Australia in 1964, when he was asked by his employer to transport \\"an augur, a 30-foot-long lift device\\" by truck 35 miles to another location, but was commanded by a voice in his head not to do so. His manager told him he was \\"mentally sick,\\" and he was committed to Bloomfield Mental Hospital for four months. After his release he moved first to England where he worked at a hospital in Middlesex, and then to Israel where he arrived by ship in March 1969. He volunteered at Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon in the Sharon Valley between Haifa and Tel Aviv where he stayed a few months. According to Kibbutzniks, one night they were startled by wild shouts from Rohan; when one volunteer attempted to calm him, Rohan told them he thought that perhaps he was Jewish. He spoke to an American theology student and volunteer of \\"the imminence of the Messiah's coming and the construction of a new temple\\". From the kibbutz he went to Jerusalem, staying in hotels. After reading a biblical passage in the Book of Zechariah: > \\"Behold the man whose name is the branch, for he shall grow up in his place > and he shall build the Temple of the Lord. It is he who shall build the > Temple of the Lord and shall bear royal honor and shall sit and rule upon > the throne.\\" Rohan became convinced that he was \\"the branch\\" and destined to \\"build the Temple of the Lord\\". Arson of Al-Aqsa minbar of Saladin in the al-Aqsa Mosque (photographed 1900-1910) On the morning of 21 August 1969, Rohan started a fire fuelled by kerosene in the al-Aqsa Mosque. The fire destroyed an intricately designed 12th-century minbar, or pulpit, known as the minbar of Saladin. Rohan, who had been in Israel on a tourist visa, was arrested two days later. He pleaded insanity and was deported. =Motives= Rohan, a Christian, stated that he considered himself \\"the Lord's emissary\\" and that he tried to destroy the al-Aqsa Mosque acting upon divine instructions to enable the Jews of Israel to rebuild the Temple on the Temple Mount in accordance with the Book of Zechariah, thereby hastening the second coming of Jesus Christ. (Rohan mistakenly believed that the al-Aqsa Mosque occupied the site of the temple, when in fact the Dome of the Rock did.) Rohan was a subscriber of The Plain Truth magazine published by the Worldwide Church of God's (WCG) founder Herbert W. Armstrong and stated that he had begun his attempt after reading an editorial by Armstrong in the June 1967 edition. The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London pictured Rohan on its front page with a copy of The Plain Truth magazine sticking out from his outside jacket pocket. On 26 September 1969, Armstrong, in a letter to financial contributors to his The World Tomorrow program, distanced himself from Rohan: Prior to the Rohan incident, in 1968 Armstrong, via WCG's sponsored Ambassador College, had become involved with the Israeli government in archaeological digs in the area of the Temple Mount. =Response= The fire at Al-Aqsa was the cause of great anger in the Muslim world, and demonstrations and riots occurred as far away as Kashmir India. Many Muslims alleged Rohan's actions were part of a wider plot by Israelis, while some Israelis have attacked claims by some Palestinians and other Muslims that Rohan was Jewish, when in fact he was Christian. Both Israelis and Palestinian have been accused by the other side of interference or sabotage in putting out the fire. Chief Rabbinate of Israel According to the Jewish Political Studies Review, author Yoel Cohen recorded that the official Israeli Chief Rabbinate adopted a mostly conservative stance toward the capture by Israel of the Temple Mount in 1967, in response to questions of whether to rebuild the Temple and reinstitute the sacrificial service to whether to allow Jews to ascend the Temple Mount to pray: Cohen further footnoted these remarks with comments from an interview: Arab/Muslim reactions =U.N. resolution= On 28 August 1969 a complaint was submitted to the United Nations Security Council by twenty-four Muslim countries in response to the Al Aqsa arson attempt. Mohammad El Farra of Jordan stated: =Yassir Arafat, by and on his behalf= Yassir Arafat later developed a regular television interview speech in which he would refer back to this act of attempted arson, while avoiding mention of Rohan by name.

On display were items from Bristol's industrial past – including aviation, car and bus manufacture, and printing – and exhibits documenting Bristol's maritime history. The museum was managed by Bristol City Council along with nearby preserved industrial relics along Prince's Wharf, including the Bristol Harbour Railway, cranes and a small fleet of preserved vessels. The railway, cranes and vessels all now form part of the working exhibits at M Shed Museum. The museum closed its doors to the public on 29 October 2006. M Shed, the new Museum of Bristol has been created on the site, keeping the same façade and many of the exhibits. It opened 17 June 2011. A website has been created to try to capture the essence of the museum and some of its memories.

Exhibits included what is believed to be the world's first purpose-built holiday caravan to be compared with a 1950s equivalent, the Grenville steam carriage, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, carriages and buses. =Aviation= On the upper floor the aviation gallery told the story of Bristol's involvement in aircraft manufacture and contained a collection of Bristol-made aero engines, a Bristol-built helicopter, a mock-up flight deck of Concorde and scale models showing the many aircraft built in the city. On the same floor the story of the Port of Bristol was told with models, paintings and other exhibits. =Print & Pack= The adjacent Print & Pack gallery told the story of one of Bristol's biggest industries with machinery and products. This was a particularly popular working exhibit, with live demonstrations of printing machinery such as Linotype and Letterpress. These same exhibits also printed many of the museum's own leaflets, tickets and flyers. =Bristol and Transatlantic Slavery gallery= Elsewhere in the museum, the Bristol and Transatlantic Slavery gallery told the story of Bristol's involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade between the UK, Africa and the Caribbean, from its early days through abolition and to recent times. =Historic ships, cranes and trains= Normally moored in front of the developing new museum is the collection of historic vessels, which included the 1934 fireboat \\"Pyronaut\\" and two tugs: John King built as a diesel tug in 1935 and Mayflower, the world's oldest surviving steam tug built in 1861. On the quayside outside the museum are four electrically powered cargo cranes built in 1951 by Stothert & Pitt. A short distance to the west is much older crane, the sole surviving operational example of a Fairbairn steam crane. Built in 1878, also by Stothert & Pitt, it was in regular use until 1973 loading and unloading ships and railway wagons with loads up to 35 tons. It has been restored and is in working order, operating on some bank holidays and the Bristol Harbour Festival. Bristol Harbour Railway continues to offer train rides along the quayside on bank holidays, using restored steam locomotives and rolling stock.

They are also installed on some armored fighting vehicles, in particular NBC reconnaissance vehicles, in order to help detect, localise and analyse tactical nuclear detonations. They are often used alongside pressure and sound sensors in this role in addition to standard radiation sensors. Some nuclear bunkers and military facilities may also be equipped with such sensors alongside seismic event detectors. The bhangmeter was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory by a team lead by Herman Hoerlin. History The bhangmeter was invented, and the first proof-of- concept device was built, in 1948 to measure the nuclear test detonations of Operation Sandstone. Prototype and production instruments were later built by EG&G;, and the name \\"bhangmeter\\" was coined in 1950. Bhangmeters became standard instruments used to observe US nuclear tests. A bhangmeter was developed to observe the detonations of Operation Buster-Jangle (1951) and Operation Tumbler-Snapper (1952). These tests lay the groundwork for a large deployment of nationwide North American bhangmeters with the Bomb Alarm System (1961-1967). US president John F. Kennedy and the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty on August 5, 1963, under the condition that each party could use its own technical means to monitor the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere or in outer space. Bhangmeters were first installed, in 1961, aboard a modified US KC-135A aircraft monitoring the pre-announced Soviet test of Tsar Bomba. The Vela satellites were the first space-based observation devices jointly developed by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission. The first generation of Vela satellites were not equipped with bhangmeters but with X-ray sensors to detect the intense single pulse of X-rays produced by a nuclear explosion. The first satellites which incorporated bhangmeters were the Advanced Vela satellites. Since 1980, bhangmeters are part of US GPS navigation satellites. Description Greenhouse George early fireball evolution, showing the initial dimming of the first light pulse Graph of a nuclear fireball's surface temperature and diameter over time The silicon photodiode sensors are designed to detect the distinctive bright double pulse of visible light that is emitted from atmospheric nuclear weapons explosions. This signature consists of a short and intense flash lasting around 1 millisecond, followed by a second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking a fraction of a second to several seconds to build up. This signature, with a double intensity maximum, is characteristic of atmospheric nuclear explosions and is the result of the Earth's atmosphere becoming opaque to visible light and transparent again as the explosion's shock wave travels through it. The effect occurs because the surface of the early fireball is quickly overtaken by the expanding \\"case shock\\", the atmospheric shock wave composed of the ionised plasma of what was once the casing and other matter of the device.NUCLEAR EVENTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES by the Borden institute...\\"case shock\\" Although it emits a considerable amount of light itself, it is opaque and prevents the far brighter fireball from shining through. The net result recorded is a decrease of the light visible from outer space as the shock wave expands, producing the first peak recorded by the bhangmeter. As it expands, the shock wave cools off and becomes less opaque to the visible light produced by the inner fireball. The bhangmeter starts eventually to record an increase in visible light intensity. The expansion of the fireball leads to an increase of its surface area and consequently an increase of the amount of visible light radiated off to space. The fireball continuing to cool down, the amount of light eventually starts to decrease, causing the second peak observed by the bhangmeter. The time between the first and second peaks can be used to determine its nuclear yield. The effect is unambiguous for explosions below about altitude, but above this height a more ambiguous single pulse is produced. Origin of the name The name of the detector is a pun, which was bestowed upon it by Fred Reines, one of the scientists working on the project. The name is derived from the Hindi word \\"bhang\\", a locally grown variety of cannabis which is smoked or drunk to induce intoxicating effects, the joke being that one would have to be on drugs to believe the bhangmeter detectors would work properly. This is in contrast to a \\"bangmeter\\" one might associate with detection of nuclear explosions.

Early years Muñoz was the first of three siblings born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her father, Teodoro was a nuclear engineer and her mother, Astrid, a retired executive secretary. They were both strict in their upbringing of Muñoz, who received her primary and secondary education in San Juan. She enjoyed going to the beach and reading fashion magazines as a young girl. In 1988, then- fourteen-year-old Muñoz was offered an opportunity to model in Spain, but her mother objected. Biography on Webwombat Modeling career In 1993, Muñoz was visiting a friend in Miami when a modeling agent suggested she try a career in fashion in France. Muñoz accepted the idea and left for France without consulting her parents. In Paris, she became one of the first latinas to break through as a model. After working in Europe for several years, Muñoz relocated to New York City, where she appeared on the covers of notable fashion magazines such as Vogue, Marie Claire, L'Officiel, Elle, and Harper's Bazaar, and appeared in fashion campaigns and commercials for Balenciaga, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, GAP, L'Oréal, Mango, Nokia, Saks Fifth Avenue, Valentino, and Yves Saint Laurent \\"Rive Gauche\\" and \\"In Love Again\\" fragrances.

The prayer was co-sponsored by the progressive Muslim online magazine Muslim WakeUp! and Asra Nomani's Muslim Women's Freedom Tour. The event, which was attended by about 150 congregants in New York City and heavily covered by international media, became a huge controversy, galvanizing both supporters and detractors around the world. Opponents, in particular M. A. Muqtedar Khan, argued that reform should be restricted to social matters, not matters of worship. Supporters, however, asserted that nothing in the Qur'an, the Muslim holy scripture, prevents a woman from leading mixed-gender prayers, and that restrictions are based on outmoded cultural and patriarchal notions. PMU's co- chair, Pamela Taylor, reinforced PMU's position when she joined hands with the Muslim Canadian Congress and the United Muslim Association to be the first woman to deliver the Friday sermon and lead the mixed-gender congregation in a mosque on July 1, 2005. Current state PMU is now defunct, due to a schism. In July 2005, board member Muqtedar Khan resigned. In August 2005, three of the four founding members, Omid Safi, Hussein Ibish and Sarah Eltantawi resigned along with Laury Silvers and Michael Muhammad Knight (Ahmed Nassef was the fourth founding member). When Michael Muhammad Knight resigned, he predicted that PMU would collapse within one year. In December 2006, chair Pamela Taylor and executive director Ani Zonneveld resigned from the board, citing unreconcilable conflicts with board member Tarek Fatah. Soon after, Fatah, who controls PMU's e-mail discussion list, blocked posting by list members.

President Larry Curtis retired in July 2008 after 24 years with Shari's and was succeeded by Bruce MacDiarmid. In 2009, Shari's Restaurants took ownership of a number of northern California Baker's Square restaurants and converted them to operate under Shari's name. Since approximately the middle of 2011–2012, the chain has updated its logo and bills itself on signs and in media as \\"Shari's Cafe & Pies.\\" As of August 2017, the company operated 95 locations in the states of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nebraska, and Wyoming. By July 2020, the number was 93. Also, Shari's had many restaurants in Colorado, Utah, and Arizona, but the restaurant company decided to permanently close all its locations in those three states sometime between the very late 1990s and early 2000s due to poor management. The chain is currently operated by Sharis Management Corporation in Beaverton. Most, but not all locations are open 24 hours a day, with a focus on specialty pies. Samuel Borgese was named CEO in September 2017, replacing MacDiarmid. In September 2018, it was announced that Shari's Cafe & Pies had taken over Carrows and Coco's Bakery. Restaurant design Garden Home, Oregon in 2009 Shari's restaurants are notable for their patented hexagonal design. The Bergquists originally sought to sell their patented idea to another company, but when they were unable to find a restaurant company willing to buy they started their own chain in Hermiston. Most Shari's restaurants are built to this design; it places the kitchen in the center of the restaurant, providing easy access for the waiting staff to serve customers, and increases the number of tables next to a window. Historically, upon entering a Shari's restaurant, the dining area was divided by half, with one half on either side of the entrance. One side would allow smoking and the other would be non-smoking. Today the restaurants are non-smoking; however some Shari's restaurants have opened up video lottery rooms (some of which allow smoking) which occupy a portion of the former dining room and are walled off.

He was a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2018, representing East Yarra Province (2002–2006) and Eastern Metropolitan Region (2006–2018). He served as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister for Manufacturing in the Baillieu Ministry from 2010 to 2013, but was dropped in a reshuffle when Denis Napthine replaced Baillieu as Premier. Dalla-Riva was born in the regional town of Orbost, but grew up in Beechworth, before moving to Melbourne. After graduating from the Macleod High School (now Macleod College), he joined the police force, and was promoted to the rank of detective in 1988. He worked in a number of areas associated with financial crime, including the major fraud and asset recovery squads, and also spent time working for the National Crime Authority. While still working in the police force, he studied business at the Phillip Institute of Technology (now part of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). In 1995, after seven years as a detective, Dalla-Riva left the police force, and entered the private sector. He held various managerial roles at Woolworths Limited, before becoming the General Manager for a national food manufacturer. Later, Dalla-Riva became the Group Manager for a large disability service before becoming the State Regional Manager for a US multi- national company.http://www.richarddalla-riva.com/ He received an MBA from the University of Southern Queensland in 1998.

The New Christian social category was made to refer to and deal with Sephardic and Bene Israel Jews, and the Muslim Moors who converted whether willfully or forcefully to Roman Catholicism. It was used in Spain and Portugal as well as in the colonies of the Spanish and Portuguese empires. Those Jews forcibly convetred to Christianity were knows as new Christians According to António José Saraiva, a famous or \\"Emeritus\\" Portuguese Literature Teacher and Historian, \\"The reality of the dichotomy between Old and New Christian only existed in the Inquisitorial taxonomy. The religious or ethnic definition of the New Christians was, in the last analysis, merely formal and bureaucratic. In addition, the label of the New Christian can be based on rumors originating from dubious genealogies, slander and intrigue.\\" It was developed and employed after the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula by the Catholic Monarchs. By law, the category of New Christians included not only recent converts but also all their known baptized descendants with any fraction or quantum of New Christian blood up to the third generation, the fourth generation being exempted. In Phillip II's reign, it included any person with any fraction of New Christian blood \\"from time immemorial\\". In Portugal, it was only in 1772 that Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal, finally decreed an end to the legal distinction between New Christians and Old Christians. New Christian as a legal category Although the category of New Christian is meaningless in Christian theology and ecclesiology, it was nevertheless introduced by the Old Christians who claimed \\"pure unmixed\\" Christian bloodlines in order to distinguish themselves as a unique group, separated from ethnic Jews and Iberian Muslims. The Old Christians wanted to legally and socially distinguish themselves from the conversos (converts to Christianity), who they considered to be tainted by virtue of their non-Spanish bloodlines, even though in the case of Muslims, the overwhelming majority of Spain's Muslims were also of indigenous Iberian stock, themselves the descendants of native Iberians who earlier converted to Islam under Muslim rule. In practice, for New Christians of Jewish origin, the concept of New Christian was a legal mechanism and manifestation of racial antisemitism, being a prejudice against Jews as a racial/ethnic group, rather than Judaism as a religion. For those of Moorish origin, it was a manifestation of racial anti-Berberism and/or anti-Arabism. =Cleanliness of blood and related concepts= The related Spanish development of an ideology of limpieza de sangre (\\"cleanliness of blood\\") also excluded New Christians from society -- universities, emigration to the New World, many professions -- regardless of their sincerity as converts. Other derogatory terms applied to each of the converting groups included marranos (i.e. \\"pigs\\") for New Christians of Jewish origin, and moriscos (a term which carried pejorative connotations) for New Christians of Andalusian origin. Discrimination and persecution Aside from social stigma and ostracism, the consequences of legal or social categorization as a New Christian included restrictions of civil and political rights, abuses of those already-limited civil rights, social and sometimes legal restrictions on whom one could marry (anti-miscegenation laws), social restrictions on where one could live, legal restrictions of entry into the professions and the clergy, legal restrictions and prohibition of immigration to and settlement in the newly colonized Spanish territories in the Americas, deportation from the colonies. In addition to the above restrictions and discrimination endured by New Christians, the Spanish Crown and Church authorities also subjected New Christians to persecution, prosecution and capital punishment for actual or alleged practice of the family's former religion. After the Alhambra Decree of expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain in 1492 and a similar Portuguese decree in 1497, the remaining Jewish population in Iberia became officially Christian by default. The New Christians, especially those of Jewish origin, were always under suspicion of being judaizantes (\\"judaizers\\"), that is, apostizing from the Christian religion and being active crypto-Jews. Emigration =Jewish \\"New Christian\\" emigration= Despite the discrimination and legal restrictions, many Jewish-origin New Christians found ways of circumventing these restrictions for emigration and settlement in the Iberian colonies of the New World, by falsifying or buying \\"cleanliness of blood\\" documentation, or attaining perjured affidavits attesting to untainted Old Christian pedigrees. The descendants of these, who could not return to Judaism, became the modern-day Christian-professing Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Latin America (it is only in the modern era that a nascent community, the Neo- Western Sephardim, is currently returning to Judaism from among this population). Also as a result of the unceasing trials and persecutions by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, other Jewish-origin New Christians opted to migrate out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1800s towards Amsterdam, and also London, whereupon in their new tolerant environment of refuge outside the Iberian cultural sphere they eventually returned to Judaism. The descendants of these became the Spanish and Portuguese Jews (also known more ambiguously in the Netherlands as Spanish and Portuguese Jews, among other names elsewhere). =Muslim \\"New Christian\\" emigration= Although Iberian Muslims were protected in the treaty signed at the fall of Granada, and the New Christian descendants of former Muslims weren't expelled until over a century later, even so, in the meantime, different waves of Iberian Muslims and New Christians of Moorish origin left and settled across North Africa and the Ottoman Empire. History of New Christian conversions =Spain= Throughout the Middle Ages, Sephardim (Iberian Jews) and Moros (Iberian Muslims) sometimes converted to Christianity, usually as the result of coercion: physical, economic, and social pressures. In the 14th century there was increasing pressure, especially against the Jews, that culminated in the riots of 1391 in Seville and other cities in which many Jews were massacred. These riots caused the destruction of the Aljamas (Jewish quarters) of the cities and sparked many conversions, a trend that continued throughout the 15th century. =Portugal= Introductory Note by Professor António José Saraiva The reading of this subject at a glance, refers immediately to the understanding: \\"The only reality of the dichotomy between Old and New Christian only existed in the Inquisitorial taxonomy. The religious or ethnic definition of the new Christians was, in the last analysis, merely formal and bureaucratic. In addition, the label of the New Christian can be based on rumors originating from dubious genealogies, slander and intrigue. \\"In the book\\" Account of the Cruelties exercised by the inquisition in Portugal, 1708 \\"the author writes that\\" the New Christian label is based in mere presumptions, padded and swollen with inventions and lies. \\" The latter, being a book that does not identify the author is not properly accepted, but that of its analysis provides \\"logic\\" with descriptions that in their evaluation correspond, interconnect, hidden missing facts, in the form that the Inquisition reported the procedures. António José Saraiva reviewed his work five times, with discussions of decades with other authors as I.S. Révah, having in his last revision presented moderately a vision that will carry forward the study of such a complex subject, being antisemitism. The first consequence of history is to inform, educate, so that the mistakes of the past do not repeat themselves. Neither Jesus Christ defended the cataloging of human persons, individuals, their persecution, whether by skin color, religion, culture, etc. , but rather the understanding and brotherhood among individuals of the human race. The Portuguese Inquisition advocated extirpating Jews for the heresy of practicing their own religion, and thus, to purify Portuguese Catholicism did indeed have other ends. The result would be the opposite in inculcating people to Judaism, who were not, making the Inquisition in a \\"Factory of Jews\\". The \\"New Christian\\" was socially co-extensive to the mercantile middle-class Portuguese that the feudal Portuguese of the upper society did not want to tolerate. The victims of the Inquisition would amount to forty thousand, so categorized, that they were mostly distinct Christians, devotees, partially but fictionally with Jewish ancestry. That was his only crime. The procedure of the Portuguese Inquisition was not designed with the conception of distinguishing Guilty from Innocents, considering any defenders, once categorized as \\"New Christians\\", some Judaizers. The \\"Marranos\\" was a term that would fall into disuse for the \\"New Christians,\\" and the word \\"Jew\\" took over the accusatory function, many authors having combined or combined the designations in such a complex story. This was the ostensible justification since 1536 and would last for 230 years. [4] Who were the Jews? Who were the Inquisitors? Even today it is a puzzle full of paradoxes. One of the authors, Julio Caro Baroja, was based on the \\"authenticity\\" of the inquisitorial documents, which does not imply its veracity, and did so with a Marxist point of view, which António José Saraiva does not use. There was a mistrust between Hellenists and Judaism, and of the various tendencies and conjugations that would best be Hellenic Christianity. From then on, only two religions would dispute souls, as the author would say: Judaism and Christianity. An important detail is that the born religion preferred to join Jews, what is true even to the Apostle Paul. Several Roman Emperors persecuted Christians as anti- Romanesque (see the story of St. Sebastian). In 313 the Emperor Constantine was converted to Christianity and would become the official religion of the Empire. Jews existed in the Iberian Peninsula from before Christianity. In 409 they invaded to the Iberian Peninsula several barbarian tribes, Germanicos Swabi, Vandals, Alanos following the Visigodos that were allies of the Romans, establishing the Hispano-Visigothic Kingdom. The Visigothic Kings were Aryans. The First German-Roman Emperor would be Alaric II, who initiates persecutions to Jews, passing by the Council of Toledo in 633, and in the 6th council applies the \\"Placitum\\" that distinguished or guarded the converted Jews to the Christianity, until the 6º degree of kinship or consanguinity until the invasion of the Moors in 711. The reconquest was then given and persecutions continued, modifying some characteristics until in the reign of John II (1425-1454) they would reach Peace. At the end of the fifteenth century he would return to Spain. According to António José Saraiva, Firstly, the decree dated March 19, 1497 ordered that all children under the age of 14 be extirpated from their families and baptized, not knowing how many were returned to their Fathers after the General Conversion of June 1497. Another decree promulgated later on May 13, 1497, excepted for a period of 20 years, the investigation of Jews who converted to Christianity. It would, however, spur boom in the Catholic Church and the People, which would originate judgments of people who were not Jewish or just because they had some Jewish ascendant, which was often false. The Inquisition was provided with six witnesses who, either because they feared for life and their relatives, others chosen for the trial to take place according to the Inquisitorial pretensions, in many cases did not present facts and it was enough to proclaim \\"the doubt\\" about the accused. Interestingly enough, the \\"accused\\" were not given the accusers' knowledge. They did not know the witnesses who were not revealed to them, what facts they enunciated, making the defense of an accusatory process almost impossible. This theme will be addressed in the \\"First Portuguese Inquisition Regiment-in the year 1552\\", \\"Second Regiment of Portuguese Inquisition-year 1613\\", \\"Third Regiment of Portuguese Inquisition-year 1640\\". The Preachers chosen in the Courts of Holy Office were usually chosen in the newly created Orders: Dominican Friars, and Jesuits. Unlike the other Iberian kingdoms, Portugal was not much affected by the waves of riots. However, there, the Jews remaining on Portuguese soil were forcefully converted in 1497, after which New Christians became a numerous part of the population. New Christians, both Portuguese and Spanish, played an important role in LatinAmerica. They formed a considerable percentage of encomenderos and were among the first to capitalize on theexport of Cuban sugar.Yedida K. Stillman, George K. Zucker, \\"New Horizons in Sephardic Studies\\" University of New York Press (1997) pp112 Inquisition The governments of Spain and Portugal created the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 and the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536 as a way of dealing with social tensions, supposedly justified by the need to fight heresy.

It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about with a circuit of walls. The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century, including a basilica, temple and triumphal arch. Its prosperity, which was derived principally from olive growing, prompted the construction of many fine town-houses with large mosaic floors. The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and indefensibility on the south-western border of the Roman Empire. It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years, first as a Latinised Christian community, then as an early Islamic settlement. In the late 8th century it became the seat of Idris ibn Abdallah, the founder of the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco. By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes. Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, about from Volubilis. The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid-18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes. It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that the site was definitively identified as that of the ancient city of Volubilis. During and after the period of French rule over Morocco, about half of the site was excavated, revealing many fine mosaics, and some of the more prominent public buildings and high-status houses were restored or reconstructed. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed for being \\"an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire\\".  Name  The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Amazigh word Walilt, meaning oleander, which grows along the sides of the valley. The Lewis & Short Latin dictionary gives the Latin meaning of \\"volubilis\\" as \\"that [which] is turned round or (more freq.) that [which] turns itself round, turning, spinning, whirling, circling, rolling, revolving.\\" The word is mentioned in Horace's Epistles (I, 2, 43): (\\"It flows and will flow, swirling on forever.\\") In Classical Latin, the \\"v\\" in \\"volubilis\\" was pronounced like a \\"w,\\" making the pronunciation closer to modern Amazigh and Arabic pronunciations. (1828–1884) discovered that what some sources in Arabic referred to as \\"Qasr Fara'on\\" ( Pharaoh's Palace) corresponded with Volubilis. Foundation and Roman occupation Built on a shallow slope below the Zerhoun mountain, Volubilis stands on a ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Khuman) where it is met by a small tributary stream called the Fertassa. It overlooks a rolling fertile alluvial plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been inhabited at least since the Late Atlantic Neolithic, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia. By the third century BC, the Carthaginians had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language. The city lay within the kingdom of Mauretania, which became a Roman client state following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC. The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards, as the city's magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of suffete long after the end of Punic rule. Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a royal capital at Volubilis. Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II, the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings, although of Berber ancestry; their preference for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city's design. alt=Map of south-western Iberia and the far north-west of Africa with Roman roads and cities marked After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44 AD, the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity, derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain, olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles. At its peak in the late 2nd century, Volubilis had around 20,000 inhabitants – a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town – and the surrounding region was also well inhabited, to judge from over 50 villas discovered in the area. It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela, who described it in his work De situ orbis libri III as one of \\"the wealthiest cities, albeit the wealthiest among small ones\\" in Mauretania. It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as Volubilis Colonia. Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers. Arch of Caracalla (Triumphal Arch) The city remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40–44 AD led by one of Ptolemy's freedmen, Aedemon, and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten-year exemption from taxes. The city was raised to the status of a municipium and its system of governance was overhauled, with the Punic-style suffetes replaced by annually elected duumvirs, or pairs of magistrates. However, the city's position was always tenuous; it was located on the south-eastern edge of the province, facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes. A ring of five forts located at the modern hamlets of Aïn Schkor, Bled el Gaada, Sidi Moussa, Sidi Said and Bled Takourart (ancient Tocolosida) were constructed to bolster the city's defence. Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata, an auxiliary cavalry unit from Gaul, while Aïn Schkor housed Hispanic and Belgic cohorts. Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of Parthians, and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at Toscolosida. Rising tensions in the region near the end of the 2nd century led the emperor Marcus Aurelius to order the construction of a circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers. Volubilis was connected by road to Lixus and Tingis (capital city of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana, modern Tangier) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of Mauretania Caesariensis, as the territory of the Berber Baquates tribe lay in between. A Jewish community existed in Volubilis in the third century, as evident from several Hebrew, Greek and Latin funeral inscriptions and Menorah-shaped lamps. It is the most south-western location where ancient Hebrew inscription has been found. Mosaics in Volubilis Rome's control over the city ended following the chaos of the Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established. In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised what was left of the province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses. After the Romans Volubilis continued to be inhabited for centuries after the end of Roman control. It was certainly reoccupied in the sixth and seventh century, when three Christian inscriptions are dated by the provincial year. By the time the Arabs had arrived in 708, the city's name was changed to Oualila or Walīlī, and it was inhabited by the Awraba, a Berber tribe that originated in Libya. Much of the city centre had been abandoned and was turned into a cemetery, while the centre of habitation had moved to the southwest of the city, where a new wall was built to contain the abridged Roman town. Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period. Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site, attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco. They are concentrated outside the city walls, which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them. It was here that Moulay Idriss established the Idrisid dynasty of Morocco in 787-8. A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, he escaped to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of Fakhkh in 787. He was proclaimed \\"imam\\" in Volubilis, occupied by the Awraba, under Ishaq ibn Mohammad. He married Kanza, from the Awraba, and fathered a son, Idris II, who was proclaimed imam in Volubilis. He, too, lived outside the walls of the city, along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane, where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters. Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign, founding the city of Fes. He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid. On his majority Idriss II removed to Fes which served as his new capital, depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance. alt=Panoramic view of the ruins with fields in front and behind, and mountains in the distance. Several reconstructed buildings including a basilica and triumphal arch are visible. A Muslim group known as the Rabedis, who had revolted in Córdoba in Al-Andalus (Andalusia in modern Spain), resettled at Volubilis in 818. Although people continued to live in Volubilis for several more centuries, it was probably almost deserted by the 14th century. Leo Africanus describes its walls and gates, as well as the tomb of Idris, guarded only by two or three castles.Leo Africanus trad. A. Épaulard, I, p. 245 His body was subsequently removed to Moulay Idriss Zerhoun, , where a great mausoleum was built for it. The name of the city was forgotten and it was termed Ksar Faraoun, or the \\"Pharaoh's Castle\\", by the local people, alluding to a legend that the ancient Egyptians had built it. Nonetheless some of its buildings remained standing, albeit ruined, until as late as the 17th century when Moulay Ismail ransacked the site to provide building material for his new imperial capital at Meknes. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused further severe destruction. However, English antiquarian John Windus had sketched the site in 1722. In his 1725 book A Journey to Mequinez, Windus described the scene: Visiting 95 years later in 1820, after the Lisbon earthquake had flattened the few buildings left standing, James Gray Jackson wrote: File:Martiniere Volubilis arc de triomphe 1887.jpgalt=Photograph showing the fragmentary ruins of the triumphal arch in 1887The ruins of the triumphal arch, photographed in 1887 by Henri Poisson de La Martinière File:Martiniere Volubilis basilique 1887.jpgalt=Photograph showing a standing fragment of a wall of the basilica in 1887Remnants of the basilica as seen in 1887 before its later restoration Walter Burton Harris, a writer for The Times, visited Volubilis during his travels in Morocco between 1887–89, after the site had been identified by French archaeologists but before any serious excavations or restorations had begun. He wrote: Excavation, restoration and UNESCO listing Edge of the excavated area at Volubilis. A stretch of alt=View of an old narrow-gauge railway track running into an excavated area alongside walls and foundations Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1955, but the excavations at the site began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north-west Africa's pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites. The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it, \\"the Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign\\", which \\"gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty.\\" Emile Pauty of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines criticised the Muslims for taking the view that \\"the passage of time is nothing\\" and charged them with \\"let[ting] their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them.\\" The French programme of excavation at Volubilis and other sites in French-controlled North Africa (in Algeria and Tunisia) had a strong ideological component. Archaeology at Roman sites was used as an instrument of colonialist policy, to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new \\"Latin\\" societies that the French were building in North Africa. The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites, excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches. Ruined cities, such as Timgad in Algeria, were excavated and cleared on a massive scale. The remains were intended to serve, as one writer has put it, as \\"the witness to an impulse towards Romanization\\". This theme resonated with other visitors to the site. The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between \\"two dominations look[ing] at each other across the valley\\", the ruins of Volubilis and \\"the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco\\". She saw the dead city as representing \\"a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways.\\" In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as \\"more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome.\\" As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that \\"in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society\\". Fortunately for Morocco, \\"the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition\\"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. Hilaire Belloc, too, spoke of his impression being \\"rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition.\\" The first excavations at Volubilis were carried out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt. Following the war, excavations resumed under the French and Moroccan authorities (following Morocco's independence in 1955) and a programme of restoration and reconstruction began. The Arch of Caracalla had already been restored in 1930–34. It was followed by the Capitoline Temple in 1962, the basilica in 1965–67 and the Tingis Gate in 1967. A number of mosaics and houses underwent conservation and restoration in 1952–55. In recent years, one of the oil production workshops in the southern end of the city has been restored and furnished with a replica Roman oil press. These restorations have not been without controversy; a review carried out for UNESCO in 1997 reported that \\"some of the reconstructions, such as those on the triumphal arch, the capitolium, and the oil-pressing workshop, are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice.\\" From 2000 excavations carried out by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine under the direction of Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of the ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town.Reports on these excavations, as well as a detailed plan of the site, can be found at http://www.sitedevolubilis.org. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum. UNESCO listed Volubilis as a World Heritage Site in 1997. In the 1980s, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) organised three conferences to assess possible nominations to the World Heritage List for sites in North Africa. It was unanimously agreed that Volubilis was a good candidate for the list and in 1997 ICOMOS recommended that it be inscribed as \\"an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire\\", which UNESCO accepted. City layout and infrastructure Prior to the Roman occupation, Volubilis covered an area of about , built on a V-shaped ridge between the Fertassa and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north-south axis. It was developed on a fairly regular pattern typical of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements and was enclosed by a set of walls. Under the Romans, the city was expanded considerably on a northeast-southwest axis, increasing in size to about . Most of the city's public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city. The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part, behind the Decumanus Maximus (main street), which bisected the Roman-era part of the city. The decumanus was paved, with footways on either side, and was lined with arcaded porticoes on either sides, behind which were dozens of shops. The Arch of Caracalla marks the point at which the old and new cities merge. After the aqueduct fell into disrepair with the end of the Roman occupation, a new residential area was constructed to the west near the Wadi Khoumane. The city was supplied with water by an aqueduct that ran from a spring in the hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80 AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply and a series of drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.

The Roman city walls stretch for and average thick. Built of rubble masonry and ashlar, they are mostly still extant. The full circuit of walls had 34 towers, spaced at intervals of about one every , and six main gates that were flanked by towers. A part of the eastern wall has been reconstructed to a height of . The Tingis Gate, also reconstructed, marks the northern-eastern entrance to Volubilis. It was constructed in 168/169 AD – the date is known due to the discovery of a coin of that year that was deliberately embedded in the gate's stonework by its builders. An early medieval wall stands to the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, apparently some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city. =Commerce= A reconstructed Roman olive press in Volubilis During Roman times, Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central to the life of the city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks. Notable buildings Plan of Volubilis, indicating some of the most notable buildings Although only about half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of prominent public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings. A large tumulus of uncertain origin and purpose stands approximately in the middle of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses. =Public buildings= Two major public buildings are readily visible at the centre of the city – the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century, it is one of the finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya. The building is long by wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain. Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century, as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures. The Capitoline Temple stands behind the basilica within what would originally have been an arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps leading up to the Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus. There were five other temples in the city, of which the most notable is the so-called \\"Temple of Saturn\\" that stood on the eastern side of Volubilis. It appears to have been built on top of, or converted from, an earlier Punic temple, which may have been dedicated to Baal. It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three- sided portico. In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium. The temple's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted.

Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of Gallienus, redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city's most lavish baths. The nearby north baths were the largest in the city, covering an area of about . They were possibly built in the time of Hadrian. =Triumphal arch= The Arch of Caracalla is one of Volubilis' most distinctive sights, situated at the end of the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper. The arch is constructed from local stone and was originally topped by a bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins at the foot of the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.

The city's considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy, some of which have large mosaics still in situ. They have been named by archaeologists after their principal mosaics (or other finds): * The House of Orpheus in the southern part of the city thus takes its name from the large Orpheus mosaic, showing the god playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal. * The House of the Athlete or Desultor, located near the forum, contains a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand. It may possibly represent Silenus. The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus, behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade. They were entered from side streets between the shops. * The House of the Ephebe was named after a bronze statue found there. It has a prominent interior courtyard leading to a number of public rooms decorated with mosaics, including a depiction of Bacchus in a chariot being drawn by leopards. * The House of the Knight next door also has a mosaic of Bacchus, this time shown coming across the sleeping Ariadne, who later bore him six children. The house takes its name from a bronze statue of a rider found here in 1918 that is now on display in the archaeological museum in Rabat. It was a large building, with an area of about , and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including eight or nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive-pressing complex.

It is thought to have been created during the reign of the emperor Commodus, who identified himself with Hercules. Jupiter, his lover Ganymede and the four seasons are depicted in another mosaic in the house. The house was of palatial size, with 41 rooms covering an area of . * A building dubbed the Gordian Palace is located further up the Decumanus Maximus. It was the largest building in the city and was probably the residence of the governor, rather than the emperor Gordian III; it was rebuilt during Gordian's reign in the mid-3rd century. It combined two separate houses to create a complex of 74 rooms with courtyards and private bathhouses serving both domestic and official functions. It also incorporated a colonnaded front with a dozen shops behind the colonnade, and an oil factory consisting of three oil presses and an oil store in the north- east corner of the complex. The decoration of the Gordian Palace is today quite plain with only a few scanty mosaics remaining. Despite its presumed high status, the floors seem to have been mostly rendered with opus sectile rather than decorated with mosaics. Inscriptions found in the palace testify to the city's decline and eventual fall. They record a series of treaties reached with the local Berber chieftains, increasing in number as the city became more vulnerable and the tribesmen pressed harder. By the time of the final treaty, just a few years before the fall of the city, the chieftains were being treated as virtual equals of Rome – an indication of how much Roman power in the area had declined. The last two inscribed altars, from 277 and 280, refer to a foederata et diuturna pax (a \\"federated and lasting peace\\"), though this proved to be a forlorn hope, as Volubilis fell soon afterwards. * The House of Venus, towards the eastern side of the city under a prominent cypress tree, was one of the most luxurious residences in the city. It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior, with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes. There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms. The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome, drawn by teams of peacocks, geese and ducks. The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier, but in the next-door room is a still-extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing. Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag, before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs. The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city's fall around 280; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it, perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth. The same building was also the site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made at the same time as the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal. =Headquarters of Idris I= Just outside the walls of the city, on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule at the corner of the building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters .

They criticized the bland, simplistic graphics, shortage of sound effects, repetitive music, and the lack of variety in the gameplay of the different events. Bruised Lee remarked that the Genesis version was even worse than the Super NES one. A reviewer for Next Generation contended that \\"Although buried behind substandard graphics (even for 16-bit standards), Olympic Summer Games features the multiple player gameplay that made Track and Field so popular.\\" He described the gameplay's demand for a combination of intense button pounding and precise timing to be both an effective challenge and a traditionally fun experience, and scored the Super NES version three out of five stars. Next Generation gave the 3DO version three out of five stars as well. The reviewer again praised the combination of button mashing and timing, and noted that while the graphics do not measure up to International Track & Field or DecAthlete, those two games would not have been able to run on the 3DO without significant compromises. Reviewing the Game Boy version in GamePro, Coach Kyle praised the graphics and animation, but criticized the sound effects and said the gameplay was uninvolving. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the PlayStation version 6.0 and 6.5 out of 10, complaining of low frame rates and a lack of lasting appeal.

Taxonomy Levaillant's woodpecker is sometimes considered a subspecies of the European green woodpecker. It is monotypic, meaning it has no subspecies. This species was named in honour of the French explorer, collector and ornithologist, François Le Vaillant. Distribution and habitat Levaillant's woodpecker is found in the three Maghreb countries Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in northwest Africa. It breeds in mountain forests up to the treeline at around 2000m. Description Levaillant's woodpecker is 30–33 cm in length with a 45–51 cm wingspan. It is very similar to the European green woodpecker, especially females of the Iberian race P. v. sharpei. Levaillant's woodpecker is dark green above and yellowish green below, with a crimson nape. The black moustache has a pale border above. The rump is chrome yellow and the outer webs of the primaries are barred black and white. The bill and feet are slate grey. Sexes are similar except that the male has a crimson crown, whereas the female's crown is grey. Like .P. v. sharpei, both sexes lack the black on the lores and around the eye shown by most forms of the green woodpecker. The call is a loud ringing laugh, plue, plue, plue, very like the green woodpecker's yaffle, but perhaps slightly faster. Behaviour This woodpecker's insect food is captured by a rapid outward flick of the long tongue, and gummed to its tip by sticky saliva. Though a large and heavy bird it has an easy, bounding flight. The nest is a hole in a tree, and 4-8 glossy white eggs are laid on wood chips.

Space guns could thus potentially provide a method of non-rocket spacelaunch. It has been conjectured that space guns could place satellites into Earth's orbit (although after-launch propulsion of the satellite would be necessary to achieve a stable orbit), and could also launch spacecraft beyond Earth's gravitational pull and into other parts of the Solar System by exceeding Earth's escape velocity of about . However, these speeds are too far into the hypersonic range for most practical propulsion systems and also would cause most objects to burn up due to aerodynamic heating or be torn apart by aerodynamic drag. Therefore, a more likely future use of space guns would be to launch objects into near Earth orbit, from where attached rockets could be fired or the objects could be \\"collected\\" by maneuverable orbiting satellites. In Project HARP, a 1960s joint United States and Canada defence project, a U.S. Navy 100 caliber gun was used to fire a projectile at , reaching an apogee of , hence performing a suborbital spaceflight. However, a space gun has never been successfully used to launch an object into orbit or out of Earth's gravitational pull.  Technical issues  The large g-force likely to be experienced by a ballistic projectile launched in this manner would mean that a space gun would be incapable of safely launching humans or delicate instruments, rather being restricted to freight, fuel or ruggedized satellites. =Getting to orbit= A space gun by itself is not capable of placing objects into stable orbit around the object (planet or otherwise) from which it launches them. The orbit is a parabolic orbit, a hyperbolic orbit, or part of an elliptic orbit which ends at the planet's surface at the point of launch or another point. This means that an uncorrected ballistic payload will always strike the planet within its first orbit unless the velocity was so high as to reach or exceed escape velocity. As a result, all payloads intended to reach a closed orbit need at least to perform some sort of course correction to create another orbit that does not intersect the planet's surface. A rocket can be used for additional boost, as planned in both Project HARP and the Quicklaunch project. The magnitude of such correction may be small; for instance, the StarTram Generation 1 reference design involves a total of of rocket burn to raise perigee well above the atmosphere when entering an low Earth orbit. In a three-body or larger system, a gravity assist trajectory might be available such that a carefully aimed escape velocity projectile would have its trajectory modified by the gravitational fields of other bodies in the system such that the projectile would eventually return to orbit the initial planet using only the launch delta-v. Isaac Newton avoided this objection in his thought experiment by positing an impossibly tall mountain from which his cannon was fired. If in a stable orbit, the projectile would circle the planet and return to the altitude of launch after one orbit (see Newton's cannonball). = Acceleration = For a space gun with a gun barrel of length (l), and the needed velocity (v_e), the acceleration (a) is provided by the following formula: : a = frac{v_e^2}{2l} For instance, with a space gun with a vertical \\"gun barrel\\" through both the Earth's crust and the troposphere, totalling ~ of length (l), and a velocity (v_e) enough to escape the Earth's gravity (escape velocity, which is on Earth), the acceleration (a) would theoretically be more than , which is more than 100 g-forces, which is about 3 times the human tolerance to g-forces of maximum 20 to 35 g during the ~10 seconds such a firing would take. Practical attempts Two sections of the Project Babylon gun Project HARP, a prototype of a space gun. The German V-3 cannon program (less well known than the V-2 rocket or V-1 flying bomb), during the Second World War was an attempt to build something approaching a space gun. Based in the Pas-de-Calais area of France it was planned to be more devastating than the other Nazi 'Vengeance weapons'. The cannon was capable of launching , diameter shells over a distance of . It was destroyed by RAF bombing using Tallboy blockbuster bombs in July 1944. The V-3 cannon used staged propulsion, which gave it a far greater range. =Project Babylon= The most prominent recent attempt to make a space gun was artillery engineer Gerald Bull's Project Babylon, which was also known as the 'Iraqi supergun' by the media. During Project Babylon, Bull used his experience from Project HARP to build a massive cannon for Saddam Hussein, leader of Ba'athist Iraq. Bull was assassinated before the project was completed.William Lowther, Arms and the Man: Dr. Gerald Bull, Iraq, and the Supergun (Presidio, Novato, 1991) = Super High Altitude Research Project = Since Bull's death, few have seriously attempted to build a space gun. Perhaps most promisingly, the US Ballistic Missile Defense program sponsored the Super High Altitude Research Project (SHARP) in the 1980s. Developed at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, it is a light-gas gun and has been used to test fire objects at Mach 9. = Quicklaunch = After cancellation of SHARP, lead developers John Hunter founded the Jules Verne Launcher Company in 1996 and the Quicklaunch company. As of September 2012, Quicklaunch was seeking to raise $500 million to build a gun that could refuel a propellant depot or send bulk materials into space. Ram accelerators have also been proposed as an alternative to light-gas guns. Other proposals use electromagnetic techniques for accelerating the payload, such as coilguns and railguns. In fiction The firing of a space gun in Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon The first publication of the concept may be Newton's cannonball in the 1728 book A Treatise of the System of the World, although it was primarily used as a thought experiment regarding gravity.vectorsite.net > [4.0 Space Guns] v1.1.4 / chapter 4 of 7 / 01 jun 08 / greg goebel / public domain Perhaps the most famous representation of a space gun is in Jules Verne's novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon (loosely interpreted into the early film Le Voyage dans la Lune), in which astronauts fly to the moon aboard a ship launched from a cannon. Another famous example is used by the Martians to launch their invasion in H. G. Wells' book The War of the Worlds. Wells also used the concept in the climax of the 1936 movie Things to Come. The device was featured in films as late as 1967, such as Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon. In the video game Ultima: Worlds of Adventure 2: Martian Dreams, Percival Lowell builds a space gun to send a spacecraft to Mars. The video game Steel Empire, a shoot 'em up with steampunk aesthetics, features a space gun in its seventh level that is used by the main villain General Styron to launch himself to the Moon. In Hannu Rajaniemi's 2012 novel The Fractal Prince, a space gun at the \\"Jannah-of-the-cannon\\", powered by a 150-kiloton nuclear bomb, is used to launch a spaceship from Earth. The 2015 video game SOMA features a space gun used to launch satellites. Gerald Bull's assassination and the Project Babylon gun were also the starting point for Frederick Forsyth's 1994 novel The Fist of God. In Larry Bond's 2001 novella and 2015 novel Lash-Up, China uses a space gun to destroy American GPS satellites. In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, a village of Bob-ombs operates a space gun to send Paper Mario and company to the X-Naut's base on the moon. Gerald Bull and Project Babylon are integral to the plot of Louise Penny's novel The Nature of the Beast.

Life Born as Maudie Cecilia Acklin in Baxter County, Arkansas, she married William M. Cantrell (aged 86) on February 2, 1934, when she was 19. Cantrell had enlisted in the Confederate States Army at age 16 in Pikeville, Kentucky, and served in General Samuel G. French's Battalion of Virginia Infantry. He was captured in 1863, and was part of a prisoner exchange. He had a previous wife, who had died in 1929. Cantrell supported her with a pension of US$25 every two or three months, and she inherited his home in 1937. She received no further pension benefits after his death. She remarried later in 1937, and twice thereafter, and had three children. It was not especially uncommon for young women in Arkansas to marry Confederate pensioners; in 1937 the state passed a law stating that women who married Civil War veterans would not be eligible for a widow's pension. The law was later changed in 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions. Hopkins generally kept her first marriage a secret, fearing that the resulting gossip (of marrying a much older man) would damage her reputation. After researching records from Arkansas and United States Census Bureau data, Hopkins was certified by various historical organizations, most notably the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A spokeswoman for the UDC, Martha Boltz, has said that there may be two other widows, one in Tennessee and another in North Carolina, but if they are still alive, they choose to remain in anonymity.

Industrial civilization refers to the state of civilization following the Industrial Revolution, characterised by widespread use of powered machines.

Individual regions may specialise further as the civilisation continues to advance, resulting in some regions transitioning to a service economy, or information society, or post-industrial society (these are still dependent on industry, but allow individuals to move out of manufacturing jobs). The present era is sometimes referred to as the Information Age . De- industrialization of a region may occur for a range of reasons. Industrial civilization has allowed a significant growth both in world population, thanks to mechanised agriculture and advances in modern medicine, and in the standard of living.

His primary campaign was against his own tribe in Mecca, the Quraysh. Muhammad proclaimed prophethood around 610 and later migrated to Medina after being persecuted by the Quraysh in 622. After several battles against the Quraysh, Muhammad conquered Mecca in 629, ending his campaign against the tribe. Alongside his campaign against the Quraysh, Muhammad led campaigns against several other tribes of Arabia, most notably the three Arabian Jewish tribes of Medina and the Jewish fortress at Khaybar. He expelled the Banu Qaynuqa tribe for violating the Constitution of Medina in 624, followed by the Banu Nadir who were expelled in May 625 after being accused of plotting to assassinate him. In early 627, he ordered the execution of all men and one woman of the Banu Qurayza tribe, who secretly made agreements with the Quraysh and their allies as they laid siege to Medina in the Battle of the Trench, violating the Constitution of Medina. Finally, in 628, he besieged and invaded the Jewish fortress of Khaybar, which hosted more than 10,000 Jews, which Muslims sources say was retaliation for planning to ally themselves with the local Arab pagan tribes.In the final years of his life, Muhammad sent several armies against the Byzantine Empire and the Ghassanids in northern Arabia and the Levant, before conquering Mecca in 630 and leading a campaign against some Arab pagan tribes close to Mecca, most notably in Ta'if. The last army led by Muhammad before his death was in the Battle of Tabuk in October 630. By his death in 632, Muhammad had managed to unite most of the Arabian Peninsula, laying the foundation for the subsequent Islamic expansion under the caliphates and defining Islamic military jurisprudence.  Background  = Muhammad's role in The Sacrilegious Wars = In his prophetic biography () titled The Sealed Nectar (), Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri cites Ibn Hisham in saying that Muhammad took part in the Sacrilegious Wars, which took place between an alliance of the Quraysh and the Kinanah and the Qais 'Ailan, when he was 15, saying that \\"his efforts were confined to picking up the arrows of the enemy as they fell, and handing them over to his uncles.\\" = Events before the Hijra = Muhammad proclaimed prophethood (nubuwwah) at the age of 40 to his tribe, the Quraysh, in Mecca. After his followers were persecuted by the Quraysh, Muhammad ordered them to move to Abyssinia to seek refuge in 615, where they were welcomed with open arms. After the death of his uncle Abu Talib in 619, Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, was lacking someone who provided him security in an increasingly hostile environment in Mecca. After several failed attempts to reach for tribes outside of Mecca, he contacted the Khazraj of Medina (then Yathrib). Six of them converted to Islam. In Medina they spread the word of Muhammad and Islam and in February 621, a new delegation reached Mecca, among them two members of the Aws. The Khazraj and Aws were rivals at this time, fighting for control of Medina. Muhammad mediated a ceasefire between the two parties and sent them back to Medina, accompanied by a reciter of the Quran. Islam slowly grew in Medina before in March 622, a new delegation, this time numbering 72 people, consulted with Muhammad. They pledged their readiness to wage war against Muhammad's enemies, while Muhammad also declared his readiness to wage war against the Jews of Medina. The Meccans, who heard rumours of this meeting and realized that this was a call to war, failed an attempt to assassinate Muhammad in May 622. Muhammad fled, together with his companion Abu Bakr, to Medina, in what is known as the Hijra. alt= = Situation in Medina = Medina was divided into five tribes: two of them the Khazraj and Aws, while the Jews were represented by, from smallest to largest, the Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir and Banu Quraizah. Upon his arrival in Medina, Muhammad set about the establishment of a pact known as the Constitution of Medina, to regulate the matters of governance of the city, as well as the extent and nature of inter- community relations, and signatories to it included the Muslims, the Ansar and the Jewish tribes of Medina.Ibn Hisham, as-Seerat an-Nabawiyyah, Vol. I p. 501. Significant clauses of the constitution included the mutual assistance of each other if one signatory were to be attacked by a third party, the resolution that the Muslims would profess their religion and the Jews theirs, as well as the appointment of Muhammad as the leader of the state.al- Mubarakpuri (2002) p. 230. History = Campaign against the Quraysh =  Caravan raids prior to Badr  Muhammad and his companions soon engaged in a series of caravan raids. These raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of caravans financed by the Quraysh (such retaliation was explained as being legitimate by saying many Muslims' possessions and wealth, left behind when they migrated from Mecca, were stolen).. The Muslims declared that the raids were justified and that God gave them permission to defend against the Meccans' persecution of Muslims.Welch, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of Islam.See: * Watt (1964) p. 76; * Peters (1999) p. 172 * Michael Cook, Muhammad. In Founders of Faith, Oxford University Press, 1986, page 309. Another reason for the raids appears to have been economic stress, as the food output of Medina was barely capable of feeding the Muslim newcomers. Hence, the raiding of food was mandatory to supplement their diet. The order of the caravan raids is somewhat confused in the Islamic sources. What seems clear is that there were two types of raids: those led by Muhammad and those led by lieutenants. They featured somewhere between seven and 200 warriors, typically on foot, but occasionally horse riders. These fighters were, at least initially, provided almost exclusively by the Muhajirun, the Muslim migrants from Mecca. Consisting primarily of unemployed young men, they had the chance to place their name in a register if desiring to go on a raid. The first year of these raids was a \\"near total failure\\". All Meccan caravans managed to evade Muhammad's forces or were accompanied by forces with superior numbers, suggesting that the Quraish relied on a spy among the core of the Muslim community. Aware of this problem, Muhammad introduced the usage of sealed letters of instructions and appointed 'Abdullah ibn Jahsh to lead an expedition of eight or twelve men. After marching for two days, Ibn Jahsh opened the letter to learn that, according to most sources, he was instructed to gain intelligence information about the movement of Meccan caravans deep in Quraish territory, in Nakhlah, near modern-day Rabigh. Soon the expedition met a Meccan caravan, weakly protected by only four guards. The Muslims encountered the caravan in a holy month where fighting was forbidden, and it also seems that Muhammad did not order the usage of violence. Despite this, the Muslim warriors collectively decided to attack and approached the caravan disguised as pilgrims. When close enough they leaped upon the guards: one of whom escaped, two were seized and one was killed. The victim, named Amr ibn al-Hadrami, was the first person killed for the cause of Islam. Ibn Jahsh and his men returned to Medina with the seized caravan, which carried wine, leather goods and raisins.  Battle of Badr  Map showing the movements of the Meccan caravan, the Muslim army and the Meccan relief army On 13 March 624 (17 Ramadan 2 AH), Muhammad faced the Meccans in the first pitched battle, the Battle of Badr. The prelude revolved around Muhammad's plan to raid a major Meccan caravan which was on its way from Syria to Mecca. It was of monumental size, comprising 1000 camels transporting tens of thousands of dinars, and was escorted by 70 horsemen. Attacking this caravan would have forced Mecca into action, as virtually every Qurayshi family had invested in it. Despite this risk, Muhammad began the preparations before finally setting out on 9 December 623, with a force of around 313-317 men, 70 camels and two horses. Muhammad and his warriors marched offside the common roads to avoid Meccan scouts, passing through little-known canyons and wadis. The Qurayshi leader of the caravan, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, who accompanied the caravan and realized that Muslim scouts were nearby, ordered the caravan to take a different route and sent a messenger to Mecca. After the latter arrived in Mecca and told the Quraysh that a Muslim attack was imminent, a Meccan relief force of more than 1000 men, many of them wearing chainmail armour, was sent. Amr ibn Hisham, who was later given the kunya Abu Jahl by Muhammad, who led the relief army, pressed northwards to where he expected the Muslim army to be: at Badr. While marching, however, around 200–400 warriors left his army and headed back to Mecca. 14th century illustration of the angelic intervention at Badr Muhammad was unaware of the Meccan army until one day before contact, when his men captured two Qurayshi waterbearers. The Muslims took up a defensive position. The battle started off with a duel between three Muslim and three Meccan champions, which the Muslims decided in their favour. Afterwards the two armies exchanged arrow fire, before finally clashing. According to the Quran, thousands of angels descended from heaven and participated in the battle, being instructed by Allah to \\"smite the [Meccan warriors'] necks and smite of them each finger.\\" According to another Quranic verse, Allah fought and killed the Meccans representatively for the Muslim warriors. The Meccan army eventually collapsed soon after the horse of Abu Jahl was brought down, resulting in the first major Muslim victory. This victory must not so much be ascribed to divine intervention as is done in the Islamic sources, but had several conventional reasons, like the Meccan inability to use their cavalry, the questioned leadership of Abu Jahl, the Meccan lack of access to water and the higher morale of the Muslims. The battle took the lives of 14 Muslims, while the Meccan casualties numbered between 50 and 70. A similar number of them were captured and were either executed or kept for ransom. Amr ibn Hisham survived the battle, but with mortal injuries. A Muslim warrior found him, decapitated him and presented his head to Muhammad. Many more noblemen of the Quraysh had died in the fighting, which posed a significant blow to the Quraysh. Muhammad thought about pursuing the Meccan caravan, but then decided to return to Medina instead.  'Battle of Uhud  'In December 624 CE (Shawwal 3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, now the de facto leader of Mecca, marched upon Medina with an army of 3,000 men to avenge the losses at Badr. Learning of his movement toward Medina, Muhammad held a council of war at Medina to debate whether to fight from inside the walls of Medina or to go out and face the Meccan army. After he reached a consensus between the Ansar and the Muhajirun to meet the enemy outside the walls of the city, Muhammad marched with a 1,000-strong army toward the mountain of Uhud. Map showing the placement of troops in the Battle of UhudAs the Muslim army approached Uhud, 300 of them withdrew under 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy, leaving the Muslims numbering around 700. The battle was the first defensive battle in which Muhammad took part. Muhammad anticipated the Quraysh to try to encircle the Muslims from around a small mount to the south of Uhud, and thus, placed 50 archers on the small mountain, now called Jabal ar-Rumma (Mount of the Archers), to protect the Muslims' left flank. Mount Uhud Seeing that the Muslims were gaining the initiative early in the battle, around 40 of the archers disobeyed Muhammad's commands and climbed down the hill to collect the spoils of war. Khalid ibn al-Walid, who was still not a Muslim then and was a commander of the right cavalry flank of the Meccans, exploited this mistake and tried to encircle the Muslims, which led to the slaughter of most of those who had climbed down. Seeing that his army had now been encircled, Muhammad himself entered the battlefield and started to fight to save the Muslims, but he got injured on his shoulder and his lower right tooth was broken. Many see the Battle of Uhud as a stalemate between the Meccans and the Muslims as the Meccans had achieved a tactical victory as their main objective was to avenge their losses at Badr, and they had killed and equal number of Muslims to that of the Meccans at Badr; but they failed to exploit their advantage and invade Medina. Muhammad lost his uncle, Hamza ibn Abdul- Muttalib, in the battle. Battle of the Trench Map showing the geological features of Medina in context of the Battle of the TrenchIn December 626, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb led a confederate army of the Quraysh, the Banu Kinanah, the Ghatafan and the Banu Nadir, the exiled Jewish tribe from Medina, numbering around 10,000, to besiege Medina. Muhammad was able to prepare a force of about 3,000 men, and held another council of war to decide the course of action. Adopting a new form of defence, unknown in Arabia at that time, Muslims dug trenches wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman al-Farsi. The digging of the trench began on Monday, 29 December 626 (5 Shawwal AH 5) and took six days. On Saturday 3 January 627 (10 Shawwal 5 AH), the confederates encamped and Muhammad rode out at the head of his army to confront them. The siege lasted twenty nights, until the early morning of Saturday, 24 January (1 Dhu al- Qa'dah), not two weeks as claimed by Watt.Watt (1956), p. 36, 37. Watt's date of 14 April for the end of the siege is also incorrect, being according to the fixed calendar which was not introduced for another five years. Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications they were confronted with, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to go home.Rodinson (2002), pp. 209–211. The campaign lasted 27 days. The immediate cause was harsh winter weather, making the mid-April date inconceivable. The Qur'an discusses this battle in verses 9-27 of surah 33, Al-Ahzab.Uri Rubin, Quraysh, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Treaty of Hudaybiyyah According to traditional Arabian customs, during the months of pilgrimage and the sacred months, tribal hostilities stopped and all were free to visit Mecca. In March 628, Muhammad put on the ihram and led a contingent of Muslims and camels for sacrifice toward Mecca intending to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. According to the early chronicler Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad took 700 men. According to Watt, Muhammad took 1400 to 1600 men. The Meccans did not accept the Muslim professions of peaceful intent and sent out an armed party against them. The Muslims evaded them by taking an unconventional route through the hills around Mecca, and then camped outside Mecca, at Hudaybiyyah. Ibn Ishaq describes a tense period of embassies and counter-embassies, including a bold foray by the future caliph, 'Uthman ibn Affan, into the city of Mecca, where he was temporarily held as a hostage. The Meccans told the Muslims that 'Uthman had been killed and open warfare seemed imminent. After it was revealed that 'Uthman was alive, the Meccans expressed their willingness to negotiate a truce. Some elements wanted a confrontation, but Muhammad held out for a peaceful resolution. The treaty of Hudaybiyyah committed both sides and their allies to a ten-year truce. The Muslims were to be allowed to return the next year, to perform the pilgrimage. Conquest of Mecca Early 19th century manuscript showing the Muslim army marching into Mecca and the subsequent smashing of its idols. Less than two years after the truce of Hudaybiyyah, the truce was broken by the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraysh, who attacked the Banū Khuzaʽah, allies of the Muslims. According to Watt, Some of the Quraysh helped the Banu Bakr ambush the Khuza'ah. Muhammad gave the Meccans a chance to offer blood-money in retaliation, but they were unwilling to do so. Shortly afterwards, Muhammad secretly led a Muslim force of 10,000 men and headed for Mecca. They camped outside Mecca and the usual round of emissaries and negotiations began. Apparently Abu Sufyan had negotiated, then or earlier, a promise that he and those under him would not be attacked if they surrendered peacefully. A few Meccans from the Makhzum faction, prepared to resist. On or near 11 January 630, Muhammad sent multiple columns of troops into Mecca. Only one column met any resistance. 28 Meccans were killed and the rest of those opposing the Muslim entry fled. The remaining Meccans surrendered to Muhammad. Some of the Meccans, even those who had been notable for their opposition to Islam, were spared.The Message by Ayatullah Ja'far Subhani, chapter 48 referencing Sirah by Ibn Hisham, vol. II, page 409. The Kaaba was cleansed of all the idols of Arabian gods, such as Hubal, which were placed in it and the area was established as a Muslim sanctuary. While destroying each idol, Muhammad recited verse 81 of Surah 17:Islam, iconography and the Taliban Conquest of Makkah - USC MSA > \\"And say: Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away. Lo! falsehood is > ever bound to vanish.\\" However, according to one Shia tradition, he ordered an iconography of the virgin Mary and baby Jesus which was in the Kaaba not to be destroyed.{http://www.bliis.org/essay/prophet-muhammad-jesus-marys-icons- kaba/} = Campaign against the Jews of Medina =  Expulsion of the Banu Qaynuqa'  In April 624, after the Battle of Badr, the Banu Qaynuqa violated the Constitution of Medina by shaming a Muslim woman by pinning and tearing her clothes. A Muslim man who witnessed this, killed the Jewish man responsible for it in retaliation. The Jews came in group against the Muslim and killed him. After a successive chain of similar revenge killings, enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa', which led Muhammad to lay siege to their fortress. The Qaynuqa' had a strength of around 700. After being besieged for 14-15 days, the tribe eventually surrendered to Muhammad, who initially wanted to capture the men of Banu Qaynuqa', but ultimately yielded to Abdullah ibn 'Ubayy and agreed to expel the Qaynuqa'. The tribe eventually went northward toward Der'aa in modern-day Syria and assimilated themselves into the local Jewish population. Jami' at-Tawareekh () showing the submission of the Banu Nadir to Muhammad  Expulsion of the Banu Nadir  The Prophet, Ali, and the Companions at the execution of the Prisoners of the Jewish Tribe of Beni Qurayzah\\" In May 625, Muhammad laid siege to the Banu Nadir, after they were accused of plotting to assassinate him. The siege is said to have lasted anywhere between six and fifteen days. Enjoying their strategic advantage due to the thick foliage of palm trees surrounding their castles, the Banu Nadir pelted the Muslims with stones and showered arrows upon them from their castles. In response, Muhammad is said to have commanded the burning of the palm trees. The tribe eventually surrendered and was expelled, moving northward toward Khaybar, another Jewish fort city around 150 km (95 mi) north of Medina and was captured again during the Battle of Khaybar. They were allowed to live around Khaybar until the Rashidun caliph, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, expelled them for a second time.  Invasion of the Banu Qurayza  During the Battle of the Trench in December 626 and January 627, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, whose forts were located in southern Medina, were caught conspiring to ally themselves with the confederates and were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged their forts, and they were the last of the Jewish tribes of Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men and one woman were beheaded, apart from a few who converted to Islam, while all the other women and children were enslaved.Peterson, Muhammad: the prophet of God, p. 126Tariq Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, Oxford University Press, p. 141 In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, western historians and biographers have explained it as \\"the punishment of the Medinan Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old.\\"Francis Edward Peters (2003), p. 77 Francis Edward Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad.F.E.Peters (2003), pp. 76–8. Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was \\"quite extraordinary\\" and is \\"quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina.\\"Francis Edward Peters (2003), p. 194. According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis.Alford Welch, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of Islam Siege of Khaybar Aerial view of the deserted homes in Khaybar In March 628, according to Muslims sources, the Jews of Khaybar, along with the Banu Nadir, who were exiled from Medina by Muhammad for violating the Constitution of Medina, and the Banu Ghatafan, were planning to attack the Muslims. When Muhammad learned of their alliance, he gathered an army of 1,500 soldiers and besieged the Jewish fortress at Khaybar. Scottish historian and orientalist, William Montgomery Watt agrees with this view. Italian orientalist Laura Veccia Vaglieri claims other motives pushed Muhammad to invade the forts of Khaybar. On the other side, the Banu Ghatafan were afraid that the Muslims would attack them at any time, so they refused to help the Jews at Khaybar. After capturing six of the eight Jewish forts in Medina, the Jews of Khaybar finally surrendered and were allowed to live in the oasis on the condition that they would give one-half of their produce to the Muslims. Two Jewish commanders were killed in the siege. They continued to live in the oasis for several more years until they were expelled by caliph 'Umar ibn al- Khattab. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the Islamic law for the jizya.16th century illustration of Muhammad (depicted as veiled and surrounded by flames) supervising the Battle of Uhud = Byzantine campaign = In the final years of his life, after suppressing the two main factions that were leading in the opposition against him; the Meccans and the Jews, Muhammad led an active campaign against the main force in the north, the Byzantine Empire, which was involved in several wars against the Sasanian Empire, known as the Roman–Persian Wars. Following a defeat in the Battle of Mu'tah in Muhammad's campaign against the Byzantine began with the final expedition led by Muhammad himself, the Tabuk expedition, which is also known as the Usra expedition. Muhammad heard of the gathering of a large Byzantine–Ghassanid alliance against the Muslims in Tabuk and led a force of some 30,000 men to look for them. After waiting and scouting for the enemy for twenty days, Muhammad returned to Medina. Statistics The total of all casualties on all sides in all the battles of Muhammad might be, more or less, 1000. A contemporary Islamic scholar, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, says that \\"during the 23-years in which this revolution was completed, 80 military expeditions took place. Fewer than 20 expeditions actually involved any fighting. 259 Muslims and 759 non- Muslims died in these battles – a total of 1018 dead.\\"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, Muhammad: A Prophet for All Humanity, goodword (2000), p. 132  Legacy  Javed Ahmed Ghamidi writes in Mizan that there are certain directives of the Qur’an pertaining to war which were specific only to Muhammad against divinely-specified peoples of his times (the polytheists and the Israelites and Nazarites of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of divine punishment—for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by Allah through Muhammad, and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for military protection as the dhimmis of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam, hence now, the only valid reason for war is to end oppression when all other measures have failed or, jihad.Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, Mizan, Chapter:The Islamic Law of Jihad, Dar ul-Ishraq, 2001.

The ASP is a custom made handgun designed and built by Paris Theodore (owner of Seventrees, Ltd., a custom gun leather shop in New York City) from the early 1970s to 1987. The ASP was based on the Smith & Wesson Model 39 pistol. The ASP featured clear Lexan grips allowing the shooter to see how much ammunition is left, a rounded hammer, hooked triggerguard and no front sight. The ASP was responsible for later innovations made in the development of concealable handguns. Background The ASP was a reworked Smith & Wesson Model 39 or 39-2, employing a shortened slide; a fixed bushing (in lieu of the Smith & Wesson designed collet bushing); the unique Guttersnipe sight system; clear Lexan grip-panels; a fully ramped and throated, shortened barrel; and a smoothed and radiused profile to ensure no risk of snagging on the draw. The fixed bushing was tightly fitted to the shortened barrel and dry-lubricated by Teflon-S, which was applied to all components of the pistol, with the exception of the clear Lexan grip panels. This coating is somewhat more durable than the more typical Teflon formulations used in cooking appliances and utensils. The unique sighting system, referred to as the \\"Guttersnipe\\", was a narrowing U-channel with fluorescent yellow panels that would form three triangles, all pointed at the target when the sight was properly aligned. Checkering was kept to a minimum, and reserved for the frontstrap and backstrap, as opposed to the grip panels, which were smooth to prevent the drawing hand from catching prematurely on draw, thereby minimizing the risk of any misalignment of the pistol during presentation, aiming, and firing. The ASP 9 mm handgun was made in either right-handed, or left-handed models, as the extended trigger guard (which included a recurved hook for the index finger of the supporting hand -- one of the earliest known instances of such a feature) was cut away on the side of the strong-sided hand (which would depend on the handedness of the individual using the pistol). Included with the gun was a patented double magazine pouch which used a magnet to hold the spare magazines in place. The cost for the complete ASP modification package on a customer-supplied handgun was $475, and was done by a subsidiary company, Armament Systems and Procedures, Inc.. Production of holsters and magazine carriers for the ASP 9 mm were contracted out to Ken Null, who still produces those designs. Theodore ceased production of the ASP in 1987. Devel pistol In 1976 a gunsmith from Cleveland, Ohio named Charles Kelsey ordered an ASP pistol and never received one. His experience led him to develop an improved version of the ASP. Working with Firearms Instructor Ken Hackathorn, he developed the Devel pistol. The wood grips featured a clear lexan insert, allowing the shooter a visual account of the number of rounds in the magazine. The pistols were coated in an electroless nickel finish and featured traditional sights. Kelsey sent a sample gun to Smith & Wesson, for a factory agreement to produce these pistols on a large scale. An agreement was never reached, yet several of Kelsey's improvements were incorporated into the S&W; 3913. Unique to this pistol, Guttersnipe Iron sights become narrower from back to front, painted in bright yellow for faster target acquisition. Cultural presence This pistol is a playable weapon in Call of Duty: Black Ops.

The founders were unable to finance the constructions so the homes were eventually bought by middle-class families mainly of merchants, civil servants, and craftsmen. The growing settlement became independent of Rákoskeresztúr( 1907 ). In 1930 it had a population of 3112 inhabitants and the number of craftsmen was over 100.

Alternate common names for the species include goldring and silver perch. is named for the fish. The genus name Promoxis refers to crappies' sharp operculum, while the species name annularis means 'having rings', i.e., it has vaguely vertical bars on the body. Description White crappies are morphologically similar to black crappies. They have 5–10 dark vertical bars along their bodies, rather than the randomly scattered spots like the black crappie. The white crappie has a silvery color with green or brown shades along its back, with dark lateral bars along its side, and a white belly. The dorsal fins of the white crappie starts farther back on the body than those of the black crappie. The anal fin is about the same size as the dorsal fin. The white crappie has six dorsal fin spines, whereas the black crappie has seven or eight dorsal fin spines. White crappies are also slightly more elongated than black crappies. The white crappie is a deep-bodied fish with a flattened body, or a depth that is one- third of the length of the fish. White crappies have spinous rays and ctenoid fish scales found in advanced teleosts. The exposed part of the scale has tiny tooth-like projections (cteni). Both species of crappies have a terminal mouth position with many small, conical teeth in two rows along the mouth and are called cardiform because they resemble a tool used for wool carding. Crappies belong to the family Centrarchidae in the infraclass Teleostei, which is one of three infraclasses in the class Actinopterygii. The white crappie rarely exceeds , and typically lives 2–7 years. The species is generally about in length as an adult. The current for all-tackle fishing world record for a white crappie is .IGFA World Record:White Crappie - (Pomoxis annularis) Distribution White crappies are native to the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi River basins expanding from New York and southern Ontario westward to South Dakota and southward to Texas. This species has a large geographic range in the United States and currently has a stable population. Currently, this species is listed as a least concern species for conservation efforts. Habitat White crappies can be found in large rivers, reservoirs and lakes. White crappies are more tolerant of turbid (murky) waters than black crappies. The white crappie usually outnumbers the black crappie in turbid waters and in areas with little rooted aquatic vegetation White crappies are most commonly found in rivers and low-velocity areas such as pools and backwaters of rivers. They are most abundant in lakes and reservoirs larger than 5 acres. The white crappie can be found in the open water during the mornings and evenings, but during the day this species is found in shallower, quiet waters ( deep) surrounded by structure. Reproduction White crappies spawn in May and June when the water temperature reaches 56°F. Males construct nests by creating small, bowl-shaped depressions on the bottom around brush, rocks, and logs in the shallow water. During the spawning season, males develop dark coloration on their throats. Females lay 5,000 to 30,000 eggs. The males guard these nests until the fry swim away. Males guard these nests because it helps ensure the success of their genes being passed on to the next generation. The white crappie typically grows within the first year of its life and can grow an additional 3-4 in in the second year. The white crappies reach maturity around their second or third year. Diet White crappies are neither cruise- nor ambush-feeding strategists. Instead, they swim intermittently and only search for prey when stationary. This strategy is considered saltatory, or pause-and-travel search. Using this strategy, juveniles can grow rapidly in the first few days of life. This strategy is energetically favored to reduce search time for the species. White crappies in the larval and juvenile stages of life eat zooplankton and continue to feed primarily on small invertebrates during their first year of life. When white crappies reach a length of , they are considered adult. The adults feeds mainly on small fish and large invertebrates such as crayfish and hellgrammites. The terminal mouth position, sometimes known as the normal position, allows for this species to feed on what is in front of it.

It is very similar to the white crappie in size, shape, and habits, except that it is darker, with a pattern of black spots. Description Black crappies are most accurately identified by the seven or eight spines on its dorsal fin (white crappies have five or six dorsal spines). Crappies have a deep and laterally compressed body. They are usually silvery-gray to green in color and show irregular or mottled black splotches over the entire body. Black crappies have rows of dark spots on their dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. The dorsal and anal fins resemble each other in shape. Both crappies have large mouths extending to below the eye, and thin lips—both suggestive of their piscivorous feeding habits. Crappies are typically about long. The current all-tackle fishing world record for a black crappie is . The maximum length reported for a black crappie is and the maximum published weight is just under . Black crappie, San Joaquin Valley, California Distribution The black crappie's range is uncertain, since it has been widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie's. Its native range is suspected to be in the eastern United States and Canada, and as of 2005, populations existed in all of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. Introduced populations also exist in Mexico and Panama. Habitat The black crappie's habitats are lakes, reservoirs, borrow pits, and navigation pools in large rivers. They prefer areas with little or no current, clear water, and abundant cover such as submerged timber or aquatic vegetation, as well as sand or mud bottoms like those found in lakes, ponds, streams, and sloughs. Like P. annularis, P. nigromaculatus is very prolific and can tend to overpopulate its environment, with negative consequences both for the crappie and for other fish species. A commercial supplier of the fish, however, claims that it can be safely stocked in ponds as small as in area. Diet Crappies feed early in the morning and from about midnight until approximately 2 am. Individuals smaller than about 16 cm in length eat plankton and minuscule crustaceans, while larger individuals feed on small fish (like shad), as well as minnows. Adult black crappie feed on fewer fish than white crappie do; instead they consume a larger volume of insects and crustaceans. According to scientific studies carried out in California, mysid shrimp, Neomysis awatschensis, as well as amphipods, and Corophium, were the most commonly eaten by all sizes of black crappie. Although this diet is popular among black crappies in general, their diet may significantly change based on habitat, availability of food, and other biotic factors such as amount of resource competition. The same study also showed that young, small crappie tend to feed on small aquatic invertebrate animals and changed to a fish-filled diet as they matured to adulthood. Its diet, as an adult, tends to be less dominated by other fish than that of the white crappie. Relationships with humans Crappies are a very popular sport fish, as they are easy to catch during their feeding times.Crappie Fishing Information – Information on Fishing for Crappie – Retrieved 2013-07-24 There are minimal number and size restriction limits for fishing the crappie species. Conservation status Black crappies can be safely harvested under minimal, reasonable regulations, as long as there is no permanent damage to the fishery or environment. The black crappie is not listed as a species under threat on the IUCN Red List. Reproduction and life cycle Black crappies mature at 2–4 years. Growth during the first four years of their life is faster in the warm waters of the southern part of its range than in cooler waters in the north. White crappie have a higher growth rate in terms of length than black crappie. Most fish that are caught for sport are between 2 and 5 years old. The breeding season varies by location, due to the species' great range. Breeding temperature is 14‒20 °C (58‒68 °F) and spawning occurs in spring and early summer. Spawning occurs in a nest built by the male. Males use their bodies and tails to sweep out an area of sand or mud in shallow water (between one and six feet deep) usually near a shoreline and vegetation to create a nest. Black crappies appear to nest in the most protected areas (such as places with woody debris or live vegetation) possible. Female crappies produce an average of 40,000 spherical eggs, the number depending on their age and size. After spawning, the male watches over the nest until eggs hatch, which is usually about 2–3 days. Newly hatched fish larvae are about long and appear translucent. They stay in the nest for several days before moving to shallow, sheltered waters. The oldest recorded age of a specimen is fifteen years, although seven years is a more typical life span for the species. Etymology Pomoxis, the genus name, is Greek: \\"poma, -atos\\" and \\"oxys\\" meaning sharp operculum. This references the fish's spined gill covers. The species name, nigromaculatus, is derived from Latin and means \\"black-spotted\\".

He is best known for co- writing Marco Polo's autobiography, The Travels of Marco Polo, while they were in prison together in Genoa. Earlier, he wrote the Roman de Roi Artus (Romance of King Arthur), also known as the Compilation, the earliest known Arthurian romance by an Italian author. Life and work Rustichello appears to have been a native of Pisa. His first known work, the French text known as the Roman de Roi Artus or, simply, the Compilation, appears to derive from a particular book in the possession of Edward I of England when he passed through Italy on his way to fighting in the Eighth Crusade in 1270 to 1274. While written in French, it is the first known romance by an Italian author to address the Arthurian legend.Hoffman, \\"Rusticiano Pisa\\", p. 392. The Compilation contains an interpolation of the Palamedes, a now-fragmentary prose account of Arthur's Saracen knight Palamedes, and a history of the Round Table.Lacy, \\"Palamedes\\", p. 352. It was later divided into two sections, named after their principal protagonists, Meliadus (Tristan's father) and Guiron le Courtois. Both remained popular for hundreds of years, and influenced many later works written in French as well as in Spanish, Italian, and even Greek. Rustichello may have been captured by the Genoese at the Battle of Meloria in 1284, amid a conflict between the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Pisa. When Polo was imprisoned around 1298, possibly after a clash between Genoa and Venice (according to tradition the Battle of CurzolaThe Travels of Marco Polo, p. 16.), he told his tales of travel to Rustichello.

Furthermore, the agency determines the impact of imports on U.S. industries and directs actions against unfair trade practices, such as subsidies, dumping, patent, trademark, and copyright infringement. Background and statutory authority The USITC was established by the U.S. Congress on September 8, 1916, as the U.S. Tariff Commission.39 Stat. 795 In 1974, the name was changed to the U.S. International Trade Commission by section 171 of the Trade Act of 1974. Statutory authority for the USITC's responsibilities is provided by the following legislation: * Tariff Act of 1930 * Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 * Trade Expansion Act of 1962 * Trade Act of 1974 * Trade Agreements Act of 1979 * Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 * Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 * Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 Mission USITC, Washington, DC The U.S. International Trade Commission seeks to: # Administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and objective manner; # Provide the President, Office of the United States Trade Representative, and Congress with independent, quality analysis, information, and support on matters of tariffs and international trade and competitiveness; and # Maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. In so doing, the Commission serves the public by implementing U.S. law and contributing to the development and implementation of sound and informed U.S. trade policy. The USITC's five operations are: # Import Injury Investigations # Intellectual Property-Based Import Investigations # Research Program # Trade Information Services # Trade Policy Support Commissioners The president nominates and the U.S. Senate confirms the six commissioners who make up the USITC. The president and the secretary of state sign the formal commission. Commissioners' terms are nine years, or, when filling a vacated seat, for the remainder of a term. Their terms are staggered to end 18 months apart. Commissioners may not be reappointed at the start of a new term unless they have served less than five years, although commissioners stay on past the end of their term until their successor is appointed and confirmed. No more than three of the commissioners may be of the same political party. The chairman and vice chairman's terms are for two years, and successive chairmen may not be of the same political party. Only a commissioner with more than one year of service may be designated chairman. The commissioners are (in order of seniority):USITC Commissioners Biography List , USITC website * David S.

Scott Kieff, June 30, 2017) Hearings Although the USITC is not a court, its administrative law judges conduct trial-type official administrative hearings. If a Section 337 Tariff Act complaint has at least three votes from its six Commissioners, an official investigative hearing will be assigned to an administrative law judge. Several dozen new USITC investigations are filed every year. Judicial review is normally exercised by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. After the parties have had the opportunity to conduct fact and expert discovery to develop their respective legal positions, the ALJ (administrative law judge) holds a formal, evidentiary hearing, or trial. There is no jury. About three months after considering the arguments of the parties, the ALJ renders an initial determination (ID). The full ITC reviews and may adopt, modify or reverse the ALJ's initial determination. The ITC's final determination is usually issued about four months after the ALJ's ID. The USITC can impose exclusion orders that keep violating products from entering the United States. Exclusion orders are those in which disallow products from entering the United States for sale. While the Administrative Law Judges make determinations, the final decision of relief (i.e. exclusion from import) is made by the President of the United States. Should a party disagree with the decision, appeals may be made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. History  As part of a large group of legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 1900s, U.S. Congress established the United States Tariff Commission in 1916, which had a purpose to apply scientific principles to the study of tariffs and to assist in recommending appropriate tariff levels.USITC History, https://www.usitc.gov/flash/dynamic_timeline.htm Frank Taussig, then an Economics professor at Harvard University, was named the U.S. Tariff Commission's very first Chairman. The first offices of the U.S. Tariff Commission were located at 1322 New York Avenue, Washington D.C. Also in 1921, the U.S. Tariff Commission moved to the Old Post Office Building at 7th and E Street NW. Effective January 1, 1975, the U.S. Tariff Commission was renamed the U.S. International Trade Commission. The USITC had a number of new responsibilities under the Trade Act of 1974, and commission procedures under Section 337 of Tariff Act of 1930 were greatly changed, and Section 337 proceedings brought before Administrative Law Judges had to now conform with the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 337 decisions were also made final, instead of advisory (although subject to presidential disapproval due to policy reasons), and the USITC was also authorized to issue cease and desist orders in addition to exclusion orders. In 1988, the USITC moved its quarters from the Old Post Office Building to the building it remains in to this day, 500 E Street SW. Past commissioners of the USITC include: * Paula Stern (D-TN, sworn in October, 1978, for a term expiring on February, 1987) * Daniel R.

The estate belonged to the family, who sold it to the East India Company in 1854. The Belvedere Estate consists of Belvedere House and the grounds surrounding it, in which the National Library of India is housed, since 1948. It is located in Alipore, near the zoo, in Kolkata. Belvedere House was the former palace for the Viceroy of India and later the Governor of Bengal. The Governor-General resided in Belvedere House, Kolkata until the early nineteenth century, when Government House (present Raj Bhavan) was constructed. In 1854, after the Governor-General moved out, the Lieutenant- Governor of Bengal took up residence in Belvedere House. When the capital moved from Kolkata to Delhi in 1912, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full governor and transferred to Government House. History It is believed that the roots of Belvedere House lie in the late 1760s from approximately the time when Mir Jafar Ali Khan, the Nawab of the province of Bengal was compelled by the British East India Company to abdicate his throne at Murshidabad to Qasim Khan in 1760. Mir Jafar moved to Kolkata where he is thought to have owned a large court house, and settled within the safety of English East India Company fortifications at Alipore. It is believed that while he was in Kolkata, he built many buildings in the area and gifted Belvedere House to Warren Hastings. After the Battle of Buxar in 1764 Hastings left for England. Two governors, Verelst and Cartier occupied the Belvedere during the period when Hastings was away in England. Hastings returned to Kolkata as governor in 1772 and to his garden house, the Belvedere with a certain Baroness Inhoff by his side. The grounds of Belvedere Estate were witness to a duel between Warren Hastings and his legal officer, Philip Francis. The duel may have been over the Baroness Inhoff who was staying with Hastings in Belvedere House, although an Australian historian, Arthur Staples, is inclined to conclude that the duel was the outcome of political conflict between the two. There is not much clarity around this period of the history of Belvedere Estate and it is believed that Hastings finally sold Belvedere House to a Major Tolly in the 1780s for the sum of Rs. 60,000. Major Tolly died in 1784 and his family sold the property in 1802. From 1854 to 1911 the Belvedere housed a number of lieutenant governors, starting with Halliday, till the British India capital moved to Delhi. National Library of India, Kolkata, is housed in the building since 1948. Charles Robert Prinsep (1790–1864), a Cambridge graduate and Lincoln's Inn barrister from a family with long associations to India, lived at Belvedere Estate for a time. (He later named family property in Australia 'Belvedere' after the estate.) Prinsep served as standing counsel to the East India Company and then as the Judge Advocate General of India during the time when he resided at Belvedere. He was the brother of Henry Thoby Prinsep, a civil servant in India. After this it was turned into the official residence of the Viceroy of India. There is talk of unconfirmed supernatural sightings in the house as well as the grounds, with rumours of the ballroom being lit up and carriages drawing up in the driveway. The complex now includes within it, two housing colonies built by the government, one being for National Library of India employees, and the other for central government employees. The main building is under the care of the Archaeological Survey of India. The portion of Belvedere Estate, which is being used as residential complex for fairly senior Central Government employees and is known as '1, Belvedere Estate, Alipore Road', consists of 24 Type VI houses and 77 Type V houses, is under the control and maintenance by the CPWD ( Central Public Works Department) and provides very quiet and pollution free housing, with plenty of old trees and walking area, to the Central Government Employees.

In Slavic mythology and folklore, the Firebird (, zhar-ptitsa; , zhar-ptytsia; , жар-птица; , Zhar-ptitsa; , Žar-ptica; ; ; ; ) is a magical and prophetic glowing or burning bird from a faraway land which is both a blessing and a harbinger of doom to its captor. Description The Firebird is described as a large bird with majestic plumage that glows brightly emitting red, orange, and yellow light, like a bonfire that is just past the turbulent flame. The feathers do not cease glowing if removed, and one feather can light a large room if not concealed. In later iconography, the form of the Firebird is usually that of a smallish fire-colored falcon, complete with a crest on its head and tail feathers with glowing \\"eyes\\". It is beautiful but dangerous, showing no sign of friendliness. The story of the Firebird inspired many literary works, including \\"The Little Humpback Horse\\" by Pyotr Yershov. The most famous production of the Firebird was by Sergei Diaghilev of Ballets Russes who commissioned composer Igor Stravinsky to create the enormously popular large-scale ballet score known as The Firebird. Fairy tales A typical role of the Firebird in fairy tales is as an object of a difficult quest. The quest is usually initiated by finding a lost tail feather, at which point the hero sets out to find and capture the live bird, sometimes of his own accord, but usually on the bidding of a father or king. The Firebird is a marvel, highly coveted, but the hero, initially charmed by the wonder of the feather, eventually blames it for his troubles. The Firebird tales follow the classical scheme of fairy tale, with the feather serving as a premonition of a hard journey, with magical helpers met on the way who help in travel and capture of the Bird, and returning from the faraway land with the prize. There are many versions of the Firebird story as it was primarily told orally in the beginning. One version is the tale of Ivan Tsarevich and the Grey Wolf. Suzanne Massie retells another story of the Firebird legend . A modest and gentle orphan girl named Maryushka lives in a small village. People would come from all over to buy her embroidery, and many merchants asked her to come away and work for them. She told them all that she would sell to any who found her work beautiful, but she would never leave the village of her birth. One day the evil sorcerer Kaschei the Immortal heard of Maryushka's beautiful needlework and transformed himself into a beautiful young man and visited her. Upon seeing her ability he became enraged that a mere mortal could produce finer work than he himself possessed. He tried to tempt her by offering to make her Queen if she would embroider for him alone, but she refused saying she never wanted to leave her village. Because of this last insult to his ego he turned Maryushka into a Firebird, and himself into a great black Falcon, picked her up in his talons, and stole her away from her village. To leave a memory of herself with her village forever she shed her feathers onto the land below. As the last feather fell Maryushka died in the falcon's talons. The glowing rainbow feathers were magic and remain undimmed, but show their colors only to those who love beauty and seek to make beauty for others. Irina Zheleytova translates another version, The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa. In this version a king's archer is on a hunt and runs across a firebird's feather. The archer's horse warns the archer not to touch it, as bad things will happen. The archer ignores the advice and takes it to bring back to the king so he will be praised and rewarded. When the king is presented with the feather he demands the entire firebird or the death of the archer. The archer weeps to his horse, who instructs him to put corn on the fields in order to capture the firebird. The firebird comes down to eat, allowing the archer to capture the bird. When the king is presented with the firebird he demands that the archer fetch the Princess Vassilissa so the king may marry her; otherwise, the archer will be killed. The archer goes to the princess' lands and drugs her with wine to bring her back to the king. The king is pleased and rewards the archer; however, when the princess awakes and realizes she is not home she begins to weep. If she is to be married she wants her wedding dress, which is under a rock in the middle of the Blue Sea. Once again the archer weeps to his horse and fulfills his duty to his king and brings back the dress. The princess is stubborn and refuses to marry the king even with her dress until the archer is dipped in boiling water. The archer begs to see his horse before he is boiled and the horse puts a spell on the archer to protect him from the water. The archer comes out more handsome than anyone had ever seen. The king sees this and jumps in as well but is instead boiled alive. The archer is chosen to be king and marries the princess and they live happily ever after. Prince Ivan returning on a magic carpet with the caged firebird. The Firebird concept has parallels in Iranian legends of magical birds, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about The Golden Bird, and related Russian magical birds like the Sirin. The story of the quest itself is closely paralleled by Armenian Hazaran Blbul. In the Armenian tale, however, the bird does not glow, but rather makes the land bloom through its song. In Czech folklore, it is called Pták Ohnivák (Fire-like Bird) and appears, for example, in a Karel Jaromír Erben fairy tale, also as an object of a difficult quest. Moreover, in the beginning of this fairy tale, the bird steals magical golden apples belonging to a king and is therefore pursued by the king's servants in order to protect the precious apples. The story of the firebird comes in many forms. Some folk tales say that the Firebird is a mystical bird that flies around a king's castle and at night swoops down and eats all the king's golden apples. Others say that the firebird is just a bird that flies around giving hope to those who need it. Some additions to that legend say that when the firebird flies around, his eyes sparkle and pearls fall from his beak. The pearls would then fall to the peasants, giving them something to trade for goods or services. In the most common version of the legend, a Tsar commands his three sons to capture the firebird that keeps flying down from above and eating his apples. The golden apples are in the Tsar's orchard and give youth and strength to all who eat them. The sons end up barely missing the bird, but they catch one of his feathers that glows in the night. They take it to a dark room and it lights the room completely. Literary and musical works The story of the Firebird quest has inspired literary works, including \\"The Little Humpback Horse\\" by Pyotr Yershov. The most famous version of the Firebird legend was the production by Sergei Diaghilev of Ballet Russe, who commissioned composer Igor Stravinsky to score the enormously popular large-scale ballet called The Firebird. In Stravinsky's ballet, with a scenario written by Michel Fokine and Alexandre Benois, the creature is half-woman, half-bird. She is captured by Prince Ivan, but when he sets her free she gives him a magic feather, which he uses to defeat the spell of Kaschei the Immortal, who had captured thirteen princesses. Prince Ivan then marries the most beautiful of them. French illustrator Edmund Dulac included a literary version of the legend of the firebird in his book Fairy Tales of the Allied Nations, where the bird is identified as the Firebird and described as \\"Hausa, the Bird of the Sun\\".Dulac, Edmund.

His reign represented the start of a new era in Brunei. The discovery of oil changed the whole course of Brunei's history and enabled faster development in all sectors of the country. The expansion and improvement of formal education and his encouragement of religious education were some of his additional contributions to Brunei Darussalam. Biography Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin was born on 22 August 1913 at Istana Pekan in Brunei Town. He was the surviving eldest son to Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II and his wife, Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Siti Fatimah, after his older brother, Pengiran Muda Bongsu had died in 1910. His younger brother, Pengiran Muda Tengah Omar Ali Saifuddien succeeded him after his death. Before becoming the sultan, he was known as Pengiran Muda Besar Ahmad Tajuddin. =Early education= He received his early education in the palace. One of the teachers who had been assigned to teach him was Cikgu Salleh Haji Masri. Salleh Haji Masri was one of the famous freedom fighters with anti- colonial sentiments. The Sultan's relationship with Salleh was close. He was not the only one learning, as there were also the sons of the chiefs of state who accompanied him. In those days, it had become tradition that the royal family would receive their early education at the Palace to adapt themselves to the knowledge of modern education before they step into the realm of a more formal schooling. In contrast to him, he did not enter formal schooling because of the influence of the royal custom that is still strong at that time, which did not allow him to learn along with the common people despite the fact that the system of modern education was started in Brunei since 1914. In terms of religious education, since early childhood, he was educated in a variety of knowledge about the religion of Islam. His parents had also invited scholars and intellectuals in the Palace of religious knowledge to teach the royal family in reading the Quran and everything related to religion. =Accession to the throne= Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin ascended the throne on 11 September 1924, after the death of his father, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II. Due to his young age of 11, the reign was temporarily held by a Council of Regency which consisted of Pengiran Bendahara Pengiran Anak Abdul Rahman and Pengiran Pemancha Pengiran Anak Haji Mohammad Yassin from 11 September 1924 to 19 September 1931. The ceremony was attended by the British Resident in Brunei at that time, Mr. E.E.F. Pretty. =Studying in England= He sailed for England in 1932. Before that, he had learned English from Mr. H.F. Stalley. He was in England for a year to learn the English language and a description of the western civilisation. He was the first Sultan in history to explore the western world more than his father, who had only sailed to Singapore and Labuan. =Marriage= Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin was married to Tengku Raihani, the eldest daughter of Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah of Selangor on 30 April 1934, when he was 20 years old. Tengku Raihani was crowned as Tengku Ampuan of Brunei on 17 March 1940. In conjunction with his wedding ceremony, he has ordered a new palace to be built and named Istana Mahkota Khairani, where he and his wife lived. He also intended to change the name of Brunei Mosque to Ahmedia Mosque. However, upon completion of his wedding ceremony, a new palace was named Istana Mahkota and Brunei Mosque retained its name. =Family= His marriage to Tengku Ampuan Raihani, saw them welcome a daughter, named Pengiran Anak Puteri Noor Ehsani, born on 15 October 1935. According to her husband, Tengku Pengiran Abdul Aziz, the actual name given by Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin to his eldest daughter was Pengiran Anak Puteri Niswanil Ehsanil Burniah. Before he married Tengku Ampuan Raihani, he was already married with Kadayang Amas (Maskaton) binti Ampuan Salleh, who came from an ordinary family, from Kampong Sultan Lama. They were blessed with 3 daughters, * Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Saerah (Balabab Besar), born in 1928, died in November 2013. * Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Zubaidah (Balabab Tengah) * Pengiran Anak Datin Seri Setia Siti Halimah (Balabab Damit), born in 1935, died in 2009.

Coronation ceremony The coronation of Ahmad Tajuddin as Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan Negara was held on 17 March 1940. Before that, he appointed and bestowed titles to the chiefs of the country, particularly to those who served the country. In conjunction with his coronation ceremony, King George VI bestowed on him The Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG), as suggested by Sir Shenton Thomas, the High Commissioner for the Malay States to the British Government.

Important events during Ahmad Tajuddin's reign The old Brunei flag during 1906 -1959. It was during the reign of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin that saw Brunei Darussalam having its own national anthem \\"Allah Peliharakan Sultan\\", which is the likeness of \\"God Save the King\\" in England. In 1947, the national anthem was composed by Awang Haji Besar bin Sagap and lyrics written by Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran Haji Mohammad Yusuf bin Pengiran Haji Abdul Rahim. That same year, he bestowed the title \\"Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara\\" to his brother, Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien. =The Japanese Occupation in Brunei= Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin and members of his court, 20 April 1941. With the likelihood of war with Japan increasing, in 1941, the British began to encourage the establishment of local defence forces in Brunei, and neighbouring Sarawak and Borneo. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin approved the establishment of the Brunei Volunteer Force and Special Police Force to assist the British in stopping the Japanese invasion of Brunei. An estimated 200 Bruneians initially volunteered, but by the time of the invasion few remained and no Allied troops were stationed in Brunei. The Sultan was appointed an Honorary Colonel of the force.Brunei in the Second World War, Harun Abdul Majid, Rebellion in Brunei: The 1962 Revolt, Imperialism, Confrontation and Oil - Volume 14 of International library of twentieth century history, I.B.Tauris, 2007, pages 12-13, , 9781845114237 After the surrender to the Japanese in December 1941, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin was forced to hand over his powers to the Japanese occupation army. The Japanese continued to recognise the Sultan as the head of the Islamic religion and the Royal Customs so long as he co-operated with them. He was advised by the Japanese to retire and offered a monthly pension together with medals of honour from the Emperor of Japan. =Retreat to Tantaya, Brunei liberation from Japanese rule= Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin together with his wife and party in a perahu after their journey from the village of Tentayer, whence they fled during the bombing of Brunei. By mid-1945, the Japanese were facing defeat and their forces in Brunei were becoming more violent in their actions toward the populace. A plan was made to save the Sultan and the royal family from this increased Japanese military violence. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin and the royal family, together with loyal palace officials, were hidden by Kasim bin Tamin, the village headman of Tantaya. A small palace had been built in Tantaya and the Sultan lived there for about three months until Brunei was retaken by the Australian army. The palace was guarded by the villagers to prevent any surprise attack by the Japanese. While the Sultan was in Tantaya, he lived like an ordinary citizen. He liked to eat Pulut Mangat which was often given to him by Kasim. After the Japanese surrender, the Sultan and the royal family returned to Brunei Town from Tantaya on Thursday at about 3:00 am. He was immediately taken to the British Army Headquarters at Bubongan Dua Belas, Residency Road. From here, he went to Istana Parit, KM2, Jalan Tutong. Sickness and death When Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin made a stopover in Singapore, before proceeding to the United Kingdom, he fell ill, and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital on 3 June 1950. His arrival at the hospital was accompanied by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. According to Dr. Monteiro who treated him, because of his deteriorating health at the time, his departure to London must be postponed or cancelled because he had bleeding in the stomach and required a blood transfusion. The Sultan went into a coma and died a few hours later on 4 June 1950, after his body did not respond to the blood transfusions. Funeral When news of his death spread, the Crown Prince of Johore, Tengku Ismail went to Singapore General Hospital, to bring the body of the late sultan to Istana Besar, Johore Bahru. As a sign of respect, the Singaporean government declared all government buildings in Singapore to fly the flag at half mast for two days. In Johore Bahru, his body was washed and covered with white cloth by Syed Salim bin Syed Hasan, the Chief Qadhi of Johore while the funeral prayer, led by the Mufti of Johore, Syed Alwi Al-Hadad. Upon completion of his funeral, his body was laid in state at the foyer of the Grand Palace of Johore Bahru, to provide opportunities for national dignitaries, senior government officials and local community leaders from different ethnic and religious, to pay their respects to the late monarch and send their condolences to his wife. They include: * Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia. * Sir Henry Gurney, British High Commissioner to Malaya. * Sir Franklin Charles Gimson, the Governor of Singapore. On 5 June 1950, his coffin was taken to Kallang Airport to be flown to Labuan with the British Royal Air Force, RAF Dakota, accompanied by his wife and the royal family. Before the plane took off to Labuan, many national dignitaries and foreign ambassadors, present at the Airport, to pay their respects to the late king. Among them were; * The Sultan of Selangor, his wife and the Crown Prince of Selangor. * Mr. A.D. York (on behalf of Malcolm MacDonald). * F.J. Mellersh, A.O.C. Malaya. * Mr. R.J. Curtis, British advisor to Selangor. * The Crown Prince of Johore and his wife. * Mr. Bradley and Mr. G.T. MacBryan. * Dato Wan Idris, Acting Chief Minister of Johore. In the state of Kelantan, all government departments, have been directed flying the flag at half mast for three days in a row, as a sign of mourning over his death. Meanwhile, in Penang, most merchant ships were ordered to fly the flag at half mast on Monday, 5 June 1950. As soon as the plane that carried his coffin arrived at Labuan Airport, it was met with a parade of honour, composed of members of the Police Force to pay their respects to the late Sultan. His coffin was then taken to the jetty to be brought to Brunei by ship. When the ship carrying his coffin arrived in Brunei Town, it was greeted with sorrow and sadness by the Royal Family, State Dignitaries, VIPs, senior government officials, and the people in attendance. His coffin was then taken to the Palace with special vehicles. His coffin was laid in state at Istana Mahkota, and then, at the General Office of the Government of Brunei, to give a last chance to the State Dignitaries, VIPs, senior government officials, and the people to pay their last respects to the late Sultan before the funeral ceremony take place. Before the interment ceremony, on 6 June 1950, his brother, Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara Pengiran Muda Omar Ali Saifuddien, was installed as the 28th Sultan of Brunei. The coffin was carried out of the Palace and headed to the Royal Mausoleum, accompanied by his younger brother, the new sultan, the royal family, dignitaries of the country, and the people, to be laid to rest at the Royal Mausoleum. His Highness was laid to rest beside his father, Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Alam II and his grandfather, Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin. Mr. Malcolm MacDonald once spoke about His Highness Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin, Aftermath After his death, his wife and daughter, settled in Kuching, before returning to Selangor. In 1960, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III was informed by the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah, that Tengku Ampuan Raihani would marry Raja Kamaluddin bin Raja Haji Harun, a member of Perak's royal family. He stated that if Tengku Ampuan Raihani was to be married to someone else, then she can no longer wear the Royal Regalia, and her monthly allowance will be terminated. Tengku Ampuan Raihani died in mid-1990. Places named after him Sekolah Rendah Ahmad Tajuddin, a primary school in Kuala Belait was named after the Sultan.

This is a spiny-finned fish with red or brown coloring on its body and fins. The first three rays of its pectoral fin separate from the others and are used in walking on the sea bottom. Sea Robin was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine on 1 March 1944; launched on 25 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Homer Ambrose, wife of Captain Ambrose, the Navy Yard's Production Superintendent; and commissioned on 7 August 1944, Lieutenant Commander Paul C. Stimson in command.  First patrol, November 1944 – January 1945  After shakedown off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, Sea Robin transited the Panama Canal on 12 October 1944 following an incident with a Scandinavian merchant ship which, mistaking the submarine for a German U-boat, frantically scattered shells in the general direction of the surfaced \\"enemy.\\" Fortunately, Sea Robin was out of range and escaped without damage. After spending six days at Pearl Harbor, Sea Robin sailed for Luzon Strait and her first war patrol where, on 6 January 1945, she torpedoed and sank her initial victim of the war, the 5,000-ton Japanese tanker Tarakan Maru. Except for dodging floating mines, the remainder of the submarine's first patrol was uneventful; and she returned to port at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 29 January 1945.  Second patrol, February – April 1945  Sea Robins second patrol proved to be her most productive of the war. On 3 March, while patrolling north of Surabaja in the Java Sea, the boat evaded a Japanese escort ship and torpedoed the cargo ship, Suiten Maru (2,500 tons). After several unsuccessful attempts to rescue survivors, the submarine finally hauled three prisoners of war on board and continued her patrol. Two days later, Sea Robin contacted a troop-laden convoy of two cargo ships, a converted gunboat, and several escorts. The gunboat Manyo Maru (2,900 tons) was the first to be sent to the bottom, the victim of three torpedo hits. After evading the suddenly active escort vessels, the submarine commenced an end around and, several hours later, was again in firing position. Shoyu Maru (853 tons), the first of the two vessels, was zigzagging radically but was unable to avoid the three torpedoes that Sea Robin fired at her. She took one hit below her bridge and settled quickly by the bow. Sea Robin then fired a spread of three torpedoes at the remaining ship, but the target zigged and they missed. On the second attempt, the ship was not so fortunate. After watching the target completely reverse course, the submarine fired three more torpedoes at a range of with one hit amidships that broke netlayer Nagaru Maru (856 tons) in half and sent her rapidly to the bottom. Sea Robin now began to pay the price for her success. For 24 hours, she was pursued by the escorts and accompanying aircraft; but made good her escape and arrived at Subic Bay, Philippines, on 15 March to replenish her depleted torpedo store. Departing Subic Bay on 19 March, Sea Robin set course for the South China Sea in the area of the island of Hainan where, on 23 March, she rescued a downed airman. On 30 March, the submarine found herself in the middle of a group of six Japanese destroyers. Midway between two of them, she launched three torpedoes at the first, but a quick turn of the ship caused them to pass harmlessly across the bow. The second destroyer swerved 90° and began to bear down on Sea Robin. After 20 minutes of depth charging, the submarine extricated herself and, with Hainan a scant away, again attacked, but a spread of six torpedoes failed to find a target, and the submarine resumed patrol. On 8 April, Sea Robin sank two small Japanese fishing vessels, taking three prisoners of war and, on the following day, took on board 10 more Japanese, survivors of a foundering trawler that had been attacked by Allied aircraft. The submarine terminated her second patrol at Pearl Harbor on 29 April.  Third patrol, June – August 1945  Sea Robin departed Pearl Harbor 1 June on her third and final war patrol which was conducted in the Yellow and East China seas. After sinking a small patrol craft on 9 July and taking one prisoner, Sea Robin torpedoed and sank the cargo ship, Sakishima Maru, on 10 July. Shortly thereafter, while attempting to sink a large sampan, the submarine was caught on the surface by a Japanese plane. Although the pilot did not drop his bombs on the first pass, thus giving Sea Robin a chance to dive, he dropped two close aboard on the second. Although it was not discovered until the end of the patrol, the submarine's bow tubes were severely damaged causing numerous torpedo misses throughout the remainder of the patrol. With the exception of several trawlers sunk in surface attacks, the remainder of the patrol was unproductive. When the war ended on 15 August, Sea Robin was moored at Midway Island. After a one-day stop at Pearl Harbor, the boat headed for home, transiting the Panama Canal on 20 September and arriving at Galveston, Texas, four days later.  1945 – 1951  Peacetime assignment brought Sea Robin to Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) based at Balboa, Canal Zone. On 15 May 1947, the submarine commenced a -month simulated war patrol in which she circumnavigated the South American continent and became the first U.S. submarine to round Cape Horn. The year 1948 was spent in fleet training exercises in the Balboa and Key West areas. Following overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Sea Robin was reassigned to SubRon 8 based at Naval Submarine Base New London, arriving on 20 August 1949. On 23 February 1950, the submarine departed New London for participation in Exercise \\"Portex,\\" a joint Army-Navy-Air Force exercise in the Caribbean, returning on 23 March. From September through November, she was engaged in her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.  1951 – 1955  In 1951, Sea Robin was converted to a GUPPY IA submarine, following which she returned to New London for local operations. In January and February 1952, the submarine participated in Exercise \\"Micowex\\" in the North Atlantic testing cold weather gear and procedures under the supervision of the Naval Research Laboratory, New London, followed by a return to warmer waters and participation in Exercise \\"Pacex\\" in the Caribbean. For the next two years, Sea Robin was engaged in local fleet and training operations in the New London area. On 30 August 1954, Sea Robin set sail for a six-week northern training cruise which stretched across the Arctic Circle and included stops at Glasgow, Scotland; and Belfast, Northern Ireland. On 4 January 1955, the submarine departed for six weeks in the Caribbean participating in operation \\"Springboard\\" and, in September, took part in NATO exercise \\"New Broom IV,\\" visiting Saint John, New Brunswick, en route home to New London, where she operated locally for the remainder of the year.  1956 – 1970  After engaging in special operations in late 1956 and early 1957, Sea Robin resumed normal duties in the New London area until entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 24 July 1957 for a two-month overhaul. Upon return to New London, she engaged in fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean until 28 March 1958 when she set sail for a -month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. For the next five years, with time out for regularly scheduled overhaul periods, Sea Robin operated in Atlantic and Caribbean waters, engaging in fleet antisubmarine warfare exercises and providing services to the United States Naval Submarine School. In September 1964, Sea Robin in the company of Piper participated in exercise \\"Master Stroke\\" with United States, Canadian, and British forces. During this exercise, they conducted port calls in Portsmouth, England and Rotterdam, Holland. Sea Robin returned to New London for local operations and entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in November for a scheduled overhaul, remaining there until April 1965. Following shakedown operations, Sea Robin, and departed New London in July for exercise with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean returning to New London in October. The year 1966 was spent in participation with operation \\"Springboard\\" forces in the Caribbean providing services to naval air squadrons and surface units followed by training and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises in the New London area. A scheduled main battery replacement was performed at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard during the months of July and August. Sea Robin participated in Operation Springboard in the early months of 1967, and resumed normal operations upon her return to New London. On 22 May 1967, Sea Robin put to sea in company with , , and Sea Owl for a two-month tour of northern European ports stopping at Portsmouth, England; Cherbourg, France; Derry, Northern Ireland; and various Scandinavian ports. From 2 October through 1 February 1968, Sea Robin underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and upon completion resumed normal duties in the Atlantic and Caribbean. On 1 December 1969, the submarine was transferred to SubRon 2, also based at New London. Highlights of 1970 were participation in operation \\"Springboard\\" in January and February and NATO exercise \\"Steel Ring\\" in April and May. On 4 August, the submarine made her 12,920th and final dive. On 1 October 1970, Sea Robin was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. She was sold for scrap on 3 June 1971 to the North American Smelting Co., Wilmington, Del.

She illustrated over 150 books, including fairy tales and Arthurian legends. She won the 1985 Caldecott Medal for U.S. picture book illustration, recognizing Saint George and the Dragon, retold by Margaret Hodges. Biography Born in Philadelphia to Margaret Doris Bruck and Albert H. Schart, she grew up in Wyncote, PennsylvaniaHyman  Pennsylvania Center for the Book Retrieved 2018-08-18. and learned to read and draw at an early age. Her favorite story as a child was Little Red Riding Hood, and she spent an entire year of her childhood wearing a red cape. She enrolled at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now part of the University of the Arts) in 1956, but moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1959 after marrying Harris Hyman, a mathematician and engineer. She graduated from School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1960. The couple then moved to Stockholm, Sweden, for two years, where Trina studied at the Konstfackskolan (Swedish State Art School) and illustrated her first children's book, titled Toffe och den lilla bilen (Toffe and the Little Car). In 1963, the couple's daughter, Katrin Tchana (née Hyman), was born, but in 1968, they divorced, and Trina and Katrin moved to Lyme, New Hampshire. Trina lived for some time with children's writer and editor Barbara Rogasky (with whom she collaborated on several projects). For about the last decade of her life, her romantic partner was teacher Jean K. Aull. She was the first art director of Cricket Magazine, from 1973 to 1979, and contributed illustrations regularly until her death. Many of her illustrations can be quite complex. For example, in one scene in Saint George and the Dragon, the dragon's tail stretches into the border artwork of the next page. She is also considered one of the first white American illustrators (after Ezra Jack Keats) to incorporate black characters into her illustrations regularly, as a matter of principle, in large part triggered by her daughter's marriage to a man from Cameroon. Her grandchildren appear in several of her books. Mother and daughter Katrin Tchana collaborated on The Serpent Slayer and Other Stories of Strong Women, retold by Katrin (2000); Sense Pass King: A Tale from Cameroon (2002); and Changing Woman and Her Sisters: Goddesses from Around the World (2006).

It is used for flat racing and is noted for its variety of interlaced tracks and a famous hill that provides a real challenge to competing thoroughbreds. It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length with 46 different starting posts. The course is home to more than half of the group one races held in France, and has a capacity of 50,000. The highlight of the calendar is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Held on the first weekend in October, the event attracts the best horses from around the world. Races at Longchamp - Édouard Manet, 1867 The first-ever race run at Longchamp was on Sunday, April 27, 1857 in front of a massive crowd. The Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugénie were present, having sailed down the Seine River on their private yacht to watch the third race. Until 1930, many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels, the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes. The royal couple joined Prince Jérôme Bonaparte and his son Prince Napoleon in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau, Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny, an avid racegoer. Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal enclosure and had to be content with watching from their barouche carriages on the lawn. A number of prominent artists have painted horse racing scenes at Longchamp including the one seen here by Édouard Manet in 1867 and another four years later by Edgar Degas titled Race Horses at Longchamp. Racing continued during the German occupation of France in World War II, with many German officers in the stands. Plan of the Longchamp Racecourse, Paris, France.

It typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone. Thermodynamically, it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm, but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low. In addition to snow, graupel or hail may fall as well. Occurrence Thundersnow, while relatively rare anywhere, is more common with lake-effect snow in the Great Lakes area of the United States and Canada, the midwestern United States, and the Great Salt Lake. Thundersnow also occurs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, sometimes several times per winter season. Bozeman, Montana also sees thundersnow more often than average with these storms typically occurring in April or May. In the United States, March is the peak month of formation; on average, only 6.4 events are reported per year.Patrick S. Market, Chris E. Halcomb, and Rebecca L. Ebert. A Climatology of Thundersnow Events over the Contiguous United States. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. The British Isles and other parts of northwestern Europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or (usually wet) snow showers during winter and spring. It is also common around Kanazawa and the Sea of Japan, and even around Mount Everest. Low-pressure events in the eastern Mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms, especially over the elevated provinces of Israel and Jordan, including Amman and Jerusalem. When such storms happen at areas intended for skiing, the mountains are often evacuated for safety. The South Region of Brazil registered episodes of thundersnow in 1984 and 2005, in the state of Santa Catarina, and in August 2011, in some municipalities of the highland region of Serra Gaúcha, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Acoustic effects One unique aspect of thundersnow is that the suspended and deposited snowfall act as an acoustic suppressor of the sound of thunder. The thunder from a typical thunderstorm can be heard many miles away, while the thunder from thundersnow can usually only be heard within a radius from the lightning. Formation There are usually three causes of thundersnow: * A normal thunderstorm on the leading edge of a cold front or warm front that can either form in a winter environment, or that runs into cool air, and where the precipitation takes the form of snow * A heavy synoptic snowstorm that sustains strong vertical mixing which allows for favourable conditions for lightning and thunder to occur * A lake effect or ocean effect thunderstorm which is produced by cold air passing over relatively warm water; this effect commonly produces snow squalls over the Great Lakes =Lake effect precipitation= A large squall producing heavy snow and frequent lightning over Buffalo, NY. Lake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or shortwave aloft passes over a body of water. This steepens the thermal lapse rates between the lake temperature and the temperatures aloft. A difference in temperature of or more between the lake temperature and the temperature at about (the 850 hPa level) usually marks the onset of thundersnow, if surface temperatures are expected to be below freezing. However several factors, including other geographical elements, affect the development of thundersnow. The primary factor is convective depth. This is the vertical depth in the troposphere that a parcel of air will rise from the ground before it reaches the equilibrium (EQL) level and stops rising. A minimum depth of is necessary, and an average depth of or more is generally accepted as sufficient. Wind shear is also a significant factor. Linear snow squall bands produce more thundersnow than clustered bands; thus a directional wind shear with a change of less than between the ground and in height must be in place. However, any change in direction greater than through that layer will tear the snow squall apart. A bare minimum fetch of is required so that the air passing over the lake or ocean water will become sufficiently saturated with moisture and will acquire thermal energy from the water. The last component is the echo top or storm top temperature. This must be at least . It is generally accepted that at this temperature there is no longer any super cooled water vapour present in a cloud, but just ice crystals suspended in the air. This allows for the interaction of the ice cloud and graupel pellets within the storm to generate a charge, resulting in lightning and thunder. the USA Today. Jack Williams. Warm water helps create Great Lakes snowstorms. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. =Synoptic forcing= Synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex, with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow. The best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its NorthWest quadrant (in the Northern Hemisphere, based on observations in the Midwestern United States), within what is known as the \\"comma head\\" of a mature extratropical cyclone.Patrick S. Market, Angela M. Oravetz, David Gaede, Evan Bookbinder, Rebecca Ebert, and Christopher Melick. Upper Air Constant Pressure Composites of Midwestern Thundersnow Events. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. Thundersnow can also be located underneath the TROWAL, a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone.National Weather Service Office, St. Louis, Missouri. Thundersnow Proximity Soundings. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. In extreme cases, thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low-pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice, once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front. The 1991 Halloween blizzard, Superstorm of 1993, and White Juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow. =Upslope flow= Similar to the lake effect regime, thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone when a shortwave aloft moves into the region. The shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates, allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing, and occasionally thundersnow.National Weather Service Office, Sacramento, California. Alexander Tardy. Western Region Technical Attachment No. 02-13: Thundersnow in the Sierra Nevada. Retrieved on 01-11-2006. Hazards Thundersnow produces heavy snowfall rates in the range of per hour. Snowfall of this intensity may limit visibilities severely, even during light wind conditions. However, thundersnow is often a part of a severe winter storm or blizzard. Winds of above tropical storm force are frequent with thundersnow. As a result, visibilities in thundersnow are frequently under 2/5th of a mile. Additionally, such wind creates extreme wind chills and may result in frostbite. Finally, there is a greater likelihood that thundersnow lightning will have a positive polarity, which is associated with a greater destructive potential than the more common negatively-charged lightning.

He is a three-time Scottish chess champion and was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1999. As Director of the Social Brain Centre at the United Kingdom's Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), he authored numerous research reports on behavior change, climate change, and spirituality. Career He made his Scotland debut for the national Primary School team in the match against England in 1988. At this time he attended Skene Square Primary School, though he later attended Aberdeen Grammar School where a Maths teacher, Michael Wilson, organised and encouraged the school team. Although in 1988 he was not the best player in his age-group at the time, his progress was rapid and he began competing on the world stage in 1991, winning a silver medal in the European Under 18 Championship in 1995 (behind Robert Kempiński of Poland). After taking a year out to study chess in the wake of this success, he went to Keble College, Oxford University where he earned a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Rowson has an interest in Eastern thought and, following a year at Harvard, completed a PhD thesis on Wisdom at Bristol University, supervised by Guy Claxton. He came second in the European Under 20 Championship in 1997 and achieved his third and final norm required for the title of Grandmaster (and with it the title) in the 1999 Scottish Chess Championship. He went on to win the event again in 2001 and 2004, completing a rare double when he went on to become the 2004 British Champion. He successfully defended his British title in 2005 and again in 2006. He also won the 2000 Canadian Open Chess Championship and tied for first with Vasilios Kotronias in the Hastings International Chess Congress in 2003/04. Rowson is Director of the Social Brain Centre at the RSA. After degrees spanning a range of social science disciplines from Oxford and Harvard, Jonathan's Doctoral research at the University of Bristol featured an analysis of the challenge of overcoming the psycho-social constraints that prevent people becoming ‘wiser’. He writes for The Guardian's Behavioural Insights Blog, was formerly a columnist for the Herald newspaper, has authored three books.http://www.thersa.org/data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1550171/Spiritualise- report.pdf In 2016, he founded the research institute Perspectiva in London together with Tomas Björkman.

It offers particularly good views of Mount Bachelor and provides access to many recreational facilities in central Oregon. The route is so named because it weaves past a number of small natural lakes along the Cascades, as well as several reservoirs on the upper Deschutes River.

Biography Pietro Longhi was born in Venice in the parish of Saint Maria, first child of the silversmith Alessandro Falca and his wife, Antonia. He adopted the Longhi last name when he began to paint. He was initially taught by the Veronese painter Antonio Balestra, who then recommended the young painter to apprentice with the Bolognese Giuseppe Maria Crespi, who was highly regarded in his day for both religious and genre painting and was influenced by the work of Dutch painters. Longhi returned to Venice before 1732. He was married in 1732 to Caterina Maria Rizzi, by whom he had eleven children (only three of which reached the age of maturity). Among his early paintings are some altarpieces and religious themes. His first major documented work was an altarpiece for the church of San Pellegrino in 1732. In 1734, he completed frescoes in the walls and ceiling of the hall in Ca' Sagredo, representing the Death of the giants. In the late 1730s, he began to specialize in the small-scale genre works that would lead him to be viewed in the future as the Venetian William Hogarth, painting subjects and events of everyday life in Venice. Longhi's gallant interior scenes reflect the 18th century's turn towards the private and the bourgeois, and were extremely popular. Many of his paintings show Venetians at play, such as the depiction of the crowd of genteel citizens awkwardly gawking at a freakish Indian rhinoceros. This painting, on display at the National Gallery in London, chronicles Clara the rhinoceros brought to Europe in 1741 by a Dutch sea captain and impresario from Leyden, Douvemont van der Meer. This rhinoceros was exhibited in Venice in 1751.Note artists' fascination with the species as evidenced by Dürer's Rhinoceros more than two centuries earlier There are two versions of this painting, nearly identical except for the unmasked portraits of two men in Ca' Rezzonico version.Other version in National Gallery, London Ultimately, there may be a punning joke to the painting, since the young man on the left holds aloft the sawed-off horn (metaphor for cuckoldry) of the animal. Perhaps this explains the difference between the unchaperoned women. L'atelier del pittore (between 1740 and 1746) Other paintings chronicle the daily activities such as the gambling parlors (Ridotti) that proliferated in the 18th century.Compare it to Francesco Guardi's contemporary painting of the Ridotto from Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless, hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks.Spike JT. p203 In some, the insecure or naive posture and circumstance, the puppet-like delicacy of the persons, seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects. That this puppet-like quality was an intentional conceit on Longhi's part is attested by the skillful rendering of figures in his earlier history paintings and in his drawings.\\"Pietro Longhi\\", Oxford Art Online Longhi's many drawings, typically in black chalk or pencil heightened with white chalk on colored paper, were often done for their own sake, rather than as studies for paintings. In the 1750s, Longhi—like Crespi before him—was commissioned to paint seven canvases documenting the seven Catholic sacraments. These are now in Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia along with his scenes from the hunt (Caccia). From 1763 Longhi was Director of the Academy of Drawing and Carving. From this period, he began to work extensively with portraiture, and was actively assisted by his son, Alessandro. Longhi died on 8 May 1785, following a short illness. Legacy Celebrated genre canvases were produced by other contemporary artists in Italy such as Gaspare Traversi and Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Longhi had not only departed the world of grand mythology of history that often allured the Venetian nobility, but also taken residence in its intimate present, as few painters in Venice had ever done. If Canaletto and Guardi are our window to the external rituals of the republic, Longhi is our window to what happened inside rooms. The critic Bernard Berenson states that:The Venetian painters of the renaissance: with an index to their works, Third edition (1901), by Bernard Berenson, G.P. Putnam and Sons, pp. 73–74. > Longhi painted for the picture-loving Venetians their own lives in all their > ordinary domestic and fashionable phases. In the hair-dressing scenes, we > hear the gossip of the periwigged barber; in the dressmaking scenes, the > chatter of the maid; in the dancing-school, the pleasant music of the > violin. There is no tragic note anywhere. Everybody dresses, dances, makes > bows, takes coffee, as if there were nothing else in the world that wanted > doing. A tone of high courtesy, of great refinement, coupled with an all- > pervading cheerfulness, distinguishes Longhi's pictures from the works of > Hogarth, at once so brutal and so full of presage of change. Masks In numerous paintings, Longhi depicts masked figures engaging in various acts from gambling to flirting. For example, in the foreground of Longhi's painting The Meeting of the Procuratore and His Wife is a woman being greeted by a man that is presumed to be her husband. The setting is of a type of gathering place usually for masked people to engage in private matters such as romantic encounters.Pignatti 1969, p. 81 The woman and her husband are unmasked, but at the left, a seated woman is unmasking herself to address a masked man leaning over her shoulder. This act may suggest that the woman's Moretta mask, which lacks an opening for the mouth, requires her to unmask herself in order to speak; another interpretation is that the woman is interested enough in the masked man to remove her mask in order to reveal her true identity to him. In The Charlatan (1757) the title character is relegated to the background, where he stands on top of a table surrounded by admiring women and a young boy. In the foreground, a masked woman seems to fiddle with her fan and slyly look at a masked man who lifts part of her dress. There is a sense of duality as the ordinary event of the man on the top of the table is contrasted with the reality of Venetian life represented by the couple indulging themselves; this is similar to the duality of the mask used by his subjects to hide physically, but to expose their unconscious desires. In The Ridotto in Venice (ca. 1750s), Longhi depicts one of the main gambling halls in Venice. The scene is crowded with masked and unmasked figures. The focal point in this work depicts a now-familiar scene of a shy woman and an aggressive man who lifts her dress. Repeating the figures of the flirtatious couple, Longhi displays the Ridotto as a place where the social elite— who would not exhibit such behavior in public nor unmasked—would abandon all inhibitions and pursue their actual desires.

Since January 1, 2011, under California law, candidates are voter-nominated for state and federal offices; political parties cannot nominate candidates for office. = California Assembly = In 1998, Mitchum was the Republican nominee in the general election for the California State Assembly in the 35th district, which included portions of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, where he served on the Republican Central Committee (1998–2000). His opponents were Democrat Hannah-Beth Jackson and Natural Law Party candidate Eric Dahl. Mitchum came in second behind Jackson with 44.5 percent of the vote to Jackson's 53 percent. = U.S. Congress = In 2012, Mitchum ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican candidate in California's 24th district (San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and part of Ventura counties), challenging incumbent Democrat Congresswoman Lois Capps. In the June 5, 2012 primary, he came in third, behind Republican Abel Maldonado and Capps, and ahead of Independent candidate Matt Boutté. In 2014, Mitchum ran again for the U.S. congressional seat held by Representative Capps. He won the June 3, 2014, primary (running alongside four other Republicans, two additional Democrats, and an Independent candidate), coming in second behind Capps with 15.8 percent of the vote, and narrowly defeating Republican Justin Fareed by slightly over 600 votes.U.S. House of Representatives District 24 District and County Results  Primary Election  California Secretary of State In the November 4 general election, Mitchum received 48.1 percent of the vote to Capps's 51.9 percent, in the closest race of Capps's entire congressional career. Despite the close margin by which Mitchum lost to Capps, as well as the announcement that Capps would retire in 2016, Mitchum ultimately declined a third run for the same seat again, and instead endorsed Assemblyman Katcho Achadjian for the race to succeed Capps.

He was the uncle of the senior Confederate General James Longstreet. Biography Longstreet was born in Augusta, Georgia, a son of the inventor William Longstreet. He graduated at Yale University in 1813, studied law in Litchfield, Connecticut, and was admitted to the bar in Richmond County, Georgia. He soon moved and rose to eminence as a lawyer in Greensboro, Georgia. He represented Greene County in the state legislature in 1821, and in 1822 became a district judge in Ocmulgee. After several years as a judge, he declined re-election and resumed his legal practice in Augusta, did editorial work, and established the Sentinel, which soon merged with the Chronicle (1838). In 1838, he became a Methodist minister. During this period of his ministry, the town was visited with yellow fever, but he remained at his post, ministering to the sick and dying. In 1839, he was made president of Emory College. After nine years he accepted the presidency of Centenary College, Louisiana, then of the University of Mississippi, where he stayed for six years, after which he resigned, and became a planter, but in 1857 became president of South Carolina College. Just before the Civil War, he returned to his old presidency in Mississippi. In politics he belonged to the Jeffersonian school of strict construction and states rights. He made speeches on all occasions through his life. “I have heard him,” writes one who knew him, “respond to a serenade, preach a funeral sermon, deliver a college commencement address, and make a harangue over the pyrotechnic glorifications of seceding states. He could never be scared up without a speech.” During his years as a Southern Methodist minister Longstreet preached a doctrine of secession and defended slavery. He was conspicuous in the discussions that led to a rupture of his church. Scholar Lewis M. Purifoy notes that \\"Augustus B. Longstreet, in a baccalaureate address to the University of South Carolina graduating class of 1859, urged the young men of his audience to defend Southern rights to the utmost. While they should not strive to break up the Union, they should not ‘make a dishonorable surrender of the thousandth part of the mill more to save it.’ He defended slavery mainly on the ground that freeing [slaves] would be ruinous to Southern society; and the burden of his speech was that the South had suffered long and grievously at the hand of the North. Longstreet assured the class that secession would not lead to war, but, if it should, a united South would win. Quotation is from p. 337. At an early age, he began to write for the press, and his pen was never idle. His chief periodical contributions are to be found in The Methodist Quarterly, Southern Literary Messenger, The Southern Field and Fireside, The Magnolia, and The Orion, and include “Letters to Clergymen of the Northern Methodist Church” and “Letters from Georgia to Massachusetts.” His fame is based, however, on a single book, of which he was the author: Georgia Scenes (1835), originally published in newspapers, then gathered into a volume at the South, and finally issued in 1840 in New York. It featured realistic sketches of Southern humor. It is said that he disavowed the second edition (1867) and tried to destroy the first. Augustus was a mentor for his nephew James Longstreet, and was a long-time friend and associate of John C. Calhoun. He died in Oxford, Mississippi and is buried in section one of St. Peter's Cemetery.Bayne, John Soward. 2012 .

The game follows a puppet named Headdy in his efforts to stop an evil puppet king from taking over his world. Headdy can throw his head at enemies to defeat them and use it to pull himself to various areas and move objects. The player can find a wide variety of \\"heads\\" which act as power-ups that provide different effects and alter gameplay. Critical reception to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics highlighted the game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other games in the platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building on the success of their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil. Gameplay Headdy fighting with Trouble Bruin early in the game Dynamite Headdy is a platform game in which the player controls Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head in any direction to attack enemies. His head can also be used to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life. During his adventure, Headdy will find power-ups which change the design and function of his head. These 17 power-ups range from increasing damage, such as spinning fireballs around his head, to providing invincibility, restoring health, increasing speed, etc. Some of these power-ups last for only a short time. Other than heads, the player can also find health restoratives, extra points, and extra lives throughout the levels. By finding the Liberty Head, players can enter a Bonus Stage in which the player must shoot basketballs into the correct hoops. Unlike other platform games where falling into a bottomless pit results instant death, if Headdy falls off, he will bounce back up which allows the player to put him back on a platform, though Headdy will still sustain some damage. Development and release After developing Gunstar Heroes, Treasure was divided into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, Yū Yū Hakusho Makyō Tōitsusen, and Dynamite Headdy. Inspiration for Dynamite Headdy came from Koichi Kimura, who wanted to work on an original project. Up to this point in his five-year career, Kimura had only worked on projects using the pre- existing works of others. (Translation) Kimura lead development, and president of Treasure, Masato Maegawa, served as head programmer. Kimura designed Dynamite Headdy to be commercially viable. He wanted the main character to attack with a part of its body, so he felt a puppet that could throw its head would be appealing. Not wanting Headdy to be a stereotypical lone hero, Kimura added support characters that appear in every stage. The game's visual design was inspired by Western animation and the work of film director Terry Gilliam. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, and several of the character and boss sprites were changed. Dynamite Headdy was originally released in Japan on 5 August 1994 for the Sega Genesis, with North American and European releases following in September and October respectively. A port was released for the Game Gear, and a Master System port based on the Game Gear version was released exclusively in Brazil. A 32X sequel was planned but canceled.Sega Power scan, Archived from the original on January 2, 2019 on the Wayback Machine. The game was included along with Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier in Sega Ages 2500: Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan. The compilation includes all versions of Dynamite Headdy released on all three Sega platforms across all regions. The game saw a digital re-release on the Wii via the Virtual Console in July 2007. It was also included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and was released on Steam on 2 May 2012. In 2018, it was included in the compilation Sega Genesis Classics (Sega Mega Drive Classics in PAL regions) for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Reception Dynamite Headdy received critical acclaim, with some believing it to be one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game's creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games said it \\"breathes new life\\" into the platform genre and stood up to the likes of the Sonic series. The staff at Mean Machines Sega found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at GamesMaster believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game's originality, critics praised Treasure's programming expertise and Dynamite Headdy's technical prowess. The staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the game's visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said \\"Dynamite Headdy is full of classic Treasure overstatement\\" and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The Mean Machines staff believed that Dynamite Headdy followed in the footsteps of Treasure's previous games and therefore confirmed the studio's technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and \\"patchy\\" and Mean Machines stating that it takes a few stages to truly find its footing. Critics found the Game Gear port to be well done given the system's less powerful technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called it one of the best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis version's playability came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he still believed Treasure was able to create a fun 8-bit port. In retrospective reviews of the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing the same level of excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era and one of the best platformers on the system.

Here {mathcal O}(X) is the partial order of open sets of X ordered by inclusion maps; and considered as a category in the standard way, with a unique morphism :U rightarrow V if U is a subset of V, and none otherwise. As phrased in the sheaf article, there is a certain axiom that F must satisfy, for any open cover of an open set of X. For example, given open sets U and V with union X and intersection W, the required condition is that :{mathcal F}(X) is the subset of {mathcal F}(U) times {mathcal F}(V) With equal image in {mathcal F}(W) In less formal language, a section s of F over X is equally well given by a pair of sections :(s', s) on U and V respectively, which 'agree' in the sense that s' and s have a common image in {mathcal F}(W) under the respective restriction maps :{mathcal F}(U) rightarrow {mathcal F}(W) and :{mathcal F}(V) rightarrow {mathcal F}(W). The first major hurdle in sheaf theory is to see that this gluing or patching axiom is a correct abstraction from the usual idea in geometric situations. For example, a vector field is a section of a tangent bundle on a smooth manifold; this says that a vector field on the union of two open sets is (no more and no less than) vector fields on the two sets that agree where they overlap. Given this basic understanding, there are further issues in the theory, and some will be addressed here. A different direction is that of the Grothendieck topology, and yet another is the logical status of 'local existence' (see Kripke–Joyal semantics). Removing restrictions on C To rephrase this definition in a way that will work in any category C that has sufficient structure, we note that we can write the objects and morphisms involved in the definition above in a diagram which we will call (G), for \\"gluing\\": :{mathcal F}(U)rightarrowprod_i{mathcal F}(U_i)prod_{i,j}{mathcal F}(U_icap U_j) Here the first map is the product of the restriction maps :{res}_{U,U_{i}}:{mathcal F}(U)rightarrow{mathcal F}(U_{i}) and each pair of arrows represents the two restrictions :res_{U_i,U_icap U_j}:{mathcal F}(U_i)rightarrow{mathcal F}(U_icap U_j) and :res_{U_j,U_icap U_j}:{mathcal F}(U_j)rightarrow{mathcal F}(U_icap U_j). It is worthwhile to note that these maps exhaust all of the possible restriction maps among U, the U_i, and the U_icap U_j. The condition for mathcal F to be a sheaf is exactly that mathcal F is the limit of the diagram. This suggests the correct form of the gluing axiom: :A presheaf mathcal F is a sheaf if for any open set U and any collection of open sets {U_i}_{iin I} whose union is U, {mathcal F}(U) is the limit of the diagram (G) above. One way of understanding the gluing axiom is to notice that \\"un-applying\\" mathcal F to (G) yields the following diagram: :coprod_{i,j}U_icap U_jcoprod_iU_irightarrow U Here U is the colimit of this diagram. The gluing axiom says that mathcal F turns colimits of such diagrams into limits. Sheaves on a basis of open sets In some categories, it is possible to construct a sheaf by specifying only some of its sections. Specifically, let X be a topological space with basis { B_i }_{i in I}. We can define a category to be the full subcategory of {mathcal O}(X) whose objects are the { B_i }. A B-sheaf on X with values in C is a contravariant functor :{mathcal F}:{mathcal O}'(X) rightarrow C which satisfies the gluing axiom for sets in {mathcal O}'(X). That is, on a selection of open sets of X, mathcal F specifies all of the sections of a sheaf, and on the other open sets, it is undetermined. B-sheaves are equivalent to sheaves (that is, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the category of B-sheaves).Vakil, Math 216: Foundations of algebraic geometry, 2.7. Clearly a sheaf on X can be restricted to a B-sheaf. In the other direction, given a B-sheaf mathcal F we must determine the sections of mathcal F on the other objects of {mathcal O}(X). To do this, note that for each open set U, we can find a collection { B_j }_{j in J} whose union is U. Categorically speaking, this choice makes U the colimit of the full subcategory of {mathcal O}'(X) whose objects are { B_j }_{j in J}. Since mathcal F is contravariant, we define {mathcal F}'(U) to be the limit of the { {mathcal F}(B) }_{j in J} with respect to the restriction maps. (Here we must assume that this limit exists in C.) If U is a basic open set, then U is a terminal object of the above subcategory of {mathcal O}'(X), and hence {mathcal F}'(U) = {mathcal F}(U). Therefore, {mathcal F}' extends mathcal F to a presheaf on X. It can be verified that {mathcal F}' is a sheaf, essentially because every element of every open cover of X is a union of basis elements (by the definition of a basis), and every pairwise intersection of elements in an open cover of X is a union of basis elements (again by the definition of a basis). The logic of C The first needs of sheaf theory were for sheaves of abelian groups; so taking the category C as the category of abelian groups was only natural. In applications to geometry, for example complex manifolds and algebraic geometry, the idea of a sheaf of local rings is central. This, however, is not quite the same thing; one speaks instead of a locally ringed space, because it is not true, except in trite cases, that such a sheaf is a functor into a category of local rings. It is the stalks of the sheaf that are local rings, not the collections of sections (which are rings, but in general are not close to being local). We can think of a locally ringed space X as a parametrised family of local rings, depending on x in X. A more careful discussion dispels any mystery here. One can speak freely of a sheaf of abelian groups, or rings, because those are algebraic structures (defined, if one insists, by an explicit signature). Any category C having finite products supports the idea of a group object, which some prefer just to call a group in C. In the case of this kind of purely algebraic structure, we can talk either of a sheaf having values in the category of abelian groups, or an abelian group in the category of sheaves of sets; it really doesn't matter. In the local ring case, it does matter. At a foundational level we must use the second style of definition, to describe what a local ring means in a category. This is a logical matter: axioms for a local ring require use of existential quantification, in the form that for any r in the ring, one of r and 1-r is invertible. This allows one to specify what a 'local ring in a category' should be, in the case that the category supports enough structure. Sheafification To turn a given presheaf mathcal P into a sheaf mathcal F, there is a standard device called sheafification or sheaving. The rough intuition of what one should do, at least for a presheaf of sets, is to introduce an equivalence relation, which makes equivalent data given by different covers on the overlaps by refining the covers. One approach is therefore to go to the stalks and recover the sheaf space of the best possible sheaf mathcal F produced from mathcal P. This use of language strongly suggests that we are dealing here with adjoint functors. Therefore, it makes sense to observe that the sheaves on X form a full subcategory of the presheaves on X. Implicit in that is the statement that a morphism of sheaves is nothing more than a natural transformation of the sheaves, considered as functors. Therefore, we get an abstract characterisation of sheafification as left adjoint to the inclusion. In some applications, naturally, one does need a description. In more abstract language, the sheaves on X form a reflective subcategory of the presheaves (Mac Lane–Moerdijk Sheaves in Geometry and Logic p. 86). In topos theory, for a Lawvere–Tierney topology and its sheaves, there is an analogous result (ibid. p. 227). Other gluing axioms The gluing axiom of sheaf theory is rather general. One can note that the Mayer–Vietoris axiom of homotopy theory, for example, is a special case.

The inhabitants are known as Longoviciens. Economy Longwy has historically been an industrial center of the Lorraine iron mining district. The town is known for its artistic faience, produced there since 1798, and carried on today by the Société des faïenceries de Longwy et Senelle, often in cooperation with artists and ceramists. Overglaze enamel decoration, often in a manner similar to cloisonné, has been produced in Longwy ceramics since 1872,Emaux de Longwy, initially under the direction of Amadeo de Carenza; these decors reached a peak in the Art Deco style, retailed by the Parisian department store Printemps.Historique: émaux et faïences History Destruction of Longwy France 1914 Longwy initially belonged to Lotharingia. After the division of that kingdom, the town became part of Upper Lorraine and ultimately the Duchy of Bar. Longwy was ceded to Wenceslaus I of Luxembourg in 1368, but was returned to Bar in 1378. The Duchy of Bar was then annexed into the Duchy of Lorraine in 1480. From 1648 to 1660 Longwy was part of the Kingdom of France, returning to the Duchy of Lorraine afterwards. It was made part of France again in 1670, a situation which was finalized in the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678. Vauban fortified the town during the reign of Louis XIV, having demolished the medieval Château de Longwy, of which one tower remains. After the French defeat in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870–71, almost all of the Moselle department, along with Alsace and portions of the Meurthe and Vosges departments, was ceded to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt on the ground that the population in those areas spoke German dialects. Only one-fifth of Moselle, including Longwy, was spared annexation. Otto von Bismarck later bitterly regretted his decision when it was discovered that the region of Briey and Longwy was rich with iron ore, exploited by the Aciéries de Longwy among other members of the cartel Comptoir Métallurgique de Longwy. After the Battle of the Ardennes in August 1914, Longwy was occupied by the Imperial German army until the 1918 Armistice.

History = Creation = Following World War I, in 1928, the Departments of Pensions and National Health became responsible for caring for ill and injured soldiers returning from that war. Following World War II, the volume of soldiers returning home made it clear that the Government of Canada would require a department dedicated to serving ill and injured veterans. This first came by changing the department to the \\"Department of Pensions\\" and creating Health Canada under a separate Ministry. That same year, Prime Minister Mackenzie King's Parliament passed a motion that officially created Veterans Affairs Canada. Canada operated a benefits program similar to the American G.I. Bill for its World War II veterans, with a strong economic impact similar to the American case.Thomas Lemieux, and David Card. \\"Education, earnings, and the 'Canadian GI Bill,;\\" Canadian Journal of Economics/Revue canadienne d'économique (2001) 34#2 pp: 313-344. online A war veteran's eligibility for certain benefits depended on the veteran's \\"overseas\\" status, defined by Veterans Affairs as having served at least two miles offshore from Canada. In the Second World War (1939–45) Canada did not yet include Newfoundland, which became a Canadian province only in 1949. Thus World War I or World War II veterans who served in Newfoundland (with Royal Newfoundland Regiment and Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve) are considered by Veterans Affairs to be \\"overseas veterans\\" (and as such may be referred to the British Service Personnel and Veterans Agency). In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau undertook an initiative to decentralize government away from Ottawa. He and his Minister of Veterans Affairs, Daniel J. MacDonald (Member of Parliament for Cardigan) devised the plan to move the headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs from Ottawa to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The department's head office has been located in the Daniel J. MacDonald Building in PEI's capital ever since. In the early 21st century, a second building two blocks from the DJM called the Jean Canfield Building, was constructed to house other federal government offices, including some from Veterans Affairs Canada. The department has become a major economic contributor to PEI, and has had an important impact on Charlottetown's cultural landscape. Veterans Affairs Canada is the only major federal department whose headquarters is located outside of Ottawa. = Programs = The department is largely responsible for medical care, rehabilitation, commemoration, and disability pensions and awards for Veterans. Appeals from departmental decisions on disability pensions and awards are presented by Veterans to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board; Veterans Affairs Canada provides Veterans appearing before the Board with the assistance of lawyers from the semi-autonomous Bureau of Pensions Advocates free of charge. = Veterans' Bill of Rights = In 2007, the Veterans' Bill of Rights was passed by the Harper government. The bill included a statement that Veterans Affairs Canada must show veterans respect.http://www.vrab- tacra.gc.ca/Images/bill_of_rights_declaration_des_droits.pdf = 2010 Privacy Breach = In October 2010, federal Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart found that a veteran's privacy had been violated by VAC. She found that the confidential medical information of Sean Bruyea, a medically-released Captain, had found its way into the hands of numerous departmental officials, which she said was \\"deeply concerning\\" and a violation of the Privacy Act. Bruyea's information was leaked after his criticisms of the New Veterans Charter and the way Afghanistan veterans were being treated by the government.Privacy watchdog blasts Veterans Affairs, The Globe and Mail, October 7, 2010 accessed October 9, 2010 The Government of Canada apologized for its privacy breach and settled a $400,000 privacy breach suit in November 2010. =Christopher Garnier Case= In 2018, controversy arose when it was discovered that convicted murderer, Christopher Garnier, was receiving Veterans Affairs Canada funded treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Garnier had been convicted of the 2015 murder of off-duty Police Constable Catherine Campbell in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The controversy stemmed from the fact Garnier had never served in the Canadian armed forces or RCMP and the PTSD was said to be brought on by the murder for which he was convicted. Garnier was eligible for Veterans Affairs Canada benefits as his father had served in the armed forces. Remembrance initiatives The Canada Remembers program is responsible for all war commemoration activities, such as Remembrance Day, and coordinates and funds various \\"pilgrimages\\" for Canadian war veterans to foreign battlefields and international ceremonies (e.g. the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands in early 1995, the 60th anniversary of D Day on June 6, 2004). The Government of Canada declared 2005 the Year of the Veteran. Its purpose was to teach, remember, thank, honour and celebrate. The image of a poppy overlapping a gold maple leaf became a special symbol during the campaign, on posters, pamphlets, bookmarks and documents. On November 9, 2008, the Honourable Greg Thompson, the-then Minister of Veterans Affairs, attended a Service of Remembrance at the Canada Memorial in Green Park, London, England, which Canada had recently assumed responsibility for; the memorial pays tribute to the nearly one million Canadian men and women who served in the United Kingdom during the First and Second World Wars.

The result was a number of out-dated policies that no longer suited the needs of Canada's veterans. This program gave a life-time pension to an individual who was ill or injured due to military service. In 2005, all parties in the House of Commons passed the New Veterans Charter. This Charter replaced the life-time pension award with a lump sum payment award and used life-time pension payments much more sparingly. The Charter came into force on 1 April 2006 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper's minority government. Under the New Veterans Charter, an ill or injured member may receive a lump sum payment of a maximum of $550,000 tax-free, ($300,000 lump sum and $250,000 disbursement insurance) as well as a maximum monthly, taxable pension of $9685. In July 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Julian Fantino as the Minister of Veterans Affairs. Fantino quickly indicated that he was open to amending the New Veterans Charter to ensure veterans received the benefits and support they deserved. In the spring of 2014, the all-party Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs met to discuss updates to the New Veterans Charter. The result was the unanimously-supported report titled The New Veterans Charter: Moving Forward, which was tabled in Parliament in June 2014. The committee made 13 recommendations to update the New Veterans Charter to close loopholes and ensure Canada's veterans would continue to receive the support and care that they deserve. In October 2014, the government responded, saying they agreed with the \\"spirit and intent\\" of all 13 recommendations and would begin working on the recommendations immediately. =Mobile Application= Veterans Affairs Canada has recently launched a suite of mobile applications aimed at aiding Veterans with accessing services offered by VAC.

In concurrent programming, an operation (or set of operations) is linearizable if it consists of an ordered list of invocation and response events (callbacks), that may be extended by adding response events such that: # The extended list can be re-expressed as a sequential history (is serializable), and # That sequential history is a subset of the original unextended list. Informally, this means that the unmodified list of events is linearizable if and only if its invocations were serializable, but some of the responses of the serial schedule have yet to return. In a concurrent system, processes can access a shared object at the same time. Because multiple processes are accessing a single object, there may arise a situation in which while one process is accessing the object, another process changes its contents. This example demonstrates the need for linearizability. In a linearizable system although operations overlap on a shared object, each operation appears to take place instantaneously. Linearizability is a strong correctness condition, which constrains what outputs are possible when an object is accessed by multiple processes concurrently. It is a safety property which ensures that operations do not complete in an unexpected or unpredictable manner. If a system is linearizable it allows a programmer to reason about the system.  History of linearizability  Linearizability was first introduced as a consistency model by Herlihy and Wing in 1987. It encompassed more restrictive definitions of atomic, such as \\"an atomic operation is one which cannot be (or is not) interrupted by concurrent operations\\", which are usually vague about when an operation is considered to begin and end. An atomic object can be understood immediately and completely from its sequential definition, as a set of operations run in parallel which always appear to occur one after the other; no inconsistencies may emerge. Specifically, linearizability guarantees that the invariants of a system are observed and preserved by all operations: if all operations individually preserve an invariant, the system as a whole will.  Definition of linearizability  A concurrent system consists of a collection of processes communicating through shared data structures or objects. Linearizability is important in these concurrent systems where objects may be accessed by multiple processes at the same time and a programmer needs to be able to reason about the expected results. An execution of a concurrent system results in a history, an ordered sequence of completed operations. A history is a sequence of invocations and responses made of an object by a set of threads or processes. An invocation can be thought of as the start of an operation, and the response being the signaled end of that operation. Each invocation of a function will have a subsequent response. This can be used to model any use of an object. Suppose, for example, that two threads, A and B, both attempt to grab a lock, backing off if it's already taken. This would be modeled as both threads invoking the lock operation, then both threads receiving a response, one successful, one not. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  A invokes lock  B invokes lock  A gets \\"failed\\" response  B gets \\"successful\\" response } A sequential history is one in which all invocations have immediate responses, that is the invocation and response are considered to take place instantaneously. A sequential history should be trivial to reason about, as it has no real concurrency; the previous example was not sequential, and thus is hard to reason about. This is where linearizability comes in. A history sigma is linearizable if there is a linear order of the completed operations such that: # For every completed operation in sigma, the operation returns the same result in the execution as the operation would return if every operation was completed one by one in order sigma. # If an operation op1 completes (gets a response) before op2 begins (invokes), then op1 precedes op2 in sigma. In other words: * its invocations and responses can be reordered to yield a sequential history; * that sequential history is correct according to the sequential definition of the object; * if a response preceded an invocation in the original history, it must still precede it in the sequential reordering. (Note that the first two bullet points here match serializability: the operations appear to happen in some order. It is the last point which is unique to linearizability, and is thus the major contribution of Herlihy and Wing.) Let us look at two ways of reordering the locking example above. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  A invokes lock  A gets \\"failed\\" response  B invokes lock  B gets \\"successful\\" response } Reordering B's invocation below A's response yields a sequential history. This is easy to reason about, as all operations now happen in an obvious order. Unfortunately, it doesn't match the sequential definition of the object (it doesn't match the semantics of the program): A should have successfully obtained the lock, and B should have subsequently aborted. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  B invokes lock  B gets \\"successful\\" response  A invokes lock  A gets \\"failed\\" response } This is another correct sequential history. It is also a linearization! Note that the definition of linearizability only precludes responses that precede invocations from being reordered; since the original history had no responses before invocations, we can reorder it as we wish. Hence the original history is indeed linearizable. An object (as opposed to a history) is linearizable if all valid histories of its use can be linearized. Note that this is a much harder assertion to prove. = Linearizability versus serializability = Consider the following history, again of two objects interacting with a lock: { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  A invokes lock  A successfully locks  B invokes unlock  B successfully unlocks  A invokes unlock  A successfully unlocks } This history is not valid because there is a point at which both A and B hold the lock; moreover, it cannot be reordered to a valid sequential history without violating the ordering rule. Therefore, it is not linearizable. However, under serializability, B's unlock operation may be moved to before A's original lock, which is a valid history (assuming the object begins the history in a locked state): { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  B invokes unlock  B successfully unlocks  A invokes lock  A successfully locks  A invokes unlock  A successfully unlocks } This reordering is sensible provided there is no alternative means of communicating between A and B. Linearizability is better when considering individual objects separately, as the reordering restrictions ensure that multiple linearizable objects are, considered as a whole, still linearizable. = Linearization points = This definition of linearizability is equivalent to the following: * All function calls have a linearization point at some instant between their invocation and their response. * All functions appear to occur instantly at their linearization point, behaving as specified by the sequential definition. This alternative is usually much easier to prove. It is also much easier to reason about as a user, largely due to its intuitiveness. This property of occurring instantaneously, or indivisibly, leads to the use of the term atomic as an alternative to the longer \\"linearizable\\". In the examples below, the linearization point of the counter built on compare-and-swap is the linearization point of the first (and only) successful compare-and-swap update. The counter built using locking can be considered to linearize at any moment while the locks are held, since any potentially conflicting operations are excluded from running during that period.  Primitive atomic instructions  Processors have instructions that can be used to implement locking and lock-free and wait-free algorithms. The ability to temporarily inhibit interrupts, ensuring that the currently running process cannot be context switched, also suffices on a uniprocessor. These instructions are used directly by compiler and operating system writers but are also abstracted and exposed as bytecodes and library functions in higher-level languages: * atomic read-write; * atomic swap (the RDLK instruction in some Burroughs mainframes, and the XCHG x86 instruction); * test-and-set; * fetch-and-add; * compare-and- swap; * load-link/store-conditional. Most processors include store operations that are not atomic with respect to memory. These include multiple-word stores and string operations. Should a high priority interrupt occur when a portion of the store is complete, the operation must be completed when the interrupt level is returned. The routine that processes the interrupt must not access the memory being changed. It is important to take this into account when writing interrupt routines. When there are multiple instructions which must be completed without interruption, a CPU instruction which temporarily disables interrupts is used. This must be kept to only a few instructions and the interrupts must be re-enabled to avoid unacceptable response time to interrupts or even losing interrupts. This mechanism is not sufficient in a multi-processor environment since each CPU can interfere with the process regardless of whether interrupts occur or not. Further, in the presence of an instruction pipeline, uninterruptible operations present a security risk, as they can potentially be chained in an infinite loop to create a denial of service attack, as in the Cyrix coma bug. The C standard and SUSv3 provide \`sig_atomic_t\` for simple atomic reads and writes; incrementing or decrementing is not guaranteed to be atomic. More complex atomic operations are available in C11, which provides \`stdatomic.h\`. Compilers use the hardware features or more complex methods to implement the operations; an example is libatomic of GCC. The ARM instruction set provides \`LDREX\` and \`STREX\` instructions which can be used to implement atomic memory access by using exclusive monitors implemented in the processor to track memory accesses for a specific address. However, if a context switch occurs between calls to \`LDREX\` and \`STREX\`, the documentation notes that \`STREX\` will fail, indicating the operation should be retried.  High-level atomic operations  The easiest way to achieve linearizability is running groups of primitive operations in a critical section. Strictly, independent operations can then be carefully permitted to overlap their critical sections, provided this does not violate linearizability. Such an approach must balance the cost of large numbers of locks against the benefits of increased parallelism. Another approach, favoured by researchers (but not yet widely used in the software industry), is to design a linearizable object using the native atomic primitives provided by the hardware. This has the potential to maximise available parallelism and minimise synchronisation costs, but requires mathematical proofs which show that the objects behave correctly. A promising hybrid of these two is to provide a transactional memory abstraction. As with critical sections, the user marks sequential code that must be run in isolation from other threads. The implementation then ensures the code executes atomically. This style of abstraction is common when interacting with databases; for instance, when using the Spring Framework, annotating a method with @Transactional will ensure all enclosed database interactions occur in a single database transaction. Transactional memory goes a step further, ensuring that all memory interactions occur atomically. As with database transactions, issues arise regarding composition of transactions, especially database and in-memory transactions. A common theme when designing linearizable objects is to provide an all-or-nothing interface: either an operation succeeds completely, or it fails and does nothing. (ACID databases refer to this principle as atomicity.) If the operation fails (usually due to concurrent operations), the user must retry, usually performing a different operation. For example: * Compare-and- swap writes a new value into a location only if the latter's contents matches a supplied old value. This is commonly used in a read-modify-CAS sequence: the user reads the location, computes a new value to write, and writes it with a CAS (compare-and-swap); if the value changes concurrently, the CAS will fail and the user tries again. * Load-link/store-conditional encodes this pattern more directly: the user reads the location with load-link, computes a new value to write, and writes it with store-conditional; if the value has changed concurrently, the SC (store-conditional) will fail and the user tries again. * In a database transaction, if the transaction cannot be completed due to a concurrent operation (e.g. in a deadlock), the transaction will be aborted and the user must try again.  Examples of linearizability  = Counters = To demonstrate the power and necessity of linearizability we will consider a simple counter which different processes can increment. We would like to implement a counter object which multiple processes can access. Many common systems make use of counters to keep track of the number of times an event has occurred. The counter object can be accessed by multiple processes and has two available operations. # Increment - adds 1 to the value stored in the counter, return acknowledgement # Read - returns the current value stored in the counter without changing it. We will attempt to implement this counter object using shared registers Our first attempt which we will see is non-linearizable has the following implementation using one shared register among the processes.  Non-atomic  The naive, non-atomic implementation: Increment: # Read the value in the register R # Add one to the value # Writes the new value back into register R Read: Read register R This simple implementation is not linearizable, as is demonstrated by the following example. Imagine two processes are running accessing the single counter object initialized to have value 0: # The first process reads the value in the register as 0. # The first process adds one to the value, the counter's value should be 1, but before it has finished writing the new value back to the register it may become suspended, meanwhile the second process is running: # The second process reads the value in the register, which is still equal to 0; # The second process adds one to the value; # the second process writes the new value into the register, the register now has value 1. The second process is finished running and the first process continues running from where it left off: # The first process writes 1 into the register, unaware that the other process has already updated the value in the register to 1. In the above example, two processes invoked an increment command, however the value of the object only increased from 0 to 1, instead of 2 as it should have. One of the increment operations was lost as a result of the system not being linearizable. The above example shows the need for carefully thinking through implementations of data structures and how linearizability can have an effect on the correctness of the system.  Atomic  To implement a linearizable or atomic counter object we will modify our previous implementation so each process Pi will use its own register Ri Each process increments and reads according to the following algorithm: Increment: # Read value in register Ri. # Add one to the value. # Write new value back into Ri Read: # Read registers R1, R2, ... Rn. # Return the sum of all registers. This implementation solves the problem with our original implementation. In this system the increment operations are linearized at the write step. The linearization point of an increment operation is when that operation writes the new value in its register Ri. The read operations are linearized to a point in the system when the value returned by the read is equal to the sum of all the values stored in each register Ri. This is a trivial example. In a real system, the operations can be more complex and the errors introduced extremely subtle. For example, reading a 64-bit value from memory may actually be implemented as two sequential reads of two 32-bit memory locations. If a process has only read the first 32 bits, and before it reads the second 32 bits the value in memory gets changed, it will have neither the original value nor the new value but a mixed-up value. Furthermore, the specific order in which the processes run can change the results, making such an error difficult to detect, reproduce and debug. = Compare-and-swap = Most systems provide an atomic compare-and- swap instruction that reads from a memory location, compares the value with an \\"expected\\" one provided by the user, and writes out a \\"new\\" value if the two match, returning whether the update succeeded. We can use this to fix the non- atomic counter algorithm as follows: :# Read the value in the memory location; :# add one to the value; :# use compare-and-swap to write the incremented value back; :# retry if the value read in by the compare-and-swap did not match the value we originally read. Since the compare-and-swap occurs (or appears to occur) instantaneously, if another process updates the location while we are in-progress, the compare-and-swap is guaranteed to fail. = Fetch-and-increment = Many systems provide an atomic fetch-and-increment instruction that reads from a memory location, unconditionally writes a new value (the old value plus one), and returns the old value. We can use this to fix the non-atomic counter algorithm as follows: :# Use fetch-and-increment to read the old value and write the incremented value back. Using fetch-and increment is always better (requires fewer memory references) for some algorithms—such as the one shown here—than compare-and-swap, even though Herlihy earlier proved that compare-and-swap is better for certain other algorithms that can't be implemented at all using only fetch-and-increment. So CPU designs with both fetch-and-increment and compare-and-swap (or equivalent instructions) may be a better choice than ones with only one or the other. = Locking = Another approach is to turn the naive algorithm into a critical section, preventing other threads from disrupting it, using a lock. Once again fixing the non-atomic counter algorithm: :# Acquire a lock, excluding other threads from running the critical section (steps 2-4) at the same time; :# read the value in the memory location; :# add one to the value; :# write the incremented value back to the memory location; :# release the lock. This strategy works as expected; the lock prevents other threads from updating the value until it is released. However, when compared with direct use of atomic operations, it can suffer from significant overhead due to lock contention. To improve program performance, it may therefore be a good idea to replace simple critical sections with atomic operations for non-blocking synchronization (as we have just done for the counter with compare-and-swap and fetch-and- increment), instead of the other way around, but unfortunately a significant improvement is not guaranteed and lock-free algorithms can easily become too complicated to be worth the effort.

The Autopen Model 50 from the International Autopen Company was used extensively by John F. Kennedy's White House to duplicate his signature. An autopen or signing machine is a device used for the automatic signing of a signature or autograph. Many celebrities, politicians and public figures receive hundreds of letters a day, many of which request a personal reply; this leads to a situation in which either the individual must artificially reproduce their signature or heavily limit the number of recipients who receive a personal response. Given the exact verisimilitude to the real hand signature, the use of the autopen allows for a small degree of wishful thinking and plausible deniability as to whether a famous autograph is real or reproduced, thus increasing the perception of the personal value of the signature by the lay recipient. However, known or suspected autopen signatures are also vastly less valuable as philographic collectibles; legitimate hand- signed documents from individuals known to also use an autopen usually require verification and provenance to be considered valid. The early autopens used a plastic matrix of the original signature which is a channel cut into an engraved plate in the shape of a wheel. A stylus driven by an electric motor followed the x- and y-axis of a profile or shape engraved in the plate (which is why it is called a matrix). The stylus is mechanically connected to an arm which can hold almost any common writing instrument, so the favourite pen and ink can be used to suggest authenticity. The autopen signature is made with even pressure (and indentation in the paper), which is how these machines are distinguishable from original handwriting where the pressure varies. Modern day autopens use a signature smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases instead of the plastic matrices. In addition, certain models can replicate entire pages of writing once a custom font has been created in a user's handwriting. History The first signature duplicating machines were developed by an Englishman named John Isaac Hawkins. Hawkins received a United States patent for his device in 1803. In 1804, Thomas Jefferson began using the device extensively. This early device was known at the time as a polygraph (an abstracted version of the pantograph) and bears little resemblance to today's autopens in design or operation. The autopen called the Robot Pen was developed in the 1930s, and became commercially available in 1937 (used as a storage unit device, similar in principle to how vinyl records store information) to record a signer's signature. A small segment of the record could be removed and stored elsewhere to prevent misuse. The machine would then be able to mass-produce a template signature when needed. While the Robot Pen was commercially available, the first commercially successful autopen was developed by Robert M. De Shazo, Jr., in 1942. De Shazo developed the technology that became the modern autopen in reference to a Request For Quote (RFQ) from the Navy, and in 1942, received an order for the machine from the Secretary of the Navy. This was the beginning of a significant market in government for the autopen, as the machines soon ended up in the offices of members of Congress, the Senate and the Executive branches. At one point, De Shazo estimated there were more than 500 autopens in use in Washington, D.C. In 2005, the U.S. Justice Department issued a legal opinion upholding the right of the U.S. President to sign bills by autopen. Users Confidentiality is extremely important to autopen owners and most will not divulge whether they own one or not. Some say Harry Truman was the first United States President to use the Autopen as a way of responding to mail and signing checks. Others credit Gerald Ford as the first President to openly acknowledge his use of the Autopen, but Lyndon Johnson allowed photographs of his autopen to be taken while he was in office, and in 1968 the National Enquirer ran them along with the front-page headline \\"The Robot That Sits In For The President.\\" Autopen devices are used today by politicians and fundraisers to sign letters to constituents written by administrative assistants and clerical staff, and by other famous people to sign autographs. While visiting France, US President Barack Obama authorized the use of an autopen to create his signature which signed into law an extension of three provisions of the Patriot Act. On January 3, 2013, he signed the extension to the Bush tax cuts, using the Autopen while vacationing in Hawaii. In order to sign it by the required deadline, his other alternative would have been to have had the bill flown to him overnight. Republican leaders have questioned whether this use of the Autopen meets the Constitutional requirement for signing a bill into law, but the validity of presidential use of an autopen has not been actually tested in court. During his term in office, President George W. Bush asked for and received a favorable opinion from the Department of Justice regarding the constitutionality of using the autopen, but did not use it himself. Similar devices Further developing the class of devices known as autopens, Canadian author Margaret Atwood created a device called the LongPen, which allows audio and video conversation between the fan and author while a book is being signed remotely.

The coaching inn (also coaching house or staging inn) was a vital part of Europe's inland transport infrastructure until the development of the railway, providing a resting point for people and horses. The inn served the needs of travellers, for food, drink, and rest. The attached stables, staffed by hostlers, cared for the horses, including changing a tired team for a fresh one. Coaching inns were used by private travellers in their coaches, the public riding stagecoaches between one town and another, and (in England at least) the mail coach. Just as with roadhouses in other countries, although many survive, and some still offer overnight accommodation, in general coaching inns have lost their original function and now operate as ordinary pubs. Coaching inns stabled teams of horses for stagecoaches and mail coaches and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. In America, stage stations performed these functions. Traditionally English coaching inns were seven miles apart but this depended very much on the terrain. Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the passengers. Barnet, Hertfordshire still has an unusually high number of historic pubs along its high street due to its former position on the Great North Road from London to the North of England. Historic inns The George Inn, Southwark is the only galleried coaching inn to survive in London There were many coaching inns in what is now central London. The only remaining one with the galleries to the bedrooms above is The George Inn, Southwark, owned by the National Trust and still run as a pub. Many have been demolished and plaques mark their location. The Nomura building close to the Museum of London on London Wall commemorates the \\"Bull and Mouth\\" Inn; Golden Cross House, opposite St Martin's in the Fields recalls the Golden Cross, Charing Cross coaching inn. Historic inns in Oxford include The Bear Inn (originally established in 1242) and the Lamb & Flag. Those in Wales include the Black Boy Inn (built 1522) and the Groes Inn (1573). The Black Lion in Cardigan (established 1105) is probably the oldest Welsh coaching inn. Cock and Bull Pub signs of the Cock and the Bull A pair of coaching inns on Watling Street are said to have given rise to the term \\"cock and bull stories.\\" Coaches stopped in Stony Stratford as they made their way along the old Roman road from London to the North, and many a traveller's tall tale would be further embellished as it passed between the two hostelries, \\"The Cock\\" and \\"The Bull\\", fuelled by ale and an interested audience. Hence any suspiciously elaborate tale would become a cock and bull story. This is a cock and bull story in itself, however; as there is no evidence to suggest that this is where the phrase originated. The phrase, first recorded in 1621, may instead be an allusion to Aesop's fables, with their incredible talking animals. As this slightly predates coaching inns, the names of the two inns could have been a reference to \\"Cock and Bull stories\\" as to encourage the passing of such anecdotes within their doors.

He was a charter member of the International Academy of Sex Research. During his academic career, he served on a number of editorial boards and served as chair of multiple professional society committees. He was an invited speaker at more than a dozen symposia and other events, and was a guest on four TV shows. Humphreys married Nancy Wallace, a woman from a prominent Tulsa family in 1960. The couple had two children, Claire and David.Humphreys, Laud. (1970 (2009)). Tearoom trade: Impersonal sex in public places. Aldine Transaction. In 1974, Humphreys came out as a gay man during a discussion at a conference session at the ASA. Humphreys was a co-founder of the Sociologists' Gay Caucus, (now the Committee on the Status of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer People in Sociology), established in 1974 as a response to a presentation by Edward Sagarin that criticized homosexual sociologists as hiding in the closet. Humphreys separated from his wife in 1980 and began living with Brian Miller, a graduate student at the University of Alberta. That same year, he was certified to practice as a psychotherapist in California. For most of the rest of his life, he was in private practice, although he and Miller co-authored articles about gay subcultures and victims of violent homophobia. He was professor of sociology at Pitzer College in Claremont, California from 1972–1988 and died of lung cancer in 1988, aged 57. = Biography and papers = His biography, written by John F. Galliher, Wayne H. Brekhus, and David P. Keys, was published in 2004, under the title Laud Humphreys: Prophet of Homosexuality and Sociology. The authors establish the case that Humphreys was an extremely complex person and that he was professionally marginalized in the discipline of sociology. The book also heralds his contributions to the discipline of sociology, as well as his advocacy for African American civil rights, gay rights, and against war. The University of Southern California houses the Laud Humphreys Papers Collection, as part of the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives. Tearoom Trade Humphreys is best known for his published Ph.D. dissertation, Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places (1970), an ethnographic study of anonymous male-male sexual encounters in public toilets (a practice known as \\"tea- rooming\\" in US gay slang and \\"cottaging\\" in British English). Humphreys asserted that the men participating in such activity came from diverse social backgrounds, had differing personal motives for seeking sexual partners in such venues, and variously self-perceived as \\"straight,\\" \\"bisexual,\\" or \\"gay.\\" Because Humphreys was able to confirm that over 50% of his subjects identified as heterosexual men who were married to women, a primary thesis of Tearoom Trade is the incongruence between the private self and the social self for many of the men engaging in this form of homosexual activity. Specifically, they put on a \\"breastplate of righteousness\\" (social and political conservatism) in an effort to conceal their sexual behavior and prevent being exposed as deviants. Humphreys tapped into a theme of incongruence between one's words and deeds that has become a primary methodological and theoretical concern in sociology throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Humphreys' study has been criticized by sociologists and other social and behavioral scientists on ethical grounds in that he observed sexual acts by masquerading as a voyeur, \\"did not get his subjects’ consent, tracked down names and addresses through license plate numbers, and interviewed the men in their homes in disguise and under false pretenses.\\" According to Jack Nusan Porter, a sociologist who knew Humphreys and studied under Howard S. Becker at Northwestern University from 1967-1971, \\"Humphreys was enormously influential on graduate students and younger scholars in the field of deviance, ethnography, and what we called 'participant observation'. True, today one could not do such research because there was no 'informed consent' but then again, in many cases, when doing research on deviant behavior, one will never get 'informed consent' so we miss out on a lot of important findings. He was a true pioneer and a hero to all of us in these fields.\\" Humphreys' research materials, including detailed diagrams and maps of tearoom activity he observed, are housed in the collections at ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives. By 2004, Tearoom Trade had sold more than 300,000 copies. Steven P. Schacht notes that this fact \\"makes it one of the best selling books ever written by a sociologist.\\" The book was also published by Gerald Duckworth & Co. in British English, and in German by Ferinand Emke Vertag. Both of these versions were published in 1974.  Humphreys' influence  Humphreys influenced generations of sociologists and other social and behavioral scientists in complex ways. He is often studied in research methods classes for the ethical questions that his works raised. However, Earl Babbie, who writes about sociological research methods, notes that the controversy about \\"sociological snoopers\\"von Hoffman, Nicholas; Irving Louis Horowitz; and Lee Rainwater. (1973). \\"Sociological snoopers and journalistic moralizers: An exchange.\\" Values of Social Science 1/1/1973: 145-164. and research ethics was likely the result of societal homophobia and disgust with the research topic, and not due to real problems with research methods.Babbie, Earl. (2004). \\"Laud Humphreys and research ethics.\\" International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy. 24(3-5): 12-19. Schacht credits Humphreys with pioneering research on impersonal sex, now a common topic of research and advocacy in the context of HIV/AIDS. Tewksbury writes about the multiple studies that were inspired by Humphrey's work, calling his work a rich legacy for future sex researchers.Tewksbury, Richard. (2004). \\"The intellectual legacy of Laud Humphreys: His impact on research and thinking about men's public sexual encounters.\\" The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy 24(3-5): 32-57. According to Brekhus, Humphrey's contribution to sociological theory, in particular to the development of the concept of identity politics, is often overlooked, but should be hailed as an important forerunner to modern queer theory.Brekhus, Wayne N. (2004). \\"Commuting to homosexuality: Laud Humphreys' unheralded theoretical contribution to the sociology of identity.\\" The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy 24(3-5): 58-72. Nardi also lauds Humphreys' theoretical work, especially his concept of the breastplate of righteousness. Humphreys developed this idea to explain the apparent contradiction of presumably straight, married men holding a public conservative stance against homosexuality, yet engaging in impersonal sex with men in public settings.Nardi, Peter M. (1995). \\"The breastplate of righteousness: Twenty-five years after Laud Humphrey's Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places.\\" Journal of Homosexuality 30(1-10). In 2003, the presidential session at the Society for the Study of Social Problems (SSSP) was devoted to honoring Humphrey's pioneering work on sexuality. In 2004, a special issue of The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy was published that was edited by Steven P. Schacht, who participated in the SSSP session. The special issue contained ten articles analyzing his research and his multiple contributions as a social activist and scholar. The authors of these articles call for sociologists and others to move beyond criticism of Humphrey's research methodologies in the tearoom study, and instead to focus on his pioneering contributions to the study of sexuality, participant-observation as method, development of sociological theory, and his work as a social activist and advocate for marginalized sexual identities. Schacht states that an estimated 300,000 copies of Tearoom had been sold by 2004, which makes it one of the best selling books ever written by a sociologist.

He served as a politician representing the Liberal Party. He was Prime Minister of Norway from 1902 to 1903 during the Union between Sweden and Norway and from 1921 to 1923 following the Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden.Otto Blehr (Government Administration Services) Biography Blehr grew up at a farm at Stange in Hedmark, Norway. His parents were Albert Blehr (1805–1872) and Maren Wilhelmine Ludovica Kathinka Stenersen (1818–1877). His father was a doctor and physicist at Sanderud Hospital. He graduated in 1865 and then began studying the University of Christiania. Blehr graduated cand.jur. in 1871. He served as parliamentary reporter for the newspapers Dagbladet and Bergens Tidende. In 1874, he was one of the founders of the Fjordabladet where he served as the first editor-in- chief until 1882. In 1878, he also started and served as the first editor of the Sogns Tidende. Blehr was the governor of Nordre Bergenhus (1883–1888) and for Nordland (1895–1900). In 1877, he established himself as a prosecutor at Lærdal in Sogn. In 1879 Blehr was elected as first deputy representative to the Storting for Nordre Bergenhus amt (now Sogn og Fjordane) and from 1883 to 1888 he was a permanent representative. In the fall of 1888 he was not re- elected to the Storting. He became a prosecutor (fogd) in Sunnfjord and Nordfjord. In 1889 a lawyer in Hålogaland. He held this assignment until he became a judge (lagmann) at Kristiania in 1893. In 1894 Blehr was again elected to the Storting, now for Nordland. Blehr was re-elected as parliamentary deputy for Nordland in 1898. On 21 April 1902, he took over as Prime Minister of the Norwegian government in Kristiania. In October 1903, Blehr resigned as a result of an election defeat. In 1905 he was appointed as County Governor (stiftsamtmann) at Christiania (now Oslo), an office he held until 1921. On 21 June 1921, Otto Blehr became Prime Minister and at the same time also chief of the Ministry of Finance. He was also a member of the Norwegian delegation to the League of Nations 1920 and 1922–1925. On 3 March 1923 the government resigned.

He was a pro- business, low-tax, isolationist conservative Republican who exemplified the traditional values of his party and fought vigorously against the New Deal, especially regarding taxes.  U.S. Congressman  Elected in 1915 to the House of Representatives from upstate New York's Thirty-first district, Snell, a Republican, served in Congress until he retired in 1939. He was intensely loyal to the regular Republican leaders, only deviating from this fidelity when constituent interests were at stake. Early in his congressional service he offered a bill to make the St. Lawrence River more navigable, which he pursued unsuccessfully for the rest of his days in Congress. When the Saint Lawrence Seaway finally came to fruition during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, one of its locks was named after Snell. According to his biographer, Louis A. Barone, Snell, throughout his congressional career, generally opposed federal regulatory interference in the private sector and big spending programs.  House Committee Chairman  In 1923 Snell became chairman of the important House Rules Committee. This position gave him great power in Congress and the Republican party, because he was in a position to frame legislation and legislative strategy. When Nicholas Longworth ascended to the Speakership and John Q. Tilson became majority floor leader in 1925, they, along with Snell, effectively controlled in concert the House of Representatives. Snell's first job as chairman of the Rules Committee was to fend off a challenge by insurgent Republicans and Democrats to ease restrictions on discharge petitions. Snell helped fashion a compromise that allowed regular Republican leaders a modicum of control. When Longworth became Speaker in 1925, the Old Guard reestablished its dominance in the lower chamber. In this, the regular Republicans were aided by Snell's Rules Committee in restricting Democrats and insurgent Republicans from interfering with President Calvin Coolidge's program of spending cuts and tax reduction. To Democrats' complaints that Snell was too restrictive with the rules, the New Yorker responded that the opposition would undoubtedly do the same if and when they came back to power in the House—which they did. During these years Snell also played a role as a go-between for Congress and his college friend from Amherst, President Coolidge. This was not always a popular job, especially when differences arose between the president and Congress. Snell backed Herbert Hoover for the 1928 GOP presidential nomination, albeit somewhat unenthusiastically. He would have preferred for President Calvin Coolidge to run for another term. Snell's relations with the engineer president soured slightly when Hoover tried unsuccessfully to seize the initiative in New York patronage. Snell's dream of eventually becoming Speaker was dashed with the onset of the Great Depression. In the wake of the 1930 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of the House. After Longworth died in April 1931, Tilson and Snell tussled for the job of minority leader. Despite being favored by the president, Tilson lost the race to Snell, who appealed to both the Old Guard and to the insurgents. Tilson was too closely associated with the increasingly unpopular Hoover, and Snell had made some concessions to the progressive Republicans.  Later career  With Hoover's defeat and the advent of the New Deal, Snell spent the rest of his days in Congress fighting the liberal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt. His initial reaction to the New Deal was one of cautious but critical cooperation. Snell, in the midst of the economic crisis, supported some early measures of the New Deal, such as the 1933 Emergency Banking Act and the 1933 Economy Act, but he came out in cautious, conservative opposition to most of the president's program. He opposed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Elmer Thomas amendment favoring inflation, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, and other early New Deal measures. During the Court-packing battle of 1937, Snell agreed with Senate GOP leaders to allow the now mammoth Democratic majority to fight amongst themselves, which they did, sinking the plan. The so-called Roosevelt recession of 1937 also encouraged Snell and other conservatives to step up their resistance to the New Deal. In late 1937 Snell introduced legislation for a tax cut. During the special session of Congress in the same year, Republicans and southern Democrats combined to recommit Roosevelt's Fair Labor Standards Bill, although it was enacted in the next session. In 1938 Snell and the GOP minority successfully opposed Roosevelt's original executive branch reorganization plan. The midterm elections that year were a triumph for the GOP, narrowing the partisan gap in Congress. However, because of declining eyesight and hearing and his belief that the Republicans would not retake the House in the near future, Snell decided to retire. After his retirement in 1939, he became publisher of the Potsdam Courier-Freeman, which he had bought five years earlier, and in 1941 became owner and manager of the New York State Oil Company, of Kansas. After his death in Potsdam, New York, in 1958, he was interred in Bayside Cemetery. Bertrand H. Snell Hall at Clarkson University is named in his honor.

The commission's mandate was to establish findings and develop recommendations for a new and comprehensive national ocean policy. The final report was delivered in September 2004, and shortly afterwards the commission was terminated, as scheduled by the Oceans Act.  Working groups  Members of the Watkins Commission In the course of its work, the Commission established four working groups to address the following issues: * Governance * Research, Education and Marine Operations * Stewardship * Investment and Implementation  History  The previous review of U.S. ocean policy had been conducted thirty-five years before by the Stratton Commission, published in 1969. To account for changes in the intervening years, the U.S. Congress decided to form the Commission on Ocean Policy to conduct a new review, and develop recommendations for future ocean policy. The Oceans Act of 2000 was passed in the Senate June 6, 2000, and become effective on January 20, 2001. The Commission is composed of 16 members. Per the Act, the House of Representatives and Senate Majority each nominated eight people, and the President appointed four from each list. The Commission began its work in September 2001 with a series of nine regional meetings and 18 additional site visits in every coastal region of the United States and the Great Lakes. The Commission heard testimony from 445 experts, including many of the nation's top ocean scientists and researchers, environmental organizations, industry, citizens, and government officials, as well as receiving written testimony from countless others. The Commission released its Preliminary Report on April 20, 2004, for review by the nation's Governors and other stakeholders.

He had a brief teaching career, in Dagenham. Coming to London in 1934, he rapidly made initial contacts in the literary world. A short study Middleton Murry: A Study in Excellent Normality (1934) brought him for a time into John Middleton Murry's Adelphi commune at \\"The Oaks\\", where in 1935 he worked as a cook.J. P. Carswell (1978), Lives and Letters: A. R. Orage, Katherine Mansfield, Beatrice Hastings, John Middleton Murry, S. S. Koteliansky, 1906–1957, pp. 247–249. Also in 1935 he met Dylan Thomas, sent to meet him by Sir Richard Rees of the Adelphi magazine.Andrew Lycett, Dylan Thomas: A New Life (2003), p. 130. In short order he became a Catholic convert, and married Margaret Edwards in 1937 (with whom he later had two children: Adam Heppenstall and Lindy Heppenstall, née Foord).Lycett, pp. 146, 175. In the mid-1930s he was influenced by Eric Gill.Fiona MacCarthy, Eric Gill (1989), pp. 162, 269. He was a friend of George Orwell, whom he first encountered in 1935 through Thomas and Rees,Gordon Bowker, George Orwell (2003), p. 164. and later wrote about him in his memoir Four Absentees. Heppenstall, Orwell and the Irish poet Michael Sayers shared a flat in Lawford Road, Camden. Heppenstall once came home drunk and noisy, and when Orwell emerged from his bedroom and asked him to pipe down, Heppenstall took a swing at him. Orwell then beat him up with a shooting-stick, and the following morning told him to move out. Friendship was restored, but after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote an account of the incident called The Shooting- Stick.Bernard Crick: George Orwell: A Life, 1982 During World War II he was in the British Army, but with a Pay Corps posting at Reading, close enough to remain in touch with literary Fitzrovia.Robert Hewison, Under Siege: Literary Life in London 1939–45 (1977), p. 62. He was also posted to Northern Ireland.Clair Wills, That Neutral Island (2007), pp. 158–9. In an interview for the book World Authors, Heppenstall stated he had once been a left-winger, but since the 1960s had become politically more conservative. Heppenstall also said he was especially opposed to \\"Progressivism\\" and World Government. He listed Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, and Vladimir Nabokov as the writers he most admired. Novelist Heppenstall's first novel, The Blaze of Noon (1939), was critically acclaimed.Francis King, \\"The loneliness of a long- distance hater\\" (Reviews of The Master Eccentric and The Pier by Rayner Heppenstall). The Spectator, 6 December 1986, (pp. 44–5). Much later, in 1967, it received an Arts Council award.Buckell, p. 38. He was Francophile in literary terms, and his non-fiction writing reflects his tastes. Critical attention has linked him to the French nouveau roman, in fact as an anticipator, or as a writer of the \\"anti-novel\\". Several critics (including, according to his diaries, Hélène Cixous) have named Heppenstall in this connection. He is sometimes therefore grouped with Alain Robbe-Grillet, or associated with other British experimentalists: Anthony Burgess, Alan Burns, Angela Carter, B. S. Johnson, Ann Quin, Stefan Themerson and Eva Figes. The Connecting Door (1962) is singled out as being influenced by the nouveau roman.Randall Stevenson, The Last of England?, Oxford English Literary History, vol. 12, p. 408. He was certainly influenced by Raymond Roussel, whose Impressions of Africa he translated. Later novels include The Shearers, Two Moons and The Pier. He also wrote a short study of the French Catholic writer Léon Bloy (Cambridge: Bowes & Bowes, 1953). Heppenstall's book The Fourfold Tradition was praised by V. S. Pritchett, who expressed admiration for \\"its pleasure in literature\\". Radio work From 1945 to 1965, he worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation on radio as a feature writer and producer, and then for two further years as a drama producer. His contemporaries in the department included the fellow poets Louis MacNeice, W R Rodgers and Terence Tiller.E.S. Guralnick.

In his journals, Heppenstall mentions problems he had with Evelyn Waugh regarding a radio broadcast in the 1940s. Waugh apparently felt that Heppenstall purposely insulted him when he was sent to take him to the broadcast. Later life Later in life Heppenstall moved to the town of Deal. During this time he took a strong dislike to his working-class neighbours and began deliberately lighting bonfires in order to antagonise them.\\"Having moved to Deal, Heppenstall was soon on equally dire terms with his neighbours there, deliberately lighting bonfires in order to annoy them.\\" King 6 December 1986.John Carey, The intellectuals and the masses : pride and prejudice among the literary intelligentsia, 1880–1939.

After his death, Heppenstall's journals were published: they caused some controversy by revealing his hostility to fellow writers such as Alan Sillitoe, and also expressing prejudices against black people, Irish people, Arabs and lesbians.

He was Prime Minister of Norway from 1895 to 1898 and from 1903 to 1905. As a legal scholar, he is known for his contributions to the development of public international law, and was chairman of the Institut de Droit International. Biography Francis Hagerup grew up at Horten in Vestfold, Norway. He was a son of admiral and cabinet minister Henrik Steffens Hagerup (1806–1859) and Nicoline Christine Jenssen (1808–1862). He graduated with the cand.jur. degree at the Royal Frederick University in 1876, received a grant to study abroad, and became a research fellow at the Royal Frederick University in 1879. He obtained the dr.juris degree in 1885, and was professor of law at the Royal Frederick University from 1887 to 1906. He was minister of justice in the Second cabinet Stang from 2 May 1893 to 14 October 1895. In August 1895 he was Finance minister. He was a member of the Storting from 1901 to 1906. He served as Prime Minister of Norway for two terms. First from October 14, 1895; secondly from October 22, 1903. In social policy, Hagerup's time as Prime Minister saw the passage of a child care law in 1896 that increased the power of local authorities and courts over neglected and abused children. Following his two bouts as Prime Minister, he served as ambassador to Copenhagen, The Hague, and Brussels. From 1916 he was ambassador in Stockholm.Foundations of the Welfare State, 2nd Edition by Pat Thane, published 1996 Hagerup was passionately involved in the development of public international law. From 1897 he was member of the Institut de Droit International, of which he became the chairman in 1912. In 1907 he headed the Norwegian delegation at the second peace conference in The Hague. He was also delegate at international conferences regarding admiralty law. In 1920 he led the Norwegian delegation when the League of Nations convened for the first time in Geneva. The same year he was elected to the Law committee under the League council. In 1888, he founded Tidsskrift for Retsvidenskab (Journal of Jurisprudence), and served as its editor until his death. Hagerup was also member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1 January 1907 until his death in 1921.

It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with a Sulzer 16LVA24 engine rated at providing a maximum speed of and weighed 133 tonnes. It was painted in a livery of yellow ochre with a broad chocolate-brown band around the lower bodyside separated by a thin white line running around the body. Background and design In the mid 1960s British rail produced specifications for type 5 locomotives weighing less than 126t with more than of power for both passenger and freight working.THE RAILWAY RAPTORS section HS4000 KESTREL glostransporthistory.visit-gloucestershire.co.uk Brush Electric Engineering Ltd. (Brush Traction) in association with Sulzer Brothers Ltd. responded with a locomotive for British Rail's appraisal. The body, exterior details, control console, and colours were designed by E.G. M. Wilkes of \\"Wilkes & Ward\\"As per hand written annotation on the rear of a photograph of the HS4000 which was written by E.G.M. Wilkes himself. Photo among Wilkes' own archive of photos sold at auction on 14/02/2019: https://www.henryadamsfineart.co.uk/lot/47685 (later Wilkes & Ashmore, industrial design firm based on Horsham, West Sussex). The design principle was that a single engine would require less maintenance than twin-engined vehicles, and that the very high power would mean that double heading for freight trains would be unnecessary. =Diesel engine= Brush employed Sulzer's 16-cylinder Vee 16LVA24 engine made in Winterthur. Previous experience with Sulzer's 12-cylinder twin parallel-bank dual-crank 12LDA28 engine had gone well, but the highest power available from Sulzer in this form was the 12LDA31 of see The Sulzer engine in diesel traction : A potted and incomplete history. Not only did the V engines provide over , but being single-crank with the consequently lighter engine block (over the dual-bank design) gave a better power-to-weight ratio.The Sulzer engine in diesel traction : A potted and incomplete history 1912 - 1990 www.derbysulzers.com The engine is a four-stroke turbocharged oil-cooled design, with the oil being cooled by water in a heat exchanger, and the water cooled in radiators. The piston diameter is 240 mm with a stroke 280 mm. A smaller auxiliary generator (~40 kW) was used to charge the batteries or start the engine etc. =Electrical transmission and auxiliary electrical system= To transmit this power to the rail Brush utilised a brushless salient poleSalient-Pole Machines General description of salient pole machines as both motors and generators mysite.du.edu three phase alternator connected to a rectifying circuit of 84 silicon diodes producing ~2,500 kW of power for electric traction from the diesel engine. An auxiliary alternator, also brushless and producing three phase electrical power gave ~500 kW for electrical train heating, and also supplied power to electrical fans etc. in the locomotive. The rotors for both alternators were electrically energisedi.e. not permanent magnet type by DC produced by the rectified output of brushless alternators.Thus the excitor alternators, and the main alternators's rotor were coaxial and connected, with the rectifying diodes also undergoing rotary motion Each of the 6 axles were powered by its individual traction motor which were four pole force ventilated types. Connection of the axle to the motor was via a reduction gear (giving top speed), then through a flexible hollow shaft drive to the axle. The fans (blowers) to cool the traction motors and engine radiators were of the three phase asynchronous type, the motors driving the compressors, pumps, fans for the dynamic (resistive) brake etc. were DC motors. =Braking system= Locomotive braking was by vacuum, air (high pressure) or dynamic (electrical regenerative resistive braking), the dynamic brakes were preferentially used at high speeds, with the air brake being activated at lower speeds where dynamic braking was less effective; speed sensors automatically determined the braking type to be used. Additionally a hydraulically activated parking brake was fitted. =Electronic devices= Plug-in solid state modules were used for voltage and power control including monitoring wheelslip and monitoring engine temperature. =Superstructure construction= A Warren truss body construction with welded, stressed steel skin was used on the sides of the locomotive which supported the transverse load of the main engine entirely. =Bogies= The bogie side frames were of one piece cast construction with coil spring suspension, connected by 4 transverse members; two internal and two at either end After the Hither Green rail crash, British Rail issued a directive that all locomotives should have an axle weight of no-more than 21 tons. In an attempt to comply with this, Brush fitted the locomotive with modified British Rail Class 47 bogies. The lighter construction and traction motors helped but the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful leaving Kestrel at 22.5 tons per axle. Kestrel continued to be used but the axle-weight problem contributed to the decision to sell the locomotive and prior to this, in March 1971, the original bogies were refitted. =Cabs= The driver's cab is attached to the frame below by rubber fittings. Driver controls were similar to that of Class 47. Career =British Rail= Construction of the locomotive (Brush works No. 711 of 1967) started in 1966 and was complete by 1967. However the locomotive was considerably over the 20t axle-load limit specified by British Rail for its procurement requirements. The locomotive was officially handed over to BR on 29 January 1968 at Marylebone Station. Test runs were performed with both passenger and freight stock; the locomotive was primarily used to haul heavy freight trains - including a coal train of over 2000t weight - the locomotive achieved an 88% availability figure after . Following the fitting of its new bogies the locomotive was used on express passenger trains. On a London King's Cross to Newcastle service diagrammed for British Rail Class 55 ('Deltic') operation the unit was 14mins faster than required even though the new traction motors meant reduced power at the rail.A Sulzer Engineer's Memories 1965-1979 On British Railways & Elsewhere section HS4000 \\"Kestrel\\" www.derbysulzers.com In March 1971 it was withdrawn from service in the UK and sent back to Brush for refitting. =Sale to Soviet Union= The locomotive was sold to the Soviet Union in 1971 for £127,000, being shipped from Cardiff Docks to Leningrad docks by the MV Krasnokamsk in July 1971. On arrival in Russia, Kestrel was exhibited at the Moscow Rolling Stock Exhibition and then was moved to the All-Union Rail Transport Scientific Research Institute at Shcherbinka where it was re-gauged to , and tested on a circular test railwaySee :ru:Экспериментальная кольцевая железная дорога ВНИИЖТ : Experimental test railway VNIIZhT in the Yuzhnoye Butovo District.

After testing of the locomotive the engine was removed for static testing, and the locomotive body ballasted for use in high load tests of other vehicles. The remains of the vehicle are believed to have been scrapped in 1993. Conclusions =United Kingdom= The locomotive did not result in any further orders.The Railway magazine. August 2008, via www.zinio.com =Russia= Some of the observations of Russian railway engineers relate to different practices between Russian and British locomotive design, specifically: * Due to the smaller loading gauges in Great Britain, the cab windows were set too low for signals to be seen if the driver is standing. * The passages were too narrow. * The bogies were considered overly large. * The requirement to sling the engine and compressor below the main frame considered unusual. * The stressed skin construction was noted as being not suitable due to corrosion increasing the susceptibility to structural weakening, as the load-bearing skin is thin and point welded.Тепловоз HS400 (Кестрелл) Diesel HS4000 Kestrel ivan1950.tripod.com Author: Oleg Izmerov, Bryansk The axle bearings, traction transmissionИзмеров О.В. : ЛАССИФИКАЦИИ ТЯГОВЫХ ПРИВОДОВ ПО ДИНАМИЧЕСКИМ СВОЙСТВАМ ДЛЯ ЗАДАЧ ПРОЕКТИРОВАНИЯ РЕЛЬСОВЫХ ЭКИПАЖЕЙ Classification of vehicle traction drives by dynamic properties, Author:O V Izmerov, it is noted that the axial drive found in the 'Kestrel' locomotive gives lower horizontal and vertical track forces than an axle hung motor on a TEP75 locomotive at 160 km/h. www.zimerov.narod.ru and spherical rubber metal joints in the suspensionТЯГОВЫЕ ПРИВОДЫ ПЕРИОДА МАССОВОЙ РЕКОНСТРУКЦИИ ТЯГИ Traction drive suspension systems www.zimerov.narod.ru were considered of interest. =Developments= Some of the HS4000's technology was used to form the basis of, or improvements in, subsequent locomotives built in the Soviet Union.

Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, and each is published by various companies such as Nexon. In the game, players travel the \\"Maple World\\", defeating monsters and developing their characters' skills and abilities as is typical in role-playing games. Players can interact with others in many ways, including chatting and trading. Groups of players can band together in parties to hunt monsters and share rewards, and can also form guilds to interact more easily with each other. Players additionally have the option to visit the in-game \\"Cash Shop\\" to purchase a variety of character appearances or gameplay enhancements with real money. In July 2010, the Korean version of the game was completely revised in a patch named the \\"Big Bang\\". Other versions followed suit and have since received the Big Bang update. Later in the year, the Korean version received the Chaos update which introduced PvP (player-versus-player) and professions to the game. Its sequel, MapleStory 2, was released in July 2015 and features updated 3D graphics and a similar storyline. , the game has reached over registered users worldwide and grossed over in lifetime revenue. Plot Players assume the roles of citizens in the Maple World with no specific objective to win the game, but to work on improving their characters' skill and status over time. The antagonist of the game, the Black Mage, was sealed away years ago by six heroes. Fearing his resurrection, Empress Cygnus enlisted the Maple World to join her Cygnus Knights in preventing his return. However, the Black Wings were able to return the Black Mage to reality for a moment, causing a cataclysm known as the Big Bang. With the seal on the Black Mage weakening, the five heroes return to the world in a weakened state. The player's character begins a quest to restore the Black Mage's seal but instead, witnesses his revival. The Black Mage then begins assimilating Grandis with the Maple World in order to rule both worlds. Gameplay MapleStory is a 2D scrolling platform game. The controls for the game are executed using the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is used for many game functions, and much of it can be rearranged to suit users' needs. The mouse is mainly used to trigger NPCs and manipulate items. Like most MMORPGs, gameplay centers on venturing into dungeons and combating monsters in real- time. The players combat monsters and complete quests, in the process acquiring in-game currency called \\"Mesos\\", experience points and various items. Players are able to acquire in-game professions, allowing them to craft equipment, accessories or potions. Players have a variety of options when interacting with others online: They can form parties where loot and experience are distributed from a monster; in-game marriages where the game will recognize the two players as a heterosexual couple; guilds which is indicated with a guild's name listed under their character name; or families, an architecture gathering of juniors and seniors. Players are also able to raise or lower the in-game popularity stat entitled Fame of other players and compete with other players in minigames, such as Gomoku or Concentration. They may also engage in trading activities for \\"Mesos\\" or other in-game items (though subject to virtual tax). =Characters= MapleStory characters exist in worlds or servers. Players are able to create multiple characters in each world, though the characters in different worlds can not interact with each other. Each world is similar in content with each other. The worlds are divided into channels, among which characters are allowed to freely switch. The ability to transfer entire characters between worlds was added in December 2007 to Global MapleStory, with restrictions placed on items. In May 2012, this option was removed as it caused a negative impact on character gameplay. When creating a new character, there are six branches of classes currently available, with two other branches with one class each: Explorers, Cygnus Knights, Heroes, Resistance, Nova and Sengoku. Beast Tamer and Child of God have one class in both branches. Some classes are currently not available in other regions. Explorer characters start on Maple Island and begin as a Beginner class. The Beginner is able to advance into one of the five classes: Warrior, Bowmen, Magician, Thief and Pirate. } } } After choosing their class, further class progression is only allowed within the scope of the first class advancement with advancements at level 30, 60, 100, and 200. Three separate classes, under the adventurer branch, are created differently from normal Adventurers: Dual Blade (Thief), Kinesis (Magician) and Cannoneers (Pirate).} Cygnus Knight characters begin as Noblesse class and begin their journey on Ereve. At level 10, they are allowed to class advance into five Cygnus Knight classes, each one parallels to the Explorer class. Upon reaching the level limit of 120, Cygnus Knights are able to change into a level 50 explorer with benefits. Six Hero classes are currently available: Aran, Evan, Mercedes, Phantom, Luminous and Shade. The Hero classes are characters with background stories related to the antagonist of the game, the Black Mage. Aran has the Combo System, a unique feature to the class, allowing them to generate combo counts by hitting monsters, giving them buffs and allowing them to cast combo- consuming skills. Evan is similar to Magicians, but uses a dragon, which fights alongside them. Mercedes is an elven archer who uses Dual Bowguns. Phantom is a Thief character with the ability to mimic skills from Adventurer characters. Luminous is a magician of light who can also use dark magic which they absorbed from the Black Mage. Shade is the sixth and forgotten hero, whose existence was erased during the sealing of the Black Mage. They use spirits to aid them in battle. Resistance characters begin in Edelstein, a town taken over by the Black Mage's followers; the Black Wings.} } The characters created under the Resistance branch begin as Citizens and have four available job advancements: Battle Mage, Wild Hunter, Blaster and Mechanic. A Battle Mage uses a staff for physical attacks, a Wild Hunter rides a jaguar while wielding a crossbow, a Blaster uses an arm cannon and a Mechanic uses a robotic suit to fight. Demon, a separate class, under the resistance branch, is created differently from the normal Resistance. A Demon character can become a Demon Slayer, who uses one-handed blunt weapons and axes, or the Demon Avenger, who uses a specialised weapon called the Desperado. Xenon, another separate resistance character, is a human-turned- cyborg who escaped from the Black Wings' laboratories who uses Whip Blades in combat. =World= There are three main continents common to all versions in the MapleStory world: Maple Island, Victoria Island and Ossyria. Maple Island is where adventurers start off their characters. Victoria Island contains eight cities, and is where most classes begin. Ossyria features seven distinct regions with varying environments: El Nath Mountains, Ludus Lake, Aqua Road, Minar Forest, Mu Lung Garden, Nihal Desert and Temple of Time. Ereve and Rien are separated from another land which is the beginning of another job of the game. =Cash Shop= The Cash Shop is an in-game shop where players use real- life currency to purchase unique virtual goods such as avatars, digital pets and other in-game items.

Hanley came from a seafaring family and spent two years at sea himself, during World War I. He published his first novel Drift in 1930. In the 1930s and 1940s his novels and short stories focussed on seamen and their families, and included Boy (1931), the subject of an obscenity trial. After World War II there was less emphasis on the sea in his works. While frequently praised by critics, Hanley's novels did not sell well. In the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s he wrote plays, mainly for the BBC, for radio and then for television, and also for the theatre. He returned to the novel in the 1970s. His last novel, A Kingdom, was published in 1978, when he was eighty. His brother Gerald was also a novelist. Biography Born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, Lancashire, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working class family. Both his parents were, on the other hand, born in Ireland, his father Edward Hanley around 1865, in Dublin, and his mother, Bridget Roache, in Queenstown, County Cork, around 1867. However, both were \\"well established in Liverpool by 1891\\", when they were married. Hanley's father worked most of his life as a stoker, particularly on Cunard liners, and other relatives had also gone to sea.Chris Gostick, \\"Extra Material on James Hanley's Boy\\", in the OneWorld Classics edition of Boy (2007), pp.182–3. James also grew up living close to the docks. He left school in the summer of 1910 and worked for four years in an accountants' office. Then early in 1915, aged 17 he went to sea for the first time (not 13 as he again implied).An important biographical source is Chris Gostick's \\"Extra Material on James Hanley's Boy\\", pp. 181–4. Thus life at sea was a formative influence and much of his early writing is about seamen.John Fordham, James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2002), p. 23. Then, in April 1917, Hanley jumped ship in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and shortly thereafter joined the Canadian Army in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Hanley fought in France in the summer of 1918, but was invalided out shortly thereafter. After the war he worked as a railway porter in Bootle and he devoted himself \\"to a prodiguous range of autodidactic, high cultural activities – learning the piano, regularly attending […] concerts […] reading voraciously and, above all, writing.\\"John Fordham, p. 94. However, it was not until 1930 that his novel Drift was accepted.Gostick, pp. 185–6. Hanley moved from Liverpool to near Corwen, North Wales in 1931, where he met Dorothy Enid \\"Timothy\\" Thomas, née Heathcote, a descendant of Lincolnshire nobility. They lived together and had a child, Liam Powys Hanley, in 1933, but did not marry until 1947.Gostick, pp.187–8.Fordham, pp. 139, 266 fn18. As World War II was approaching, in July 1939, Hanley moved to London, to write documentaries and plays for the BBC,Fordham, pp.161–62. but he moved back to Wales, to Llanfechain, the other side of the Berwyn Mountains from Corwen, in the early years of the war, where he remained until 1963, when the Hanleys moved to North London, close to their son Liam.Gostick, pp.189–90,192, and Fordham, pp. 225–26 Hanley published an autobiographical work, Broken Water: An Autobiographical Excursion in 1937, and while this generally presents a true overall picture of his life, it is seriously flawed, incomplete and inaccurate. Chris Gostick describes it as \\"a teasing palimpsest of truth and imagination\\".Gostick, p. 181. Fordham and Gostick are the most reliable biographical sources. Hanley's brother was the novelist Gerald Hanley and his nephew the American novelist and playwright William Hanley. James Hanley's wife also published three novels, as Timothy Hanley. She died in 1980. James Hanley himself died in 1985. He was buried in Llanfechain, Wales.Gostick, p. 193. St. Garmon's Church Llanfechain. The Hanleys lived in Llanfechain from December 1940 until 1963, and Hanley was buried there. Works =1930s and 1940s= Hanley's first publication, the novel Drift (1930), was written under the influence of James Joyce.As a quotation blurb on the cover of the cheap edition of 1932 underlines: \\"The portraits of Joe Rourke and his mother are, indeed, two of the most profound expressions of the Catholic soul I have yet seen; truer and finer, in my opinion, than anything in Joyce’s A Portrait of an Artist or the vicious caricatures of Liam O’Flaherty\\". London: Joiner and Steele, 1932. A quotation from The Referee. While Drift is about an Irish Catholic family, the setting is Liverpool, and in the 1930s Hanley wrote largely about the Irish community in Liverpool, especially with the semi- autobiographical novels about the Fury family, The Furys (1935), The Secret Journey (1936), and Our Time is Gone (1940), as well as Ebb and Flood (1932). Hanley's novels of the 1930s and 1940s also focus on life at sea. Hanley wrote two further novels about the Furys of Liverpool, Winter Song (1950), and An End and a Beginning (1958), though Irish and especially Roman Catholic characters continue to have a significant role throughout most of Hanley’s career.See Fordham, pp.185, 187, 188, 201. James Hanley consistently explored the lives of men and women in extremes, that is in dramatically precarious states of fear and isolation, which tend to lead to violence and madness.Kristin Anderson, \\"A Queer Sort\\", review of One Worlds Classics' edition (2007) of Boy. Dublin Review of Books: A grim early example is in the novella The Last Voyage (1931). John Reilly is a fireman who is still working only because he has lied about his age, and now faces his last voyage.Edward Stokes, The Novels of James Hanley (1964), p. 90. Reilly although he is in his mid-sixties has a young family, and therefore the family will have to live on his inadequate pension.Stokes, p. 16. In another sense this is Reilly's last voyage, because despairing as to the future he throws himself into the ship’s furnace: \\"Saw all his life illuminated in those flames. 'Not much for us. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Sign on. Sweat, sweat. Pay off. Finish. Ah, well!’\\".Paul Binding, \\"Man Against Fate\\", a review of James Hanley's Last Voyage and Other Stories. Times Literary Supplement, 5 December 1997, p. 21.Last Voyage and Other Stories (London: Harvill Press, 1997, p. 43. In Boy (1931) young Fearon’s isolation and suffering arise because no one cares for him. The story of Boy is \\"sordid and horrible\\".Stokes, p. 28. The young protagonist’s parents are only interested in the wages he can earn, and encourage him to leave school as soon as possible.Stokes, p. 28. Likewise society is unconcerned about the harsh, unhealthy conditions he endures cleaning ships' boilers. Then, when he goes to sea, he is sexually abused by his fellow seamen. Finally, when young Fearon is dying in agony from a venereal disease caught in a Cairo brothel, his Captain smothers him.Stokes, pp. 28–32. Boy was reprinted in 1931, and 1932, when an American first edition was also published. Then, when it was reprinted in 1934, in a cheap (second) edition with a \\"scantily dressed\\" belly dancer on its cover, Boy was prosecuted for obscenity. The court case followed a complaint to the police in Bury, near Manchester, Lancashire: \\"The prosecution suggested that the cover of the book and extracts from reviews just inside were most suggestive, and that the purpose was to pollute young people's minds\\".Gibbs, pp. 25–6. The publishers Boriswood \\"were advised that, owing to the book's reference to 'intimacy between members of the male sex', any defence against prosecution was futile'\\".Fordham, p. 140. In March 1935 Boriswood pleaded guilty of \\"uttering and publishing an obscene libel\\" and paid a substantial fine.Fordham, p. 146. Subsequently Boy was republished by the Obelisk Press in Paris in 1935 and 1946.Gibbs, pp. 26–7. Re the 1936 edition, see Fordham, p. 146 and fn 57, p. 270. Jack Kahane owner of this company was a noted publisher of banned books in English, including Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer and Lady Chatterley's Lover.Forham, p. 270, fn 57. Other editions followed, including one by Penguin Books in 1992, with an introduction by Anthony Burgess and most recently, in 2007, by Oneworld Classics. It is not surprising that Hanley should show an interest in extreme situations, given his early awareness of the precariousness of life in the working class world that he came from.Fordham, pp.39–40. Hanley would also have sensed, very early in his life, that individual lives of the working poor and their children was of little value in a modern industrial city like Liverpool.Paul Binding, \\"Man Against Fate\\", p.21. All this encouraged his exploration not only of working class life but also the emotional life of characters on the periphery of society.See for example Fordham's discussion of The Closed Harbour and Levine, pp. 185–193. There is an exploration of another type of extreme situation in those works of Hanley which deal with a shipwreck, such as \\"Narrative\\" (1931), and the World War II novels The Ocean (1941), Sailor’s Song (1943), though these extreme situations are undergone by groups of men, and \\"were primarily inspiriting in their representation of maritime heroism\\".Fordham, p. 165. =After World War II= James Hanley's London home. In the 1950s he wrote some of \\"his finest novels\\", Closed Harbour (1952), The Welsh Sonata (1954), Levine (1956), and An End and a Beginning (1958), the final volume of the Furys sequence.Gostick, pp.190–91 Characters in extreme situations is also the subject these novels of Hanley's maturity, where the male protagonists, following some trauma, are both unemployed and isolated from family and society.Stokes, pp.158–165, 165–174, 79–85. Hanley’s protagonists tend to be solitary figures and his concern is with loneliness, rootlessness, violence and madness and \\"he was never a political novelist or propagandist\\".Stokes, p. 201. He described himself as an anarchist, in a statement sent to International Pen. \\"I have been labelled a 'Proletarian writer' [… which] is to be party to more than one quite absurd theory, one of which is that only one section society is evil, and only one section capable of soaring; this message comes out of Communist vacuums […] My whole attitude is anarchial (sic), I do not believe in the State at all \\".Originally from P.E.N. online archives. In the 1960s, because of his lack of financial success as a novelist, Hanley turned to writing plays for radio, television, and occasionally the theatre.Gostick, pp.190–92. While he wrote mostly for the BBC, his plays were also produced in several other countries, including the CBC in Canada.Linnea Gibbs, James Hanley: A Bibliography, pp.168–70. Hanley's play Say Nothing was on stage for a month at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East in 1962 and off Broadway, New York, in 1965, while Inner Journey was on stage in Hamburg in 1966, as well as New York's Lincoln Center for a month in 1969.Gibbs, p. 175 Hanley returned to the novel form in the 1970s, publishing Another World, A Woman in the Sky (1973), A Dream Journey (1976) and The Kingdom (1978), all of which \\"were positively received\\".Gostick, p. 203. Several of Hanley's later novels were derived from earlier plays.Gibbs, pp. 169, 170. Hanley also frequently published short stories and book reviews, throughout his career, and some of these stories were subsequently collected and published in book form.Gibbs. Subject matter =War fiction= Hanley experienced both World Wars. He served in the merchant navy during World War I from early in 1915 until he deserted to join the Canadian Army late April 1917. He was demobilized in the Spring of 1919. Hanley only briefly experienced frontline conflict in 1918 and was soon after invalided out.Gostick, p. He was also in London at the beginning of the World War II during the Blitz of 1940–1. Hanley deals with his First World War experiences, on the battlefield, in his novella, The German Prisoner, and his experience in the merchant navy, on a ship commandeered by the British Admiralty to serve as a troopship, in works like the novella \\"Narrative\\" (1931), and his novel The Hollow Sea (1938). These experiences are also dealt with in Hanley's non- fiction work, Broken Water: An Autobiographical Excursion (1937). The London Blitz 1941 He uses both his earlier merchant navy experience, as well as the Blitz, in subsequent novels and short stories in the 1940s and 1950s. The Hanleys left Wales in July 1939 and led \\"an unsettled, almost nomadic existence\\" part of which was spent in London, and, while living in Chelsea, in August 1940 they \\"experienced the Blitz at first hand\\".Fordham p. 162. Finally, January 1941, they returned to Wales, taking up residence in Llanfechain, Powys.Fordham, p.162 The third novel in Hanley's The Furys Chronicle, Our Time is Gone, was published in 1940, and takes place in middle of the First World War, between in November 1915, and September 1916\\".Stokes, p. 43. The action takes place mostly in Gelton. The father Denny Fury has returned to the sea, \\"as a stoker on a liner that has been taken over as a troopship,\\"Stokes, p. 61. and Desmond Fury is a captain in the army. Peter Fury is serving a fifteen-year prison sentence for his murder of Mrs Ragner. However, John Fordham comments on the fact that Our Time is Gone \\"discloses a surprisingly non-belligerent tone for a Second World War novel\\" and the \\"unprecedented\\" for a novel published during a war \\"central heroism of Joseph Kilkey\\" who is a conscientious objector.John Fordham, James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2002 p. 150. Two other works published during World War II, The Ocean (1941) and Sailor's Song (1943), explore \\"virtually identical\\" situations, that involve ships that have \\"been torpedoed and sunk mid-ocean\\".Stokes, pp. 127–8. This is a similar plot to that of the conclusion of the earlier novella \\"Narrative\\", which is set during the previous war. Hanley also published, in 1943, No Directions, which is set during the London Blitz, a work that has been commented on by several literary critics.See for example, Patrick Deer, Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire, and Modern British Literature. Oxford: OUP, 2009, pp. 141–150, and The Art of the City, Philippe Birgy. Presses Univ. du Mirail, 2010, pp. 329–333. He later re-used this novel, to form the middle section of A Dream Journey (1976). Hanley had initially planned on turning No Directions into a trilogy.Fordham, p. 230. War also has a role in several of his post Second World War novels, including Emily (1948), The Closed Harbour (1952), and Levine (1956). The eponymous protagonist of Emily meets her husband, who is on leave after spending four years away fighting the Japanese in Burma, at Paddington Station. Their home and all their possessions were destroyed in the Blitz, while it has \\"mentally shattered\\" their elder son.Stokes, p. 150. The Closed Harbour is set in Marseilles during World War II, after Germany's defeat of France, and the protagonist Eugene Marius has lost a ship in a minefield, and all but one of his crew, including his nephew drowned. As a result of this he has lost his captain's ticket and cannot find work. After months of unemployment Marius eventually descends into madness.Stokes, pp. 158–165 Levine is set in Poland during the same war and Levine witnesses the murder of his mother and abduction of his sister by invading soldiers. Subsequently he becomes a sailor. Then he is shipwrecked and spends time in an internment camp in southern England, before escaping. Levine then encounters Grace, who has been freed from her controlling parents when they are killed by a German bomb. This novel, like The Closed Harbour and many of Hanley's novels, has a tragic climax, with Levine murdering Grace.Stokes, pp. 165–174. Edward Stokes also notes that two post-war short stories collections, Crilley and Other Stories (1945) and A Walk in the Wilderness (1950), deal with the impact of war on peoples lives.Stokes, pp. 155–7. =Works set in Wales= Hanley lived a large part of his writing life, from 1931 until 1963, in Wales, and wrote several works with a Welsh setting and subject matter.Fordham, pp. 138–39, 225–26. The first full length work was Grey Children: A Study in Humbug and Misery (1937). The subject matter of this non-fiction work, unemployment in industrial South Wales, though has more in common with Hanley’s novels of the 1930s about the struggles of working class Liverpudleians. In genre Grey Children belongs with George Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier, published earlier in 1937.Fordham, p. 158. However, Hanley lived in Wales for over twenty years before he wrote at length about rural Wales, where he lived. This came in 1953, with the publication of \\"Anatomy of Llangyllwch\\", in Don Quixote Drowned. Here Hanley uses the fictional name \\"Llangyllwch\\" for his fictional portrait of the village Llanfechain, where the Hanleys moved in the early 1940s. This is on the other side of the Berwyn Mountains from Corwen, close to the English border.Fordham, pp. 203–4. A local character from Llanfechain was also the source of the central character, Rhys, in The Welsh Sonata (1954), which was Hanley’s first full-length novel with a Welsh setting.Fordham, p.210. This novel marks an important step forward in Hanley’s attempt to give form to his feelings about Wales. The Welsh Sonata is narrated from the perspective of Welsh characters, and Hanley occasional uses Welsh words, and he employs, at times, a poetic style.Fordham, p.210–13. Almost twenty years after The Welsh Sonata, in 1972, Hanley’s second Welsh novel, Another World appeared. Hanley’s third Welsh novel, A Kingdom (1978), published \\"remarkably\\" when he was 80, was his last novel.Neil Reeve, \\"Introduction\\" to the Parthian edition of A Kingdom (2014), p. iii. As he had been living in North London since 1963, this is very much written at a distance.Neil Reeve, \\"Introduction\\", p.iii. There is a suggestion of the influence of the austere poetry of Hanley’s friend, Welsh poet-priest, R. S. Thomas in this \\"elegiac evocation of hill-farm life\\".Neil Reeve, \\"Introduction\\", p. ii. Reputation Following Hanley's death in 1985 there has been the occasional reprinting, including, by Harvill The Last Voyage and Other Stories (1997) and The Ocean (1999); and more recently by OneWorld Classics, Boy (2007) and The Closed Harbour (2009), both with new biographical information provided by Chris Gostick. Several titles are also available from Fabers reprints on demand service. In 2013 Parthian Books published A Kingdom in their series \\"Library of Wales\\". Hanley's works have been translated into a number of languages, including French, German, Dutch, Spanish and Swedish.Gibbs, pp.189–191. This includes his play Inner Journey that was performed in Hamburg, Germany with the title Für Immer und Ewig in September 1966.Gibbs, p. 175. A Finnish version of his play Say Nothing was produced by the Finnish National Theatre.Anthony Burgess, \\"Introduction\\" to the Oneworld edition of Boy, 1990, p. iv. In September 2001, to mark what was then believed to be the centennial of James Hanley's birth, a one-day symposium was held at Jesus College, Cambridge. Another important landmark was the publication in 2002 of John Fordham's James Hanley: Modernism and the Working Class by the University of Wales Press, which amongst other things suggests that Hanley is not simply a realist or naturalist, but because of his use of expressionistic techniques, should be seen as a modernist.See pp. 116–7, for example. Fordham's study also contains new biographical material. Hanley never achieved major success as a writer, even though he often received favourable reviews, both in Britain and America and counted amongst his admirers E.M. Forster, T. E.

His sister, Antoinette Sithole, runs beside them. Hector Pieterson (19 August 1963 – 16 June 1976) was a South African schoolboy who was shot and killed during the Soweto uprising, when he turned around to try and pick up another stone the police opened fire on students, illegally protesting the enforcement of teaching in Afrikaans. A news photograph by Sam Nzima of the mortally wounded Pieterson being carried by another Soweto resident while his sister ran next to them was published around the world. The anniversary of his death is designated Youth Day, when South Africans honour young people and bring attention to their needs. Soweto Uprising The site where Hector Pieterson is reputed to have been shot by police. It now has a memorial to his memory. On 16 June 1976, school children protested the implementation of Afrikaans and English as dual medium of instruction in secondary schools in a 50:50 basis. This was implemented throughout South Africa regardless of the locally-spoken language and some exams were also written in Afrikaans.. Students gathered to peacefully demonstrate, but the crowd soon became intimidated when the police arrived, and started to throw stones. The police arrived and fired tear gas into the crowd in order to disperse them. There are conflicting accounts of who gave the first command to shoot, but soon children were turning and running in all directions, leaving some children lying wounded on the road. Although the media often named Pieterson as the first child to die that day, another boy, Hastings Ndlovu, was actually the first child to be shot. But in the case of Hastings, there were no photographers on the scene, and his name was not immediately known. When Pieterson was shot, he fell on the corner of Moema and Vilakazi Streets. He was picked up by Mbuyisa Makhubo who, together with Pieterson's sister Antoinette (then 17 years old), ran towards Sam Nzima's car. They bundled him in, and journalist Sophie Tema drove him to a nearby clinic where he was pronounced dead. Mbuyisa and Nzima were harassed by the police after the incident and both went into hiding. Mbuyisa's mother told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that she received a letter from Mbuyisa in 1978 from Nigeria but she has not heard from him since. Pieterson and Hastings Ndlovu are buried at the Avalon Cemetery, Soweto. Also on that day 10 people died and 250 people were injured. Surname The grave of Hector Pieterson at Avalon Cemetery, Soweto Since June 1976, Pieterson's surname has been spelled both Peterson and Pietersen by the press but the family gives the correct spelling as Pieterson. Lawsuit On 9 August 2002 U.S. lawyer Ed Fagan led a $50bn class action suit by apartheid-era victims against international firms and banks who profited from dealings with the Apartheid regime. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was Dorothy Molefi, Pieterson's mother. The South African government as well as Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Desmond Tutu distanced themselves from the lawsuit. Fagan had filed a string of lawsuits over human-rights issues brought in order to force companies to settle. The cases were thrown out in 2004. Memorial and museum On 16 June 2002 the Hector Pieterson Museum was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West, Soweto to honour Pieterson and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising. Funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (R16 million) and the Johannesburg City Council (R7,2 million), it has become a major tourist attraction. The start of the museum begins with pictures of Pieterson's death. The museum fuses memorabilia with modern technology and cultural history. As of 2010, Pieterson's sister Antoinette, who is seen in the photograph, works at the museum as a tour guide.

Through his novels, poems, and plays he exerted a profound influence on certain groups within 20th century French literature, including the Surrealists, Oulipo, and the authors of the nouveau roman. Biography Roussel was born in Paris, the third and last child in his family, with a brother Georges and sister Germaine. In 1893, at age 15, he was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire for piano. A year later, he inherited a substantial fortune from his deceased father and began to write poetry to accompany his musical compositions. At age 17, he wrote Mon Âme, a long poem published three years later in Le Gaulois. By 1896, he had commenced editing his long poem La Doublure when he suffered a mental crisis. After the poem was published on June 10, 1897 and was completely unsuccessful, Roussel began to see the psychiatrist Pierre Janet. In subsequent years, his inherited fortune allowed him to publish his own works and mount luxurious productions of his plays. He wrote and published some of his most important work between 1900 and 1914, and then from 1920 to 1921 traveled around the world. He continued to write for the next decade, but when his fortune finally gave out, he made his way to a hotel in Palermo, where he died of a barbiturate overdose in 1933, aged 56. He is buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris. Roussel's most famous works are Impressions of Africa and Locus Solus, both written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns. Roussel kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, How I Wrote Certain of My Books, where he describes it as follows: \\"I chose two similar words. For example billard (billiard) and pillard (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two sentences found, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.\\" For example, Les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux billard/The white letters on the cushions of the old billiard table… must somehow reach the phrase, …les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux pillard/letters [written by] a white man about the hordes of the old plunderer. John Ashbery summarizes Locus Solus thus in his introduction to Michel Foucault's Death and the Labyrinth: \\"A prominent scientist and inventor, Martial Canterel, has invited a group of colleagues to visit the park of his country estate, Locus Solus. As the group tours the estate, Canterel shows them inventions of ever-increasing complexity and strangeness. Again, exposition is invariably followed by explanation, the cold hysteria of the former giving way to the innumerable ramifications of the latter. After an aerial pile driver which is constructing a mosaic of teeth and a huge glass diamond filled with water in which float a dancing girl, a hairless cat, and the preserved head of Danton, we come to the central and longest passage: a description of eight curious tableaux vivants taking place inside an enormous glass cage. We learn that the actors are actually dead people whom Canterel has revived with 'resurrectine,' a fluid of his invention which if injected into a fresh corpse causes it continually to act out the most important incident of its life.\\" New Impressions of Africa is a 1,274-line poem, consisting of four long cantos in rhymed alexandrines, each a single sentence with parenthetical asides that run up to five levels deep. From time to time, a footnote refers to a further poem containing its own depths of brackets. This impressive nest of brackets carries an assertion — or a recommendation ? — buried by Roussel within a 644 alexandrine poem. In A study on Raymond Roussel,Ed. Arcanes, Paris, 1953 Jean Ferry suggested the notion of a hidden message and transcribed the succession of brackets of Cantos II into the alphabet invented by the painter Samuel Morse : considering each bracket as a dot and the included text as a dash. But due to the missing spaces which separate letters the ensemble of dots and dashes as well as a concealed message remained an hypothesis… until it was deciphered by Jean-Max Albert (another painter), revealing (at least partially) the rousselienne formula, which can’t be fortuitous : « RELIVE YOUR DREAMS AWAKE » ( Revis tes rêves en éveil).Digraphe N°67, Albert et Roussel, Mercure de France, Paris 1994.Richard Khaitzine, Fulcanelli et le cabinet du chat noir, Editions Ramuel, Paris 1997. Criticism and legacy Perhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during his lifetime and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negative. Nevertheless, he was admired by the Surrealist group and other avant-garde writers, particularly Michel Leiris, André Breton and Marcel Duchamp. He began to be rediscovered in the late 1950s, by the Oulipo and Alain Robbe-Grillet. His most direct influence in the English speaking world was on the New York School of poets; John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler, and Kenneth Koch briefly edited a magazine called Locus Solus after his novel. French theorist Michel Foucault's only book- length work of literary criticism is on Roussel. French philosopher Gilles Deleuze uses Raymond Roussel's works as one of many examples of repetition in his 1968 work Difference and Repetition. A comprehensive exhibition of Roussel's achievements entitled \\"Locus Solus\\" was exhibited within the Fundação de Serralves in Porto opening on March 24, 2012. Special attention was granted to his personal connections with Man Ray, Salvador Dalí, and Marcel Duchamp, who observed that Roussel was \\"he who pointed the way\\". References to New Impressions of Africa are central to the science-fiction novel \\"The Embedding\\" by Ian Watson (winner of the Prix Apollo in 1975). Roussel (or a version of him) is a major character in the novel \\"The Vorrh\\" by B. Catling. In 2016, The Raymond Roussel Society was founded in New York by John Ashbery, Michel Butor, Joan Bofill-Amargós, Miquel Barceló, Thor Halvorssen and Hermes Salceda.

Background, education and military career Sir Miles Lampson at the British Embassy in Cairo in 1941. Born in Mayfair, London, Lord Chandos was the son of the Rt. Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, younger son of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton. His mother was his father's second wife Edith, daughter of Archibald Balfour. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served in the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, where he met Winston Churchill, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross. From 1947 to 1955 he served as the first President of Farnborough Bowling Club, Hampshire, in his Aldershot parliamentary constituency. Business career According to the Dictionary of National Biography: > In August 1920 Lyttelton was invited to join the British Metal Corporation, > a firm established at the instigation of the British government with the > long-term strategic objective of undermining Germany's domination of the > metal trade and making the British Empire self-supporting in non-ferrous > metals. After a brief apprenticeship Lyttelton served as general manager of > the corporation and subsequently as managing director. He also became > chairman of the London Tin Corporation and joined the boards of a number of > foreign companies, including that of the German firm Metallgesellschaft. He > became one of a small group of individuals who through their multiple, > interlocking directorships, effectively controlled the global metal trade. . > . . On the outbreak of war in September 1939 he was appointed controller of > non-ferrous metals. He set about exploiting his extensive network of > personal contacts and his intimate knowledge of the mining industry in order > to secure for Britain vital supplies of metals at highly advantageous rates. > His unconventional methods caused some anxiety at the Treasury, but over the > course of the war they saved Britain a substantial amount of money. After the Conservative Party left office in 1945, Lyttelton became the chairman of Associated Electrical Industries. Political career Chandos entered Parliament as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Aldershot in a wartime by-election in 1940 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. He entered Winston Churchill's war coalition as President of the Board of Trade in 1940, a post he held until 1941, and then served as Minister- Resident for the Middle East from 1941 to 1942, and as Minister of Production from 1942 to 1945. He was again President of the Board of Trade in Churchill's brief 1945 caretaker government. After the Conservatives' 1951 election victory, he was considered for the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer, but was seen as too linked to business and the City of London, so the job was given to Rab Butler.Howard 1987, p. 178-9 Instead he became Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position which he held until 1954. The latter year he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Chandos, of Aldershot in the County of Southampton. Family home In 1948, the 5th Earl Nelson sold Trafalgar Park, Wiltshire, to John Osborne, 11th Duke of Leeds, whose brother-in-law Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos, lived there while he was an MP. Eventually Lyttleton bought the estate and lived there until 1971, when Jeremy Pinckney bought the house. Later career After ending his career as an MP, Chandos returned to Associated Electrical Industries, and steered it to become a major British company. In 1961 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \\"Jungle – or Cloister? – Some Thoughts on the Present Industrial Scene\\". =National Theatre= In 1962, Chandos became the first chairman of the National Theatre, serving until 1971. He then served as president until his death. His parents had been active campaigners for its development, and the Lyttelton Theatre, part of the National's South Bank complex, was named after him. During Laurence Olivier's tenure as director of the National, Chandos was a central figure in the controversy over a proposed production of Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. The production had been championed by Olivier's dramaturg, Kenneth Tynan. Though Olivier, a great admirer of Winston Churchill (who essentially is accused of assassinating Polish Prime Minister General Władysław Sikorski by Hochhuth) did not particularly like the play or its depiction of Churchill (whom Tynan wanted him to play), he backed his dramaturg. There was a potential problem with the Lord Chamberlain, who might not have licensed the play due to its controversial stand on Churchill. The National's board vetoed the production and Lord Chandos damned the play as a \\"grotesque and grievous libel\\". =Order of the Garter= Interior of St John the Baptist, Hagley, with the Garter banners of the 1st Viscount Chandos and the 10th Viscount Cobham Garter-encircled arms of Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos, KG, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle - viz.

Marriage & children Lord Chandos married Lady Moira Godolphin Osborne, a daughter of George Osborne, 10th Duke of Leeds on 30 January 1920. They had three sons and one daughter: * Antony Alfred Lyttelton, 2nd Viscount Chandos (born 23 October 1920, died 28 November 1980) * Hon Rosemary Lyttelton (born 30 May 1922, died 21 October 2003), married Anthony Chaplin, 3rd Viscount Chaplin in 1951. * Lieutenant Julian Lyttelton (born 30 August 1923, killed in action in Italy on 11 October 1944 during World War II ) * Hon Nicholas Adrian Oliver Lyttelton (born 26 March 1937) Lord Chandos died in Marylebone, London, in January 1972, aged 78, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Antony.

The trip arm is raised automatically whenever a train should be brought to a halt. When the signalling system determines it is safe for the train to proceed, the motor drives the trip arm down to the lowered position. The spring ensures that the trip arm is raised in all other situations, which is an essential fail-safe provision in case of failure of the electric or pneumatic power supply or of the motor driving the trip arm. If a train attempts to pass the signal with the trip arm in the raised position, the trip arm makes mechanical contact with the trip cock on the train, causing the train's brakes to be automatically applied, thereby bringing the train to a halt. Wayside trip arms are adjusted so that they rise to a point approximately above the top of the running rail when in the stop position, and lower to approximately below the top of the running rail when clear. The time taken for the arm to rise or be lowered is approximately two seconds. = Restrictions = The mechanical train stops have been found to be relatively safe with their historic models from the 19th century to be still in use in the 21st century. Because of the quadratic force increments in relation to speed these mechanical systems are restricted to low speed applications. Their continued usage can be found in urban rapid transit systems with trains making no more than 100 km/h. Whereas later contactless train stops require a working receiver on the train to initiate the emergency stop (as for PCCS or Indusi) the mechanical stops have initially been kicking the brakes directly. Because the trip arm may hit the brake lever directly, there have been installations where every wagon of a train has a separate trip cock on each bogie that has brakes. Hence in some installations the trip arm will be folded back to the safe position only a few seconds after a signal has turned red in order to reduce wear (which is an actual security risk as shown in the 1995 Russell Hill subway accident). Because of wear the trip arms for the opposite direction on the same rail will be actuated along with the trip arm for the nominal direction. Like many early systems a mechanical train stop does not inherently control speed. There were accidents where trains had overrun the overlap due to excessive speed. In order to externally control the speed of a train the operation of timed train stops has been deployed as it is widely used on the New York City Subway, where a second trip arm at a distance is folded down only a few seconds after a train has passed a check point. These expensive speed control systems are generally phased out in favour of a cab control computer that can continuously check a braking curve while approaching a signal. Types of train stops There are three types of train stops: *Trip stop - stops train trying to pass red signal *Timed train stop - stops train moving too fast *Fixed train stop - prevents any trains from passing a point =Trip stops= The trip arm is raised whenever the signal is not displaying a proceed aspect. If a train tries to pass the signal, the trip cock on the train strikes the raised trip arm and the train is brought to a halt. When the signal indicates it is safe to proceed (clear or caution), the trip arm is lowered, and a train is able to proceed without further hindrance. In some cases, the trip arm will not be lowered when the signal to which it applies is exhibiting a proceed indication, e.g. when subsidiary signals are cleared, forcing a train to trip before proceeding, thus ensuring that movements are conducted at safe speeds. =Timed train stops= With a timed train stop, the trip arm stays raised until the approaching train has shunted a track circuit on the approach for a period of time corresponding to a set speed. If the train approaches at a speed higher than the one that is set, the trip arm remains raised and trips the train to a stop. If the train approaches at a speed equal to or lower than the set speed, the trip arm lowers before the train arrives, and the train is able to proceed without further hindrance. Some timed train stops require the driver to acknowledge a stimulus before the trip arm is lowered on a yellow signal. For sections of track with lower speed limits (15–20 km/h) a simpler construction is also used. The trip arm rotates freely on a horizontal axis with a counterbalance attached to its lower end. If a train's speed is low, the arm will be rotated by the trip cock with a force insufficient to initiate braking. But if its speed is too high, force will be large due to the counterbalance inertia, causing the brakes to be applied. = Fixed train stops = With fixed train stops, the trip arm cannot be lowered. Fixed stops are positioned close to the end of a dead-end track, to stop a train before it runs out of track. They may also be used at the end of track sections beyond which certain trains should not pass, such as the end of electrified territory (e.g. Hamilton, NSW), or to test the automatic brake and tripgear of trains departing certain locations, e.g. storage sidings, near buffer stops. A fixed train stop that is the last one on a running line in the reverse direction may, despite its name, be suppressed, as is the case with the associated \\"Fixed Signals\\" on the Sydney network. Suppression is needed because in Sydney, the rear trip cock on a train is always lowered, while in Melbourne, by contrast, suppression is not required because the trip cock at the rear of a train is always raised clear of any wayside trip arm. Some railways and rail transit agencies use fixed train stops to protect workers in work zones by temporarily applying them at either end of the zone, preventing trains from incorrectly entering the work zone. Installations In 1901, Union Switch and Signal Company developed the first automatic train stop system for the Boston Elevated Railway. This system was soon adopted by the New York City Subway and other transit systems in the United States. Bulletin No. 57. Similar systems were installed around this time on the London Underground system. Because of its mechanical nature, the train stop has certain limitations in application. Severe snow and ice conditions, for example, could interfere with operation of the wayside trip arm. Its widest application, therefore, is on underground rapid transit lines, where conditions that might interfere with proper operation are readily controlled. Train stops on London Underground lines are gradually being phased out in favour of ATP and distance-to-go signalling. Train stops remain standard equipment on all RailCorp metropolitan passenger lines in New South Wales, and on the electrified suburban railway system in Melbourne, Australia. The Train stops at the Berlin S-Bahn were first installed in the late 1920s. They are named ' (or ) because of their testing and first installation on the Stettin Railway to the suburban town of Bernau. This was the first heavy rail rapid transit system with third-rail electrification in Germany. They are being phased out in favour of the ZBS system based on Eurobalises until 2025. = Trackside installation = Train stop of Berlin S-Bahn A train stop of New York City Subway, just north of the 125th street station * Berlin S-Bahn rapid transit uses a metal bar as the trip arm, positioned at the height of the first bogie, on which the trip cock is placed. The metal bar (also named \\"Streckenanschlag\\" / track stop collar) folds away to allow passing. * Berlin U-Bahn small profile underground uses a metal stick as a trip arm, which hangs over the track horizontally like a semaphore signal. The trip cock is on the roof of the first wagon (near the first door) almost looking like a lightning rod. * Berlin U-Bahn large profile underground uses a mushroom-shaped swivel next to the right rail as a trip arm. The trip cock is mounted on the first bogie. * London Underground uses a square-shaped metal plate that functions similarly to that on the New York City Subway system. * Several lines on the Moscow Metro use a semi-circle that rotates into position when signals are red. All of them are on the right side of tracks as trains' trip cocks are fitted on the right side. * New York City Subway uses a T-shaped metal bar rising from the floor as a trip arm; on the right side of the track for the A Division (numbered trains) and left side for the B Division (lettered trains). To allow trains to proceed it pivots down. A trip cock is mounted on the corner of the truck (bogie) of each car. The placement of the trip cock depends on the division the train runs on; some rolling stock is equipped with a trip cock on both sides. The train stop can be identified on the tracks because they are painted yellow for evidence if it has ever tripped a train. * Sydney now uses the London Underground type J trip arm called the JA, except that it is mirror-image mounted on the left hand side of the track instead of the right hand side. A nearly identical system is used in Wellington. * Toronto Subway also uses a T-shaped metal bar that rises from the floor except it is always on the right side of the track for all rolling stock because the trip cock is placed on the right side for all rolling stock.  Reverse direction  When trains operate in the reverse direction, they may \\"back trip\\" on train stops applying to the normal direction, which is a nuisance. This may be avoided in one of three ways: #In Melbourne the rear trip cock is raised, although this runs the risk of runaways from terminal stations at high elevations. #In Sydney, the rear trip is always lowered, and trip arms in the opposite direction are \\"suppressed\\" so that they do not engage the rear trip cock. Trip cocks on intermediate cars, if any, are always raised. #In New York, when the signalling system clears motion in one direction (on bi-directional track or through an interlocking), it will automatically drive the trip arms which apply to the other direction. This is necessary because trip cocks are located along the entire length of trains in New York, not just the lead car. On the London Underground there are many train stops on the Piccadilly line facing the opposite direction of travel. This is because they protect engineer's trains that often travel in opposite direction during engineering works.  Proving  The mechanical trip arm is proved in the lowered position before the red light of its associated signal is extinguished. The trip arm is proved in the raised position before the track circuit following that signal is indicated as unoccupied. The proving switch detects the actual arm of the train stop, and breakage of that arm centres the switch neither depressed nor normal thus alerting operators to its failure.  Tripping past, and accidents  When the signalling fails, etc., it may be necessary to \\"trip past\\" a train stop in the danger position, in accordance with the rules. With the train now working \\"on sight\\" it is important to travel at a low speed. If low speed is not maintained, then accidents can occur, such as * Roseville collision, 1950 * Berala train collision, 1952 * Glenbrook rail accident, 1999  Depiction  The car chase scene in the motion picture The French Connection shows a train stop being struck by a New York City elevated subway train as it approaches the train ahead of it on the same track. Although the moving train hits the train stop and begins to slow down, for the purposes of the film sequence, it was supposedly traveling too fast to reach a full stop before colliding with the train ahead.

It is also known as the Watkins Commission for James D. Watkins, its chairman when the commission issued its final report in 1988.  Organization  President Reagan issued creating the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic on June 24, 1987. On June 26, he appointed Dr. W. Eugene Mayberry, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, to chair the commission. Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force objected to the appointment of someone with no experience with the disease, but others praised Mayberry's experience in both medical research and clinical services. Administration officials said it would resist pressure from gay rights activists to include a representative of the gay community on the commission. Gary Bauer, the assistant to the President for policy development who would soon become head of the Family Research Council, said: \\"I would be very surprised if an administration opposed to making appointments on the basis of race or sex would agree to make an appointment based on bedroom habits\\". The commission was charged with producing a preliminary report in 3 months and a final report within a year. The president named the other commission members on July 23. Saying AIDS needed to go \\"the way of smallpox and polio\\", President Reagan announced the appointments at the commission's first meeting. They included: *Dr. Colleen Conway-Welch, dean of nursing at Vanderbilt University *John J. Creedon, CEO of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company *Dr. Theresa L. Crenshaw, a sex educator and opponent of condoms as a means of preventing the spread of HIV *Richard M. DeVos, president of Amway *Dr. Burton J. Lee III, a physician at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center *Frank Lilly, a geneticist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Lilly had served on the board of the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) from 1984 to 1986. He was \\"one of the first openly gay Presidential appointees\\". *Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., an African American and the health commissioner of Indiana and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers; named vice-chairman by Mayberry. *Cardinal John O'Connor *Penny Pullen, an Illinois legislator and advocate of mandatory premarital HIV testing and later founder of the Illinois Family Institute *Corinna \\"Cory\\" SerVaas, editor of the Saturday Evening Post *Dr. William B. Walsh, president of Project HOPE, a medical relief organization *James D. Watkins, a retired admiral At the commission's first meeting, Lilly and O'Connor, seated side by side, \\"chatted cordially\\", the New York Times reported. When the meeting ended, reporters and television cameras surrounded Lilly leaving him, he said, \\"shell-shocked\\" and \\"scared to death\\". Senator Gordon Humphrey, a New Hampshire Republican, attacked Lilly's appointment, said the President \\"should strive at all costs to avoid sending the message to society—especially to impressionable youth—that homosexuality is simply an alternative lifestyle\\" and said the President should have named heterosexual experts to the commission. The commission planned visits to review activities in several localities, beginning with a two-day visit to New York City by 5 commissioners in August/September. They visited hospitals and met with volunteers, health-care providers, and representatives of gay organizations. The commission's executive director was forced to resign in September \\"after a power struggle and allegations of inadequate performance,\\" wrote the New York Times, in which Mayberry yielded to the demands of some members of the commission for better staff support than they felt they were receiving. Lee said: \\"For whatever reason, lack of staff or whatever, things just weren't happening. With Gene Mayberry out in Rochester, Minnesota, most of the time, the commission felt we had to get a really good, high-powered, full-time person\\" to manage the commission staff. On October 7, Mayberry and Myers quit, as did the commission's senior staff adviser for medical and research affairs, Dr. Franklin Cockerill 3d, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in AIDS. Lilly said he was considering resigning but would wait to see who replaced the chairman and vice-chairman. The administration immediately announced the appointment of James D. Watkins, a retired admiral who had been Chief of Naval Operations. The New York Times said Mayberry had been \\"viewed as a moderating influence on the views of other members who are considered more ideological in their approach\\" and that \\"[b]y virtually all accounts, the commission has got off to a slow start in recruiting staff and organizing for its task.\\" Myers said that \\"The personalities are intense\\" and that \\"I don't feel the commission as currently constituted would be effective.\\" Comments from those familiar with the commission and its responsibilities expressed dismay at the resignations. Richard Dunne, executive secretary of GMHC, said: \\"The AIDS epidemic is out of control, and it seems, so is the Presidential Commission on AIDS.\\" On October 9, DeVos said that the president needed to avoid naming commissioners who were \\"emotionally\\" involved in the commission's work and that, in one newspaper's account of his statement, \\"some homosexuals want to 'capture the agenda'\\". Years later, Watkins' wife reported that Watkins told Reagan \\"I'm a sailor and a submariner, and I know nothing about medicine\\", and that Reagan replied: \\"You're exactly who we're looking for.\\" On October 11, Watkins announced plans to move quickly with reorganizing the commission staff. Noting that he was speaking to reporters on the day of a political march and rally in Washington, he said, \\"We have in Washington today one of the largest gay rights activist demonstrations that we have had—we are sensitive to them as human beings and to their issues\\". He continued: \\"We haven't done the job to date, I am sorry to say, but I feel comfortable and the other members of the commission feel comfortable that I can take it and mold them together and bring all of our prima donnas, including me, into a nice, neat, unified package.\\" He named a new executive director on October 13. Without Bauer's approval, Watkins later added two commission members who had track records as critics of the Reagan administration: Kristine Gebbie, Oregon public health commissioner and president of the AIDS Task Force of the American Society of State and Territorial Health Officers and Dr. Benny J. Primm, director of a New York City treatment program for addicts. Primm was the only African American on the commission and the only one with expertise on the intravenous drug use. Of the challenge of heading the commission, Watkins later said: \\"I really wasn't sure I could pull it out of the swamp.\\" Reports In February 1988, the commission released an interim report focused on IV drugs that called for a $20-billion, 10-year effort to fight AIDS. Watkins described it as \\"only seven-tenths of a percent of the defense budget.\\" William B. Rubenstein, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who earlier sued the commission anticipating that its membership would bias its findings, found Watkins' work \\"a pleasant surprise\\". On June 2, 1988, Watkins described the commission's draft report and called for state and federal laws to provide anti-discrimination protection for AIDS patients. He called that discrimination \\"the rule, not the exception.\\" He explained that testing and the identification of sexual partners could not be successful without such protections against discrimination: \\"So, once those with HIV are treated like anyone else with a disability, then we will find that what is best for the individual is also best for the public health.\\" He said \\"Semen, blood, and ignorance surround this epidemic, and we were in that last category\\" when starting work. In an initial review, Dr. Mathilde Krim, founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research thought the commission's work both more expert than she expected and free of ideology. Tim Sweeney, executive director of GMHC call the draft report \\"courageous, aggressive and compassionate\\" and added: \\"We challenge the President, Congress and presidential candidates to respond to this report by implementing its recommendations\\". The American Public Health Association called it \\"an aggressive first step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal with the AIDS epidemic.\\" The commission produced its final report on June 24, 1988. The commissioners approved it by a vote of 7 to 6. Its recommendations surprised observers by arguing against every measure advocating by conservative observers, such as mandatory testing, and characterizing partner notification as an inappropriate activity for medical professionals. Its principal findings and recommendations were designed to provide a national strategy for managing the epidemic. It made more than 500 recommendations, which it summarized under these headings:The Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic Report, June 24, 1988. Retrieved February 12, 2013 # replacement of the obsolete term \\"AIDS\\" (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) with the term \\"HIV infection\\"; # early diagnosis of HIV infection; # increased testing to facilitate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection; # treatment of HIV infection as a disability under federal and state law; # stronger legal protection of the privacy of HIV-infected persons; # immediate implementation of preventive measures such as confidential partner notification; # prevention and treatment of intravenous drug abuse; # implementation of drug and alcohol abuse education programs; # establishment of federal and state scholarship and loan programs to encourage nurses to serve in areas of high HIV impact; # extension and expansion of the National Health Service Corps; # aggressive biomedical research; # more equitable and cost-effective financing of care for HIV- infected persons; # addressing the concerns of health care workers; # federal assurance of the safety of the blood supply; # undertaking all reasonable efforts to avoid transfusion of another person's blood; # development and implementation of education programs; # addressing the problem of HIV-infected \\"boarder babies\\"; # addressing the problem of high-risk adolescents; # addressing ethical issues raised by the HIV epidemic; and # support and encouragement of international efforts to combat the spread of HIV infection. Vice President George Bush, who was running for President at the time, immediately endorsed both an executive order and legislation to meet the commission's call for the extension of Federal anti-discrimination protection to those with AIDS and those who test positive for HIV. He emphasized children in his discussions with reporters: \\"My conscience has been advising me on AIDS.... I'd hate it if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion and my grandson had AIDS and the community discriminated against that child, that innocent child\\". Reagan said his drug policy advisor would review the report and make recommendations to him in 30 days. President Reagan later said he opposed such discrimination in principle but took no action before his term as president ended in January 1989. The administration took small steps while ignoring the commission's central points. It acted to inform recipients of blood transfusions that they were at risk, made plans to speed FDA drug approvals, and developed proposals to add facilities for the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Anthony Fauci later described the significance of Watkins' military background to the debate over the nation's response to AIDS: \\"To have a presidential commission chairman with his background to come out so strongly against stigma and discrimination was a very, very important step\\". Randy Shilts called the report \\"a sweeping battle plan.... AIDS was war, Watkins reasoned, and in a war somebody must be in charge; that's how you get things done.\\" In response to inaction on the part of the Reagan administration, Congress passed legislation sponsored by Representative Roy Rowland, a Georgia Democrat and the only physician in Congress, that created the National Commission on AIDS. The legislation specified that commission's members must be \\"individuals with experience and/or expertise pertinent to the AIDS epidemic\\". It produced several reports over the next 4 years.

Named after the bird of the same name, she was built at Cammell Laird shipyard, Birkenhead, on the banks of the river Mersey (she was to later to be based across the river in Gladstone Dock, Bootle). She was launched on 13 October 1942 and commissioned on 1 March 1943.

Background He was born in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway). He grew up in Vesteraalen as the son of John Svaboe Steen (1798– 1872) and Christine Fleischer (1805-1851). His father was a judge and member of Parliament. His brother Frederik Steen was also a member of Parliament. He took his examen artium at Tromsø in 1844. From 1844, he was a student at the University of Christiania and received his cand.philol. in 1848. Over the next 42 years, Steen combined his profession as teacher and educationist with a political career. He served as a teacher in Bergen (1850–55) and Tromsø (1855-1866).

Built-in applications include a text editor, spreadsheet (Lotus 1-2-3 compatible), phone book and time manager. Expansion cards contain programs such as a chess game (HPC-750), a file manager (HPC-704), and a finance manager (HPC-702). Most text-based DOS applications can run on the Portfolio as long as they did not directly access the hardware and could fit into the small memory. Other expansion modules include a floppy drive, and a memory expansion unit (HPC-104). The memory expansion unit gives the Portfolio an additional 256 KB of RAM, which can be partitioned into several drives. It also features a pass-through expansion connector, allowing the use of more than one expansion unit. In theory, multiple memory expanders can be attached, increasing the available storage to over 640 KB. A card reader (HPC-301) connects to a desktop PC to read and write to the expansion cards. The kit contains an ISA card, a special cable, the card reader, and software distributed on floppy disk. A modem expansion module converts the portfolio into a miniature computer terminal. The modem is powered from the portfolio and came with an acoustic coupler consisting of two round shells that could be mounted over both ends of a handset with the aid of velcro strips. A direct connection to a telephone with a standard telephone lead is also possible. The complete terminal and coupler are portable, weighing only a few hundred grams.page with a picture of the modem expansion module Also, using the parallel port expansion module (HPC-101), a standard parallel cable and the software supplied (DOS based), the Portfolio can be connected to a PC for transferring files to and from the unit.

Normally, it is used to transport equipment of a different rail gauge. In most cases, a transporter wagon is a narrower gauge wagon for transporting a wider gauge equipment, allowing freight in a wider gauge wagons to reach destinations on the narrower gauge network without the expense and time of transshipment into a narrower gauge wagons. This is an attempt to overcome one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems-- gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of a narrower gauge construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced on a narrower gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of or so. Transporter wagons have seen varying popularity. They were quite common in Germany (where they are called '), Austria, Switzerland (here called ' in German and ' in French) and Sweden. Transporter wagons were uncommon in North America, where the practice of exchanging trucks was more common, as was at one time the case on CN's Newfoundland Railway at Port aux Basques. They were used on the Paw Paw Railroad of Paw Paw, Michigan for a short time, and on a short stretch of track of the defunct Bradford, Bordell and Kinzua Railroad by lumberman Elisha Kent Kane. They were used in the United Kingdom on the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway. Transporter flatcar Transporter wagons were used extensively for a great many years in Germany, Austria (gauge ), Switzerland ( Brünigbahn) and Sweden (gauges , , and ). This was a boon especially to exchange traffic on the extensive Swedish 891 mm network, which once comprised almost - in fact a number of local country areas in southern Sweden had nearly no (standard gauge) lines at all, just narrow gauge ones. On the other hand, Rollböcke were not much used there. An interesting development of the original transporter wagon concept (with bar couplers between each wagon) was that the bar couplers were discarded in favour of connecting all standard gauge wagons directly with each other by means of their ordinary buffing and draft gear. This was tried for a few years in Sweden just before the last narrow gauge freight lines were closed in the 1980s. Special adaptors could be employed to couple a set of transporter wagons onto the end of an \\"ordinary\\" narrow gauge freight train. Continuous braking was no problem, either, as the train air line could be incorporated into the bar couplers, too. Judging from early literature, the transporter wagon idea came about in Germany sometime around 1880 or 1890 (where in fact, later, Rollböcke were used a lot more than transporters). Transporter wagons with the unique Heberlein type friction brake system were in daily use in the old GDR (East Germany) well into the late 1980s. In Britain, they were introduced to the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway in 1904 by Everard Calthrop, who also introduced them to the Barsi Light Railway in India of 1897. They carried the bulk of the freight traffic on the Leek and Manifold Valley. Transporter wagons are widely used to get rolling stock including locomotives from gauge-isolated branch lines to main maintenance centres. = Crocodile wagons = The South Australian and Victorian Railways used broad gauge transporter wagons to carry narrow gauge rolling stock and locomotives to workshops and other isolated narrow-gauge sections. In South Australia, these were called crocodile wagons. The GWR also had crocodile wagons. One is in the Didcot Railway Centre =Transporter train in Australia= In 1955, during an intermediate phase of the replacement of the narrow-gauge () Port Pirie to Marree railway with a standard gauge line, train-lengths of standard-gauge flat wagons were fitted with narrow-gauge rails, allowing narrow-gauge trains carrying coal (from Leigh Creek coalfield), livestock or general freight to travel more quickly by standard gauge on the new, well-engineered alignment. The rails on the flat wagons were continuous, so that the upper train could be rolled on and off in one piece. The leading wagon on the narrow-gauge train was also secured to anchoring on the front wagon on the standard gauge train. Air brakes on the narrow-gauge train were connected to the standard-gauge train's air brakes. A narrow-gauge locomotive pushed the narrow-gauge train up an earthen ramp to the deck of the standard gauge train. There were no overhead structures to restrict operation of the trains. = Train on Train = \\"Train on Train\\" was a Japan Railways concept, similar to the South Australian scheme above, for hauling narrow- gauge container wagons at speeds of up to on standard-gauge Shinkansen track through the long, undersea Seikan Tunnel. = Transporter transfer stations = Between c1900 and c1950 transporter trains were used to carry narrow gauge () rolling stock between four separate NG branchlines and the workshops. The main lines were gauge. A ramp joined the narrow and broad gauge track end to end in a straight line and the ramp lifted the narrow gauge track by about one metre to the level of the rails on the broad gauge flat waggons. * Upper Ferntree Gully Upper Ferntree Gully - Gembrook * Colac - Crowes * Moe - Walhalla * Wangaratta - Whitfield * Newport workshops Transporter trailer Transporter trailer Also common on German and eastern European narrower gauge are transporter trailers, which are small-wheeled full trailers that fit beneath each pair of the wagon's wheels or each bogie of the car and are hauled by a drawbar. These are Rollböcke in German. Some times one long small-wheeled full trailer carries the entire rail car.  Road Transporter Trains  Transporter Trains are also used to carry road vehicles such as cars, lorries and buses through long rail tunnels. For long distance freight transport, trucks with trailers or semi-trailers (without tractor) are loaded on specialized rail vehicles.

GUY ROGERS; R. H. KENNETT,; J. F. BETHUNE- BAKER,. A biography by his son, Sir John Barnes, Ahead of His Age: Bishop Barnes of Birmingham, was published in 1979. Birth and education Barnes was the eldest of four sons of John Starkie Barnes and Jane Elizabeth Kerry, both elementary school head-teachers. In 1883 Barnes' father was appointed Inspector of Schools in Birmingham, a position that he occupied throughout the rest of his working life. Barnes was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and in 1893 went up to Cambridge as a Scholar of Trinity College. He was bracketed Second Wrangler in 1896 and was placed in the first division of the first class in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in 1897. In the following year he was awarded the first Smith's Prize and was duly elected to a Trinity Fellowship. During his time as a Fellow he served on the committee of Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1899 to 1901.About us « Keynes Society. Keynessociety.wordpress.com. Retrieved 18 July 2011. He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics in 1902, junior dean in 1906–1908 and a tutor in 1908. He graduated ScD of the University of Cambridge in 1907 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909. In the years that followed, Barnes was assigned to be Ramanujan's tutor and agreed with G. H. Hardy's assessment of his brilliance. Ministry In the same year he became a lecturer in mathematics, Barnes was made deacon by the Bishop of London and from 1906 to 1908 was Junior Dean of Trinity. In 1915, Barnes left Cambridge, and his career as a professional mathematician, upon his appointment as Master of the Temple in London. This was followed in 1918 by a canonry of Westminster Abbey and finally, in 1924, by consecration to the Bishopric of Birmingham, an office he held until April 1953, when he had to retire on account of ill- health. He died at his home in Sussex at the age of 79, survived by his wife and two sons. A bronze memorial tablet to him, as the third bishop of Birmingham, was erected in south aisle of Birmingham Cathedral, near where his ashes, together with those of his wife, are placed under the pavement marked by a slab with the initials \\"EWB\\". Controversies Barnes was perhaps the best known liberal bishop of his time, identified with the modernist or broad church movement. His episcopate was marked by continual controversy.The Times, Monday, 31 August 1925; p. 7; Issue 44054; col D: \\"Magical Views of the Eucharist. Dr Barnes at Oxford.\\" (Conference of Modern Churchmen). His book The Rise of Christianity (1947) attacked many Christian claims, including the Virgin Birth and the bodily resurrection of Christ.David Hein, \\"Geoffrey Fisher: Archbishop of Canterbury\\", p.lxvii ff. This led to calls that he should resign as a bishop. This Barnes refused to do. Earlier he had written \\"Should Such a Faith Offend?\\" (1927) and \\"Scientific Theory and Religion\\" (1933), and he was a contributor to 18 other books. His attack on Francis of Assisi as \\"probably verminous\\" drew a rebuke in verse from G. K. Chesterton. He was also politically active. In 1940, he lost a libel case in which he had attacked the Cement Makers' Federation for allegedly holding up the supply of cement, for their own profit at a time of great national need, in the construction of air-raid shelters.The Times, Saturday, 10 May 1941; p. 2; Issue 48922; col F: \\"High Court of Justice King's Bench Division, Slander Action Against A Bishop: £1,600 Awarded, Alpha Cement, Limited, And Others v. Bishop Of Birmingham\\" Undaunted by this set-back, Barnes returned to his accusations on the cement ring in a speech he delivered in the House of Lords the following year. Pacifism and eugenics He was an uncompromising pacifist,In 1936, his sermon Blessed are the peacemakers was published as a pamphlet by the Council of Christian Pacifist Groups, 1936 (Copy in British Library) and spoke out against British participation in the Second World War. He also expressed eugenic views.The Times, Tuesday, 22 May 1951; p. 2; Issue 52007; col C: \\"Menace of Excessive Populations Dr. Barnes on Inferior Human Strains\\" – report of the Cavendish lecture, 1951, to the Medico-chirurical Society of West London. Though a member of the Eugenic Society from 1924 until his death in 1953, it was not until after the Second World War that he openly argued in favour of voluntary sterilisation as a means to overcome the apparent prevalence of \\"mental deficiency\\" in society. Several of these eugenic-themed lectures gained significant newspaper coverage in The Times and The Manchester Guardian, sparking a fervent public debate in which inevitable – if not entirely justifiable – parallels were drawn between Barnes' arguments and Nazi ideology. In his latter years Barnes was thus a pacifist, religious leader and campaigner for the perceived declining cause of eugenics.P. T. Merricks, God and the Gene:' E.W.

Adobe Systems Inc. was a lawsuit heard in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in 2001 by Judge Dean D. Pregerson. Adobe Systems contended in a counterclaim that the original plaintiff, SoftMan, distributed unauthorized Adobe software, specifically Adobe Educational software and sold individual units the software titles that were purchased from Adobe as a single boxed \\"Collection\\". Adobe claimed that these actions are infringing Adobe's copyright and violate Adobe's terms of service. Adobe also alleged SoftMan of trademark violation by distributing incomplete versions of their software. Judge Pregerson ruled that Adobe has sold its software instead of licensed the software. Thus under the first-sale doctrine, Adobe can not control how SoftMan resells those particular copies of Adobe software after the initial sale. The Court also found that SoftMan had not infringed on the EULA because SoftMan had never run the program and therefore never assented to the terms. In addition, the Court found that factual disputes exist on whether the separately sold copies are materially different from the original copies, which is central to Adobe's trademark claim. Since Adobe was unable to demonstrate a likelihood of success on both copyright and trademark claims, the Court denied Adobe's application for a preliminary injunction against SoftMan. Background Adobe produces a suite of publishing software. SoftMan sells various software through its website, including individual copies of Adobe software that was originally part of a bundle. Adobe claims such sales are unauthorized and SoftMan is infringing both Adobe's copyright and violating terms of service that is embedded in each Adobe Software. The users need to agree to these EULA to install the software. In addition, Adobe claims that SoftMan is distributing Adobe software that is not genuine, because unbundled software does not give the customers access to Adobe's support services. Based on the aforementioned claims, Adobe applied for a preliminary injunction. Copyright and EULA claim In response to Adobe's claim, SoftMan argues that first sale doctrine allows SoftMan to unbundle and sell the Adobe software without Adobe's restrictions. Adobe asserts that it does not sell any software, rather it licenses its end users the software. Furthermore, the EULA attached to each copy of the software prohibits the \\"licensee\\" to unbundle the software. The court disagrees with Adobe's assertion. Since the purchaser pays a fixed fee to obtain the rights to use the software for an indefinite period of time and also accepts the risk commonly associated with a sale, the court determines the transactions between Adobe and SoftMan are sales. Thus, first sale doctrine applies and Adobe's copyright claims are rejected. In response to Adobe's claim that SoftMan violated terms of service described in the EULA, the court decides that SoftMan is not bound by the EULA because there was no assent. However, the court declines to comment on the general issue of shrinkwrap licenses. Trademark claim Adobe claims that the software sold by SoftMan is not genuine and is infringing on its trademark. SoftMan admits that it repackages the unbundled Adobe Software using Adobe logo. This is not considered trademark infringement under the first sale doctrine. However, the first sale doctrine does not protect any product that is \\"materially different\\" from the genuine product. Adobe argues that the resold software lacks customer and technical support that comes with original bundle. SoftMan disputes this and claims individual software can be registered separately and receive support. Since this dispute exist and not issuing an injunction is likely not going to cause irreparable injury to Adobe, the preliminary injunction is denied.

They number approximately 40 million and form Indonesia's second most populous ethnic group, after the neighboring Javanese. In their language, Sundanese, the Sundanese refer to themselves as Urang Sunda (), while Orang Sunda or Suku Sunda is its Indonesian equivalent. The Parahyangan (Priangan) highlands is the heartland of Sundanese realm; \\"When the hyangs (gods) were smiling, the land of Parahyangan was created\\". This legend suggested the Parahyangan highland as the playland or the abode of gods, as well as suggesting its natural beauty. The Sundanese have traditionally been concentrated in the provinces of West Java, Banten, Jakarta, and the western part of Central Java. Sundanese migrants can also be found in Lampung and South Sumatra, and to lesser extent in Central Java and East Java. Etymology The name Sunda derives from the Sanskrit prefix su- which means \\"goodness\\" or \\"possessing good quality\\". An example is suvarna (lit:\\"good color\\") used to describe gold. Sunda is also another name for Hindu God Vishnu. In Sanskrit, the term Sundara (masculine) or Sundari (feminine) means \\"beautiful\\" or \\"excellence\\". The term Sunda also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white. Origins and history =Migration theories= Jaipongan Mojang Priangan, a Sundanese traditional dance performance. The Sundanese are of Austronesian origins who are thought to have originated in Taiwan, migrated through the Philippines, and reached Java between 1,500 BC and 1,000 BC.Taylor (2003), p. 7. Nevertheless, there is also a hypothesis that argues that the Austronesian ancestors of contemporary Sundanese people originally came from Sundaland, a sunken massive peninsula that today forms the Java Sea, the Malacca and Sunda straits, and the islands between them. According to recent genetic study, Sundanese, together with Javanese and Balinese has almost equal ratio of genetic marker shared between Austronesian and Austroasiatic heritages. =Origin myth= The Sunda Wiwitan belief contains the mythical origin of Sundanese people; Sang Hyang Kersa, the supreme divine being in ancient Sundanese belief created seven bataras (deities) in Sasaka Pusaka Buana (The Sacred Place on Earth). The oldest of these bataras is called Batara Cikal and is considered the ancestor of the Kanekes people. Other six bataras ruled various locations in Sunda lands in Western Java. A Sundanese legend of Sangkuriang contain the memory of the prehistoric ancient lake in Bandung basin highland, which suggest that Sundanese already inhabit the region since Mesolithic era, at least 20,000 years ago. Another popular Sundanese proverb and legend mentioned about the creation of Parahyangan (Priangan) highlands, the heartland of Sundanese realm; \\"When the hyangs (gods) were smiling, the land of Parahyangan was created\\". This legend suggested the Parahyangan highland as the playland or the abode of gods, as well as suggesting its natural beauty. =Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms era= Batutulis inscription in Bogor, describes the deeds of Sunda King, Sri Baduga Maharaja, popularly known as Prabu Siliwangi. The earliest historical polity which appeared in the Sundanese realm in the Western part of Java was the kingdom of Tarumanagara, which flourished between the 4th and 7th century. Hindu influences reached the Sundanese people as early as the 4th century CE as is evident in Tarumanagara inscriptions. The adoption of this dharmic faith in Sundanese way of life was, however, never as intense as their Javanese counterparts. It seems that despite the central court beginning to adopt Hindu-Buddhist culture and institution, the majority of common Sundanese still retained their native natural and ancestral worship. By the 4th century, the older megalithic culture was probably still alive and well next to the penetrating Hindu influences. Court cultures flourished in ancient times, for example, during the era of Sunda Kingdom, however the Sundanese appear not to have had the resources nor desire to construct large religious monuments similar to those built by Javanese in Central and East Java.Hefner (1997) The traditional rural Sundanese method of rice farming, by ladang or huma (dry rice farming), in contrast to Javanese irrigated sawah wet rice cultivation (that require complex administration, coordination, and a lot of labor forces), also contributed to small populations of sparsely inhabited Sundanese villages. Geographic constraints that isolate each region also led Sundanese villages to enjoy their simple way of life and their independence even more. That was probably the factor that would contribute to the carefree nature, egalitarian, conservative, independent and somewhat individualistic social outlook of Sundanese people. The Sundanese seem to love and revere their nature in spiritual ways, leading to them adopting some taboos in order to conserve the nature and maintain the ecosystem. The conservative tendency and their somewhat opposition to foreign influences, is demonstrated in extreme isolationist measures adopted keenly by Kanekes or Baduy people. They have rules against interacting with outsiders and adopting foreign ideas, technology, and ways of life. They have also set some taboos, such as not cutting trees nor harming forest creatures, in order to conserve their natural ecosystem. One of the earliest historical records that mentions the name \\"Sunda\\" appears in the Sanghyang Tapak inscription dated 952 saka (1030 CE) discovered in Cibadak, near Sukabumi. In 1225, a Chinese writer named Chou Ju- kua, in his book Chu-fan-chi, describes the port of Sin-t'o (Sunda), which probably refers to the port of Banten or Kalapa. By examining these records, it seems that the name \\"Sunda\\" started to appear in the early 11th century as a Javanese term used to designate their western neighbours. A Chinese source more specifically refers to it as the port of Banten or Sunda Kelapa. After the formation and consolidation of the Sunda Kingdom's unity and identity during the Pajajaran era under the rule of Sri Baduga Maharaja (popularly known as King Siliwangi), the shared common identity of Sundanese people was more firmly established. They adopted the name \\"Sunda\\" to identify their kingdom, their people and their language. =Under Dutch rule= Sundanese boys playing Angklung in Garut, c. 1910–1930. Inland Pasundan is mountainous and hilly, and until the 19th century, was thickly forested and sparsely populated. The Sundanese traditionally live in small and isolated hamlets, rendering control by indigenous courts difficult. The Sundanese, in contrast to the Javanese, traditionally engage in dry-field farming. These factors resulted in the Sundanese having a less rigid social hierarchy and more independent social manners. In the 19th century, Dutch colonial exploitation opened much of the interior for coffee, tea, and quinine production, and the highland society took on a frontier aspect, further strengthening the individualistic Sundanese mindset. =Contemporary era= There is popular belief among Indonesian ethnicities that Sundanese are famous for their beauty, in his report \\"Summa Oriental\\" on early 16th century Sunda Kingdom, Tomé Pires mentioned: \\"The (Sundanese) women are beautiful, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes\\". It was said that Sundanese women are — in estimation of Indonesians — one of the most beautiful in the country. In Indonesian popular beliefs, it was said that because of the climate, they have lighter complexion than other Indonesians, and because the Sundanese diet features raw vegetables, they reputedly possess especially soft skin. Bandungite ladies, popularly known as Mojang Priangan are reputedly pretty, fashion smart and forward looking. Probably because of this, many Sundanese people today pursue careers in the Indonesian entertainment industry. Language Map showing the location of the Sundanese in Java. Sundanese scripts. The Sundanese language is spoken by approximately 36 million people and is the second most widely spoken regional language in Indonesia,Taylor (2003), p. 120-121 after Javanese. The 2000 Indonesia Census put this figure at 30.9 million. This language is spoken in the southern part of the Banten province, and most of West Java and eastwards as far as the Pamali River in Brebes, Central Java. Sundanese is also closely related to Malay and Minang as it is to Javanese, as seen by the Sundanese utilising different language levels denoting rank and respect – a concept borrowed from the Javanese. Sundanese shares similar vocabularies with Javanese and Malay. There are several dialects of Sundanese, from the Sunda–Banten dialect to the Sunda–Central Javanese dialect which mixes elements of Javanese. Some of the most distinct dialects are from Banten, Bogor, Priangan, and Cirebon. In Central Java, Sundanese is spoken in some of the Cilacap region and some of the Brebes region. It is known that the most refined Sundanese dialect — which is considered as its original form – are those spoken in Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, Garut, Bandung, Sumedang, Sukabumi, and especially Cianjur (The dialect spoken by people living in Cianjur is considered as the most refined Sundanese). While Sundanese spoken on north coast, Banten and Cirebon is considered less refined. While the language spoken by the people of Baduy is considered the archaic type of Sundanese language,The Sundanese before the Sundanese people adopt the concept of language stratification to denote rank and respect as demonstrated (and influenced) by Javanese. Today, the Sundanese language are mostly written in Latin script. An example of Sundanese-language media is Mangle Magazine that is written in Latin script. However, there is an effort to revive the Sundanese script which was used between the 14th and 18th centuries. For example, street names in Bandung and several cities in West Java are now written in both Latin and Sundanese scripts. Religion Cangkuang temple, the 8th century Hindu temple near Garut testify the Sundanese Hindu past. Akad nikah, Sundanese Islamic wedding vows in front of penghulu and witnesses. The initial religious systems of the Sundanese were animism and dynamism with reverence to ancestral (karuhun) and natural spirits identified as hyang, yet bears some traits of pantheism. The best indications are found in the oldest epic poems (wawacan) and among the remote Baduy tribe. This religion is called Sunda Wiwitan (\\"early Sundanese\\").Dadan Wildan, Perjumpaan Islam dengan Tradisi Sunda, Pikiran Rakyat, 26 March 2003 The rice agriculture had shaped the culture, beliefs and ritual system of traditional Sundanese people, among other the reverence to Nyai Pohaci Sanghyang Asri as the goddess of rice and fertility. The land of Sundanese people in Western Java is among the earliest place in Indonesian archipelago that being exposed to Indian Hindu-Buddhist influences. Tarumanagara followed by Sunda Kingdom adopted Hinduism as early as the 4th century. The Batujaya stupa complex in Karawang shows Buddhist influences in West Java, while Cangkuang Shivaic temple near Garut shows Hindu influence. The 16th century sacred text Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian contain the religious and moral rules, guidance, prescriptions and lessons for ancient Sundanese people. Around the 15th to 16th centuries Islam began to spread among the Sundanese people by Indian Muslim traders, and its adoption accelerated after the fall of the Hindu Sunda Kingdom and the establishment of the Islamic Sultanates of Banten and Cirebon in coastal West Java. Numerous ulama (locally known as \\"kyai\\") penetrated villages in the mountainous regions of Parahyangan and established mosques and schools (pesantren) and spread the Islamic faith amongst the Sundanese people. Small traditional Sundanese communities retained their indigenous social and belief systems, adopting self-imposed isolation, and refused foreign influences, proselytism and modernization altogether, such as those of the Baduy (Kanekes) people of inland Lebak Regency. Some Sundanese villages such as those in Cigugur Kuningan retained their Sunda Wiwitan beliefs, while some villages such as Kampung Naga in Tasikmalaya, and Sindang Barang Pasir Eurih in Bogor, although identifying themselves as Muslim, still uphold pre-Islamic traditions and taboos and venerated the karuhun (ancestral spirits). Today, most Sundanese are Sunni Muslims. After Western Java fell under Dutch East India Company control in the early 18th century, and later under colonial Dutch East Indies control, Christian evangelism towards the Sundanese people was started by missionaries of Genootschap voor In- en Uitwendige Zending te Batavia (GIUZ). This organization was founded by Mr. F. L. Anthing and Pastor E. W. King in 1851. However, it was Nederlandsche Zendelings Vereeniging (NZV) which sent their missionaries to convert the Sundanese peoples. They started the mission in Batavia, later expanding into several towns in West Java such as Bandung, Cianjur, Cirebon, Bogor and Sukabumi. They built schools, churches and hospitals for native people in West Java. Compared to the large Sundanese Muslim population, the numbers of Christian Sundanese are scarce; today Christians in West Java are mostly Chinese Indonesian residing in West Java, with only small numbers of native Sundanese Christians. A Hindu shrine dedicated to King Siliwangi in the Hindu temple Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta, Bogor, West Java. In contemporary Sundanese social and religious life, there is a growing shift towards Islamism, especially amongst urban Sundanese. Today, compared to the 1960s, many Sundanese Muslim women have decided to wear the hijab. The same phenomena was also found earlier in the Malay community in Sumatra and Malaysia. Indeed, modern history saw the rise of political Islam through the birth of Darul Islam Indonesia in Tasikmalaya, West Java, back in 1949, although later this Islamist movement was cracked down upon by the Indonesian Republic. In modern contemporary political landscapes, the Sundanese realm in West Java and Banten also provides popular support for Islamic parties such as Partai Keadilan Sejahtera and Partai Persatuan Pembangunan. There are numbers of Sundanese ulama and Islamic preachers who have been quite successful in gaining national popularity, such as Kyai Abdullah Gymnastiar and Mamah Dedeh who have become TV personalities through their dakwah show. There are an increasing number of Sundanese people who are consider the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) as something that enjoys social prestige. On the other side, there is also a movement led by the minority Sundanese conservative traditionalist adat, the Sunda Wiwitan community, who are struggling to achieve wider acceptance and recognition of their faith and way of life. Culture =Family and social relations= Elderly Sundanese woman near a rice paddy, at Garut, West Java. Sundanese culture has borrowed much from Javanese culture, however it differs by a much less rigid system of social hierarchy. The Sundanese, in their mentality and behavior, their greater egalitarianism and antipathy to yawning class distinctions, and their community-based material culture, differ from the feudal hierarchy apparent among the people of Javanese principalities. Central Javanese court culture nurtured in atmosphere conducive to elite, stylized, impeccably-polished forms of art and literature. In a pure sense, Sundanese culture bore few traces of these traditions.Alit Djajasoebrata, Bloemen van net Heelal: De kleurrijke Wereld van de Textiel op Java, A. W. Sijthoffs Uitgeversmaatschappij bv, Amsterdam, 1984 Culturally Sundanese people adopt a bilateral kinship system, with male and female descent are of equal importance. In Sundanese families the important rituals revolved around life cycles, from birth to death, adopting many of the previous Animist and Hindu- Buddhist, as well as Islamic traditions. For example, during the seventh month of pregnancy there is a prenatal ritual called Nujuh Bulanan (identical to Naloni Mitoni in Javanese tradition) which traces its origins to Hindu ritual. Shortly after the birth of a baby, a ritual called Akekahan (from Arabic word: Aqiqah) is performed; an Islamic tradition in which the parents slaughter a goat for a baby girl or two goats for a baby boy, the meat later being cooked and distributed to relatives and neighbours. The circumcision ceremony is performed on pre-pubescent boys and celebrated with Sisingaan (lion) dance. The wedding ceremony is the highlight of Sundanese family celebration involving complex rituals from naroskeun and neundeun omong (marriage proposal and agreement conducted by parents and family elders), siraman (bridal shower), seserahan (presenting wedding gifts for the bride), akad nikah (wedding vows), saweran (throwing coins, mixed with flower petals and sometimes also candies, for the unmarried guests to collect and believed to bring better luck in romance), huap lingkung (bride and groom feed each other by hand, with arms entwined to symbolize love and affection), bakakak hayam (bride and groom ripping a grilled chicken through holding each of its leg; a traditional way to determine which one will dominate the family which is the one that get the larger or head part), and the wedding feast inviting whole family and business relatives, neighbours, and friends as guests. The death in a Sundanese family usually performed through a series of rituals in accordance with traditional Islam, such as the pengajian (reciting Al Quran) including providing berkat (rice box with side dishes) for guests. The Quran recitation is performed daily, from the day of death through the seventh day following; later performed again on the 40th day, a year, and 1,000th days after the death. However today this tradition is not always closely and faithfully followed since growing numbers of Sundanese are adopting a less traditional Islam which does not maintain many of the older traditions. =Artforms= Wayang Golek, traditional Sundanese puppetry. Sundanese literature was basically oral; their arts (architecture, music, dance, textiles, ceremonies, etc.) substantially preserved traditions from an earlier phase of civilization, stretching back even to the Neolithic, and never overwhelmed (as eastward, in Java) by aristocratic Hindu-Buddhist ideas. The art and culture of Sundanese people reflect historical influences by various cultures that include pre-historic native animism and shamanism traditions, ancient Hindu- Buddhist heritage, and Islamic culture. The Sundanese have very vivid, orally- transmitted memories of the grand era of the Sunda Kingdom. The oral tradition of Sundanese people is called Pantun Sunda: the chant of poetic verses employed for story-telling. It is the counterpart of Javanese tembang, similar to but independent from Malay pantun. The Pantun Sunda often recount Sundanese folklore and legends such as Sangkuriang, Lutung Kasarung, Ciung Wanara, Mundinglaya Dikusumah, the tales of King Siliwangi, and popular children's folk stories such as Si Leungli. Traditional Sundanese arts include various forms of music, dance, and martial arts. The most notable types of Sundanese music are angklung bamboo music, kecapi suling music, gamelan degung, reyog Sunda and rampak gendang. The Angklung bamboo musical instrument is considered one of the world heritages of intangible culture. SambaSunda music performance, featuring traditional Sundanese music instruments such as kecapi, suling, and kendang. The most well known and distinctive Sundanese dances are Jaipongan, a traditional social dance which is usually, but mistakenly, associated with eroticism. Other popular dances such as Merak dance describe colorful dancing peafowls. Sisingaan dance is performed especially in the Subang area to celebrate the circumcision ritual where the boy to be circumcised is seated upon a lion figure carried by four men. Other dances such as the Peafowl dance, Dewi dance and Ratu Graeni dance shows Javanese Mataram courtly influences. Wayang golek puppetry is the most popular wayang performance for Sundanese people. Many forms of kejawen dance, literature, gamelan music and shadow puppetry (wayang kulit) derive from the Javanese. Sundanese puppetry is more influenced by Islamic folklore than the influence of Indian epics present in Javanese versions. The Pencak silat martial art in Sundanese tradition can be traced to the historical figure King Siliwangi of Sunda Pajajaran kingdom, with Cimande is one of the most prominent school. The recently developed Tarung Derajat is also a popular martial art in West Java. Kujang is the traditional weapon of the Sundanese people. =Architecture= Traditional Sundanese house with Julang Ngapak roof in Papandak, Garut. The architecture of a Sundanese house is characterized by its functionality, simplicity, modesty, uniformity with a little details, its use of natural thatched materials, and its quite faithful adherence to the harmony with the nature and environment. Sundanese traditional houses mostly take basic form of gable roofed structure, commonly called kampung style roof, made of thatched materials (ijuk black aren fibers, kirai, hateup leaves or palm leaves) covering wooden frames and beams, woven bamboo walls, and its structure is built on short stilts. Its roof variations might includes hip and gablet roof (combination of gable and hip roof). The more elaborate overhanging gablet roof is called Julang Ngapak, which means \\"bird spreading wings\\". Other traditional Sundanese house forms including Buka Pongpok, Capit Gunting, Jubleg Nangkub, Badak Heuay, Tagog Anjing, and Perahu Kemureb. Next to houses, rice barn or called leuit in Sundanese, is also an essential structure in traditional Sundanese agricultural community. Leuit is especially important during Seren Taun harvest ceremony. =Cuisine= A typical modest Sundanese meal consists of steamed rice, fried salted fish, sayur asem (vegetable with tamarind based soup), lalab sambal (raw vegetables salad with chili paste) and karedok (vegetable salad with peanuts paste). Sundanese cuisine is one of the most popular traditional food in Indonesia, and it is also easily found in most Indonesian cities. The Sundanese food is characterized by its freshness; the famous lalab (raw vegetables salad) eaten with sambal (chilly paste) and also karedok (peanuts paste) demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Similar to other ethnic groups in Indonesia, Sundanese people eat rice for almost every meal. The Sundanese like to say, \\"If you have not eaten rice, then you have not eaten at all.\\" Rice is prepared in hundreds of different ways. However, it is simple steamed rice that serves as the centerpiece of all meals. Next to steamed rice, the side dishes of vegetables, fish, or meat are added to provide variety of taste as well as for protein, mineral and nutrient intake. These side dishes are grilled, fried, steamed or boiled and spiced with any combination of garlic, galangal (a plant of the ginger family), turmeric, coriander, ginger, and lemon grass. The herb rich food wrapped and cooked inside banana leaf called pepes (Sundanese:pais) is popular among Sundanese people. Pepes are available in many varieties according to its ingredients; carp fish, anchovies, minced meat with eggs, mushroom, tofu or oncom. Oncom is fermented peanut based ingredients which is popular within Sundanese cuisine, just like its counterpart, tempe, is popular among Javanese people. Usually the food itself is not too spicy, but it is served with a very hot sauce made by grinding chili peppers and garlic together. On the coast, saltwater fish are common; in the mountains, fish tend to be either pond-raised carp or goldfish. A well-known Sundanese dish is lalapan, which consists only of raw vegetables, such as papaya leaves, cucumber, eggplant, and bitter melon. In general, Sundanese food tastes rich and savory, but not as rich as Padang food, nor as sweet as Javanese food. =Occupations= A Sundanese Leuit (rice barn), initially Sundanese are rice farmers. The traditional occupation of Sundanese people is agricultural, especially rice cultivation. Sundanese culture and tradition are usually centred around the agricultural cycle. Festivities such as the Seren Taun harvest ceremony are held in high importance, especially in the traditional Sundanese community in Cipta Gelar village, Cisolok, Sukabumi; Sindang Barang, Pasir Eurih village, Taman Sari, Bogor; and the traditional Sundanese community in Cigugur Kuningan.Seren Taun Bogor The typical Sundanese leuit (rice barn) is an important part of traditional Sundanese villages; it is held in high esteem as the symbol of wealth and welfare. Since early times, Sundanese have predominantly been farmers. They tend to be reluctant to be government officers or legislators.Ajip Rosidi, Pikiran Rakyat, 2003 Next to agriculture, Sundanese people often choose business and trade to make a living although mostly are traditional entrepreneurships, such as a travelling food or drink vendors, establishing modest warung (food stall) or restaurant, as the vendor of daily consumer's goods or open a modest barber shop. Their affinity for establishing and running small-scale entrepreneurship is most likely contributed by Sundanese tendency to be independent, carefree, egalitarian, individualistic and optimistic. They seem to abhor the rigid structure and rule of government offices. Several traditional traveling food vendors and food stalls such as Siomay, Gado-gado and Karedok, Nasi Goreng, Cendol, Bubur Ayam, Roti Bakar (grilled bread), Bubur kacang hijau (green beans congee) and Indomie instant noodle stall are notably run by Sundanese. Nevertheless, there are numbers of Sundanese that successfully carved their career as intellectuals or politicians in national politics, government offices and military positions. Some notable Sundanese has gained positions in Indonesian government as governor, municipal major, vice president and state ministers, also as officers and general in Indonesian military. Sundanese also popularly known as cheerful and mercurial folks, as they love to joke and tease around. The wayang golek artform of Cepot, Dawala, and Gareng punakawan character clearly demonstrate Sundanese quirky side. Some Sundanese might find art and culture as their passion and become artists, either fine art, musics or performing art. Today, there are a number of Sundanese involved in the music and entertainment industry, with some of Indonesia's most famous singers, musicians, composers, cinema directors, film and Sinetrons actors being of Sundanese origin. Notable people A depiction of King Siliwangi or Sri Baduga Maharaja, in Keraton Kasepuhan Cirebon. Notable Sundanese that being recognized as Indonesian national heroes among others are Dewi Sartika that fought for equality for women education, and Indonesian statesman such as Oto Iskandar di Nata and Djuanda Kartawidjaja. Popular former governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin, ex-vice president Umar Wirahadikusumah, and former defense minister Agum Gumelar, and ministers of foreign affairs such as Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, Hassan Wirajuda and Marty Natalegawa, Meutya Hafid are among notable Sundanese on politics field. Ajip Rosidi and Achdiat Karta Mihardja are among Indonesian distinguished poets and writers. Today, in modern Indonesian music and entertainment industry, there are large numbers of Sundanese artists that has become Indonesia's most famous singers, musicians, composers, cinema directors, film and sinetrons (TV soap drama) actors. Famous dangdut singers Rhoma Irama, Elvy Sukaesih and Ayu Ting Ting, musicians and composers such as Erwin Gutawa and singers such as Roekiah, Hetty Koes Endang, Vina Panduwinata, Nicky Astria, Nike Ardilla, Poppy Mercury, Rossa, Gita Gutawa and popular celebrity Syahrini, Indonesian sinetrons actors such as Raffi Ahmad, Jihan Fahira and Asmirandah Zantman, also stunt choreographer, movie action star Kang Cecep Arif Rahman , also film director Nia Dinata, are among artists of Sundanese background. Famous wayang golek puppet master was Asep Sunandar Sunarya, while Sule, Jojon and Kang Ibing are popular comedian. On the sports field, Indonesian athletes of Sundanese background are badminton Olympic gold medalist Taufik Hidayat and Ricky Subagja.

It is the highest point in the western massif of the Cairngorms, separated from the central section (containing Ben Macdui and Cairn Gorm) by the pass of the Lairig Ghru. The summit has a crescent shape, with several corries. In the north-facing corrie of Garbh Coire Mor the snow has completely melted just six times in the last century: 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006 and 2017 and the patches that linger there are the longest-lying snow patches in Scotland and more generally, in the entire British Isles. Probably the most commonly used route up Braeriach starts from Sugar Bowl car park, on the road leading to the Cairn Gorm ski area. From here a path leads over the hillside to a steep-sided rocky ravine known as the Chalamain Gap, before descending around to the Lairig Ghru.

It was replaced by the Daihatsu Applause. The Charmant was originally a spin-off of the Toyota Corolla of the 1970s; model changes paralleled those of the Corolla. All Charmants were fitted with Toyota inline- four engines, ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 litres. The word \\"charmant\\" is French for charming. TOC First generation (A10/A20/A30/A40; 1974–1981) First presented in November 1974, the first generation Daihatsu Charmant was based on the older E20 Corolla platform. Equipped with 1166 cc engines producing 66 PS (SAE) and 1290 cc engines producing 72 PS (SAE) at 5,200 rpm. This type of engines were coded as 3K (1.2 L) and 4K (1.3 L) Toyota engines and came with a four- or five-speed manual transmission, as well as a two-speed automatic option. The 88 PS (SAE) 1588 cc overhead valve 12T engine was also available from 1978 on; this could also be ordered with a three-speed automatic with overdrive. There was also a 1.4-litre engine available, offering 86 PS (SAE). In Japan only the 1.2- and 1.4-litre models were originally available, as the A10 and A20. These were replaced by the 1.3 and the 1.6 in April 1978 (A30 and A40), along with minor changes to the exterior and interior, including a new grille and dashboard. A protective side strip was also added. The new engines were the 4K-U and the 2T-U, while the van received the 4K-J (while retaining the T-J) - these engines fulfilled the commercial vehicle emissions specifications. In July an automatic version of the 1.6 appeared.

This was called \\"Van\\" in the Japanese domestic market, where it was classed as a commercial vehicle. The Van was introduced in December 1974, a month after the saloons. This model was exported to a fair number of countries, mostly markets without their own automobile industry. It was the first Daihatsu to be sold in Iceland, where a large number of surplus cars from the Netherlands were brought in the summer of 1979. Sold at a very low price, it was one of Iceland's most popular cars that year. Second generation (A35/A55; 1981–1987) Daihatsu Charmant LD 1600 (rear) A new Charmant was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1981 with new squarer bodywork that was somewhat outmoded already when being introduced, as was its front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Due to Daihatsu's unfamiliarity with the process of presenting new cars in Frankfurt, the car was omitted from most official press releases and several automobile writers overlooked the fact that there was a new car on Daihatsu's stand. The only bodywork available was a four-door saloon. In Japan, the biggest engine was now an SOHC with at 5600 rpm. In the export, the 1.6-litre 2T engine was also available; power outputs ranged from depending on compression ratios and intended markets. For the 1984 model year, the larger engine was changed to the overhead cam 4A unit, with an alloy head. Performance improved marginally while the gas mileage was considerably better. The smaller 1.3-litre engine, of , produced between depending on market. Trim levels were LD, LC, LE, and LGX; these continued until 1987 when the range was discontinued in the United Kingdom and most other export markets. All the engines were carburetted. In Japan, the most luxurious versions (with available climate control) were called \\"Altair\\". The Charmant had an independent front suspension (struts), and a live four-link rear axle. Suspension settings were soft, for maximum comfort. The car then underwent a minor facelift in autumn 1984. The original leaf springs at the rear were replaced by coilovers at this time. European market models became available with a catalyzed version of the 4A engine for the last few years; this fuel injected engine produces .

It rises in the Shehy Mountains on the western border of County Cork and flows eastwards through Cork, where it splits in two for a short distance, creating an island on which Cork's city centre is built, then passing through Cork Harbour on the south coast, one of the largest natural harbours in the world, to empty into the Celtic Sea. The catchment area of the River Lee is 1,253 km2. The long-term average flow rate of the River Lee is 40.4 cubic metres per second (m3/s) A hydro-electric scheme was built on the river, upstream from Cork City, and this part of the river now contains the Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra reservoirs. The river is crossed by 42 bridges, 29 of which are in Cork City, and one tunnel. The river also provides an stretch of salmon fishing. Name Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a river called Δαβρωνα (Dabrona) or Λαβρωνα (Labrona), which is sometimes considered to refer to the River Lee. Though unconfirmed, the Irish name for the river, Laoi, may derive from Corca Luighe, which in turn derives from 'Luighe', the son of a quasi- mythical Milesian noble. There is also the Λουρ (Lour) which passes through Tralee. Description =Sources= The River Lee has its source in the Shehy Mountains near Gougane Barra, where there is a forest park, chapel, hotel, and shop. =Course= River Lee north channel The Lee flows from the lake of Gougane Barra as a fast-paced torrent, but by the town of Ballingeary it eases and flows into Lough Allua. Departing the lough, running east, it again becomes a rapid flow before running into The Gearagh, and Carrigadrohid feeder reservoirs, and then into the large Inniscarra reservoir created by Inniscarra Dam. Moving on, it flows down from the dam, in normal conditions a gentle river until it comes to Ballincollig Weir in Ballincollig Park; here it is dangerous to swimmers when in high water. The Lee then flows into the city under Inniscarra Bridge and flows parallel to the Carrigrohane road. Along this section gauges monitor the water levels from the Inniscarra Dam. The river flows over the Lee weir and then is split into the north and south channels at a sluice (it historically occupied the city area as a maze of channels). This area is popular for recreation, kayaking and fishing. The two channels join again at the Cork docks and enter the extensive estuary and harbour, south of Glanmire, passing either side of Great Island (Cobh lies on the south coast) to fill the outer harbour, and reaching the open sea between Whitegate and Crosshaven. =Tributaries= Upper course (above Inchigeela) High tributaries include the Owenagariff, the Bunsheelin, the Paudeen and the Garrifowa. Middle course (to the Dripsey) Tributaries joining below Lough Allua and Inchigeela include the River Toon, the extensive Sullane River system, from near Ballyvourney (tributaries include the Douglas, Finnow, Foherish and Laney or Laine Rivers) via Macroom, the smaller Buinea and Glashagariff Rivers, and the River Dripsey and its tributares the Rylane and the Delaghinagh. Near Cork city Below the last ESB dam, tributaries joining include the River Bride from Slievowen via Crookstown and Ovens, and the Shournagh River (formed from the Blarney and Martin Rivers, and the Owennagearagh River; historically may have been the Awbeg River). City area River Lee south channel City area tributaries include the combined Maglin (from Ballincollig) and Curraheen (occasionally Curragheen) Rivers, capturing the Glasheen River also and joining at the western end of the UCC complex, and the Kiln River (sometimes Bride River) which joins by the Christy Ring Bridge in the city centre, a little west of St. Patrick's Bridge (formed in turn from a Bride River and the Kilnap or Glennamought River, later joined by the Glen River). Tidal area Estuarine tributaries include the Glashaboy River, passing Glanmire (main tributaries the Black Brook, Cloghnageshee River and Butterstown River), the Douglas or Tramore River (joined by the Trabeg River as it flows into the Douglas Channel, its estuary) which drains parts of the southern city, Owennacurra River (joined by the Dungurney River at Midleton), and the Owenaboy River almost at the final mouth of the outer Lee estuary (the Liberty Stream joins this river, with significant flows from Cork Airport). Recreation Recreation activities on the Lee include sailing, from a sailing club based on Inniscarra lake, where people also swim. There is a kayak club based on the Lee Road. Water skiing also takes place on Inniscarra lake and several rowing clubs are based on the Lee including the \\"Lee Rowing Club\\", \\"Shandon Boat Club\\" and “Cork Boat Club”. Naomhoga Chorcai is also based on the Marina, and is Ireland's largest Currach (traditional canvas fishing boat) rowing club. Angling is also common from the banks of the Lee Fields. Flooding In 2009, water was released in large quantities from the Inniscarra Dam, causing flood damage in Cork City Tidal considerations, combined with low-lying urban developments, and later dam management contribute to repeated flooding events on the Lee. For example, specific streets in Cork city centre have been affected by floods more than 100 times since the mid-19th century. =2009 flooding= In late 2009 the river flooded, causing some of the most significant damage in Cork city for a number of centuries. The Lee Water Station was forced to shut down after being submerged under six metres of water, and resulted in 40% of Cork City (50,000 people) being without running water for over a week. Independent.ie's summary on the flood Lower-lying parts of the University College Cork campus were also flooded extensively, resulting in lectures being cancelled throughout the week. UCC's Notification webpage on the floods There was severe damage to the university's then newly built IT building, the Western Gateway Building, situated next to the river on a known floodplain, where, for example, a 300-seat auditorium was flooded to near ceiling height. PDF file on the damages To prevent issues upstream, the ESB made a controversial decision to release water from the Inniscarra hydro-electric dam. This released 535 tonnes of water per second into the already flooded river, raising the flood to 1.5 metres in parts of the city centre. The ESB insisted this was an essential move, and if water had not been released, the flooding would have been much worse.

In the United States road work could also mean any work conducted in close proximity of travel way (thoroughfare) such as utility work or work on power lines (i.e. telephone poles). The general term of road work is known as work zone. Roadworks can, however, also happen when a major accident occurs and road debris from the crash needs to be cleared. thumbleftGerman roadworks sign. In other European countries, the signs are similar. A typical MUTCD sign Roadworks are often signposted, although it is possible that the signage comes too late or too sudden or is missing. Typical road work traffic controls are temporary signs, traffic cones, barrier boards and t-top bollards as well as other forms of warning devices. There are standards of temporary traffic control (maintenance of traffic) established in each country for various type of road work. In some countries, where lanes must be altered so as to accommodate roadworks, the new lanes (or interim lanes) are marked with a different colour and take precedence over the previous lanes. In Germany, Poland and many other European countries, it is yellow; in Switzerland and in Ireland, it is orange. Roadworks are frequently carried out throughout the night so as to minimize traffic disruption. Currently there are very few sources of accurate roadworks information sites available that report on the status of current works and future works. In the UK the Roadworks.org website, an initiative run by ELGIN, aims to provide a national and live dataset of roadworks for the purpose of coordination and reporting. It includes roadworks information supplied by Local Authorities and national agencies like the Highways Agency.

The standard is published by the Thai Industrial Standards Institute (TISI), an organ of the Ministry of Industry under the Royal Thai Government, and is the sole official standard for encoding Thai in Thailand. The descriptive name of the standard is \\"Standard for Thai Character Codes for Computers\\" (Thai: รหัสสำหรับอักขระไทยที่ใช้กับคอมพิวเตอร์). \\"2533\\" refers to year 2533 of the Buddhist Era (1990), the year the present version of the standard was published; a previous revision, TIS 620-2529 (1986), is now obsolete. TIS-620 is the IANA preferred charset name for TIS-620, and that charset name is used also for ISO/IEC 8859-11 (which adds a no-break space character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Structure TIS-620 is a conventionally structured Extended ASCII national character set that retains full compatibility with 7-bit ASCII and uses the 8-bit range hex A1 to FB for encoding the Thai alphabet. Due to the complex combining nature of Thai vowels and diacritics, TIS-620 is intended for information interchange only, and an additional display engine is required to compose characters correctly. Variants A nearly identical version of TIS-620 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 8859-11 in 2001, the sole difference being that ISO/IEC 8859-11 defines hex A0 as a non-breaking space, while TIS-620 leaves it undefined but reserved. (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.) The ISO/IEC 8859-11 set has also been registered as ISO-IR-166 by Ecma International, but this variation adds explicit escape codes for signaling the beginning and end of Thai character sequences. The TIS-620 character set ordering has been used essentially as is within Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) as well. Unicode's Thai block is U+0E01 through U+0E7F, and TIS-620 Thai characters can be converted to UTF-16 simply by prefixing each byte with 0E and subtracting hex A0 from the value.

It has the chemical formula CH3(CH)4CO2H. It is a colourless solid that is slightly soluble in water and sublimes readily. It was first isolated from the unripe berries of the Sorbus aucuparia (rowan tree), hence its name. Production The traditional route to sorbic acid involves condensation of malonic acid and trans-butenal. It can also be prepared from isomeric hexadienoic acids, which are available via a nickel- catalyzed reaction of allyl chloride, acetylene, and carbon monoxide. The route used commercially, however, is from crotonaldehyde and ketene.Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, page 8482 An estimated 30,000 tons are produced annually.Erich Lück, Martin Jager and Nico Raczek \\"Sorbic Acid\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim, 2000. History Sorbic acid was isolated in 1859 by distillation of rowanberry oil by A. W. von Hofmann. This affords parasorbic acid, the lactone of sorbic acid, which he converted to sorbic acid by hydrolysis. Its antimicrobial activities were discovered in the late 1930s and 1940s, and it became commercially available in the late 1940s and 1950s. Beginning in the 1980s, sorbic acid and its salts were used as inhibitors of Clostridium botulinum in meat products to replace the use of nitrites, which can produce carcinogenic nitrosamines. Properties and uses With a pKa of 4.76, it is about as acidic as acetic acid. Sorbic acid and its salts, such as sodium sorbate, potassium sorbate, and calcium sorbate, are antimicrobial agents often used as preservatives in food and drinks to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi. In general the salts are preferred over the acid form because they are more soluble in water, but the active form is the acid. The optimal pH for the antimicrobial activity is below pH 6.5. Sorbates are generally used at concentrations of 0.025% to 0.10%. Adding sorbate salts to food will, however, raise the pH of the food slightly so the pH may need to be adjusted to assure safety. It is found in foods such as cheeses and breads. The E numbers are: * E200 Sorbic acid * E201 Sodium sorbate * E202 Potassium sorbate * E203 Calcium sorbate Some molds (notably some Trichoderma and Penicillium strains) and yeasts are able to detoxify sorbates by decarboxylation, producing trans-1,3-pentadiene. The pentadiene manifests as a typical odor of kerosene or petroleum. Other detoxification reactions include reduction to 4-hexenol and 4-hexenoic acid. Sorbic acid can also be used as an additive for cold rubber, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of some plasticizers and lubricants. Safety The value of sorbic acid is estimated to be between 7.4 and 10 g/kg. Sorbic acid and sorbates therefore have a very low mammalian toxicity – hence their extensive use in food and beverage preservation. Sorbic acid occurs naturally in wild berries, is relatively unstable and rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is considered environmentally friendly. In the body it is generally metabolized by the same oxidation pathway as the 5-carbon saturated fatty acid caproic acid. There is a general consensus that sorbic acid and sorbates are intrinsically devoid of carcinogenic activity. However they have been shown to have the potential to undergo conversion to potential mutagens either through oxidation, or through a chemical reaction with nitrites at pH of 2-4.2 – the latter conditions being ones that mimic the gastric environment. In living yeast cells sorbic acid enhances oxygen free radical formation by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to damage to the mitochondrial DNA.

He is particularly known for his work with gender identity disorder patients. Richard Curtis took over his practice after his retirement. Reid grew up in New Zealand and worked privately in the United Kingdom. Britain's best-known expert on gender reassignment, he was a member of the parliamentary forum on transsexualism. In 2006–2007, Reid was investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC), the regulatory body for doctors in the UK. A serious professional misconduct hearing opened following complaints brought by four doctors from the main NHS Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross hospital, west London, and some of his former patients. It is alleged that he breached international standards of care, set by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) by inappropriately prescribing cross-gender hormones to patients and referring them for sex reassignment surgery without adequate assessment. Britain's primary lobbying organization for transgender and transsexual people, Press for Change, was quoted as saying that Reid received support during the process from more than 150 patients as well as additional experts in the area. Ultimately, the enquiry found Reid guilty of Serious Professional Misconduct, mostly for failing to communicate fully with patients GPs and not documenting his reasons for departing from the HBIGDA Standards of Care guidelines sufficiently. However, the panel \\"determined that it would be in the public interest as well as your own interests if you were to return to practice under strict conditions.\\" and allowed him to return to practice, subject to some restrictions on his practice and hormone prescriptions for the next 12 months. Reid was a member of an expert committee set up by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to draw up new UK care guidelines on the treatment of Gender identity disorder. He stepped down as a member of the group in the wake of the GMC inquiry. Reid was also interviewed as part of a BBC documentary, Complete Obsession, dealing with patients seeking limb amputations.

Amateur career Reid had a stellar amateur boxing career, culminating with a come-from-behind, one-punch knock out win to secure a gold medal at the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. This followed Reid's title victory a year earlier at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata. Because he was, like Oscar De La Hoya four years before, the only Olympic gold medalist in boxing for the United States, comparisons by writers and critics to de la Hoya were practically inevitable. De la Hoya's nickname is \\"The Golden Boy\\"; Reid was dubbed as \\"The American Dream\\". =Amateur highlights= *1993 National Golden Gloves Welterweight champion *1994 United States Amateur Welterweight champion *1996 United States Amateur Light middleweight champion *Won the Light Middleweight gold medal for the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, United States.

He followed his debut victory with four knockout wins in a row, before meeting former world Welterweight champion Jorge Vaca, on October 3 of the same year, also at Atlantic City. He knocked Vaca out in the first round. His next bout, against Dan Conolly, was showcased on HBO Boxing, and it was also covered, round by round, by The Ring. Reid earned his sixth victory in a row, knocking out Conolly (who was described by The Ring magazine as a \\"game opponent\\") in five rounds. On January 31, 1998, he dropped Robert Frazier in the first round. Despite losing a point in round six due to what the fight's referee thought was dirty tactics, Reid went on to beat Frazier by an eight round unanimous decision. After two more wins, he faced former world champion Simon Brown, knocking him out in four rounds on June 27, at Reid's hometown. On October 24, he claimed his first belt, defeating James Cocker by a twelve round unanimous decision, to win the WBC's Continental Americas light middleweight title. =WBA light middleweight champion= After that victory, he was deemed as ready for a world title try by his management team, and so, on March 6, 1999, Reid became a world champion in only his tenth professional bout (making him one of the boxers to win a world title in the fastest time, also like the second Davey Moore), by beating WBA light middleweight champion Laurent Boudouani by a twelve round unanimous decision in Atlantic City. Reid would defend his title successfully twice, one of them, a twelve round unanimous decision over Keith Mullings in Las Vegas. By then, Reid had already made Las Vegas his new home. There was much talk about facing him against a number of opponents, including Roy Jones Jr., Bernard Hopkins, De La Hoya and Félix Trinidad. = Trinidad vs Reid Bout = The only fight out of those four possible match-ups came on March 3, 2000, when he defended his crown against Trinidad in Las Vegas. Reid enjoyed some advantage during the first six rounds, having dropped Trinidad in the third, and with the fight being close on all three judges' scorecards. He was dropped in round seven, however, and subsequently suffered a detached retina and three more knockdowns in round eleven, before losing the world title by a twelve round unanimous decision. Many fans then questioned his management's judgment by letting Reid defend his title against a veteran like Trinidad in only his fifteenth professional bout, a fact that reminded many of the case of the second Davey Moore 17 years before, when he defended the same WBA title, in only his thirteenth bout, against the far more experienced, boxing hall of famer Roberto Durán. Many critics say that the reason for Reid's falldown after his defeat to Trinidad could be due to a psychological break-down, but the fact is that his detached retina affected him for the rest of his short career. Retirement He returned to the boxing ring for four bouts. He won three fights against insignificant opposition, then lost to Sam Hill by a knockout in nine rounds, in what would turn out to be his last bout, on November 11, 2001, at Elizabeth, Indiana. His retina was causing him more trouble, and he retired before losing his eyesight. Reid had first suffered an eye injury in the 1995 Olympic Trials, and after several surgeries as a professional, he continued to suffer from ptosis. Reid had a professional record of 17 wins and two losses, with 7 wins by knockout.

Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 74. The purpose of cultural diplomacy is for the people of a foreign nation to develop an understanding of the nation's ideals and institutions in an effort to build broad support for economic and political goals.Mary N. Maack, \\"Books and Libraries as Instruments of Cultural Diplomacy in Francophone Africa during the Cold War,\\" Libraries & Culture 36, no. 1 (Winter 2001): 59. In essence \\"cultural diplomacy reveals the soul of a nation\\", which in turn creates influence.United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 3. Though often overlooked, cultural diplomacy can and does play an important role in achieving national security efforts.  Definition  Culture is a set of values and practices that create meaning for society. This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses).Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 22. This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. It is a type of soft power, which is the \\"ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies.\\"Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 18. This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. Cultural diplomacy is also a component of public diplomacy. Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to \\"amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large\\".Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 15. It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where there is already a relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. This comes from knowledge of the other's culture.\\"Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 30. Cultural diplomacy has been called the \\"linchpin of public diplomacy\\" because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked. Richard T. Arndt, a former State Department cultural diplomacy practitioner, said \\"Cultural relations grow naturally and organically, without government intervention – the transactions of trade and tourism, student flows, communications, book circulation, migration, media access, inter-marriage – millions of daily cross-cultural encounters. If that is correct, cultural diplomacy can only be said to take place when formal diplomats, serving national governments, try to shape and channel this natural flow to advance national interests.\\"\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 74-75. It is important to note that, while cultural diplomacy is, as indicated above, a government activity, the private sector has a very real role to play because the government does not create culture, therefore, it can only attempt to make a culture known and define the impact this organic growth will have on national policies. Cultural diplomacy attempts to manage the international environment by utilizing these sources and achievements and making them known abroad.Nicholas J. Cull, \\"Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 33. An important aspect of this is listening- cultural diplomacy is meant to be a two-way exchange.United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 7 . This exchange is then intended to foster a mutual understanding and thereby win influence within the target nation. Cultural diplomacy derives its credibility not from being close to government institutions, but from its proximity to cultural authorities.Nicholas J. Cull, \\"Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 36. It is seen as a silent weapon in gaining control over another nation with the use of non-violent methods to perpetrate a relationship of mutual understanding and support among the countries involved.  Purpose  Ultimately, the goal of cultural diplomacy is to influence a foreign audience and use that influence, which is built up over the long term, as a sort of good will reserve to win support for policies. It seeks to harness the elements of culture to induce foreigners to:\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 77. * have a positive view of the country's people, culture and policies, * induce greater cooperation between the two nations, * aid in changing the policies or political environment of the target nation, * prevent, manage and mitigate conflict with the target nation. In turn, cultural diplomacy can help a nation better understand the foreign nation it is engaged with and it fosters mutual understanding. Cultural diplomacy is a way of conducting international relations without expecting anything in return in the way that traditional diplomacy typically expects.\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 89. Cultural exchange programs work as a medium to relay a favourable impression of the foreign country in order to gain outsiders' understanding and approval in their cultural practices and naturalize their social norms among other cultures. Generally, cultural diplomacy is more focused on the longer term and less on specific policy matters. The intent is to build up influence over the long term for when it is needed by engaging people directly. This influence has implications ranging from national security to increasing tourism and commercial opportunities.Mark Leonard, \\"Diplomacy by Other Means,\\" Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 51. It allows the government to create a \\"foundation of trust\\" and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to- people contact. Another unique and important element of cultural diplomacy is its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit. In short, cultural diplomacy plants the seeds of ideals, ideas, political arguments, spiritual perceptions and a general view point of the world that may or may not flourish in a foreign nation.United States, Department of State, Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, Diplomacy Report of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, 3, 4, 9. Therefore, ideologies spread by cultural diplomacy about the values that American people believe in enables those that seek a better life to look towards the Western world where happiness and freedom are portrayed as desirable and achievable goals.  Link to national security  First and foremost, cultural diplomacy is a demonstration of national power because it demonstrates to foreign audiences every aspect of culture, including wealth, scientific and technological advances, competitiveness in everything from sports and industry to military power, and a nation's overall confidence.\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 76. The perception of power obviously has important implications for a nation's ability to ensure its security. Furthermore, because cultural diplomacy includes political and ideological arguments, and uses the language of persuasion and advocacy, it can be used as an instrument of political warfare and be useful in achieving traditional goals of war.\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 93. A Chinese activist was quoted as saying \\"We've seen a lot of Hollywood movies – they feature weddings, funerals and going to court. So now we think it's only natural to go to court a few times in your life.\\"Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 23. This is an example of a cultural export – Hollywood movies – possibly having a subtle effect on the legal system in China, which could ultimately benefit the United States or any other nation which wishes to see a more democratic China. This is the way in which ideas and perceptions can ultimately affect the ability of a nation to achieve its national security goals. In terms of policy that supports national security goals, the information revolution has created an increasingly connected world in which public perceptions of values and motivations can create an enabling or disabling environment in the quest for international support of policies.Mark Leonard, \\"Diplomacy by Other Means,\\" Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 49. The struggle to affect important international developments is increasingly about winning the information struggle to define the interpretation of states' actions. If an action is not interpreted abroad as the nation meant to it be, then the action itself can become meaningless.Jamie Frederic Metzl, \\"Popular Diplomacy,\\" Daedalus 128, no. 2 (Spring 1999): 178. Cultural diplomacy can create an environment in which a nation is received as basically good, which in turn can help frame its actions in a positive light. Participants in cultural diplomacy often have insights into foreign attitudes that official embassy employees do not. This can be used to better understand a foreign nation's intentions and capabilities. It can also be used to counter hostile propaganda and the collection of open-source intelligence.\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 78-79. Overall, cultural diplomacy has the potential to demonstrate national power, create an environment conducive to support, and assist in the collection and interpretation of information. This, in turn, aids in the interpretation of intelligence, enhances a nation's prestige and aids in garnering support for policies abroad. All of these factors affect a nation's security, thus, cultural diplomacy has an effect on, and a role to play, in regards to national security. Tools and examples Cultural diplomacy can and does utilize every aspect of a nation's culture. This includes:\\"Cultural Diplomacy, Political Influence, and Integrated Strategy,\\" in Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda, and Political Warfare, ed. Michael J. Waller (Washington, DC: Institute of World Politics Press, 2009), 82-87. * The arts including films, dance, music, painting, sculpture, etc. * Exhibitions which offer the potential to showcase numerous objects of culture * Educational programs such as universities and language programs abroad * Exchanges- scientific, artistic, educational etc. * Literature- the establishment of libraries abroad and translation of popular and national works * Broadcasting of news and cultural programs * Gifts to a nation, which demonstrates thoughtfulness and respect * Religious diplomacy, including inter-religious dialogue * Promotion and explanation of ideas and social policies All of these tools seek to bring understanding of a nation's culture to foreign audiences. They work best when they are proven to be relevant to the target audience, which requires an understanding of the audience. The tools can be utilized by working through NGOs, diasporas and political parties abroad, which may help with the challenge of relevance and understanding.Mark Leonard, \\"Diplomacy by Other Means,\\" Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 51, 52. These tools are generally not created by a government, but produced by the culture and then the government facilitates their expression abroad to a foreign audience, with the purpose of gaining influence. = The arts = Migrant Mother (1936), Dorothea Lange In the 1950s the Soviet Union had a reputation that was associated with peace, international class solidarity and progress due to its sponsorship of local revolutionary movements for liberation. The United States was known for its involvement in the Korean War and for preserving the status quo. In an effort to change this perception, the United States Information Agency (USIA) sponsored a photographic exhibition titled The Family of Man. The display originally showed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, but then USIA helped the display to be seen in 91 locations in 39 countries. The 503 photographs by 237 professional and amateur photographers were curated and put together by Edward Steichen. The images showed glimpses of everyday human life in its various stages; courtship, birth, parenting, work, self-expression, etc., including images from the Great Depression. The images were multi-cultured and only a few were overtly political serving to show the eclecticism and diversity of American culture, which is America's soft power foundation. The display was extremely popular and attracted large numbers of crowds, in short America \\"showed the world, the world and got credit for it\\".Nicholas J. Cull, \\"Public Diplomacy: Taxonomies and Histories,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 39-40. A similar effort was carried out by the United States Department of State in February 2002 entitled Images from Ground Zero. The display included 27 images, detailing the September 11 attacks by Joel Meyerowitz that circulated, with the backing of embassies and consulates, to 60 nations. The display was intended to shape and maintain the public memory of the attack and its aftermath. The display sought to show the human side of the tragedy, and not just the destruction of buildings. The display was also intended to show a story of recovery and resolution through documenting not only the grief and pain, but also the recovery efforts. In many countries where the display was run, it was personalized for the population. For example, relatives of those who died in the Towers were often invited to the event openings.Liam Kennedy, \\"Remembering September 11: Photography as Cultural Diplomacy,\\" International Affairs 79, no. 2 (March 2003): 315-323. In this way, the US was able to put their own spin on the tragedy and keep the world from forgetting. = Exhibitions = Pepsi SU label Exhibitions were often used during the Cold War to demonstrate culture and progress by both the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1959, the American National Exhibition was held on Sokolniki Park in Moscow. The exhibition was opened by Vice President Richard Nixon and attended by Walt Disney, Buckminster Fuller, William Randolph Hearst, and senior executives from Pepsi, Kodak and Macy's. It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of American products such as Pepsi. There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird's Eye frozen meal be prepared. An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian. The most popular question was \\"what is the meaning of the American Dream?\\" The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition. But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country. The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it out anyway. The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue. The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian. This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions. The ambassador to Moscow, Llewellyn Thompson, commented that \\"the exhibition would be 'worth more to us than five new battleships.\\"Nicholas John. Cull, The Cold War and the United States Information Agency: American Propaganda and Public Diplomacy, 1945-1989 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 162-167. Exhibitions like this were used to display the best a culture had to offer and basically show off in a way that appeared non threatening and even friendly. =Exchanges= New US- UK Fulbright Logo Riccardo Giacconi The usefulness of exchanges is based on two assumptions- some form of political intent lies behind the exchange and the result will have some sort of political effect. The idea is that exchanges will create a network of influential people abroad that will tie them to their host country and will appreciate their host country more due to their time spent there.Giles Scott-Smith, \\"Mapping the Undefinable: Some Thoughts on the Relevance of Exchange Programs within International Relations Theory,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 16 (March 2008): 174. Exchanges generally take place at a young age, giving the host country the opportunity to create an attachment and gain influence at a young impressionable age. An example of the possible usefulness of exchanges is provided by the United States Fulbright Program. Some statistics include: * 59 alumni from 14 countries have been awarded the Nobel Prize * 82 alumni have received Pulitzer Prizes * 37 Fulbright alumni have served as heads of state or government Some Prominent Fulbright alumni include: * Garry Conille, Former Prime Minister of Haiti * Muhammad Yunus, Founder of Grameen Bank and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize recipient * John Atta Mills, President of Ghana * Lee Evans, Olympic Gold Medalist * Riccardo Giacconi, physicist and 2002 Nobel Laureate * Renée Fleming, soprano * Jonathan Franzen, writer This is not to say that exchanges guarantee that participants will look favorably upon their host nation, but the hope is that they will. = TV, music, film= Popular entertainment is a statement about the society which it is portraying. These cultural displays can carry important messages regarding individualism, consumer choices and other values. For example, Soviet audiences watching American films learned that Americans owned their own cars, did not have to stand in long lines to purchase food, and did not live in communal apartments.Carnes Lord, Losing Hearts and Minds?: Public Diplomacy and Strategic Influence in the Age of Terror (Westport, CT: Praeger Security International, 2006), 52. These observations were not intended to be political messages when Hollywood created the films, but they none-the-less carried a message. Cultural programming featuring Latin Jazz music and the Bolero was already recognized by the United States Department of State as an important diplomatic tool during the World War II period. In the early 1940s, Nelson Rockefeller at the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs collaborated with Edmund A. Chester of the CBS radio broadcasting network in order to showcase leading musicians from both North and South America for audiences on both continents. Musical artists such as Alfredo Antonini, Terig Tucci, John Serry Sr., Miguel Sandoval, Juan Arvizu, Elsa Miranda, Eva Garza and Nestor Mesta Chayres participated in this truly international effort to foster peace throughout the Americas through shared musical performances (See Viva América).The New York Times, January 8, 1941, pg. 8The New York Times, January 1, 1942, pg. 27The New York Times, May 10, 1942, pg.

University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, 2012 Pg. 49 Books.Google.Com See Pg. 49 In the post World War II era, the United States Army also acknowledged the importance of cultural programming as a valuable diplomatic tool amidst the ruins in Europe. In 1952 the U.S. Seventh Army enlisted the expertise of the young conductor Samuel Adler to establish the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra in Stuttgart, Germany in order to demonstrate the shared cultural heritage of America and Europe.

Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative way of living by introducing a new style of music with a loose structure and improvisation.Richmond, Yale. Cultural Exchange and the Cold War: Raising the Iron Curtain. (University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 2004), 205-209.Von Eschen, Penny M., Satchmo Blows Up the World: Jazz Ambassadors Play the Cold War. (Harvard University Press, 2004), 10, 13, 34, 225. In November 1955, the New York Times declared Louis Armstrong as America's most effective ambassador. What American diplomats could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did. This article claimed that musicians, such as Armstrong, created a universal language to communicate. Jazz originally surfaced in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, but quickly faded. After World War II, jazz began to reemerge, but was condemned by Andrei Zhdanov. He considered jazz as corrupt and capitalistic due to the fact that it grew out of the United States during a time of political unrest.Fosler-Lussier, Danielle, \\"Jazz Diplomacy: Promoting America in Cold War Era by Lisa E. Davenport (review),\\" American Music 31, no. 1, (Spring 2013), 117-118. During the 1950s to 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement, the decolonization of Africa and Asia, and the cultural and political rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union created the need for cultural exchange. As a result, the United States government sent a jazz band composed of African American musicians abroad to tour places, including the Middle East and Africa, with the goal of the black musicians establishing connections with their African heritage. Duke Ellington, B.B. King, and Dizzy Gillespie all made trips to Africa that fostered connections with the African diaspora. In 1956, Dizzy Gillespie took on the role as a musical ambassador during his trip to the Middle East. He reported to President Eisenhower that he and his jazz band were effective against Red propaganda. With their interracial group, the jazz band was able to communicate across social and language barriers. During the band's trip to Athens, Greece, a performance transformed an audience of Anti-American students angered by the U.S. stance on Greece's right-wing dictatorship. By the end of the performance, Gillespie said the audience loved the music and threw him up on their shoulders after the performance. Diplomats emphasized the positive effects of musical diplomacy on the public. From 1955 to 1996, jazz producer Willis Conover hosted a music program called \\"Music USA,\\" for the Voice of America to assist in the emergence of jazz musicians as U.S. ambassadors. Conover explained: \\"Jazz is a cross between total discipline and anarchy,\\" for the way the musicians agree on tempo, key, and chord, but is distinguishable by its freedom of expression. As many as thirty million listeners worldwide, including millions in the Soviet Union, listened to the forty-five minutes of pop music and forty-five minutes of jazz with a newscast preceding each. Many critics have stated that Conover's program played a major role in the resurgence of jazz within the Soviet Union after the WWII. Many historians believe that this freedom aspect of jazz was representative of the American culture during this time. The Fabs The effect The Beatles had in Russia during the Cold War is an example of how music artists and their songs can become political. During this time, rock music channelled liberal \\"Western\\" ideas as a progressive and modernized art form. The Beatles symbolized the Western culture in a way that introduced new ideas that many believe assisted in the collapse of communism.John Alter, \\"You say you want a revolution,\\" Newsweek (September 22, 2003): 37. As a result, the Beatles served as cultural diplomats through their popularity in the Soviet Union. Their music fostered youth communication and united people with a common spirit of popular culture. Kolya Vasin, the founder of The Beatles museum and the Temple of Love, Peace and Music in St. Petersburg, commented that The Beatles \\"were like an integrity test. When anyone said anything against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us.\\" Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government to prevent the spread of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music.Bratersky, Alexander, \\"Back in the USSR: the Beatles shaped a generation in Soviet Russia,\\" Russia: beyond the headlines.(November 8, 2012). Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – \\"Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies.\\" Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a \\"source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...\\". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system. In this way the music of The Beatles struck a political chord in the Soviet Union, even when the songs were not meant to be political. This contact went both ways. In 1968, when the song \\"Back in the USSR\\" was released, the album included a quote on the cover from Paul McCartney that read \\"In releasing this record, made especially and exclusively for the USSR, I am extending a hand of peace and friendship to the Soviet people.\\" During Paul McCartney's first trip to Russia in May 2003, nearly half a million fans greeted him. One Russian critic reported, \\"The only person in Red Square who wasn't moved was Lenin\\". This is an example of how products of culture can have an influence on the people they reach outside of their own country. It also shows how a private citizen can unintentionally become a cultural ambassador of sorts. =Place branding= This Image and reputation has become an essential part of a \\"state's strategic equity\\". Place branding is \\"the totality of the thoughts, feelings, associations and expectations that come to mind when a prospect or consumer is exposed to an entity's name, logo, products, services, events, or any design or symbol representing them.\\" Place branding is required to make a country's image acceptable for investment, tourism, political power, etc. As Joseph Nye commented, \\"in an information age, it is often the side which has the better side of the story that wins,\\" this has resulted in a shift from old style diplomacy to encompass brand building and reputation management. In short, a country can use its culture to create a brand for itself which represents positive values and image.Peter Van Ham, \\"Place Branding: The State of the Art,\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 616 (March 2008): 127-133, doi:10.1177/0002716207312274.  Complications  Cultural diplomacy presents a number of unique challenges to any government attempting to carry out cultural diplomacy programs. Most ideas that a foreign population observes are not in the government's control. The government does not usually produce the books, music, films, TV programs, consumer products, etc. that reaches an audience. The most the government can do is try to work to create openings so the message can get through to mass audiences abroad.Mark Leonard, \\"Diplomacy by Other Means,\\" Foreign Policy 132 (September/October 2002): 50. To be cultural relevant in the age of globalization, a government must exercise control over the flows of information and communication technologies, including trade.Louis Belanger, \\"Redefining Cultural Diplomacy: Cultural Security and Foreign Policy in Canada,\\" Political Psychology 20, no. 4 (December 1999): 677-8, doi:10.1111/0162-895X.00164. This is also difficult for governments that operate in a free market society where the government does not control the bulk of information flows. What the government can do is work to protect cultural exports where they flourish, by utilizing trade agreements or gaining access for foreign telecommunication networks.Louis Belanger, \\"Redefining Cultural Diplomacy: Cultural Security and Foreign Policy in Canada,\\" Political Psychology 20, no. 4 (December 1999): 678, doi:10.1111/0162-895X.00164. It is also possible that foreign government officials may oppose or resist certain cultural exports while the people cheer them on. This can make support for official policies difficult to obtain.Joseph S. Nye, Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics (Cambridge: Perseus Books, 2004), 56. Cultural activities may be both a blessing and a curse to a nation. This may be the case if certain elements of a culture are offensive to the foreign audience. Certain cultural activities can also undermine national policy objectives. An example of this was the very public American dissent to the Iraq War while official government policy still supported it. Simultaneously the prevalence of the protest may have attracted some foreigners to the openness of America. The success of cultural diplomacy is also difficult to measure.

He was born in Brest-Litovsk (in modern Belarus), to Jewish parents, lived in Rostov as a child, and immigrated to the United States at an early age with his father. Following work at a tobacco factory in the United States, and time spent making cigarettes by hand, he invented a cigarette-making machine. From 1890 to 1895 he was managing director of the National Cigarette Tobacco Company of New York, which he had set up with the backing of a group of financiers to challenge the powerful tobacco trusts. In 1895 he visited England to sell the patent rights to his cigarette machine. However, he was attracted by the commercial opportunities and moved to England, where he established the Baron Cigarette Machine Company Limited in Aldgate, London. The patent was later sold to the United Cigarette Machine Company for £120,000. He expanded into the production of cigarettes and tobacco and in 1903 he joined the board of the Carreras Tobacco Company, becoming its managing director in 1904 and chairman in 1905. He retained these posts until his death. Following his business success he engaged in philanthropy, focusing on hospitals and hospital patients, including the creation of a trust. Amongst the projects supported by the trust was a cradle- to-grave school in the East End of London, originally established as the St George's Jewish Settlement and run by Basil Henriques and Rose Henriques. With a capacity of over 1,000 pupils it provided everything from kindergarten to adult literacy classes. The school building at 71 Henriques Street in Shadwell is now named Bernhard Baron House and has been converted to flats. While living in the US he married Rachel Schwartz of Washington, who died in 1920. They had three daughters and one son. His son Louis succeeded him as chairman of Carreras and was created a baronet in 1930. Bernhard Baron died at Brighton in 1920, and his estate was valued at £5 million.

Named after the head of the committee, Peter Hartz, these recommendations went on to become part of the German government's Agenda 2010 series of reforms, known as Hartz I – Hartz IV. The committee devised thirteen \\"innovation modules\\", which recommended changes to the German labour market system. These were then gradually put into practice: The measures of Hartz I – III were undertaken between January 1, 2003, and 2004, while Hartz IV was implemented on January 1, 2005. The \\"Hartz Committee\\" was founded on February 22, 2002, by the federal government of Germany led then by Gerhard Schröder. Its official name was Kommission für moderne Dienstleistungen am Arbeitsmarkt (Committee for Modern Services in the Labour Market). The 15-member committee was chaired by Peter Hartz, then Volkswagen's personnel director. Hartz I, II, and III Hartz I and II both came into effect on January 1, 2003, aiming at making new types of jobs easier to create, and covered, for example: _Hartz I_ *The foundation of \\"Staff Services agencies\\" (Personal-Service-Agenturen or PSAs). *Support for vocational further education from the German Federal Labour Agency. *Subsistence payments by the Federal Labour Agency. _Hartz II_ *New types of employment, Mini job and Midi job, with lower or gradually rising taxes and insurance payments. *A grant for entrepreneurs, known as the \\"Ich-AG\\" (Me, Inc.). *Introduction of Jobcenters, local government facilities for providing public employment services _Hartz III_ *Hartz III came into effect on January 1, 2004. This measure was aimed at restructuring and reforming the federal public employment services agency, whose name was changed from the Bundesanstalt für Arbeit or Arbeitsamt (Federal Labour Institution), to the Bundesagentur für Arbeit or Agentur für Arbeit (Federal Labour Agency). Hartz IV The fourth stage of the reform was voted in by the Bundestag on December 16, 2003 and by the Bundesrat on July 9, 2004, to take effect by January 1, 2005. This part of the reforms brought together the former unemployment benefits for long-term unemployed ('Arbeitslosenhilfe') and the welfare benefits ('Sozialhilfe'), leaving them both at approximately the lower level of the former Sozialhilfe (social assistance). The level for a single person was €374 per month (known as the Regelsatz). This was subsequently raised to €391 per month, in 2013. \\"Regierung will Arbeitslosengeld II-Regelsatz erhöhen\\" (Government to expand unemployment benefits rules), Focus (13 September 2012). Retrieved 02.08.2016. Added to this is the financial assistance with housing and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner plus their children. Prior to 2005, between 12 and 36 months (depending upon the claimant's age and work history) of their full unemployment benefit (60 to 67% of the previous net salary) were followed by the Arbeitslosenhilfe (unemployment assistance), amounting to 53 to 57% of the last net salary. Since 2008, eligibility for the full unemployment benefit (renamed Arbeitslosengeld in 2005 and commonly referred to as Arbeitslosengeld I in everyday German to contrast it with the lower benefits discussed below) has been restricted to 12 months in general, 15 months for those aged 50 or older, 18 months for those 55 or older and 24 months for those 58 or older. This is now followed by the (usually much lower) Arbeitslosengeld II (Hartz IV) benefits if the claimant meets eligibility requirements. Whether or not a claimant is eligible for Arbeitslosengeld II depends on his or her savings, life insurance and the income of spouse or partner. If these assets are below a threshold level, a claimant can get money from the state. The threshold level in July 2008 was €150 for free assets (at least €3,100) and €250 for fixed retirement assets, both calculated per capita and lifetime year.Text of Social Code (SGB) Second Book (II) – basic security for job seekers – (Article 1 of the Law of 24 December 2003, Federal Law Gazette I p 2954) (in German) Additionally, every employable individual in a communal household (persons living in and depending on the resources of the claimant), can have one car worth about €7,500 and a self-used house of 130 square meters living space (more if there are other people in the common household). To receive payments, a claimant must agree to a contract subject to public law. This contract outlines what they are obliged to do to improve their job situation, and when the state is obliged to help. An unemployed person may be required to accept any kind of legal job. This compulsion is restricted by constitutional rights, like freedom of movement, freedom of family, marriage and human dignity. If taking on a specific placement is deemed reasonable by the responsible agency, not applying will result in a reduction or even complete suspension of the appropriate payment. Within the Arbeitslosengeld II schemes, the state covers the health insurance of the unemployed. Until the end of 2010, payments towards the pension scheme of the claimant were also made. It is possible to earn income from a job and receive Arbeitslosengeld II benefits at the same time. Job income is debited from Arbeitslosengeld II payments according to a formula that leaves a certain amount of the additional revenue untouched. These revenues are: a certain amount of savings (which increases with age); €100 plus 20 percent of the wage up to €800 plus 10% of the wage up to €1200 (up to €1500 if there are children). Through this mechanism Arbeitslosengeld II can be regarded as a sort of minimum wage floor for employees without assets, where the minimum wage is not fully paid by the employer but assured by the state. There are criticisms that this defies competition and leads to a downward spiral in wages and the loss of full-time jobs. The Hartz IV reform merged the federal level unemployment agency with the local level welfare administration. This facilitated a better, case-oriented approach to helping unemployed people find work and improve their situations. The plan's objective is to reduce caseloads from 400 unemployed persons per agent to not more than 75 (aged 25 or less), or not more than 150 persons over the age of 25. For difficult cases, dedicated case managers may be deployed. Legally, however, the agencies remain separate. The Hartz IV reforms continue to attract criticism in Germany, despite a considerable reduction in short- and long-term unemployment. This reduction has led to some claims of success for the Hartz reforms. Others say the actual unemployment figures are not comparable because many people work part-time or are not included in the statistics for other reasons, such as the number of children that live in Hartz IV households, which has risen to record numbers. About 7 million people get Hartz IV benefits, of which 2.2 million are unemployed. \\"Combien coûte le RSA ?\\", Observatoire des Gaspillages (02.06.2014). Retrieved 02.08.2016. The budget is estimated to be 20 bn euro. \\"Hartz IV Kostensteigerung: Medienfalschberichte\\", www.gegen-hartz.de (06.10.2014). Retrieved 02.08.2016. The Hartz IV reforms formed one of the main foundations of Germany’s subsequent economic boom. In April 2018, 55% of the recipients had a migration background. According to the Federal Employment Agency (German: Bundesagentur für Arbeit) this was due to the migrants lacking either employable skills or knowledge of the language. In a November 2019 ruling the Federal Constitutional Court prohibited controversial harsh sanctions against benefit recipients. It outlawed complete payment cuts and decided that 30-percent cuts would only be permissible under specific conditions, as such punishments endangered jobseekers' minimum standard of living. Cultural impact Although the official term for long- term unemployment benefits is still Arbeitslosengeld II, most Germans, even news programmes and politicians in parliament, refer to it as Hartz IV. The term was voted German Word of the Year 2004 by the Society for the German Language. \\"Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!\\", (One year, one (non-)word), Spiegel Online (31.10.2011). Retrieved 02.08.2016. Earlier, in 2002, the term Ich-AG (another Hartz measure, see above) had been chosen as the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars. Meanwhile, Hartz IV has become a synonym for the class of non-working poor and is used as a prefix in multiple contexts (e.g. low-brow daytime television programmes are called \\"Hartz IV TV\\" by critics).

It seeks to mirror an actual production environment as closely as possible and may connect to other production services and data, such as databases. In military usage, a staging area is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed. The US Department of Defense uses these definitions: Often and historically this military staging area has been termed a point d'appui, which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument, as in the case of Catto Long Barrow in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Unlike normal bases, the facilities of a staging area are temporary, mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime. Militaries use staging areas to deploy military units, aircraft and warships and materiel ahead of an attack or invasion. In former times, this used to be generally the border area of one's own country, but in recent wars (Gulf War, Kosovo War, Iraq War) it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access.

His first novel, Futility (1922), drew on his experiences of fighting the Bolsheviks in pre- revolutionary Russia. William Gerhardie by Norman Ivor Lancashire (1927–2004). Photograph by Stella Harpley Life and career Gerhardie (or Gerhardi – he added the \\"e\\" in later years) was born at St Petersburg, Russia, the fifth of six children of Charles Alfred Gerhardi (1864–1925), a British expatriate industrialist, and his wife Clara Annie (1869–1948), daughter of John Wadsworth. He was educated at the Sankt Annenschule and Reformierte Schule in St Petersburg, before completing his education in England at Worcester College, Oxford.Article by Michael Holroyd. In 1915, during the First World War he enlisted in the Royal Scots Greys and trained in England while applying for a commission as an officer. After commissioning in 1916 he was posted to the staff of the British Military Attaché at Petrograd (as his birth city was then renamed) until 1918. During that period he witnessed the development of the 1917 Revolution which ruined his father who escaped Russia to exile in England having been allowed out through being identified with the (already dead) British socialist Keir Hardie. During the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War following the revolution he was attached to the 3rd Battalion of the Scots Guards and served on the British Military Mission to the White Russian forces in Siberia. He was demobilised with the rank of Captain in 1920, having been mentioned in despatches, appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and awarded the Imperial Russian Order of St Stanislaus and the Czechoslovak War Cross. Gerhardie was one of the most critically acclaimed English novelists of the 1920s (Evelyn Waugh told him, \\"I have talent, but you have genius.\\") H. G. Wells also championed his work. His first novel, Futility, was written while he was at Worcester College, Oxford and drew on his experiences in Russia fighting (or attempting to fight) the Bolsheviks, along with his childhood experiences visiting pre-revolutionary Russia. Some say that it was the first work in English to explore fully the theme of \\"waiting\\", later made famous by Samuel Beckett in Waiting for Godot, but it is probably more apt to recognize a common comic nihilism between those two figures. His next novel, The Polyglots, is probably his masterpiece (although some argue for Doom). Again it deals with Russia (Gerhardie was strongly influenced by the tragi-comic style of Russian writers such as Anton Chekhov, about whom he wrote a study while in college). He collaborated with Hugh Kingsmill on the biography The Casanova Fable, his friendship with Kingsmill being both a source of conflict over women and a great intellectual stimulus. In the Second World War, Gerhardie served in the Officers Emergency Reserve and from 1942 to 1945 he worked with the BBC in its European Division, where he was first editor of the \\"English by Radio\\" language programme. After that war Gerhardie's star waned, and he became unfashionable. Although he continued to write, he published no new work after 1939. After a period of poverty-stricken oblivion, he lived to see two \\"definitive collected works\\" published by Macdonald in 1947–49, revised in 1970–74 with prefaces by Michael Holroyd who consistently championed his work. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975. An idiosyncratic study of world history between 1890 and 1940 (God's Fifth Column) was discovered among his papers and published posthumously. More recently, both Prion and New Directions Press have been reissuing his works. Gerhardie lived the last 37 years of his life in the West End of London in increasing seclusion. He died at the Middlesex Hospital in June 1977 aged 81. After cremation his ashes were scattered in Regent's Park in a gathering including writers Olivia Manning and J. G. Farrell. Asked how to say his name, he told the Literary Digest \\"Pronounced jer (as Ger in Gerald) hardy, with the accent on the a: jer-har'dy. This is the way I and my relatives pronounce it, though I am told it is incorrect. Philologists are of the opinion that it should be pronounced with the g as in Gertrude. I believe they are right. I, however, cling to the family habit of mispronouncing it. But I do so without obstinacy. If the world made it worth my while I would side with the multitude.\\" Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk and Wagnalls, 1936. The contemporary British novelist William Boyd has identified Gerhardie, along with Cyril Connolly, as key inspirations for the central character (the writer Logan Mountstuart) in his 2002 novel Any Human Heart.Bookbrowse .

In its mission statement, it describes itself as \\"a diverse and democratic community of activists inspired by Jewish tradition to work together for peace, social justice, and human rights [to] support the aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians for security and self-determination\\" and says it \\"seeks an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem\\". Its critics say it musters Jewish opposition to and works to undermine public support for Israel.\\"Profile: 'Jewish Voice for Peace, Anti-Defamation League, November 18, 2014. Founding, staff, and advisory board JVP was formed in September 1996. Stefanie Fox is the executive director; as of 2016, there were 27 other staff members. Members of the advisory board include Tony Kushner, Sarah Schulman, Judith Butler, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, and Wallace Shawn. Positions JVP opposes the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and criticizes what it describes as the \\"severe human-rights violations that Israel engages in every day.\\" It \\"endorses neither a one-state solution to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nor a two-state solution\\". JVP supports the Palestinian right of return while opposing the Law of Return and the Birthright Israel movement. The organization also supports the boycott against Israel through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS). Activities =Blogs= In 2004, JVP published a collection of essays entitled Reframing Anti-Semitism: Alternative Jewish Perspectives. Among the topics it discussed were antisemitism and stereotypes of Jews in modern America. It argued that the Jewish left and critics of Israeli policy had ceded the fight against antisemitism to the Jewish right, and that critics of Israel or Israeli policies should not be accused of antisemitism. In 2007, JVP launched MuzzleWatch, a blog dedicated to tracking and exposing allegations of what it considers intimidation and suppression of voices critical of certain Israeli policies. In February 2010, JVP launched The Only Democracy?, a blog that says it \\"questions the very notion of Israel as 'the only democracy in the Middle East', and puts a spotlight on the intensifying struggle for human rights largely ignored by the mainstream media\\". = BDS avocacy = According to its website, JVP supports \\"divestment from and boycotts of companies that profit from Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. ... The boycott/divestment/sanctions movement (BDS) encompasses a variety of tactics and targets. JVP rejects the assertion that BDS is inherently anti-Semitic, and we encourage discussion both within our own community and outside of it of the growing BDS movement.\\"Daniel Koren \\"UJA Federation distances itself from Tony Kushner event\\", Canadian Jewish News March 22, 2016. JVP justifies its support for the movement by arguing that BDS provides a vehicle allowing individuals all over the world in the Jewish diaspora to bring about real change by threatening in their consumer choices to lower the profits of any business that by their activities reinforces Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.Yehuda Magid, \\"The Jewish American peace camp: New Expressions of the Jewish diaspora\\", in Galia Golan, Walid Salem, (eds.), Non- State Actors in the Middle East: Factors for Peace and Democracy, Routledge, 2013 p.159. Gal Beckerman of The Forward wrote that it \\"is a group that has demonstrated a guerilla-like savvy in staging actions that get its message out to a broader national audience. In its use of BDS, for example, JVP has staked out a position distinct from those who target any and all entities related to Israel, which for many Jews implies a rejection of Israel's very legitimacy. JVP instead targets only entities involved in one way or another with Israel's occupation of the West Bank.\\" JVP's executive director Rebecca Vilkomerson stated: \\"We do feel connected to the global BDS movement. We consider ourselves a part of it.\\" During 2004 and 2005, JVP protested against Caterpillar Inc. for selling bulldozers to Israel, and said that Israel's use of the D9 armoured bulldozers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a violation of human rights and Caterpillar's business code of conduct. Along with four Christian groups, JVP introduced a shareholder resolution calling on Caterpillar to re-examine its sales of bulldozers to Israel. The resolution was rejected by 97 percent of the votes at the Caterpillar 2005 shareholders' meeting. JVP continued to introduce shareholder resolutions at Caterpillar shareholder meetings every year since 2005. In 2010 the resolution received 20% of the vote. In June 2010, JVP launched a divestment campaign against the pension fund TIAA-CREF. The petition to divest reads, \\"We are participants and investors in TIAA-CREF funds who are deeply concerned that TIAA-CREF invests in many companies that profit from Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Some of these companies provide weapons and covert surveillance supplies that maintain the occupation by force. Others take or exploit Palestinian resources, including scarce water and even the land itself. All are profiting from Israel's violations of international law and international human rights standards.\\" The five companies targeted by the campaign are Caterpillar, Elbit, Veolia, Motorola, and Northrop Grumman. In September 2010, Israeli artists came to JVP asking for U.S. support to an artistic boycott of the theater in the city of Ariel, in the Israeli-occupied territories. JVP drafted a statement that was signed by over 150 theater and film professionals. On the significance of the action, JVP said that it \\"was the first time such mainstream figures had drawn a line around normalizing settlements which are illegal according to international law, and which constitute one of the main impediments to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians\\". In June 2014, when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) voted to divest its stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions to protest \\"the companies' profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and pressure Israel to withdraw\\", JVP members attended the church's convention and supported the divestment measure. Rabbi Alissa Wise, a JVP co-director of organizing, told the Presbyterians that to her, divestment \\"helps Palestinians build their power. So that Israel is convinced, not by force, but by global consensus that something has to change.\\" On February 20, 2015, JVP published a statement moving from its former position of supporting selective divestment, to a full endorsement of the call from Palestinian civil society for boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel until the Israeli government respects the rights of Palestinians. Explaining the change in position, JVP wrote in 2015: =Demonstrations= In 2006, JVP helped organize a demonstration outside a meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Sacramento, California. The stated purpose of the protest was to argue that AIPAC does not represent the views of all American Jews regarding Israel. As part of a coalition of over 100 organizations, JVP participated in the 2011 Move Over AIPAC conference. On February 25, 2007, JVP was one of twelve groups that sponsored a demonstration in Teaneck, New Jersey, against the sale of homes in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The organizations said that in the past, such homes were \\"sold exclusively to Jewish people\\" and that Palestinians were not allowed to buy them \\"because of their religion and their ethnicity\\". The groups said that the home sale, which took place at Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, might violate international law and New Jersey laws against discriminatory sales practices. The JVP position on the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict was that Israel's actions were \\"an opportunistic agenda for short-term political gain at an immense cost in Palestinian lives\\" which are \\"illegal and immoral and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms\\". JVP joined marches and demonstrations condemning Israel in many cities, including Racine, Wisconsin, and Seattle. The Young Jewish Declaration is a project created by young JVP leaders. Young Jewish and Proud debuted at the 2010 Jewish General Assembly when five of its members disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech. Reception JVP has come under criticism from other Jewish groups that have branded the movement not only as anti-Semitic but also traitorous. For Dov Waxman, the anger which JVP's actions and positions arouse in many other American Jewish groups is just one index of a broader polarizing controversy within the Jewish American community at large, whose leaders had hitherto managed to shut out internal disagreements from the public purview.Dov Waxman, Trouble in the Tribe: The American Jewish Conflict over Israel, Princeton University Press, 2016 p.2. The Anti-Defamation League criticized JVP for what it described as \\"anti-Israel radicalism\\" and \\"questionable tactics\\" to promote its agenda, describing a 2017 video campaign as \\"veering dangerously close to repeating anti-Semitic slurs\\".ADL Slams pro-BDS Jewish Group’s 'anti-Semitic' New Video Campaign, Haaretz, Judy Maltz, July 21, 2017 The Jewish Bulletin of Northern California wrote in 2003 that \\"the mainstream Jewish community\\" viewed \\"Jewish Voice for Peace as a group of radical Jews who air dirty laundry by criticizing Israel when the Jewish state is under attack. Some go as far as to label the members self-hating Jews.\\" On January 28, 2007, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) convened \\"Finding Our Voice\\", a conference co- sponsored by more than 50 Jewish organizations for the purpose of discussing the rise in antisemitism. Its co-sponsors represented a wide range of Jewish opinion, including the ADL and AIPAC on the right and Americans for Peace Now and the Jewish Labor Committee on the left. Tikkun and JVP were not invited to co-sponsor the conference. A spokesperson for JVP said, \\"From our perspective, you cannot get to the roots of anti-Semitism in the progressive movement without honestly addressing the severe human-rights violations that Israel engages in every day. Judging by the lineup, that kind of honest examination is not likely to happen at this conference.\\" In February 2007, Rabbi Ira Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis, wrote a column in The Forward about Jewish critics of Israel, and the way in which many Jews and Jewish organizations \\"squash\\" such dissent. In his column, Youdovin wrote that \\"the line separating calumny from legitimate dissent is unclear and ever shifting,\\" but he added that \\"Jewish Voice for Peace, which supports divestment and is currently circulating a petition urging Congress to heed Jimmy Carter's words, is certainly beyond the pale.\\" Mitchell Plitnick, director of education and policy for JVP, responded by calling Rabbi Youdovin's line \\"arbitrary\\" and saying that \\"Youdovin misrepresents JVP's position\\" concerning divestment. Plitnick emphasized that JVP supports \\"selective and targeted divestment that is aimed exclusively at the occupation, not at Israel itself\\". Plitnick wrote that \\"[m]ost Jews believe that there should be pressure on both Israelis and Palestinians to make peace\\" and that \\"JVP advocates nothing more or less than that.\\" Writing in The Jerusalem Post in 2008, Jon Haber described JVP as an organization that \\"exists largely to declare anyone accused of anti-Jewish bias 'not guilty' (with a Jewish accent)\\". In October 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) identified JVP as one of the top 10 anti-Israel groups in the United States In a September 2010 report, the ADL wrote: > While JVP's activists try to portray themselves as Jewish critics of Israel, > their ideology is nothing but a complete rejection of Israel. In May 2008, > for example, members of JVP protested many of the celebrations of Israel's > 60th anniversary that took place around the country, essentially > illustrating that they oppose Israel's very existence. The ADL also took issue with JVP's mission statement which it said \\"places the onus of resolving the conflict on Israel\\" and lists a long list of requirements for Israel. \\"In stark contrast to these detailed requirements, the only stipulation for Palestinians is the cessation of 'suicide bombings and other attacks on Israeli civilians, the report said.Jewish Voice for Peace September 27, 2010 JVP responded by saying the ADL was wrong about several key points—among them, that JVP is not anti-Israel or anti-Zionist. JVP also invited its supporters to make financial contributions to JVP in honor of Abraham Foxman, the leader of the ADL. In February 2011, The New York Times published a piece on JVP activism in the Bay Area that said, \\"The activists say they are not working against Israel, but against Israeli government policies they believe are discriminatory.\\" In an editor's note, the Times later wrote that one of the article's two authors was a pro-Palestinian advocate and he should not have been allowed to write it. In March 2011, Brandeis University's Hillel organization voted not to accept the membership bid of the local campus chapter of JVP, citing JVP's association with the larger Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS). The decision, said the group's e-board, was founded on Hillel International's guidelines for inclusion. Upon review of JVP's statement of mission, past and proposed events, Hillel leadership was quoted saying, \\"While we understand that JVP at Brandeis considers itself a pro-Israel club, based on positions and programming JVP has sponsored, we do not believe that JVP can be included under Hillel's umbrella.\\" In response, JVP formulated a petition in favor of its inclusion in the Hillel that over a third of the student body signed. Leonard Fein, wrote in regards to the tent of Jewish thought and opinion on March 31, 2011 in The Forward, \\"I remain quite uncomfortable with the notion that JVP should be barred from the communal tent.\\" In September 2011, Rabbi Doug Kahn, executive director of the San Francisco-based Jewish Community Relations Council, said: \\"Jewish Voice for Peace routinely allows itself to be used as political cover by organizations promoting anti-Israel boycotts and divestment so that they can claim that they have Jewish backing for their positions, even though JVP represents a tiny fraction of the community.\\" In response, Rabbi Alissa Wise, a national organizer for JVP who co-founded JVP's rabbinical council, speaking on behalf of the JVP, said \\"we're not responsible for the language used by others,\\" that some \\"groups do more harm than good\\" and that she regarded the work done by JVP as \\"trying to promote self- determination and equality for all people ... a fruition of Jewish values, the path of living a Jewish life\\". The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA) removed Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of JVP, and Cecilie Surasky, deputy director of JVP, from its Jewish Community Heroes competition because JVP \\"is a supporter of the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign targeting investment in Israel\\". Joe Berkofsky, JFNA managing director of communications added \\"our Israel Action Network is working to challenge the boycott, sanctions and divestment movement and other efforts to isolate and weaken the Jewish state. We cannot therefore support a group that seeks to harm Israel through its support for BDS.\\" In July 2013, j. published an article about a report on JVP from NGO Monitor. The article said that NGO Monitor's report \\"concludes that JVP has 'actively promoted the central dimensions of the political warfare strategy against Israel. The article quoted Yitzhak Santis, chief programs officer at NGO Monitor, as saying \\"the organization supports or has partnered with groups such as Sabeel, Electronic Intifada, Al-Awda, International ANSWER Coalition, the International Solidarity Movement and Students for Justice in Palestine, all of which label Israel a racist apartheid state, support BDS and, in some cases, support violence against Israelis.\\" In 2014, Mark LeVine wrote that \\"Israel's recent assault on Gaza\\" had helped increase JVP's membership. Beside the Gaza conflict, LeVine wrote, the rise of JVP was \\"part of a generational shift in the very fabric of Jewish identity\\", in which \\"a growing number of Jewish activists now subscribe to the kind of struggles for fundamental rights that defined Jewish American culture in the civil rights era\\". Nadia Hijab wrote about JVP's March 2015 National Membership Meeting in The Nation. She described JVP as a \\"key player\\" in a \\"fast-growing US movement for Palestinian human rights and equality between Palestinians and Israelis\\". She wrote that J Street is \\"larger and better-funded\\" but JVP \\"is proving to be a real magnet for American Jews who are outraged by Israel's policies and even more by [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's claim to be speaking in their name, and who want to take action\\". In 2016, JVP unreservedly endorsed the platform of the Movement for Black Lives (MFBL), which uses the word \\"genocide\\" to describe Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. When their endorsement came in for strong criticism from several Jewish organizations, JVP replied that it was not their job to police the wording the MFBL employs to articulate its viewpoint, and expressed disappointment at the other organizations for condemning the platform. Jews of Color Caucus, a group with JVP, stated: \\"we embrace rather than shut down the multiple uses of the term 'genocide' for what it can reveal about our current crises.\\" In 2017, JVP was criticized for inviting Rasmea Odeh, a former PFLP member convicted in the 1969 Jerusalem supermarket bombing that killed Israelis Edward Joffee and Leon Kanner, as a featured speaker in its biennial conference.Jewish Voice for Peace to host convicted terrorist at confab, Times of Israel, Josefin Dolsten, March 22, 2017JVP Plan To Feature Convicted Terrorist As Speaker Upended By Deportation Agreement, Forward, Aimee Levitt, March 22, 2017Jewish Voice for Peace to Host Terrorist at Panel, JPost, Danielle Ziri, February 27, 2017 Odeh was subsequently deported from the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and losing her American citizenship.Terrorist who killed two in Jerusalem bombing deported from United States, The Jewish Chronicle, Daniel Sugarman, September 19, 2017 In June 2017, JVP received sharp criticism from Jewish progressives and members of the LGBTQ community after some of its members disrupted New York's Celebrate Israel Parade, garnering accusations from Jewish Queer Youth (JQY), an organization for Jewish LGBTQ teenagers mainly from Orthodox communities, that the JVP action constituted \\"an act of homophobia\\". JVP Deputy Director Alissa Wise called the backlash against its action \\"opportunistically cruel\\" and said responses to it relied on \\"tired, homophobic memes\\" and were \\"hyperbolic in the extreme\\". Later that month, JVP issued a statement that supported the expulsion from the Chicago Dyke March of marchers who carried rainbow flags that included a Star of David, which march organizers said \\"made people feel unsafe\\". In July 2017, the Anti-Defamation League criticized JVP for what it described as \\"anti-Israel radicalism\\" and \\"questionable tactics\\" to promote its agenda.

Life He was born in Jamaica where his father, William Garland Barrett, who was an amateur naturalist, Congregationalist minister and a member of the London Missionary Society, ran a station for saving African slaves.Institution of Electrical Engineers. Sir William Fletcher Barrett (1844-1925), Professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal College of Science, Dublin. 1925 Proceedings. Vol. 63. 1925. Institution of Electrical Engineers: Obituaries. There he lived with his mother, Martha Barrett, née Fletcher, and a brother and sister. The family returned to their native England in Royston, Hertfordshire in 1848 where another sister, the social reformer Rosa Mary Barrett was born. In 1855 they moved to Manchester and Barrett was then educated at Old Trafford Grammar School.Gauld, Alan. (2004). Barrett, Sir William Fletcher (1844–1925). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. accessed 2 Feb 2011. Barrett then took chemistry and physics at the Royal College of Chemistry and then became the science master at the London International College (1867–9) before becoming assistant to John Tyndall at the Royal Institution (1863–1866). He then taught at the Royal School of Naval Architecture. In 1873 he became Professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal College of Science for Ireland. From the early 1880s he lived with his mother, sister, and two live-in servants in a residence at Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). Barrett discovered Stalloy (see Permalloy), a silicon-iron alloy used in electrical engineering and also did a lot of work on sensitive flames and their uses in acoustic demonstrations. During his studies of metals and their properties, Barrett worked with W. Brown and R. A. Hadfield. He also discovered the shortening of nickel through magnetisation in 1882. When Barrett developed cataracts in his later years, he also began to study biology with a series of experiments designed to locate and successfully analyze causative agents within the eyes. The result of these experiments was a machine called the entoptiscope. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1899 and was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Dublin Society. He was knighted in 1912. He married Florence Willey in 1916. He died at home, 31 Devonshire Place in London. Barrett's last book, Christian Science: An Examination of the Religion of Health was completed and published after his death in 1926 by his sister Rosa M. Barrett. Psychical research Barrett Barrett became interested in the paranormal in the 1860s after having an experience with mesmerism. Barrett believed that he had been witness to thought transference and by the 1870s he was investigating poltergeists. In September 1876 Barrett published a paper outlining the result of these investigations and by 1881 he had published preliminary accounts of his additional experiments with thought transference in the journal Nature. The publication caused controversy and in the wake of this Barrett decided to found a society of like-minded individuals to help further his research. Barrett held conference between 5–6 January 1882 in London. In February the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was formed.Oppenheim, Janet. (1985). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. pp. 137-372. Barrett was a Christian and spiritualist member of the SPR. Although he had founded the society, Barrett was only truly active for a year, and in 1884 founded the American Society for Psychical Research. He became president of the society in 1904 and continued to submit articles to their journal. From 1908–14 Barrett was active in the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research, a group which attracted many important members including Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, T.W. Rolleston, Sir Archibald Geikie, and Lady Augusta Gregory.McCorristine, Shane. (2011). William Fletcher Barrett, Spiritualism, and Psychical Research in Edwardian Dublin. Estudios Irlandeses. Journal of Irish Studies 6: 39-53. In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by Barrett and other members of the SPR who believed them to have genuine psychic ability, however, the sisters later confessed to fraud by describing their method of signal codes that they had utilized.Hyman, Ray. (1989). The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research. Prometheus Books. pp. 99-106. Barrett and the other members of the SPR such as Edmund Gurney and Frederic W. H. Myers had been easily duped.Wiley, Barry H. (2012). The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary. McFarland. pp. 82-94. As a believer in telepathy, Barrett denounced the muscle reading of Stuart Cumberland and other magicians as \\"pseudo\\" thought readers.Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell. (2004). The Victorian Supernatural. Cambridge University Press. pp. 87-108. Barrett helped to publish Frederick Bligh Bond's book Gate of Remembrance (1918) which was based on alleged psychical excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. Barrett endorsed the claims of the book and testified to Bond's sincerity.Asprem, Egil. (2014). The Problem of Disenchantment: Scientific Naturalism and Esoteric Discourse, 1900-1939. Brill Academic Publishers. p. 330. However, professional archaeologists and skeptics have found Bond's claims dubious.Nickell, Joe. (2007). Adventures in Paranormal Investigation. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 48-49. Feder, Kenneth. Archaeology and the Paranormal. In Gordon Stein. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 32-43. In 1919, Barrett wrote the introduction to medium Hester Dowden's book Voices from the Void. Dowsing Barrett held a special interest in divining rods and in 1897 and 1900 he published two articles on the subject in Proceedings of the SPR. He co-authored the book The Divining-Rod (1926), with Theodore Besterman.Mill, Hugh Robert. (1927). Behind the Divining Rod. Nature 119: 310-311. Barrett rejected any physical theory for dowsing such as radiation. He concluded that the ideomotor response was responsible for the movement of the rod but in some cases the dowser's unconscious could pick up information by clairvoyance.Gardner, Martin. (2012 reprint edition). Originally published in 1957. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. Dover Publications. pp. 102-103. \\"The first significant \\"scientific\\" study of the subject was made in 1891 by Sir William F. Barrett, professor of physics at the Royal College of Science, Ireland. The Dowsing Rod, by Barrett and Theodore Besterman, published in 1926, is one of the leading references on the subject. The book's thesis is that the turning of the rod is due to unconscious muscular action on the part of the dowser, who possesses a clairvoyant ability to sense the presence of water.\\"Stein, Gordon. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 231. \\"Barrett, who believed in telepathy, acknowledged that the dowser's unconscious moving of the rod could be the result of autosuggestion stimulated by cues from the environment. He felt that in some cases, however, the diviner's unconscious was picking up information about the underground water through clairvoyance.\\" Reception Barrett has drawn criticism from researchers and skeptics as being overly credulous for endorsing spiritualist mediums and not detecting trickery that occurred in the séance room. For example, author Ronald Pearsall wrote that Barrett was duped into believing spiritualism by mediumship trickery.Pearsall, Ronald. (1972). The Table- Rappers. Book Club Associates. p. 219 Skeptic Edward Clodd criticized Barrett as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition.Clodd, Edward. (1917). The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism. Grant Richards, London. pp. 265-301 Another skeptic Joseph McCabe wrote that Barrett \\"talks nonsense of which he ought to be ashamed\\" as he had poor understanding of conjuring tricks and failed to detect the fraud of the medium Kathleen Goligher.McCabe, Joseph. (1920). Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined. London: Watts & Co. pp. 59-60 Psychical researcher Helen de G. Verrall gave Barrett's book Psychical Research a positive review describing it as a \\"clear, careful account of some of main achievements of psychical research by one who has himself taken part in these achievements and speaks to a large extent from personal knowledge and observation.\\"Verrall, Helen de G. (1913). Psychical Research by W. F. Barrett. International Journal of Ethics. Volume 23, No 2. pp. 239-240.

It has a length of approximately 150 kilometers. The area of the escarpment is inhabited today by the Dogon people. Before the Dogon, the escarpment was inhabited by the Tellem and Toloy peoples. Many structures remain from the Tellem. The Bandiagara Escarpment was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1989. The Cliffs of Bandiagara are a sandstone chain ranging from south to northeast over 200 km and extending to the Grandamia massif. The end of the massif is marked by the Hombori Tondo, Mali's highest peak at 1,155 meters. Because of its archaeological, ethnological and geological characteristics, the entire site is one of the most imposing in West Africa. History The cave-dwelling Tellem, an ethnic group later pushed out by the arrival of the Dogons, used to live in the slopes of the cliff. The Tellem legacy is evident in the caves they carved into the cliffs so that they could bury their dead high up, far from the frequent flash floods of the area. Dozens of villages are located along the cliff, such as Kani Bonzon. It was near this village that the Dogons arrived in the 14th century, and from there they spread over the plateau, the escarpment and the plains of the Seno-Gondo. According to local oral history, the Dogon were relatively undisturbed by French colonial powers due to natural tunnels weaving through the Bandiagara Escarpment. Only the Dogon knew of the tunnels, and were able to use them to ambush and repel aggressors. The Bandiagara Escarpment today Today, local guides escort tourist groups along the escarpment to visit Dogon villages. A series of trails runs along the cliffs, and hostels in each village provide food and lodging. The host villages receive income from the hostels and the tourist tax. Large increases in tourism to the area are expected, as a new highway is constructed, putting pressure on local, traditional cultures. In addition, The Independent reports that looting of ancient artifacts is widespread in the area, which is poorly policed. To call attention to the issue of uncontrolled tourist visitation, the World Monuments Fund included the Bandiagara Escarpment in the 2004 World Monuments Watch. In 2005, WMF provided a grant from American Express to the Mission Culturelle de Bandiagara for the development of a management plan.World Monuments Fund - Bandiagara Escarpment Cultural Landscape Beyond the protection of traditional buildings, the management plan calls for the regulation of new construction through the establishment of strict building guidelines, such as those that govern new development in historic districts around the world. After the 2012 war in Mali, central areas of the country, including the Dogon Plateau and Bandiagara Escarpment, have become increasingly dangerous. Terrorist groups operate in the area, and violence between local ethnicities occurs on a daily basis. As of 2018 it is extremely inadvisable to travel to this area for tourism, and Malian security forces have been known to turn back those who attempt to do so. In March, 2018 an armed group attacked a hotel frequented by UN staff in the town of Bandiagara killing several people.https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/692312/mali-hotel-shooting- hotel-la-falaise-in-bandiagara-islamist-attack  Gallery  See also *Bandiagara References  External links  * UNESCO - Cliff of Bandiagara (Land of the Dogons) * Thierry Joffroy and Lassana Cissé, \\"Culture at a Crossroads: For Mali’s Bandiagara Escarpment, extraordinary geology and human genius have conspired to create one of the world’s great cultural landscapes.

It is on the R581 regional road east of the N20 road, which runs from Limerick to Cork. It is about north of Mallow town. It is on the River Awbeg, a branch of the Blackwater. Doneraile is part of the Cork East Dáil constituency.  Name  The town is a small village sitting on the northern slope of Knockacur hill, which rises by a gentle slope from the Awbeg river and gradually ascends to a rocky prominence. However, it was not this rocky prominence but one near the graveyard of Oldcourt which together with an ancient fort built thereon, gave the town its name, Doneraile, i.e. \\"Dún ar Aill\\", meaning \\"the fort on the cliff\\".Doneraile by J. Anthony Gaughan, Kamac 1970  History  The horse race known as the steeplechase originated in 1752 as a result of a race between the church steeples of the town and neighbouring Buttevant town. There are only a few reported cases of women becoming Freemasons but one exception occurred in 18th century Doneraile. Elizabeth Aldworth, was reported to have surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile Court — the private house of her father, Arthur St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing.The Hon. Miss St. Leger and Freemasonry Ars Quatuor Coronatorum vol viii (1895) pp. 16-23, 53-6. vol. xviii (1905) pp. 46 In 1829 the shooting of a local doctor, John Norcott, led to rumours of a widespread conspiracy to murder local landlords, and on the word of an informer twenty- one local men were arrested and charged with the alleged crime. Most were fortunate enough to be defended by Daniel O'Connell, who secured the acquittal of the majority of them. The event came to known as the Doneraile Conspiracy. Doneraile also has the distinction of being the town in Ireland where the first successful agricultural co-operative and creamery was established in 1889 by Horace Plunkett. During the early part of May 1853, a countryman ploughing in the neighbourhood turned up a large quantity of silver coins, amounting to more than forty-six ounces in weight, which were purchased by a silversmith in Cork. They consisted of English shillings and sixpences of Elizabeth, with a few groats, threepences and half-groats of the same queen; also a few groats of her predecessors, Mary, and Philip and Mary both having the bust of Mary; English shillings and sixpences of James 1, upon the union with Scotland and exclusively of the rose, thistle, and fleur-de-lis mint marks; with a large number of the quarter-dollars and smaller money of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Nearly all the coins were in the finest state of preservation, and appeared to have been but little used or in circulation. Doneraile also achieved note in 1954 when a British journalist, Honor Tracy, condemned the local priest Canon Maurice O'Connell for spending the then exorbitant amount of £9000 on his parochial house while there was so much poverty in the village. Following The Sunday Times apology to O'Connell, Tracy sued it and was awarded £3000 in compensation. In response some 3000 of Doneraile's parishioners marched in the village in support of Canon O'Connell.In the Archives: April 12 1954, The Irish Times, April 12 2012 John B.

It usually includes a rotating helical screw blade called a 'flighting' to act as a screw conveyor to remove the drilled out material. The rotation of the blade causes the material to move out of the hole being drilled. Types Auger (drill), 1849 A skid-steer loader with an earth auger attachment. An auger used for digging post holes is called an earth auger, handheld power earth drill, soil auger, or mechanized post hole digger. This kind of auger can be a manually turned, handheld device, or powered by an electric motor or internal-combustion engine, possibly attached to a tractor (being provided with power by the tractor engine's power take-off as shown). Handheld augers can also be used for making holes for garden planting. Wood augers have a screw to pull them into the wood, as a gimlet has, and a cutting lip that slices out the bottom of the hole. The auger bit, meant to be used in a brace, also has cutting spurs to cut a clean circle deeper than where the lips scrape out the wood. In construction, augers are used for special drilling rigs to dig holes, or augerating for deep foundation piles. Another use is for piles forming a piling retaining wall, which can be constructed in the same way as foundation piles. Augers - either gas- or hand- powered - are used by ice fishermen to drill holes to fish through. Drilling into maple trees to extract maple syrup is also carried out with the use of augers.

The legislation initially provided federal health insurance for the elderly (over 65) and for poor families. History Many politicians were involved in drafting the final bill that was introduced to the United States Congress in March 1965. On July 30, 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill into law. The concept of national health insurance began in the early 20th century in the United States and then came to prominence during the Truman administration following World War II. Between 1958 and 1964, controversy grew and a bill was drafted. The signing of the act, as part of Johnson's Great Society, began an era with a greater emphasis on public health issues. Medicare and Medicaid became the United States' first public health insurance programs. The legislation was vigorously opposed by the American Medical Association until it had been enacted, following which the AMA cooperated in its implementation. In 1912 Theodore Roosevelt included social insurance for sickness in the platform of his Progressive Party (United States, 1912). Around 1915 the group American Association for Labor Legislation attempted to introduce a medical insurance bill to some state legislatures. These attempts were not successful, and as a result controversy about national insurance came about. National groups supporting the idea of government health insurance included the AFL-CIO, the American Nurses Association, National Association of Social Workers, and the Socialist Party USA. The most prominent opponent of national medical insurance was the American Medical Association (AMA); others included the American Hospital Association, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Life Insurance Association of People. =Previous administrations= In 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, medical benefits were left out of the bill. The committee that Roosevelt appointed to study issues related to Social Security wanted to include health insurance in the bill. However, the committee was concerned that amending the bill to include health insurance would kill the entire bill.LaTour, K. (2013). Health Information Management: Concepts, Principles, and Practice (4th ed). AHIMA Press. Retrieved from Harry Truman took on the idea of national medical care and tried to integrate it into his Fair Deal program. Truman's attempts were also unsuccessful, though during his presidency the fight for national medical care became specific to the aged population. Once the targeted age was decided, a lengthy debate began over presenting a coherent medical care bill to Congress. The Conservative coalition dominated the House Ways and Means Committee, which complicated attempts to pass social health programs. Wilbur Mills (D-AR), chair of the committee, later played a role in creating the health care program that was integrated into the Social Security Act. In 1960, the Kerr- Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged (MAA) program which gave states the power to decide which patients needed financial assistance. The federal government would provide matching funds to the states for the program. Some states did not participate or abide by the Act. Another preliminary bill, the King-Anderson Bill, was introduced in 1962. Under it, some hospital and nursing home costs for patients 65 and older would have been covered. Although this bill was defeated in committee, the vote was narrow (12–11), signaling a shift in attitudes. =Johnson administration= With the election of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Democrats controlled both the Presidency and the Congress, claiming a 2:1 ratio to Republicans in the House and 32 more seats in the Senate. The Democrats in the House Ways and Means Committee shifted away from Southern Democrats, making the committee more sympathetic towards health insurance reform. Those who had previously worked on the King-Anderson Bill drafted a new bill providing coverage of the aged, limited hospitalization and nursing home insurance benefits, and Social Security financing. Wilbur Cohen, Assistant Secretary for Legislation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (and later Secretary), pushed the Medicare bill. Cohen convinced Johnson to give the bill high priority, and Johnson declared its importance to his Great Society program. The bill was introduced as companion bills, H.R. 1 and S. 1, given the numbers as the first bill introduced in each House of the new Congress. = House of Representatives = The groups previously opposed to the legislation switched their focus from opposing the bill to creating new versions of it. As a result, three forms of the bill emerged: John Byrnes', the American Medical Association's, and the administration's bill (known as Medicare). Byrnes was a Republican committee member who proposed that doctors' services and drugs be financed; participation in coverage would be voluntary for the aged. If an elderly patient did need the help, his or her financing would be \\"scaled to the amounts of the participant's Social Security cash benefits\\" and the financing would come from the government's revenues. The AMA proposed Eldercare, which provided government financing for physician's services, surgical charges, drugs, nursing home costs, x-ray and lab services. When brought back to the Ways and Means committee, three bills were presented: Byrnes,' Eldercare, and Medicare. When deliberations began in 1965, both AMA members and their suggestions were rejected. Wilbur Mills, the chair of the Ways and Means committee, suggested combining Byrnes' ideas and Medicare. His committee took on the task of drafting H.R. 6675, the bill that ultimately became law. In combining the two bills, John Byrnes's suggestion, which included lower taxes, had to be altered as higher taxes were necessary for the program's predicted costs. The Ways and Means Committee reported favorably on the new bill to the full House of Representatives on March 29 after a straight party committee vote of 17 to 8. During debate on the House floor, Republicans offered a substitute bill that would have made participation fully voluntary. It was narrowly defeated 236 to 191, with 128 of 138 Republicans in favor of the substitute. H.R. 6675 was passed in the House on April 8, 1965 by a vote of 313 to 115. = Senate = The biggest threat to the passage of H.R. 6675 in the Senate came from liberal Democrats who were eager to expand coverage of the bill. As amended and passed in the Senate on July 19 by a vote of 68 to 2, H.R. 6675 would have cost approximately $800 million more than the House- passed bill. = Final passage = The bill went to conference committee where Representative Mills worked to eliminate practically all of the Senate amendments. The bill went through more than five hundred amendments before being passed by majority vote in the House (307–116) on July 27 and in the Senate on July 28 (70–24). The legislation made two amendments to the Social Security Act of 1935. Title XVIII, which became known as Medicare, includes Part A, which provides hospital insurance for the aged, and Part B, which provides supplementary medical insurance. Title XIX, which became known as Medicaid, provides for the states to finance health care for individuals who were at or close to the public assistance level with federal matching funds. On July 30, 1965, President Johnson signed the bill, making it Public Law 89-97. The signing took place in Independence, Missouri and was attended by Harry S. Truman. Johnson credited Truman with \\"planting the seeds of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick and serenity for the fearful\\". Implementation of the amendments required extensive data processing and the re-configuration of hospital policies nationwide.

The movement gained attention after an open letter signed by almost a thousand economics students at French universities and Grandes Écoles was published in Le Monde in 2000. Terminology The French term autisme has an older meaning and signifies \\"abnormal subjectivity, acceptance of fantasy rather than reality\\". However, post-autistic economists also \\"assert that neoclassical economics has the characteristics of an autistic child\\". The pejorative reference to the neurodevelopmental disorder autism is considered offensive by some economists. Greg Mankiw said that \\"use of the term indicates a lack of empathy and understanding for those who live with actual, severe autism\\". Response The French minister of education appointed a panel headed by Jean-Paul Fitoussi to inquire into economics teaching. In 2000, the panel called for limited reform. Articles associated with the movement were published in the Post-Autistic Economics Newsletter from September 2000. This electronic newsletter became the Post-Autistic Economics Review and, since 2008, has existed as the peer- reviewed journal Real-World Economics Review. Several responses to the French students' open letter were also published in Le Monde. A counter-petition signed by 15 French economists was published in October 2000. Robert Solow adhered to the \\"main thesis\\" of the French students' petition, but criticised the \\"opaque and almost incomprehensible\\" debate that followed among academics. Olivier Blanchard also published a response defending mainstream economics. Other notable economists, such as Steve Keen and James K. Galbraith, wrote elsewhere in support of the French students.

He was 33 years old, and a lance corporal in the 40th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 March 1918 at Ervillers, France, Lance-Corporal Cross volunteered to make a reconnaissance of the position of two machine-guns which had been captured by the enemy. With the agreement of his sergeant he crept back alone with only a service revolver to what had been his section's trench and was now the enemy's. He surprised seven soldiers who responded by throwing down their rifles. He then marched them carrying the machine guns complete with the tripods and ammunition to the British lines. He then handed over the prisoners and collected teams for his guns which he brought into action immediately, annihilating a very heavy attack by the enemy. The Victoria Cross was given for \\"extreme gallantry, initiative and dash\\". In June he was awarded the Military Medal for another act of bravery.

She is the title character's aristocratic cousin and love interest. At the beginning of the story, Candide is chased away from his uncle's home after he is caught kissing and fondling Cunégonde. Shortly afterwards, Cunégonde's family is attacked by a band of marauding soldiers and she is taken prisoner. However, Cunégonde soon becomes the mistress of two wealthy Portuguese who decide to share her between them. Candide kills the two men and he, Cunégonde and the Old Woman (Cunégonde's servant) flee to Buenos Aires. There, Cunégonde becomes the mistress of the provincial governor. Since Candide is wanted for the murders of the two Portuguese, he is forced to leave her in Buenos Aires. However he vows to find her and marry her. Finally, near the end of the novel, Candide finds Cunégonde in Istanbul, but she has lost her beauty, and is now very irritable and unfortunately very shallow-minded. Candide reluctantly agrees to marry her. Name ‘Cunégonde’ may be derived from Cunigunde of Luxemburg. However, the first part of the name may be intended as a pun, referring to the female genitalia (Latin: cunnus, French: con).Maledicta (1987) p. 31.Maurice Peress, Dvořák to Duke Ellington: A Conductor Explores America's Music and its African American Roots, Oxford / New York: Oxford University, 2004, , p. 141. Kunigunde, Kunigunda, or Cunigunde is a European female name of German origin derived from \\"kuni\\" (clan, family) and \\"gund\\" (war). In Polish this is sometimes Kunegunda or Kinga. Candide (operetta) In the 1956 operetta Candide written by Leonard Bernstein, Cunegonde is a soprano, who sings one of the most difficult arias written for the theatre: \\"Glitter and Be Gay\\". The role has been portrayed by skilled actresses such as Barbara Cook, who originated the role in 1956, Madeline Kahn, Kristin Chenoweth, June Anderson, Harolyn Blackwell, and Maureen Brennan, who received a Tony Award Nomination and won the Theatre World Award for her performance in the 1974 Broadway revival.

Phylogenetically, it is a sister clade to the guenons, but differs in dentition and habits. Allen's swamp monkey was named after American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen.  Range  Allen's swamp monkey lives in the Congo Basin, in the Republic of Congo and in the west of the DRC. It was recorded from Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve in the Central African Republic in 2016.  Description  This monkey is a rather strongly built animal. Its skin is grey-green at the top side. Its face is reddish with long hair bundles at the cheeks. The slight webbing of the fingers and toes point to its partially aquatic way of life. Allen's swamp monkey can reach a full body length from 45 to 60 cm, with a roughly 50-cm-long tail. Males, weighing up to 6 kg, are substantially larger than the females (up to 3.5 kg).  Behavior  Although still hunted for its meat, Allen's swamp monkey is increasingly seen as a household pet. (Photo taken in Basankusu, 2007) Allen's swamp monkey is a diurnal animal and regularly looks for food on the ground. It inhabits swampy, water-rich areas and can swim well, diving to avoid danger. It lives in social groups of up to 40 animals, communicating with different calls, gestures, and touches. Its diet consists of fruits and leaves, as well as beetles and worms. Little is known of the mating habits of this species. The females bear young, which are weaned around three months old and are mature after three to five years.

It sparked the franchise centered on the real-life dog Air Buddy, a cross-bred Golden Retriever, who shoots basketball hoops and appears as Buddy. The film was financially successful, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget. Plot Norm Snively, an alcoholic clown, and his Golden Retriever, Old Blue, are doing a show at a child's birthday party. After Old Blue causes trouble at the party, Snively angrily takes him in a kennel to a dog pound, until the kennel falls out of his truck. Old Blue is homeless until he meets 12-year-old Josh Framm. After the death of his father, a pilot who died in a plane crash during a test flight, Josh has relocated with his mom Jackie and two-year-old sister Andrea from Virginia to Fernfield, Washington. Due to heartbreak over his father's death, he is too shy to try out for his middle school's basketball team and to make any friends. He instead becomes the basketball team's manager, an awkward offer by Coach Barker which he accepts. He practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up in an abandoned allotment, where he meets Old Blue and renames him Buddy. Josh soon discovers that Buddy has the uncanny ability to play basketball, and decides to let Buddy come home with him. Jackie agrees to let him keep Buddy until Christmas and she plans to send him to the pound if his rightful owner is not located; however, she sees how loyal Buddy is and how much Josh loves him. On Christmas, Jackie lets Josh keep Buddy as a present. Following Christmas, Josh finds a tryout invitation in his locker and further realizes Buddy's talent when he discovers that he can actually shoot a hoop. These facts together prompt Josh to try out, and he gets a place on the team. At his first game, he befriends teammate Tom Stewart but earns the disdain of star player and team bully Larry Willingham. Meanwhile, Buddy leaves the backyard, goes to the school and shows up while the game is underway. He runs into the court, disrupts the game, and causes mayhem, but the audience loves him after he scores a basket. Buddy is caught by Josh after the game. The dog then sees Coach Barker abusing Tom by violently pelting him with basketballs in an attempt to make him catch better. He leads Josh, Jackie, and the school principal Ms. Pepper to the scene. As a result, Coach Barker is fired and replaced by the school's kind-hearted engineer, Arthur Chaney, at Josh's suggestion. Buddy becomes the mascot of the school's basketball team and begins appearing in their halftime shows. After the Timberwolves lose one game, the team has subsequent success and qualifies for the state final. Just before the championship game, Snively appears after seeing Buddy on television. Hoping to profit off Buddy's newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy as he has papers proving that he is Buddy's legal owner. Knowing they do not have a choice, Jackie forces Josh to do the right thing and give Buddy back to Snively. After a period of feeling withdrawn and depressed, Josh decides to rescue Buddy. He sneaks into Snively's backyard and finds Buddy chained up. Snively catches Josh escaping with Buddy, and pursues them in his dilapidated clown truck before crashing into a lake. Josh then decides to set Buddy free in the forest to find a new home. Initially, his team is losing at the next championship to the opposing team until Buddy shows up. When it is discovered that there is no rule that a dog could not play basketball, Buddy joins the roster to lead the team to a come from behind championship victory. Snively attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy despite lack of ownership papers. Upon seeing Buddy, Judge Cranfield is disgusted and initially reluctant on a case over a dog but agrees only under a strict condition that the case be executed seriously. After numerous protests, Chaney arrives and suggests that Buddy chooses his owner. As a fan of Chaney himself, Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the lawn. Buddy attacks Snively and chooses Josh. Cranfield orders that Snively be arrested for animal cruelty, while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him home.

Co-written by Barratier and , it is an adaptation of the 1945 film A Cage of Nightingales (La Cage aux rossignols). The story is inspired by the origin of the boys' choir The Little Singers of Paris. The original French title translates as \\"The Choristers\\" or \\"The Choirboys\\", not \\"The Chorus\\". At the 77th Academy Awards, The Chorus was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for \\"Vois sur ton chemin\\", listed as \\"Look to Your Path\\", composed by Bruno Coulais). Plot In 2003, Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin), a French conductor performing in the United States, is informed before a concert that his mother has died. After the performance he returns to his home in France for her funeral. An old friend named Pépinot (Didier Flamand) arrives at his door with a diary which belonged to their teacher, Clément Mathieu. They proceed to read it together. In 1949, fifty- four years earlier, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), a failed musician, arrives at Fond de l'Étang (\\"Bottom of the Pond\\"), a French boarding school for troubled boys, to work as a supervisor and teacher. At the gate, he sees a very young boy, Pépinot (Maxence Perrin), waiting for Saturday, when he says his father will pick him up. The viewers later learn that his parents were killed in the Second World War during the Nazi occupation of France, but Pépinot does not know this. Mathieu discovers the boys being ruthlessly punished by the headmaster Rachin (François Berléand) and attempts to use humour and kindness to win them over. When a booby trap set by one of the boys, LeQuerrec, injures the school's elderly caretaker Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Mathieu keeps the culprit's identity from the headmaster, while encouraging LeQuerrec to nurse Maxence during his recovery. On discovering the boys singing rude songs about him, Mathieu forms a plan: he will teach them to sing and form a choir as a form of discipline. He groups the boys according to their voice types, but one student, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), refuses to sing. Mathieu catches Morhange singing to himself, discovers he has a wonderful singing voice and awards him solo parts on the condition that he behaves. Morhange's single mother, Violette (Marie Bunel), arrives at the school. When Mathieu goes to explain that Morhange cannot be visited because he has been locked up as a punishment, he finds himself pitying and being attracted to the boy's beleaguered mother and instead tells her that Morhange is at the dentist. Meanwhile, a cruel, uncontrollable boy named Mondain () arrives and begins causing trouble by bullying the others and generally being rebellious. After stealing a watch, he is locked up for two weeks. The choir is improving rapidly with Morhange as its lead soloist; the children are happier, and the faculty less strict—even Rachin begins to loosen up, playing football with the boys and making a paper aeroplane. After Mondain is released from lock-up, he runs away. At the same time, all the school's money disappears. After Mondain is captured, Rachin beats him, and Mondain in turn attempts to strangle Rachin. Rachin hands him over to the police, still not knowing the location of the stolen money, and disbands the choir. This causes Mathieu to teach his choir \\"underground\\", practising at night in their dormitory. Mathieu continues to meet Morhange's mother, who is unaware of his attraction to her. He plans to help her son win a scholarship to the music conservatory in Lyon. One day she blithely informs him that she has met someone: an engineer. Mathieu is dejected but expresses his feigned happiness and watches her leave in the engineer's car. The Countess, a sponsor of the school, finds out about the choir; they perform before her and others, and Morhange enchants the audience with his solo. Mathieu discovers that another boy, Corbin, stole the money that Mondain was accused of taking. Despite this, Rachin refuses to accept Mondain back at the school. When Rachin departs to accept an award from the board after taking credit for the choir, Mathieu and Maxence suspend classes and take the boys on an outing. While they are out, Mondain returns and sets fire to the school. Mathieu is fired for breaking the rules, even though he saved the boys' lives, and Maxence is suspended. As Mathieu leaves, the boys—forbidden to say goodbye—lock themselves in their classroom, sing and throw farewell messages out of the window on paper planes. Touched, Mathieu walks away, musing about how he has failed and nobody knows of his existence. Back in the present, the adult Morhange finishes reading the diary and recounts what happened afterwards: he won his scholarship to the conservatory, and Rachin was fired after his fellow teachers exposed his abuse towards the students. Mathieu, Pépinot relates, continued to give music lessons quietly for the rest of his life. The final scene (in the past again) shows Mathieu waiting for his bus after being fired. As he boards it, he looks back and finds Pépinot running after him, insisting that he come too. Initially, Mathieu refuses because it is not allowed, and he leaves Pépinot behind. Suddenly, the bus stops and Mathieu gives in: the two board the bus together. Pépinot finally got his wish, for he and Mathieu left on a Saturday, and Mathieu raised him.

After making the short film Les Tombales, director Christophe Barratier was looking for a subject for his first feature film. He noticed that many of his ideas were linked to his childhood, and the emotions he felt between the ages of four and eight. Coming from a musical background, he also wanted to tell a story linked to music. The themes of childhood and music made him think of the film La Cage aux rossignols, which he had seen on television at a young age and which \\"touched [him] profoundly\\". Barratier told his idea to Gérard Jugnot, whom he had known for quite a long time and with whom he shared a taste for old French cinema and actors such as Noël-Noël; Jugnot liked it but thought that the film would have to be set in the past, otherwise his character would be transformed into someone who \\"teaches rapping in the suburbs\\". Barratier said he did not think about setting the film in the present time because \\"Clément Mathieu [would have] other priorities, he would have nothing in common with a 1950s music teacher\\". Barratier then began writing the script; Jugnot said that the first version somewhat \\"lacked roughness\\", and co-writer Philippe Lopes-Curval got involved. He collaborated with Barratier to strengthen the story and develop the psychology of characters such as Rachin—for whom the children are \\"the symbol of a failed professional life\\"—and Chabert. =Casting= The director was keen that the role of the young Pierre Morhange should be played by a real singer, and the search for him was tedious. While touring large French choirs to choose the one to record the film's soundtrack, they discovered the 12-year-old Jean-Baptiste Maunier of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc: Barratier described his voice as \\"exceptional and very moving\\", and composer Bruno Coulais said it was \\"incredible\\". They decided to cast him as Morhange and use the choir for the soundtrack, but that the rest of the choir would not play his classmates because the director did not want them to be professional actors. Instead, they looked for children near the filming location in Auvergne: casting director Sylvie Brocheré visited primary and secondary schools in Clermont-Ferrand, looking for children between the ages of six and 15. After over 2000 auditions, the roles were cast. Of all the children, only the Parisians Théodule Carré Cassaigne and Thomas Blumenthal had some small acting experience. =Filming= miniature railway museum in Châtillon-sur- Chalaronne Principal photography took place on location at the Château de Ravel in Puy-de-Dôme. Foam and salt were used as artificial snow and green leaves were removed from the grounds, since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the winter. Fog machines were also used around the castle, and walls were deliberately scorched and stripped of paint to give the surroundings a \\"dilapidated\\" look, since boarding schools at the time often suffered from poor funding and management. When filming his first scene in which his character Mondain tries to intimidate Clément Mathieu, Gatignol had trouble behaving menacingly towards Jugnot, who described him as \\"too nice\\". For the scene in which Morhange drops ink on Mathieu's head, gouache was used. During choir scenes, song lyrics were written on large cue cards and the classroom's blackboard to aid actors. The children who played the choir described how their singing improved through the duration of the shoot; Nicolas Porte, the choirmaster of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc, said that this \\"means that the story we tell is credible\\". Bruno Coulais, the composer of the film's score, said that the children \\"are passionate about music\\", which is \\"some kind of escape to them\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack for The Chorus was released on 3 May 2004 by Warner Bros. Records, and subsequently by Nonesuch Records in 2005 and Varèse Sarabande in 2012. It features the film's original score, which was composed by Bruno Coulais and performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Deyan Pavlov) and the choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc. The album's 2012 release added five additional tracks, most of which are the orchestral backing tracks of other songs. Filmtracks summed it up by saying \\"for enthusiasts of boys' choirs and heartwarming, sentimental choral performances in general, The Chorus translates into a strong, albeit repetitive album.\\" The soundtrack topped the albums chart in France for 11 weeks and reached number three in Belgium, before its United States release in early 2005. Around the same time, the live album Les Choristes en concert was released on both CD and DVD. Release In the United States, the film was shown at multiple film festivals—including the Chicago International Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, and the Heartland Film Festival—before opening in New York City and Los Angeles on 14 January 2005. =Box office= The film had a worldwide gross of $83,580,890 including $3,635,164 in the United States and Canada, $2,062,908 in the United Kingdom and $48,765,590 in its native France. It ranked 72 on the list of the highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, and 195 in the US and Canada. =Home media= The Chorus was released on DVD in France (as Les Choristes) on 27 October 2004 by Pathé. On 3 May 2005, Lionsgate released the film on DVD in the United States as The Chorus; on the same day, it was released by Alliance Films in Canada. On 11 July 2005, Pathé released a version with English subtitles in the United Kingdom. Reception =Critical reception= The Chorus received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 68% \\"Fresh\\" rating, indicating that most reviewed it positively, and summarises that \\"While predictable, this low-key heartwarmer manages to be uplifting without overdoing the sentiment.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 56 out of 100 based on 32 critics' reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Peter Howell of the Toronto Star commended the film's \\"credible acting and outstanding score\\", saying they allowed it to \\"[rise] above feelgood status\\". The BBC's Matthew Leyland said \\"even though all the notes are predictable, the film hits them with a wit, warmth and gusto.\\" Many critics felt that the film's format was predictable, and it was widely compared to other films about inspirational teachers, such as Dead Poets Society, Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Mr. Holland's Opus; The Salt Lake Tribune commented \\"if you've seen one inspirational- teacher melodrama ... you've seen this one, too\\" and criticised the movie's \\"one-note characters\\" and \\"plodding predictability\\". Of the title characters, critic Roger Ebert said: \\"Their influence will forever change the lives of their students, and we can see that coming from the opening frame\\", and that The Chorus \\"should have added something new and unexpected\\". Ebert also commented that \\"This feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film.\\" =Accolades= At the 77th Academy Awards, The Chorus was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for \\"Vois sur ton chemin\\", listed as \\"Look to Your Path\\"). At the 58th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay (Christophe Barratier, Philippe Lopes-Curval) and Best Film Not in the English Language, and Bruno Coulais' score was nominated for Best Film Music. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Golden Globe Awards. The 26th Young Artist Awards saw Jean-Baptiste Maunier nominated for Best Performance in an International Feature Film – Leading Young Performer, as well as The Chorus itself for Best International Feature Film. In France, the film won Best Sound (Nicolas Cantin, Nicolas Naegelen, Daniel Sobrino) and its score won Best Music Written for a Film at the 30th César Awards, where The Chorus received a further six nominations: Best Actor (Gérard Jugnot), Best Debut (Christophe Barratier), Best Director (Christophe Barratier), Best Film, Best Production Design (François Chauvaud) and Best Supporting Actor (François Berléand). (Select \\"2005\\" in the menu on the right.) In 2004, Bruno Coulais won the European Film Award for Best Composer; Gérad Jugnot was also nominated for Best Actor, and The Chorus for Best Film. The film later received the Lumières Award for Best Film in 2005, as well as London's Favourite French Film award in 2007.

It was also the first aircraft to fly over the polar ice cap between Europe and America. The expedition was the brainchild of polar explorer and expedition leader Roald Amundsen, the airship's designer and pilot Umberto Nobile and American adventurer and explorer Lincoln Ellsworth who, along with the Aero Club of Norway, financed the trip, which was known as the Amundsen- Ellsworth 1926 Transpolar Flight.  Design and development  120px Norge was the first N-class semi-rigid airship designed by Umberto Nobile, and its construction started in 1923. As part of the selling contract [as the Norge] it was refitted for Arctic conditions. The pressurised envelope was reinforced with metal frames at the nose and tail, with a flexible tubular metal keel connecting the two. This was covered with fabric and used as storage and crew space. Three engine gondolas and the separate control cabin were attached to the bottom of the keel. Norge was the first Italian semi-rigid to be fitted with the cruciform tail fins first developed by the Schütte-Lanz company.  Polar expedition  In 1925, Amundsen telegraphed Nobile asking to meet him at Oslo, where he proposed an airship trip across the Arctic. With a contract in place, Nobile modified the N-1 for cold conditions.Christopher 2010, p. 79 As the expedition was being financed by the Aero Club of Norway the modified N-1 was given the name Norge (English: Norway). Norge on take off at Ciampino Airport On 29 March 1926 at a ceremony at Ciampino aerodrome the Norge was handed over to the Aero Club of Norway. The flight north was due to leave Rome on 6 April but was delayed due to strong winds and departed at 09:25 on 10 April. The ship arrived at RNAS Pulham Airship Station in England at 15:20; because of the bad weather was not moored in the hangar until 18:30. Delayed again by weather, the Norge left Pulham for Oslo at 11:45 on 12 April. At 01:00 on 15 April 1926, the Norge left Ekeberg in Oslo for Gatchina near Leningrad; after a 17-hour flight, the airship arrived at 19:30, delayed by dense fog along the way. Following the arrival at Gatchina, Nobile announced that the Norge would remain in the airship shed for a week for overhaul and maintenance; this included the addition of collapsible rubber boats for emergency use. Although expected to leave Gatchina as soon as the weather allowed after 24 April, the departure was delayed one week as the mast at King's Bay, Spitsbergen had not yet been completed due to adverse weather. Although Nobile was keen to leave for Spitsbergen even if the mast and shed were not completed as he was concerned about the weather, the departure from Gatchina was postponed once again. Mast in Ny-Ålesund The Norge finally left Gatchina at 09:40 on 5 May to proceed to Vadsø in northern Norway, where the airship mast is still standing today. The expedition then crossed the Barents Sea to reach King's Bay at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. There Nobile met Richard Evelyn Byrd preparing his Fokker Trimotor for his North Pole attempt. Nobile explained the Norge trip was to observe the uncharted sea between the Pole and Alaska where some believed land was; at the time he thought Robert Edwin Peary had already reached the pole. This would be the last stop before crossing the pole. The dirigible left Ny-Ålesund for the final stretch across the polar ice on 11 May at 9:55.Kumpch 1996 Mast in Vadsø The 16-man expedition included Amundsen, the expedition leader and navigator; Umberto Nobile the dirigible's designer and pilot; Wealthy American outdoorsman, polar explorer and expedition sponsor Lincoln Ellsworth; as well as polar explorer Oscar Wisting who served as helmsman. Other crew members were 1st Lt. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, navigator; 1st Lt. Emil Horgen, elevatorman; Capt. Birger Gottwaldt, radio expert, Dr Finn Malmgren of Uppsala University, meteorologist;Nobile Fredrik Ramm, journalist; Frithjof Storm-Johnsen, radioman; Flying Lt. Oscar Omdal, flight engineer; Natale Cecioni, chief mechanic; Renato Alessandrini, rigger; Ettore Arduino, Attilio Caratti and Vincenzo Pomella, mechanics. Nobile's little dog, Titina, also came aboard as mascot. On 12 May at 01:25 (GMT) the Norge reached the North Pole, at which point the Norwegian, American and Italian flags were dropped from the airship onto the ice.Kumpch 1996. Amundsen wrote in his notebook that at 02:20 in the morning they were at the North Pole, 200 metres high with a temperature of . Relations between Amundsen and Nobile, which had never been very friendly, were further strained by the freezing and noisy conditions in the dirigible's cramped control car, and became even worse when Amundsen saw that the Italian flag dropped was larger than either of the others. Amundsen later recalled with scorn that under Nobile, the Norge had become \\"a circus wagon of the skies\\".Kumpch 1996: \\"Zirkuswagen am Himmel\\" After crossing the pole, ice encrustations kept growing on the airship's propellors to such an extent that pieces breaking and flying off would strike the outer cover, causing rips and tears in the fabric. On 14 May, the Norge reached the Inupiat village of Teller, Alaska, where in view of worsening weather, the decision was made to land rather than continue the approximately 70 miles to Nome. The airship was reportedly damaged somehow during the landing and was dismantled and shipped back to Italy. The three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole—by Frederick Cook in 1908, Robert Peary in 1909, and Richard E. Byrd in 1926 (just a few days before the Norge)—are all disputed as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud. Some of those disputing these earlier claims therefore consider the crew of the Norge to be the first verified explorers to have reached the North Pole.

It is based on the story Puss in Boots. The film features the voices of Judge Reinhold, Dan Haggerty, Michael York, and Vivian Schilling. Plot The story follows Handsome Gunther, a poor young man whose sole possession is his anthropomorphic cat. The cat, wanting to help his owner out of poverty, decides to use his wit to turn Gunther into a prince. In his plan, the cat tries to help Gunther win the heart of the Princess. However, an evil shapeshifting ogre also has his eyes on marrying the girl. After she is captured, Gunther and his clever cat go after the Princess to rescue her before it is too late. Differences from the original story In the film, the ogre's shape changing abilities and other magical powers are granted by a necklace, which he also must wear to survive during daylight. Also differing from the original tale, is that the ogre wants to marry the Princess. He offers the king unlimited gold, jewels and diamonds for his marrying the king's daughter, but the king refuses. When Puss in Boots tricks the ogre into morphing into a mouse, the ogre escapes him and realizes the deception, then morphs into a large monster and attempts to kill the cat. But his necklace is stolen, and the princess, king, miller's son and cat are able to prevent him from catching the necklace by dawn.

Early life Marcus Ervine-Andrews was born in Keadue, County Cavan, Ireland, on 29 July 1911, the son of a bank manager. He was educated by the Jesuits at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, one of seven recipients of the VC who were educated at Stonyhurst. Ervine-Andrews was commissioned in the East Lancashire Regiment, British Army in January 1932. He was sent to the Indian North West Frontier in 1936–37, where he was Mentioned in Despatches.http://www.lancashireinfantrymuseum.org.uk/captain-later- lieutenant-colonel-harold-marcus-ervine-andrews-vc/ Events at Dunkirk Ervine-Andrews was 28 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, in the latter stages of the Battle of Dunkirk, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. During the night of 31 May/1 June 1940, near Dunkirk, France, the company commanded by Captain Ervine-Andrews had been ordered to defend of territory. Already heavily outnumbered and under intense German fire, when the enemy attacked at dawn and crossed the Canal de Bergues, Ervine-Andrews, with volunteers from his company, rushed to a barn and from the roof shot 17 of the enemy with a rifle and many more with a Bren gun. When the barn was shattered and alight, he sent the wounded to the rear and led the remaining eight men back. =Victoria Cross citation= The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 30 July 1940, reading: Post-war Ervine-Andrews attempted to return home to his native County Cavan after the war, but was driven out by local members of the IRA and later settled in Cornwall.

The definitive issue  The profile portrait chosen was taken by Hugh Cecil's studio. The design was suggested by H.J. Brown, an 18-year-old man, and sent in February 1936 to the postal authorities. It inspired Harrison and Sons printers.\\"Great Britain\\" stamps #457-460, 2008 Commonwealth & British Empire Stamps 1840-1970, Stanley Gibbons, 2007, , page GB15.A.J.

Brown was thanked and told that his project could not be used as such. After the stamps were issued, the father wrote that he was disappointed by the lack of frankness from the Post Office. The only graphic decorations on the stamp were the crown, the denomination in the upper corners, and the word \\"POSTAGE\\" at the bottom. Brown's project, the simplest of all submissions, placed the words \\"POSTAGE\\" and \\"REVENUE\\" on the lateral sides.Reproduced on the cover and page iv of A.J. Kirk in King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974. The Post Office wrote to Mr Brown telling him that his proposed design could not be used. After the stamp came out, clearly using Brown's design, Brown's father issued a statement regretting the Post Office's deceit. Watermarked with a crown and \\"E8R\\", the d green, the d brown and the d blue stamps were issued on 1 September 1936, and the one penny red on 14 September.A.J. Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 12-16. After Edward's abdication there was the usual delay in designing and distributing the stamps of George VI. Thus the Edward VIII stamps remained on sale for months. That, and the large numbers saved by the public, have kept their collector value very low.  Morocco Agencies  The four or part of the four stamps were overprinted to be used in the British post offices in Morocco. For Tangier, the name of the town was overprinted alone. \\"MOROCCO / AGENCIES\\" was overprinted with a new face value in French centimes or Spanish céntimos depending the zone of the post office.A.J.

Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, page 2. In March 1936, the King accepted the idea of larger stamps picturing his effigy and castles. But the abdication stopped all design efforts (despite essays having been made).A.J. Kirk, King Edward VIII, The Great Britain Philatelic Society, 1974, pages 7-8. = Australia = The 2d red stamp project of Australia used a photograph of the King in uniform. The sole ornaments were the denomination in an oval in the bottom right corner and the red \\"POSTAGE\\" bar at the bottom. Printing of this stamp began in September 1936 at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's printing branch. All operations were stopped with the abdication.Lord Vestey and John Michael, Unissued Edward VIII Stamps of Australia (from display to the Society on 11 June 2009, The London Philatelist #1367, Royal Philatelic Society London, July–August 2009, pages 202-3. Despite the destruction of the stock and all material needed for the printing, a 6 × 2d red stamp signed corner block is in the hands of a British collector. On 29 September 1936, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, Governor of Victoria, visited the plant and was invited to sign and date one of the finished sheets. In the name of the Commonwealth Bank, printer John Ash offered the sheet to the Governor in October, but had to claim it back on 16 December. The sheet was given back the next day, but the six stamp corner block bearing the signature was missing. The Governor had already sent it to someone in England and could not retrieve it. = Canada = In Canada, the Edward VIII stamp dies and proofs were officially destroyed on 25 and 27 January 1937; some essays were kept in the archives, and the two plaster casts were saved by coin engraver Emmanuel Hahn and a postal officer.Paul J.

In March 1936, the Canadian Post Office received the photographic profile the new King wanted to be used, and in June it obtained the one received by the Royal Mint. The Canadian Banknote Company worked on traditional ornamented designs with the two pictures with the help of the American Banknote Company, New York. In October, the Post Office received a plaster cast by British artist Hugh Paget. Finally, on 1 December 1936, the project was accepted by Lord Tweedsmuir, the Governor-in-Council.

Doug. It is a remake of the 1965 film That Darn Cat!, which in turn was based on the 1963 book Undercover Cat by Gordon and Mildred Gordon. Plot A pair of bumbling kidnappers break into the house of the president with the intention of kidnapping his wife and holding her for ransom. Things do not go according to plan when they mistakenly kidnap house maid Lizzie instead. Patti Randall is a bored and angry teenage girl who is sick of her quiet and boring town of Edgefield, Massachusetts just 60 miles from Boston. She wishes for more adventure and excitement to come to her boring town. She gets her wish when her pet cat DC walks into the kidnappers' hideout during his nightly prowl. Lizzie gives the cat a watch with \\"HEll\\" scribbled on it. She intended to fully write \\"HELP\\" on it, but had to nix on finishing and quickly put it on DC in such way to avoid being caught when the kidnappers' phone rings near her. Patti sees the watch the next morning and immediately puts it together that the watch was from Lizzie and was meant to say HELP. Nobody believes Patti, causing her to doctor the evidence by turning the last L on the watch into a P. She goes to Boston and pleads her case to Agent Zeke Kelso at the FBI and he believes her. Zeke's captain allows Zeke and his agent to tail DC during his prowl in hopes of being led to the kidnappers and Lizzie. The operation goes nowhere, causing Zeke to be taken off the case. Zeke and Patti continue investigating anyway, which leads to nothing but dead ends and eventually ends with them being arrested. Patti's manipulation of the watch evidence gets exposed shortly thereafter. Patti is punished by her parents for her actions. She is so distraught that she decides to run away and leave town. Through having met someone at the train station who is leaving for the same reasons as her, and through a personal conversation, she eventually comes to her senses and decides not to board the next train out of town. Patti sees DC digging through the town garden on her walk back from the train station. DC takes off and Patti chases him. The cat leads her to the kidnappers' hideout, where they find Lizzie bound and gagged with duct tape. Patti calls Zeke to let him know that she has found Lizzie. Zeke is still upset with Patti, and does not want to hear it. This causes Patti and DC to enter the kidnappers' hideout. Patti attempts to rescue Lizzie, but she fails and in the process gets herself and DC captured, as the kidnappers show up and surprise her. Zeke decides to re-open the case after he gets a call from Patti's parents asking if he has seen her since she went missing. Zeke investigates and follows a trail that leads him to the kidnappers. He finds Lizzie, Patti, and DC bound and gagged; Lizzie and Patti tied to chairs with their mouths duct taped, while DC sat in a litter box trapped inside a burlap sack with black cloth over his eyes. Zeke exposes the identities of the kidnappers as the seemingly harmless Ma and Pa. Ma and Pa kidnapped Lizzie because they partied away all their cash in Monte Carlo and the Riviera, plus they were also bored out of their skulls. Zeke manages to free Patti and DC while Ma and Pa escape with Lizzie in their possession. A final chase ensues as Zeke, Patti, and DC attempt to catch Ma and Pa and rescue Lizzie. During the chase, Spike the dog escapes after his fence breaks down and runs at the cat show, which causes all the cats to run out. DC joins them and run up top the roofs of each building, DC and the cats jump off and land on Ma and Pa's car, causing them to crash. Ma and Pa are arrested, Lizzie is reunited with the President and his Wife, Patti and DC are nominated as heroes, Patti is reunited with her parents. After everything is back to normal, Dusty and Rollo the two rival car repairmen are now working together, Melvin and Lu end up together. Patti has also become Zeke's partner, DC has married the cat he saw in the window earlier, and they have kittens. Cast * Christina Ricci as Patti Randall * Doug E.

Retrieved January 14, 2013. =Critical response= That Darn Cat received generally negative reviews, currently holding a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes amongst critics.The films Rotten Tomatoes page Stephen Holden of the New York Times was not impressed, remarking, 'The opening scenes in That Darn Cat suggest that the movie might have found a gently sarcastic attitude in tune with the know-it-all mood of the late 1990s ... Unfortunately, it isn't long before this wised-up tone gives way to a desperate, mindless freneticism that leaves Ms. Ricci mired in her sulk.' Joe Leydon of Variety said 'It's not quite a catastrophe, but the updated remake of \\"That Darn cat\\" is a loud and largely charmless trifle.' James Berardinelli of Reelviews was a little more lenient, stating '(the film) is a little more quirky than many Disney films, although that trait doesn't make it appreciably more watchable.' In January 1998, it was included on Siskel and Ebert's \\"Worst Films of 1997\\" episode. Accolades The film, in spite of the poor reception, earned Ricci two award nominations; the first was a Kids Choice Award for \\"Favorite Movie Actress\\" and the second was a Young Artist Award - \\"Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film\\".

Background Henry Hook's grave, Churcham Born in Churcham, Gloucestershire, Hook originally served in the Monmouth Militia for five years before enlisting in the regular army in March 1877, aged 26. Previously serving in the 9th Xhosa War in 1877, he received a scalp injury during the battle of Rorke's Drift, and retired from the regular army 17 months later in June 1880, but later served 20 years in 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, reaching the rank of Sergeant-Instructor. He received his VC from Sir Garnet Wolseley, GOC South Africa at Rorke's Drift on 3 August 1879. After his 1880 discharge he was found the position of Inside Duster at the British Museum thanks to the intervention of Gonville Bromhead, Lord Chelmsford and the Prince of Wales. He was subsequently promoted to take charge of readers umbrellas, before resigning due to ill health in 1904.The Story of the British Museum by Marjorie Caygill, British Museum Press, 2nd edition 1992, p44 During this period he lived at Sydenham Hill. He died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 12 March 1905 at Osborne Villas, Roseberry Avenue, Gloucester and is buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Churcham. Rorke's Drift Alfred Henry Hook was 28 years old, and a private in B Company of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. Hook and five other privates were ordered on the afternoon of 22 January 1879 to protect approximately 30 patients unable to be moved from the temporary hospital at Rorke's Drift station. On 22/23 January 1879 at Rorke's Drift, Natal, South Africa, a distant room of the hospital had been held for more than an hour by three privates, and when finally they had no ammunition left the Zulus burst in, and killed one of the men and two patients. One of the privates (John Williams), however, succeeded in knocking a hole in the partition and taking the last two patients through into the next ward, where he found Private Hook. \\"These two men then worked together - one holding the enemy at bayonet point while the other broke through three more partitions - and they were then able to bring eight patients into the inner line of defence.\\" The 1881 census shows Henry Hook V.C. as a servant in the household of George Owen Willis, a doctor in Monmouth, Monmouthshire. The medal His Victoria Cross is displayed at the South Wales Borderers Museum, Brecon, Powys, Wales. In popular culture A poem describing Hook's part in the battle of Rorke's Drift was written by William McGonagall in 1899. In the film Zulu, Hook is depicted as an insubordinate malingerer placed under arrest in the hospital, only to come good during the battle. However, Saul David writes in his book, Zulu: The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879, that he was there as the hospital cook, subsequently as part of a small guard detail assigned to protect the patients. Saul David continues that far from the miscreant portrayed, Hook was actually a teetotaler, Methodist preacher and model soldier. Further to this, he had been awarded Good Conduct pay shortly before the battle. His elderly daughters were so offended at the way their father had been depicted in the film that they walked out of the premiere.Alex von Tunzelmann, Reel History: The World According to the Movies, Atlantic Books (2015) - Google Books[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/reel- history-zulu-michael-caine Zulu: Michael Caine loses the plot, but wins the battle: Cy Endfield's 1964 Anglo-Zulu war tale may omit the salient facts and fulsome moustaches of the real skirmish of Rorke's Drift, but it's great entertainment - The Guardian 11 February 2010] He was portrayed by English actor James Booth. S.M. Stirling's On the Oceans of Eternity fictionalizes Hook's exploits. Hook can also be seen in a background scene in the Alan Moore-penned comic-series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, vol.I, issue 6. Related detail In his autobiography, pop singer Mark E. Smith claimed that Hook was an ancestor of his father, which led to the Smith family being invited as guests of honour to the Whitefield showing of Zulu. References External links * Pte.

It is part of South Bull - a major component of the south side of Dublin Bay, and part of the Dublin Bay Biosphere Reserve. South Bull is a mirror to the North Bull sandbank, which grew into North Bull Island. Sandymount Strand is a popular place for locals to take a walk. People, and in the past - there is no longer public vehicular access - cars, have been occasionally trapped by the incoming tide. A large inlet of water that remains even at low tide is known locally as \\"Cockle Lake\\".  History  In the 1930s, the strand was included as a suggested location for the construction of a new Dublin airport. The baths Sandymount swimming baths; in the background: the Poolbeg Generating Station The Merrion Promenade Pier and Baths Co built Sandymount swimming baths in 1883. The baths measured approximately 40 by 40 metres, with a 75-metre pier added in 1884. The pier featured a bandstand halfway along it and summer concerts were regularly held there for many years. By 1920, the pier had deteriorated so much that it had to be demolished. The concrete baths section, which resembles a small harbour, remains. Martello Tower About halfway along the strand is a Martello tower, part of a system of defenses built in 1804 to warn of an invasion by Napoleon. The Tower was used by the Dublin United Tramways Company as an office, and was also a popular cafe back in the 1960s. An attempt to turn the tower into a restaurant led to the installation of a large window with roller blinds on the seaward side of the tower. The restaurant never opened, leaving the tower with the modified window. An Cailín Bán / Awaiting the Mariner sculpture on Sandymount Strand.  Awaiting the Mariner (An Cailín Bán)  At the end of the strand walkway lies a 20-foot high metal sculpture donated by Mexican President Vicente Fox in November 2002, symbolizing the friendship between the Irish and Mexican people. This work, named Awaiting the Mariner, was created by Mexican sculptor Sebastián and was the first permanent work by a Mexican artist in Dublin. There was a mixed reaction when the sculpture was originally placed from residents.  Gallan Gréine  The Gallan Gréine marker stone is located at the end of the strand beside the Irishtown playing fields. Carved by Cliodna Cussen and dedicated to James Joyce in 1983, a sighting stone stands 300 metres to the west and when aligned with the marker stone to the east, indicates the winter solstice with the sun rising over Killiney Hill around 21 December each year. The face of this stone is also a sundial. In fiction - Ulysses, James Joyce. James Joyce based two episodes of his epic 1922 novel Ulysses at the beach; On the morning of Bloomsday, in the Proteus episode, Stephen Dedalus wanders \\"into eternity\\" on the strand; later the same day, Leopold Bloom sits on a rock and watches while young Gertie lifts her skirt as Bloom masturbates. It was this incident in the Nausicaa episode which led to the banning of the book in the United States for alleged obscenity.

Juvenile traits  Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the maxilla and mandible) as a function of age Doug Jones, a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University, said that the proportions of facial features change with age due to changes in hard tissue and soft tissue, and Jones said that these \\"age-related changes\\" cause juvenile animals to have the \\"characteristic 'cute' appearance\\" of proportionately smaller snouts, higher foreheads and larger eyes than their adult counterparts. In terms of hard tissue, Jones said that the neurocranium grows a lot in juveniles while the bones for the nose and the parts of the skull involved in chewing food only reach maximum growth later. In terms of soft tissue, Jones said that the cartilaginous tissues of the ears and nose continue to grow throughout a person's lifetime, starting at age twenty-five the eyebrows descend on the \\"supraorbital rim\\" from a position above the supraorbital rim to a position below it, the \\"lateral aspect of the eyebrows\\" sags with age, making the eyes appear smaller, and the red part of the lips gets thinner with age due to loss of connective tissue.

New York: Springer Science. =Biological function= Konrad Lorenz argued in 1949 that infantile features triggered nurturing responses in adults and that this was an evolutionary adaptation which helped ensure that adults cared for their children, ultimately securing the survival of the species. Some later scientific studies have provided further evidence for Lorenz's theory. For example, it has been shown that human adults react positively to infants who are stereotypically cute. Studies have also shown that responses to cuteness—and to facial attractiveness in general—seem to be similar across and within cultures.Van Duuren, Mike; Kendell-Scott, Linda; Stark, Natalie. \\"Early Aesthetic Choices: Infant Preferences for Attractive Premature Infant Faces\\" (PDF), King Alfred's College.

Background to archaeology: Britain in its European setting. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. hard cover Physical anthropologist Barry Bogin said that the pattern of children's growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete, when \\"dental maturation is only 58 percent complete\\" and when \\"reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete\\". Bogin said that this allometry of human growth allows children to have a \\"superficially infantile\\" appearance (large skull, small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other \\"mammalian species\\". Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a \\"nurturing\\" and \\"care-giving\\" response in \\"older individuals\\".Bogin, B. (1997). Evolutionary Hypotheses for Human Childhood. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, vol. 40, pp. 63–89 Neoteny in humans is characterized by attributes of a large cranium, large eyes, small face, and small body  Gender differences  The perceived cuteness of an infant is influenced by the gender and behavior of the infant. In the Koyama et al. (2006) research, female infants are seen as cute for the physical attraction that female infants display more than male infants; whereas research by Karraker (1990) demonstrates that a caregiver's attention and involvement in the male infant's protection could be solely based on the perception of happiness and attractiveness of the child. The gender of an observer can determine their perception of the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) it was suggested that women were more sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive hormones in women are important for determining cuteness. This finding has also been demonstrated in a study conducted by T.R. Alley in which he had 25 undergraduate students (consisting of 7 men and 18 women) rate cuteness of infants depending on different characteristics such as age, behavioral traits, and physical characteristics such as head shape, and facial feature configuration. Preference in young children Borgi et al. stated that young children demonstrate a preference for faces with a more \\"infantile facial\\" arrangement i.e. a rounder face, a higher forehead, bigger eyes, a smaller nose and a smaller mouth. In a study that used three- to six-year-old children, Borgi et al. (2014) asserted that the children showed a viewing time preference toward the eyes of \\"high infantile\\" faces of dogs, cats and humans as opposed to \\"low infantile\\" faces of those three species.Borgi, M. et al. (2014). Baby schema in human and animal faces induces cuteness perception and gaze allocation in children. In Frontiers in Psychology. 5(411).  Hormones and cuteness variation  There are suggestions that hormone levels can affect a person's perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that \\"caretaking behaviour and affective orientation\\" towards infants as an innate mechanism, and this is triggered by cute characteristics such as \\"chubby cheeks\\" and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups on their ability to detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that premenopausal women detected cuteness better than same aged postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking birth control pills that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than same aged women not taking the pill. Sprengelmeyer gathered 24 young women, 24 young men, and 24 older women to participate in his study. He ran three studies in which images of white European babies were shown, and the participants were asked to rate them on a cuteness scale of one to seven. The study found differences among the groups in cuteness discrimination, which ruled out cohort and social influences on perceived cuteness. In the second study it was found that premenopausal women discriminated cuteness at a higher level than their postmenopausal female peers. This finding suggested a biological factor, which was then investigated further in the third study. Here, Sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity between premenopausal women who were, and were not taking oral contraceptives. The study concluded that post-perceptual processes were impacted by hormone levels (progesterone and estrogen specifically) in females, and thus impacted sensitivity to cuteness.  Caregiving correlates  A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of \\"cute\\". However a study by Thomas Alley found no such correlation and pointed out faulty procedures in that study. Alley's study found that cephalic head shape of an infant did induce a positive response from adults, and these children were considered to be more \\"cute\\". In his study, Alley had 25 undergraduate students rate line drawings of an infant's face. The same drawing was used each time, however the cephalic head shape was changed using a cardioidal transformation (a transformation that models cephalic growth in relation to ageing process) to adjust the perceived age; other features of the face were not changed. The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking. The study also noted that perceived cuteness was also dependent on other physical and behavioural characteristics of the child, including age. In a study by McCabe (1984) of children whose ages ranged from toddlers to teenagers, the children with more \\"adult-like\\" facial proportions were more likely to have experienced physical abuse than children of the same age who had less \\"adult- like\\" facial proportions.Bruce, V. & Young, A. (2012). Face Perception. USA & Canada: Psychology Press. (hbk) A study by Karraker (1990) suggested that \\"an adult's beliefs about the personality and expected behavior of an infant can influence the adult's interaction with the infant\\", and gave evidence that in this way \\"basic cuteness effects may occasionally be obscured in particular infants\\". Koyama (2006) said that an adult caregiver's perception of an infant's cuteness can motivate the amount of care and protection the caregiver provides, and the admiration demonstrated toward the infant, and concluded that \\"the adults' protective feeling for children appeared to be a more important criterion for the judgment of a boy's cuteness.\\" Melanie Glocker (2009) provided experimental evidence that infants' cuteness motivates caretaking in adults, even if they are not related to the infant. Glocker asked individuals to rate the level of cuteness of pictured infants and noted the motivation that these participants had to care for the infants. The research suggested that individuals' rating of the perceived cuteness of an infant corresponded to the level of motivation an individual had to care for this infant. Glocker and colleagues then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to demonstrate that baby faces with higher content of baby schema features, generated more activation in the nucleus accumbens, a small brain area central to motivation and reward. This work elucidated the neural mechanism through which baby schema (Kindchenschema) may motivate (\\"release\\") caretaking behavior. Furthermore, cute infants were more likely to be adopted and rated as more \\"likeable, friendly, healthy and competent\\" than infants who were less cute. There is an implication that baby schema response is crucial to human development because it lays the foundation for care giving and the relationship between child and caretaker. Sherman, Haidt, & Coan (2009), in two experiments, found that exposure to high cuteness stimuli increased performance when playing the Operation game, a task that requires extreme carefulness. The study said that the shift in behavior toward greater carefulness is consistent with the viewpoint that cuteness is something that releases the human caregiving system. The study said that the shift in behavior toward greater carefulness also makes sense as an adaptation for caring for small children.Sherman, G. D., Haidt, J., & Coan, J.A. (2009). Viewing Cute Images Increases Behavioral Carefulness. Emotion, 9(2). Pages 283 - 285. Link.  Cultural significance  Doug Jones, a visiting scholar in anthropology at Cornell University, said that the faces of monkeys, dogs, birds and even the fronts of cars can be made to appear cuter by morphing them with a \\"cardioidal\\" (heart-shaped) mathematical transformation. Jones said that negative cardioidal strain results in faces appearing less mature and cuter by causing facial features at the top of the face to expand outward and upward while causing features at the bottom of the face to contract inward and upward. Stephen Jay Gould said that over time Mickey Mouse had been drawn to resemble a juvenile more with a relatively larger head, larger eyes, a larger and more bulging cranium, a less sloping and more rounded forehead, shorter, thicker and \\"pudgier\\" legs, thicker arms and a thicker snout which gave the appearance of being less protrusive. Gould suggested that this change in Mickey's image was intended to increase his popularity by making him appear cuter and \\"inoffensive\\". Gould said that the neotenous changes to Mickey's form were similar to the neotenous changes that occurred in human evolution.Gould, S.J. (1980).\\"A Biological Homage to Mickey Mouse\\", in The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History. W.W. Norton & Company. Nancy Etcoff, Ph.D. in psychology from Boston University, said \\"cartoonists capitalize on our innate preferences for juvenile features\\", and she mentioned Mickey Mouse and Bambi as examples of this trend. She said Mickey Mouse's bodily proportions \\"aged in reverse\\" since his inception, because \\"[h]is eyes and head kept getting bigger while his limbs kept getting shorter and thicker\\", culminating in him resembling a \\"human infant\\". She further mentioned the \\"exaggerated high forehead\\" and the \\"doe eyes\\" of Bambi as another example of this trend.Etcoff, N. (1999). Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty.

Oakland, CA: Ronin Publishing, Inc. said cute animals get more public attention and scientific study due to having physical characteristics that would be considered neotenous from the perspective of human development. Estren said that humans should be mindful of their bias for cute animals, so animals that would not be considered cute are also valued in addition to cute animals. The perception of cuteness is culturally diverse. The differences across cultures can be significantly associated to the need to be socially accepted. Cute animals Sherman, Haidt, & Coan (2009) used images of puppies and kittens for the study's \\"high cuteness\\" stimuli in two experiments. William R. Miller, assistant professor of biology at Baker University in Kansas, said that most people, upon seeing tardigrades, say that they are the cutest invertebrates.Miller, W.R. (2011).

He played as a left fielder in Major League Baseball for three American League teams from 1933 to 1945, primarily the Philadelphia Athletics. His elder brother Roy was a major league outfielder from 1929 to 1938. Johnson was the fifth player to have nine consecutive seasons of 20 or more home runs, and his 288 career HRs ranked eighth in major league history when he retired. Usually playing on inferior teams, he batted .300 five times, had eight seasons with 100 runs batted in, and finished his career among the AL's top five right-handed hitters in career RBI (1,283), runs (1,239), slugging average (.506), total bases (3,501) and walks (1,075). He held the Athletics franchise record for career runs from 1942 to 1993. He also ranked among the AL leaders in games in left field (3rd, 1,592) and outfield putouts (10th, 4,003) and assists (8th, 208) when his career ended. Early years Born in Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, Johnson grew up in Tacoma, Washington, and thereafter made the city his home. His nickname was derived from his lineage, which was one-quarter Cherokee. Due to the abundance of quality outfielders in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he did not reach the major leagues until 1933, when he was 27. Major league career =Philadelphia Athletics= Johnson joined the Athletics in , replacing Al Simmons, who had been traded to the Chicago White Sox. Philadelphia had won three straight pennants from 1929 to 1931, but after a second-place finish in 1932 owner-manager Connie Mack began gradually dealing away most of his star players in order to keep the club afloat financially during the Great Depression. As a rookie Johnson hit .290 with 20 home runs, 103 runs and 93 RBI, and was second in the AL with 44 doubles. But the team ended the season in third place; their 79–72 record was their last winning season until 1947, and they would occupy last place in six of Johnson's 10 seasons, along with two seventh-place finishes. Catcher Mickey Cochrane and pitcher Lefty Grove were traded in December 1933, speeding the team's decline. Johnson took full advantage of playing in Shibe Park, which had long been a decidedly friendly environment for right-handed hitters such as Simmons and Jimmie Foxx. In Johnson improved his average to .307, including a 26-game hitting streak, and added a career-high 34 home runs along with 111 runs and 92 RBI; he also led the league with 17 assists. On June 16 he tied an AL record by going 6-for-6 with two home runs and a double. In 1935 he made his first All-Star team, had 103 runs and 109 RBI, and finished fourth in the AL in home runs (28) for the third straight year. Foxx and Doc Cramer were traded in late 1935, and over the next several years Johnson provided solid and consistent offensive production as the A's remained mired at the bottom of the league. He was among the league's top 10 home run hitters in every season through 1941, joining Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott and Foxx as the fifth player to have nine straight 20-HR campaigns. He also drove in over 100 runs in each year through 1941, scoring over 110 in 1938 and 1939; he was again an All-Star each year from 1938 through 1940. He set an AL record by driving in six runs in the first inning with a grand slam and a double off White Sox pitcher Monty Stratton on August 29, 1937; then, in an 8–3 victory over the St. Louis Browns on June 12, 1938, he drove in all the runs with three home runs and a single. That year, playing primarily in center field, he again led the AL with 21 assists. After hitting .306 and .313 in 1937 and 1938, Johnson posted a career-high mark of .338 in - third in the AL behind Joe DiMaggio (.381) and Foxx (.360) - and placed eighth in the MLB Most Valuable Player Award voting; he was also third in the AL with 114 RBI. In , his last season with the Athletics, he made his fifth All-Star team and broke Foxx's team record of 975 career runs; his final total of 997 remained the club record until Rickey Henderson broke it in . Johnson left the Athletics ranking second in franchise history to Jimmy Dykes in games (1,459) and at bats (5,428); second to Simmons in total bases (2,824); second to Foxx in home runs (252); and third behind Simmons and Foxx in hits (1,617) and RBI (1,040). He led the Athletics in RBI in each of his last seven seasons there following Foxx's departure. =Washington Senators= In March 1943, after complaining that he was underappreciated, Johnson was traded at his request to the Washington Senators for outfielder Bobby Estalella and cash. He thrived in his first pennant race in years as Washington finished in second place, the second and last time he would be on a winning team. His veteran leadership was invaluable to the team, as despite posting career lows in nearly every offensive category - a .265 batting average, .400 slugging average, seven home runs, 63 RBI, 65 runs, 116 hits, 22 doubles, 117 games and 438 at bats - he placed fifth in the Most Valuable Player Award balloting (the highest finish of his career) and was again an All-Star. The decline in his offensive statistics is partially attributable to moving from hitter-friendly Shibe Park to cavernous Griffith Stadium; but as he did not even lead his own team in any category, the respect suggested by the Most Valuable Player vote is remarkable. =Boston Red Sox= At the end of the 1943 season, Johnson's contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox, a deal Washington owner Clark Griffith later described as his worst ever. At 38, Johnson had an excellent season for the Sox, collecting 106 RBI and 106 runs (both second in the league) in 144 games and leading the AL with a .431 on-base percentage. He hit for the cycle on July 6, came in third in the batting race with a .324 average (behind Lou Boudreau, .327, and teammate Bobby Doerr, .325), lost the slugging title to Doerr by a fraction of a point, and was 10th in the Most Valuable Player Award voting. He was named to the All-Star team in both 1944 and 1945, although the 1945 All-Star game was not played due to World War II travel restrictions. With numerous players returning to the major leagues from military service, he retired at the end of the season after hitting .280 with 12 HRs and 74 RBI. =Statistics= Johnson compiled a .296 career batting average with 2,051 hits, 396 doubles, 95 triples and 96 stolen bases in 1,863 games. His 1,592 games in left field then put him behind only Goose Goslin (1,949) and Bobby Veach (1,671) in AL history. Many modern baseball fans are unfamiliar with Johnson, but he posted excellent totals in 13 years before quietly retiring. { border=\\"1\\" -----  Seasons  BA  G  AB  R  H  TB  2B  3B  HR  RBI  BB  SO  SB  OBP  SLG  OPS  FLD% -----  13  .296  1863  6920  1239  2051  3501  396  95  288  1283  1075  851  96  .393  .506  .899  .967 } While primarily a left fielder, Johnson also played 167 games in center field, 39 games at first base, 28 games at second base, 27 games in right field, and 20 games at third base. He was ejected only once in his career, in 1937 by umpire Charles Johnston, for arguing balls and strikes. Johnson spoiled no-hit games by getting the only hit for his club three times, one of them a homer off Yankee ace Lefty Gomez on June 30, 1937. Johnson is one of three players in major league history to drive in all his club's runs in a single game (minimum eight runs); :On June 14, 1924, first baseman George Kelly hit three home runs to drive in all eight New York Giants runs in an 8–6 win over the Cincinnati Reds. :Johnson matched this one-man offensive on June 12, 1938, when the Athletics beat the St. Louis Browns 8–3, driving in all the runs with two home runs (one a grand slam, his second of the month) and a single. :The mark was surpassed on September 2, 1996, in a ten-inning game, when Mike Greenwell got all nine RBI in a Boston 9–8 victory over the Seattle Mariners. Johnson was the first of only two players (the other was Ichiro Suzuki) to make his major league debut after his 27th birthday, and still finish with over 2000 hits. https://twitter.com/EliasSports/status/1108733622838878209 Later years After leaving the major leagues, Johnson spent five more seasons in the minor leagues managing and playing for the Tacoma Tigers in the Western International League. He died in Tacoma in 1982 of heart failure at age 76. =Legacy= In 1964, Johnson was inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame. He was honored by the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in 1989. Baseball author Bob Carroll commented on Johnson; \\"Indian Bob Johnson never had one of those super seasons that make everyone sit up and whistle. While phenoms came, collected their MVP trophies, and faded, he just kept plodding along hitting .300, with a couple dozen homers and a hundred ribbies year after year. Like a guy punching a time clock.\\" See also * List of lifetime home run leaders through history * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders References Further reading *Career highlights at Baseball Library via Wayback Machine *Obituary from The Deadball Era  External links , or Retrosheet * 1905 births 1982 deaths People from Pryor Creek, Oklahoma Sportspeople from Tacoma, Washington Major League Baseball left fielders Philadelphia Athletics players Boston Red Sox players Washington Senators (1901–1960) players American League All-Stars Baseball players from Oklahoma Native American sportspeople American people of Cherokee descent ","title":"Bob Johnson (outfielder)"},{"id":"1204697","text":"Milliken may refer to: Places * Milliken, Colorado, a town in the United States *Milliken, West Virginia, an unincorporated community in the United States * Milliken, Ontario, a neighbourhood of Toronto, Canada ** Milliken GO Station, a station in the GO Transit network located in the community * Milliken Creek (disambiguation) * Milliken Park railway station, Renfrewshire, Scotland, United Kingdom People *Milliken (surname) *Milliken, the standard citation for American botanist Jessie Milliken Other * Milliken & Company, one of the world's largest private textile firms * Milliken v.

The film was based on the 1963 novel Undercover Cat by Gordon and Mildred Gordon. The title song was written by the Sherman Brothers and sung by Bobby Darin. The 1997 remake includes a cameo appearance by Dean Jones. That Darn Cat! was both Hayley Mills' final film in the series of six for the Walt Disney Studios, and Dean Jones' first film for Disney. Plot \\"Darn Cat\\" or \\"DC\\" is a wily, adventurous Siamese tomcat who lives with young suburbanite sisters Ingrid \\"Inky\\" (Dorothy Provine) and Patricia \\"Patti\\" Randall (Hayley Mills) and enjoys an evening route wandering thru town which includes teasing local dogs, swiping food, and marking vehicles with muddy paws. One night, DC follows bank robber Iggy (Frank Gorshin) into an apartment where he and his partner Dan (Neville Brand) are holding bank employee Miss Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall) hostage. Miss Miller uses the opportunity to replace his collar with her watch, on which she has inscribed most of the word \\"HELP,\\" and releases him to go home to the Randalls'. Patti discovers the watch on DC and suspects that it belongs to the kidnapped woman. She goes to the FBI and tells Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones) of her discovery, and Supervisor Newton (Richard Eastham) assigns Kelso to follow DC in the hope that he will lead them back to the robbers' hideout. Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but, despite multiple attempts and a bugging system, DC eludes them in humiliating and comedic ways, culminating in a chase where he leads Agent Kelso through several back yards and a drive-in theatre. As DC ends up trying to open a pigeon cage and is discovered by the owner Gregory Benson (Roddy McDowall), who is also Ingrid's carpool, chases DC and Kelso and, out of frustration, tells Ingrid he quits being her carpool. The next day agent Kelso's supervisor Newton shuts down the operation, considering the evidence of the watch not hard enough, but Patti disguises herself as the hippie niece of her friend Mr. Hoffsteddar (Ed Wynn) the jeweler and persuades the FBI that the watch was indeed hard evidence. Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice. Subplots involve a romance between Patti's sister Ingrid and Kelso as he becomes her new carpool, and a romance between Patti herself and a surf-obsessed slacker neighbor, Canoe Henderson (Tom Lowell), and the meddling of nosy neighbor Mrs. MacDougall (Elsa Lanchester) and her disapproving husband, Wilmer MacDougall (William Demarest). At the end, it is revealed that the gray cat in the opening sequence and DC are taking their kittens on a prowl, having started a family.

Early life and education  He studied in Michigan, USA, in 1969. He studied natural sciences as well as psychology and anthropology at the University of Oslo, resulting in a Dr.scient (1981) and a Dr.philos (1984) from the same university.  Work roles  Grinde worked as a scientist and professor at leading universities in Norway, USA, and Japan. Presently he works as a chief scientist at the Division of Mental and Physical Health Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Areas of interest and research =Molecular evolution= Some of his earlier projects focused on molecular evolution, using viruses as a model system. =Happiness= A prime interest has been to understand how evolution has shaped the human brain, and to use this knowledge of human behavioral biology (also referred to as evolutionary psychology) to improve health and quality of life. This approach argues that natural selection has shaped human behaviour and its neural substrate, and thus our emotional and rational systems are evolved to optimize hunting and gathering behaviour in small groups rather than to be economically rational in modern human life. Grinde has advanced a theory that happiness results from minimising experienced pain and maximising experienced pleasure. He advocates seeking happiness by methods including reducing the activity levels of 'punishment' systems in our brains, such as by self-talk to reduce anxiety. Grinde is not against hedonic pleasures like chocolate or alcohol, but argues that the empirical result is that these do not give long-term life happiness.\\"Chemical stimulants do not appear to be a good long-term strategy for contentment\\". p104, Darwinian Happiness. He has published several books on this topic, including Darwinian Happiness (2002) and The Biology of Happiness (2012). =Consciousness= He has also focused on understanding what consciousness is about, and why we have this feature.

A member of the Republican Party, Woods served as the third Governor of Oregon from 1866–1870. Failing to win renomination, Woods was then appointed Territorial Governor of Utah by President Ulysses S. Grant, serving in that position from 1871–1875. Biography =Early years= George Lemuel Woods was born July 30, 1832 in Boone County, Missouri, the second of four boys born to Caleb Woods and the former Margaret McBride.John B. Horner, Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. J.K. Gill Co.: Portland, 1921; pp. 125, 153–154, 176. His ancestors came to North America from Scotland in the late 17th Century, settling first in Virginia before moving to the Kentucky frontier.Oscar T. Shuck, Representative and Leading Men of the Pacific. San Francisco: Bacon and Co., 1870; pg. 271. His father had moved to Missouri in 1808. In 1847, when George was just 15, his parents moved to the Oregon Territory.Howard M. Corning, Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. In Oregon, the family settled in Yamhill County, George was educated in the public schools. In April 1852, Woods was married to Louisa A. McBride.Shuck, Representative and Leading Men of the Pacific, pp. 271-272. The couple would have two sons. The young couple took a homestead on unimproved government land, which Woods cleared, fenced, and plowed.Shuck, Representative and Leading Men of the Pacific, pg. 272. Unsatisfied with rural life, in 1856 Woods sold his property and enrolled at McMinnville College, where he studied law. Working as a carpenter during the day and studying at night, Woods purchased a small law library and was eventually admitted to the bar in 1858, setting up a private practice. Woods proved capable at the task and gained recognition as a proficient attorney. =Political career= In 1857, Woods organized Republican clubs in the state and was a noted speaker of the party. Woods was appointed a judge in Wasco County in 1863. He was nominated as a presidential elector in March 1864 and was active in the campaign to re-elect Abraham Lincoln to the presidency, gaining a following as an eloquent and effective orator and stump speaker. Woods toured the state as leading representative of the National Union Party (Republican-Pro-War Democrat coalition), debating the anti-war Democrat Aaron E. Wait, Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. In 1865 he was appointed to serve on the Idaho Territory’s Supreme Court, but before his formal commission arrived he was nominated for governor by the Union Party.Shuck, Representative and Leading Men of the Pacific, pg. 273. Woods won election over his Democratic opponent, prominent attorney James L. Kelly, in a heated and intense campaign, becoming the third Governor of the state of Oregon. His term began on September 12, 1866 and continued until September 14, 1870.Oregon Blue Book: Elections Process and History An 1870 portrait of Woods by one who had heard him speak on numerous occasions characterized the \\"positive and magnetic\\" Governor as > \\"...tall, graceful, and commanding, with a handsome, cheerful face, which is > set off by a full, flowing beard and manifesting the utmost mental > activity.... His manner of speaking is rapid, but distinct and impressive, > never using long or high-sounding words or indulging in any extravagance or > impropriety or metaphor. He seems to depend on the natural forces of ideas > rather than upon the sonorousness of words; and although never written, > unless by some very swift reporter at the time of their delivery, his > speeches would be considered well adapted to the most refined of lecture- > rooms.... Perhaps no American orator is capable of a quicker or keener > retort, but it is a cut from a rapier, rather than a stroke with a > bludgeon.\\"Shuck, Representative and Leading Men of the Pacific, pg. 274. Woods' prowess as a public speaker placed him in demand for other candidates around the country, and he made campaign speaking tours on behalf of Republican candidates in California in 1867 — where he made 30 speeches in 35 nights — and the New England states of New Hampshire and Connecticut in 1868. Woods failed to win re-election but was immediately appointed by new Republican President Ulysses S. Grant as the Governor of Utah Territory in 1871. Woods proved to be a critic of Mormon leader Brigham Young, and was not reappointed in 1875 at the conclusion of his term.Hal Schindler, \\"The Territorial Governors,\\" Salt Lake Tribune, Jan. 7, 1996. Later life After leaving the Utah governorship Woods moved to California, where he remained for ten years. He then returned to Oregon in 1885, where he died on January 7, 1890.

In 1900, it became a constituent of the University of London. Having played a leading role in the advancement of women in higher education and public life in general, it became fully coeducational (i.e. open to men) in the 1960s. In 1985, Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, another constituent of the University of London, to form Royal Holloway and Bedford New College. This remains the official name, but it is commonly called Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL). History Green plaque at Bedford Square, London The college was founded by Elizabeth Jesser Reid (née Sturch) in 1849, a social reformer and anti-slavery activist, who had been left a private income by her late husband, Dr John Reid, which she used to patronise various philanthropic causes. Mrs Reid and her circle of well- educated friends believed firmly in the need to improve education for women. She leased a house at 47 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury area of London and opened the Ladies College in Bedford Square. The intention was to provide a liberal, non-sectarian education for women, something no other institution in the United Kingdom provided at the time. Reid placed £1,500 (GBP) with three male trustees and persuaded a number of her friends to serve on the management committees and act as teaching professors. In their first year they had nearly 250 pupils. Initially the governance of the College was in the hands of the Ladies Committee (comprising some influential women) and the General Committee made up of the Ladies, the professors of the college and three trustees. The General Committee (later the Council) soon took over the running of the College, while the Ladies Committee directed the work of the Lady Visitors, who were responsible for the welfare and discipline of the students, and acted as their chaperones. Initially the professors were shocked by the generally low educational standards of the women entering the college, who in most cases had had home-based governess education. In response, Reid founded Bedford College School close to the college in 1853 in an attempt to provide a better standard of entrants. In 1860, the college expanded into 48 Bedford Square, which enabled it to become a residential establishment. \\"The Residence\\" was in the charge of a matron, who introduced the practice of students help to run the house and keep their own accounts. =First British institution run by women= Elizabeth Reid died in 1866 and left the college in the hands of three female trustees Eliza Bostock, Jane Martineau and Eleanor Smith. The three of them were concerned that Bedford College School was to become Anglican under the head, Francis Martin. They closed the school although the idea went on without the trustees support as the Gower Street School being led, in time, by Lucy Harrison in 1875. The trustees were the first women to run a British institution. They insisted on a new constitution (as the college had no legal charter at the time). The Council was replaced by a Committee of Management and the college reconstituted as an Association under the Board of Trade and officially became known as Bedford College. In 1874, the Bedford Square lease expired and the college moved to 8 and 9 York Place, off Baker Street. Eliza Bostock was still a trustee but many looked to her as honorary Principal and with her knowledge of building and architecture she organised the college's move to York place. The two houses, 8 and 9, acted as one, with the college using the downstairs rooms and the upstairs being the Residence. As numbers began to rise, the college expanded by adding extensions to house science laboratories. In the late 1870s, an entrance examination was introduced and a preparatory department set up for those who did not meet the standards required for college-level entry. =Women with degrees= In 1878, degree examinations of the University of London were opened to women. Bedford College students began gaining University of London Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science and Master's degrees from the early 1880s. In 1900, when the University of London became a teaching university (where it had previously been only a degree-awarding body), Bedford College became one of its constituent colleges. It applied to the Privy Council for a Royal Charter to take the place of its Deed of Incorporation. Royal Assent for the new chartered body was received in 1909, and the College became officially recognised as Bedford College for Women. Continued growth led to a search for new premises, leading to the purchase of the lease on a site at Regent's Park in 1908. A major fund-raising effort was undertaken to provide it with modern amenities. The purpose-built buildings were designed by the architect Basil Champneys and officially opened by Queen Mary in 1913. The buildings continued to be extended and rebuilt throughout the 70 years that the college spent at Regent's Park, especially after extensive damage from wartime bombing. The college colours were green and grey, said to be those of Minerva. Purple was added in 1938 to represent the university; the resulting colours were, by chance or design, similar to those of women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. Bedford firsts include: *First women to run a British institution. *First Social Sciences department in the UK, established 1918 *First woman appointed to the Companionship of the Order of the Bath *One of the first two women Fellows of the Royal Society *Fourth woman chairman of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Marie Patterson *The first art school in England where women could draw from life After a brief period of admitting a small number of male postgraduate students, the college became fully coeducational when 47 men passed through clearing in 1965, and the name reverted to Bedford College. In the early 1980s, Bedford College had approximately 1,700 students and 200 academic staff based in 20 departments. =Merger with Royal Holloway= In 1985, Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, another college of the University of London which, like Bedford College, had been a college for women only when it was first founded. The merged institution took Royal Holloway College's premises in Egham, Surrey, just outside London, as its main campus and took on the name of Royal Holloway and Bedford New College (RHBNC). The decision to drop the Bedford name from day-to-day use caused some discontent among graduates of Bedford College, who felt that their old college had now essentially been taken over by Royal Holloway, and that Bedford College's name and history as a pioneering institution in the field of women's education were being forgotten. In an attempt to give more prominence to the Bedford name, the merged college named a large, newly built library in the centre of its campus the \\"Bedford Library\\". Relations between RHUL and some of the Bedford College alumni remain somewhat strained, but many other Bedford College alumni maintain links with RHUL, supporting alumni events and other college work. Bedford College's old premises in Regent's Park is now the home of Regent's University London. Notable alumni *Rosetta Delisle, Social Worker *L. D.

In 1920 the British Government decided to site the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, on the site of the pleasure gardens created by Sir Edward Watkin in the 1890s. A British Empire Exhibition had first been proposed in 1902, by the British Empire League, and again in 1913. The Russo- Japanese War had prevented the first plan from being developed and World War I put an end to the second, though there had been a Festival of Empire in 1911, held in part at Crystal Palace.Ian Grosvenor - 'Teaching the Empire: The Weekly Bulletin of Empire Study and the British Empire Exhibition', in Martin Lawn (ed.) - Modelling the Future: Exhibitions and the Materiality of Education (Symposium Books, 2009) p. 107-8 One of the reasons for the suggestion was a sense that other powers were challenging Britain on the world stage. Despite victory in World War I, this was in some ways even truer in 1919. The country had economic problems and its naval supremacy was being challenged by two of its former allies, the USA and Japan. In 1917 Britain had committed itself eventually to leave India, which effectively signalled the end of the British Empire to anyone who thought about the consequences, while the Dominions had shown little interest in following British foreign policy since the war. It was hoped that the Exhibition would strengthen the bonds within the Empire, stimulate trade and demonstrate British greatness both abroad and at home, where the public was believed to be increasingly uninterested in Empire, preferring other distractions, such as the cinema. Wembley Urban District Council were opposed to the idea, as was The Times, which considered Wembley too far from Central London. This sounds ridiculous, especially as the Metropolitan had been electrified by this time, but it has to be remembered that the last exhibition in England, the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908, had been held at White City, a far more central location. A world tour headed by Major Ernest Belcher in 1922 that lasted 10 months was mounted to promote participation in the Exhibition, with Agatha Christie and her husband among the participants.Grand Tour: Letters and Photographs from the British Empire Expedition. HarperCollins, 2012 Belcher delivered a lecture to the Royal Society of Arts about the forthcoming Exhibition in March 1923. See (with map) The British Empire Exhibition would run from 1924 to 1925 and made Wembley a household name. In 1919 the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) had become the President of the organising committee for the proposed Exhibition at Wembley Park, north-west London, although the closing ceremony was presided over by his brother, the future George VI. The Prince, at the time, also wished for the Exhibition to boast \\"a great national sports ground\\", and so exercised some influence on the creation of Wembley Stadium at Wembley Park in 1923.  Empire Stadium  A purpose built “great national sports ground”, called the Empire Stadium, was built for the Exhibition. This became Wembley Stadium. The first turf for this stadium was cut, on the site of the old tower, on 10 January 1922. 250,000 tons of earth were then removed, and the new structure constructed within 10 months, opening well before the rest of the Exhibition was ready. Designed by John William Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton, and built by Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons Ltd, it could hold 125,000 people, 30,000 of them seated. The building was an unusual mix of Roman imperial and Mughal architecture. Although it incorporated a football pitch, it was not solely intended as a football stadium. Its quarter mile running track, incorporating a 220 yard straight track (the longest in the country) were seen as being at least equally important. The only standard gauge locomotive involved in the construction of the Stadium has survived, and still runs on Sir William McAlpine’s private Fawley Hill railway near Henley.  Exhibition Station  Wembley Park station was rebuilt for the British Empire Exhibition and a new station, Exhibition Station (Wembley), was built on a spur to connect the station to Marylebone.Wembley Stadium loop line Exhibition Station opened on 28 April 1923, the day of Wembley Stadium's first FA cup final. It was later renamed Wembley Exhibition, and then, in February 1928, Wembley Stadium. It was only really used to transport spectators to Wembley events. It stopped carrying passengers in May 1968 and officially closed on 1 September 1969.  Design and construction  The Exhibition presented a creative challenge, in that its concept required a large number of buildings in a variety of styles. This offered the architects a unique opportunity to experiment. To simplify construction, the main building material used for the Exhibition buildings was reinforced concrete, (then called “ferro-concrete”), selected for its speed of construction. Wembley Park thus earned the title of the first “concrete city” the world had ever seen. Like the Stadium, the other Exhibition buildings were designed by John William Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton, assisted by engineer Owen Williams. All three had considerable previous experience of using concrete. Nearly 2,000 men were employed in constructing the Exhibition buildings during 1923-4. The Indian pavilion had towers and domes, the West African pavilion looked like an Arab fort, the Burmese pavilion was a temple and the South African building reflected the Dutch style. Aside from the Stadium and major pavilions to house the works of each dominion, colony or group of colonies, there were four other major structures. These were the palaces of Engineering, Industry and Arts, and HM Government Building. All of these palaces can be seen to have had a Roman Imperial character as befitted their political symbolism. At the time, the palaces of Industry and Engineering were world’s largest reinforced concrete structures. The Exhibition’s roads were named by Rudyard Kipling. The site was also served by Britain’s, and possibly the world’s, first bus station, which could handle 100,000 passengers a day.  Opening ceremony  The British Empire Exhibition was officially opened by King George V on 23 April 1924—Saint George's Day. The opening ceremony was broadcast by BBC Radio, the first such broadcast by a British monarch. The King also sent a telegram that travelled around the world in one minute 20 seconds before being given back to him by a messenger boy.  Exhibits  Much of the Empire went on display at Wembley Park, but it had to be, of necessity, reduced to a “taster-sized” version. Of the 58 territories which composed the Empire at the time, 56 participated with displays and pavilions, the exceptions being Gambia and Gibraltar. The Irish Free State did not participate either. The Exhibition's official aim was \\"to stimulate trade, strengthen bonds that bind mother Country to her Sister States and Daughters, to bring into closer contact the one with each other, to enable all who owe allegiance to the British flag to meet on common ground and learn to know each other\\". It cost £12 million and was the largest exhibition ever staged anywhere in the world. It attracted 27 million visitors.Sunday Tribune of India (newspaper) Article on exhibition (2004) Admission cost 1s 6d (7½p) for adults and 9d (3¾p) for children. The Palace of Engineering (in 1925 the Palace of Housing & Transport) was the largest exhibition building. It contained a crane capable of moving 25 tons (a practical necessity, not an exhibit) and contained displays on engineering, shipbuilding, electric power, motor vehicles, railways (including locomotives, see below), metallurgy and telegraphs and wireless. In 1925 there seems to have been less emphasis on things that could also be classified as Industry, with instead more on housing and aircraft. The Palace of Industry was slightly smaller. It contained displays on the chemical industry, coal, metals, medicinal drugs, sewage disposal, food, drinks, tobacco, clothing, gramophones, gas and Nobel explosives. Each colony was assigned its own distinctive pavilion to reflect local culture and architecture. The Canada Pavilion contained displays on minerals, farming, forestry, the paper industry, water power and Canada as a holiday destination, as well as, in the dairy industry section, a full sized figure of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, sculpted in butter and preserved in a refrigerated case. This pavilion was also flanked by smaller pavilions dedicated to the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways. Newfoundland, which did not become part of Canada until 1949, had its own small pavilion next to the HM Government building. The Australian Pavilion boasted a 16-foot diameter ball of Australian wool. Rather smaller was the pavilion shared by the West Indies and British Guiana, south of the HM Government Pavilion. Each of the West Indian islands had a court in the pavilion, as did the Falkland Islands. The Palace of Arts, which was fire- proofed, contained historical room sets, as well as painting and sculpture since the eighteenth century. It also displayed the Queen’s Dolls House, now at Windsor Castle, which even contained miniature bottles of Bass beer. Kiosks, located both inside and outside the pavilions, represented individual companies within the Empire, encouraging commercial opportunities. One such was the Pear's Palace of Beauty (see below). Since the Exhibition was the first major event after the war, many firms produced a glut of commemorative items for sale. The management of the exhibition asked the Imperial Studies Committee of the Royal Colonial Institute to assist them with the educational aspect of the exhibition, which resulted in a 12-volume book, The British Empire: A survey, with Hugh Gunn as the general editor, and which was published in London in 1924.  Railway exhibits  Several railway companies had display stands at the Exhibition; in some cases they exhibited their latest locomotives or coaches. Among the exhibits in the Palace of Engineering was the now famous railway locomotive, LNER 4472 Flying Scotsman; this was joined in 1925 by GWR 4079 Pendennis Castle. Several other railway locomotives were exhibited: in 1925, the Southern Railway exhibited no. 866 of their N class, which was brand new, not entering service until 28 November 1925. The 1924 exhibition included a Prince of Wales class 4-6-0 locomotive of London and North Western Railway (LNWR) design, which had been built for the exhibition by the Scottish locomotive manufacturer William Beardmore & Co. Beardmore's had previously built similar locomotives for the LNWR, which in 1923 had become a constituent of the newly formed London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS); when the exhibition closed in November 1924, the LMS bought the locomotive from Beardmore. A Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway designed Baltic Tank 4-6-4T, number 11114, built by the LMS at Horwich Works new was also on display and featured in postcards.http://thumbs4.picclick.com/d/l400/pict/191827244283_/POSTCARD- LMS-4-6-4T-LOCO-NO-11114-AT-WEMBLEY.jpg In 1924, the Metropolitan Railway displayed one of its latest Inner Circle cars, a first class driving trailer which had been built in 1923. In 1925, in the Palace of Housing and Transport, the Metropolitan displayed electric locomotive no. 15, with some of the panelling, doors and framework removed from one side, to allow the interior to be viewed; it had been built in 1922. A few years later, it was named Wembley 1924 in honour of the exhibition.  Pears' Palace of Beauty  The exhibition grounds contained commercial kiosks, run by newspapers, cigarette companies and other businesses. All these structures were designed by the architect Joseph Emberton and his team. One of the largest kiosks was the Pears’ Palace of Beauty, selling souvenir soaps. It was located in the amusement park. The Palace of Beauty was white with two curved staircases leading up to a domed gazebo supported by columns. It was also an exhibition space containing 10 soundproofed, glass-fronted rooms, each containing an actress/model dressed as a beautiful woman from history, with accompanying reproduction furniture. The ten beauties were Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Scheherazade, Dante’s Beatrice, Elizabeth Woodville, Mary Queen of Scots, Nell Gwyn, Madame de Pompadour, the actress Mrs. Siddons and Miss 1924. There were also two soap-related characters, Bubbles and The Spirit of Purity. The Palace, which charged admission, was open 13 hours a day, so each beauty was depicted by two actresses/models working shifts. 14 of the performers were depicted on souvenir postcards. Nearly 750,000 people visited the Palace.  Other attractions  In addition to the pavilions and kiosks there was a lake, a funfair, a garden and a working replica coal mine. There were also numerous restaurants, the most expensive of which was the Lucullus restaurant (in 1925 the Wembley Garden Club restaurant) near the exhibition gardens. In 1924 J. Lyons held a monopoly of catering, but the restaurant in the Indian Pavilion used Indian cooks and was advised by Edward Palmer \\"of Messrs. Veeraswami [sic] & Co.\\" to serve as \\"Indian Adviser at the restaurant.\\" In 1925 Veeraswamy & Co. ran the Indian restaurant, despite the fact that, for reasons both economic and political, the Indian Government did not take part in the 1925 season. Veeraswamy & Co. later founded the first Indian restaurant aimed at a non-Anglo-Indian white clientele in England. After admission, most of the attractions in the grounds were free. They could also be explored after dark. The various buildings of the site were linked by two 'light railways' of unusual construction, the screw-propelled ‘Never-Stop Railway’.British Film Institute Never-Stop Railway British Pathe (agency) Never-Stop Railway film (probably 1925) and the 'Roadrails' line on which trains were hauled by steam or petrol tractors guided by the rails but with driving wheels running on the ground outside the track. Visitors could also travel in electric ‘Railodok’ buses (little more than basic railway station luggage trolleys fitted with open-sided bodywork, but exciting nonetheless).  Events  The Stadium itself was used extensively for performances by massed bands and choirs, military and historical displays, an Edinburgh-like tattoo, fireworks, the largest ever Boy Scout jamboree, the first Rugby Union match to be played at Wembley, a simulation of an air attack on London (London Defended, see below) and a genuine rodeo which caused some alarm to animal lovers. A highlight was the elaborate \\"Pageant of Empire\\" organised by pageant master Frank Lascelles. This involved thousands of actors and was held in the Empire Stadium from 21 July 1924. The newly appointed Master of the King's Musick, Sir Edward Elgar, composed an \\"Empire March\\" for it and the music for a series of songs with words by Alfred Noyes. London Defended \\"London Defended\\" 1925 Official Programme From 9 May to 1 June 1925, No. 32 Squadron RAF flew an air display six nights a week entitled \\"London Defended\\". Similar to the display they had done the previous year, when the aircraft were painted black, it consisted of a night time air display over the Wembley Exhibition flying RAF Sopwith Snipes which were painted red for the display and fitted with white lights on the wings, tail and fuselage. The display involved firing blank ammunition into the stadium crowds and dropping pyrotechnics from the aeroplanes to simulate shrapnel from guns on the ground, Explosions on the ground also produced the effect of bombs being dropped into the stadium by the Aeroplanes. One of the Pilots in the display was Flying officer C. W. A. Scott who later became famous for breaking three England-Australia solo flight records and winning the MacRobertson Air Race with co-pilot Tom Campbell Black in 1934.Scott, C.W.A.

London: Fleetway Press  Philately and numismatics  The Exhibition is of philatelic interest, as it was the first occasion for which the British Post Office issued commemorative postage stamps. Two stamps were issued on 23 April 1924: a 1d in scarlet, and a d in brown, both being inscribed \\"British Empire Exhibition 1924\\"; they were designed by H. Nelson. A second printing, identical to the first apart from the year being changed to 1925, was issued on 9 May 1925. A List of Great Britain commemorative stamps gives further details of British commemorative postage stamps. Envelopes, letter cards, postcardsWembley British Empire Exhibitions stamps on The British Postal Museum & Archive website and many other souvenirs commemorating the event were produced as well. A significant number of medals were struck for the Exhibition, both by the organisers and by commercial organisations.  Commercial outcome  Despite providing a wealth of entertainment, the Exhibition was not a financial success. Despite 18 million visitors in 1924, the project ended that season without breaking even. In an attempt to raise enough money, the late decision was taken to reopen, with some variations, in 1925, but the Exhibition did not do as well in its second season. It closed for good on 31 October 1925, having received 27 million visitors in two years. The final cost reached in excess of £6 million. Variety claimed that it was the world's biggest outdoor failure, costing the UK Government $90 million (over £20 million based on the exchange rates at the time). Two of the most popular attractions were US dodgem cars and a copy of the tomb of Tutankhamen. Both of these were in the funfair, with the tomb there because Egypt was no longer a British Protectorate, having been independent since 1922. P.G. Wodehouse's fictional Bertie Wooster may have reflected genuine reactions to the Exhibition in preferring the Green Swizzles at the Planters Bar to anything more didactic.  Survival of stadium  Most of the exhibition halls were intended to be temporary and demolished afterwards, but, partly because of the high cost of demolishing such huge concrete structures, the Palace of Engineering and the British Government Pavilion survived into the 1970s, and the Palace of Industry and the sacred art section of the Palace of Arts until the 2010s. At the suggestion of the chair of the exhibition committee, Scotsman Sir James Stevenson, and thanks to the intervention of Arthur Elvin, who had been contracted to clear the exhibition site, the Empire Stadium was retained. It became Wembley Stadium, the home of Football in England until 2003, when it was demolished to be replaced by a new stadium.  Influence on development of Wembley  The British Empire Exhibition inevitably led to increased suburban development. An outfall sewer was built to serve the Exhibition and a number of roads in the area were straightened and widened, and new road signs installed. In addition, new bus services were introduced to serve the Exhibition. Visitors to the Exhibition were introduced to Wembley and some were later encouraged to move to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them. Conversely, though the Exhibition encouraged the development of Wembley as a typical inter-war suburb, the survival of the Stadium ensured that the Empire Exhibition grounds in Wembley Park would remain a major London visitor destination. In popular culture The Exhibition is a key location in the P.G. Wodehouse short story, 'The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy', in which Sir Roderick Glossop describes it as \\"the most supremely absorbing and educational collection of objects, both animate and inanimate, gathered from the four corners of the Empire, that has ever been assembled in England’s history.\\" Bertie Wooster is somewhat less impressed, remarking that \\"millions of people, no doubt, are so constituted that they scream with joy and excitement at the spectacle of a stuffed porcupine-fish or a glass jar of seeds from Western Australia – but not Bertram\\" and sneaks off to the Planters’ Bar in the West Indian section for a Green Swizzle. The British Empire Exhibition features in David Lean’s 1944 film This Happy Breed, starring Celia Johnson. In Sir John Betjeman's celebrated Metro-Land (1973) the poet recalls his childhood experience of the exhibition in the 'Wembley' segment. In Charlie Higson’s Young Bond novel SilverFin (Puffin, 2005), the young James Bond is impressed by the height of the rollercoaster at the British Empire Exhibition in 1925. The Exhibition features in the opening scene of the 2010 film The King's Speech. The film is based on the future George VI's relationship with speech therapist Lionel Logue following his speech at the Exhibition on 31 October 1925, which proved to be highly embarrassing due to his pronounced stammer.

In 2012, after 244 years, Britannica ended the print editions, with the 32 volumes of the 2010 encyclopædia being the last to be printed in the traditional hard-bound volumes. By the time the company had stopped publishing the print editions, their sales only represented about 1% of their business. Since then, Britannica has published the encyclopædia exclusively online. History =Founding years= Front page of volume 3 of the 1778 Encyclopedia Britannica The company was founded in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the 18th century, during the historical period termed the Scottish Enlightenment. Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell began the first edition in 1768. The pair engaged William Smellie, who produced most of the articles in the first edition. The second edition was published in 1784. After Macfarquhar’s death in 1793, Bell became its sole proprietor, and published the third and fourth editions. Archibald Constable, an Edinburgh publisher, published the fifth and sixth editions. When Constable died in 1827, A & C Black Ltd. bought the copyrights to the encyclopædia at auction, and they published it for the next 70 years. Beginning with the ninth edition in 1875, the range of topics were expanded by bringing in contributors from the literary field, social sciences and the scientific community. The ninth edition has since been acknowledged as one of the most impressive collections of scholarship ever produced. In 1901, Horace E. Hooper and Walter M. Jackson purchased all copyrights to the encyclopædia. Hooper and Jackson formed companies in both the United States and England. Hugh Chisholm became the editor for the tenth, eleventh and twelfth editions. =Sears Roebuck ownership= Shipping box for the fourteenth edition In 1915, Sears agreed to market a new and less expensive version of the eleventh edition for middle-class buyers. In 1920, Sears bought Britannica outright, and after only three years of operation, Sears reported a loss of $1.8 million. In 1923, they sold the company back to the widow of Hooper (who had died in 1922) and her brother William Cox. They published the twelfth and thirteenth editions in 1922 and 1926. After Cox failed to raise the money needed to publish the fourteenth edition, Sears ended up financing it, and resumed ownership of Britannica in 1928. In 1932, Sears restructured Britannica, ending sales through their outlets, opting instead for a network of sales representatives who went door-to-door, and staffing booths at conventions and shopping centers. In 1938, Britannica began publishing a yearly synopsis of world events, called the Britannica Book of the Year. =Benton family ownership= In 1941, Britannica was gifted to the University of Chicago by Sears. However, the university didn't believe they could manage the company. William Benton, then vice president of the university, offered to put up the operating capital to protect the university against any losses. Benton bought two‐thirds of the stock, and subsequently bought the remaining third. In 1952, Benton started preparations for the fifteenth edition. Britannica acquired Merriam-Webster in 1964 and Compton's Encyclopedia as well in the early 1960s. Benton died in 1973, before the fifteenth edition was published in 1974. The newly titled Britannica 3, was composed of a ten-volume Micropædia, a 19-volume Macropædia and a one-volume guide to the encyclopædia's use, called Propædia. In 1985, a two-volume index was added, as well as other refinements. Robert P. Gwinn succeeded Benton as publisher and chairman of Britannica in 1974. He divided the company's operations into Britannica USA and Britannica International. In 1990, nearly 120,000 encyclopædias were sold in the United States, with sales for the year rising to $650 million. By 1994, sales had slumped to $453 million, with only 51,000 sets being sold in the states. Sales continued to decline after 1994, finally forcing the company to close more than 70 percent of its sales offices. =Safra ownership= Current location in Chicago In 1996, Britannica was sold to an investment group led by Jacob E. Safra, a Switzerland-based financier. He restructured the company, laying off more than 120 people including many of the company’s top employees. Safra also dissolved the home sales force, with an additional 140 losing their jobs, along with 300 independent contractors. In 1999, they launched Britannica.com, which contained the complete Encyclopædia Britannica. The website repeatedly crashed on its opening day, due to an estimated ten million users who attempted to access the site. After several days of continued problems it was shut down, and restarted a few weeks later with upgraded capacity. Britannica.com laid off 20 percent of its work force one year later. In 2009, Britannica Global Edition was printed with 30 volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles and 8,500 photographs. In 2012, after 244 years, Britannica ended the print editions, with the 32 volumes of the 2010 installment being the last on paper; future editions have been published exclusively online since. In 2018, the company released Britannica Insights, an extension for the Chrome web browser. The extension supplements Google's featured snippets with accurate information. In 2019, in a partnership with Binumi, released a video product that gives schools the opportunity to use millions of royalty-free multimedia clips, to create digital storytelling projects about content they are already teaching.

In ten years in MLS, Kamler scored 12 league goals with 27 assists; half of his goals came in the 2003 season for the Revs. He retired following the 2005 season. He was named MLS Humanitarian of the Year in 2005.

This later line type is most notable on the corners of the stamps where the perforation holes do not line up.

Together with Roald Amundsen he was the first person to reach both the North and South Poles.  Biography  South Pole Medal Oscar Wisting was born in Larvik, in Vestfold county, Norway. He was the son of Ola Martin Olsen Wisting (1843–1927) and Abigael Helene Andersen (1843–85). He became the eldest of 13 children. His father ran a trucking business. At the age of sixteen, he went to sea and in 1892 joined the Royal Norwegian Navy. He was working as a naval gunner at Karljohansvern, the naval base in Horten during 1909 when Roald Amundsen asked him to go north with him on his forthcoming North Pole expedition. Amundsen later secretly changed his plans.Roald Amundsen: The South Pole, An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the \\"Fram\\" 1910 – 1912 Chapter II. From Wisting went to sea believing they were heading for the North Pole. Instead he learned that they were going south to pick up the race with Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole. On 14 December 1911 along with Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Olav Bjaaland and Sverre Hassel, Wisting planted the Norwegian flag on the Geographic South Pole, the first explorers to have reached that point. From 1918 to 1925 Wisting was chief officer on board the Maud in Roald Amundsen's attempt to traverse the Northeast passage. From 1923 to 1925 Wisting more or less acted as leader of the expedition after Amundsen left to try to fly to the pole instead. In 1926 Wisting participated in Amundsen's successful attempt to fly over the North Pole. In the airship Norge they reached the pole on 12 May 1926. The three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole—by Frederick Cook in 1908, Robert Peary in 1909, and Richard E. Byrd in 1926 —are all disputed, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud. Some of those disputing these earlier claims therefore consider the crew of the Norge to be the first verified explorers to have reached the North Pole. In addition Wisting, along with Amundsen, was one of the two first persons who had been to both the North Pole and the South Pole. In later years Oscar Wisting was an active force behind the preparations and building of the Fram Museum in Oslo, a museum built to store and display the polar ship Fram. On 5 December 1936 Wisting was found dead from heart attack in his old bunk on board the Fram, a few days before the 25th anniversary of the successful South Pole expedition.Oscar Wisting (1871–1936) (The Fram Museum) For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition.  Sources  Oscar Wisting wrote about his experiences with Roald Amundsen in 16 år med Roald Amundsen (Oslo: Glydendal Norsk Forlag, 1930). Roald Amundsen wrote about the expedition in Sydpolen published in two volumes in 1912–1913. The work was translated into English by A. G. Chater, and published as The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the \\"Fram\\" 1910–1912.

The novel, published in 1913, a year before the author's death, is somewhat biographical – especially the name of the heroine Yvonne, for whom he had a doomed infatuation in Paris. Fifteen- year-old François Seurel narrates the story of his friendship with seventeen- year-old Augustin Meaulnes as Meaulnes searches for his lost love. Impulsive, reckless and heroic, Meaulnes embodies the romantic ideal, the search for the unobtainable, and the mysterious world between childhood and adulthood. Title The title, , is French for \\"The Great Meaulnes\\". The difficulties in translating the French grand (meaning big, tall, great, etc.) and le domaine perdu (\\"lost estate/domain/demesne\\") have led to a variety of English titles, including The Wanderer, The Lost Domain, Meaulnes: The Lost Domain, The Wanderer or The End of Youth, Le Grand Meaulnes: The Land of the Lost Contentment, The Lost Estate (Le Grand Meaulnes) and Big Meaulnes (Le Grand Meaulnes). It inspired the title of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby. Despite this similarity, French translators struggled the same way to render the word \\"great\\", and chose Gatsby le magnifique (literally Gatsby the Magnificent). Plot summary François Seurel, the 15-year-old narrator of the book, is the son of M. Seurel, who is the director of the mixed-ages school in a small village in the Sologne, a region of lakes and sandy forests in the heartland of France. François is intrigued when 17-year-old Augustin Meaulnes, a bright young man from a modest background arrives at the school. Because of his tallness, Augustin acquires the nickname \\"grand\\". He becomes a hero figure to the class and runs away one evening on an escapade where, after having become lost, he chances on a magical costume party where he is enchanted by the girl of his dreams, Yvonne de Galais. She lives with her widowed father and her somewhat odd brother Frantz in a vast and ancient family château – Les Sablonnières – which has seen better days. The party was being held to welcome Frantz and the girl he was to marry, Valentine. However when she does not appear, Frantz attempts suicide but fails. After returning to school, Meaulnes has only one idea: to find the mysterious château again and the girl with whom he has now fallen in love. However his local searches fail while at the same time a bizarre young man shows up at the school. It is Frantz de Galais under a different name trying to escape the pain of having been rejected. Frantz, Meaulnes, and François become friends, and Frantz gives Meaulnes the address of a house in Paris where he says Meaulnes will find his sister, Yvonne de Galais. Meaulnes leaves for Paris only to learn no one lives in the house anymore. He writes to his friend François Seurel: \\"...it is better to forget me. It would be better to forget everything\\". François Seurel, who has now become a school teacher like his father, finally manages to find Yvonne de Galais and reunites her with Meaulnes. Yvonne still lives with her aging father in what is left of the old family estate, \\"Les Sablonnières\\", which is closer than the two young friends had first imagined in earlier years. Yvonne de Galais is still single and confesses to Meaulnes that he is and has always been the love of her life. Yvonne de Galais accepts, with her father's blessings, Augustin Meaulnes' marriage proposal. However, the restless Meaulnes leaves Yvonne the day after their wedding in order to find her lost brother Frantz (to whom he had once promised to help) and re- unite him with his fiancée Valentine. Yvonne remains at the château, where she gives birth to a little girl but dies two days later. Eventually François lives in the house Meaulnes and Yvonne lived in and raises the little girl there, while waiting for the return of his friend Meaulnes. While looking through old papers François discovers a handwritten diary by Meaulnes. During the years in Paris (before François brought Meaulnes and Yvonne back together), Meaulnes had met and romanced Valentine, the fiancée who had jilted Frantz on the night of the party. Meaulnes does return, after a year and eight months, having brought Frantz and Valentine back together. He discovers that Yvonne has died and left a daughter, whom he claims. Four years have elapsed since the beginning of the story.

Kessenich is a village in the Belgian province Limburg. It is a section of the municipality of Kinrooi, lying in the eastern end of the municipality. Geography Kessenich is the end of the Grensmaas, the part of the Meuse who forms a natural border with the Dutch province Limburg. This river separates Kessenich from Stevensweert. In the north lie the Dutch villages of Thorn, Ittervoort and Neeritter. In the south lies Maaseik. The region of Kessenich is dissected by several rivers: the Abeek, the Itterbeek and Witbeek on their way to the Meuse. East of Kessenich is an area with several ponds, the Maasplassen. They were created by large-scale exploitation of gravel from 1949. The gravel layer with a thickness of up to 10 m, was deposited by the Meuse, which repeatedly moved to the east. In May 2008 ended the gravel mining and began the partial attenuation of the lakes. Now, some Maasplassen are equipped for recreation or nature. Name Its name is derived from the Gallo-Roman Cassiniacum. Kessenich is also named as Kesnic (1102), Kasnech (1132), Casselin or Cassenic (1155), Kessenich (1219) and Cessenic (1224). Later, it's also identified on maps as Kessingen (1573)the map from 1573 by Christian Sgroten and Kesnick (1754).the map from 1754 by Rumsey dVaugondy In Limburgish it's still called 'Kesing'. History Kessenich is the oldest of the five villages of Kinrooi. It was founded as a Celtic settlement, then close to the Meuse. That has been shifted to the east and left north of the village a bogged arm behind. This marsh, the Vijverbroek, made in the Middle age as redoubt. According to a legend had between Kessenich and Thorn drowned the village Vijvere. Now it is a unique area overgrown with alder and other tree and plant species. Remains of a prehistoric settlement have been found on the Boterakker, southern of the village. Other prehistoric finds have been made on the Hezerheide, western of the village. There were also found Roman catacombs (Molenwegske) and a Roman road (near the limit). This Roman road connected Maastricht and Nijmegen and had here a width of 12 m. After the destruction of the Western Roman Empire there has been formed a shire, extending Kessnich, Thorn, Aldeneik and some other villages. Ansfried of Utrecht might have been the last count of this area, because in that period the shire suddenly fall apart. Finally, the area was divided into three parts; Thorn, Aldeneik and Kessenich. Thorn and Aldeneik became important abbeys, Kessenich was lying between both. So there was a major influence of those abbeys. Kessenich became an imperial free city, since the 14th century united with the county Bronshorn (Hunsel). The county of Kessenich was governed out of a Motte-and-bailey, built as protection against the pillaging Vikings, who even Maastricht, Tongeren and Aachen have reached via the Meuse, and the many floods of the Meuse. From the tower on the 10 meters high artificial hill are ruins remaining. The new castle has been built in the 17th century, by the family Van Waes. The hamlet where the castle is, lies nearby Neeritter, so it's called Borgitter. In the 18th century was Kessenich like whole Limburg the battlefield of the various wars. When the Dutch-British troops withdrew from the region under the leadership of the Duke of Malborough during the Spanish Succession War, Kessenich was plundered in 1714, besieged the castle and the countess captured. In the whole region is still the annually tradition to burn a straw doll, which the Duke of Marlborough should propose. In 1795, the French annexed also Kessenich and divided it into the department Meuse- Inférieure. The estates of the counts Van Waes were sold by the Frenchmen to the family Michiels. One of their descendants was Willem Michiels of Kessenich, who was mayor of Maastricht from 1937 till 1967. After Napoleon's defeat with the Battle of Waterloo, all countries of the Benelux were united into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the department became the Province of Limburg. The anthem of this province is written in Neeritter. In 1839, the province is divided with de Meuse as limit into a Belgian and a Dutch part.

The range is never more than from the coast.Big Sur: Images of America, Jeff Norman, Big Sur Historical Society, Arcadia Publishing (2004), 128 pages, The range forms the steepest coastal slope in the contiguous United States. Cone Peak at tall and three miles (5 km) from the coast, is the highest peak in proximity to the ocean in the lower 48 United States. The range was a barrier to exploring the coast of central California for early Spanish explorers.  Geography  The Santa Lucia Mountains are part of the Outer South California Coast Ranges, in the Pacific Coast Ranges System. The coastal side of the range rises directly from the shoreline, with oceanfront ridges rising directly to the crest of the coastal range. The crest of the range is never more than from the coast. Cone Peak is the steepest coastal elevation in the contiguous United States,. rising nearly a mile (1,609 m) above sea level, only three miles (5 km) from the Pacific Ocean. The range's northern section runs parallel to the southern section of the Diablo Range, part of the Inner South Coast Ranges, which lies to the east across the Salinas Valley. The range's highest summit is Junipero Serra Peak, in Monterey County and the Los Padres National Forest. =Major peaks= * Junipero Serra Peak, . * Cone Peak, . * Ventana Double Cone, . * Mount Carmel, .  History and toponymy  The first European to document the Santa Lucias was Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542 while sailing northward along the coast on a Spanish naval expedition. Cabrillo originally named the southern portion of the range the Sierras de San Martín, as he was passing the area on 11 November, the feast day for Saint Martin. He named the northern part Sierras Nevadas because there was snow on it. The present name for the range was documented in 1602 by Sebastián Vizcaíno, who had been tasked by the Spanish to complete a detailed chart of the coast. Passing by the range on 14 December, he named the range Sierra de Santa Lucia in honor of Saint Lucy of Syracuse. The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, camped on the coast near Ragged Point in present-day San Luis Obispo County on September 13, 1769. The expedition was forced to bypass the inaccessible coast and travel inland through the San Antonio Valley. The rough trail required much improvement by the scouts, and it was September 24 before the party emerged from the mountains at the San Antonio River near today's settlement of Jolon. They traveled north through the Salinas Valley before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it their capital. (This book also contains a translation of Crespi's diary from the Fages 1772 expedition.)  Natural history  = Climate = Like other Pacific Coast Ranges, the mountains' close proximity to the Pacific Ocean cause moisture to be deposited on the west-facing slopes, creating a suitable environment for conifers. This creates a rain shadow over Salinas Valley to the east, which is considerably drier. The higher peaks receive some snowfall during the winter. The climate is classified as dry summer subtropical, or Mediterranean. Rainfall varies from throughout the range. Most of the precipitation falls during the winter on the higher mountains in the north. During the summer, fog and low clouds are frequent along the coast up to an elevation of 2–3,000 feet. Surface runoff from rainfall is rapid, and many streams dry up entirely in the summer, except for some perennial streams in the wetter areas in the north. = Flora = The western slopes of the range facing the Pacific Ocean are moist with healthy forest growth; including coast redwood, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, Pacific madrone and the local endemics Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata) and Gowen cypress (Cupressus goveniana var. goveniana). The east side is drier, with chaparral and open woods of pine (including Coulter pine and gray pine) and oak woodlands of several Quercus species. These mountains are home to the southernmost native stands of coast redwood trees, since the climate gets drier towards the south. This range is the only known habitat of the Vortriede's spineflower.  Geology  Junipero Serra Peak The rock of the Santa Lucias is dominated by granitic basement of the Salinian Block, between the San Andreas Fault and Sur-Nacimiento Fault. The core of the Salinian block formed as part of the same batholith which forms the core of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Peninsular Ranges of Baja California. It was separated from the North American Plate and transported north by the action of the San Andreas Fault from an original position. It is predominantly Mesozoic granitic and pre-Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. There is some Cretaceous sedimentary rock of the Great Valley Sequence, considerable Miocene marine sediments, and some other Cenozoic sediments. Units west of the Sur-Nacimiento Fault are dominated by rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage. The basement rocks of the Santa Lucia Range contain Mesozoic Franciscan and Salinian Block rocks. The Franciscan complex is composed of greywacke sandstone and greenstone, with serpentinite bodies and other Ultramafic rocks present. Small areas of marble and limestone lenses form resistant outcrops that are prominent landscape features, often white to light gray in color. The Salinian block is made up of highly fractured, and deeply weathered meta-sediments, especially biotite schist and gneiss, intruded by plutonic (granitic) rocks such as quartz diorite and granodiorite. Both formations have been disrupted and tectonically slivered by motion on the San Andreas and associated fault systems. The Palo Colorado and Church Creek faults are prominent features influencing the linear northwest–southeast alignment of primary drainages. The Palo Colorado-San Gregorio fault system transitions onshore at Doud Creek, about south of Point Lobos, exposing the western edge of the Salinian block. Stream canyons frequently follow the north-westerly trending fault lines, rather than descending directly to the coast. The Salinian block is immediately south of the Monterey Submarine Canyon, one of the largest submarine canyon systems in the world, which is believed to have been an ancient outlet for the Colorado River. The region is also traversed by the Sur-Hill fault, which is noticeable at Pfeiffer Falls in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. The waterfall were formed when the stream flowed over the hard gneiss of the Salinian block and encountered the softer Santa Margarita Sandstone. The falls were formed when the softer sandstone was worn away. The interior canyons are typically deep and narrow, and even in the summer sunshine only reaches many of the canyon bottoms for a few hours. The land is mostly steep, rocky, semi-arid except for the narrow canyons, and inaccessible. The Little Sur River canyon is characteristic of the Ventana Wilderness region: steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating valleys. At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest sand dunes on the Big Sur coast. About 50 streams flow out of the mountains into the sea. A few of them, including the Big Sur and Little Sur Rivers, Big Creek, Garrapata Creek, and Salmon Creek, are large enough to support anadromous and resident fish.  Transportation  California State Route 1 runs along the Big Sur coast on the coastal slopes of the range, while U.S. Route 101 lies in the Salinas Valley to the East. The only road across the Santa Lucia Range is Nacimiento-Fergusson Road, connecting Lucia to Jolon.; .  Contemporary history  Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 crashed in the mountains near Cayucos on December 7, 1987 after a gunman killed both pilots, causing the aircraft to crash. A total of 43 people were killed with no survivors. = Wine = The Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, an American Viticultural Area and producer of California wine, is located on the southeastern slopes of the mountains, above the Salinas valley. = Winds = Like well known cousin Santa Ana winds or Sundowner of Santa Barbara, Santa Lucia's Cuesta Grade on Highway 101 has potential to produce some powerful katabatic winds, in 3 hours temperatures have been recorded to jump 40 degrees F towards 110 F.

It is also known as the Palestine yellow scorpion, Omdurman scorpion, Naqab desert scorpion and by many other colloquial names, which generally originate from the commercial captive trade of the animal. To eliminate confusion, especially important with potentially dangerous species, the scientific name is normally used to refer to them. The name Leiurus quinquestriatus roughly translates into English as \\"five-striped smooth-tail\\". In 2014, the subspecies L. q. hebraeus was separated from it and elevated to its own species Leiurus hebraeus.Lowe G, Yagmur EA, Kovarik F. A Review of the Genus Leiurus Ehrenberg, 1828 (Scorpiones: Buthidae) with Description of Four New Species from the Arabian Peninsula. Euscorpius. 2014 (191):1-129. PDF. Other species of the genus Leiurus are also often referred to as \\"deathstalkers\\".  Description  Leiurus quinquestriatus is yellow, and long, with an average of .  Geographic range  Leiurus quinquestriatus can be found in desert and scrubland habitats ranging from North Africa through to the Middle East. Its range covers a wide sweep of territory in the Sahara, Arabian Desert, Thar Desert, and Central Asia, from Algeria and Mali in the west through to Egypt, Ethiopia, Asia Minor and the Arabian Peninsula, eastwards to Kazakhstan and western India in the northeast and southeast.  Venom  A deathstalker eating a cricket in captivity Neurotoxins in L. quinquestriatus venom include: * Chlorotoxin * Charybdotoxin * Scyllatoxin * Agitoxins types one, two and three =Hazards= The deathstalker is one of the most dangerous species of scorpions.\\"The World’s Most Dangerous Scorpions\\" Planet Deadly.\\"Not so scary scorpions\\" National Science Foundation. Its venom is a powerful mixture of neurotoxins, with a low lethal dose. While a sting from this scorpion is extraordinarily painful, it normally would not kill a healthy adult human. However, young children, the elderly, or infirm (such as those with a heart condition and those who are allergic) are at much greater risk. Any envenomation runs the risk of anaphylaxis, a potentially life- threatening allergic reaction to the venom. A study from Israel shows a high rate of pancreatitis following envenomation. If a sting from Leiurus quinquestriatus does prove deadly, the cause of death is usually pulmonary edema. Antivenom for the treatment of deathstalker envenomations is produced by pharmaceutical companies Twyford (German) and Sanofi Pasteur (French), and by the Antivenom and Vaccine Production Center in Riyadh. Envenomation by the deathstalker is considered a medical emergency even with antivenom treatment, as its venom is unusually resistant to treatment and typically requires large doses of antivenom. In the United States and other countries outside of the typical range of the deathstalker, there is the additional complicating factor that none of the existing antivenoms are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (or equivalent agencies) and are only available as investigational drugs (INDs). The US Armed Forces maintain an investigational drug application for the AVPC-Riyadh antivenom in the event of envenomation of soldiers in the Gulf War theater of operations, and the Florida Antivenin Bank, managed by the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, maintains Sanofi Pasteur's Scorpifav antivenom for the deathstalker. =Uses= Deathstalker in Negev Desert, Israel. A component of the deathstalker's venom, the peptide chlorotoxin, has shown potential for treating human brain tumors. There has also been some evidence to show that other components of the venom may aid in the regulation of insulin and could be used to treat diabetes. In 2015 clinical trials were beginning of the use of chlorotoxin with a fluorescent molecule attached as brain tumour \\"paint\\" (BLZ-100), to mark cancerous cells in real time during an operation. This is important in brain cancer surgery, where it is vital both to remove as many cancerous cells as possible, but not to remove healthy tissue necessary for brain functioning. In preclinical animal trials the technique could highlight extremely small clusters of as few as 200 cancer cells, compared to the standard use of MRI, with a lower limit in excess of 500,000.  Legality  Possession of L.quinquestriatus may be illegal or regulated in countries with laws prohibiting the keeping of dangerous animals in general. Jurisdictions are increasingly and explicitly including L.quinquestriatus in laws requiring permits to keep animals which are not usual pets, or restricting possession of dangerous animals, and in some cases have prohibited the keeping of L.quinquestriatus save by licensed zoos and educational facilities. In several jurisdictions departments of fish and wildlife require permits for many animals,In the UK a licence is required under the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act and a number of cities and municipal governments have prohibited their possession in their bylaws.

It is also the highest peak in Monterey County. It is named after Franciscan Friar Junípero Serra, founder of the California Missions.  Toponymy  It was originally named Santa Lucia Peak, as it is the highest point in the range of the same name. Wanting to honor Junípero Serra, the Native Daughters of the Golden West had bestowed his name upon a Sierra Nevada peak in June 1905. However, the Sierra Club recommended that the name be transferred to Santa Lucia Peak. The United States Board on Geographic Names officially approved the name change in 1906 finding that Junípero Serra was familiar with the Santa Lucia Mountains, but in all likelihood he had never encountered the Sierra Nevada. The peak is also sometimes called Pimkolam, its ancient Salinan Native American name.  Climate  Since the peak is over 5,000 feet (1,500 m), temperatures in winter are low enough to support snowfall and relatively high amounts of precipitation compared to the Salinas Valley and places farther east in the Coast Ranges.

He participated in three of the polar expeditions led by Roald Amundsen and was one of the first five explorers to reach the South Pole.  Background Helmer Hanssen was born in Bjørnskinn, on the island of Andøya in Nordland, Norway. He was an experienced ice pilot, a skill he had learned while hunting around Spitsbergen. Between 1894 and 1897, he hunted small whales and seals in the Arctic Sea. He later sailed for the Norwegian shipping company, Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab.  Career  From 1903 to 1905 Helmer Hanssen participated in Roald Amundsen's successful search for the Northwest Passage, as second mate on board the ship Gjøa. On the expedition he learned from the Inuit how to drive sled dogs. In 1910 he headed south with Amundsen to conquer the South Pole, this time as an expert dog driver. He was also in charge of navigation, carrying the master compass on his sledge. South Pole Medal He was one of the first five people to reach the South Pole on 14 December 1911, along with Roald Amundsen, Olav Bjaaland, Oscar Wisting, and Sverre Hassel. During their stay at the South Pole, it is estimated that Hanssen passed within 200 yards (180 meters) of the mathematical South Pole point. This was during one of his ski runs which Amundsen had ordered be performed to completely encircle or \\"box\\" the pole, to ensure that there was no doubt that the expedition had attained the pole. For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition. In 1919 he once again went north, this time as captain on Maud in Roald Amundsen's Northeast Passage expedition. Helmer Hanssen was awarded the Knight of St. Olav for exceptional seamanship on Roald Amundsen's expeditions in the northern and southern parts of the world. In 1936 Hanssen published his autobiography The Voyages of a Modern Viking, (London: G. Routledge & Sons Limited, 1936).

The campus includes a museum with changing exhibits, the historic home called Oakhurst, many themed gardens, outdoor sculptures and a portion of the White River Greenway. It is located in the Minnetrista Boulevard Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Located on the grounds, visitors can tour George Alexander Ball's house, known as Oakhurst, which was built in 1895 and designed by architect Louis Gibson. The first floor is furnished to appear as it did in the 1920s. Visitors can also tour the grounds that feature many outdoor sculptures purchased by members of the Ball family. There are many themed gardens, which include: * Nature Area - three representations of Indiana native habitat, a pond, woodland and prairie * Oakhurst Gardens - located by the Oakhust house, features a formal garden, sunken gardens, woodland gardens and courtyard garden * Wishing Well Garden - designed in 2000 by the Delaware Master Gardeners, features themes of Four Seasons, Moon and Bird & Butterfly gardens * Rose Garden * Backyard Garden, formerly the Children's Gardens which was renovated in 2012 * Colonnade Garden * Orchard Courtyard - a seasonal container garden display Background In 1887, the Ball family moved their glass manufacturing company from Buffalo, New York to Muncie, Indiana. Ball Brothers Glass Company became one of America's best- known manufacturers of canning jars. The family purchased most of the land along the north bank of the White River in 1893. They committed themselves to community projects that would improve the quality of life for East Central Indiana residents. An unfortunate event, the burning of one of the Ball family homes in the late 1960s served as an inspiration for the second generation of the Ball family. That inspiration would eventually blossom into more than they ever imagined: A place for lifelong learning. The word \\"Minnetrista\\" means \\"a gathering place by the water\\", and was the name of the original home built by Frank Clayton Ball in 1894, which burned in 1967. The Ball family created the word from the Sioux word \\"mna\\" which means \\"water\\" combined with the English word \\"tryst\\". Layers of Minnetrista The Minnetrista Cultural Center was built on the same site in 1988.  Collections  More than 10,000 square feet of behind-the-scenes space at the Minnetrista is devoted to the preservation of the artifacts and archival material that documents the history of East Central Indiana. There are more than 15,000 objects within the museum's collection that include artifacts and archival materials such as photographs, diaries, clothing, quilts, furniture, locally manufactured products, and more. A selection of the objects and archival records are now available online. Currently, the records accessible include: postcards, photographs, objects, and over 2,300 book catalog records. Some of the topics included are Muncie Pottery, the Ball Corporation, Ball family, business, clubs and organizations, gardening, collectibles, and artwork. The library and archives are open to the public.  Family Fun  The Minnetrista has events for the whole family that includes the Imagination Playground, Explorer Bags that allows visitors to explore and great their own adventure, step into the past and play in Betty's Doll House and Cabin, and special Saturday events. The Minnetrista has four annual events: Garden Fair in the spring, Faeries, Sprites, and Lights in July; Summer Stage Fest at various times throughout the summer, and Enchanted Luminaria Walk the first weekend of December. In addition, Minnetrista hosts a Farmers Market that draws 45,000 visitors each year. Throughout the year, the Minnetrista holds various workshops such as a glass workshop and a canning workshop.  Adult Programs  The Minnetrista also has specific adult programing such as Senior Free Admission Day, Tea and Talk where specific topics are covered like Women's Suffrage, adult workshops, and After Hours themed events. Natural beauty Minnetrista has acres of formal and natural gardens, an expansive restored natural area that includes interpretive signs, ponds, and hiking trails. Minnetrista is currently working to create a comprehensive GIS-based map of the entire campus, including a detailed database of the plants available. This project is a partnership between the Horticulture Department at Minnetrista, the Delaware County Office of Geographic Information, and Ball State University (providing internship positions through the Landscape Architecture, Natural Resources, Geography, or Biology Departments).

Biography Melas was born in Marseilles, France, the son of Michail Melas who was elected MP for Attica and mayor of Athens and brother of Vassileios Melas who was also an officer of the Hellenic Army. His father, a wealthy merchant, was of Epirote origin. At an early age Pavlos moved to Athens to study, and later joined the Army, graduating from the Hellenic Army Academy as an artillery lieutenant in 1891. In 1892, he married Natalia Dragoumi, the daughter of Kastorian politician Stephanos Dragoumis and sister of Ion Dragoumis. In 1895, the couple had a son named Michael and a daughter, Zoe. Melas, with the cooperation of his brother- in-law Ion Dragoumis, the consul of Greece in the then Ottoman occupied Monastir (now Bitola), Christos Kottas, and Germanos Karavangelis, metropolitan bishop of Kastoria, tried to raise money for the economic support of Greek efforts in Macedonia. After the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising, he decided to enter Macedonia in June 1904, to assess the situation and to see if there is any possibility of establishing a military unit to fight the Bulgarians (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, VMRO) and the Ottoman Turks. In July 1904 (under the alias \\"Captain Mikis Zezas\\", Καπετάν Μίκης Ζέζας), he reentered Macedonia with a small unit of men and fought against the VMRO until October 13, 1904 when he was killed after being surrounded by Ottoman forces in the village of Statista. The village with coordinates 40° 42' N 021° 16' E has been renamed Melas in his honour, after joining Greece. After his death, Greek efforts became more intense, resulting in the interception of Bulgarian Komitadji efforts, especially in West and Central Macedonia, which was annexed by Greece after the Balkan Wars. He is considered to be a symbol of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia and many of his personal belongings can be seen in the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Thessaloniki and Pavlos Melas Museum in Kastoria.

It forms part of the watershed of the Hyeongsan River, which flows north through the basin where it is joined by the Bukcheon, Namcheon, Daecheon, and Sogyeon-cheon streams. The basin is surrounded by low mountains, most of which are also part of Gyeongju National Park. Specifically, it is bordered by Gowi Mountain (495 m above sea level) on the south, Seondo Mountain (380 m) and Ongnyeo Peak (215 m) on the west, and Gumi Mountain (594 m) on the north. Namsan, a mountain composed of two peaks (466 m, 495 m), cuts the Gyeongju Basin into two parts at the southern end. The streams that flow from these mountains have formed a number of interlinked alluvial plains in the Basin. The city center of Gyeongju, which was also the capital of the ancient Silla kingdom, occupies much of the basin. Various watershed management projects were undertaken even during Silla times, due to continuous flooding in the basin, caused by runoff from the neighboring mountains combined with inflow from the upper Hyeongsan River watershed. The most recent severe flood took place in 1991. The basin is also home to a great number of important Korean cultural heritage assets, mostly related to its ancient role as capital of Silla. For example, the royal tombs of Silla are located there, as is the Gyerim forest. The slopes of the entire Namsan Mountain are covered in religious and ceremonial sites dating from the Mumun Pottery Period (c. 1500-300 B.C.) to the end of the Korean Three Kingdoms (c. AD 668). Namsan and environs is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Agriculture is also undertaken on a significant scale within the basin. The crops are primary staples such as rice, barley, and soybeans. The Gyeongju strain of rice grown here is particularly famous for its quality. However, the Gyeongju Basin has undergone significant environmental strain since the 1970s resulting the construction of tourist facilities, the expansion and industrialization of urban Gyeongju, intensive agriculture, and the construction and use of national public infrastructure such as expressways, highways, and high-speed rail.

Biography  Sverre Hassel was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. As soon as he was old enough, he went to sea, earning his mate's certificate. Between 1898 and 1902, Hassel participated on board the Fram in Otto Sverdrup's attempt to circumnavigate Greenland. South Pole Medal Along with Helmer Hanssen, Hassel was picked as an expert dog driver to take part in Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition 1910 – 1912. On 14 December 1911, Hassel together with Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Olav Bjaaland and Oscar Wisting were the first to reach the South Pole. For his participation in the expedition, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), the Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition. Hassel was constable of the Maritime Military Corps in 1904 before he was hired as an assistant at the customs authorities in Kristiansand. In 1922, Hassel became customs inspector and office manager in Grimstad. Sverre Hassel died in 1928 during a visit to Amundsen's home in Svartskog.

The main component of the rear suspension of most modern motorbikes and ATVs, it holds the rear axle firmly, while pivoting to absorb bumps and suspension loads induced by the rider, acceleration, and breaking. Originally motorcycles had no rear suspension, as their frames were little more than stronger versions of the classic diamond frame of a bicycle. Many types of suspension were tried, including Indian's leaf spring suspended swingarm, and Matchless's cantilevered coiled-spring swingarm. Immediately before and after World War II, the plunger suspension, in which the axle moved up and down two vertical posts, became commonplace. In the latter, the movement in each direction was against coiled springs. Some manufacturers, such as Greeves, used swingarm designs for the front forks, which were more robust than telescopic forks. In particular, sidecar motocross outfits frequently use swing arm front forks. The swingarm has also been used for the front suspension of scooters. In this case it aids in simplifying maintenance. In motorcycles with shaft drive, such as the Yamaha XJ650 Maxim, the shaft housing forms the left side swingarm. Yamaha XJ650 Maxim has a driveshaft forming the left swingarm Swingarm types Swingarms can be single or double sided, and have appeared in a variety of geometrys. Many single-sided also incorporate the driveshaft. Swinging fork - the original version consisting of a pair of parallel pipes holding the rear axle at one end and pivoting at the other. A pair of shock absorbers are mounted just before the rear axle and attached to the frame, below the seat rail. Cantilever - An extension of the swinging fork where a triangulated frame transfers swingarm movement to compress shock absorber/s generally mounted in front of the swingarm. The HRD- Vincent Motorcycle is a famous early form of this type of swingarm, though Matchless used it earlier, and Yamaha subsequently. The Harley-Davidson Softail is another form of this swingarm, though working in reverse, with the shock absorbers being extended rather than compressed. Moto Guzzi's CRDS variant of the parallelogram Parallelogram - Was first introduced commercially in 1985 on the Magni \\"Le Mans\\". Magni called the system Parallelogrammo. Various parallelogram systems have been developed by other manufacturers. Whereas downward generated mechanical forces would cause a chain-driven bike to \\"squat\\" at the rear under acceleration, the torque reaction of a shaft drive machine would induce the opposite, causing the seat (and rider) to rise upwards, a phenomenon known as \\"shaft-jacking\\". This anti-intuitive sensation can be disconcerting to riders, which parallelogram suspensions seek to neutralize. BMW's Paralever rear suspension on a 2015 R1200RT BMW introduced its Paralever system on its 1988 R80GS and R100GS motorcycles, which adds a second link between the rear drive and transmission to allow the driveshaft to pivot along the same axis as the sprung rear frame. Moto Guzzi patented its Compact Reactive Drive Shaft system (Ca.R.C.), where the driveshaft is free to float into its structure, providing much softer feedback from transmission. An upper arm serves as a guide to close the geometry of the suspension. Extended swingarms - are often used by drag racing motorcycles (called dragbikes) to keep their center of gravity as forward as possible, which reduces the tendency to wheelie at the start. Single-sided swingarm - a suspension lying along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing it to be mounted to a hub like a car wheel. Also found on scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and rear wheel, single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer and more heavily built than double-sided, to accommodate the extra torsional forces. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment. Single-sided swingarms date from at least the late 1940s. In 1948, the Imme R100 produced by Norbert Riedel of Germany had both a single-sided front wheel suspension as well as a single-sided rear swingarm that doubled as the exhaust pipe. In 1950 Moto Guzzi introduced the Galletto, a large-wheel step-through scooter. In 1980, BMW introduced its first single-sided swingarm on the R80G/S, the \\"Mono-lever\\", which was superseded by the \\"Para-lever\\" used currently. Honda currently features this style of swingarm on the Honda VFR. Ducati has created several models featuring single swingarms, most notably the Massimo Tamburini-designed 916 series. While Ducati abandoned this style for the 999, the company returned to it for the 1098 superbike in 2007, and it survives in the current Ducati 1199. The Triumph Sprint ST and Speed Triple also feature single-sided swingarms.http://www.triumphmotorcycles.co.uk/motorcycles/range/touring/sprint/2011/sprint- st =Images= File:Lambretta Model C 123cc 2 swingarm closeup.JPGalt=The image shows the starboard side (right side when facing forward) of the suspension of a Lambretta Model C.

File:SprintST.jpgTriumph Sprint ST with single-sided swingarm. Squat and Shaft-jacking \\"Squat\\" occurs because the top of the final drive chain run pulls the swingarm upwards; \\"Shaft-jacking\\" occurs because the shaft drive bevel gear tries to \\"climb up\\" the large bevel gear in the wheel hub, thereby pushing the swingarm downwards and away from the frame.\\"Motorcycle Handling and Chassis Design: The Art and Science\\" -Tony Foal Shaft-jacking can be minimised by devices such as parallelogram swingarms. A practical way to minimise squat on a chain-drive bike is to locate the final drive sprocket as close as possible to the axis of the swingarm pivot; the ideal solution is to make the final drive sprocket and the swingarm pivot concentric, as was done on the Hesketh V1000.

The Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Until 2011 it was known as the Football Licensing Authority, having been set up under the Football Spectators Act 1989. The SGSA was established through the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011, which received royal assent in July 2011 and commenced on 1 November 2011. The aim of the SGSA is to ensure that all spectators regardless of age, gender, ethnic origin, disability, or the team that they support are able to attend sports grounds in safety, comfort and security. Creation The Football Licensing Authority was originally conceived as the body that would implement the Football Membership Scheme in response to the disaster at the Heysel Stadium in 1985. However, the Government shelved this in the light of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report on the Hillsborough disaster of April 1989. Instead it was eventually charged with implementing some of the Report's key recommendations by: * monitoring local authorities' oversight of spectator safety at international, Premiership and Football League grounds * and ensuring through a system of licensing that these grounds became all seated. In 1992 the Government of the United Kingdom decided to allow clubs in the Football League Second and Third Divisions to retain some standing accommodation, provided that this satisfied certain criteria. The FLA enforced this through their licensing scheme. Key objectives The FLA had agreed the following key objectives with the United Kingdom Government: * To ensure by means of guidance, assistance and monitoring that the local authorities perform their functions to a consistent and acceptable standard; and, in the long term, to give these authorities the opportunity to reduce their level of involvement as clubs take greater responsibility for safety. * To maintain and build on the achievements of the government’s policies on spectator accommodation. * To bring about, through advice and persuasion, a permanent change of culture whereby consistently high standards of safety are maintained at every Premiership, Football League and international football ground by the clubs or ground management taking responsibility on their own initiative rather than in response to requirements imposed by other bodies. * To maintain and enhance its position as the leading authority on ground safety and standards both at home and overseas and as the prime source of advice and assistance to the government, local authorities, clubs and other bodies. Wider role In December 1998, following a major review, the Government of the United kingdom announced that the FLA would in due course become the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. It presented legislation to this effect to Parliament but the 2001 General Election intervened. Ministers were committed to reintroducing it when they could find a place in the Parliamentary timetable, but failed to do so. Although the formal role of the FLA was limited to professional football grounds, they did respond to requests for general advice and information in relation to other sporting venues – where the issues and needs are often the same. Change from Football Licensing Authority to Sports Grounds Safety Authority On 14 October 2010 it was announced that the FLA was one of the 192 Quangos to be axed by Her Majesty's Government, with its expertise and functions transferred to another body. On 12 July 2011 the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Act 2011 received royal assent. The Act transformed the Football Licensing Authority into the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. On 10 November 2014 it was announced that the Sports Grounds Safety Authority will be retained as an Independent body.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/372212/Annex_- _Updated_list_of_public_bodies.pdf See also * Hillsborough disaster * Taylor Report * Green Guide * Terrace (stadium) * All-seater stadium * Premier League References External links *Official website Football in England Football in Wales Non-departmental public bodies of the United Kingdom government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport 2011 establishments in the United Kingdom Sports organisations of the United Kingdom ","title":"Sports Grounds Safety Authority"},{"id":"1204925","text":"The Opposite of Sex is a 1998 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Don Roos, and starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan and Lisa Kudrow. It marked the final film produced by Rysher Entertainment. Plot Sixteen-year-old Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci) runs away from home. She is pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, Randy Cates (William Lee Scott). Not revealing her pregnancy, Dedee eventually moves in with her much older half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan), a gay teacher in a conservative, suburban community in Saint Joseph County, Indiana. Although he is living with Matt (Ivan Sergei), Bill still mourns the loss of his previous partner, Tom, who died of AIDS some time ago. Bill maintains a friendship with Tom's younger sister, Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), who idolized her brother. Dedee seduces Matt, then tricks him into believing he has impregnated her. They elope, leaving Bill and Lucia to track them down. Bill and Lucia find Dedee and Matt in Los Angeles, only to discover Dedee has stolen Tom's ashes and is holding them for ransom. Randy also finds Dedee; they inform Matt that they are taking the ashes and moving away. They escape but soon get into an argument that leads to Dedee accidentally shooting Randy. She and Matt escape to Canada. Lucia and Bill have a falling out after Lucia implies that Tom died as a result of having gay sex. Despondent, Lucia has a one-night stand with Sheriff Carl Tippett (Lyle Lovett) who had previously made unsuccessful romantic overtures to her. Lucia later discovers that she is pregnant. Bill eventually tracks down Matt and Dedee. Dedee goes into labor and Bill accompanies her into the delivery room. After giving birth to her son, Dedee returns Tom's ashes to Bill, apologizing for her actions in the past year. Dedee ends up serving time in prison, leaving her son in Bill's care while she's incarcerated. After a few months, she moves back in with Bill, while Matt goes traveling, and Lucia gives birth to her own child. Eventually, Dedee decides that her son would be better off with Bill, who is now dating Dedee's parole officer, and runs away. Dedee sarcastically concludes that sex is precisely the opposite of what people should want, leading as it does to kids, disease or, worst of all, relationships. At the end of the film, the vignettes of the various caring relationships among the characters show the opposite of superficial sexual gratification.

Janet Maslin in The New York Times called it a \\"gleefully acerbic comedy\\". Christina Ricci's performance was widely praised, and she also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy. Roger Ebert especially enjoyed the voice-over narration supplied in-character by Ricci, calling it \\"refreshing\\" and comparing it to Mystery Science Theater 3000: > When you've seen enough movies, alas, you can sense the gears laboriously > turning, and you know with a sinking heart that there will be no surprises. > The Dede character subverts those expectations; she shoots the legs out from > under the movie with perfectly timed zingers.

Roos supported himself by working as a word processor, and to this day jokes that he has that as a fall-back plan. Roos began his writing career when he had a friend of his impersonate an agent and represent him; a phone call led to a job with playwright Mart Crowley (The Boys in the Band), who at the time was Executive Producer of Hart to Hart. Roos went on to write for The Colbys, Nightingales, and other TV shows, before his spec scripts led to feature film writing assignments. His first major film was 1992's Academy Award-nominated Love Field, an interracial drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Dennis Haysbert. Roos's work as the writer of the film Single White Female has earned him a permanent space in Hollywood movie trivia, since that title has entered the lexicon in reference to the film's psychopathic lead character who begins to take on her roommate's identity. Roos is well known for his work writing strong and engaging female characters, a skill that has also been useful in his film direction, leading to Independent Spirit Award nominations for actors Lisa Kudrow, Christina Ricci and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, he was the first to map the structures of carotenoid pigments, including astaxanthin, rubixanthin and canthaxanthin. Personal life Weedon was born in Wimbledon, his father was a dentist and his mother came from a family of prosperous jewellers. His parents separated when he was nine years old and he remained living with his father, within a few years he had lost all contact with his mother and his younger sister. During World War II, he was evacuated to a farm near Guildford. His wife, Barbara Dawe, served in the Women's Royal Navy Service during World War II, whilst working there she met Basil's cousin and later Basil. They married in 1959 and had two children, Sarah and Matthew. Weedon suffered from Parkinson's disease in his later years. Academic life He attended Wandsworth Grammar School in South London, then a school in Guildford, prior to studying chemistry at Imperial College, London in 1940. He was awarded his degree just two years later, aged 19. He remained at Imperial College, studying for a PhD before taking a job with ICI working on dyes in Blackley, Manchester. He returned to Imperial College in 1947 as a lecturer in organic chemistry and became a reader in 1955. In 1960 he was appointed the Chair of organic chemistry at Queen Mary College. In 1976 he became the 4th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, a position he held until his retirement in 1988. He was a consultant to Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland between 1955 and 1978. Scientific discoveries Weedon, in collaboration with L. M. Jackman, was the first to use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structures of carotenoids. He also worked on the synthesis of carotenoids and in 1953 described the synthesis of methylbixin which was produced by exposing bixin from Bixa orellana to iodine; later he successfully synthesised bixin using the Wittig reaction. During the 1960s and 1970s, Weedon's research group elucidated the structures of and synthesised a wide range of naturally occurring carotenoids. These included, canthaxanthin (responsible for the pink colour of flamingos), astaxanthin (responsible for the colour of lobsters), capsanthin and capsorubin (found in red peppers), renieratene (from Japanese sea sponges) and fucoxanthin (the most abundant carotenoid found in seaweed). Other compounds whose structures were discovered include alloxanthin, mytiloxanthin, decaprenoxanthin and violerythrin.

It is situated approximately south of the city of Durham. It lies just outside Spennymoor, a short distance to the west of the Great North Road. The village is now a quiet backwater, its green a cul-de-sac that runs down from the main road towards the River Wear. In former times, however, Tudhoe lay at the centre of a network of roads: one ran to Durham by way of Sunderland Bridge and Croxdale, another to Kirk Merrington, a third to Bishop Auckland, a fourth to Whitworth and Byers Green, and a fifth across a ford to Brancepeth Castle and village on the far side of the river. All except the Brancepeth road are shown, somewhat schematically, on Thomas Jeffrey's map of County Durham of 1758. Tudhoe is now dwarfed by Spennymoor, an industrial town that grew up around the Tudhoe iron works in the 19th century. The modern town of Spennymoor lies only a few fields from Tudhoe, but the contours are such that it cannot be seen from most of the village, and Tudhoe today gives the impression that it is still an isolated country village. For most of its history, Tudhoe has been in the parish of Brancepeth. The parish church of St Brandon's, dating from the 16th century, was one of the finest village churches in County Durham until its destruction by fire in 1998. Brancepeth lies across the River Wear from Tudhoe; there has never been a bridge, and the ford was not an easy one. In winter, it was often impassable, and Tudhoe baptisms, weddings and burials then took place at Whitworth. Because of this, Tudhoe was always seen (from Brancepeth) as an isolated outpost. Tudhoe's own Anglican churches, Holy Innocents and St David's, were not built until 1866 and 1880, respectively, though there is a large Catholic church, dedicated to St. Charles Borromeo, which was founded in 1858. Tudhoe was renowned as a mining village until the end of the 20th century. Until the closure of the mines, the wealthy Colliery Masters took up residence in a grand mansion known as The Loggins, which stands in several acres of its own land and overlooks the area. Tudhoe United FC are the local football team and play in Spennymoor Sunday League.

The largest concentration of species is in China and Japan, with other species native to other parts of southern Asia as well as eastern and central Africa, Mexico and eastern North America.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Asiatic species are often called cobra lilies, while western species are often called jack-in-the-pulpit; both names refer to the distinctive appearance of the flower, which consists of an erect central spadix rising from a spathe.Govaerts, R. & Frodin, D.G.

Flora of North America, Vol. 22, Arisaema Martius, Flora. 14: 459. 1831. Classification and relationships The closest relatives of Arisaema appear to be Pinellia and Typhonium (although the latter as defined in 2004 seems to be paraphyletic, having given rise to Arisaema and other genera). One unusual trait shared by all Arisaema species, and not those of other genera, is the sex change or act of Sequential hermaphroditism. Arisaema plants are typically male when small, and female or hermaphroditic when large, with a single plant capable of changing sex based on nutrition and genetics, and perhaps changing sex several times during its long life (20 years or more).

In 1901 he was made associate Curator of Mammals and Birds and in 1908 Curator of Birds. Chapman came up with the original idea for the Audubon Christmas Bird Count. He also wrote many ornithological books such as, Bird Life, Birds of Eastern North America, and Life in an Air Castle. Chapman promoted the integration of photography into ornithology, especially in his book Bird Studies With a Camera, in which he discussed the practicability of the photographic blind and in 1901 invented his own more portable version of a blind using an umbrella with a large 'skirt' to conceal the photographer that could be bundled into a small pack for transport along with the other, at the time very bulky, paraphernalia of the camera gear. For his work, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia, he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1917. Chapman fathered one child, Frank Chapman, Jr., who first married playwright Elizabeth Cobb and had a daughter, actress and TV personality Buff Cobb,Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Buff Cobb, Actress and TV Host, Dies at 82\\", The New York Times, July 21, 2010 and after divorcing married mezzo- soprano opera singer Gladys Swarthout.

Biography =Early life= Miguel Ángel Blanco was born on 13 May 1968 in Ermua (Biscay) into a humble family. He had a sister, María del Mar. His father, Miguel Blanco, was a construction worker and his mother, Consuelo Garrido, was a housewife. They were Galician immigrants from Xunqueira de Espadanedo (Ourense, Galicia). Consuelo died on 1 April 2020 from coronavirus, three weeks after her husband's death. Miguel Ángel Blanco graduated in economics at the Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea in Sarriko. For a long time he worked with his father in construction, but he found work at Eman Consulting, in Eibar, where he commuted to every day by train. He also played the drums in the bands Póker and Cañaveral. He was a sports fan and his dream was to walk to Madrid to protest against the possible closure of the Ermua' sports centre. He joined the youth-wing of the PP, Nuevas Generaciones, in 1995 and, due to it being a relatively small party in the area where the national parties compete against the PNV, he was the third candidate for the municipal elections in that year; he became a member of the town's council. He had a sister, Marimar. =Kidnapping= On 10 July 1997, Blanco was kidnapped by ETA which threatened to assassinate him unless the Spanish Government started to transfer all ETA prisoners to prisons in the Basque Country within 48 hours. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in demonstrations throughout Spain, demanding his release. But 50 minutes after the deadline expired, at 16:50 on 12 July, he was shot in the back of the head. Shortly thereafter, he was found on the outskirts of San Sebastián, with his hands tied, dying. He died in the hospital at 4:30 a.m. on 13 July. He is interred in Faramontaos, A Merca, with his parents. =Repercussions= His kidnapping and death were very important to Spanish society. It also had a deep impact upon Basque society, and, in an unprecedented move, even some of ETA's own supporters publicly condemned the killing. The \\"Spirit of Ermua\\" was born at this time as was the anti-terrorist organization Foro de Ermua and the Fundación Miguel Ángel Blanco. 2006 saw the beginning of the trial of his kidnappers and murderers, Francisco Javier García Gaztelu (\\"Txapote\\") and his girlfriend, Irantzu Gallastegi (\\"Amaia\\"). Another kidnapper, José Luis Geresta Mujika, committed suicide two years after Blanco's murder.

It was originally released in the UK and Europe on 13 October 1978, in the US on 21 November 1978, and in Australia on 27 November 1978. The album was re- released in 1994 on Atco Records and in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. Background The album was released six months after the band's previous studio album Powerage. Originally, a greatest hits package had been in the works called 12 of the Best but the project was scrapped in favour of a live album. It was recorded during the 1978 Powerage tour and contains songs from T.N.T., Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Let There Be Rock, and Powerage. It is the last Bon Scott-era AC/DC album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young, who also produced the band's first five studio releases. In his 1994 Bon Scott memoir Highway to Hell, author Clinton Walker observes, \\"Live albums, which tended to be double or triple sets in which songs short in their studio versions were stretched out into extended tedium, were for some reason popular in the seventies. If You Want Blood reversed this tradition... it boasted a blunt ten tracks and, allowing nothing extraneous, got straight to the point, that being raging AC/DC rock and roll.\\" AC/DC's concert at the Apollo Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland on 30 April 1978 was used for the live tracks, and it has never been confirmed if any other concert tracks from this tour were also used. This concert will also be remembered for the encore when AC/DC came back on stage dressed in the Scottish Football strip, paying homage to Scott's and the Young brothers' homeland. A song with the same title of \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\" appeared on the next album, and the band's US album chart breakthrough, Highway to Hell. The song \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" performed on the night was eventually removed from the album release, and the encore \\"Fling Thing/Rocker\\", was edited for the album, removing \\"Fling Thing\\" and cutting out the extended Angus guitar solo, as he did a walk around the audience (with an early version of a wireless guitar lead). This part of the band's future concert theatrics was later replaced with \\"Let There Be Rock\\", as \\"Rocker\\" has not been performed more than a few times since the passing of Bon Scott in 1980. The live rendition of \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" from the concert was initially released as the B-side of the single \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" in November 1978, but only in Australia. It was later re-released worldwide in 2009 on the two (standard) and three (collectors) CD boxed set compilation Backtracks, featuring the Australian album only songs not released internationally at the time, and the live B-Sides from some 7\\" and 12\\" singles. The encore songs \\"Fling Thing\\" and \\"Rocker\\" (with its complete guitar solo) have appeared only on video footage of the concert by a Dutch TV station played at the time but were eventually released on the Family Jewels DVD. According to the 2006 book AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, the album title was an extension of Scott's response to a journalist at the Day on the Green festival in July 1978 who asked what they could expect from the band and Scott replied, \\"Blood.\\" The cover art is from a shoot done with Atlantic Records' staff photographer Jim Houghton before a show at Boston's Paradise Theater, the idea for which came from Atlantic's art director, Bob Defrin. Reception The album is often considered to be one of the greatest live albums of all time. In a 1992 interview with Metal Hammer at the time of the band's second live release, Malcolm Young admitted, \\"I personally still prefer the old album. We were young, fresh, vital and kicking ass.\\" Greg Prato of AllMusic notes, \\"While most other rock bands of the era were busy experimenting with disco or creating studio-perfected epics, AC/DC was one of the few specializing in raw and bluesy hard rock, as evidenced by 1978's live set, If You Want Blood You've Got It.\\" Eduardo Rivadavia of Ultimate Classic Rock enthuses, \\"Other concert records may boast more songs, more Top 40 hits or even more crowd- pleasing gimmicks. But very few can challenge the sheer excitement and reckless abandon captured on AC/DC’s terrific concert document.\\" The album was listed at #2 on Classic Rock magazine's readers' poll of \\"50 Greatest Live Albums Ever\\". Carlo Twist of Blender magazine praised the album, saying that \\"They were always a mighty live act, and this is the sound of AC/DC in Europe just prior to 1979’s U.S. breakthrough. The audience’s hysteria regularly cuts through the amps, as they howl along to singer Bon Scott’s tale of sexually transmitted disease (“The Jack”) and punctuate guitarist Angus Young’s staccato riffing on “Whole Lotta Rosie.” Imagine a punk-rock Chuck Berry played at nosebleed volume.\\" Concert footage The entire Glasgow concert was filmed but the complete footage has never been released. Eventually, \\"Riff Raff\\" and \\"Fling Thing/Rocker\\" segments were made available on the DVD AC/DC Family Jewels, released in 2005.

In the 2001 census it had a population of 4,830, increasing to 5,350 at the 2011 census. Location Bidford-on-Avon village is, as its name suggests, situated on the River Avon, some downstream of Stratford-upon-Avon and about the same distance upstream of Evesham. The village grew up around an ancient ford (Byda's Ford), now replaced by a narrow stone bridge, on the Ryknild Street Roman road, now a minor country road to Honeybourne to the south. To the north Alcester is about away, Redditch away and Birmingham away. It also lies on the Heart of England Way. Local government Bidford-on-Avon is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It falls within the areas of Stratford-on-Avon District Council and Warwickshire County Council. The three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government. Besides the village of Bidford itself, the civil parish includes the settlements of Barton, Broom and Marlcliff. Broom lies to the north of Bidford, whilst both Barton and Marlcliff lie south of the river. History Mop (Michaelmas Fair) c. 1900 Ryknield Street, the Roman road, passes through the village, going north towards Alcester. There is also an ancient Anglo-Saxon burial site under the free car park located just behind the Indian restaurant \\"No 72\\". First discovered in the 1920s, artefacts from more recent excavations are located at Warwick Museum, while material from the first excavations on the site currently resides in the hands of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. A Bronze Agebronze razor was found in excavations at Bidford-on-Avon.Warwickshire County Council: New Prehistoric Archaeology Objects \\"Even further away in time, during the Bronze Age, we now have evidence of people taking care of their appearance. This leaf-shaped bronze razor was found near Bidford on Avon and is one of only a few of this type of Bronze Age razor to be found in this country.\\" William Shakespeare is said to have joined a party of Stratford folk which set itself to outdrink a drinking club at Bidford-on-Avon, and as a result of his labours in that regard to have fallen asleep under the crab tree of which a descendant is still called Shakespeares tree. When morning dawned his friends wished to renew the encounter but he wisely said \\"No I have drunk with “Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston, Haunted Hillboro’, Hungry Grafton, Dodging Exhall, Papist Wixford, Beggarly Broom and Drunken Bidford” and so, presumably, I will drink no more.\\" The story is said to date from the 17th century but of its truth or of any connection of the story or the verse to Shakespeare there is no evidence. The Falcon Inn was a favourite tavern in his day.Hutton, W. H. (1914) Highways and Byways in Shakspeare's Country Bidford was the birthplace and childhood home of the 20th-century author Barbara Comyns. Transport =Bridge= Bridge over the River Avon The river is crossed by Bidford Bridge, which is a scheduled monument. During the week beginning Monday 26 November 2012, the Bridge had to be closed due to flooding, when the River Avon burst its banks, in various places. On 9 June 2015, the bridge was closed to traffic after a heavy duty farm vehicle crashed into it, causing serious damage to the historic structure. Police cars were positioned either side of the bridge to alert drivers to the fact that the bridge was inaccessible to traffic. After repairs, the bridge has now re-opened. =Railway= Bidford no longer has an active railway line, but it once had a station on the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway, which ran east–west across country from Broom Junction on the Midland Railway's Barnt Green-Redditch-Alcester-Evesham- Ashchurch line, through Stratford-upon-Avon to Towcester and beyond. The Broom to Stratford section (including Bidford and also Binton), was an early casualty, with passenger services suspended in June 1947 and closure rubber- stamped as permanent in May 1949. The line itself remained open with the south curve of Broom Junction until at least 1952.Dunn, J.M., (1952) The Stratford- upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway, Lingfield: The Oakwood Press Today the closest station to Bidford, is Honeybourne railway station, which is located 5 miles south of the village. Honeybourne station provides regular rail services to London Paddington, Oxford, Evesham, Worcester and Hereford along the Cotswold Line. =Road= The village was featured on the BBC motoring programme Top Gear when the presenters resurfaced a local road in a single day, a task that would have usually taken an entire working week. Churches The Anglican parish church is dedicated to St. Laurence. St. Joseph the Worker Church is the local Roman Catholic church. The Barn is the home of Bidford Baptist Church. Bidford also has a Methodist church.

Fossil record  This genus is known in the fossil record from the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene (from about 84.9 to 11.6 million years ago). Fossils of species within this genus have been found in Germany, Italy (Sardinia), United States, Egypt, Libya and Argentina (Bororó and Salamanquense Formations).Palmoxylon at Fossilworks.org Many species were described from the Deccan Traps in India.  Distribution  A number of species from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic have been described from the Patagonia region of South America.Ottone E. G. 2007 \\"A new palm trunk from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina\\" Ameghiniana v.44 n.4 There have been a number of species reported from Egypt which are dated to the Late Eocene and Early Miocene.EL-Saadawi, W., Youssef, S. G. & Kamal-EL-Din, M. M. 2004 \\"Fossil palm woods of Egypt: II. Seven Tertiary Palmoxylon species new to the country\\" Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology 129(4):199-211 Specimens from the Oligocene epoch (34 - 23 mya) can be collected from many scattered sites in east Texas and western Louisiana. Fossils found near fossil palmwood include corals, sponges, and mollusks, indicating that the palms grew along prehistoric beaches. For millions of years, the Gulf Coast shoreline has been moving farther south. In Texas and Louisiana, petrified palmwood is most common in the Toledo Bend area, which is shared by both states. It was left by trees that grew when the Gulf of Mexico's shoreline was much farther north from its present-day position. In Louisiana, petrified palmwood is found in the parishes of Rapides, Natchitoches, Grant, and Sabine.  Description  Fossil specimen of Palmoxylon Petrified palmwood includes a group of fossil woods that contain prominent rod-like structures within the regular grain of the silicified wood. Depending upon the angle at which they are cut by fracture, these rod-like structures show up as spots, tapering rods, or continuous lines. The rod-like structures are sclerenchyma bundles that comprise part of the woody tissues that gave the wood its vertical strength. Petrified palmwood is a favorite of rock collectors because it is replaced by silica and exhibits well-defined rod-like structures and variety of colors. As a result, it exhibits a wide range of colors and designs when cut that can be incorporated into jewelry and other ornamental items. Because it is composed of silica, it is hard enough to polish and withstand the wear and tear of normal use.  Archaeology  In Grant Parish, Louisiana (and probably in other areas also), Native Americans used petrified palmwood to make projectile points and other tools such as knives, awls, and scrapers. Projectile points and other tools crafted from petrified palmwood have been discovered in central Grant Parish by H.R. Hicks and other Native American artifact collectors. It is the state stone of Texas and the official state fossil of Louisiana.State Fossils  Species  Fossil trunks of Palmoxylon from Quaternary of Libyan Sahara There are more than 200 species assigned to the genus Palmoxylon at this time. *Palmoxylon araneus Nour-El-Deen, El-Saadawi & Thomas, 2018 (Paleogene; Jebel Qatrani Formation, Egypt) *Palmoxylon arcotense *Palmoxylon bhisiensis Dutta et al., 2007 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon blandfordiSchenk, 1882 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon bororense *Palmoxylon chhindwarense Prakash, 1960 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon colei (Eocene; Green River Formation, Eden Valley, Wyoming) *Palmoxylon compactum *Palmoxylon concordiense palmoxylon millie-- very rare to find but was very common in the united kingdom during winter *Palmoxylon contortum (Eocene; Green River Formation, Eden Valley, Wyoming) *Palmoxylon dakshinense Prakash, 1960 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon deccanensis Sahni, 1964 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon dilacunosum Ambwani, 1984 *Palmoxylon edenense (Eocene; Green River Formation, Eden Valley, Wyoming) *Palmoxylon elsaadawii Nour-El-Deen, El-Saadawi & Thomas, 2018 (Paleogene; Jebel Qatrani Formation, Egypt) *Palmoxylon eocenum Prakash, 1962 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon geometricum *Palmoxylon hislopi Rode, 1933 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) *Palmoxylon indicum *Palmoxylon kamalamRode, 1933 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) *Palmoxylon lametaei (Maastrichtian; Lameta Formation, Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon livistoniforme *Palmoxylon livistonoides Prakash & Ambwani, 1980 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) *Palmoxylon macginitiei (Eocene; Green River Formation, Eden Valley, Wyoming) *Palmoxylon mathuri Sahni, 1931 (Cretaceous, Gujarat, India) *Palmoxylon parapaniensis Lakhanpal et al., 1979 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) *Palmoxylon parthasarathyi Rao & Menon, 1964 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) * Palmoxylon patagonicum (Paleocene, Patagonia, Argentina) *Palmoxylon pichaihuensis *Palmoxylon pondicherriense *Palmoxylon pyriforme *Palmoxylon qatraniense Nour-El-Deen, El-Saadawi & Thomas, 2018 (Paleogene; Jebel Qatrani Formation, Egypt) *Palmoxylon queenslandicum *Palmoxylon rewahense *Palmoxylon riograndense *Palmoxylon sagari *Palmoxylon santarosense *Palmoxylon superbum Trivedi & Verma, 1971 (Cretaceous, Deccan Traps; India) *Palmoxylon valchetense *Palmoxylon vaterum *Palmoxylon wadai Sahni, 1931 (Cretaceous; Deccan Traps, India) *Palmoxylon yuqueriense  References   Further reading  * McMackin, C.

Ashridge Executive Education (also known as the Ashridge Programme or Ashridge) is the executive education programme of Hult International Business School, housed in Hult's Ashridge Estate campus. Formerly an independent business school, known as Ashridge Business School, Ashridge completed an operational merger with Hult in 2015. Its activities include open and tailored executive education programmes, Master of Business Administration, Master of Science and diploma qualifications, as well as organisation consulting and applied research. History The college was conceived at Ashridge House in 1921, when the house was acquired by a trust established by Bonar Law, a future UK Prime Minister; in 1929 it became a \\"College of Citizenship\\", established to help the Conservative Party develop its intellectual forces in struggles with left- wing organisations such as the Fabian Society. It became a cross between a think-tank and a training centre and had Arthur Bryant as its educational adviser. After the War, the \\"College of Citizenship\\" was briefly re- established but in 1959 it was re-launched as a management training college. In 2015, Ashridge Business School operationally merged with Hult International Business School, an American business school with campuses in seven cities around the world. As part of the merger, Ashridge Business School changed its name to Ashridge Executive Education.  Campus  The Ashridge programme is based at Ashridge House, one of the largest Gothic Revival country houses in the United Kingdom. The school has a number of representatives in Europe and throughout the world, including in Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, China, India, United Arab Emirates, North America and the Benelux countries. Organization and administration =Constitution= Ashridge Business School is constituted as a registered charity, formally named the Ashridge (Bonar Law Memorial) Trust, and is one of the 150 largest UK charitable organisations ranked by annual expenditure.

Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods (here collectively called \\"vectors\\") which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the \\"neglected tropical diseases\\" are spread by such vectors.  Importance  For diseases where there is no effective cure, such as Zika virus, West Nile fever and Dengue fever, vector control remains the only way to protect human populations. However, even for vector-borne diseases with effective treatments the high cost of treatment remains a huge barrier to large amounts of developing world populations. Despite being treatable, malaria has by far the greatest impact on human health from vectors. In Africa, a child dies every minute of malaria; this is a reduction of more than 50% since 2000 due to vector control. In countries where malaria is well established the World Health Organization estimates countries lose 1.3% annual economic income due to the disease. Both prevention through vector control and treatment are needed to protect populations. As the impacts of disease and virus are devastating, the need to control the vectors in which they carried is prioritized. Vector control in many developing countries can have tremendous impacts as it increases mortality rates, especially among infants. Because of the high movement of the population, disease spread is also a greater issue in these areas. As many vector control methods are effective against multiple diseases, they can be integrated together to combat multiple diseases at once. The World Health Organization therefore recommends \\"Integrated Vector Management\\" as the process for developing and implementing strategies for vector control.  Methods  Vector control focuses on utilizing preventive methods to control or eliminate vector populations. Common preventive measures are: =Habitat and environmental control= Removing or reducing areas where vectors can easily breed can help limit their growth. For example, stagnant water removal, destruction of old tires and cans which serve as mosquito breeding environments, and good management of used water can reduce areas of excessive vector incidence. Further examples of environmental control is by reducing the prevalence of open defecation or improving the designs and maintenance of pit latrines. This can reduce the incidence of flies acting as vectors to spread diseases via their contact with feces of infected people. =Reducing contact= Limiting exposure to insects or animals that are known disease vectors can reduce infection risks significantly. For example, bed nets, window screens on homes, or protective clothing can help reduce the likelihood of contact with vectors. To be effective this requires education and promotion of methods among the population to raise the awareness of vector threats. =Chemical control= Insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, Lethal ovitraps and repellents can be used to control vectors. For example, larvicides can be used in mosquito breeding zones; insecticides can be applied to house walls or bed nets, and use of personal repellents can reduce incidence of insect bites and thus infection. The use of pesticides for vector control is promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has proven to be highly effective. =Biological control= The use of natural vector predators, such as bacterial toxins or botanical compounds, can help control vector populations. Using fish that eat mosquito larvae, the use cat fish to eat up mosquito larve in pond can eradicate the mosquito population, or reducing breeding rates by introducing sterilized male tsetse flies have been shown to control vector populations and reduce infection risks.  Legislation  = United States = In the United States, cities or special districts are responsible for vector control. For example, in California, the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District is a special district set up by the state to oversee vector control in multiple cities.

It was adapted from the eponymous 1984 book by Lucy Irvine, telling of her experiences of staying for a year with writer Gerald Kingsland on the isolated island of Tuin, between New Guinea and Australia. Real life inspiration In 1980, Lucy Irvine responded to an advertisement placed by writer Gerald Kingsland, and they became self- imposed castaways for a year on the isolated and uninhabited island of Tuin, in the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia. Chosen by Kingsland from over 50 applicants, Irvine agreed to marry him to satisfy immigration restrictions before they travelled to Tuin. She was 25 years old, and he was 49. After a year, they returned home, and in 1983, she published her account of the experience in Castaway, which was later used as the basis for the 1986 film. In 2011, Donohoe recalled her experience working with Reed, stating: 'Well, naked on a desert island with Oliver Reed – it was a tabloid fantasy, wasn't it? He was an alcoholic and his behaviour was erratic, but he was always a courteous and good actor. His personal life wasn't working but he never crossed any lines professionally.' Soundtrack The film opens with a song by English artist Kate Bush, \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\". A slightly edited version later appeared on the 1997 re-release of her album Hounds of Love.

It flows from Baeyanggol Valley (배양골), Wolpyeong-ri (월평리/), Dudong-myeon (두동면/), Ulju County in Ulsan to the Sea of Japan (East Sea), covering a distance of about 62 km. The Hyeongsan watershed covers roughly 1,167 km² (Jo 1987:35). The Hyeongsan flows north from near the northern border of Greater Ulsan into Gyeongju city, where it enters the Gyeongju Basin and is joined by the Bukcheon stream (북천/), a major tributary. It continues north into Pohang city, and in Angang-eup of Pohang it is joined by the Gigyecheon flowing from the north and turns abruptly eastward. From there runs east and slightly north until it meets the Sea of Korea at Pohang Harbor. The estuary of the Hyeongsan has been covered by the massive industrial development around the port of Pohang, including the POSCO steel mill. History The Hyeongsan is primarily notable for the Silla civilization which arose within its valley, centered at Gyeongju. Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period potsherds have been unearthed in the Hyeongsan Basin. Several significant Mumun settlements arose along the river after 1100 B.C., notably Wolsan-ri and Hwangseong-dong (FPCP 2005; GNRICH 2003). Economy Today the Hyeongsan continues to play a role in local transport, as it has for thousands of years. Although very little boat traffic is found on the river, the river valley still provides an important transportation corridor. Highways connecting Ulsan, Gyeongju and Pohang follow the river's course, as does the Donghae Nambu Line passenger railway from Gyeongju to Pohang. The sprawling industrial facilities of Pohang Iron and Steel (POSCO) and INI Steel are located in Pohang just south of the mouth of the Hyeongsan. The eastern bank of the river in the suburbs north of the old city of Gyeongju are the home to many industrial facilities.

It was one of the few towns of the historic County Dublin. Rush lies on the Irish Sea coast, between Skerries and Lusk, and has a small harbour. It had a population at the 2011 census of 9,231. Rush was once viewed as the heart of market gardening in Leinster and many people were employed in agriculture. Nowadays, however, horticulture and agriculture have been superseded by Rush's increasing role as a \\"commuter belt\\" town. Geography Rush lies on the Irish Sea coast, on the angle where the R128 regional road turns from running east–west from Lusk to go north–south to Skerries. It has a small harbour. Rush is in a slightly hilly coastal area. Four streams come to the sea in the vicinity, St. Catherine's Stream, Kenure Stream, the Rush Town Stream, and a combined flow at the western edge of the town; some occasionally cause flooding. The middle two cross Rush's North Strand beach. Rush is also a townland in the civil parish of Lusk in the barony of Balrothery East.Placenames Database of Ireland - Rush townland  History and historic features  There is evidence of settlement in the Rush area dating back to Neolithic times. Flint tools have been found in the area and there is a passage grave and cist located off the Skerries Road on the headland to the north of North Beach. = Drumanagh = A giant promontory fort is located on the headland of Drumanagh, north of Rush. It is surrounded on three sides by cliffs and a large rampart encloses the fourth side. The fort was acquired by Fingal County Council in 2016 and is of significant interest following the recovery of Romano-British artefacts, rarely found in Ireland. It has been characterised as the place where Roman traders may have landed. A range of finds were made in the course of a \\"community archaeology\\" dig along two trenches by the Martello Tower at the Iron Age site. Fingal Community Archaeologist and excavation director, Christine Baker, said: “Growing up down the road and having been a scholar under the late Iron Age scholar, Prof Barry Raftery, I always dreamed of digging Drumanagh. Artefacts such as a belt brace of the Royal Downshire militia and Royal Artillery brass buttons were found alongside fragments of wine glasses, clay pipes and a range of pottery and food particles, adding to the story of the Martello.” Evidence of earlier activity was also recovered during the dig including shards of pottery which have their origins in the Roman era, and two decorated Iron Age combs. Also found were two fragments of human bone which have been identified as part of a female skull dating back to BC170-AD52, as identified by osteologist Dr Linda Lynch and radiocarbon dated by Queen’s University Belfast. A conservation plan for the Drumanagh fort has been developed by Fingal County Council. Following a process of public consultation, the Drumanagh Conservation Study & Heritage Plan 2018-2023 contains accessible historical, archaeological, folkloric, and cartographic evidence. It also sets out policies and objectives for the future protection and management of the site. An article in The Sunday Times in January 1996 claimed that Roman coins, brooches and copper ingots were found at the site and that there was \\"clear evidence...of a Roman coastal fort of up to 40 acres...a significant Roman beachhead, built to support military campaigns in the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D.\\". This claim is disputed by many archaeologists who see this simply as evidence of trade between Ireland and the Romans. The artifacts were illegally excavated after being discovered with metal detectors, so they have not been available for further study. According to Barry Raftery of UCD Drumanagh \\"may well have been (and probably was) a major trading station linking Ireland and Roman Britain. It was probably populated with a mixture of Irish, Romano-British, Gallo-Roman, and others, doubtless including a few genuine Romans as well\\". Legal disputes with the land owner have meant that further excavations have not been carried out to be able to settle the debate. = Saint Maur's church = Ruins of the original St. Maur's chapelThe ruins of the original St. Maur's chapel lie in Whitestown cemetery, about a mile west of the centre of Rush. These date back to Anglo- Norman times and are named after Saint Maurus, a followers of St. Benedict.ChaptersOfDublin.com/books St Maur's chapel There is a legend connected with these ruins that some French navigators, who may have been crusaders, got caught in a storm. They made a vow to St. Maur that if they survived they would build a chapel in his honour on the first point of land they reached. They subsequently landed at Rogerstown and built a chapel there in his honour. The area became known as Knightstown and later Whitestown. In 1776, a church was built closer to the centre of Rush to replace the old chapel. It was also dedicated to St. Maur and is one of the earliest examples of a penal Catholic church in the Fingal area. It now houses Rush library. The current Catholic church of Saint Maur is beside the 1776 building. It was dedicated in 1989 and is in the new, post-Vatican II style. = Kenure House = Two miles north from the centre of Rush village lies a magnificent portico which is all that remains of Kenure House, a large mansion which had many acres of an estate around it. The name is an anglicised version of \\"Ceann Iubhair\\", meaning headland of the yew trees. There is a nearby ruined church which was dedicated to St. Damnan and also nearby are the ruins of a small Norman keep. Kenure formed part of the ancient manor of Rush, which was vested in the Earls and Dukes of Ormonde in 1666. They held on to their lands in Rush until 1714 until the Echlins took over. They remained there until 1780. Elizabeth Echlin married Francis Palmer of Castlelacken Co Mayo. Colonel R H Fenwick-Palmer, the last of the line, sold the estate to the Irish Land Commission in 1964. The portico of Kenure House was added to the house in and about 1840, by George Papworth, an English architect who practised in Ireland during the 19th century. Many films were made on location at the great house. These include The Face of Fu Manchu (1965), Ten Little Indians (1965 film which features the great house extensively as the main setting for the story, with some fleeting glimpses of the outside portico) and Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (aka Rocket to the Moon) (1967). The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1978, when the housing estate Saint Catherines was built on part of the former estate.Kenure House = Smuggling = Rush was notorious for smuggling in the 18th century after the British imposed excise duties on a large number of goods. It was home to the famed smuggler, Jack Connor (aka Jack the Batchelor and also Jack Field) and the birthplace of the pirate Luke Ryan. Jack Connor was a popular Robin hood type figure who is mentioned in an old ballad:Jack the Batchelor The lover may sigh The courtier may lie And Croesus his treasure amass, All these joys are but vain They are blended with pain I'll stand behind Field and my glass Jack operated out of the \\"Smugglers Cave\\" between Loughshinny and Skerries. He died in 1772 and was buried in Kenure cemetery. Luke Ryan was born in Rush in 1750. He emigrated to France when he was young and became a Lieutenant in Dillon's Irish Regiment. He later became a smuggler after returning to Rush. He was commissioned by Benjamin Franklin to run a privateer, The Black prince, to plunder English ships. He accumulated great wealth from his smuggling, but it was taken from him by the French. He eventually died in a debtors prison in 1789 owing a debt of 200 pounds. = Martello towers = Rush is home to 2 of the 29 Martello Towers in the Greater Dublin Area; they are on the headland near the North Beach and at Drumanagh, and were built in 1804 as a defence against Napoleon.  Amenities  The beach at Rush, Summer 2011 Rush has two sandy beaches, called the North Beach and South Beach, which are separated by the rocky head of the peninsula and a small tidal harbour, Rush Harbour. The peninsula is the closest point of land to the privately owned Lambay Island. The prevailing winds and tides make Rush South Beach an extremely popular kitesurfing location while its sand and dunes attract many visitors. Close to the south shore is 9 hole golf links. In the past, Rush had many caravan sites which were popular for summer holidays. It still has some caravan sites close to its beaches. Rush sailing club is also located near the south shore and operates from a second harbour, Rogerstown harbour, situated on the Rogerstown Estuary, known locally as 'the pier.' This harbour is also used by a supply boat, The Shamrock, which provides supplies for the inhabitants of Lambay island. Rush has several pubs and clubs together with a small number of restaurants. The local Millbank Theatre, home to Rush Dramatic Society is respected for its quality plays and dramas.Millbank theatre Rush Musical Society is well respected for its annual productions also.Rush Musical Society =Education= Rush has three primary schools, Gaelscoil Ros Eo, Rush National School, and St. Catherines National School. There is also a secondary school, St.Joseph's Secondary School.

It is a fictional tale about a young woman's desperate search for her fiancé who might have been killed during World War I. It was based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Sébastien Japrisot. The film was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars. Marion Cotillard won the César Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Plot Five French soldiers are convicted of self-mutilation in order to escape military service during World War I. They are condemned to face near-certain death in the no man's land between the French and German trench lines. It appears that all of them were killed in a subsequent battle, but Mathilde, the fiancée of one of the soldiers, refuses to give up hope and begins to uncover clues as to what actually took place on the battlefield. She is all the while driven by the constant reminder of what her fiancé had carved into one of the bells of the church near their home, MMM for Manech Aime Mathilde (Manech Loves Mathilde; a pun on the French word aime, which is pronounced like the letter \\"M\\". In the English-language version, this is changed to \\"Manech's Marrying Mathilde\\"). Along the way, she discovers the brutally corrupt system used by the French government to deal with those who tried to escape the front. She also discovers the stories of the other men who were sentenced to the no man's land as a punishment. She, with the help of a private investigator, attempts to find out what happened to her fiancé. The story is told both from the point of view of the fiancée in Paris and the French countryside—mostly Brittany—of the 1920s, and through flashbacks to the battlefield. Eventually, Mathilde finds out her fiancé is alive, but he suffers from amnesia. Seeing Mathilde, Manech seems to be oblivious of her. At this, Mathilde sits on the garden chair silently watching Manech with tears in her eyes and smile on her lips.

Right before the film's New York City and Hollywood debut, the film's production company (\\"2003 Productions\\"), which is one-third owned by Warner Brothers and two-thirds owned by Warner France, was ruled an American production company by a French court, denying the studio $4.8 million in government incentives,. The ruling is consistent with the fact that Warner France is owned by Warner Spain, which is owned by Warner Nederland, itself a subsidiary of Warner Brothers. Warner Independent released the film theatrically in the US, followed by VHS and DVD release on July 12, 2005. It was Warner Independent's final VHS release. The only Blu-ray to date is a region B disc from Warner Home Video in France. In the film, Manech and Mathilde are from Brittany, whereas in the novel, they are from Capbreton, in the Landes department of southwest France.

Golden Gate Bridge seen from the Marin Headlands at nightfall The Marin Headlands is a hilly peninsula at the southernmost end of Marin County, California, United States, located just north of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects the two counties and peninsulas. The entire area is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Headlands are famous for their views of the Bay Area, especially of the Golden Gate Bridge. Climate The Headlands sometimes create their own clouds when moist, warm Pacific Ocean breezes are pushed into higher, colder air, causing condensation, fog, fog drip and perhaps rain. The hills also get more precipitation than at sea level, for the same reason. However, despite being relatively wet, strong gusty Pacific winds prevent dense forests from forming. The many gaps, ridges, and valleys in the hills increase the wind speed and periodically, during powerful winter storms, these winds can reach hurricane force. In summer, breezes can still be very gusty, when the oceanic air and fog cross the hills. November through February in the Headlands are dominated by periodic rainstorms that blow in from the Pacific, often originating in the Gulf of Alaska, and give the area the majority of its rainfall for the year. These cloudy, gray, and rainy days often are interspersed with cool but extremely clear ones. As winter turns to spring, the April-to-June weather tends to be dominated by powerful winds, less rain, and clearer skies. Summer days alternate between clear and warm intervals, giving way to foggy and cool periods. September and October bring the highest average temperatures of the year and the longest stretches of clear skies.Sausalito Weather - California - Average Temperatures and Rainfall Hawk Hill The centerpoint of the Marin Headlands skyline is the Hawk Hill, the lookout point for the largest known flight of diurnal raptors in the Pacific states. Each autumn, from August into December, tens of thousands of hawks, kites, falcons, eagles, vultures, osprey, and harriers are funneled by the peninsular shape of Marin County into the headlands. Hawks avoid flight over water since warm thermals that provide lift are rare. Abundant populations of small mammals protected by the park are one resource that helps maintain the large number of visiting raptors in the Headlands during the fall, but the strong onshore winds hitting the hills of the Headlands provide cold updrafts and hot late summer days provide warm thermals that allow these birds to fly more efficiently. Volunteers with the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory count and track this fall migration using bird- banding and radio-tracking techniques, all in cooperation with the National Park Service. Wildlife The Marin Headlands are also home to black tail deer, mountain lions, bobcats, two types of fox, coyotes, wild turkeys, hares, rabbits, raccoons, and skunks. In 2003, there was a reported sighting of a black bear in the Headlands; the report was lent credence by a 2012 finding of bear scat on a hiking trail in the Kent Lake watershed, and another sighting on the Point Reyes National Seashore in 2011.Black Bear Scat Found Along Mt. Tamalpais Watershed « CBS San Francisco. Sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com (2011-09-27). Retrieved on 2013-07-21. River otters inhabit the freshwater lagoons and streams. Large numbers of water birds also migrate through the Headlands, including brown pelicans from May through October; and grebes, egrets, and great blue herons in the spring, summer, and fall. The Headlands' status as a park protects the habitat and populations of these animals within just a few miles of San Francisco and its suburbs. In the waters surrounding the Headlands, harbor seals can be found year-round, gray whales can be seen in the spring and fall, and seabirds such as common murres and surf scoters swim within sight of shore. When Richard Henry Dana, Jr. visited San Francisco Bay in 1835 he wrote about vast elk (Cervus canadensis) herds on the Marin Headlands on December 27: \\"...we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay, under a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of hundreds and hundreds of red deer [note: \\"red deer\\" is the European term for \\"elk\\"], and the stag, with his high branching antlers, were bounding about...\\" Geology Well-preserved pillow lava in Marin Headlands The Marin Headlands are underlain by fascinating geological formations created by the accretion of oceanic sediments from the Pacific Plate onto the North American Plate. The process of subduction of ocean floor, followed by tectonic underplating to the underside of the over-riding plate, was first described here by Clyde Wahrhaftig in 1984. The primary rock types of the Marin Headlands include graywacke sandstone, radiolarian chert, serpentinite, pillow basalts, and shale. These rocks began their migration over one hundred million years ago from as far south as present-day Los Angeles. The erosion of the hillsides and construction activities during the military era have exposed some dramatic examples of these rock types for easy viewing, and the folding caused by tectonic action is visually evident in many places throughout the Headlands. Aerial view of the Marin Headlands, Golden Gate Bridge, and San Francisco. Marin Headlands is one of the featured field trips found in the Streetcar 2 Subduction online field trip guide series released in December 2019 by the American Geophysical Union. Cultural history =Native Americans= The Marin Headlands is home to the Coastal Miwok tribe. Before colonization, western expansion, and gentrification, the Miwok freely moved between the bay side of the peninsula and the ocean side, seasonally, for thousands of years. The growth of the San Francisco Bay area has negatively impacted Miwok sacred sites, culture, and tribal visibility. Miwok continue to seek federal recognition. =Ranchos= In the 18th century, Spanish and Mexican ranchers occupied the Headlands, eventually giving way to Portuguese immigrant dairy farmers (often from the Azores) during the American period following the U.S. acquisition of California in the Mexican–American War. =Military sites= Battery Spencer, the closest defense site at the Marin Headlands to the Golden Gate Bridge The Marin Headlands is the site of a number of historic military settlements fortifications, including Fort Cronkhite, Fort Barry, a large number of bunkers and batteries, and the SF-88 Nike Missile silo. From the 1890s, the first military installations were built to prevent hostile ships from entering San Francisco Bay. The batteries at Kirby Cove, above Black Sands Beach, south of Rodeo Beach, and at Battery Mendell are examples of fortifications from the pre-World War I period. During World War II Batteries Wallace, Townsley, and 129 on Hawk Hill were built into the hills to protect them from aerial bombardment and the high caliber shells that would be fired by Axis battleships. The emplacements at the top of Hawk Hill were used for a radio station. During the Cold War, the gun batteries were decommissioned, but antiaircraft missile sites were built on the northern and southern sides of Rodeo Lagoon. Radar sites were placed atop Hawk Hill and Hill 88. At several locations, shelters were built into the hillsides to protect the military personnel from the use of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.The Marin Headlands Observation posts known as base end stations can also be found in the Headlands. A well-preserved example can be seen near the northern end of Rodeo Beach, and others are located near the Point Bonita Lighthouse and on Wolf Ridge as it slopes down to the sea. All military sites in the Headlands are now decommissioned and returned to civilian use. Some military facilities, such as SF-88, have been preserved as historical sites. Many historical buildings are now used by non-profit organizations, but maintained in their historical condition. Other historic landmarks in the Headlands include Point Bonita Lighthouse. =Development= In the 1960s, the government sold over of land in the Marin Headlands to a private developer who planned to build a city named Marincello. The development would house 30,000 people amongst 50 apartment towers, vast tracts of single-family homes, and a hotel along the headlands pristine shoreline and hills. In 1970, the developer lost a lawsuit claiming the land was illegally zoned. The thousands of acres that would have been developed were sold to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area allowing the open space to stay intact as a park.\\"Saved by Grit and Grace: Wild Legacy of the Marin Headlands\\" by John Hart, Bay Nature, July-September 2003 Recreation =Views= The area has views of San Francisco and, as such, is a tourist destination. One of the most common photographs of San Francisco is the view of the city from the Headlands with the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge just reaching out of the fog. On clear days, the site takes in views of the bay, including the Farallon Islands, Angel Island, Alcatraz, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge and the East Bay.

A short distance further on the right, in a grove of Monterey pines, is a bench from which it is possible to view the Golden Gate, ship traffic beneath the bridge, and the city just beyond. =Beaches= View from Kirby Cove The entrance to the Golden Gate from Battery Wallace Mano Seca Bench Overlooking Rodeo Beach in the Marin Headlands. Velella (By-the-wind Sailors) are stranded, forming blue ribbons. The Headlands offers a number of beaches including Rodeo Beach (a pebble- covered, dark sand beach), Kirby Cove, Pirates' Cove, Black Sands Beach, Tennessee Beach, Muir Beach. Rodeo and Muir Beaches are accessible by car, while the others require hikes of varying length and difficulty. =Hiking/biking= There are many hiking and biking trails in the Headlands, several of which pass through coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and riparian areas. =Birding= The raptor migration attracts birdwatchers to Hawk Hill, and waterfowl and seabirds can sometimes be seen on Rodeo Lagoon. Facilities and notable places The National Park Service maintains a visitor center near the intersection of Field Road and Bunker Road about a mile from Rodeo Beach. The visitor center contains historical and natural history displays as well as a small bookstore/gift shop. Hiking maps and Park Service program information are available as well. Facilities include Presidio Fire Department Fire Station No. 2, located at building 1045 Fort Cronkhite. This fire station is operated by the National Park Service and houses one fire engine with cliff rescue capabilities. Public restrooms are available in the Headlands at the visitor center parking lot, the parking lot near Rodeo Beach, and portable toilet facilities are available at the trailhead leading to the Point Bonita Lighthouse, along Conzelman Road near Black Sands Beach, at Battery Alexander dug into the hillside between Rodeo Beach and the Lighthouse, and at Battery 129 on Hawk Hill. Conference center facilities are located in former military buildings maintained by the Point Bonita YMCA, NatureBridge, and the Headlands Center for the Arts. The Cavallo Point conference center is in East Fort Baker on the eastern side of the peninsula. Other areas within Marin Headlands include Kirby Cove, Rodeo Lagoon, and Tennessee Cove. Various nonprofit organizations have facilities in Marin Headlands. These include the Marine Mammal Center, the Foundation for Deep Ecology, and the NatureBridge campus (formerly known as the Headlands Institute), all in Fort Cronkhite; the Headlands Center for the Arts and the Marin Headlands Hostel at Fort Barry; and the Marin Headlands and Tennessee Valley Native Plant Nurseries.

It is situated about from Durham on the A690 road between Durham and Weardale. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 414. Brancepeth Castle was until 1570 the fortress of the Neville Earls of Westmorland. The castle was extensively modified and rebuilt in the 19th century by Viscount Boyne (later Baron Brancepeth). It was later a military hospital. St Brandon's Church was famed for its exceptional 17th- century woodwork, until it was destroyed in a major fire in 1998; the church has since been restored and reroofed. In 1924, Harry Colt laid out a golf course on the deer park which formed part of the estate surrounding the castle. A club house was created from the old coach house and stables and remains in use by Brancepeth Castle Golf Club. The 6400-yard, par 70 course is regarded as one of the finest in the north-east of England. Remains of Brancepeth railway station in 1965 According to one story, the village's name is said to derive from \\"Brawn's Path\\". There is a legend that Brancepeth was once terrorized by an enormous brawn, which was eventually killed by a knight named Sir Roger de Ferie in 1208.

She was sunk on 6 October 1941 near Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea and is now a well known diving site. Construction Thistlegorm was built by Joseph Thompson & Sons shipyard in Sunderland for the Albyn Line and launched in April 1940. She was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine rated to 1,850 hp (1,380 kW). The vessel was privately owned but had been partly financed by the British government and was classified as an armed freighter. She was armed with a 4.7-inch (120 mm) anti- aircraft gun and a heavy-calibre machine gun attached after construction to the stern of the ship. She was one of a number of \\"Thistle\\" ships owned and operated by the Albyn Line, which was founded in 1901, based in Sunderland, and had four vessels at the outbreak of World War II. The vessel carried out three successful voyages after her launch. The first was to the US to collect steel rails and aircraft parts, the second to Argentina for grain, and the third to the West Indies for rum.

At the time the Thistlegorm sailed from Glasgow in June, this was the Western Desert Force, which in September 1941 became part of the newly formed Eighth Army. The crew of the ship, under Captain William Ellis, were supplemented by nine naval personnel to man the machine gun and the anti-aircraft gun. Due to German and Italian naval and air force activity in the Mediterranean, the Thistlegorm sailed as part of a convoy via Cape Town, South Africa, where she refuelled, before heading north up the East coast of Africa and into the Red Sea. On leaving Cape Town, the light cruiser joined the convoy. Due to a collision in the Suez Canal, the convoy could not transit through the canal to reach the port of Alexandria and instead moored at Safe Anchorage F,Diver Magazine December 2006 in September 1941 where she remained at anchor until her sinking on 6 October 1941. HMS Carlisle moored in the same anchorage. There was a large build-up of Allied troops in Egypt during September 1941 and German intelligence (Abwehr) suspected that there was a troop carrier in the area bringing in additional troops. Two Heinkel He 111 aircraft of II Staffeln, Kampfgeschwader 26, Luftwaffe, were dispatched from Crete to find and destroy the troop carrier. This search failed but one of the bombers discovered the vessels moored in Safe Anchorage F. Targeting the largest ship, they dropped two 2.5 tonne high explosive bombs on the Thistlegorm, both of which struck hold 4 near the stern of the ship at 0130 on 6 October. The bomb and the explosion of some of the ammunition stored in hold 4 led to the sinking of the Thistlegorm with the loss of four sailors and five members of the Royal Navy gun crew. The survivors were picked up by HMS Carlisle. Captain Ellis was awarded the OBE for his actions following the explosion and a crewman, Angus McLeay, was awarded the George Medal and the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea for saving another crew member. Most of the cargo remained within the ship, the major exception being the steam locomotives from the deck cargo which were blown off to either side of the wreck. Discovery by Cousteau In the early fifties, Jacques Cousteau discovered her by using information from local fishermen. He raised several items from the wreck, including a motorcycle, the captain's safe, and the ship's bell. The February 1956 edition of National Geographic clearly shows the ship's bell in place and Cousteau's divers in the ship's lantern room. Cousteau documented diving on the wreck in part of his book The Living Sea. Rediscovery and recreational dive site Aft view of the walkway leading to the bridge of Thistlegorm. Following Cousteau's visit, the site was forgotten about except by local fishermen. In the early 1990s, Sharm el-Sheikh began to develop as a diving resort. Recreational diving on the Thistlegorm restarted following the visit of the dive boat Poolster,Diver Magazine February 2006 using information from another Israeli fishing boat captain. The massive explosion that sank her had blown much of her midships superstructure away and makes the wreck very accessible to divers. The depth of around 30 m (100 feet) at its deepest is ideal for diving without the need for specialist equipment and training. The wreck attracts many divers for the amount of the cargo that can be seen and explored. Boots and motorcycles are visible in Hold No. 1. Trucks, motorcycles, Wellington boots, rifles, Westland Lysander wings, about twenty Bristol Mercury radial engine exhaust rings and a handful of cylinders and Bristol Blenheim bomber tailplanes are visible in Hold No. 2. Universal Carrier armoured vehicles, RAF trolley accumulators, and two Pundit Lights can also be found. Off to the port side of the wreck level with the blast area can be found one of the steam locomotives which had been stored as deck cargo and the other locomotive is off the starboard side level with Hold No. 2. The wreck is rapidly disintegrating due to natural rusting. The dive boats that rely on the wreck for their livelihood are also tearing the wreck apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the wreck, leading to parts of the wreck collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and drilled holes in the wreck to allow trapped air to escape.HEPCA During this work, the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the wreck were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual wreck). As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the wreck again. Common interesting animals around the wreck are tuna, barracuda, batfish, moray eel, lionfish, stonefish, crocodilefish, scorpionfish, and sea turtle. The Times named the Thistlegorm as one of the top 10 wreck diving sites in the world.

He was a member of parliament for Cambridge University from 1922 to 1923. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge from 1947 to 1954, and Vice-Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1954 to 1960. He also saw military service during both the First and Second World Wars. Early life and education Butler was born at Trinity College, Cambridge where his father, Henry Montagu Butler (1833–1918),DNB 1912–1921, London : Oxford University Press, 1927, p.78 Cambridge senior classic in 1855, was master of the college (1886–1918). His mother, Montagu Butler's second wife, Agnata Frances Ramsay, attained the highest marks in the Classical Tripos at Cambridge in 1887.DNB 1912–1921, London : Oxford University Press, 1927, p.80 With this impeccable classical background, Butler attended Harrow School and then Trinity College. As an undergraduate he was a brilliant scholar, winning a number of prizes including the Chancellor's Medal in Classics and the Craven Scholarship, and gaining a double first class in Classics and History. He was also president of the Cambridge Union in 1910.Who's Who, 1974, London : A. & C. Black, 1974, p.482 Career When the First World War broke out in 1914, he joined the Scottish Horse. This was a regiment in the Yeomanry, and it saw service in the Middle East, first at Gallipoli and then Egypt. Butler next gained a position in the Directorate of Military Operations in the War Office and ended the war serving in the general staff of the British forces in France. His service led to the award of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and he was twice mentioned in despatches. At the end of the war Butler returned to Cambridge. In 1922 he stood as a member of parliament for Cambridge University. His greatest achievement during his short tenure in the House of Commons was the passage of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Act 1922, which put into law the proposals of the Royal Commission established in 1919 to review the organisation and constitutions of the universities and the statutes of their colleges. He was defeated in the 1923 general election by his cousin Sir George Geoffrey Gilbert Butler. Promotion to tutor came in 1928, a lectureship in history in 1929 and then as senior tutor in 1931. However, another world war had intervened in his academic career. During the Second World War, Butler returned to military service in the Army Intelligence Corps, recruiting many former students including Bernard Willson to work on code breaking at Bletchley Park. From 1942 he worked in the field of civil affairs and military government, with particular focus on France. After the conclusion of hostilities, he was appointed editor United Kingdom Military Series of the History of the Second World War by the Prime Minister Clement Attlee. He was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History in 1947, holding the chair until 1954. He wrote two of the volumes concerning grand strategy published in that series. In 1958 he was given a knighthood for his work on the books.Who's Who, 1974, London : A. & C. Black, 1974, p.482 Butler resigned his chair in 1954 and was then appointed emeritus professor.

It is on the route of the East Coast Main Line and at one time had a station. The railway crosses over Croxdale Viaduct, built in 1872, just north of the village. The Weardale Way long distance footpath passes through the nearby Croxdale Hall estate. History Historic picture of railway at Croxdale The village originates from a small settlement around Croxdale Hall which is about half a mile to the north east of the modern village. First mentioned in records as Crokesteil in 1195 the name may come from a Viking named Krokr and the shape of the river bends that meander like a tail. Ownership of Croxdale dates back to 1291 when it was owned by a Roger Routhberi. By the early 15th century ownership had past to the Salvin family who still own Croxdale Hall and the surrounding estate to this day. Located just to the north of Croxdale (to the left of the A167) is Burn Hall which was designed and built in 1821 by Durham architect Ignatius Bonomi for the Salvin family. The cost of owning and maintaining two grand halls proved prohibitive and it was sold in 1926 to Roman Catholic missionaries who used it to train boys as missionary priests. In 1995 it was sold again and became luxury apartments. The modern village of Croxdale exists because of coal mining coming to the area. Croxdale Pit was opened in 1845. This venture was carried out by the Salvin family of Croxdale Hall but lasted only a few decades, closing by 1870. At this time St Bartholomew's church was built by Salvin for the miners who were attracted to work in the colliery. In exchange for the ancient chapel situated on the nearby Croxdale Estate, Gerard Salvin, Esq., gave the site of this church, the old chapel now being used as a mortuary chapel for the Salvin family. 1875 saw a return of coal mining as the Weardale Iron and Coal Company opened Croxdale Colliery just to the south of Sunderland Bridge. Housing was built to accommodate mine workers and their families, a Methodist Chapel completed in 1877 and a school built in 1878-79 (now the Community Centre) as well as St Bartholemew's being extended in 1878. The main streets in the new mining village were named after the people who provided the finance to build the housing, Salvin Street and Rogerson Terrace. So successful was the colliery that John Rogerson (one of the four directors of the Weardale Iron and Coal Company) rented Croxdale Hall from the Salvin family for a time. The colliery closed in 1934. Until 1938 Croxdale had a railway station served by the North Eastern Railway. During World War 2 the village was home to a munitions factory. After the war this became the NESS furniture factory. This closed in 2015. In early 2017 it was announced that the former factory would be converted into a business hub with offices, service yards and storage and distribution facilities. Community The village has a corner shop (formerly the village Post Office), two Public Houses: The Daleside, a traditional English style pub and The Croxdale Inn/Penash an Indian restaurant and bar and a working men's club. There is a play park for the children of the village which was funded by a series of summer fun days. The Church built in 1845 and dedicated to St. Bartholomew was built in the Norman style. It consists of nave, chancel, and western tower and is situated at the western extremity of the village of Sunderland Bridge. The Community Centre is in the old school hall. It hosts various clubs and acts as the polling station on election days.

Tibetans, in general, consider this temple as the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. The temple is currently maintained by the Gelug school, but they accept worshipers from all sects of Buddhism. The temple's architectural style is a mixture of Indian vihara design, Tibetan and Nepalese design. The Jokhang was founded during the reign of King Songtsen Gampo. According to tradition, the temple was built for the king's two brides: Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal. Both are said to have brought important Buddhist statues and images from China and Nepal to Tibet, which were housed here, as part of their dowries. The oldest part of the temple was built in 652. Over the next 900 years, the temple was enlarged several times with the last renovation done in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama. Following the death of Gampo, the image in Ramcho Lake temple was moved to the Jokhang temple for security reasons. When King Tresang Detsen ruled from 755 to 797, the Buddha image of the Jokhang temple was hidden, as the king's minister was hostile to the spread of Buddhism in Tibet. During the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to have been used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal taught in Jokhang. Around the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists have worked on the temple's design and construction. Location The temple, considered the \\"spiritual heart of the city\\" and the most sacred in Tibet, is at the center of an ancient network of Buddhist temples in Lhasa. It is the focal point of commercial activity in the city, with a maze of streets radiating from it. The Jokhang is east of the Potala Palace. Barkhor, the market square in central Lhasa, has a walkway for pilgrims to walk around the temple (which takes about 20 minutes). Barkhor Square is marked by four stone sankang (incense burners), two of which are in front of the temple and two in the rear. Etymology Rasa Thrulnag Tsuklakang (\\"House of Mysteries\\" or \\"House of Religious Science\\") was the Jokhang's ancient name. When King Songtsen built the temple his capital city was known as Rasa (\\"Goats\\"), since goats were used to move earth during its construction. After the king's death, Rasa became known as Lhasa (Place of the Gods); the temple was called Jokhang—\\"Temple of the Lord\\"—derived from Jowo Shakyamuni Buddha, its primary image. The Jokhang's Chinese name is Dazhao; it is also known as Zuglagkang, Qoikang Monastery Tsuglakhang and Tsuglhakhange. History Tibetans viewed their country as a living entity controlled by srin ma (pronounced \\"sinma\\"), a wild demoness who opposed the propagation of Buddhism in the country. To thwart her evil intentions, King Songtsen Gampo (the first king of a unified Tibet) developed a plan to build twelve temples across the country. The temples were built in three stages. In the first stage central Tibet was covered with four temples, known as the \\"four horns\\" (ru bzhi). Four more temples, (mtha'dul), were built in the outer areas in the second stage; the last four, the yang'dul, were built on the country's frontiers. The Jokhang temple was finally built in the heart of the srin ma, ensuring her subjugation. King Songtsen Gampo To forge ties with neighboring Nepal, Songtsen Gampo sent envoys to King Amsuvarman seeking his daughter's hand in marriage and the king accepted. His daughter, Bhrikuti, came to Tibet as the king's Nepalese wife (tritsun; belsa in Tibetan). The image of Akshobhya Buddha (or Mikyoba), which she had brought as part of her dowry, was deified in a temple in the middle of a lake known as Ramoche. Gampo, wishing to obtain a second wife from China, sent his ambassador to Emperor Taizong (627–650) of the Tang dynasty for one of his daughters. Taizong rejected the king's proposal, considering Tibetans \\"barbarians\\", and announced the marriage of one of his daughters to the king of Duyu, a Hun. This infuriated Gampo, who mounted attacks on tribal areas affiliated with the Tang dynasty and then attacked the Tang city of Songzhou. Telling the emperor that he would escalate his aggression unless the emperor agreed to his proposal, Gampo sent a conciliatory gift of a gold-studded \\"suit of armour\\" with another request for marriage. Taizong conceded, giving Princess Wencheng to the Tibetan king. When Wencheng went to Tibet in 640 as the Chinese wife of the king (known as Gyasa in Tibet), she brought an image of Sakyamuni Buddha as a young prince. The image was deified in a temple originally named Trulnang, which became the Jokhang. The temple became the holiest shrine in Tibet and the image, known as Jowo Rinpoche, has become the country's most-revered idol. The oldest part of the temple was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a location for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple was built on the filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama. The temple's design and construction are attributed to Nepalese craftsmen. After Songtsen Gampo's death, Queen Wencheng reportedly moved the statue of Jowo from the Ramoche temple to the Jokhang temple to secure it from Chinese attack. The part of the temple known as the Chapel was the hiding place of the Jowo Sakyamuni. During the reign of King Tresang Detsan from 755 to 797, Buddhists were persecuted because the king's minister, Marshang Zongbagyi (a devotee of Bon), was hostile to Buddhism. During this time the image of Akshobya Buddha in the Jokhang temple was hidden underground, reportedly 200 people failed to locate it. The images in the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were moved to Jizong in Ngari, and the monks were persecuted and driven from Jokhang. During the anti-Buddhist activity of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to be used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal who taught in Jokhang and died in 1054, found the \\"Royal Testament of the Pillar\\" (Bka' chems ka khol ma) in a pillar at Jokhang; the document was said to be the testament of Songtsen Gampo. Jokhang in the mid-1840s Beginning in about the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. It is said that the image of Buddha deified in the Jokhang is the 12-year-old Buddha earlier located in the Bodh Gaya Temple in India, indicating \\"historical and ritual\\" links between India and Tibet. Tibetans call Jokhang the \\"Vajrasana of Tibet\\" (Bod yul gyi rDo rje gdani), the \\"second Vajrasana\\" (rDo rje gdan pal) and \\"Vajrasan, the navel of the land of snow\\" (Gangs can sa yi lte ba rDo rje gdani). After the occupation of Nepal by the Gorkhas in 1769, during the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792 the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty drove the Gorkhas from Tibet and the Tibetans were isolated from their neighbors. The period, lasting for more than a century, has been called \\"the Dark Age of Tibet\\". Pilgrimages outside the country were forbidden for Tibetans, and the Qianlong Emperor suggested that it would be equally effective to worship the Jowo Buddha at the Jokhang. In Chinese development of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when the walkway around the temple was destroyed. An inner walkway was converted into a plaza, leaving only a short walkway as a pilgrimage route. In the square, religious objects related to the pilgrimage are sold. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this and the end of persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel. Two flagstone doring (inscribed pillars) outside the temple, flanking its north and south entrances, are worshiped by Tibetans. The first monument, a March 1794 edict known as the \\"Forever Following Tablet\\" in Chinese, records advice on hygiene to prevent smallpox; some has been chiseled out by Tibetans who believed that the stone itself had curative powers. The second, far older, pillar is high with a crown in the shape of a palace and an inscription dated 821 or 822. The tablet has a number of names; \\"Number One Tablet in Asia\\", \\"Lhasa Alliance Tablet\\", \\"Changing Alliance Tablet\\", \\"Uncle and Nephew Alliance Tablet\\" and the \\"Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet\\". Its inscription, in Tibetan and Chinese, is a treaty between the Tibetan king Ralpacan and the Chinese emperor Muzong delineating the boundary between their countries. Both inscriptions were enclosed by brick walls when Barkhor Square was developed in 1985. The Sino-Tibetan treaty reads, \\"Tibet and China shall abide by the frontiers of which they are now in occupation. All to the east is the country of Great China; and all to the west is, without question, the country of Great Tibet. Henceforth on neither side shall there be waging of war nor seizing of territory. If any person incurs suspicion he shall be arrested; his business shall be inquired into and he shall be escorted back\\". According to the Dalai Lama, among the many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was believed to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994) to facilitate conservation efforts. The temple is listed in the first group of State Cultural Protection Relic Units, and has been categorized as a 4A-level tourist site. On February 17, 2018, the temple caught fire at 6:40 p.m. (local time), before sunset in Lhasa, with the blaze lasting until late that evening. Although photos and videos about the fire were spread on Chinese social media, which showed the eaved roof of a section of the building lit with roaring yellow flames and emitting a haze of smoke, these images were quickly censored and disappeared. The official newspaper Tibet Daily briefly claimed online that the fire was \\"quickly extinguished\\" with \\"no deaths or injuries\\" at the late night, while The People's Daily published the same words online and added that there had been \\"no damage to relics\\" in the temple; both of these reports contained no photos. The temple was temporarily closed after the fire but were reopened to public on February 18, according to official Xinhua news agency. But the yellow draperies had been newly hung behind the temple's central image, the Jowo statue. And no one was allowed to enter the second floor of the temple, according to the source of Radio Free Asia's Tibetan Service. The fire burned an area of about 50 square meters. The temple's golden cupola had been removed to guard against any collapse and protective supports had been added around the Jowo statue, according to Xinhua. On February 19, 2018, the Dalai Lama's supporters based in India reported eyewitness accounts that \\"the source of the fire is not the Jowo chapel but from an adjacent chapel within the Jokhang temple premises known in Tibetan as Tsuglakhang\\" and confirming that there were \\"no casualties and damage to property is yet to be ascertained\\". Architecture Plan of the complex from Journey to Lhasa and Central Tibet by Sarat Chandra Das, 1902 Jokhang temple courtyard, 2013 The Jokhang temple covers an area of . When it was built during the seventh century, it had eight rooms on two floors to house scriptures and sculptures of the Buddha. The temple had brick-lined floors, columns and door frames and carvings made of wood. During the Tubo period, there was conflict between followers of Buddhism and the indigenous Bon religion. Changes in dynastic rule affected the Jokhang Monastery; after 1409, during the Ming dynasty, many improvements were made to the temple. The second and third floors of the Buddha Hall and the annex buildings were built during the 11th century. The main hall is the four-story Buddha Hall. Gilt roof of the Jokhang The temple has an east-west orientation, facing Nepal to the west in honour of Princess Bhrikuti. Additionally, the monastery's main gate faces west. The Jokhang is aligned along an axis, beginning with an arch gate and followed by the Buddha Hall, an enclosed passage, a cloister, atriums and a hostel for the lamas (monks). Inside the entrance are four \\"Guardian Kings\\" (Chokyong), two on each side. The main shrine is on the ground floor. On the first floor are murals, residences for the monks and a private room for the Dalai Lama, and there are residences for the monks and chapels on all four sides of the shrine. The temple is made of wood and stone. Its architecture features the Tibetan Buddhist style, with influences from China, Indian vihara design and Nepal. The roof is covered with gilded bronze tiles, figurines and decorated pavilions. Temple interior The central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch leads to the open courtyard, which is two concentric circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, with a number of large prayer wheels (nangkhor); this path leads to the main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king's Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled crown, cover around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his left hand on his lap and his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future). Incarnations of Sakyamuni are enshrined on either side of a central axis, and the Buddha's warrior guard is in the middle of the halls on the left side. In addition to the main hall and its adjoining halls, on both sides of the Buddha Hall are dozens of chapels. The Prince of Dharma chapel is on the third floor, including sculptures of Songtsen Gampo, Princess Wencheng, Princess Bhrikuti, Gar Tongtsan (the Tabo minister) and Thonmi Sambhota, the inventor of Tibetan script. The halls are surrounded by enclosed walkways. Decorations of winged apsaras, human and animal figurines, flowers and grasses are carved on the superstructure. Images of sphinxes with a variety of expressions are carved below the roof. The temple complex has more than 3,000 images of the Buddha and other deities (including an image of the Buddha) and historical figures, in addition to manuscripts and other objects. The temple walls are decorated with religious and historical murals. Traditional prayers and prostrations in front of the Jokhang On the rooftop and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer flanking a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish. The temple interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal. In addition to walking around the temple and spinning prayer wheels, pilgrims prostrate themselves before approaching the main deity; some crawl a considerable distance to the main shrine. The prayer chanted during this worship is \\"Om mani padme hum\\" (Hail to the jewel in the lotus). Pilgrims queue on both sides of the platform to place a ceremonial scarf (katak) around the Buddha's neck or touch the image's knee. A walled enclosure in front of the Jokhang, near the Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet, contains the stump of a willow known as the \\"Tang Dynstay Willow\\" or the \\"Princess Willow\\".

He began the Parliament Square Peace Campaign before the 2001 United States attacks, and became a symbol of the anti-war movement over the policies of both the United Kingdom and the United States in Afghanistan and later Iraq. At the 2007 Channel 4 Political Awards he was voted Most Inspiring Political Figure. Haw died of cancer in Berlin, where he had been receiving medical treatment. Early and personal life Haw was born on 7 January 1949,Jerome Taylor, \\"3,000 days and counting...

He grew up in neighbouring Barking and in Whitstable, Kent.Brian Haw obituary, Telegraph.co.uk; accessed 15 June 2017. His father, Robert William Haw (1925–1964), served as a sniper in the Reconnaissance Corps in the Second World War, and had been one of the first British soldiers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He later worked as a railway clerk, and also worked in a betting office. He committed suicide by gassing himself when Haw was 13. Haw's mother was Iris Marie Haw (née Hall). Haw's family were involved in an evangelical Christian church in Whitstable, which Haw joined when he was aged 11. Haw was apprenticed to a boat-builder from the age of 16 and then entered the Merchant Navy as a deckhand.Anna Pukas, \\"I'm staying I won't let Blair bully me'\\", The Express, 11 May 2006. He travelled widely before spending six months at evangelical college in Nottingham, after which he preached world peace. Haw visited Northern Ireland in 1970 during The Troubles, as well as the Killing Fields of Cambodia in 1989. Back in London, he worked as a removals man and as a carpenter. He married his wife Kay in Redbridge in June 1977, and they lived in Redditch with their seven children until he left them in 2001 to begin his Parliament Square protest. The couple divorced in 2003. Haw worked with troubled youngsters in Redditch, Worcestershire. Parliament Square protests Brian Haw, February 2007 Brian Haw, September 2005 On 2 June 2001, he began camping in Parliament Square in central London in a one-man political protest against war and foreign policy (initially, the Economic sanctions against Iraq). By his own account, he was first inspired to take up his vigil after seeing the images and information produced by the Mariam Appeal, an anti-sanctions campaign. Haw justified his campaign on a need to improve his children's future. He only left his makeshift campsite to attend court hearings, surviving on food brought by supporters. Support for Haw's protest came from former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn and activist/comedian Mark Thomas. Among the artwork displayed was a Banksy stencil of two soldiers painting over a peace sign and Leon Kuhn's anti-war political caricature 3 Guilty Men, which, together with Kuhn's The Proud Parents, Mark Wallinger later displayed in his recreation at the Tate in 2007. He originally camped on the grass in Parliament Square, but the Greater London Authority took legal action to remove him, so he relocated to the pavement, which was administered by Westminster City Council instead. In October 2002 Westminster City Council attempted to prosecute Haw for causing an obstruction to the pavement, but the case failed as Haw's banners did not impede movement. The continuous use of a megaphone by Haw led to objections by Members of Parliament who had offices close to Haw's protest camp. The House of Commons Procedure Committee held a brief inquiry in summer 2003 which heard evidence that permanent protests in Parliament Square could provide an opportunity for terrorists to disguise explosive devices, and resulted in a recommendation that the law be changed to prohibit them. The Government passed a provision banning all unlicensed protests, permanent or otherwise, in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (sections 132 to 138); however, because Haw's protest was on-going and residing on Parliament Square prior to the enactment of the Act, it was unclear whether the Act applied to him. Brian Haw, Parliament Square, 3 January 2009 In the 2005 general election Haw stood as a candidate in the Cities of London and Westminster in order to further his campaign and oppose the Act which was yet to come into force. He won 298 votes (0.8 percent), making a speech against the ongoing presence of UK troops in Iraq at the declaration of the result. =Legal action= Brian Haw's Parliament Square Peace Campaign, January 2002 As preparation for implementing the new Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 began, Haw won an application for judicial review on 28 July 2005, successfully arguing that a technical defect in the act meant it did not apply in his case. The act states that demonstrations must have authorisation from the police \\"when the demonstration starts\\", and Haw asserted that his demonstration had begun before the passage of the act, which was not made retrospective. Although the commencement order made to bring the act into force had made reference to demonstrations begun before the act came into force, there was no power for the commencement order to extend the scope of the act. The government appealed against the judgement, and on 8 May 2006 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and therefore declared that the act did apply to him. The court found that the intent of parliament was clearly to apply to all demonstrations in Parliament Square regardless of when they had begun, saying \\"The only sensible conclusion to reach in these circumstances is that Parliament intended that those sections of the Act should apply to a demonstration in the designated area, whether it started before or after they came into force. Any other conclusion would be wholly irrational and could fairly be described as manifestly absurd.\\"Haw, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2006] EWCA Civ 532. England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Decisions. 8 May 2006. In the meantime Haw had applied for permission to continue his demonstration, and received it on condition that his display of placards was no more than wide (among other things). Haw was unwilling to comply and the police referred his case to the Crown Prosecution Service; a number of supporters began camping with him in order to deter attempts to evict him. Foreign Policy 2000, a painting by Abby Jackson – one of the items confiscated by the police In the early hours of 23 May 2006, 78 police arrived and removed all but one of Haw's placards citing continual breached conditions of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 as their reason for doing so.Anti- war signs seized by police. BBC News Online. 23 May 2006.Tempest, Matthew (23 May 2006). Police seize Parliament Square protester's placards. The Guardian. Ian Blair (head of the Metropolitan Police at the time) later said that the operation to remove Haw's placards had cost £27,000. The actions of the police were criticised by members of the Metropolitan Police Authority at its monthly meeting on 25 May 2006. Haw appeared at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 30 May, when he refused to enter a plea. The court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, and he was bailed to return to court on 11 July 2006. At a licensing hearing at Westminster City Council on 30 June 2006, Haw was granted limited permission to use a loudspeaker in the space allowed to him. On 22 January 2007 Haw was acquitted on the grounds that the conditions he was accused of breaching were not sufficiently clear, and that they should have been imposed by a police officer of higher rank. District Judge Purdy ruled: \\"I find the conditions, drafted as they are, lack clarity and are not workable in their current form.\\"Parliament protester's legal win. BBC News Online. 22 January 2007. At the 2007 Channel 4 Political Awards Haw was voted Most Inspiring Political Figure.Channel 4 award for Brian Haw, The Daily Telegraph, 8 February 2007 =Documentary= Haw was featured in several documentaries including 2003's \\"As Long As It Takes\\" (Raj Yagnik) and the 2006 documentary, TerrorStorm. Director and narrator Alex Jones interviewed Haw and even joined in his protest of Parliament by answering Haw's inquiry, via megaphone, about the Statue of Liberty by saying she had been picked up on suspicion that she was a member of Al-Qaeda. Haw was briefly portrayed in the 2007 drama The Trial of Tony Blair. Haw was filmed for many months by independent documentary maker Senara Wilson during the buildup to war in 2003. Her film Life of Brian (produced and edited by Matthew Platts-Mills) was selected for the Commonwealth Film Festival. A short version of this documentary is available here. A Man Called Brian was a 2005 documentary film by Mahmoud ShoolizadehA review of Life of Brian, Bpmedia.org; accessed 15 June 2017. about Haw and his ten-year, 24/7 anti-war protest in Parliament Square. Haw was featured with activist Mick Meaney in a documentary by British independent news agency RINF, in which for the first time in the media he stated that he believed \\"9/11 was an inside job\\". Director of Public Prosecutions v Haw In the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Haw, the judgement of the court, delivered by Lord Phillips CJ, included the following: This was an adjourned hearing of an appeal by way of case stated by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a decision of District Judge Purdy in the City of Westminster Magistrates Court on 22 January 2007. The judge ruled that there was no case for the Respondent, Brian Haw, to answer on a charge of knowingly failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 134 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 ('SOCA') in respect of a demonstration in Parliament Square. The hearing before the Administrative Court was adjourned because Mr Haw had not been served with relevant documents in time to give them proper consideration. Haw sought a large number of directions from the court on 18 November 2008. After some delay the directions of the court were eventually published in March 2009: * Haw, R (on the application of) v Southwark Crown Court & Ors [2009] EWHC 379 (Admin) (3 March 2009) The court was un-persuaded that a full transcript of the hearing was necessary, even though Haw claimed that it would show that the court sidestepped the issue as to the legality of the seizure. Tucker v Director of Public Prosecutions The case of Tucker v Director of Public Prosecutions, 2007 was an appeal by way of case stated. The appellant, Barbara Tucker, was convicted under Section 132 (1)(c) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA), of being within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, and carrying on unauthorised demonstration by herself in a public place in a designated area, namely Parliament Square. Her defence was that Haw had invited her to join him in his demonstration. He gave evidence on her behalf to that effect. The magistrate said: \\"Had I accepted this evidence (which I did not) it would have been argued that the allegation that she had 'carried on an unauthorised demonstration by herself ...' could not have been made out, and furthermore (in my view incorrectly) that it would provide a defence by saying that as Mr Haw is safe from prosecution anyone who joins him is also safe.\\" The question posed by the magistrate was: \\"Was it lawful under section 6 (1) HRA to convict the appellant?\\" The Administrative Court held that SOCPA was not incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (specifically, Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of assembly)), and that Tucker's conviction was therefore lawful. January 2008 injury and arrest On 12 January 2008, Haw was observing a protest against the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act outside Downing Street. Seven people were arrested including Haw, who said \\"I was filming the students lying down in the road when one officer stepped forward, as I was walking back, and pushed the camera with his hand. It struck my face.\\" He accused the police of using \\"violent and humiliating force\\". 2008 London mayoral elections In December 2007 press releases stated that Haw had declared himself a candidate in the London Mayoral Elections in May 2008, but eventually he did not stand. On 17 April 2008 he gave his support to the Christian Choice candidate Alan Craig. 25 May 2010 arrest On 25 May 2010 the day of the State Opening of Parliament for the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, Haw was arrested at 8:30 am. Illness and death In September 2010 Haw was diagnosed with lung cancer. On 1 January 2011 he left England to receive treatment in Berlin. Haw, who was described as a chain smoker, continued to smoke cigarettes until his death.\\"Mr. Haw who camped for 10 years in London's Parliament Square; dies at age 62 years\\", by Nadeem Iftekhar at The Lahore Times Haw died in Germany in the early hours of 18 June 2011 of lung cancer. He is survived by seven children. Reacting to news of Haw's death, Tony Benn said \\"Brian Haw was a man of principle ... his death marks the end of a historic enterprise by a man who gave everything to support his beliefs\\". At his death Al Jazeera described him as an \\"unsung hero\\". Mark Wallinger said \\"I admired [Haw's] single-minded tenacity. His rectitude was a mirror that the people in the building opposite couldn't bear. ... Now that he's gone, who else have we got?\\". The British MP John McDonnell has called for a statue of Haw to be assembled to celebrate peace. British artist Banksy honoured Haw with a tribute on his website. London Assembly Member Jenny Jones called for Westminster Council to erect a blue plaque for Brian Haw immediately, bypassing English Heritage's criteria that the person commemorated should have been dead for two decades or passed the centenary of their birth, whichever is the earlier. In culture In January 2007, former Turner Prize nominee Mark Wallinger recreated Brian Haw's Parliament Square protest in its entirety as an exhibition at Tate Britain, titled State Britain. Running the length of the Duveen Gallery, State Britain was a painstaking reconstruction of the display confiscated by the Metropolitan Police in 2006. It included 500 weather-worn banners, photos, peace flags, and messages from well-wishers collected by Haw over the duration of the Peace Protest, as well as his self-constructed shelter. In December 2007 Wallinger's work won the Turner Prize. The London- based band XX Teens recorded a song \\"For Brian Haw\\", which was included on their 2008 album Welcome To Goon Island. The track incorporated a statement by Haw himself about his motivations for the protest. Haw was featured in the short length documentary Maria: 24hr Peace Picket by Iranian film director Parviz Jahed, about fellow peace campaigner Maria Gallastegui. In 2009, Youth Music Theatre UK developed the music theatre production According to Brian Haw... based on reactions by young people to Haw's life, 9/11 and the Iraq war.

It lies close to the confluence of the River Wear and River Browney. Sunderland Bridge originally carried the Great North Road (A1) across the River Wear, and probably dates back to the 14th century. It is built of dressed sandstone with four semicircular arches. The bridge has undergone several rebuilds, with the end arches being rebuilt in 1770, the parapets widened in 1822, and new end walls built in the 19th century. It is a grade I listed structure. When a new bridge was needed as the existing bridge was not wide enough to cope with traffic, Croxdale Bridge was constructed to the east of the existing bridge. The A1 at this point was later re-designated as the A167, and Croxdale Bridge continues to carry this road. Sunderland Bridge now carries very little road traffic after Durham County Council closed off the old route of the Great North Road at local request. It allows access to the private Croxdale estate and a sewage works. The bridge also forms part of the Weardale Way long distance footpath.

Early life and career  Amilakhvari was born in Bazorkino (now Chermen, North Ossetia–Alania, Russian Federation), where his family had moved from their ancestral estate at Gori, Georgia during the Russian Revolution of 1905. The house of Zedginidze-Amilakhvari had formerly served as hereditary Master of the Horse to the Georgian Crown (Amilakhvari) and retained their princely dignity during the Imperial Russian rule of Georgia. Dimitri's grandfather, Ivane Amilakhvari (1829–1905), was an eminent general in the Russian army. His father, Colonel Giorgi Zedginidze-Amilakhvari, also served in the Russian military and transferred his loyalty to the short-lived Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918-21. After the Russian SFSR occupied Georgia early in 1921, the family fled to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dimitri attended a local British School, and later, in 1922, emigrated to France. In 1924, Dimitri Amilakhvari entered the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and was commissioned as a second lieutenant after his graduation in 1926. At the same time, he was posted to the French Foreign Legion and promoted to lieutenant in 1926. He later served in French North Africa and took part in all important operations in the south of Morocco from 1932 to 1933. From 1934 to 1939, he was Head of the French military school in Agadir, being promoted to captain in 1937. Following his naturalisation as a French citizen, he married another member of the exiled Georgian nobility, Princess Irina, née Dadiani (1904–1944) in August 1927. Note that during his French service, the spelling of his surname was modified, dropping the 'h'. By his wife, Amilakhvari had three children, sons Georges and Othar, and daughter Thamar Amilakhvar,Offspring all of whom married and had offspring.Amilkhvari offspring  World War II  Captain Amilakhvari (2nd from right) with French soldiers, 1941. During the \\"Phoney War\\" before the German occupation of France, Amilakhvari was serving in Algiers in North Africa, but in the spring of 1940 he joined the French expeditionary force earmarked for the Norwegian Campaign. He fought at Narvik and was then evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he joined the Free French Forces. He then took part in the unhappy campaigns against the Vichy French forces in West Africa, at Dakar (in Senegal), and Equatorial Africa, in Cameroun. In a remarkable record of service, his war service in 1940 had thus taken him from Africa to the Arctic Circle and back again, as far as the Equator, all in the space of a few months. Amilakhvari's next move took him halfway round the continent to Eritrea, in East Africa, to join the East African Campaign against Italy in early 1941, but by the summer he was on the move again, to take part in another campaign against Vichy France (with units of the French Foreign Legion serving on both sides of the conflict), in Syria. This would be the closest he would come to the land of his birth. Amilakhvari then assumed command of the 13th Demi-Brigade of Foreign Legion on 6 September 1941. In 1942, Amilakhvari was back in North Africa, facing the German and Italian forces in Libya as part of the North African Campaign. During the hard fighting at Bir-Hakeim (January) he wrote: \\"We, foreigners, have only one way to prove to France our gratitude: to be killed ...\\". Nevertheless, he survived, and in June he was made a Companion of the Liberation, a decoration second only to the Légion d'honneur. In 1942 he was also awarded the Krigskorset med Sverd or Norwegian War Cross with Sword for his earlier service in Norway. This is Norway's highest military decoration for gallantry and he was one of only 66 Frenchmen awarded this decoration during the Second World War. In October 1942, the Allies began the final offensive in North Africa with the Second Battle of El Alamein. This battle took the Allied forces right across Libya and into French North Africa, where Amilakhvari had begun his operational service. However, Amilakhvari did not live to complete his great African odyssey, as he was killed in action on the second day of the battle. In May 1940 Amilakhvari was awarded a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (Légion d'honneur). Later, General Charles De Gaulle named him and his legionaries the \\"honour of France\\" for their heroic defence of the Allies' positions.

It was designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson for the 3rd Marquess in the late 1870s, replacing an earlier house by Alexander McGill, which burnt down in 1877. The house is a Category A listed building. Background The house is the seat of the Stuarts of Bute, derived from the hereditary office \\"Steward of Bute\\" held since 1157. The family are direct male-line descendants of John Stewart, the illegitimate son of King Robert II of Scotland, the first Stuart King, by his mistress, Moira Leitch. By virtue of this descent, they are also descendants of Robert the Bruce, whose daughter Marjorie was mother of Robert II by her marriage to Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland. History Chapel interior The original house was built in 1719 for The 2nd Earl of Bute, but was rebuilt for The 3rd Marquess of Bute following a fire on 3 December 1877. After his earlier creations of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch in Cardiff, the Marquess used many of the builders and workman he had employed in South Wales, including William Burges and much of that architect's team. Burges built an oratory at the house. The main part of the present house is a flamboyant example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture, built in a reddish-brown stone. Mount Stuart's major features include the colonnaded Marble Hall at the centre of the main block and the Marble Chapel, which has an elaborate spired tower which is the tallest part of the building. Two earlier wings in a strikingly different style survive. They are much smaller in scale, have Georgian-style sash windows and are painted white. Much of the furniture was custom-designed for the house by Robert Weir Schultz in the early years of the 20th century. He also laid out many sections of the gardens. The Mount Stuart House claims to be home to the world's first heated pool in any house; it was the first home in Scotland to be lit by electricity and so may have been the first to have a heated pool. However the tradition of fire-heated encasements and pool water in British houses goes back to the Roman era.Ancient Roman bathing The house holds The Bute Collection, a private collection of artwork and artefacts The Collection also houses archives, books, furniture, and silverwork reflecting the interests of the Bute family's various generations, including 25,000 books on topics including theology, botany, agriculture and Scottish history and literature. In April 2016 it was announced that a Shakespeare First Folio had been discovered in the House's Library. The folio belonged to Isaac Reed. The house is open to the public.

Tetri Giorgi and the Seven Celestials – 1918 design of the emblem of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Tetri Giorgi (, \\"White George\\") is one of the local names of Christian Saint George in Georgia, specifically in the country’s northeastern highland districts. Tetri Giorgi was used as a national symbol, as part of Georgia's coat of arms in the years 1918-1921 and 1991-2004. The name of Tetri Giorgi has also been adopted by several political and non- political organizations, significantly by an anti-Soviet Georgian émigré group in Europe and a 1990s paramilitary unit.  History  Saint George was venerated in Georgia since Late Antiquity. The exonym Georgia was applied to the country from the 11th or 12th century, probably by false etymology, but inspired by the great popularity of the saint there. The cult of Tetri Giorgi is associated with the Kakheti region in particular. It is syncretistic, combining the Christian saint with the cult of a local lunar deity.Yarshater, Ehsan (ed., 1983), The Cambridge history of Iran, pp. 533-534.

A feast day of Tetri Giorgi (tetrigiorgoba) separate from the feast day of the Christian saint was once marked annually on 14 August, when many pilgrims from the eastern Georgian provinces attended an overnight feast at the saint's chief shrine – a 14th-century church overlooking the village Atsquri in what is now Akhmeta Municipality, Kakheti. http://www.folk.ge/index.php?section=164⟨_id=geo&info;_id=551 თეთრი გიორგი (Tetri Giorgi)].

Retrieved on April 30, 2009  In heraldry  In May 1918, the Democratic Republic of Georgia – newly independent from the Russian Empire – chose the equestrian depiction of Tetri Giorgi as a centerpiece of its coat of arms. But the image was rendered more secular as its Christian symbolism was disfavored by Georgia's Social-Democratic government, recalls Revaz Gabashvili, a critic of the contemporary Georgian government.

The route passes through downtown Saint Paul. Route description Looking east on MN 5 into Victoria, MN State Highway 5 serves as a northeast- southwest route between Gaylord, Norwood Young America, Chanhassen, Eden Prairie, Bloomington, Richfield, downtown Saint Paul, and Maplewood. The State Highway runs thought 5 counties. The highway is officially marked as an east- west route by its highway shields from beginning to end. Part of Highway 5 is designed as a freeway near the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. Just to the west of that segment, Highway 5 runs concurrent with I-494 for between its junction with I-494 near the Airport and the Minnesota River to its junction with I-494 and U.S. 212 in Eden Prairie. Highway 5 is considered a significant transit corridor, known as the Riverview Corridor, to downtown Saint Paul from the airport and points farther south and west. There has been discussion of creating a bus rapid transit or light rail line along the highway, much like the METRO Blue Line currently runs rails into downtown Minneapolis along State Highway 55. Highway 5 is also known as Fort Road and West 7th Street in the city of St. Paul. of Highway 5 is officially designated the Augie Mueller Memorial Highway. This designation is signed from its intersection with State Highway 101 in Chanhassen southwesterly to its intersection with State Highway 19 in Gaylord. Legally, State Highway 5 is defined as legislative routes 45, 52, 102, 109, 111, and 121 in the Minnesota Statutes. The route is not marked with those numbers. History State Highway 5 was authorized in 1934. The route was completely paved by 1953. When Highway 5 was slated for expansion in 1956, the construction threatened to demolish the remains of historic Fort Snelling, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. As a result of public outcry, the highway was built in a short tunnel underneath the Fort Snelling site, sparing the fort from destruction. This effort led to archaeological research into the remains of Fort Snelling and its eventual rebuilding as a state park. From 1934 to 1982, the eastern section of the highway between Saint Paul and Stillwater was originally marked as Minnesota 212, as it once reached old U.S. 212 in Saint Paul, but that segment was re-numbered as an extension of Highway 5 circa 1983. This segment is still marked with the mileposts from 212, which were a continuation of those from U.S. 212. In the concurrency with I-494, the MN 5 shield is placed at most, but not all, interchanges. In 2007, new gore signs placed on France Avenue in Bloomington at its interchange with I-494 do not mention the Highway 5 concurrency, whereas the older signs they replaced did. The more recent interchange with Lyndale Ave (2009) displays the names of both highways. In June 2015, it was announced that Highway 5 will be shortened by 8.3 miles by the state of Minnesota, giving the portion from Minnesota 120 to its eastern conterminous at Minnesota 36 to Washington County. The road is known as 34th St. between Jamaca Ave and Highway 120 and Stillwater Blvd. between Jamaca Ave. and Highway 36. The road is an extension of Washington County Roads 14 and 15. This road is designated from the county line to Manning Ave. as County Road 14 and from Manning Ave. to Highway 36 as County Road 15. This piece of the highway that will be returned to the county was originally marked as Minnesota 212. This portion of highway is now marked with county highway signs as well as Old Highway 5 signs.

Overview The language borrows concepts familiar to anyone using statically typed languages like Java, COBOL, C, etc. However, it borrows the concept of stereotype from Unified Modeling Language (UML) that is not typically found in statically typed programming languages. In a nutshell, EGL is a higher-level, universal application development language. EGL is similar in syntax to other common languages so it can be learned by application developers with similar previous programming background. EGL application development abstractions shield programmers from the technical interfaces of systems and middleware allowing them to focus on building business functionality. EGL applications and services are written, tested and debugged at the EGL source level, and once they are satisfactorily functionally tested they can be compiled into COBOL, Java, or JavaScript code to support deployment of business applications that can run in any of the following environments: *Platforms with a Java virtual machine, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX, for example in the context of a Java EE servlet container (IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, GlassFish) *IBM System z: CICS Transaction Server, IMS, z/OS Batch, UNIX System Services, WebSphere Application Server, z/VSE, Linux *IBM System i: IBM i5/OS, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, Integrated Web Application Server for i *Web browsers supporting JavaScript, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, for Ajax rich web applications  Code examples  = Program = An EGL Program part is a generatable logic part with one entry point. Each Program part contains a main() function, which represents the logic that runs at program start up. A program can include other functions and can access functions that are outside of the program. The function main() can invoke those other functions. Program functions are composed of a set of EGL statements, variables, and constants. Program HelloWorld const GREETING string = \\"Hello, \\"; function main() myName string = \\"John\\"; sayHello(myName); end function sayHello(name String in) SysLib.writeStdOut(GREETING + name + \\"!\\"); end end = Record = An EGL Record part defines a set of data elements. In this example, a record with the name CustomerRecord is defined with 6 fields. Record CustomerRecord type BasicRecord customerNumber INT; customerName STRING; customerAddr1 STRING; customerAddr2 STRING; customerAddr3 STRING; customerBalance MONEY; end EGL has a specialized type of record called SQLRecord that is used to exchange data with a relational database. record Employee type sqlRecord { tableNames =\\"Employee\\", keyItems =[EMPNO]} EMPNUMBER string{ column = \\"EMPNO\\", maxLen = 6}; FIRSTNME string{ sqlVariableLen = yes, maxLen = 12}; MIDINIT string{ isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 1}; LASTNAME string{ sqlVariableLen = yes, maxLen = 15}; DEPT string{ column = \\"WORKDEPT\\", isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 3}; PHONENO string{ isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 4}; HIREDATE date{ isSqlNullable = yes}; end * In this example, the record Employee is bound to a table (or view) named Employee. = Service = An EGL Service part contains public functions meant to be accessed from other applications or systems. In this example, a service with two functions is defined. package com.mycompany.services; service EmployeeService function getEmployees() returns(Employee[]) records Employee[0]; // define an empty array of records get records; // retrieve records from the database return (records); // return the records end function addEmployee(emp Employee in) returns (boolean) try add remp; return (true); onException (ex AnyException) return (false); end end end * In EGL, code is organized in packages (like Java (programming language)) * The first function, getEmployees, returns an array of records populated from the records in a database. * The second function, addEmployee adds a new record to the database and returns a true or false depending on whether the record was added successfully. = RUIHandler = The main component of a Rich UI application is a Rich UI handler part. These parts are generated into JavaScript. package com.mycompany.ui; import com.mycompany.services.Employee; import com.mycompany.services.EmployeeService; import dojo.widgets.DojoGrid; import dojo.widgets.DojoGridColumn; handler EmployeeView type RUIhandler { initialUI = [ grid ], onConstructionFunction = start, cssFile = \\"main.css\\" } grid DojoGrid { behaviors = [ ], headerBehaviors = [ ], columns = [ new DojoGridColumn { displayName = \\"First Name\\", name = \\"FIRSTNAME\\" }, new DojoGridColumn { displayName = \\"Last Name\\", name = \\"LASTNAME\\" }, new DojoGridColumn { displayName = \\"Salary\\", name = \\"SALARY\\" } ] }; function start() svc EmployeeService { }; call svc.getEmployees () returning to displayEmployees; end function displayEmployees(retResult Employee [ ] in) grid.data = retResult as any [ ]; end end  Web 2.0 with EGL  In December 2008, IBM introduced new technology, EGL Rich UI, to simplify the creation of Web 2.0-style Rich Internet Applications. This technology simplifies development by hiding the complexities of Ajax, JavaScript, REST, and SOAP from the developer, which enables them to focus on the business requirement and not on the underlying technologies.

Originally published in 1971 with a cover by Norman Weaver, it was the last of MacLean's novels to be written in first-person narrative. This novel is a murder mystery with the added twist that the scene of the crimes is Bear Island, an island in the Svalbard archipelago of the Norwegian Arctic. Plot summary A converted fishing trawler, Morning Rose carries a movie-making crew across the Barents Sea to isolated Bear Island, well above the Arctic Circle, for some on-location filming, but the script is a secret known only to the producer and screenwriter. En route, members of the movie crew and ship's company begin to die under mysterious circumstances. The crew's doctor, Marlowe, finds himself enmeshed in a violent, multi-layered plot in which very few of the persons aboard are whom they claim to be. Marlowe's efforts to unravel the plot become even more complicated once the movie crew is deposited ashore on Bear Island, beyond the reach of the law or outside help. The murders continue ashore, and Marlowe, who is not what he seems to be either, discovers they may be related to some forgotten events of the Second World War. Reception The Observer called it \\"highly impossible, highly readable.\\" The Los Angeles Times called it \\"the best adventure MacLean has written for some time. It will make a whopping good movie.\\" Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The novel sold over 8 million copies. Bear Island was adapted to film in the 1980 movie directed by Don Sharp and starred Donald Sutherland, Richard Widmark, Vanessa Redgrave, and Christopher Lee. The film was shot in Canada and Alaska, and the scenery bears little resemblance to Bear Island. Furthermore, the plot and characterization of the novel were greatly altered by the scriptwriters, to the point of changing the name of the protagonist from \\"Marlowe\\" to \\"Lansing\\".

He was the son of Martiros Kanayan, the head of the Kanayan clan in Igdir, and his wife, Horom. At an early age, Martiros enrolled his son to the parish school of Igdir. Drastamat would skip school to hang out near the military barracks of Igdir because of his interest in the military exercises held there. Igdir at the time was an important military post where between 8000 and 10000 Russian troops were stationed including infantry, Cossacks, cavalry and border guards. Most of the inhabitants of the village thrived by trading with the soldiers. Noticing that his son had no interest in books and learning, Martiros pulled him out of the village school and enrolled him to the Yerevan Gymnasium school. Drastamat was no better in the Gymnasium school as the grades he achieved were barely enough for a promotion. Like all government schools in the provinces of Russia, there was a policy of Russification that limited education in the Armenian language to religion only. Inspired by stories of General Andranik's triumphs in the Ottoman Empire and the spread of nationalism by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Drastamat joined a secret youth movement in his school that opposed the Czar's government and promoted Armenian nationalism. =Edict on Armenian church property= On 12 June 1903, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong Armenian opposition because it perceived the Tsarist edict as a threat to the Armenian national existence. As a result, the Armenian leadership decided to actively defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and holding mass demonstrations. This prompted Drastamat to join the ranks of the Dashnaktsutiun in order to defend churches from confiscation through public demonstrations and guard duty. World War I Staff of Armenian volunteers; Khetcho, Drastamat Kanayan, and Karekin Pastermadjian, 1914 He served as detachment commander in the Russian Caucasus Army during World War I. He was one of the commanders of the Armenian volunteer units and decorated by the Tsar. General Dro, third from the right, leading the second battalion in 1915 In November 1914, he had the second battalion of the Armenian volunteers. At the Bergmann Offensive, the second battalion of the Armenian volunteers engaged in battle for the first time, near Bayazid. In the course of a bloody combat which lasted twenty-four hours, Dro, commander of the battalion, was seriously wounded. From that day to March of the following year, he remained in critical condition, but his battalion led into eleven battles in the neighborhood of Alashkert, Toutakh, and Malashkert, until Dro recovered and returned to resume the command. Kanayan had already become a popular military leader after the victories over the Ottoman Empire at the Caucasus Campaign. Between March 1918 and April 1918 he was appointed by the Armenian National Council military commissar to the occupation of Turkish Armenia of the Ararat region. He was the commander of the Armenian forces in the Battle of Bash Abaran. First Republic of Armenia Kanayan on horseback From 24 November to 2 December 1920, Kanayan was the Defence Minister of the short-lived First Republic of Armenia and commanded Armenian troops in various successful wars. The last battles against the Ottoman Empire at the Caucasus Campaign essentially saved the Armenian Republic from total destruction. As a Defence Minister before the end of 1918, he took responsibility at the Armenian–Azerbaijani War and Georgian–Armenian War. Later in 1920, Turkish–Armenian War. In 1920, after the establishment of the Soviet regime in Armenia, Drastamat Kanayan remained in the country. He was exiled with 1,200 officers of the Republican army in January 1921; he later went to Moscow, finally settling in Romania in 1925. =Armenian–Azerbaijani War= In 1920, Drastamat Kanayan advanced to the vicinity of Shushi.Richard G. Hovannisian, \\"Historical Memory and Armenian-Azerbaijani Relations\\", The Armenian Perspective, 14 September 2000 On the night from 21–22 March 1920, when the Azerbaijanis were celebrating Novruz Bayram, the Armenians of Karabakh revolted and organized a surprise attack.Richard G. Hovannisian. The Republic of Armenia, Vol. III: From London to Sèvres, February–August 1920, During these clashes thousands of people from both the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides were killed, with more than 7,000 houses burned, with Shusha virtually cleansed of its Armenian population. In April 1920, the Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army informed from the Drastamat Kanayan to leave Karabagh. Karabagh-Zangezur was on the break of armed confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Drastamat Kanayan knew that if he did not comply with this demand the Red Army and the armed forces of Azerbaijan would have to act jointly. He was forced to withdraw due to the Sovietization of Azerbaijan and the assurances given by the emissaries of Sergo Ordzhonikidze regarding a just solution to the Karabagh conflict. On 26 May 1920, the 10th Congress of the Armenian National Council of Karabagh, which took place in Taghavard village, proclaimed the change of position. The \\"Armenian National Council of Karabagh\\" was replaced with The Revolutionary Committee of Nagorno Karabagh, headed by S. Hambartsumian. That same day, Kanayan along with his units was forced to leave Karabagh. World War II During World War II, the Dashnak separatists saw a good opportunity in split from the Soviet Union and create an Armenian nation in a post-World War II world dominated by the Axis powers. On 8 February 1942, they formed a Legion of 11 battalions from those Armenians, who were prisoners in the Nazi POW camps and had opted to fight for German forces rather than face the genocidal conditions of those camps. The Legion was 18,000-strong and had been known as Armenische Legion, while the 812th Armenian Battalion of Wehrmacht as each battalion of this unit, had 1,000 men under the command of Kanayan. The Legion was trained by Wehrmacht officers and participated in the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and the Caucasus.The banality of denial: Israel and the Armenian genocide, Yair Auron, p. 238, According to Joris Versteeg, the total number of Armenians serving in the German armed forces during the war was 18,000: 11,000 were placed in field battalions, while 7,000 were placed in logistic and non-combat units. Ailsby puts the number at 11,600. After World War II, Kanayan emigrated to the United States and continued his political activities with the purpose of advancing the Armenian Cause. In 1947, at the World Congress of the A.R.F., he was forgiven for his collaboration with Nazis, as he could justify it with powerful arguments, and was again elected a member of the Party.Drastamat Kanayan profile , membres.lycos.fr/armenianlegion Death, burial, and legacy With the end of World War II, Drastamat Kanayan was arrested by American forces, but soon released. Kanayan settled within the large Armenian Diaspora of Lebanon. When traveling to the U.S. for medical treatment, he died in Watertown on 8 March 1956. His remains were taken to Armenia for final burial in Aparan, on 28 May 2000, within the commemoration of the 82nd anniversary of the First Republic of Armenia. The government of Armenia founded the General Dro National Institute of Strategic Studies, and the Ministry of Defense established a medal in his name to decorate military personnel and civilians who excelled in military teaching. Kanayan was survived by his wife Gayane (whom he married in Bucharest in 1935) and their son Mardiros (Martin).

The nonrelativistic theory was developed by Tullio Regge in 1959. Details The simplest example of Regge poles is provided by the quantum mechanical treatment of the Coulomb potential V(r) = -e^2/(4piepsilon_0r) or, phrased differently, by the quantum mechanical treatment of the binding or scattering of an electron of mass m and electric charge -e off a proton of mass M and charge +e. The energy E of the binding of the electron to the proton is negative whereas for scattering the energy is positive. The formula for the binding energy is the well-known expression :Erightarrow E_N = - frac{2m'pi^2e^4}{h^2N^2(4piepsilon_0)^2} = - frac{13.6 eV}{N^2}, ;; m^' = frac{mM}{M+m}, where N = 1,2,3,..., h is the Planck constant, and epsilon_0 is the permittivity of the vacuum. The principal quantum number N is in quantum mechanics (by solution of the radial Schrödinger equation) found to be given by N = n+l+1, where n=0,1,2,... is the radial quantum number and l=0,1,2,3,... the quantum number of the orbital angular momentum. Solving the above equation for l, one obtains the equation :lrightarrow l(E) = -n +g(E), ;; g(E) = -1+ifrac{pi e^2}{4piepsilon_0h}(2m'/E)^{1/2}. Considered as a complex function of E this expression describes in the complex l-plane a path which is called a Regge trajectory. Thus in this consideration the orbital momentum can assume complex values. Regge trajectories can be obtained for many other potentials, in particular also for the Yukawa potential.Harald J.W. Müller-Kirsten: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Schrödinger Equation and Path Integral, 2nd ed., World Scientific (2012) pp. 395-414 Regge trajectories appear as poles of the scattering amplitude or in the related S-matrix. In the case of the Coulomb potential considered above this S-matrix is given by the following expression as can be checked by reference to any textbook on quantum mechanics: : S = frac{Gamma(l-g(E))}{Gamma(l+g(E))}e^{-ipi l}, where Gamma(x) is the gamma function, a generalization of factorial (x-1)!. This gamma function is a meromorphic function of its argument with simple poles at x=-n, n=0,1,2,.... Thus the expression for S (the gamma function in the numerator) possesses poles at precisely those points which are given by the above expression for the Regge trajectories; hence the name Regge poles. History and implications The main result of the theory is that the scattering amplitude for potential scattering grows as a function of the cosine z of the scattering angle as a power that changes as the scattering energy changes: : A(z) propto z^{l(E^2)} where l(E^2) is the noninteger value of the angular momentum of a would-be bound state with energy E. It is determined by solving the radial Schrödinger equation and it smoothly interpolates the energy of wavefunctions with different angular momentum but with the same radial excitation number. The trajectory function is a function of s=E^2 for relativistic generalization. The expression l(s) is known as the Regge trajectory function, and when it is an integer, the particles form an actual bound state with this angular momentum. The asymptotic form applies when z is much greater than one, which is not a physical limit in nonrelativistic scattering. Shortly afterwards, Stanley Mandelstam noted that in relativity the purely formal limit of z large is near to a physical limit — the limit of large t. Large t means large energy in the crossed channel, where one of the incoming particles has an energy momentum that makes it an energetic outgoing antiparticle. This observation turned Regge theory from a mathematical curiosity into a physical theory: it demands that the function that determines the falloff rate of the scattering amplitude for particle- particle scattering at large energies is the same as the function that determines the bound state energies for a particle-antiparticle system as a function of angular momentum. The switch required swapping the Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the energy, for t, which is the squared momentum transfer, which for elastic soft collisions of identical particles is s times one minus the cosine of the scattering angle. The relation in the crossed channel becomes : A(z) propto s^{l(t)} which says that the amplitude has a different power law falloff as a function of energy at different corresponding angles, where corresponding angles are those with the same value of t. It predicts that the function that determines the power law is the same function that interpolates the energies where the resonances appear. The range of angles where scattering can be productively described by Regge theory shrinks into a narrow cone around the beam-line at large energies. In 1960 Geoffrey Chew and Steven Frautschi conjectured from limited data that the strongly interacting particles had a very simple dependence of the squared- mass on the angular momentum: the particles fall into families where the Regge trajectory functions were straight lines: l(s)=ks with the same constant k for all the trajectories. The straight-line Regge trajectories were later understood as arising from massless endpoints on rotating relativistic strings. Since a Regge description implied that the particles were bound states, Chew and Frautschi concluded that none of the strongly interacting particles were elementary. Experimentally, the near-beam behavior of scattering did fall off with angle as explained by Regge theory, leading many to accept that the particles in the strong interactions were composite. Much of the scattering was diffractive, meaning that the particles hardly scatter at all — staying close to the beam line after the collision. Vladimir Gribov noted that the Froissart bound combined with the assumption of maximum possible scattering implied there was a Regge trajectory that would lead to logarithmically rising cross sections, a trajectory nowadays known as the pomeron. He went on to formulate a quantitative perturbation theory for near beam line scattering dominated by multi-pomeron exchange. From the fundamental observation that hadrons are composite, there grew two points of view. Some correctly advocated that there were elementary particles, nowadays called quarks and gluons, which made a quantum field theory in which the hadrons were bound states. Others also correctly believed that it was possible to formulate a theory without elementary particles — where all the particles were bound states lying on Regge trajectories and scatter self-consistently. This was called S-matrix theory. The most successful S-matrix approach centered on the narrow-resonance approximation, the idea that there is a consistent expansion starting from stable particles on straight-line Regge trajectories. After many false starts, Richard Dolen, David Horn, and Christoph Schmid understood a crucial property that led Gabriele Veneziano to formulate a self-consistent scattering amplitude, the first string theory. Mandelstam noted that the limit where the Regge trajectories are straight is also the limit where the lifetime of the states is long. As a fundamental theory of strong interactions at high energies, Regge theory enjoyed a period of interest in the 1960s, but it was largely succeeded by quantum chromodynamics. As a phenomenological theory, it is still an indispensable tool for understanding near-beam line scattering and scattering at very large energies. Modern research focuses both on the connection to perturbation theory and to string theory.

In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration. Background =Russian revolution= 10 ruble banknote of the Transcaucasian Commissariat After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government installed the Special Transcaucasian Committee to govern the area. However, following the October Revolution, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was replaced on 11 November 1917 by the Transcaucasian Commissariat centered in Tbilisi. The Commissariat concluded the Armistice of Erzincan with the Ottoman Empire on 5 December 1917, ending localized armed conflict with the Ottoman Empire. The Commissariat actively sought to suppress Bolshevik influence while concurrently pursuing a path towards Transcaucasian independence from Bolshevik Russia. This included establishing a legislative body, the Transcaucasian Sejm, to which the Commissariat surrendered its authority on 23 January 1918, following the dispersal of the Russian Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks. The secessionist and anti-Bolshevik agenda eventfully brought Transcaucasian into conflict with the central government. On 3 March, the Russians signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marking Russia's exit from World War I. In the treaty, Russia agreed to return territory gained during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), giving little care to the fact that this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces. The Trebizond Peace Conference, between the Ottoman Empire and the Sejm, began on 4 March and continued until April. The Ottomans offered to surrender all the Empire's ambitions in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the re-acquisition of the east Anatolian provinces awarded at Brest-Litovsk. =Independence= During the peace conference negotiations, the Ottoman representatives placed a great deal of pressure on the Transcaucasian delegation to declare independence, as they were only willing to sign a treaty with Transcaucasian if they were independent from Russia. The Transcaucasian Sejm recalled its representatives on 31 March to discuss the Ottoman position. On 5 April, the head of the Transcaucasian delegation Akaki Chkhenkeli accepted the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a basis for future negotiations. The Sejm also declared formal independence from Soviet Russia by proclaiming the establishment of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic on 22 April. Hostilities nevertheless resumed between the new republic and the Ottoman Empire, and by 25 April the Ottoman army had taken control of Kars and largely returned to its pre-war positions. On 11 May, a new peace conference between the Republic and the Ottoman Empire began in Batumi. At the conference the Ottomans further extended their demands to include Tbilisi, Alexandropol and Echmiadzin. The Ottoman army resumed hostilities on 21 May with the Battle of Sardarabad, Battle of Bash Abaran and Battle of Kara Killisse. alt=A crown of approximately 40 men standing on a set of steps in front of stone balcony By this point, leading Georgian politicians viewed an alliance with Germany as the only way to prevent Georgia from being occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Consequently, the Georgian National Council declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia on 24 May and two days later signed the Treaty of Poti with Germany, placing itself under German protection. The following day, the Muslim National Council announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Having been largely abandoned by its allies, the Armenian National Council declared its independence on May 28. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasus states, bringing the conflict with the Ottoman Empire to an end. The treaty awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenia Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans but did not firmly delineate the borders between the new Transcaucasus states. In response, and to deny the Ottomans a direct route to Tbilisi, Georgian units supported by German officers took possession of northern Lori and established outposts along the Dzoraget River. =Initial clashes= alt=Approximately 4 soldiers, some of whom are armed, posing in front of a heavily armoured train car. In early October 1918, the Ottomans pulled back from southern Lori, which eliminated the territorial buffer between Armenia and Georgia. The Armenian military quickly filled the void by taking control of much of southern Lori on 18 October and in the absence of any resistance probed further north. The first incident between Armenia and Georgia occurred the same day when an Armenian army detachment seized the railway station in the village of Kober near Tumanyan, refusing a subsequent demand from the Germans that they withdraw. The local border guards called for help, and the Georgian government responded by sending two armoured trains and a detachment of 250 soldiers, which forced the Armenians to leave Kober. Five days later, three Armenian companies attacked and overwhelmed a German garrison near the village of Karinj. Earlier, the Georgian government in Tbilisi had received a letter from Armenian Prime Minister Hovhannes Kajaznuni insisting that Georgia had no claims on the Lori district, and for the sake of avoiding a catastrophic crisis for both countries, Georgian troops should leave the region. Clashes intensified from 25–27 October, with neither side gaining the advantage, until the Georgians sent a company-sized force with an armoured train to support their German allies. Just a day later, the Georgian government received a telegram from Armenia explaining that the attacks were the result of a misunderstanding and proposed that a conference be convened to resolve the border issue. On 27 October, Armenian troops left the two villages, they had occupied, and retreated south. =Failed diplomatic attempts= The terms of the Armistice of Mudros between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies required the Ottomans pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus. The departure of the Ottomans created a power vacuum in the border area, in particular that between Armenia and Georgia. Armenia and Georgia began bilateral talks in November 1918, with Georgia sending a special envoy to Yerevan. Simultaneously, Georgia invited the recently independent governments of the Caucasus to Tbilisi for a conference with the principal aim of addressing boundary delimitation and issues of common concern. The general idea of a conference was well received by the Armenian government, however, the Armenia government took exception to the scope and quick timelines of the conference. In particular, Armenia was not interested in discussing border issues at a conference. Armenia indicated it would participate, recognizing the rapidly changing political environment following World War I, but reemphasized that they would not discuss the issues of delimitation. In general, however, Georgia was of the position that the border with Armenia should be inline with the border of the former Russian imperial Tiflis Province; whereas, Armenia was of the position that the border should correspond to ethnic composition or more historical boundaries. The conference began in Tbilisi on 10 November with only the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus in attendance. The Armenia delegation initially stated that they were unable to attend due to poor rail service between Yerevan and Tbilisi. The Georgian delegation suggested that the conference start be postponed until 13 November to accommodate, but Armenia declined for several reasons, including the lack or readiness and clarity on several issues. The Armenian delegation continued to postpone, and in order to accommodate the Armenians, Georgia first postponed the start of the conference to 20 November and then to 30 November. After the final delay, the conference fell apart, and five days later, on 5 December, the Georgian mission headed by Simon Mdivani left Yerevan. Georgia subsequently informed Armenia of its willingness to exclude the discussion of boundary disputes from a conference program but Armenia once again delayed a response, allegedly due to sabotage of telegraph lines. Prior to leaving Yerevan, the Mdivani mission did engage in talks with the Armenia government during which Armenia indicated a readiness to give up claims in Akhalkalaki and Borchalo if the Georgians would help them in either retaking Karabakh or assist with historical territorial claims within Western Armenia. The Georgian government, however, declined such offers, as they did not wish to become entangled in another conflict with the Ottoman army. Amidst failed negotiations, Georgia deployed troops in the villages near the border which only increased the tenseness of the situation. Open hostilities =Armenian offensive= Armenian troops in 1918 In early December 1918, the Georgians were confronted with regional rebellion in the Lori area, chiefly in the village of Uzunlar. The local garrison in the village of Uzunlar was attacked by disgruntled local villagers, resulting in one Georgian soldier being killed and the remaining soldiers being disarmed and taken prisoner. The Georgians argued that Armenian soldiers from the 4th Infantry Regiment had disguised themselves as bandits and were fomenting rebellion; whereas, Armenia took the position that the events were the result of Georgia's oppressive behavior towards the local ethnic-Armenian population. In response, General Varden Tsulukidze sent a 200-soldier detachment to the area to quell the unrest. The detachment was, however, unable to provide any relief, as they were driven back by heavy gunfire. Borchali/Lori district Still not realising the actual scale of the threat he was facing, Tsulukidze's headquarters in Sanahin was quickly approached and besieged by regular Armenian army units resulting in heavy fighting around the railway station. The Armenians sabotaged rails and also succeeded in ambushing and trapping an armoured train that was carrying two Georgian infantry companies. Tsulukidze withdrew from Sanahin to Alaverdi — which was also being attacked by Armenian forces, using the artillery of the derailed trains to cover his troops' retreat. More Georgian reinforcements arrived on December 12, securing the heights around Alaverdi, but were unsuccessful in breaking out the ~60 Georgians who remained trapped on the rails between the two villages. Another train with reinforcements got derailed on the same day. At that point, the Georgians had less than 700 troops engaged in combat, while most of them took defensive positions in Alaverdi, equipped with a few guns and mortars. On December 14, they were encircled by an estimated 4,000 Armenian soldiers from regiments of the 1st and 2nd Rifle Divisions. Confronted with a hopeless situation, General Tsulukidze ordered a general retreat and made a successful breakout towards Sadakhlo. Simultaneously, from 12 to 14 December, Georgian forces under General Tsitsianov were struck by Armenian troops around the villages of Vorontsovka and Privolnoye. On 12 December, the National Guard detachment that was guarding Vorontsovka was called back to Tbilisi to participate in a military parade marking the 1st anniversary of the National Guard of Georgia. Tsitsianov's few hundred men, although heavily outnumbered, offered brutal resistance with their artillery, using shrapnel ammunition at point-blank range. The Armenians eventually managed to take both towns. The Georgian forces, having suffered more than 100 killed by that point, and some material, retreated towards Katharinenfeld. On December 14, the Armenians, who had already amassed more than 6,500 regular troops supported by thousands of armed local militia, steamrolled what resistance remained in the Alexandrovka- Vorontsovka-Privolnoye triangle. By the end of the second day of that attack, the Armenian army had captured almost all of the contested villages. Sanahin and Alaverdi also fell. Georgian defenders and refugees started to evacuate the area by train on December 17. The Georgians sustained heavy losses, leaving behind hundreds of prisoners, one train and both derailed armoured trains. The Armenian army's left flank, commanded by colonels Nikogosov and Korolkov, performed decisive flanking manoeuvers that surprised and encircled the Georgians in Ayrum and culminated in the capture of the town on December 18. Despite a successful breakout, the Georgian 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments lost around 560 men killed, wounded or taken prisoner, and about 25 machine guns and two cannons in total. On the same day, the Armenian vanguard pushed against Sadakhlo, where Tsulukdize's forces had fortified themselves at the station and nearby strategic heights. The initial Armenian attack was repulsed, and in order to outflank the defenders, the town of Shulaveri was captured the next day. Korolkov called for all Armenian men in the area able to fight to mobilize and support the army's offensive. On 20 December, the Armenians were blockading a vital train station that connected Sadakhlo with Tbilisi, preventing further reinforcements. A day after, they massed their artillery and launched an attack on the town, only to be repulsed with heavy casualties by the defenders, who were equipped with an armoured train. Using the same train, the remaining Georgian troops broke out of the encirclement to join a defensive line further north. Following that defeat, Tsulukidze resigned and was replaced by General Sumbatashvili. The Georgian army was already mobilizing in the Lori district and started to prepare for major counterattacks.Armeno-Georgian War of 1918 and Armeno-Georgian Territorial Issue in the 20th Century, Andrew AndersonThe Republic of Armenia Volume I: 1918-1919, Richard G. HovannisianINDEPENDENT GEORGIA (1918-1921), David Marshall Lang Akhalkalaki district Less significant were the clashes in the Akhalkalaki district. The Armenian operation was thwarted by the massive Georgian military presence and lack of support by the local Armenian population. The region was garrisoned with over 6,000 troops commanded by general Abel Makashvili. Despite the odds, Armenian forces mounted an offensive, seizing four villages. Makashvili demanded they leave the area immediately otherwise punitive actions would take place. On 14 December the Armenians met the demand and left the villages, only to renew their attacks a few days later, this time around with cavalry support. The village of Troitskoe changed hands several times until the Georgians ultimately retook it and repelled all Armenian units from the area. On 19 December Armenian forces once again attempted to take Troitskoe but were repulsed, losing 100 men to Georgian machine gun fire. Due to heavy winter storms, neither side could achieve any military breakthrough in the region. Confrontations in the Akhalkalaki district ceased for the rest of the war while all Georgian troops there had to remain, on the order of high command, despite the critical situation in Lori. =Georgian counterattack and end of hostilities= Battles at Katharinenfeld and Shulaveri =Katharinenfeld= The Armenian army kept advancing and occupied most Armenian dominated villages in the Lori/Borchali province, then proceeded to enter the town Bolnisi-Knachen near heavily fought Katharinenfeld and rested only a few dozen kilometers away from the Georgian capital. Even though attacking Tbilisi was not a primary goal for the Armenians it was an alarming immediate threat to the Georgian government. The mobilization order was not issued earlier than December 18 and approved only 2 days later. Commander Jugheli was put in charge of the ill- disciplined Georgian National Guard troops in Katharinenfeld while general Akhmetashvili was appointed commander in chief of the Georgian army forces in the Lori theatre. Jugheli's 600 men encamped in a poorly and carelessly organised position without even posting guards allowing Armenian militia to sneak up on them overnight and capture several cannons and machineguns and position themselves on the roofs to surprise the Georgians. However, despite the momentum the Armenians had gained, the Georgians with Jugheli leading them while under attack managed to recapture the equipment in close combat and forced the Armenians out of town, but with heavy casualties, losing 30 killed and 70 wounded. The Armenians also suffered heavy losses during retreat with 100 killed and 100 taken prisoner when they were run down by Georgian cavalry led by Colonel Cholokashvili. Georgian troops crossed the river Khrami with the first main objective to crush the Armenian force in the Dagheti-Samshvilde area. The Armenian troops including 500 well-entrenched militia were engaged by Georgian artillery and on 24 December the villages Dagheti, Bolnisi, Khacheni and Samshvilde were captured by the Georgian army eliminating most of the resistance in the process. =Recapture of Shulaveri and stalemate= Georgian cavalrymen in 1918 armed with carbines and sabres With the expulsion of Georgian troops under Tsulukidze from Sadakhlo the Armenians were effectively controlling most of the contested areas within the Borchali/Lori district, except Katharinenfeld which the Georgians had retaken. Following the demand of general Dro, who directly threatened an attack beyond the Khram and indirectly an attack on Tbilisi if the Georgians didn't concede and officially transfer the Akhalkalaki district to Armenia, the Georgians quickly switched from a defensive posture to offensive operations. The Georgian government appointed their most respected military leader general Mazniashvili commander in charge of the planned Shulaveri operation while being supported by generals Kvinitadze and Sumbatashvili. On December 24 the Armenians defending the railway station Ashaga-Seral were surprised and overwhelmed by a Georgian cavalry charge supported by artillery fire from an armoured train. Just hours later Georgian infantry entered several villages and Little Sulaveri and secured a railway bridge while a single battalion cleared the strategic mountain between Ashaga and Shulaveri. Those actions allowed the general staff to move closer to the frontline at the station. General Dro's forces maintained the initiative as they had the superior numbers and positions while the Georgians were still amassing sufficient force to mount decisive attacks. Instead Mazniashvili resorted to deep outflanking manoeuvers by single local infantry and cavalry detachments to prevent a coordinated Armenian advance while the main army was still assembling. If the Armenians had launched an attack before the Georgian army arrived in full force, nothing would have prevented them from taking Tbilisi. Mazniashvili's plan was to distract with diversionary flanking manoeuvers that threatened Shulaveri and the strategically important railway connection. The Armenian commanders responded by deploying and concentrating the bulk of their army in and around Shulaveri taking up defensive positions and mobilising all available forces to oppose a potential Georgian assault on the town. Mazniashvili had succeeded with his plan. He focused what available troops he had at hand, around 1000 men, for several simultaneous attacks on the flanks seizing a number of villages around Shulaveri on December 25. To the north of Shulaveri a Georgian National Guard battalion secured a mountain directly facing the town providing a decisive strategic stronghold that oversaw most of the area. An Attack on Shulaveri itself followed almost instantly carried out by artillery and two Georgian aircraft which dropped bombs on the Armenian positions. The general assault was scheduled for the next day on December 26. However the battalion that was supposed to guard the mountain, left it to resupply and rest as its soldiers felt uncomfortable to rest on the mountain itself. As a result, the Armenians retook it, only to be repulsed on the same day. Paradoxically exactly the same event occurred shortly after. The Georgians once again left the mountain for the same reason losing it a third time. The commander in charge of the battalion resigned due to the behaviour of his men. As a consequence the operation was postponed until December 27. Mazniashvili attempted to take Shulaveri with a frontal attack personally leading the assault but was repelled by the Armenian defenders. A day later the Armenians got reinforced by another regiment and the Georgian army followed by a 2-hour artillery barrage renewed its offensive with around 3,500 men and was able to seize the strategic heights east of the town which put them in an advantageous position. Shulaveri was retaken by nightfall on the same day while the Georgian general staff entered the town on December 29. Suffering almost 200 killed and many wounded the Armenian army split in two groups and retreated. One of the groups heading towards Sadakhlo along the railway line was intercepted and scattered by Georgian cavalry. The other group fell back to the village of Sioni. 24 hours later on 30 December the Georgians seized Sadakhlo after it changed hands several times and the village Lamballo. Unaware and not timely informed by the government of a scheduled ceasefire that would begin on 1 January 1919, Mazniashvili had planned another major offensive but not earlier than January 1. The Armenians on the other hand were informed and had already prepared to retake Sadhaklo and Lamballo on December 31 and got reinforced for that operation. In the subsequent fighting on 31 December neither side achieved its goals. The Armenians were able to take Lamballo once again but failed to take Sadakhlo entrenching themselves at the nearby railway station while the Georgians kept hold of the town itself. The Georgians on the other side were not able to retake Lamballo after several attempts even when reinforced. Both armies rested on irregular lines. On 1 January 1919 hostilities ceased and the two nations' army commanders held peace talks which continued in Tbilisi. The conflict was officially ended on January 9 with the involvement of a British special envoy. Aftermath Both parties signed a peace agreement in January 1919 brokered by the British. Armenian and Georgian troops left the territory and both sides agreed to begin talks on designating a neutral zone. The neutral zone was divided between the Armenian SSR and Georgian SSR in 1921.

A garmon has two rows of buttons on the right side, which play the notes of a diatonic scale, and at least two rows of buttons on the left side, which play the primary chords in the key of the instrument as well as its relative harmonic minor key. Many instruments have additional right-hand buttons with useful accidental notes, additional left-hand chords for playing in related keys, and a row of free- bass buttons, to facilitate playing of bass melodies. The garmons can be of two major classes: unisonoric, meaning that each button plays the same note or chord when the bellows is being expanded as it does when compressed, and bisonoric, in which the note depends on the direction of the bellowswork. Examples of unisonoric type are livenka (ливенка, after Livny, Oryol Oblast) and Khromka (, for \\"chromatic\\"). Bisonoric garmons are, e.g., Tula accordion (, after Tula) and talyanka (тальянка, \\"Italian\\") Beside Russian folk music, the garmon is an important musical instrument for Caucasian (Ossetian, Azeri, Armenia, Georgian, Cherkess, etc.) and Mari folk in Volga and Ural regions. It's also used in popular music. Known also as the Harmonika (see Steirische Harmonika) it is very popular in Slovenia. Modern music is also played on the Garmon, with some artists achieving popularity in Europe and the United States of America. The Slovenian style of play differs from the Russian. There are over 300 popular ensembles in Slovenia, one ensemble often consisting of several singers and an accordionist, the musicians very often being young or middle-aged.  Keyboard arrangement  Although reduced and expanded versions are widely available, the standard arrangement (known as \\"25 × 25\\") is as follows: *25 treble buttons in two rows: Three diatonic octaves plus three accidentals. *25 bass buttons in three rows: Two rows of eight buttons, with bass notes and chords; one free-bass row. =Right Hand= The treble keyboard is arranged so that a scale may be played by alternating between the two rows. The low and high octaves have identical fingering, while the middle octave differs. The three accidental notes are arranged so as to mirror the position of the left-hand chords that contain them.center =Left Hand= The bass keyboard is arranged so that the principal chords for the major key are in the outer row, placed in circle of fifths order; the principal chords for the harmonic minor key are in the middle row; free bass notes are in the inner row. One free bass accidental note is included.center  Russian types  Since the introduction of the accordion from Germany to Russia in the 1830s, Russian masters invented a lot of different types of local garmons during the 19th and 20th centuries. = Khromka = Russian khromka, made in the Tula musical factory in the 20th century. Khromka () was invented in 1870 in Tula on the design of Russian musician Nikolay Beloborodov. It was a unisonoric (like bayan or piano accordion) diatonic accordion but on the right keyboard there was also two or three chromatic buttons, usually g1♯, d2♯, f2♯, so hence the name khromka came as it was virtually chromatic. It became the most popular and widespread button accordion in Russia, so almost all modern Russian (as well as Soviet) garmons (usually made in Tula and Shuya factories) are khromkas. = Tula garmon = Tula garmon () was the first Russian accordion, which began to be manufactured since the 1830s. It had five or seven buttons on the right keyboard, and like in the most Western diatonic accordions it produced different sounds on pull and push. So Tula garmon had two full diatonic octaves (from C4 to C6). The left bass keyboard had two buttons. Tula garmon was a base for all the Russian diatonic bisonoric garmoshkas (Saratov, Kasimov etc.) = Vyatka garmon = Nikolay Beloborodov's chromatic piano accordion, 1878. Vyatka garmon () first appeared on the factories of Vyatka governorate in the middle of the 19th century. It was chromatic unisonoric, it had a piano keyboard on the right side and two bass buttons on the left one. Vyatka garmon was a prototype for many different types of national accordions in the Volga region and the Caucasus (see below). Also after it there were made Russian diatonic and chromatic accordions: Elets \\"royal\\" (means with a piano keyboard, because in Russian a grand piano is called royal’) garmon, Beloborodov's royal garmon (made by Tula master Chulkov in the 1870s on the design of Beloborodov, it had a full chromatic right keyboard and resembled modern piano accordions) and others. =Saratov garmon= Saratov garmon () is a diatonic bisonoric garmoshka with bells which ring when the bass and chord keys are played. Lidia Ruslanova sang to the accompaniment of this garmonika. = Livenka = Livenka () or Livenskaya garmoshka () was developed during 1860-1870s in the factories around the town of Livny (Oryol Oblast).  Asian and Caucasian garmons  Russian garmons were popular not only among the Russians but also among the other nations of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Almost all the national garmons are based on Tula, Vyatka and Khromka garmons with modifications needed to fit the local national musical traditions. Some were professionally invented in musical factories in the 20th century. = Volga, Ural and Siberian regions = * Mari accordion (marla-karmon) is seven-button diatonic bisonoric, based on Tula garmon. * Mari koga-karmon and Chuvash kubos based on Khromka. = Caucasian = Phændur or Ossetian accordion was developed on the base of European accordion. It was designed for the features of Ossetian folk musik but then the other Caucasians found it relevant and the instrument became popular all over the Caucasus. = Oriental accordion = An Oriental bayan produced in the Tula musical factory some 30 years ago. Oriental bayan or accordion was invented in 1936 in the Kazan musical factory, it has a right- hand piano keyboard but a little smaller, so in fact it imitates a piano accordion. In 1961 in the Kazan factory it was revised and the left keyboard mirrored the right one, though the left buttons are not rectangular but round like in button accordions. This type is popular in music of Azerbaijan, where it is known as the qarmon and has been popularized in Turkey through the recordings of Nejat Özgür.Sarhoşluğu kalplerinde yaşayanların mihmandarı: Sermest = Georgian/Armenia = * Garmoni came to Georgia and Armenia from Europe, namely, from Russia in the 1830s and immediately became popular among folk musicians. It is especially popular in Tusheti, where it is used as an accompanying instrument (together with vocals) and also as a solo instrument. * Buzika is a kind of small accordion widespread especially among the mountain inhabitants of Georgia, with its own distinct sound. It is considered a women's instrument, and often a bride was presented with a buzik at the time of her engagement. It was widely used for national holidays, festivals, and parties, and is associated mainly with song and dance melodies. It is also sometimes used for performing solo melodies, or in an ensemble with a doli (drum), daira, diplipito, and panduri. * Tsiko-tsiko came to Georgia and Armenia from Europe in the 1830s, and mainly accompanies dances.

He was the father of Canadian General John de Chastelain.  Early life and stay in Romania  Mr and Mrs de Chastelain in 1945 Born in London in February 1906, of Anglo-Scottish parents and of Huguenot background, he was educated in Scotland and the University of London, from which he received a First Class degree in Engineering. On graduation, he moved to Romania and worked for Unirea (a British Petroleum branch) in Bucharest, rising to a managerial position towards the end of the 1930s. While in Bucharest, he married Marion Elizabeth Walsh, the daughter of Jack Walsh, an American accountant with Standard Oil of New Jersey in Romania. Wartime activities with the SOE  On the outbreak of war with Nazi Germany, de Chastelain was commissioned into the Artists' Rifles and became a member of Special Operations Executive (SOE), with which organisation he conducted sabotage operations in the Balkans and served in the North African campaign. In late 1943, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he led a team of two other SOE members (Ivor Porter and Silviu Meţianu) by parachute into Romania (Operation Autonomous), to test the possibility of the country's surrender to the Allies as the Axis was losing battles on the Eastern Front (see Romania during World War II). Captured by the Romanian Gendarmerie soon after their landing near Plosca, Teleorman County, he and his team were taken into custody as prisoners of war and held in a Bucharest apartment.Duţu et al. They were all released in August 1944, when Conducător Ion Antonescu was overthrown and King Michael I assumed full powers (see King Michael Coup). Decorated, de Chastelain was demobilised after the war, joining a unit of the Special Air Service in the Territorial Army. Life in the post-war era After the start of the Cold War, Soviet authorities alleged that he was keeping contacts with Iuliu Maniu, the leader of the National Peasants' Party; the latter had opposed both Antonescu's regime and the Soviet occupation of Romania. During Maniu's trial for treason (1947), the Minister of the Interior, Teohari Georgescu, was handed a report which indicated Maniu's alleged contacts with de Chastelain as proof that the politician was a British spy.Pokivailova & Chiper, pp. 48–49 Alongside a group of partners, de Chastelain started Griffin Enterprises (1945), a business centered in London and Kent, dealing in film processing, import and exports and other activities. In 1954, he left that business to accept a post as Vice-President of the Canadian branch of an American oilwell drilling and services company, H. J. Eastman, in Calgary, Alberta. Living for several years in Canada and then in Australia, he returned to Canada in the early 1970s and died in Calgary at the age of 68. A book giving an account of the SOE Operation in Romania was written by one member of the team, Ivor Porter, later a British Ambassador (Operation Autonomous: With SOE in Wartime Rumania, Chatto and Windus, 1989). He was a founding member of the Special Forces Club in Knightsbridge, and of the Food and Wine Society in Calgary.

He was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Archdeacon William Hancock. At the age of nine, he won the Royal Humane Society's medal for rescuing another child from drowning in the Mitchell River. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and later the University of Melbourne where he was resident at Trinity College from 1917, winning the Perry Scholarship, Trinity's most prestigious award.\\"Trinity College Scholarships\\", The Argus, 17 Dec. 1916, p. 5. Too young to see service in World War I without permission from his parents, it was said that he always felt shame about the fact he could not fight. As the Australia-at-large Rhodes Scholar for 1921, Hancock went to Balliol College, Oxford in 1922. He graduated in 1924 with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in Modern History. He then became the first Australian to gain a Fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford in 1923. After returning to Australia he was Professor of Modern History at the University of Adelaide between 1924 and 1933. On his appointment he was aged only 25, the youngest professor in the British Commonwealth, and one who had held no previous teaching post.Australian Dictionary of Biography In 1930 he published Australia, a book which was well received and notable for its ironic tone, particularly in criticism of Australian institutions such as tariff protection, was highly influential, and is still frequently quoted today. From 1934 to 1944 Hancock was the Professor of History at University of Birmingham and during this war period was also appointed to the War Cabinet Offices. His Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs was published in three volumes in 1937–42. In 1941 he was appointed Supervisor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of the History of the Second World War and was thereafter editor of the series. In 1949, with Margaret Gowing, he wrote The British War Economy, the introductory volume to that series. Between 1944 and 1949, he returned to Oxford, becoming Chichele Professor of Economic History. During the War he also played a role in Civil Defence, serving as a firewatcher. He was knighted in 1953, partially for his services in writing and editing the histories. In 1949 he left Oxford, taking up an appointment as the Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies. He served as the Professor of British Commonwealth Affairs at the University of London until 1956. During this period he was sent as a government expert to examine constitutional questions in Uganda in 1954, at the height of the Kabaka crisis. At this time he began work on his authoritative biography of the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, which appeared in two volumes in 1962 and 1968, and editing for publication, with Jean van der Poel, the first four volumes of the Smuts papers. Hancock returned to Australia in 1957 to take up an appointment as Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University, a position he held until 1961. He was Professor of History at the Institute of Advanced Studies, ANU until his retirement in 1965. On his retirement he was made Emeritus Professor (1968) and created the first University Fellow of the ANU. Other positions he held were Chairman of the Editorial Board of the Australian Dictionary of Biography from 1958 to 1965 and inaugural President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities from 1969 to 1971. In 1961 he was appointed to the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In his honour, a library of science resources at the ANU was named after him. He retired in 1965, having been appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1965 New Year's Honours.It's an Honour In these later years he moved south of Canberra, becoming a firm supporter of environmental politics. He disliked American bases on Australian soil, and he was a very prominent but ultimately unsuccessful opponent of the construction of Black Mountain Tower in Canberra. He married Theaden Brocklebank in 1925; she died in 1960. In 1961, he married Marjorie Eyre, who had been his research assistant for the previous 15 years. He died in Canberra on 13 August 1988.

Owned by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, Jackson has manufacturing facilities in the US, Mexico, Indonesia, and China. History =Early years= Grover Jackson obtained part ownership in Charvel's Guitar Repair of Glendora, California in the 1970s with a promise to bolster Charvel's business. Wayne Charvel eventually sold his interest to Grover Jackson on November 10, 1978, which gave Jackson control of the business and the Charvel name. Jackson Guitars originated in 1980 when guitarist Randy Rhoads approached the company with an idea for an individualized guitar. The collaborative design effort between Rhoads, Grover Jackson, Tim Wilson, and Jackson's masterbuilder, Mike Shannon, resulted in the creation of the Concorde, an innovative revamp of the traditional Flying V. These designs were such a departure from Charvel's Stratocaster-based models that Jackson elected to label them under a different brand name. He chose his own last name, and created the first Jackson guitar. Throughout the heavy metal heyday of the 1980s, the Jackson brand was associated with high-quality, American-made, custom instruments, and was used by many popular guitarists of the period. In addition to the original, as they came to be known, Rhoads models, the 1980s spawned distinctively designed Jackson models such as the Soloist, King V, Kelly, and the Dinky, all of which remain icons of the brand. =1990s–present= The 1990s brought changes in musical trends. While still making the high-end American-made products, brands like Jackson began producing inexpensive, Asian-made versions of their staple designs in an effort to make their products more accessible to lower-end buyers. In the Fall of 2002, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation purchased Jackson from IMC, the company which had bought Jackson from Grover Jackson, and U.S. operations were moved to the Fender factory in Corona, California. Present day Fender-era Jackson and Charvel guitars are being produced at the Corona works. Fender still manufactures various lines of lower-end imports, as well. After several years of running a successful company doing sub- contracting work for many well known guitar companies and extensive design consultancy, Grover Jackson is now co-owner of a new guitar brand, GJ2 Guitars, in Orange County, California. His partner in this venture is former Fender Senior Vice President Jon Gold. Design hallmarks Soloist model Randy Rhoads model The distinctive Jackson headstock Ben Varon playing a Jackson Warrior, 2009 From the earliest beginnings until the present day, Jackson Guitars is known for its slender, elegant designs, and feature aggressive motifs that are popular with hard rock and metal musicians. Traditionally, Jackson (and many Charvel) guitars share the typical pointed headstock that first appeared on Randy Rhoads's prototype in 1980. This likely arose from trade dress infringement issues as a result of Charvel's use of Fender Stratocaster shaped headstocks until the early 1980s. Fender's 2002 acquisition of both the Jackson and Charvel brands has enabled the Strat-style headstock to be reintroduced (under license). Another Jackson trademark is the 'shark fin' inlays, which inspired other famous guitar companies such as Ibanez to follow suit with similar designs. =Guitars= ;Jackson guitars currently in production: * Dinky: A bolt-on superstrat with sleeker Stratocaster body, advertised as being a body 7/8 the size of a Stratocaster. * Kelly: A sleeker version of Gibson's popular Explorer, made famous by Marty Friedman of Megadeth, who had a signature model made for him, the KE1. * King V: A symmetric 'V' shape with long pointy wings, based on, but smaller than, the Double Rhoads model originally designed for Robbin Crosby of Ratt, but popularized, through prolific use, by Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, who had a signature model, the KV1. * Monarkh: A single cutaway guitar similar to a Gibson Les Paul.

All Jacksons with \\"Professional\\" on the headstock are made in Japan. * \\"Concept\\": (1993-1994) One of the rarest production series of Jackson imports ever built was the \\"Concept\\" models. They were made for only a few months, beginning at the end of 1993, before quality issues forced Jackson to end its contract with the factory that were making them. The Concept Series was replaced with the Performer Series. * \\"Performer\\" (1994-2001) is a tag that denotes Jackson's low end models, produced during the mid-1990s in Asian factories (initially Japan, later Korea and eventually again in Japan). Even though they continue to make various series of guitars, sometime in the late 1990s, Jackson began dropping the series labels from the headstocks of their imported models.

Like many other rich and ancient body of myth, that of the Georgians has been coloured by the belief systems of the many cultures with which it has come into contact over the millennia. The bedrock upon which it is founded is, by definition, the indigenous mythology of the Kartvelian peoples themselves, whose first emergence from the darkness of prehistory is believed by many scholars to occur with the founding of the Kingdoms of Diauehi, Colchis and Iberia. This said, the consensus of scholarly opinion is that the proto- Kartvelians (possibly to be identified with the Mushki) originated in Ancient Anatolia, where their religious ideas would have come into contact with those of the Hattians, the Hittite empire, the Hurrians, Urartu, and the Armenians. Later influences include the mythologies of the Ancient Greeks,Tuite, Kevin, The Meaning of Dæl, Symbolic and Spatial Associations of the South Caucasian Goddess of Game Animals, Université de Montréal the Vainakh peoples and Iranians - the last-named comprising both the belief systems of the Northern Iranian nomad Scythians and Sarmatians (still preserved to some extent in the mythology of their descendants the Ossetians) and that of the Zoroastrian religion of the Ancient Persian empire, which has left such an enduring legacy among the nations of the Caucasus.Medes and Persians in Transcaucasia: Archaeological Horizons in Northwestern-Iran and Transcaucasia by Stephan Kroll in Continuity of Empire. Assyria, Media, Persia ed. G.B. Lanfranchi, M. Roaf, R. Rollinger (Padova 2003). (See also Iranian religions)Marshall Lang, David, The Georgians, pub. Thames and Hudson 1966 as vol. 51 in the series Ancient Peoples and Places Georgian myths and legends are preserved mainly as popular tales. Many of them have eventually fused with Christian legends after the Christianization of Georgia seventeen centuries ago. The evangelizing of Georgia was, however, far from uniform: while the lowland populations embraced Christianity in the fifth century, the highlanders of the mountain valleys in the Greater Caucasus range were converted only ten centuries later - and in a superficial way at that. It follows from this that accounts of pagan practices in the lowland Christian kingdom are poorly preserved in fragmentary form through brief passages in national chronicles and literary classics. Survivals of pagan beliefs and practices in the Georgian plains are thus, understandably, heavily influenced by Christianity, lacking in mythological unity and essentially folkloric.Charachidzé, Georges, Le système religieux de la Géorgie païenne: analyse structurale d’une civilisation, pub. Paris: Maspero 1968.Charachidzé, Georges : essay : Religion and Myths of the Georgians of the Mountains in Bonnefoy, Yves Mythologies, translated from the original French edition of 1981 (and restructured in more encyclopedic form) by various translators under the direction of Prof.Wendy Doniger, pub. The University of Chicago Press 1991, vol. 1 pps. 308-316 ( in part 3 Celts, Norse, Slavs, Caucasians and their Neighbors ). By contrast: Khevsur/Pshav Creation Myth (N.E. Georgia) In the beginning there existed only Morige Ghmerti and his Sister. She made him unhappy, so he cursed her. The sister became a demon. For every good thing that Morige Ghmerti created, the Demon created an evil thing to mar / oppose it. Woman too was a creation of the Demon, as were the lesser demons ( - see below), while man and the lesser gods were creations of Morige Ghmerti. The lesser gods grew weary in their unceasing fight with the demons and fled to the upper world of Zeskneli, leaving behind them men. The men however lacked the power to resist the demons, so the lesser gods ( - see below) hunted down the demons and drove them underground to the netherworld of Kveskneli. The demons left behind them the women who, like them, were part of the evil creation. Men and women are thus only emanations of, or substitutes for, the gods above and the demons below, respectively. The same principle holds true for all created things: the entities and substances of the universe are divided into two antagonistic series, one wild and demonic, the other social and divine. The only entities or substances that are truly real are those of the upper world of Zeskneli and the lower world of Kveskneli. The middle world inhabited by humans is thus only a place of passage, mediation and meeting and the beings who people it have no essence in themselves, being only emanations of the divine or subterranean worlds, or else their unions. This mountain Georgian creation myth recalls to some extent that of the Zoroastrians, in that it involves the marring of the good creation of a benign creator by an evil spirit (compare Angra Mainyu's attempts to mar the creation of Ahura Mazda - see Bundahishn). It differs radically, however, in its attribution of gender to the principles of good and evil and still more distinctively in its vision of a primordial heavenly harmony of twin creative principles as a brother and sister couple with the disruption of this incestuous union setting in motion creation, with all its attendant woes.  Cosmology  In pre-Christian Georgian mythology, the universe is perceived as a sphere. It comprises three worlds or levels, known as skneli (სკნელი): * Zeskneli (ზესკნელი) - the highest world, and the home of the gods. White is the color of Zeskneli. * The Earth - the middle world, home of mortals. Its center is divided into two regions, anterior (tsina samkaro, წინა სამყარო; or tsinaskneli, წინასკნელი) and posterior (ukana samkaro, უკანა სამყარო; or ukana skneli, უკანასკნელი); - beyond which the lands of Earth are divided by seven or nine mountains (or seas), which a hero can traverse only by first undergoing a spiritual transformation (known as gardatsvaleba (გარდაცვალება) - which is also the word for \\"death\\") and seeking the help of magical animals, such as the Paskunji, the Rashi and others. Red is the colour of this world. * Kveskneli (ქვესკნელი) - the lowest world or underworld, inhabited by the ogres, serpents, and demons. Black is the colour of Kveskneli. These three worlds are connected by a world tree growing on the edge of the universe (or in other accounts a tower, chain, or pillar) - a common theme in the mythologies of many other cultures (compare, for example, Yggdrasil, Égig érő fa and Iroko). Beyond them and the universe is Gareskneli (გარესკნელი), \\"the world of oblivion\\", an endless void of darkness and eternity. There are also two bodies of water and two of fire ( each 'element' having both a subterranean and a celestial form ) with unique influences upon human life. The moon (considered a brother) and the sun (considered a sister) traverse these two realms regularly, but in opposite directions. After Christianization, Zeskneli became associated with Heaven, Kveskneli with Hell, and spiritual travel between these worlds associated with death alone, to the exclusion of older, more shamanic conceptions of the otherworld journey.  Practices of Shamanic Type  The mountain Georgian equivalent of the shaman is the Kadagi, a person (of either gender) who has become permanently possessed by one of the class of minor (i.e. local / specialised) divinities known most often by the name of Hat'i (= 'sign' ), but also by those of Dzhuar (= 'cross') and Saghmto (= 'divinity'). The Hat'i numbered several hundred at the turn of the nineteenth century and the word Hat'i could designate not only a divinity of this class but also its manifestation ( as image, object or real or imaginary animal ) and the place (temple / sanctuary) where it was worshipped. The Kadag would go into trance, both at religious rituals and at events important in individual or collective life, and his or her indwelling Hat'i would foretell the future in a special secret or sacred 'language of the Hat'i '. (See also Spirit possession). A second type of practitioner of shamanic type (exclusively female) was the Mesultane - the word deriving from Georgian suli 'soul'. A Mesultane - usually a woman, although sometimes as young as a girl of nine - was a female who possessed 'the faculty of visiting the beyond in spirit'. At certain times these females would plunge into 'a lethargy broken by mutterings', following which they would awaken and describe their 'journey', communicating the requests of the dead to particular individuals or to the community at large. From their ability to enter these trance states they would derive honours and prestige.Ginzburg, Dr. Carlo Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath, first published in English by Hutchinson Radius 1990 , page 194.  List of supernatural beings from Georgian myth  =Gods= *Adgilis Deda (ადგილის დედა) – A goddess of fertility and livestock revered by the inhabitants of the mountainous areas of northeastern Georgia ( such as Khevsureti ) as the patroness of certain places and of travellers. She is portrayed as a beautiful lady with silver jewellery. She later became associated with the Virgin Mary when the area was converted to Christianity. Her name means \\"Mother of Locality\\". (Compare Genius loci). *Ainina and Danina (აინინა და დანინა) – A pair of goddesses who are mentioned in The Conversion of Kartli and the mediaeval Georgian Chronicles. *Apsat (აფსათი) – A male god of birds and animals in Svan mythology.Virsaladze, Elena Bagratovna, 1976 Gruzinskij okhotnichij Mif i Poeziia (translation : 'Georgian Myth and Poesy of the Hunt') pub. Nauka, Moscow. *Armazi (არმაზი) – Chief of the gods; central figure in the official religion of (Caucasian) Iberia (= Kartli) established by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia (4th century BC). According to the Life of Saint Nino an immense statue of Armazi – along with images of other deities and the temple that housed them – was destroyed by a storm of giant hailstones raised by the prayers of Saint Nino. Armazi is also the name of an ancient fortress near Mtskheta that dates from the same period. Various complementary strands of research suggest that the origins of this deity lie in a syncretism between conceptions of the Zoroastrian supreme being Ahura Mazda () and a native Georgian supreme lunar deity (see also Tetri Giorgi below) – a regional variant of the Hittite moon god Arma.Gvelesiani, Mariam. To Interrelations of Georgian Armazi, Armenian Aramazd and Iranian Ahuramazda.New Alliance Foundation. *Barbale (ბარბალე) – The goddess of cattle and poultry fertility, the sun, women's fertility, and healing. Worshippers honour her in the Barbalesadmi festival with solar symbols, which occurs at the winter solstice. Her name is similar to the Sumerian and Akkadian epithet \\"bibbiru\\", which means \\"shining, splendour\\". *Batonebi (ბატონები) – Spirits of disease. Their name means \\"the masters\\". In modern use \\"Batonebi\\" is used as a term to refer to a small set of infectious diseases, that are often prominent among children (measles, chickenpox and few others) If anyone is infected by the Batonebi, following one tradition their family will prepare special food and candies, and place presents under trees to appease the Batonebi (Traditions vary, but general motif is for whole family to appease the sick child). *Beri-Bera (ბერი ბერა) – An agricultural god of fertility, harvests, and animals who is worshipped in eastern Georgia. His festival is held at the end of the year. *Bochi (ბოჩი) – Thought to be the patron saint of cattle. The first written documentation of this deity comes from Euthymius of Athos. According to historian Ivane Javakhishvili, the name \\"Bochi\\" is related to words for \\"male goat.\\" *Dali (დალი), Svanetian 'Dæl' – the goddess of the hunt. She was believed to have extraordinary beauty, with long golden hair and radiant white skin. She dwells high up in the mountains where she watches over and protects wild animals. She sometimes shares animals with hunters, as long as they respect her rules by not hunting more than their needed amounts or taking aim at animals that are her manifestations. In some myths, she will enter into a sexual relationship with a hunter, while warning him not to reveal their liaison upon pain of death by petrifaction (compare Medusa) along with his hounds – the fate also of those who break promises they have made her. Ochokochi (ოჭოკოჩი) is so infatuated with her, that he is forever attempting to have sex with her, but the mortal hunters who visit her forests often thwart his attempts to catch her. She is the mother of the hero Amiran. In Samegrelo, she is named as \\"Tkashi-Mapa\\", the Queen of the Forest.Chaudhri, Anna, The Caucasian Hunting Divinity, Male and Female: Traces of the Hunting- Goddess in Ossetic Folklore, essay constituting Chapter 13 of The Concept of the Goddess, eds. Sandra Billington and Miranda Green, pub. Routledge 1996 , pps. 166-177. *Gatsi and Gaim (გაცი და გაიმი) – Gods in the official Iberian pantheon according to the medieval annals. *Ghmerti (ღმერთი) – The supreme divinity and the head of the pantheon of gods. He is the all-powerful Lord of the Universe and its Creator. He lives in the ninth sky, where he rules from a golden throne. His children include the moon (as his son), the sun (as his daughter), and the Ghvtis Shvilni who protect people against evil. He is also addressed as Morige Ghmerti (მორიგე ღმერთი, \\"God the Director\\") and Dambadebeli (დამბადებელი, \\"The Creator\\"). His name is later used to refer to God the Father in Christian belief. *Kamar (ყამარი) The daughter of the god of the sky. She is a symbol of divine fire. Her beautiful appearance caused Amiran to abduct her from heaven. *Lamaria, also Lamara (ლამარია) – goddess of fertility, cattle, and the hearth *Mamber (მამბერი) – The lord of wolves ( compare Ossetian Tutyr – see below under heading 'Tevdore' ), who was worshiped in Svaneti and other mountainous regions. *Michpa (მიჭპა) – The patron god of cattle and other domestic animals who was worshiped in Svaneti during winter. *Mindort-batoni (მინდორთ ბატონი) – The god of valleys, fields, and wild flowers. Humans have to ask his permission before exploring or attempting to cultivate the fruitful lands that make up his domain. His daughter, Mindort-brdzanebeli, is the beautiful goddess of flowers. *Mindort- brdzanebeli (მინდორთ ბრძანებელი) – The goddess of flowers. She is the daughter of the god Mindort-batoni. She flutters over plants, feeding on their pollen. *Ochopintre (ოჩოპინტრე) – A spirit of the forest and protector of wild animals. The first part of his name (ocho, ოჭო) is connected to the ancient pagan god Bochi, the second part (pintre, პინტრე) to the Greek god Pan. Born with the legs and horns of a goat, he assists the goddess Dali in herding the animals. Hunters usually made sacrifice in his name since no one could hunt the animals without his help. The fate of a person entering his forest was believed to be fully in his hands. *Samdzimari (სამძიმარი) - demon-born goddess of fertility and oracles, seducer of men. *Tamar (თამარი) – Goddess who enslaved the Morning Star and controlled the weather patterns; was called \\"eye of the earth\\" and rode a serpent. *Tetri Giorgi (თეთრი გიორგი, \\"White George\\"), form of Saint George venerated in Kakheti, variously identified as a reflex of the ancient lunar god, and as a reflex of the ancient storm/weather god (Kopala).Tuite (2004) *Tevdore (თევდორე) – God of agriculture and horses. After Christianization, he became associated with St. Theodore. In feudal times the special festival of Tedoroba was organised to honor him and ensure a bountiful harvest. ( Compare Ossetian deity Tutyr, Lord of the Wolves – likewise based on St. Theodore ). *Tskarishdida (წკარიშდიდა) – A mermaid-like goddess of rivers, lakes and fish, in Mingrelian folklore. She uses magic powers against humans. *Zaden (ზადენი) – God of fertility in the official pantheon established by Pharnavaz I. He was believed to be as powerful as Armazi. He was added into the official pantheon by Parnajom in the second century BC, and had a statue of him erected at a fortress near Mt. Zedazeni, near Mtskheta. His statue was said to have been destroyed with the statues of other gods through the prayers of St. Nino. The worship of him declined after Christianization. =Demigods, heroes, and notable people= *Amiran (ამირანი) – Mythic hero and titan, son of Dali. Equivalent of the Greek Prometheus. *Iakhsar (იახსარი) – A mythic hero who aided Kopala in his adventures to slay demons and monsters, and was deified and venerated as a popular deity. *Ghvtis Shvilni (ღვთის შვილნი, Children of God or Children of Gmerti) – A group of demigods who protected humans, assured good crops and milk yields, fought against devis and kudiani witches. Amiran, Giorgi, Iakhsar, and Kopala were among them, and they fought alongside Iakhsar and Kopala to drive out the devis from the land, and to help Giorgi to raid the impregnable fortress of the kajis to plunder their treasures, cattle, and women. *Kopala (კოპალა) – A mythic hero, mighty warrior, and demon-killer – also a lightning god.Tuite, Kevin (2000). \\"Lightning, sacrifice and possession in the traditional religions of the Caucasus\\". He and Iakhsar lead a campaign to drive underground the devis who are persecuting humans in the middle realm. His weapons include a mace and an iron bow made for him by the blacksmith god Pirkusha (პირქუშა) (with whom compare Ossetian divine smith Kurdalægon and Circassian Tlepsh).Colarusso, John, Nart Sagas from the Caucasus, pub. Princeton University Press 2002 . Tales 16, 17, 20 and 21. He alone has the power to defeat the most stubborn demons, believed to seize a person's soul and cause madness, and, by this means, he cures those afflicted by insanity. Revered by the inhabitants of the mountainous areas of Khevsureti and Pshavi. (Compare Indra, Fereydun, The Dagda and Thor). *Kviria (კვირია) – A hero and a son of the gods who served as a mediator between Ghmerti and humanity. He is invoked as the protector of human society and an instrument of divine justice. In some regions of Georgia, he was also believed to be a deity of fertility and the harvest, while in the mountains of western Georgia he was worshiped as the supreme deity. The festival of Kviratskholovba (კვირაცხოვლობა) was celebrated to honour him, as also (Marshall Lang surmises) were the erotic and orgiastic cults and festivals, such as the Berikoba and Murqvamoba, celebrated regularly until recent times among the Pshavs, Khevsurs, Svans and other mountain Georgian tribes. The curious ithyphallic figurines discovered by G.D. Filimonov at the settlement of Kazbek on the Georgian Military Highway may also (Marshall Lang further surmises) relate to erotic aspects of the cult of Kviria. Such figurines have been the subject of much debate among archaeologists and anthropologists and examples continue to come to light in various parts of Georgia, as far east as central Kakhetia, in association with finds of bronze daggers of specific 'Kakhetian type', dating to between the thirteenth and eighth centuries B.C.E. Some of these ithyphallic figurines had been designed to be hung from drinking horns. *Natsiliani (ნაწილიანი) – Humans who received magic gifts or divine signs () from the gods. Their signs are usually located on their shoulder-blades and glow with magic light, empowering their bearers. These signs must be kept hidden, as their bearers will lose their powers if they reveal them. Certain signs can only be given by their respective gods. =Spirits, creatures, and other beings= \\"Tarielis shebma devebtan\\". A miniature by Mamuka Tavakalashvili from the manuscript of Shota Rustaveli's \\"Knight in the Panther's Skin\\". H599. 199r. National Center of Manuscripts, Tbilisi, Georgia *Ali (ალი) – A type of Lilith-like demon that afflicts pregnant women, the elderly, and infants who happen to stumble into remote woods, caves, and ruins. Alis can be male or female (the females being known as alkali); male alis generally appear monstrous, while female alis can shift between tempting beauty and hag-like ugliness. Their name may be related to the word for \\"flame\\" (ალი). This supernatural being occurs not only in the folklore of the Caucasus, but also in the folk beliefs of Iran, Central Asia and Mongolia and conceptions of its appearance may derive from folk memories of relict hominins (see also Almas (cryptozoology)). *Devi (დევი) – Many- headed ogres whose heads can regenerate if any of them are cut off (compare Lernaean Hydra). These malevolent giants live in the underworld or in remote mountains, where they hoard treasure troves and keep their captives. In Georgian mythology, they live in a family, consisting usually of nine brothers. Bakbak-Devi (ბაყბაყ-დევი) was the strongest and the most powerful of the devis. To defeat them, heroes would outwit them by means of various tricks and games. Their name (a borrowing into the Kartvelian (language family) Georgian language from Indo-European) is related to that of the daevas of Zoroastrian and Persian mythology, derived in turn from Proto-Indo-European *deiu̯ó 'god'. *Dobilni (translation: 'the ones who became sisters'; დობილნი) – disease-spreading spirits, appearing usually in the form of women, children or animals. Dobilni towers () were built in Khevsurian shrines to keep them at bay. Some Dobilni are benevolent, such as Princess Samdzimar (სამძიმარი) of Khevsureti legend, who is invoked for an easy childbirth, the birth of healthy children, and women's health in general. Benevolent Dobilni were also invoked at certain shrines in order to bless cattle and also for the protection of travellers. *Gveleshapi (გველეშაპი, in ancient sources გველ-ვეშაპი - Snake- whale) – Evil serpent that ruled and lived in lakes, rivers, and water sources (compare Nāga). In folklore, they were associated with water-related disasters, and heroes fought against them. (See also Serpent (symbolism). *Kaji (ქაჯი) – A race of spirits who are often portrayed as magic-wielding, demonic metal-workers ( compare Sons of Ivaldi ). They lived in Kajeti (ქაჯეთი), and had magic powers that they used against humans. Land kajis were malevolent, while river and lake kajis were friendly to humans. Female kajis were beautiful, and they either seduced heroes or helped them in their quests.Testen, David. 1989. The kingdom of the Kajes in The Non-Slavic Languages of the USSR: Linguistic Studies ed. by H. Aronson, pps. 158-175. Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society. They appear prominently in Shota Rustaveli's Vepkhistkaosani (ვეფხისტყაოსანი), in which the Kajis abduct Princess Nestan-Darejan and fight the heroes at Kajeti fortress, although Rustaveli euhemerises them, portraying them, not as a race of supernatural beings, but a tribe of human wizards (albeit wizards of awe-inspiring power).The Knight in Panther Skin, a free translation into prose from the Georgian verse of Shota Rustaveli by Katharine Vivian, pub. The Folio Society London 1977, page 166. The Kajis also feature in The Snake-eater by another celebrated Georgian poet, Vazha-Pshavela, in which they appear as the preparers of a stew of snake-meat that confers occult wisdom on the hero, MindiaVaja Pshavela: 3 Poems, translated into English by David Rayfield, pub. Borbalo Group, Georgia 2002. (compare The White Snake). Their name is related to the Armenian storm and wind spirits, the kaj (Armenian: քաջ, k'aǰ; plural: քաջք k'aǰk'). *Kudiani (კუდიანი) – A type of hideous hunchbacked witch, having large teeth and a tail, from the latter of which her name is derived (kudi, კუდი, \\"tail\\"). Kudianis can disguise themselves as humans in order to bewitch them. The leader of the kudianis, Rokap (როკაპი), often summons them to a special mountain (compare Brocken, Łysa Góra, Lysa Hora (Kiev) and Lysa Hora (folklore)) where they hold a festival similar to the European Walpurgis Night. *Matsil (მაცილი) – Evil spirits from the underworld that plague travelers and hunters. Folk tales refer to Kopala's efforts to defeat them. *Ocho-Kochi (ოჩოკოჩი) – A forest being in Mingrelian folklore who comes into conflict with hunters. Instead of hair on his chest, he has a protuberance in the form of a pointed bone or a stone axe, which he uses to kill passersby by embracing them. He often chases Tkashi-Mapa, the beautiful Queen of the Forest, out of lust, but his uncouth advances are just as often thwarted by mortal hunters (with the worthiest of whom she prefers, on occasion, to mate). *Paskunji (ფასკუნჯი) – A phoenix-like being who helps heroes and humans. He lives in the underworld, and fights the serpents there. Heroes summoned him by burning one of his feathers, and he could transport them to other places and heal wounds and illnesses. In certain other myths, by contrast, paskunjis are portrayed as being hostile to humans and to have persecuted them. *Q'ursha (ყურშა) – A legendary hunting dog associated with various mythological figures including Dali and Amirani. *Rashi (რაში) – A magical winged horse (compare Pegasus, Buraq, Tulpar, Chollima and Rakhsh). There are three types of rashis: land rashis are well disposed to heroes and humans and could perceive the future; sea rashis are more hostile, but can take humans to the bottom of the sea, while their milk was believed to cure many illnesses; and heavenly rashis have wings and can breathe fire, and are difficult to subdue yet loyal to their owners. Kourkik Challaly, a similar magical, fiery, winged horse plays a large part (as the wise and faithful steed of successive generations of heroes) in the Armenian epic poem Daredevils of Sassoun.

It was led by the Duke of York, who was the brother of Charles II and later took the throne as James II. It shipped more African slaves to the Americas than any other institution in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. It was established after Charles II gained the English throne in the Restoration of 1660. While its original purpose was to exploit the gold fields up the Gambia River, which were identified by Prince Rupert during the Interregnum, it soon developed and led a brutal and sustained slave trade. It also extracted other commodities, mainly from the Gold Coast. After becoming insolvent in 1708, it survived in a state of much reduced activity until 1752 when its assets were transferred to the new African Company of Merchants, which lasted until 1821. History =Background= In the 17th century the settlements on the west coast of Africa, though they had an important trade of their own in gold and ivory, existed chiefly for the supply of slaves to the West Indies and America. On the west coast the Europeans lived in fortified factories (trading posts) but had no sovereignty over the land or its natives. The coastal tribes acted as intermediaries between them and the slave-hunters of the interior. There was little incentive for white men to explore up the rivers, and few of them did so. The atmosphere might have been one of quiet routine had there not been acute rivalries between the European powers; especially the Dutch, who made use of native allies against their rivals. Before the Restoration the Dutch had been the main suppliers of slaves to the English West Indian plantations, but it was part of the policy of the English Navigation Acts to oust them from this lucrative trade. =Foundation and early years= guinea showing the Royal African Company's symbol, an elephant and castle, under the bust of James II Originally known as the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa, by its charter issued in 1660 it was granted a monopoly over English trade along the west coast of Africa, with the principal objective being the search for gold. In 1663 a new charter was obtained which also mentioned the trade in slaves. This was the third English African Company, but it made a fresh start in the slave trade and there was only one factory of importance for it to take over from the East India Company, which had leased it as a calling-place on the sea-route round the Cape. This was Cormantin, a few miles east of the Dutch station of Caso Corso or Cape Coast Castle. In 1663, as a prelude to the Dutch war, Captain Holmes's expedition captured or destroyed all the Dutch settlements on the coast, and in 1664 Fort James was founded on an island about twenty miles up the Gambia river, as a new centre for English trade and power. This, however, was only the beginning of a series of captures and recaptures. In the same year de Ruyter won back all the Dutch forts except Cape Coast Castle and also took Cormantin. The treaty of Breda confirmed Cape Coast Castle to the English. also published as Forts served as staging and trading stations, and the Company was responsible for seizing any English ships that attempted to operate in violation of its monopoly (known as interlopers). In the \\"prize court\\", the King received half of the proceeds and the Company half from the seizure of these interlopers., originally published in London by Longmans, Green in 1957. The Company fell heavily into debt in 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. For several years after that, the Company maintained some desultory trade, including licensing single-trip private traders, but its biggest effort was the creation in 1668 of the Gambia Adventurers.Sometimes known as The Gambian Merchants' Company. This new company was separately subscribed and granted a ten-year licence for African trade north of the Bight of Benin with effect from 1 January 1669. At the end of 1678, the licence to the Gambia Adventurers expired and its Gambian trade was merged into the Company. The African Company was ruined by its losses and surrendered its charter in 1672, to be followed by the still more ambitious Royal African Company of England. Its new charter was broader than the old one and included the right to set up forts and factories, maintain troops, and exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in gold, silver and African slaves.Kitson, Frank. (1999) Prince Rupert: Admiral and General-at- Sea. London: Constable, p. 238. Until 1687 the Company was very prosperous. It set up six forts on the Gold Coast, and another post at Ouidah, farther east on the Slave Coast, which became its principal centre for trade. Cape Coast Castle was strengthened and rose to be second in importance only to the Dutch factory at Elmina. Anglo-Dutch rivalry was, however, henceforward unimportant in the region and the Dutch were not strong enough to take aggressive measures here in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. =Slave trade= In the 1680s the Company was transporting about 5,000 enslaved people a year to markets primarily in the Caribbean across the Atlantic. Many were branded with the letters \\"DoY\\", for its Governor, the Duke of York, who succeeded his brother on the throne in 1685, becoming King James II. Other slaves were branded with the company's initials, RAC, on their chests.Micklethwait, John, and Adrian Wooldridge. The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea. New York: Modern Library, 2003. . Historian William Pettigrew has stated that this company “shipped more enslaved African women, men and children to the Americas than any other single institution during the entire period of the transatlantic slave trade,” and that investors in the company were fully aware of its activities and intended to profit from this exploitation. Between 1662 and 1731, the Company transported approximately 212,000 slaves, of whom 44,000 died en route. By that time, they also transported slaves to English colonies in North America. =Later activities and insolvency= From 1694 to 1700, the Company was a major participant in the Komenda Wars in the port city Komenda in the Eguafo Kingdom in modern-day Ghana. The Company allied with a merchant prince named John Cabess and various neighbouring African kingdoms to depose the king of Eguafo and establish a permanent fort and factory in Komenda. The English took two French forts and lost them again, after which the French destroyed Fort James. The place appears to have been soon regained and in the War of Spanish Succession to have been twice retaken by the French. In the treaty of Utrecht it remained English. The French wars caused considerable losses to the Company. In 1689, the Company acknowledged that it had lost its monopoly with the end of royal power in the Glorious Revolution, and it ceased issuing letters of marque. Edward Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to William III at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime's favour. To maintain the Company and its infrastructure and end its monopoly, parliament passed the Trade with Africa Act 1697 (9 Will. 3 c. 26). Among other provisions, the Act opened the African trade to all English merchants who paid a ten per cent levy to the Company on all goods exported from Africa.P. E. H. Hair & Robin Law, 'The English in West Africa to 1700', in The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume 1, The Origins of Empire: British Overseas Enterprise to the close of the Seventeenth Century, ed. Nicholas Canny (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 259 The Company was unable to withstand competition on the terms imposed by the Act and in 1708 became insolvent, surviving until 1750 in a state of much reduced activity. The Company continued purchasing and transporting slaves until 1731, when it abandoned slaving in favour of ivory and gold dust. From 1668 to 1722, the Royal African Company provided gold to the English Mint. Coins made with such gold are designed with an elephant below the bust of the king and/or queen. This gold also gave the coinage its name, the guinea. Members and officials At its incorporation, the constitution of the company specified a Governor, Sub Governor, Deputy Governor and 24 Assistants. The Assistants (also called Members of the Court of Assistants) can be considered equivalent to a modern day board of directors. * James Stuart, Duke of York, the future King James II – Governor of the Company from 1660 to 1688; and its largest shareholder *Edward Colston (1636–1721), merchant, philanthropist, and Member of Parliament, was a shareholder in the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692; from 1689 to 1690 he was its Deputy Governor, a senior executive position, the basis on which he is described as a slave trader.Statue of Edward Colston A Grade II Listed Building in Bristol, listing at britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, accessed 10 June 2020 *Charles Hayes (1678–1760), mathematician and chronologer, was sub-governor of the Royal African Company in 1752, when it was dissolved.

The names of his parents were José María Salcedo and Luisa Ramírez y Marichal. Leaving Spain, the family moved to Cuba when Salcedo was a year old before settling in the Cibao valley. He grew up near the border of Haiti where he managed large tracts of land, herds of livestock, and a rich timber business in the towns of Hatillo Palma, Estero Balsa, and Botoncillo in the northwest. Salcedo led a civil war which aimed at the restoration of the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Restoration War began on August 16, 1863, and by September 14, 1863 a Provisional Government was established, over which the general presided. After he became the 1st head of state of the Dominican Republic, the general was opposed by the Nationalist movement, who viewed his policies as favoring those supporting the annexation of the country.

The party never won any seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. It was affiliated with the Social Credit Party of Canada and espoused social credit theories of monetary reform. 1940s and 1950s Social Credit appears to have been inactive in Ontario until 1945 when eight candidates stood in the province for the federal party in the 1945 federal election. The Ontario Social Credit Party ran three candidates in the 1945 provincial election. In 1946, the Ontario Social Credit movement split as a result of Ernest Manning's growing hostility to Douglasites and anti-Semites in the movement. The official Ontario Social Credit League was headed by John J. Fitzgerald and William Ovens. Ron Gostick, a far right propagandist, established the Union of Electors as a rival organization inspired by the more radical Quebec social credit organization, Union des electeurs led by Louis Even. Like Even's group, the Union rejected the party system and ran not as a partisan political party but as a citizen's organization compelling their elected representatives to represent the will of the people. Like the Quebec-based Union, it also believed in a more orthodox application of social credit economic theory and was more openly anti-Semitic. In October 1947, the Ontario Social Credit League held an emergency convention which repudiated Gostick and the Union for infringing the League's rights.Social Discredit: Anti-Semitism, Social Credit and the Jewish Response by Janine Stingel page 154-155. In the 1948 provincial election the official Social Credit League ran no candidates but the Union of Electors ran fifteen candidates. The Ontario Union of Electors was accused by the Toronto Labour Council of \\"disseminating racial hatred in its crudest form.\\"\\"Toronto Civic Jobs Closed To Some Races, TLC Told\\", Toronto Daily Star, September 16, 1949 Both parties then went dormant running no candidates in the 1951 or 1955 provincial elections, although the federal party continued to run candidates in Ontario during federal elections throughout the 1950s. In the 1959 provincial election the Social Credit party ran five candidates under the leadership of Edgar Shipley Birrell.

The group was formed when the official party refused to actively campaign in the 1963 provincial election.Globe and Mail, 23 September 1963, p.9. Audy had been the federal Social Credit Party's candidate in Spadina riding in the previous election. Carmichael, 45, a five-time federal Socred candidate, had been the focus of controversy earlier that year when he was a federal Social Credit candidate in St. Paul's. He asserted at a public meeting that there was a Jewish conspiracy in which the Rothschilds were plotting to acquire all of Canada's mines through non-Jewish third party operatives, and that the family was part of an international Jewish conspiracy to take over all of Canada's businesses.\\"Jews Have Designs on Mines: Carmichael\\", Globe and Mail, March 6, 1963http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb039/is_2_31/ai_n28756491/pg_12/ Carmichael was cautioned by the Social Credit Party of Ontario that he was \\"skating on thin ice\\" and would not be permitted to stand as a candidate again.

Many of my customers are Jewish.\\" At a subsequent meeting, he said that his comments were \\"indiscreet\\", that had he known he was going to be quoted he would have \\"cloaked them in nice phrases\\", and accused the Jews of persecuting him for his remarks, blaming a reporter with a Jewish-sounding name for quoting him.\\"Truth and Indiscretion\\", Globe and Mail, March 23, 1963 In the same meeting Carmichael declared that Adolf Hitler's economic system was \\"a very good and sound system of money\\" and that the Nazis \\"had it all figured out so that there was no unemployment.\\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb039/is_2_31/ai_n28756491/pg_13/?tag=content;col1 Carmichael's Social Credit membership was not renewed prior to his formation of Social Credit Action. Social Credit Action supported Réal Caouette when he took his Ralliement des creditistes out of the Social Credit Party of Canada in September 1963, while the official party remained loyal to federal party leader Robert N. Thompson. Audy accused the Ontario Social Credit Association of being dominated by Protestant clergyman who were prejudiced against Caouette because he was a Catholic.\\"Ontario Socreds Back Thompson\\", Globe and Mail, October 12, 1963 Richard Day, a spokesperson for the official Social Credit League of Ontario derided the views of Social Credit Action as being \\"anti-Semitic, economic trash and hypocritical\\".\\"Nominations split Social Crediters\\", Globe and Mail, August 30, 1963 Social Credit Action nominated six candidates in ridings in Toronto in the 1963 provincial election, while the official party nominated only three candidates in rural ridings. The Social Credit Action candidates included Carmichael, Audy, Hartman and fascist John Ross Taylor. However, when it was reported that \\"the former leader of the Canadian Union of Fascists was running\\", the splinter group disassociated itself from Taylor on the eve of the election and he instead ran as a \\"Natural Order of Social Credit Organization\\" candidate.\\"Now Socred Splinter Party is Splintered\\", Toronto Daily Star, September 25, 1963 Audy was announced by Caouette as his Ontario lieutenant but did not end up running in the 1965 federal election.

Fascist takeover and split In the early 1970s the radical Edmund Burke Society (EBS) infiltrated the party electing Paul Fromm as the party's president and other EBSers to the executive. In the 1971 provincial election three of five Social Credit candidates running in the election were avowed \\"Burkers\\". By 1972, the party had been taken over by the EBS which now called itself the Western Guard. As a result, the party was put under trusteeship at the instigation of the federal party which declared membership in the Western Guard to be \\"incompatible\\" with membership in Social Credit.\\"Ontario Socreds may have violated bylaws\\", Globe and Mail, April 5, 1972Security Intelligence Review Committee, The Heritage Front Affair: Report to the Solicitor General of Canada, section 7.1, December 9, 1994.The League for Human Rights of B'nai Brith Canada, The Heritage Front: Into the mainstream, 1994 The federal Social Credit Party disavowed the Social Credit Association of Ontario led by John Ross Taylor of the Western Guard and instead recognized the \\"Ontario Social Credit League\\", established in 1973 under the leadership of Bruce Arnold.\\"Fallout shelters urged\\", Toronto Star, June 13, 1974 In the 1975 Ontario election the \\"Ontario Social Credit League\\", led by Alcide Hamelin, fielded 12 candidates, mostly in rural areas, but they were not officially recognized as such as the party did not run enough candidates or otherwise qualify for official party status under the newly passed Election Finances Reform Act, 1975.725 seats in legislature: Record 454 candidates nominated for 125 Ontario seats The Globe and Mail (1936-Current); Sep 5, 1975; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Globe and Mail pg. 40Elected: PCs, 51; NDP, 38; Lib, 36: AFTER 30 YEARS, TORY MINORITY Lewis will head official Opposition Williamson, Robert.

In the 1974 federal election, the Ontario Social Credit Association endorsed Martin Weiche as a candidate in Trinity co-endorsed by the Western Guard though because the party was not officially registered with Elections Canada their federal candidates were officially listed as independents. Neither Social Credit party ran candidates in the 1977 provincial election though several candidates ran as \\"Independent Social Credit\\". Also in 1977, Western Guard leader Don Andrews was convicted of plotting to bomb the Israeli basketball team and was forced to sever his ties with the Western Guard freeing the way for John Ross Taylor to become the group's leader. He folded his Social Credit Association and became leader of the renamed Western Guard Party. Later years Reg Gervais was leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party in 1981 and announced prior to the March 1981 provincial election that he planned to run in Nickel Belt, but did not follow through. John Turmel claimed to be the interim leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party during the campaign running 5 candidates in the Ottawa area. In October 1981, the Ontario Social Credit Party conducted a leadership convention. The eleven delegates, who represented about 100 party members throughout the province, elected former Toronto mayoral candidate Anne C. McBride as their new leader in a vote of 7 to 1 with 3 spoiled ballots. McBride was a Nova Scotia-born ordained minister in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal Christian denomination. She vowed to run the party \\"on Christian principles\\". At various times, McBride ran for mayor of Toronto, tried to form her own United Party of Canada in the early 1980s, and sought the leadership of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada at the 1982 Social Credit leadership convention. However, under her leadership, the party failed to run candidates for the Ontario legislature in any subsequent election and eventually became inactive. By the 1985 provincial election the party was defunct though Turmel still claimed to be a \\"Social Credit\\" candidate in at least one provincial by-election in the late 1980s. Turmel attempted to create a new Social Credit Party of Ontario in the mid-1980s but was unable to meet the criteria in place by that time for the registration of new political parties which included filing a petition signed by 10,000 qualified voters.

The product consists of a clear plastic tube filled with a fruit-flavored liquid. Some varieties claim to contain 100% fruit juice. Otter Pops are a frozen treat, but stores generally sell them at room temperature and the consumer puts them in the freezer. Background National Pax introduced Otter Pops in 1970, in competition with Jel Sert's similar product, Fla-Vor- Ice. In 1996, Jel Sert acquired the rights to Otter Pops as well. During the 2000s, Jel Sert modified the Otter Pops recipe to add more fruit juice. The company's manufacturing facilities are in West Chicago, Illinois.

IL 53 runs from Main Street west of historic U.S. Route 66 (US 66) in Gardner to IL 83 in Long Grove, a distance of . It mainly cuts through the western suburbs of Chicago, passes through Bolingbrook, Romeoville, Crest Hill and Joliet, merging into I-55 at Gardner.  Route description  IL 53 is one of the few state highways routed along expressways in the state. Before it becomes an expressway, IL 53 starts out in Long Grove going southwest towards Palatine. South of Lake-Cook Road, IL 53 follows Hicks Road, Rand Road (concurrent with U.S. 12) and Dundee Road (concurrent with Illinois 68) through Palatine's northeast side before it joins an expressway that starts un-numbered (technically a spur of 53), one mile (1.6 km) north at Lake-Cook Rd as a bypass of northeast Palatine. The northeast Palatine stretch goes through the Rand and Dundee intersection, one of the country's deadliest intersections in traffic accidents. It forms the other half of the Interstate 290/IL 53 combination in Schaumburg before being routed west onto Biesterfield Road and back south onto Rohlwing Road. Until its first junction with I-55 by Bolingbrook, it remains a mostly 2 to 4 lane road, largely replaced by the I-290 and I-355 combo. In the suburb of Lombard, IL 53 is called Columbine Avenue. IL 53 and IL 7 southbound South of the first junction with I-55, IL 53 follows the path of historic Route 66 in Illinois and parallels Interstate 55, entering downtown Joliet, which is about four miles (6 km) east of I-55. IL 53 also passes directly in front of Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois. From Joliet it follows the original Route 66 alignment to the south. It remains a four-lane divided highway for about , passing through Elwood and the former Joliet Arsenal, part of which is now the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery and Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. Route 53 narrows to two lanes just outside Wilmington and crosses the Kankakee River in downtown Wilmington. It then continues southwest through Braidwood and Braceville on its way to Gardner, where it loops around the southern part of town before ending at Main Street.  History  SBI Route 53 ran from Romeoville to Long Grove on Rohlwing Road and Hicks Road from 1924 to 1963. From 1963 through 1970, it was routed onto a new freeway from Addison to Rolling Meadows and cosigned with I-90 until that was changed to I-290. In 1967 IL 53 was extended to Gardner, and in 1995 IL 129 was routed onto IL 53 south of Braidwood. This lasted a year until IL 129 was dropped entirely south of Braidwood. Near the northern end, the freeway was extended from Dundee Road to Lake–Cook Road in 1989. In 1990, with the construction of I-355, IL 53 was moved off the I-290/I-355 combination south of Biesterfield Road and back onto its original alignment. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) proposed in 1999 to widen IL 53 south of US 20 (Lake Street) and generally north of I-88 to a five-lane section. Opposition from a citizen group called NIFTI (Neighbors Influencing Fifty-Three improvement) began to lobby for a smaller expansion plan to three lanes. The road south of Lake Street runs through predominantly residential areas and light industry. The term context sensitive design and solutions was introduced to the state of Illinois through the efforts of this group. For over 40 years, IL 53 had been at the center of a major dispute regarding a northern extension of its freeway segment into Lake County. The studied corridor ran from the current terminus of the freeway at Lake–Cook Road north to a planned bypass for IL 120 near Grayslake. The combined IL 53/IL 120 extension would have formed a large T-shape in the center of Lake County, with the IL 120 bypass carrying through traffic from US 12 to the Tri-State Tollway around Gurnee. The extension was opposed by several organizations, notably the Illinois chapter of the Sierra Club, and many residents of Long Grove, which lies in the path of the highway. The Sierra Club opposed the roadway extension because it would have been routed through wetlands and the group had concerns about suburban sprawl and increased pollution. Due to funding constraints with IDOT, the Illinois General Assembly authorized the Illinois Tollway to plan and construct the IL 53 extension in 1993, and was studied on and off for 25 years. In 2019, the latest study was suspended, effectively cancelling the project.

Colston followed his father in the family business becoming a sea merchant, initially trading in wine, fruits and textiles, mainly in Spain, Portugal and other European ports. By 1680, he became involved in the slave trade as a member of the Royal African Company, which held a monopoly on the English trade in African slaves. He was deputy governor of the company in 1689–90. Colston's name was widely commemorated in Bristol landmarks, and a statue of him was erected in 1895. With growing awareness in the late 20th century of his involvement in Britain's slave trade, there were protests and petitions for name changes, culminating in June 2020, when the statue was toppled and pushed into Bristol Harbour during protests in support of Black Lives Matter. Colston Hall, which was named after him, was renamed Bristol Beacon. Early life Colston was born on 2 November 1636 in Temple Street, Bristol, and baptised in the Temple Church, Bristol. His parents were William Colston (1608–1681), a prosperous Royalist merchant who was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1643, and his wife Sarah Batten (d.1701), daughter of Edward Batten; he was the eldest of at least 11 and possibly as many as 15 children. The Colston family had lived in the city since the late 13th century. Colston was brought up in Bristol until the time of the English Civil War, when he probably lived for a while on his father's estate in Winterbourne, just north of the city. The family then moved to London. Career In 1654 Colston was apprenticed to the Mercers Company for eight years, and in 1673 he was enrolled into it. By 1672 he had become a merchant in London. Like his father Colston exported in textiles from London while importing oils, wine and sherry from Spain and Portugal. He also traded silk with Virginia and was a regular trader of Newfoundland cod to Naples. He had built up a successful business trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa. In 1680, Colston became a member of the Royal African Company, which had held the monopoly in England on trading along the west coast of Africa in gold, silver, ivory and slaves from 1662. Colston was deputy governor of the company from 1689 to 1690. His association with the company ended in 1692. This company had been set up by King Charles II and his brother the Duke of York (later King James II), who was the governor of the company, together with City of London merchants, and it had many notable investors, including philosopher and physician John Locke (who later changed his stance on the slave trade) and the diarist Samuel Pepys. During Colston's involvement with the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692 it is estimated that the company transported over 84,000 African men, women and children to the Caribbean and the rest of the Americas, of whom as many as 19,000 may have died on the journey. The slaves were sold for labour on tobacco, and, increasingly, sugar plantations, whose planters considered Africans would be more suited to the conditions than British workers, as the climate resembled the climate of their homeland in West Africa. Enslaved Africans were much less expensive to maintain than indentured servants or paid wage labourers from Britain. Colston's parents had resettled in Bristol. In 1682 he made a loan to the Bristol Corporation and the following year, became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers. Although a Tory High Churchman and often in conflict with the Whig corporation of Bristol, Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to William III at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime's favour for the African Co. The value of Colston's shares increased and being without heirs he began to donate large sums to charities. He withdrew from the African Co. in 1692, but continued trading in slaves privately. He retired in 1708. Colston was MP for Bristol (1710-13). Death Cromwell House, Mortlake, where Colston died in 1721 Colston died on 11 October 1721, aged 84, at his home, (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake, south west London. His will stated that he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored. Edward Colston Will, National archives Wills Online His body was carried to Bristol and was buried at All Saints' Church. His monument was designed by James Gibbs with an effigy carved by John Michael Rysbrack. Colston never married, and settled a \\"considerable fortune in land\\" on his nephew Edward Colston (MP for Wells), when Edward married in 1704. Philanthropic works Colston's Almshouses Colston supported and endowed schools, houses for the poor, almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere and his name features widely on Bristol buildings and landmarks. However, it not known how much Colston gave to such charities. In Bristol, he founded almshouses in King Street and Colstons Almshouses on St Michael's Hill, endowed Queen Elizabeth's Hospital school, and helped found Colston's Hospital, a boarding school which opened in 1710 leaving an endowment to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral. David Hughson, writing in 1808, described Colston as \\"the great benefactor of the city of Bristol, who, in his lifetime, expended more than 70,000L. [£] in charitable institutions\\". The Colston Society, which had operated for 275 years commemorating Colston, latterly as a charity, decided to disband in 2020. Memorials Engraving of Colston's monument in All Saints' Church, Bristol from Bristol Past and Present (1882) Buildings in Bristol named in memory of Colston include the Colston Tower and Colston Hall. Colston Avenue and Colston Street are also named after him, as is a regional bread bun, the Colston bun. A statue of Colston is on the exterior of Bristol Guildhall, built 1843–46. There is a 1870 stained-glass window by Clayton and Bell to his memory in the north transept of St Mary Redcliffe. A window in Bristol Cathedral was dedicated to Colston's memory; the Cathedral announced in June 2020 that they will remove the window. =City-centre memorial statue= John Cassidy, formerly in The Centre, Bristol, erected in 1895, toppled in 2020 In 1895, 174 years after Colston's death, a statue designed by John Cassidy was erected in the centre of Bristol, to commemorate Colston's philanthropy. It stood for 125 years, until 7 June 2020, when the statue was toppled and pushed into Bristol Harbour by demonstrators during the George Floyd protests. The statue was retrieved from the harbour four days later by Bristol City Council and taken to a secure location. It will later become a museum exhibit. In 2018, text for a new plaque for the statue was proposed intended to better inform the public about Colston's history. Conservative councillor Richard Eddy and the Society of Merchant Venturers, which Colston had belonged to, objected to the wording, and were successful in – among other things – removing mention of Colston's role as a Tory MP and the selective nature of his philanthropy, and disputed the number and ages of the children that died on his ships. The new wording was vetoed by the Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, who saw the Society as having had too much say in the process, instructing more parts of the community to be involved in producing the plaque. After the statue was toppled, the Merchant Venturers said that it had been \\"inappropriate\\" for them to have become involved in the rewording of the plaque in 2018, and that the removal of the statue was \\"right for Bristol\\". =Modern reappraisal= Since at least the 1990s, with increasing recognition of Colston's role in the slave trade, there has been growing criticism of his commemoration. The Dolphin Society, which was formed to continue Colston's philanthropy, now refers to 'the evils of slavery' and recognises that 'black citizens in Bristol today can suffer disadvantage in terms of education, employment and housing for reasons that connect back to the days of the trans- Atlantic slave trade'. The proportion of Colston's wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture. He also made money from trading in other commodities and interest from money lending. In April 2017, the charity that runs the venue known at the time as the Colston Hall, the Bristol Music Trust, announced that it would drop the name of Colston when it reopened after refurbishment in 2020. There had been protests and petitions calling for a name change and some concertgoers and artists had boycotted the venue because of the Colston name. Following the decision, petitions to retain the name of Colston reached almost 10,000 signatures, though the charity confirmed that the name change would go ahead. The hall was renamed as the Bristol Beacon in September 2020, after three years of consultation. In November 2017, Colston's Girls' School, which is funded by the Society of Merchant Venturers, announced that it would not drop the name of Colston because it was of \\"no benefit\\" to the school to do so. In summer 2018, after consultation with pupils and parents, Colston Primary School renamed itself Cotham Gardens Primary School. In February 2019, St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School announced that it would rename its Colston 'school house', after the American mathematician Katherine Johnson.

One aspect of the dispute is the differing interpretations of the maritime law: Turkey has not signed up to the Convention on the Continental Shelf nor the superseding United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, both of which Greece has signed up to; as such, Turkey doesn't recognize a legal continental shelf and EEZ around the Greek islands. Between 1998 and the early 2010s, the two countries came closer to overcoming the tensions through a series of diplomatic measures, particularly with a view to easing Turkey's accession to the European Union. However, differences over suitable diplomatic paths to a substantial solution remained unresolved, and as of 2020 tensions remain. Maritime and aerial zones of influence Several of the Aegean issues deal with the delimitation of both countries' zones of influence in the air and on the sea around their respective territories. These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many Aegean islands belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and the Dodecanese islands), some of them in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any of its zones of influence beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and areal zones of influence, such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension of such zones would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally. According to a popular perception of these issues in the two countries, Turkey is concerned that Greece might be trying to extend its zones of influence to such a degree that it would turn the Aegean effectively into a \\"Greek lake\\". Conversely, Greece is concerned that Turkey might try to \\"occupy half of the Aegean\\", i.e. establish Turkish zones of influence towards the middle of the Aegean, beyond the chain of outlying Greek islands, turning these into a kind of exclave surrounded by Turkish waters, and thus cutting them off from their motherland.Kemal Başlar (2001): Two facets of the Aegean Sea dispute: 'de lege lata' and 'de lege ferenda'. In: K. Başlar (ed.), Turkey and international law. Ankara. =Territorial waters= Territorial waters give the littoral state full control over air navigation in the airspace above, and partial control over shipping, although foreign ships (both civil and military) are normally guaranteed innocent passage through them. The standard width of territorial waters that countries are customarily entitled to has steadily increased in the course of the 20th century: from initially at the beginning of the century, to , and currently . The current value has been enshrined in treaty law by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (Art.3). In the Aegean the territorial waters claimed by both sides are still at 6 miles. The possibility of an extension to 12 miles has fuelled Turkish concerns over a possible disproportionate increase in Greek-controlled space. Turkey has refused to become a member of the convention and does not consider itself bound by it. Turkey considers the convention as res inter alios acta, i.e. a treaty that can only be binding to the signing parties but not to others. Greece, which is a party to the convention, has stated that it reserves the right to apply this rule and extend its waters to 12 miles at some point in the future, although it has never actually attempted to do so. It holds that the 12-mile rule is not only treaty law but also customary law, as per the wide consensus established among the international community. Against this, Turkey argues that the special geographical properties of the Aegean Sea make a strict application of the 12-mile rule in this case illicit in the interest of equity.Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg (1989): Der Ägäis- Konflikt: Die Abgrenzung des Festlandsockels zwischen Griechenland und der Türkei und das Problem der Inseln im Seevölkerrecht. Berlin: Duncker und Humblot. Turkey has itself applied the customary 12-mile limit to its coasts outside the Aegean. Tensions over the 12-mile question ran highest between the two countries in the early 1990s, when the Law of the Sea was going to come into force. On June 8, 1995, the Turkish parliament officially declared that unilateral action by Greece would constitute a casus belli, i.e. reason to go to war. This declaration has been condemned by Greece as a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, which forbids \\"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\\". =National airspace= The national airspace is normally defined as the airspace covering a state's land territory and its adjacent territorial waters. National airspace gives the sovereign state a large degree of control over foreign air traffic. While civil aviation is normally allowed passage under international treaties, foreign military and other state aircraft (unlike military vessels in the territorial waters) do not have a right to free passage through another state's national airspace. The delimitation of national airspace claimed by Greece is unique, as it does not coincide with the boundary of the territorial waters. Greece claims of airspace, as opposed to currently 6 miles of territorial waters. Since 1974, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the validity of the outer 4-mile belt of airspace that extends beyond the Greek territorial waters. Turkey cites the statutes of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of 1948, as containing a binding definition that both zones must coincide.Embassy of Turkey in Washington: Aegean Disputes Against this, Greece argues that: * its claim predates the ICAO statute, having been fixed in 1931, and that it was acknowledged by all its neighbours, including Turkey, before and after 1948, hence constituting an established right;Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Unilateral Turkish claims in the Aegean . * its 10-mile claim can also be interpreted as just a partial, selective use of the much wider rights guaranteed by the Law of the Sea, namely the right to a 12-mile zone both in the air and on the water; * Greek territorial waters are set at the 6-mile boundary only because of Turkey's casus belli. The conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations, with Turkish aircraft flying in the outer 4-mile zone of contentious airspace and Greek aircraft intercepting them. These encounters often lead to so-called \\"dog-fights\\", dangerous flight maneuvers that have repeatedly ended in casualties on both sides. In one instance in 1996, it has been alleged that a Turkish plane was accidentally shot down by a Greek one.The incident was first described as an accident. In 2004, a Greek newspaper published claims that the Turkish plane had unintentionally been shot down by the Greek one. The shootdown was confirmed by the Turkish government but denied by the Greek side . =Continental shelf= Conflicting claims to continental shelf and EEZ areas in the eastern Mediterranean. Blue: areas claimed by Greece and Cyprus; red: areas claimed by Turkey. In the context of the Aegean dispute, the term continental shelf refers to a littoral state's exclusive right to economic exploitation of resources on and under the sea-bed, for instance oil drilling, in an area adjacent to its territorial waters and extending into the High Seas. The width of the continental shelf is commonly defined for purposes of international law as not exceeding 200 nautical miles. Where the territories of two states lie closer opposite each other than double that distance, the division is made by the median line. The concept of the continental shelf is closely connected to that of an exclusive economic zone, which refers to a littoral state's control over fishery and similar rights. Both concepts were developed in international law from the middle of the 20th century, and were codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. The dispute between Turkey and Greece is to what degree the Greek islands off the Turkish coast should be taken into account for determining the Greek and Turkish economic zones. Turkey argues that the notion of \\"continental shelf\\", by its very definition, implies that distances should be measured from the continental mainland, claiming that the sea-bed of the Aegean geographically forms a natural prolongation of the Anatolian land mass. This would mean for Turkey to be entitled to economic zones up to the median line of the Aegean (leaving out, of course, the territorial waters around the Greek islands in its eastern half, which would remain as Greek exclaves.) Greece, on the other hand, claims that all islands must be taken into account on an equal basis. This would mean that Greece would gain the economic rights to almost the whole of the Aegean. In this matter, Greece has the UN Law of the Sea on its side, although the Convention restricts the application of this rule to islands of a notable size, as opposed to small uninhabitable islets and rocks. The precise delimitation of the economic zones is the only one of all the Aegean issues where Greece has officially acknowledged that Turkey has legitimate interests that might require some international process of arbitration or compromise between the two sides. Turkey cites the resolution of certain International Court of Justice cases like Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia),https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/124 Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea case, Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case where court had used equitable approach and limited the continental shelves of islands. Tensions over the continental shelf were particularly high during the mid-1970s and again the late 1980s, when it was believed that the Aegean Sea might hold rich oil reserves. Turkey at that time conducted exploratory oceanographic research missions in parts of the disputed area. These were perceived as a dangerous provocation by Greece, which led to a buildup of mutual military threats in 1976 and again in 1987. =Turkey's \\"Blue Homeland\\" claims= On 2 September 2019, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appeared in a photograph with a map that depicted nearly half of the Aegean Sea and an area up to the eastern coast of Crete as belonging to Turkey. The map was displayed during an official ceremony at the National Defense University of Turkey in Istanbul and shows an area labelled as \\"Turkey's blue homeland\\" stretching up to the median line of the Aegean, enclosing the Greek islands in that part of the Aegean without any indication of the Greek territorial waters around them. The Greek side expressed its regret, with the Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias stating that Turkey's tactics are \\"communication campaigns that cannot change international legitimacy, merely establishing Turkey's image as a perpetrator\\". Lodging claims in UN On 13 November 2019, Turkey submitted to the United Nations a series of claims to Exclusive Economic Zones in the Eastern Mediterranean that are in conflict with Greek claims to the same areas – including a sea zone extending west of the southeastern Aegean island of Rhodes and south of Crete. The Turkish claims were made in an official letter by Turkey's Permanent Representative to the UN Feridun Sinirlioglu, which reflect Ankara's notion of a \\"Blue Homeland\\" (Mavi Vatan). Greece condemned these claims as legally unfounded, incorrect and arbitrary, and an outright violation of Greece's sovereignty. Turkey's view Turkey holds the view, unlike most other relevant states, that no islands can have a full Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and should only be entitled to a 12 nautical mile reduced EEZ or no EEZ at all rather than the usual 200 miles that Turkey and every other country are entitled to. In this context, Turkey, for the first time on December 1, 2019, claimed that the Greek island of Kastellorizo shouldn't have any EEZ at all, because, from the equity-based Turkish viewpoint, it is a small island immediately across the Turkish mainland (which, according to Turkey, has the longest coastline), and isn't supposed to generate a maritime jurisdiction area four thousand times larger than its own surface. Furthermore, according to Turkey's Foreign Ministry, an EEZ has to be coextensive with the continental shelf, based on the relative lengths of adjacent coastlines and described any opposing views supporting the right of islands to their EEZ as \\"maximalist and uncompromising Greek and Greek Cypriot claims\\". On 20 January 2020, the Turkish President Erdogan challenged even the rights of Crete, Greece's largest island and 5th largest in the Mediterranean, stating that \\"They talk about a continental shelf around Crete. There is no continental shelf around the islands, there is no such thing, there, it is only sovereign waters.\\" Turkey's view, however, is a 'unique' interpretation not shared by any other country and not in accordance to the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) treaty, ratified by 167 countries but not Turkey. Turkey has refused to ratify the UNCLOS, and argues that it is not bound by its provisions that award islands maritime zones. The UNCLOS, and particularly Article 121 clearly states that the islands can have exclusive economic zones and continental shelf just like every other land territory. The Ambassadors of the United States and Russia to Athens, Geoffrey Pyatt and Andrey Maslov respectively, while commenting on Turkey's view, stated that all the islands have the same rights to EEZ and continental shelf as the mainlands do. The then US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Aaron Wess Mitchell, criticized the Turkish view, stating that it \\"is a minority of one versus the rest of the world.\\" =Turkey-GNA maritime agreement= On 28 November 2019, President Erdoğan signed a controversial Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Istanbul with the Prime Minister of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord of Libya (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, to demarcate maritime zones in the Eastern Mediterranean on an area between Turkey and Libya, appearing to \\"write [the Greek island of] Crete off the map entirely\\" in the words of Foreign Policy's Keith Johnson. This agreement drew condemnation by Greece and the international community, including the rival Tobruk-based government led by the Libyan House of Representatives and Khalifa Haftar, the European Union, United States, Russia, Egypt, Cyprus, Malta, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Serbia, Israel, Syria, Bahrein, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Arab League, as a violation of the International Law of the Sea and the article 8 of the Skhirat Agreement which prohibites the Libyan Prime Minister from solely clinching international deals without consent of all the cabinet members. The Libyan House of Representatives consequently started a bid to suspend the GNA from the Arab League, but did not succeed. The United States stated that it was \\"provocative\\" and a threat to the stability of the region. Acting foreign minister Israel Katz announced Israel's opposition to the maritime border accord between Ankara and Tripoli, and confirmed that the deal was \\"illegal\\" according to the Israeli official position, while at the same time noting that Israel does not want a conflict with Turkey. On 18 October 2020, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag)'s research service reviewed the Turkey-GNA maritime deal and found it to be illegal under international law, and detrimental to third parties. Post-agreement developments In response to these developments, the GNA Ambassador to Greece Mohamed Younis Menfi was summoned to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Athens, where he was given an ultimatum of seven days, to disclose until 5 December the agreement his country signed with Turkey on maritime boundaries, or will be considered \\"persona non-grata\\" and be expelled from Greece. The authorities of the European Union also urged for the disclosure of the deal's details. Also, the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with the Turkish President on the sidelines of the 2019 London summit to discuss about it. Greek Foreign Minister Dendias revealed that, earlier this year, in September, his GNA counterpart, foreign minister Mohamed Taher Siala had reassured the Greek side that Libya would never sign any illegal agreements with Turkey that would violate the Greek sovereign rights. On 6 December, the GNA Ambassador to Athens was expelled from Greece, prompting strong reactions in both the GNA and Turkey. Furthermore, the President of the Tobruk-based Libyan Parliament, Agila Saleh Issa Gwaider, who condemned and opposed the GNA-Turkey deal, was invited to Athens by the President of the Greek Parliament Konstantinos Tasoulas for talks. Ankara asked for the agreement on maritime boundaries from the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the Libyan Civil War, in exchange for Turkey's long-time support against the rival Tobruk-based House of Representatives. It is believed that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is exploiting the weakness of the GNA headed by Fayez al-Sarraj to force it to sign \\"illegal\\" agreements which are a serious breach of international laws that disregards the lawful rights of other eastern Mediterranean countries. Through these exploitations, Turkey is trying to assert its regional power and its control of the Mediterranean sea, at the expense of the rights of the other Mediterranean nations and undermining the peace-making efforts to resolve the Libyan Civil War and the curb of migrant influx to Europe. On 4 December 2019, the Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Fatih Dönmez, announced Turkey's intentions to start awarding licences to drills for natural gas in Greek waters which Ankara claimed through the Turkey-GNA deal, once it is approved by the two countries' parliaments. The same day, Turkish President Erdogan stated that he is \\"ready\\" to start negotiations with Athens for the delimitation of maritime borders between Turkey and Greece, under the condition that the negotiations are based on Turkey's peculiar perception which is stripping the Greek islands of their sovereign rights, and is violating the UNCLOS treaty. The intentions for drills in Greek waters, was confirmed by President Erdogan on a public broadcast of the Mavi Vatan map and the Turkey-GNA deal. On 5 December 2019, the Turkish Parliament ratified the contentious GNA-Turkey maritime borders deal, where it had a strong backing by four of Turkey's five major political parties - with the exception of the pro- Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HDP). The Libyan Parliament however blocked the ratification and rejected the deal unanimously, with the President of the Parliament, Aguila Saleh Issa, sending a letter to the United Nations declaring it as null and void. Even though the ratification by the Libyan Parliament failed, GNA deposited the maritime agreement to the United Nations on December 27,Letter dated 26 December 2019 from the Charge d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Libya to the UN addressed to the SG with Turkey following on March 2 of the next year.Letter dated 27 February 2020 from the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the UN addressed to the SG On 14 July 2020, it is revealed that five countries sent a joint note verbale to the UN Secretariat calling for the agreement to not be registered and accepted, noting that, per UN procedures, its ratification by the Libyan Parliament is a prerequisite. On October 1, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, registered the Turkey-GNA deal on the delimitation of maritime jurisdiction areas in the Mediterranean. The agreement \\"has been registered with the Secretariat, in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations,\\" said the certificate of registration. Experts fear a destabilization of the East Mediterranean and NATO due to Turkey's aggressive moves and that an armed conflict between Turkey and Greece draws closer. On 9 December, the vessels of the Libyan Navy which are under the control of the Libyan National Army, announced that they received mandate to sink any Turkish research vessels or drillships that may attempt to conduct researches south of Crete, as part of the Turkey-GNA deal. In reaction, France signaled its intention to send French frigates and ships to the south of Crete, in coordination with Athens, and Italy sent the Italian frigate \\"Martinengo\\" to monitor, patrol and safeguard the sea around Cyprus, which has been the subject of claims by Turkey. In July 2020, France and Austria have called for sactions against Turkey, such as the termination of the Turkey’s EU accession talks. In the same context the EU's Foreign Policy Council convened and agreed for a framework of sanctions to be prepared for use in the event Turkey attempts any violations of Greece's sovereign rights. The Greek FM Dendias expressed his country's readiness to activate the Mutual Defence Clause (Article 42) of the EU's Lisbon Treaty for military assistance. On 30 May 2020, the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) applied to the Turkish Ministry of Energy for exploration permits on the Greek continental shelf, just 6 miles off Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes. TPAO's applications were published to the Turkey's Government Gazette, with a map showing the 24 blocks that Ankara has demarcated from Turkey's shores to the point where its claimed sea borders meet these of Libya, based on the Turkey-GNA maritime agreement. This promted strong reactions both in Greece and abroad, with the Turkish Ambassador to Athens, Burak Özügergin, being summoned to the Greek Foreign Ministry, and the European Union's High Representative of Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell warning Ankara that the good EU-Turkey relations \\"will depend critically on the respect of the sovereignty of Cyprus and Greece on the waters under dispute\\". Furthermore, the United States criticized Turkey, with the US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis R. Fannon stating, during a quadrilateral conference organized by both the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce and the Atlantic Council with the participation of USA, Greece, Israel and Cyprus, that such \\"provocative actions\\" must end and that the Turkey-GNA agreement \\"cannot as a legal matter affect the rights or obligations of third states\\" such as Greece. Greece - Italy EEZ agreement On 9 June, and in response to Turkey's moves in the region, Greece and Italy signed through their Foreign Ministers Nikos Dendias and Luigi Di Maio a \\"historic\\" agreement for the demarcation of the EEZ between the two countries. The agreement confirms the full rights of islands to their continental shelf and EEZ, in line with the UNCLOS. It uses the median line that was used for the 1977 Italy-Greece continental shelf demarcation agreement as the basis of the EEZ boundary. In the mutually agreed minor adjustments, part of the EEZ of the small Greek islands of Strofades, Othoni, and Mathraki was traded off for an equal area elsewhere (i.e part of the EEZ of Italy's Calabria). According to Dendias, this creates an extremely favorable legal precedent for Greece in its dispute with Turkey. The United States, the Libyan House of Representatives, and the LNA led by Halifa Haftar, welcomed the EEZ agreement between Greece and Italy, with the US calling it \\"exemplary\\" and \\"an example of how these things should be done [in the region]\\", while reiterating their opposition to the Turkey-GNA EEZ agreement. Following the agreement, the Libyan House of Representatives sent an official invitation to the Hellenic Parliament for a similar EEZ agreement to be reached between Libya and Greece too, with talks beginning on July 1. Dendias stated that Libyan-Greek talks are \\"not within the arbitrariness that so-called Sarraj-Turkey memorandum is constituting\\", but within the framework of UNCLOS and in continuation of the 2010 talks between the two countries. In this context, a committee of experts is formed by the President of the Libyan Parliament, Aguila Saleh. The LNA published a map with the proposed EEZ boundaries between Libya and Greece, in which Libya fully acknowledges the Greek islands' rights to their continental shelf and EEZ. Furthermore, on June 18, a high-level delegation from Greece visited Egypt to negotiate and sign an agreement demarcating the Egyptian-Greek EEZ as well. In July 2020, France and Austria have called for sanctions against Turkey, such as the termination of the Turkey’s EU accession talks. In the same context the EU's Foreign Policy Council convened and agreed for a framework of sanctions to be prepared for use in the event Turkey attempts any violations of Greece's sovereign rights. The Greek FM Dendias expressed his country's readiness to activate the Mutual Defence Clause (Article 42) of the EU's Lisbon Treaty for military assistance. On 21 July, Turkey announced plans for a seismic survey south and east of the Greek island of Kastellorizo with the research vessel \\"Oruç Reis\\", and for this purpose it issued a Navtex covering parts of the Greek, Egyptian and Cypriot waters, prompting strong reactions both in Greece and abroad. The Greek embassy in Ankara sent a complaint to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Egypt considers the move as an encroachment of its waters, and Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned Turkey with consequences. Turkey dispatched its naval forces to the region around Kastellorizo, and Turkish armed jets conducted low overflights and dogfights with their Greek counterparts above the island, causing the tourists to evacuate it, and the Greek Armed Forces to be placed on high alert. The Turkish Ambassador to Berlin, Ali Kemal Aydın, was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel held phone calls with the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the Turkish President Tayip Erdogan in a bid to de-escalate the situation. According to the German tabloid newspaper Bild, it was Merkel's last-minute intervention that prevented a crisis between Greece and Turkey. This was later confirmed by the German Defence Minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Along with Germany, France, Spain and the United States also backed Greece, with the French President Emmanuel Macron calling for sanctions against Turkey for the violation of Greece's sovereignty, the US envoy to Athens acknowledging Kastellorizo's \\"exactly the same\\" rights to EEZ and Continental Shelf as mainlands, and the State Department urging Turkey to halt its plans for surveys in the area around the island. As result, Turkey announced the suspension of its oil and gas exploration around Kastellorizo. Greece - Egypt EEZ agreement Several days later, on 6 August, the foreign ministers of Egypt and Greece, Sameh Shoukry and Nikos Dendias respectively, signed a maritime agreement partially demarcating the EEZs between the two countries, in line with the UNCLOS which recognizes the right of the islands to their continental shelf and EEZ. According to the Greek side, the Egyptian-Greek agreement cancels in practice the Turkish-GNA memorandum. Turkey opposed the agreement and considers it \\"null and void\\", claiming that \\"there is no mutual sea border between Egypt and Greece\\". Similarly, the Tripoli-based GNA government led by Al-Sarraj condemned it as a \\"violation of Libya's maritime rights\\". On the other hand, the Tobruk-based LNA government led by Haftar, Saudi Arabia and the United States, supported and welcomed it, with LNA stating that Greece \\"should solidify a EEZ with the only democratically elected legislative body in Libya, the House of Representatives\\" and the State Departmnent stating that it encourages the peaceful settlement of disputes. Also, Manfred Weber, head of the European People's Party, the largest party in the European Parliament, welcomed the Egypt-Greece agreement as a positive development that \\"strengthens stability in the East Mediterranean,\\" and urged for the European Union to \\"stand firmly with Greece\\" against what he called as Turkish attempts that \\"undermine international law in the region\\". In response to this, Turkey announced the next day that it resumed its seismic surveys south of Kastellorizo. Τhe US, the EU, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, North Macedonia, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Armenia expressed their opposition to Turkey's renewed explorations in the East Mediterranean, while Azerbaijan counteracted to Armenia's position by lending its support for Turkey's moves. On 14 August 2020, Greece's and Turkey's ships collided and suffered minor damages and France intervened by sending its naval forces to the East Mediterranean, to Greece's aid, followed by the United Arab Emirates whose Fighter Jets are stationed at the Souda Bay Naval Base, in Crete. Also, the United States are seeking to beef up their military presence in the East Med and for this purpose, assigned the USS Hershel \\"Woody\\" Williams to the Souda Bay base as its new permanent home, and talks on moving US assets from the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, to Souda Bay opened. Joseph Borell announced that the European Union is preparing a list of sanctions against Turkey, including tough economic measures, and the former Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticized openly his own country's \\"power projection\\" in the East Mediterranean, which, according to him, risks causing a military conflict. On 18 August, the Egyptian Parliament ratified the Greece - Egypt EEZ Agreement with the Greek Parliament following suit, 9 days later. Greece announced that reaching EEZ agreements with Albania and Cyprus are among its next priorities. On September 17, the European Parliament condemned Turkey for its violations of the Greek and Cypriot EEZs and called on the European Council to prepare further sanctions. Eventually, due to Turkey's diplomatic isolation, and just a week ahead of the EU Summit where the looming sanctions against Turkey for its drilling activities are planned to be evaluated, the research vessel Oruç Reis was withdrawn from Kastellorizo and the Turkish research surveys on the Greek continental shelf were halted. Turkey agreed to resort to diplomatic means for resolving its maritime disputes with Greece. Turkey’s economy is dependent on foreign markets and especially the European Union, for exports, imports, short-term finance and technology, and thus, the EU's tough economic sanctions could have a \\"fatal\\" impact on the Turkish economy and the Turkish President Erdogan’s political survival. The prospect of EU sanctions also have contributed to the Turkish Lira's de-evaluation to record-low levels, and thus complicating the economic situation in the country. The United States, which criticized Turkey's assertive policies in the region, welcomed Ankara's decission to adopt a more diplomatic stance over its maritime dispute with Greece, with the head of the American foreign policy, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo stating that \\"the way conflict is resolved is not through shows of force, it’s not through demonstrations of power, it’s through dialogue. It’s through international systems, agreement, conversations, dialogue. That’s how these maritime disputes ought to be resolved. We’ve watched the Greeks move in that direction trying to achieve that. We hope the Turkish Government will see it the same way\\". Additionally, Pompeo sided with the Greek side on the dispute, by asking for a solution that is \\"reflective of the fundamental rights of the citizens of Greece\\". Further developments On 8 October 2020, Turkey and Greece agreed, under Germany's mediation and with the USA's full consultation, to resume exploratory talks for resolving their maritime disputes. However, a few days later, on October 11, Turkey retreated from these talks and resumed its gunboat diplomacy by releasing a NAVTEX announcing that it will be conducting surveys on the waters just 6.5 miles off Kastellorizo and redeployed its research vessel Oruç Reis, escorted by Turkish frigates, for this purpose. These Turkish moves drew the International community's condemnation, with Berlin decrying them as a \\"serious blow\\" to efforts at easing tensions in the East Mediterranean and accusing Ankara for \\"interplay between detente and provocation\\",, the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas cancelling his planned visit to Ankara, and along with France, warning Turkey with consequences, Greece's Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias declaring that \\"the Turkish leadership has shown it is not a credible interlocutor. Its calls for dialogue are only a pretext. The international community must judge [Ankara] on the basis of actions, not words. We must all face reality before it is too late\\", the United States \\"deploring\\" Ankara for its moves, which the State Department described as \\"calculated provocations\\", Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz condemning Oruc Reis' redeployment and warning Turkey of sanctions, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry rejecting Turkey's gunboat diplomacy and policy of territorial expansion in the region, Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde warning that the Oruç Reis's redeployment is leading to new tensions instead of contributing to de-escalation, and Russia backing Greece's right to expand its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles and reaffirms that the UNCLOS is a \\"cornerstone\\" of the international law and applies to the Mediterranean Sea. Manfred Weber of the EPP reiterated his call for EU sanctions against Turkey, stating that these initial de- escalation moves by Erdogan were purposeful only, with the aim of avoiding sanctions against his country at the recent European Council. Turkey however rebuffed international criticism of its research vessel's redeployment, insisting that the Oruç Reis is operating in what it claims as \\"Turkish waters\\". On 17 October, Turkey passed a law that deliberately expanded its search and rescue (SAR) area to cover all the territories it claims as part of its Blue Homeland. Under international law, however, this is illegal, as countries cannot deliberately expand their SAR areas without previous agreements with their neighboring states. Greece protested strongly to this unilateral extension of Turkish SAR, which overlaps with the sovereign rights of the Greek islands and their surrounding waters, announcing that it will file complaints with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Turkey described the Greek protests as \\"groundless\\", insisting that the expansion was done \\"to ensure the safety of the activities\\" within the Greek continental shelf which Ankara claims as \\"Turkish\\". =EastMed pipeline= On 2 January 2020, the leaders of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel signed an accord to build the EastMed pipeline. The planned pipeline will transport natural gas from the Levantine Basin to Greece and from there to Italy and the rest of Europe. Energy expert Brenda Schaffer interprets the EastMed pipeline (forecasted to be able to cater to 10% of Europe's gas needs, and decrease reliance on Russia) as a joint attempt to exclude Turkey from the \\"Club Med\\" gas club, and the decision to sign the pipeline accord was taken in response to the Turkish-GNA deal. =Flight information regions= Unlike the issues described so far, the question of flight information regions (FIR) does not affect the two states' sovereignty rights in the narrow sense. A FIR is a zone of responsibility assigned to a state within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It relates to the responsibility for regulating civil aviation. A FIR may stretch beyond the national airspace of a country, i.e. over areas of high seas, or in some cases even over the airspace of another country. It does not give the responsible state the right to prohibit flights by foreign aircraft; however, foreign aircraft are obliged to submit flight plans to the authorities administrating the FIR. Two separate disputes have arisen over flight control in the Aegean: the issue of a unilaterally proposed revision of the FIR demarcation, and the question of what rights and obligations arise from the FIR with respect to military as opposed to civil flights. Demarcation By virtue of an agreement signed in 1952, the whole airspace over the Aegean, up to the boundary of the national airspace of Turkey, has been assigned to Athens FIR, administered by Greece. Shortly after the Cyprus crisis of 1974, Turkey unilaterally attempted to change this arrangement, issuing a notice to airmen (NOTAM) stating that it would take over the administration of the eastern half of the Aegean airspace, including the national airspace of the Greek islands in that area. Greece responded with a declaration rejecting this move, and declaring the disputed zone unsafe for aviation due to the conflicting claims to authority. This led to some disruption in civil aviation in the area. Turkey later changed its stance, and since 1980 has returned to recognizing Athens FIR in its original demarcation. In practice, the FIR demarcation is currently no longer a disputed issue. Turkish military overflights the current controversy over the FIR relates to the question whether the Greek authorities have a right to oversee not only civil but also military flight activities in the international parts of the Aegean airspace. According to common international practice, military aircraft normally submit flight plans to FIR authorities when moving in international airspace, just like civil aircraft do. Turkey refuses to do so, citing the ICAO charter of 1948, which explicitly restricts the scope of its regulations to civil aircraft, arguing that therefore the practice of including military aircraft in the same system is optional. Greece, in contrast, argues that it is obligatory on the basis of later regulations of the ICAO, which it claims have given states the authority to issue more wide- reaching restrictions in the interest of civil aviation safety. This disagreement has led to similar practical consequences as the issue of 6 versus 10 miles of national airspace, as Greece considers all Turkish military flights not registered with its FIR authorities as transgressions of international air traffic regulations, and routinely has its own air force jets intercepting the Turkish ones. In popular perception in Greece, the issue of Turkish flights in the international part of Athens FIR is often confused with that of the Turkish intrusions in the disputed outer 4-mile belt of Greek airspace. However, in careful official usage, Greek authorities and media distinguish between \\"violations\\" (παραβιάσεις) of the national airspace, and \\"transgressions\\" (παραβάσεις) of traffic regulations, i.e. of the FIR. One of the routine interception maneuvers led to a fatal accident on 23 May 2006. Two Turkish F-16s and one reconnaissance F-4 were flying in the international airspace over the southern Aegean at without having submitted flight plans to the Greek FIR authorities. They were intercepted by two Greek F-16s off the coast of the Greek island Karpathos. During the ensuing mock dog fight, a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16 collided midair and subsequently crashed. The pilot of the Turkish plane survived the crash, but the Greek pilot died. The incident also highlighted another aspect of the FIR issue, a dispute over conflicting claims to responsibility for maritime search and rescue operations. The Turkish pilot reportedly refused to be rescued by the Greek forces that had been dispatched to the area. After the incident, both governments expressed an interest to revive an earlier plan of establishing a direct hotline between the air force commands of both countries in order to prevent escalation of similar situations in the future. Islands Islands by date of accession to Greece Islands by demilitarization status There have been a number of disputes related to the territories of the Greek islands themselves. These have related to the demilitarized status of some of the main islands in the area; to Turkish concerns over alleged endeavours by Greece to artificially expand settlements to previously uninhabited islets; and to the existence of alleged \\"grey zones\\", an undetermined number of small islands of undetermined sovereignty. =Demilitarized status= The question of the demilitarized status of some major Greek islands is complicated by a number of facts. Several of the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean as well as the Turkish straits region were placed under various regimes of demilitarization in different international treaties. The regimes developed over time, resulting in difficulties of treaty-interpretation. However, the military status of the islands in question did not constitute a serious problem in the bilateral relations until the Cyprus crisis of 1974, after which both Greece and Turkey re-interpreted the stipulations of the treaties. Greece, claiming an inalienable right to defend itself against Turkish aggression, reinforced its military and National Guard forces in the region. Furthermore, Greece maintains the position that it has the right to militarize its islands in the same context as the rest of Europe, where the appliance of demilitarization statute on islands and territories ceased with the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact; i.e. the cessation of demilitarization of Italy's Panteleria, Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa islands, and West Germany from the NATO side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, and Hungary from the Warsaw Pact's side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Finland. Turkey, on the other hand, denounces this as an aggressive act by Greece and as a breach of international treaties. From a legal perspective, three groups of islands may be distinguished: (a) the islands right off the Turkish Dardanelles straits, i.e. Lemnos and Samothrace; (b) the Dodecanese islands in the southeast Aegean; and (c) the remaining northeast Aegean islands (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria). Lemnos and Samothrace These islands were placed under a demilitarization statute by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, to counterbalance the simultaneous demilitarization of the Turkish straits area (the Dardanelles and Bosphorus), Imbros and Tenedos. The demilitarization on the Turkish side was later abolished through the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits in 1936. Greece holds that, by superseding the relevant sections of the earlier treaty, the convention simultaneously lifted also the Greek obligations with respect to these islands. Against this, Turkey argues that the Montreux treaty did not mention the islands and has not changed their status. Greece, on the other hand, cites Turkish official declarations, by the then Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rustu Aras, to that effect made in 1936,Gazette of the Minutes of the Turkish National Assembly, volume 12. 31 July 1936, page 309 assuring the Greek side that Turkey would consider the Greek obligations lifted. Dodecanese These islands were placed under a demilitarization statute after the Second World War by the Treaty of peace with Italy (1947), when Italy ceded them to Greece. Italy had previously not been under any obligation towards Turkey in this respect. Turkey, in turn, was not a party to the 1947 treaty, having been neutral during WWII. Greece therefore holds that the obligations it incurred towards Italy and the other parties in 1947 are res inter alios acta for Turkey in the sense of Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third country, and that Turkey thus cannot base any claims on them. Turkey argues that the demilitarization agreement constitutes a status treaty (an objective régime), where according to general rules of treaty law such an exclusion does not hold. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria The remaining islands (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria) were placed under a partial demilitarization statute by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. It prohibited the establishment of naval bases and fortifications, but allowed Greece to maintain a limited military contingent recruited from the local population, as well as police forces. With respect to these islands, Greece has not claimed that the treaty obligations have been formally superseded. However, in recent years it has argued that it is entitled to discount them, invoking Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. It argues that after the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus and the Turkish threat of war over the 12 miles issue, re-armament is an act of legitimate self-defence. =\\"Grey zones\\"= Imia/Kardak Imia/Kardak The first time a dispute between the two countries in the Aegean touched on questions of actual sovereignty over territories was in early 1996 at the tiny barren islets of Imia/Kardak, situated between the Dodecanese island chain and the Turkish mainland.Sezgin, I.Can (2009): Why they did not fight? A Study on the Imia/ Kardak Crisis (1995–1996) between Greece and Turkey, The conflict, triggered by the stranding of a Turkish merchant ship on the islets, was originally caused by factual inconsistencies between maps of the area, some of which assigned these islets to Greece, others to Turkey. The media of the two countries took up the issue and gave it a nationalistic turn, before the two governments even had the time to come to a full technical understanding of the true legal and geographical situation. Both governments finally adopted an intransigent stance, publicly asserting their own claims of sovereignty over the islets. The result was military escalation, which was perceived abroad as quite out of proportion with the size and significance of the rocks in question. The two countries were at the brink of war for a few days, until the crisis was defused with the help of foreign mediation.Ch. Maechling (1997): The Aegean sea: a crisis waiting to happen. US Naval Institute Proceeding 71–73. During the crisis and in the months following it, both governments elaborated legal arguments to support their claims to sovereignty. The arguments exchanged concerned the interpretation of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, which forms the principal basis for the legal status of territories in most of the region, as well as certain later diplomatic dealings between Turkey, Greece and Italy. Other \\"grey zones\\" In the wake of the Imia crisis, the Turkish government widened its argumentation to include not only Imia but also a possibly large number of other islands and small formations across the Aegean. Since then, Turkish authorities have spoken of \\"grey zones\\" of undetermined sovereignty. According to the Turkish argument, these islets, while not explicitly retained under Turkish sovereignty in 1923, were also not explicitly ceded to any other country, and their sovereignty has therefore remained objectively undecided. The Turkish government has avoided stating exactly which islets it wishes to include in this category. On various occasions, Turkish government sources have indicated that islands such as Pserimos, Agathonisi, Fournoi and Gavdos (situated south of Crete) might be included. Most of them, unlike Imia/Kardak, had undeniably been in factual Greek possession, which had never previously been challenged by Turkey, and all but the final two listed below have Greek residents and infrastructure. Furthermore, the islands are covered by previous treaties such as the Treaty of Lausanne, which defines Turkish sovereignty as limited to within 3 miles of the Anatolian mainland in the majority of cases. In a 2004 publication by Turkish authors close to the Turkish military leadership(Major)Ali Kurumahmut, Sertaç Başeren (2004): The twilight zones in the Aegean: (Un)forgotten Turkish islands. Ege'de gri bölgeler: Unutul(may)an Türk adaları. Ankara: Türk Tarih Kurumu. (). the following (among other, even smaller ones) were listed as potentially \\"grey\\" areas: * Oinousses (between Chios and the Turkish coast), * Antipsara (west of the islands of Psara and Khios), * Fournoi, * Arkoi, * Agathonisi (Gaidaros), * Pharmakonisi, * Kalolimnos (near Imia/Kardak), * Pserimos, * Gyali (between Kos and Nisyros), * Syrna (SE of Astypalaia) * Kandheliousa (south of Kos), * Vrachoi Kalogeroi (small rocks 41 km northeast of Andros) =Military overflights= While Turkey has not attempted to challenge Greek sovereignty on the ground, its claims about \\"grey area\\" islands add to the number of minor military incidents, already numerous due to the 10-mile airspace and the FIR issues. The Turkish Air Force routinely ignores Greek national airspace around such formations that it counts as grey zones. According to Greek press reports, the number of airspace violations rose sharply in 2006, as did the number of unauthorised Turkish military flights directly over Greek islands themselves. Renewed reports of systematic Turkish military flights directly over Greek islands like Pharmakonisi and Agathonisi were made in late 2008 and early 2009. During the late 2010s, tensions rose again as Turkish fighter aircraft increased the number of direct armed overflights above inhabited Greek islands. While most overflights continue to occur above small islands that Turkey considers \\"grey areas\\", such as Agathonisi or Oinousses, some incidents have also repeatedly been reported involving major and undisputed islands such as Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios or Leros. These overflights are perceived in Greece as among the most provocative acts by Turkey, directly challenging Greek territorial sovereignty. In 2020, Turkish fighter aircraft also begun overflights above the Greek mainland, on Evros. A regional Foreign Minister conference held on 11 May 2020 with the participation of Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece and the United Arab Emirates, concluded with a joint declaration condemning Turkey for its practice of conducting armed overflights above the inhabited Greek islands. Turkish incidents with Frontex In September 2009, a Turkish military radar issued a warning to a Latvian helicopter patrolling in the eastern Aegean—part of the EU's Frontex programme to combat illegal immigration—to leave the area. The Turkish General Staff reported that the Latvian Frontex aircraft had violated Turkish airspace west of Didim. According to a Hellenic Air Force announcement, the incident occurred as the Frontex helicopter—identified as an Italian-made Agusta A109—was patrolling in Greek air space near the small isle of Farmakonisi, which lies on a favorite route used by migrant smugglers ferrying mostly illegal migrants into Greece and the EU from the opposite Turkish coastline. Frontex officials stated that they simply ignored the Turkish warnings as they did not recognise their being in Turkish airspace and continued their duties. Another incident took place in October 2009 in the aerial area above the eastern Aegean sea, off the island of Lesbos. On 20 November 2009, the Turkish General Staff issued a press note alleging that an Estonian Border Guard aircraft Let L-410 UVP taking off from Kos on a Frontex mission had violated Turkish airspace west of Söke. Strategies of conflict resolution The decades since the 1970s have seen a repeated heightening and abating of political and military tensions over the Aegean. Thus, the crisis of 1987 was followed by a series of negotiations and agreements in Davos and Brussels in 1988. Again, after the Imia/Kardak crisis of 1996, there came an agreement over peaceful neighbourly relations reached at a meeting in Madrid in 1997. The period since about 1999 has been marked by a steady improvement of bilateral relations. For years, the Aegean dispute has been a matter not only about conflicting claims of substance. Rather, proposed strategies of how to resolve the substantial differences have themselves constituted a matter of heated dispute. Whereas Turkey has traditionally preferred to regard the whole set of topics as a political issue, requiring bilateral political negotiation, Greece views them as separate and purely legal issues,Agapakis, I. Η επίλυση των ελληνοτουρκικών διαφορών στο θαλάσσιο χώρο κατα το διεθνές δίκαιο, page 9 requiring only the application of existing principles of international law. Turkey has advocated direct negotiation, with a view to establishing what it would regard as an equitable compromise. Greece refuses to accept any process that would put it under pressure to engage in a give-and-take over what it perceives as inalienable and unnegotiable sovereign rights. Up to the late 1990s, the only avenue of conflict resolution that Greece deemed acceptable was to submit the issues separately to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The resulting stalemate between both sides over process was partially changed after 1999, when the European summit of Helsinki opened up a path towards Turkey's accession to the EU. In the summit agreement, Turkey accepted an obligation to solve its bilateral disputes with Greece before actual accession talks would start. This was perceived as giving Greece a new tactical advantage over Turkey in determining which paths of conflict resolution to choose. During the following years, both countries held regular bilateral talks on the level of technical specialists, trying to determine possible future procedures. According to press reports,A. Papachelas: \\"'Γκρίζες ζώνες' στις διαπραγματεύσεις με την Αγκυρα\\". Το Βήμα της Κυριακής, 16 May 2004. both sides seemed close to an agreement about how to submit the dispute to the court at The Hague, a step which would have fulfilled many of the old demands of Greece. However, a newly elected Greek government under Kostas Karamanlis, soon after it took office in March 2004, opted out of this plan, because Ankara was insisting that all the issues, including Imia/Kardak and the \\"grey zones\\", belonged to a single negotiating item. Athens saw them as separate. However, Greek policy remained at the forefront in advocating closer links between Ankara and the EU. This resulted in the European Union finally opening accession talks with Turkey without its previous demands having been fulfilled. According to some commentators, the 2020 fall of energy prices, combined with the discovery of gas within the Turkish EEZ in the Black Sea, there is enough energy in Turkey that further exploration for gas is unnecessary.

As a passport control officer for the British embassy in Berlin, Foley \\"bent the rules\\" and helped thousands of Jewish families escape from Nazi Germany after Kristallnacht and before the outbreak of the Second World War.Paldiel, Mordechai.Diplomat Heroes of the Holocaust (KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2007), pp. 8–17. He is officially recognised as a British Hero of the Holocaust and as a Righteous Among the Nations.  Early life  He was the third son of Isabella and Andrew Wood Foley, a Tiverton-born railway worker, whose family may have originated from Roscommon in Ireland in the early 1800s. After attending local schools in Somerset, Foley won a scholarship to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, where he was educated by the Jesuits. He then went to a Catholic seminary in France to train as a priest but transferred to the Université de France in Poitiers to study Classics. While there he reconsidered his vocation for the priesthood and decided instead to pursue an academic career. He travelled extensively in Europe, becoming fluent in both French and German. Foley graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Hertfordshire Regiment on 25 January 1917. He was appointed temporary Captain on 20 September 1917, while commanding an infantry company of the 1st Battalion the Hertfordshire Regiment, and was later with the 2nd/6th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment, during which time he was mentioned in despatches.Stourbridge County Express dated 10 May 1958 – Obituary Major F E Foley CMG.Anon (1964), p. 384.  Joining secret service  The story of his escape from Germany and his language skills had been noted by someone at the War Office. He was encouraged to apply for the Intelligence Corps. On 25 July 1918 Foley was promoted Lieutenant. In July 1918 he became part of a small unit which was responsible for recruiting and running networks of secret agents in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. After the Armistice he served for a short time in the Inter-Allied Military Commission of Control in Cologne. On 19 April 1920 he relinquished the temporary rank of captain, and in December 1921 retired from the Army with the rank of Captain. After the running down of the commission, he was offered the post of passport control officer in Berlin which was a cover for his main duties as head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) station. During the 1920s and 30s, Foley was successful in recruiting agents and acquiring key details of German military research and development. Foley is primarily remembered as a \\"British Schindler\\". In his role as passport control officer, he helped thousands of Jews escape from Nazi Germany. At the 1961 trial of former ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann, he was described as a \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" for the way he risked his own life to save Jews threatened with death by the Nazis. Despite having no diplomatic immunity and being liable to arrest at any time, Foley would bend the rules when stamping passports and issuing visas, to allow Jews to escape \\"legally\\" to Britain or Palestine, which was then controlled by the British. Sometimes he went further, going into internment camps to get Jews out, hiding them in his home, and helping them get forged passports. One Jewish aid worker estimated that he saved \\"tens of thousands\\" of people from the Holocaust. CMG award  Second World War  In 1939 and 1940, he was a passport control officer in Norway until the Germans invaded, when he was attached to C-in-C Norwegian Forces in the Field, for which services he received the Norwegian Knight's Cross of the Order of St. Olaf. Foley and Margaret Reid, his assistant, abandoned Oslo on 9 April 1940 during the German advance, and travelled to Lillehammer and Åndalsnes. Before leaving Oslo, Foley and Reid burned the documents in the UK legation. Foley helped Norway's commander in chief, General Otto Ruge, contact Britain to request assistance against the invader. Foley had his own radio transmitter that allowed Ruge to communicate with London independently of Norwegian landlines. Reid was a cipher expert who coded messages sent to Britain. Until minister Cecil Dormer arrived on 16 April, Foley acted as a UK representative with Norwegian authorities. Foley and Reid were evacuated from Molde by the British navy on 1 May.Reid, Margaret og Leif C. Rolstad (1980): April 1940: en krigsdagbok. Margaret Reids dagbok.

At Åndalsnes Foley presumably met Martin Linge, who acted as liaison officer.Haavardsholm, Espen: Martin Linge - min morfar. Oslo: Gyldendal, 1993 On 1 January 1941, he was awarded Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) as a Captain in respect of his services to the Foreign Office. In 1941, he was given the task of questioning Hitler's Deputy Rudolf Hess after Hess's flight to Scotland. After Hess was hospitalized in 1942, Foley helped coordinate MI5 and MI6 in running a network of double agents, the Double Cross System. Order of St. Olav  Later life  He returned to Berlin very soon after the war under the cover of Assistant Inspector General of the Public Safety Branch of the Control Commission in Germany, where he was involved in hunting for ex-SS war criminals. In 1949, Foley retired to Stourbridge, Worcestershire and died there in 1958. He is buried in Stourbridge Cemetery. On 27 April 1961, the Daily Mail carried the story, written by his widow, of his activities to save as many Jews as he possibly could with visas to the United Kingdom. When no excuse could be found for a visa to Britain, he contacted friends working in the embassies of other nations for their assistance in granting visas to their countries.Daily Mail, 27 April 1961 – article \\"Pimpernel Foley\\". His widow, Katharine Eva Foley, died on 17 April 1979 at her home in Sidmouth, Devon.

For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2. The sequence of practical numbers begins :1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 120, 126, 128, 132, 140, 144, 150.... Practical numbers were used by Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as Egyptian fractions. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.. The name \\"practical number\\" is due to . He noted that \\"the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10.\\" He rediscovered the number theoretical property of such numbers and was the first to attempt a classification of these numbers that was completed by and . This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even perfect number and every power of two is also a practical number. Practical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with prime numbers in many of their properties.; ; ; . Characterization of practical numbers The original characterisation by stated that a practical number cannot be a deficient number, that is one of which the sum of all divisors (including 1 and itself) is less than twice the number unless the deficiency is one. If the ordered set of all divisors of the practical number n is {d_1, d_2,..., d_j} with d_1=1 and d_j=n, then Srinivasan's statement can be expressed by the inequality :2nleq1+sum_{i=1}^j d_i. In other words, the ordered sequence of all divisors {d_1 of a practical number has to be a complete sub-sequence. This partial characterization was extended and completed by and who showed that it is straightforward to determine whether a number is practical from its prime factorization. A positive integer greater than one with prime factorization n=p_1^{alpha_1}...p_k^{alpha_k} (with the primes in sorted order p_1) is practical if and only if each of its prime factors p_i is small enough for p_i-1 to have a representation as a sum of smaller divisors. For this to be true, the first prime p_1 must equal 2 and, for every from 2 to , each successive prime p_i must obey the inequality :p_ileq1+sigma(p_1^{alpha_1}p_2^{alpha_2}dots p_{i-1}^{alpha_{i-1}})=1+prod_{j=1}^{i-1}frac{p_j^{alpha_j+1}-1}{p_j-1}, where sigma(x) denotes the sum of the divisors of x. For example, 2 × 32 × 29 × 823 = 429606 is practical, because the inequality above holds for each of its prime factors: 3 ≤ σ(2) + 1 = 4, 29 ≤ σ(2 × 32) + 1 = 40, and 823 ≤ σ(2 × 32 × 29) + 1 = 1171. The condition stated above is necessary and sufficient for a number to be practical. In one direction, this condition is necessary in order to be able to represent p_i-1 as a sum of divisors of n, because if the inequality failed to be true then even adding together all the smaller divisors would give a sum too small to reach p_i-1. In the other direction, the condition is sufficient, as can be shown by induction. More strongly, if the factorization of n satisfies the condition above, then any m le sigma(n) can be represented as a sum of divisors of n, by the following sequence of steps:; . * By induction on jin[1,alpha_k], it can be shown that p_k^jleq 1+sigma(n/p_k^{alpha_k-(j-1)}). Hence p_k^{alpha_k}leq 1+sigma(n/p_k). * Since the internals [q p_k^{alpha_k}, q p_k^{alpha_k}+sigma(n/p_k)] cover [1,sigma(n)] for 1leq qleq sigma(n/p_k^{alpha_k}), there are such a q and some rin[0,sigma(n/p_k)] such that m=q p_k^{alpha_k}+r. * Since qlesigma(n/p_k^{alpha_k}) and n/p_k^{alpha_k} can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of q as a sum of divisors of n/p_k^{alpha_k}. * Since rle sigma(n/p_k), and since n/p_k can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of r as a sum of divisors of n/p_k. * The divisors representing r, together with p_k^{alpha_k} times each of the divisors representing q, together form a representation of m as a sum of divisors of n. Properties *The only odd practical number is 1, because if n > 2 is an odd number, then 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct divisors of n. More strongly, observes that other than 1 and 2, every practical number is divisible by 4 or 6 (or both). *The product of two practical numbers is also a practical number. More strongly the least common multiple of any two practical numbers is also a practical number. Equivalently, the set of all practical numbers is closed under multiplication. *From the above characterization by Stewart and Sierpiński it can be seen that if n is a practical number and d is one of its divisors then n*d must also be a practical number. *In the set of all practical numbers there is a primitive set of practical numbers. A primitive practical number is either practical and squarefree or practical and when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. The sequence of primitive practical numbers begins ::1, 2, 6, 20, 28, 30, 42, 66, 78, 88, 104, 140, 204, 210, 220, 228, 260, 272, 276, 304, 306, 308, 330, 340, 342, 348, 364, 368, 380, 390, 414, 460 ... Relation to other classes of numbers Several other notable sets of integers consist only of practical numbers: *From the above properties with n a practical number and d one of its divisors (that is, d  n) then n*d must also be a practical number therefore six times every power of 3 must be a practical number as well as six times every power of 2. *Every power of two is a practical number. Powers of two trivially satisfy the characterization of practical numbers in terms of their prime factorizations: the only prime in their factorizations, p1, equals two as required. *Every even perfect number is also a practical number. This follows from Leonhard Euler's result that an even perfect number must have the form 2n − 1(2n − 1). The odd part of this factorization equals the sum of the divisors of the even part, so every odd prime factor of such a number must be at most the sum of the divisors of the even part of the number. Therefore, this number must satisfy the characterization of practical numbers. *Every primorial (the product of the first i primes, for some i) is practical. For the first two primorials, two and six, this is clear. Each successive primorial is formed by multiplying a prime number pi by a smaller primorial that is divisible by both two and the next smaller prime, pi − 1. By Bertrand's postulate, pi < 2pi − 1, so each successive prime factor in the primorial is less than one of the divisors of the previous primorial. By induction, it follows that every primorial satisfies the characterization of practical numbers. Because a primorial is, by definition, squarefree it is also a primitive practical number. *Generalizing the primorials, any number that is the product of nonzero powers of the first k primes must also be practical. This includes Ramanujan's highly composite numbers (numbers with more divisors than any smaller positive integer) as well as the factorial numbers.. Practical numbers and Egyptian fractions If n is practical, then any rational number of the form m/n with m < n may be represented as a sum ∑di/n where each di is a distinct divisor of n. Each term in this sum simplifies to a unit fraction, so such a sum provides a representation of m/n as an Egyptian fraction. For instance, :frac{13}{20}=frac{10}{20}+frac{2}{20}+frac{1}{20}=frac12+frac1{10}+frac1{20}. Fibonacci, in his 1202 book Liber Abaci lists several methods for finding Egyptian fraction representations of a rational number. Of these, the first is to test whether the number is itself already a unit fraction, but the second is to search for a representation of the numerator as a sum of divisors of the denominator, as described above. This method is only guaranteed to succeed for denominators that are practical. Fibonacci provides tables of these representations for fractions having as denominators the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100. showed that every number x/y has an Egyptian fraction representation with scriptstyle O(sqrt{log y}) terms. The proof involves finding a sequence of practical numbers ni with the property that every number less than ni may be written as a sum of scriptstyle O(sqrt{log n_{i-1}}) distinct divisors of ni. Then, i is chosen so that ni − 1 < y ≤ ni, and xni is divided by y giving quotient q and remainder r. It follows from these choices that scriptstylefrac{x}{y}=frac{q}{n_i}+frac{r}{yn_i}. Expanding both numerators on the right hand side of this formula into sums of divisors of ni results in the desired Egyptian fraction representation. use a similar technique involving a different sequence of practical numbers to show that every number x/y has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the largest denominator is scriptstyle O(frac{ylog^2 y}{loglog y}). According to a September 2015 conjecture by Zhi-Wei Sun,A Conjecture on Unit Fractions Involving Primes every positive rational number has an Egyptian fraction representation in which every denominator is a practical number. There is a proof for the conjecture on David Eppstein's blog.0xDE: Egyptian fractions with practical denominators  Analogies with prime numbers  One reason for interest in practical numbers is that many of their properties are similar to properties of the prime numbers. Indeed, theorems analogous to Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture are known for practical numbers: every positive even integer is the sum of two practical numbers, and there exist infinitely many triples of practical numbers x − 2, x, x + 2.. Melfi also showed that there are infinitely many practical Fibonacci numbers ; the analogous question of the existence of infinitely many Fibonacci primes is open. showed that there always exists a practical number in the interval [x2,(x + 1)2] for any positive real x, a result analogous to Legendre's conjecture for primes. This result on practical numbers on short intervals have subsequently improved by Melfi who proved that if s_n is the sequence of practical numbers, then for sufficiently large n and for a suitable A, :s_{n+1}-s_n Let p(x) count how many practical numbers are at most x. conjectured that p(x) is asymptotic to cx/log x for some constant c, a formula which resembles the prime number theorem, strengthening the earlier claim of that the practical numbers have density zero in the integers. Improving on an estimate of , found that p(x) has order of magnitude x/log x. proved Margenstern's conjecture by showing that :p(x) = frac{c x}{log x}left(1 + O!left(frac{log log x}{log x}right)right), where c=1.33607.... Thus the practical numbers are about 33.6% more numerous than the prime numbers. The exact value of the constant factor c is given by. : c= frac{1}{1-e^{-gamma}} sum_{n  text{practical}} frac{1}{n} Biggl( sum_{ple sigma(n)+1}frac{log p}{p-1} - log nBiggr) prod_{ple sigma(n)+1} left(1-frac{1}{p}right), where gamma is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and p runs over primes.

His recording career began in 1993 and he has used a number of different pseudonyms and band names, and released music in different styles on several record labels. He has also recorded music for short films, television advertisements and video games and has performed sound design work for television channels including the BBC, Channel 4 and MTV. Most recently he has provided the soundtrack for the hit Netflix sitcom Lovesick. History Si Begg studied at Trinity School and Mid Warwickshire college, becoming interested in electronic music from an early age. Begg confessed that the first electronic-based record he ever heard was \\"Probably Jean Michel Jarre; my uncle used to be into his stuff, and used to play it in the car. My brother's mate's dad also had Tubular Bells and stuff like that. I remember being really into all the sounds and noises, the total futurism. And I was right into Star Wars and Tron and all those kinda kids' sci-fi things.\\"Bucking the Funk, Andrez Bergen. Zebra, Inpress, September 1999. Listening to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show in the late 1980s, Begg was introduced to early Chicago acid and bands like Warp's LFO, Cabaret Voltaire, Severed Heads and Negativland. This influenced him to move away from playing guitar and drums with schoolmates and toward creating cut-up electronica with fellow electronic musicians, under the group name Cabbage Head Collective. Career Begg initially gained experience working as a sound engineer in the early 1990s, helping to produce live music and studio albums for other artists, and began DJing in 1991. He began creating his own music in 1993, and a year later, released 3 EPs with techno artist and fellow Cabbage Head alumni Cristian Vogel, under the band name \\"Inevitable Technology\\". The pair later founded a record company, Mosquito, in 1997. During this time, Begg assembled a recording studio (which is now located in Harrow, in northwest London), and learned about A&R; and label management. He moved to London in the 1990s, where he met Jonathan More and Matt Black of Coldcut through the local music scene. Begg's works as Cabbage Boy were subsequently released on their Ninja Tune sub-label, Ntone. Begg released his solo debut album Commuter World on Caipirinha Productions in 1998. He continued to release 12\\" singles on a variety of small independent record labels (including his own). In 2001, he released The Mission Statement on the Mute Records subsidiary Novamute, going by the name of as S. I. Futures. This was followed by another Si Begg album, Director's Cut (2003) Since 2005, he has also released mp3 files on Digital Distortions and further singles on another label that he founded himself, Noodles Recordings and its sub-labels, Noodles Institute of Technology and Noodles Discothèque, which he called \\"the stupidest recording organisation in the world\\". The description comes from the fact that the label releases such a wide variety of musical styles, a tactic most labels would avoid. In addition to working as a recording artist, he also performs live DJ sets throughout Europe. He currently has two DJ residencies in London, Big Beat Boutique at Scala and Freakin the Frame at The End. He has also worked as a remixer for over 40 different electronic artists including Alloy Mental, Atmosfear, DJ Rush, Faultline, Michael Forshaw, Lamb, Little Nobody, Moguai, Radio 4, Tipper, Sven Väth, Cristian Vogel, Jennifer Delano, Neuflex, Jason Sparks, Bolz Bolz and Stewart Walker. Begg's compositions have been featured in films, TV shows and trailers, including Ad Astra (film), A Quiet Place Part II, The Outsider (2018 film) and The Two Popes, all placed by Elephant Music. Pseudonyms and collaborations Begg has recorded under variety of names, both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other artists. He explains that it is a \\"necessity because of the way the industry kind of works. Because a lot of people want exclusive names and there's just no way I could. If there was one label that I felt was my home and I didn't want to do stuff for other labels then that would be fine, but no single label is willing to release my full output – my full kind of range.

As of 2013 its population was of 5,464. Geography It is situated in the extreme east of Germany, 70 km (40 miles) east of Berlin, 16 km (10 miles) west of the boundary with Poland. History Church in Seelow The village appears in the records held in 1252 by Archbishop Wilbrand of Magdeburg. At that time, listed as Villa Zelou, it was included in the property of the formerly Polish Bishopric of Lebus (Lubusz Land), contested between the Magdeburg archbishops and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. Seelow suffered damaging town fires in 1630, 1788 and again in 1809. From 1816 Seelow was included for administrative purposes in the , a subdivision of the Frankfurt Region within the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In 1863 the district council office was relocated to Seelow and in 1950 \\"Lebus district\\" was renamed \\"Seelow district\\"; following frontier changes agreed with the Soviet Union in 1945, the town of Lebus itself had lost to Poland much of the agricultural area that had traditionally supported it. Between 1952 and 1993, Seelow was the administrative centre for the within the larger Frankfurt territory. Seelow was the location of one of the last major pitched battles in Europe during the Second World War - the Battle of the Seelow Heights. In this battle, from 16 to 19 April 1945, Soviet troops under Marshal Zhukov opened the way to Berlin. By the time the slaughter was over the town was largely destroyed, primarily through a major air attack which took place on 17 April 1945, and which was followed by extensive burning and plunder. Cultural references Because of its importance in the Second World War, Seelow is today featured in many video games, books and films. Seelow is a playable map in the popular PS3 and Xbox 360 game Call of Duty: World at War. The Battle of the Seelow Heights is featured extensively in Men of War. The planet Тзаэло (Tzaelow) in the Warhammer 40,000 universe is a likely reference to the town of Seelow, particularly the way that the battle is fought.

High voltage electricity refers to electric potential large enough to cause injury or damage. In certain industries, high voltage refers to voltage above a certain threshold. Equipment and conductors that carry high voltage warrant special safety requirements and procedures. High voltage is used in electrical power distribution, in cathode ray tubes, to generate X-rays and particle beams, to produce electrical arcs, for ignition, in photomultiplier tubes, and in high-power amplifier vacuum tubes, as well as other industrial, military and scientific applications.  Definition  The numerical definition of depends on context. Two factors considered in classifying a voltage as high voltage are the possibility of causing a spark in air, and the danger of electric shock by contact or proximity. The International Electrotechnical Commission and its national counterparts (IET, IEEE, VDE, etc.) define high voltage as above 1000 V for alternating current, and at least 1500 V for direct current. In the United States, the National Electrical Manufacturer's Association (NEMA) defines high voltage as over 100 to 230 kV. British Standard BS 7671:2008 defines high voltage as any voltage difference between conductors that is higher than 1000 VAC or 1500 V ripple-free DC, or any voltage difference between a conductor and Earth that is higher than 600 VAC or 900 V ripple-free DC. Electricians may only be licensed for particular voltage classes in some jurisdictions.One such jurisdiction is Manitoba, where the Electrician's Licence Act, CCSM E50 establishes classes of electrician's licences by voltage. For example, an electrical license for a specialized sub- trade such as installation of HVAC systems, fire alarm systems, closed circuit television systems may be authorized to install systems energized up to only 30 volts between conductors, and may not be permitted to work on mains-voltage circuits. The general public may consider household mains circuits (100 to 250 VAC), which carry the highest voltages they normally encounter, to be high voltage. Voltages over approximately 50 volts can usually cause dangerous amounts of current to flow through a human being who touches two points of a circuit, so safety standards are more restrictive around such circuits. In automotive engineering, high voltage is defined as voltage in range 30 to 1000 VAC or 60 to 1500 VDC.UNECE regulation No 100 (revision 2, 12 August 2013), paragraph 2.17 http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2013/R100r2e.pdf The definition of extra-high voltage (EHV) again depends on context. In electric power transmission engineering, EHV is classified as voltages in the range of 345,000– 765,000 V. In electronics systems, a power supply that provides greater than 275,000 volts is called an EHV Power Supply, and is often used in experiments in physics. The accelerating voltage for a television cathode ray tube may be described as extra-high voltage or extra- high tension (EHT), compared to other voltage supplies within the equipment. This type of supply ranges from 5 kV to about 30 kV.  Production  The common static electric sparks seen under low-humidity conditions always involve voltage well above 700 V. For example, sparks to car doors in winter can involve voltages as high as 20,000 V. Electrostatic generators such as Van de Graaff generators and Wimshurst machines can produce voltages approaching one million volts, but typically produce low currents. Induction coils operate on the flyback effect resulting in voltages greater than the turns ratio multiplied by the input voltage. They typically produce higher currents than electrostatic machines, but each doubling of desired output voltage roughly doubles the weight due to the amount of wire required in the secondary winding. Thus scaling them to higher voltages by adding more turns of wire can become impractical. The Cockcroft-Walton multiplier can be used to multiply the voltage produced by an induction coil. It generates DC using diode switches to charge a ladder of capacitors. Tesla coils utilize resonance, are lightweight, and do not require semiconductors. The largest scale sparks are those produced naturally by lightning. An average bolt of negative lightning carries a current of 30 to 50 kiloamperes, transfers a charge of 5 coulombs, and dissipates 500 megajoules of energy (120 kg TNT equivalent, or enough to light a 100-watt light bulb for approximately 2 months). However, an average bolt of positive lightning (from the top of a thunderstorm) may carry a current of 300 to 500 kiloamperes, transfer a charge of up to 300 coulombs, have a potential difference up to 1 gigavolt (a billion volts), and may dissipate 300 GJ of energy (72 tons TNT, or enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb for up to 95 years). A negative lightning strike typically lasts for only tens of microseconds, but multiple strikes are common. A positive lightning stroke is typically a single event. However, the larger peak current may flow for hundreds of milliseconds, making it considerably more energetic than negative lightning.  Sparks in air  Long exposure photograph of a Tesla coil showing the repeated electric discharges The dielectric breakdown strength of dry air, at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), between spherical electrodes is approximately 33 kV/cm.A. H. Howatson, \\"An Introduction to Gas Discharges\\", Pergamom Press, Oxford, 1965, page 67 This is only as a rough guide, since the actual breakdown voltage is highly dependent upon the electrode shape and size. Strong electric fields (from high voltages applied to small or pointed conductors) often produce violet-colored corona discharges in air, as well as visible sparks. Voltages below about 500–700 volts cannot produce easily visible sparks or glows in air at atmospheric pressure, so by this rule these voltages are \\"low\\". However, under conditions of low atmospheric pressure (such as in high-altitude aircraft), or in an environment of noble gas such as argon or neon, sparks appear at much lower voltages. 500 to 700 volts is not a fixed minimum for producing spark breakdown, but it is a rule-of-thumb. For air at STP, the minimum sparkover voltage is around 327 volts, as noted by Friedrich Paschen. While lower voltages do not, in general, jump a gap that is present before the voltage is applied, interrupting an existing current flow with a gap often produces a low-voltage spark or arc. As the contacts are separated, a few small points of contact become the last to separate. The current becomes constricted to these small hot spots, causing them to become incandescent, so that they emit electrons (through thermionic emission). Even a small 9 V battery can spark noticeably by this mechanism in a darkened room. The ionized air and metal vapour (from the contacts) form plasma, which temporarily bridges the widening gap. If the power supply and load allow sufficient current to flow, a self- sustaining arc may form. Once formed, an arc may be extended to a significant length before breaking the circuit. Attempting to open an inductive circuit often forms an arc, since the inductance provides a high-voltage pulse whenever the current is interrupted. AC systems make sustained arcing somewhat less likely, since the current returns to zero twice per cycle. The arc is extinguished every time the current goes through a zero crossing, and must reignite during the next half-cycle to maintain the arc. Unlike an ohmic conductor, the resistance of an arc decreases as the current increases. This makes unintentional arcs in an electrical apparatus dangerous since even a small arc can grow large enough to damage equipment and start fires if sufficient current is available. Intentionally produced arcs, such as used in lighting or welding, require some element in the circuit to stabilize the arc's current/voltage characteristics.  Uses  = Distribution = Power lines with high voltage warning sign. Electrical transmission and distribution lines for electric power typically use voltages between tens and hundreds of kilovolts. The lines may be overhead or underground. High voltage is used in power distribution to reduce ohmic losses when transporting electricity long distance. = Industrial = It is used in the production of semiconductors to sputter thin layers of metal films on the surface of the wafer. It is also used for electrostatic flocking to coat objects with small fibers that stand on edge. = Scientific = Spark gaps were used historically as an early form of radio transmission. Similarly, lightning discharges in the atmosphere of Jupiter are thought to be the source of the planet's powerful radio frequency emissions.K. Rinnert et al., Measurements of radio frequency signals from lightning in Jupiter's atmosphere, J. Geophys. Res., 103(E10) High voltages have been used in landmark chemistry and particle physics experiments and discoveries. Electric arcs were used in the isolation and discovery of the element argon from atmospheric air. Induction coils powered early X-ray tubes. Moseley used an X-ray tube to determine the atomic number of a selection of metallic elements by the spectrum emitted when used as anodes. High voltage is used for generating electron beams for microscopy. Cockcroft and Walton invented the voltage multiplier to transmutate lithium atoms in lithium oxide into helium by accelerating hydrogen atoms.  Safety  International safety symbol: \\"Caution, risk of electric shock\\" (ISO 7010 W012), also known as high voltage symbol Voltages greater than 50 V applied across dry unbroken human skin can cause heart fibrillation if they produce electric currents in body tissues that happen to pass through the chest area. The voltage at which there is the danger of electrocution depends on the electrical conductivity of dry human skin. Living human tissue can be protected from damage by the insulating characteristics of dry skin up to around 50 volts. If the same skin becomes wet, if there are wounds, or if the voltage is applied to electrodes that penetrate the skin, then even voltage sources below 40 V can be lethal. Accidental contact with any high voltage supplying sufficient energy may result in severe injury or death. This can occur as a person's body provides a path for current flow, causing tissue damage and heart failure. Other injuries can include burns from the arc generated by the accidental contact. These burns can be especially dangerous if the victim's airway is affected. Injuries may also be suffered as a result of the physical forces experienced by people who fall from a great height or are thrown a considerable distance. Low-energy exposure to high voltage may be harmless, such as the spark produced in a dry climate when touching a doorknob after walking across a carpeted floor. The voltage can be in the thousand-volt range, but the average current is low. The standard precautions to avoid injury include working under conditions that would avoid having electrical energy flow through the body, particularly through the heart region, such as between the arms, or between an arm and a leg. Electricity can flow between two conductors in high voltage equipment and the body can complete the circuit. To avoid that from happening, the worker should wear insulating clothing such as rubber gloves, use insulated tools, and avoid touching the equipment with more than one hand at a time. An electrical current can also flow between the equipment and the earth ground. To prevent that, the worker should stand on an insulated surface such as on rubber mats. Safety equipment is tested regularly to ensure it is still protecting the user. Test regulations vary according to country. Testing companies can test at up 300,000 volts and offer services from glove testing to Elevated Working Platform (or EWP) testing. = Distribution = Contact with or close approach to line conductors presents a danger of electrocution. Contact with overhead wires can result in injury or death. Metal ladders, farm equipment, boat masts, construction machinery, aerial antennas, and similar objects are frequently involved in fatal contact with overhead wires. Unauthorized persons climbing on power pylons or electrical apparatus are also frequently the victims of electrocution.National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation: Cases of high- voltage related casualties . Retrieved on 24 November 2008. At very high transmission voltages even a close approach can be hazardous, since the high voltage may arc across a significant air gap. Digging into a buried cable can also be dangerous to workers at an excavation site. Digging equipment (either hand tools or machine driven) that contacts a buried cable may energize piping or the ground in the area, resulting in electrocution of nearby workers. A fault in a high-voltage transmission line or substation may result in high currents flowing along the surface of the earth, producing an earth potential rise that also presents a danger of electric shock. For high voltage and extra-high voltage transmission lines, specially trained personnel use \\"live line\\" techniques to allow hands-on contact with energized equipment. In this case the worker is electrically connected to the high-voltage line but thoroughly insulated from the earth so that he is at the same electrical potential as that of the line. Since training for such operations is lengthy, and still presents a danger to personnel, only very important transmission lines are subject to maintenance while live. Outside these properly engineered situations, insulation from earth does not guarantee that no current flows to earth—as grounding or arcing to ground can occur in unexpected ways, and high- frequency currents can burn even an ungrounded person. Touching a transmitting antenna is dangerous for this reason, and a high-frequency Tesla coil can sustain a spark with only one endpoint. Protective equipment on high-voltage transmission lines normally prevents formation of an unwanted arc, or ensures that it is quenched within tens of milliseconds. Electrical apparatus that interrupts high-voltage circuits is designed to safely direct the resulting arc so that it dissipates without damage. High voltage circuit breakers often use a blast of high pressure air, a special dielectric gas (such as SF6 under pressure), or immersion in mineral oil to quench the arc when the high voltage circuit is broken. Wiring in equipment such as X-ray machines and lasers requires care. The high voltage section is kept physically distant from the low voltage side to reduce the possibility of an arc forming between the two. To avoid coronal losses, conductors are kept as short as possible and free of sharp points. If insulated, the plastic coating should be free of air bubbles which result in coronal discharges within the bubbles. = Electrostatic generators = A high voltage is not necessarily dangerous if it cannot deliver substantial current. Despite electrostatic machines such as Van de Graaff generators and Wimshurst machines producing voltages approaching one million volts, they deliver a brief sting. That is because the current is low, e.g. only a relatively few electrons move. These devices have a limited amount of stored energy, so the average current produced is low and usually for a short time, with impulses peaking in the 1 A range for a nanosecond.EDN - Understanding and comparing the differences in ESD testing The discharge may involve extremely high voltage over very short periods, but to produce heart fibrillation, an electric power supply must produce a significant current in the heart muscle continuing for many milliseconds, and must deposit a total energy in the range of at least millijoules or higher. Relatively high current at anything more than about fifty volts can therefore be medically significant and potentially fatal. During the discharge, these machines apply high voltage to the body for only a millionth of a second or less. So a low current is applied for a very short time, and the number of electrons involved is very small. = Tesla coils = Despite Tesla coils superficially appearing similar to Van de Graaff generators, they are not electrostatic machines and can produce significant radio frequency currents continuously. The current supplied to a human body will be relatively constant as long as contact is maintained, unlike with electrostatic machines which generally take longer to build up charges, and the voltage will be much higher than the break-down voltage of human skin. As a consequence, the output of a Tesla coil can be dangerous or even fatal. = Arc flash hazard = thumb High voltage testing arrangement with large capacitor and test transformer Depending on the prospective short-circuit current available at a switchgear line-up, a hazard is presented to maintenance and operating personnel due to the possibility of a high-intensity electric arc. Maximum temperature of an arc can exceed 10,000 kelvins, and the radiant heat, expanding hot air, and explosive vaporization of metal and insulation material can cause severe injury to unprotected workers. Such switchgear line-ups and high-energy arc sources are commonly present in electric power utility substations and generating stations, industrial plants and large commercial buildings. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association, has published a guideline standard NFPA 70E for evaluating and calculating arc flash hazard, and provides standards for the protective clothing required for electrical workers exposed to such hazards in the workplace. = Explosion hazard = Even voltages insufficient to break down air can supply enough energy to ignite atmospheres containing flammable gases or vapours, or suspended dust. For example, hydrogen gas, natural gas, or petrol/gasoline vapor mixed with air can be ignited by sparks produced by electrical apparatus. Examples of industrial facilities with hazardous areas are petrochemical refineries, chemical plants, grain elevators, and coal mines. Measures taken to prevent such explosions include: * Intrinsic safety by the use of apparatus designed not to accumulate enough stored electrical energy to trigger an explosion * Increased safety, which applies to devices using measures such as oil-filled enclosures to prevent sparks * Explosion-proof (flame-proof) enclosures, which are designed so that an explosion within the enclosure cannot escape and ignite a surrounding explosive atmosphere (this designation does not imply that the apparatus can survive an internal or external explosion) In recent years, standards for explosion hazard protection have become more uniform between European and North American practice. The \\"zone\\" system of classification is now used in modified form in U.S. National Electrical Code and in the Canadian Electrical Code. Intrinsic safety apparatus is now approved for use in North American applications. = Toxic gases = Electrical discharges, including partial discharge and corona, can produce small quantities of toxic gases, which in a confined space can be a health hazard. These gases include oxidizers such as ozone and various oxides of nitrogen. They are readily identified by their characteristic odor or color, and thus contact time can be minimized. Nitric oxide is invisible but has a sweet odor. It oxidizes to nitrogen dioxide within a few minutes, which has a yellow or reddish-brown color depending on concentration and smells of chlorine gas like a swimming pool. Ozone is invisible but has a pungent smell like that of the air after a lightning storm. It is a short-lived species and half of it breaks down into within a day at normal temperatures and atmospheric pressure. = Lightning = Hazards due to lightning obviously include a direct strike on persons or property. However, lightning can also create dangerous voltage gradients in the earth, as well as an electromagnetic pulse, and can charge extended metal objects such as telephone cables, fences, and pipelines to dangerous voltages that can be carried many miles from the site of the strike. Although many of these objects are not normally conductive, very high voltage can cause the electrical breakdown of such insulators, causing them to act as conductors. These transferred potentials are dangerous to people, livestock, and electronic apparatus. Lightning strikes also start fires and explosions, which result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage. For example, each year in North America, thousands of forest fires are started by lightning strikes. Measures to control lightning can mitigate the hazard; these include lightning rods, shielding wires, and bonding of electrical and structural parts of buildings to form a continuous enclosure.

He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates in and from through . Blass was one of the National League's top pitchers between 1968 and 1972, helping the Pirates win four National League Eastern Division titles in five years between and . He played a key role in the Pirates victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 World Series when he recorded two complete game victories. He remains the last National League pitcher to throw a complete game in Game Seven of a World Series. After his playing career ended, Blass had a 34-year career as a television sports commentator for Pittsburgh Pirates games. Playing career Blass was born in Canaan, Connecticut. Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960, he made his major league debut at the age of 22 in 1964 and joined the team permanently in 1966. He won 18 games in 1968, including a 2.12 ERA with seven shutouts, both career highs, and he finished particularly strong, winning the NL Player of the Month award for September with a 5-1 record, 1.65 ERA, and 46 SO. In 1969 he won 16 games with a career-high 147 strikeouts. From 1969 to 1972 he won 60 games, with a career-high 19 victories in 1972. In that season, he was a member of the National League team in the 1972 All-Star Game and was the runner up to Steve Carlton for the National League Cy Young Award. In the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Blass pitched two complete game wins, allowing only seven hits and two runs in 18 innings, and was the winning pitcher in the 7th and deciding game. He finished second in the voting for World Series MVP behind teammate Roberto Clemente. In a ten-season major league career, Blass posted a 103–76 record with 896 strikeouts and a 3.63 ERA in 1,597 innings pitched, including 16 shutouts and 57 complete games. \\"Steve Blass disease\\" Besides his Series performance, Blass is best known for his sudden and inexplicable loss of control after the 1972 season. His ERA climbed to 9.85 in the 1973 season, during which he walked 84 batters in innings, and struck out only 27. After spending most of 1974 in the minor leagues, he retired from baseball in March 1975. Two months later writer Roger Angell chronicled Blass's travails in an essay in The New Yorker. A condition referred to as \\"Steve Blass disease\\" has become a part of baseball lexicon. The \\"diagnosis\\" is applied to talented players who inexplicably and permanently seem to lose their ability to throw a baseball accurately.Steve Blass, Cured  The BASEBALL Page The fielder's variant of \\"Steve Blass disease\\" is sometimes referred to in baseball terminology as \\"Steve Sax syndrome\\". Notable victims of \\"Steve Blass disease\\" include Rick Ankiel,ESPN.com - Ankiel can't seem to conquer 'The Creature' ESPN.com, June 16, 2003 Mark Wohlers, Dontrelle Willis, Ricky Romero, and Daniel Bard. In an interview years later, Blass mentioned that he was content with how his career panned out, mentioning that he had gotten ten good years with the Pirates, won 100 games, and appeared in a World Series. He did mention that the sudden death of teammate and close friend Roberto Clemente in the offseason before he lost control – and the associated grief related to suddenly losing someone so close – did not play a factor in him losing his control. In pop culture In House, MD season three, episode 21, Dr. Gregory House thinks that Dr. Eric Foreman has gotten the Yips from killing a patient in the previous episode. He briefly explains the condition and says that Dr. Foreman has lost his confidence. In his explanation he mentions, by name, Pittsburgh Pirates’ World Series champion Steve Blass as having suffered the condition. The Season 5 episode of Northern Exposure “Blood Ties” features an explicit reference to Blass during a discussion of Dr. Joel Fleischman’s sudden inability to hit a vein while attempting to draw blood. In season 1 of Prison Playbook episode 14, the main character, Kim Je-hyuk, is attributed with having Steve Blass disease when trying to make his comeback in baseball. Another reference is made to a golfer who suddenly got the Yips. Post-playing career Blass worked in the late 1970s as a salesman for a Pittsburgh company that manufactured school class rings. He joined the Pirates' TV and radio broadcast team in 1983 as a part-time color commentator, earning a full-time post in 1986. Before the 2005 season, he announced that he would announce only home games from then on to spend more time with his family. Blass retired from broadcasting in 2019 after 60 years with the organization as a player and broadcaster. He was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. Blass' autobiography, A Pirate For Life (Triumph Books), was released on May 1, 2012. His memoirs, co-written with Erik Sherman, encompass his struggles with Steve Blass disease and his days as a color commentator for the Pirates. On September 28, 2019, Blass was inducted as an inaugural member into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall Of Fame.

Orthacanthus lived in marine environments and had a nektobenthic life habitat, with a carnivorous diet. Multiple sources have also discovered evidence of cannibalism in the diet of Orthacanthus and of \\"filial cannibalism\\" where adult Orthacanthus preyed upon juvenile Orthacanthus. The genus Orthacanthus has been synonymized with Dittodus (Owen, 1867), Didymodus (Cope, 1883), and Diplodus (Agassiz, 1843). About 260 million years ago, Orthacanthus was the apex predator of freshwater swamps and bayous in Europe and North America. Mature Orthacanthus reached nearly 3 meters (10 feet) in length. Orthacanthus teeth have a minimum of three cusps, two principal cusps, and an intermediate cusp, where the principal cusps are variously serrated, with complex base morphology. Additionally, Orthacanthus can be diagnosed by major transverse axes of proximal ends at a 45 degree angle to and often almost parallel to the labial margin of the base between the cusps. Deformed teeth are characteristic of the xenacanth sharks and of Orthacanthus.  Description and Paleobiology  = Teeth = A tricuspid Orthacanthus tooth from Bolsovian shale at Whitehaven, Cumbria, England . Found by K & C Paxton The larger teeth of Orthacanthus compressus and Orthacanthus texensis are differentiated by a more pronounced basal tubercle in O. compressus. The basal tubercle of a typical tooth file is on the apical button of the underlying tooth. The larger adult teeth of O. compressus have a wider rather than longer base, similar to O. texensis, and tend to have serrations on both carinae of each cusp, while the medial carinae of smaller adult teeth are not serrated. The juvenile teeth of O. compressus are longer than wide, have a thinner base, and lack serrations, similar to O. platypternus teeth. Orthacanthus platypternus from the Craddock Bonebed shark layer in Texas, USA, shows evidence of resorption, and the equivalent of an \\"enamel pearl.\\" Some of the teeth specimens found at this location show evidence of resorption, which has not been previously observed in other faunas at the same location. Where the superjacent basal tubercle is expected to be resorbed if the teeth were to undergo resorption, the apical button is resorbed instead. = Sexual Dimorphism = The difference in characteristics between the large and small O. compressus adult teeth might indicate sexual dimorphism. The spines of O. platypternus showing 3 to 4 dentine layers are interpreted to be subadults or young adults, and are separated into two size classes where females have the largest spines in comparison to males, indicating sexual dimorphism. = Dorsal Spine, Dentine, and Denticles = The dorsal spines of Orthacanthus platypternus from the Craddock Bone Bed in Texas, USA, preserve a highly vascularized wall mainly composed of centrifugally growing dentine (the outer layer of the wall of the spine) in a succession of inwardly growing dentine layers that line the pulp cavity. These dentine layers are likely deposited periodically in accordance with seasonal variations in water temperature and food availability. More specifically, the periodic nature of the dentine layer deposits could be due to variation in calcium phosphate deposition following the changes in water temperature. Spines of individuals with 1-2 dentine layers are likely juveniles and result in the smallest sizes, whereas individuals showing at least 3-4 dentine layers result in two separate size classes. The cross section is oval near the opening of the pulp cavity and circular/subtriangular in the distal part of the non-denticulated region and circular in the denticulated region. The pulp cavity of the spine is filled with calcite, quartz, and opaque minerals. = Occipital spine and denticles = Size compared to a human The spine is superficially inserted in the skin, where it grows and moves from a deep position in the dermis where trabecular dentine forms, to a superficial location where centrifugally growing lamellar dentine forms. The number of denticles per annual cycle vary with growth rate, and are independent dermal elements formed by the dermal papilla and secondarily attached by dentine to the spine proper. The density of denticulation also varies with the growth rate of the occipital spine. The ratio of length of denticulated region to total length of the spine changes throughout ontogeny.  Historical information and discovery  Genera Orthacanthus and Pleuracanthus were founded by Agassiz in 1837 on isolated \\"ichthyodorulites\\" from the British Carboniferous System, and at the time were mistakenly thought of as the first indicators of Skates. They were initially found throughout the United Kingdom in Dudley, Leeds, North Wales, Carluke, and Edinburh. Three additional species from the Carboniferous formation of Ohio were described by Dr. Newberry. Teeth associated with Diplodus, a genus of sharks, was found in the Carboniferous slates of England in Stafford, Carluke, and Burdiehouse, and in Nova Scotia. A well preserved impression fromm Ruppelsdorf, Bohemia was described by Goldfuss, while a separate paper published the same specimen under the name Xenacanthus Dechenii. One year later in 1849, Dr. Jordan mistakenly identified the same specimen as the remains of a fossil shark Triodus sessilis. This mistake was corrected and identified as Xenacanthus by Mr. Schnur. = Classification = Orthacanthus teeth Skull The teeth of Orthacanthus texensis and Orthacanthus platypternus from bonebeds from the Lower Permian of Texas, and the teeth of Orthacanthus compressus from the Upper Pennsylvanian of Nebraska and Dunkard Basin of the central Appalachians were used to determine the origin of O. texensis and O. platypternus. It has been proposed that both O. texensis and O. platypternus could be derived from O. compressus, where juvenile features of O. compressus are retained in the adult teeth of O. platypternus via paedomorphosis, and the juvenile features of O. compressus teeth are observed in the adult teeth of O. texensis. Taxon Mimia sits outside of a clade that contains two monophyletic sister groups. The first monophyletic sister group defines a clade that includes the stem-group chondrichthyans which is visualized as a sister group of Doliodus and a large clade that comprises the cladodont sharks and Orthacanthus. The “cladodont sharks” plus Orthacanthus comprise two monophyletic sister groups: Orthacanthus and the Cladodoides and Tamiobatis on one side, and the Symmoriiformes on the other side. The second monophyletic sister group characterizes crown chondrichthyans which contains two monophyletic sister groups (Euchondrocephali on one side and Euselachii on the other side). = Cladistic Analysis= Paleobiology Restoration of O. senckenbergianus A 2013 analysis of oxygen and strontium isotope composition of the teeth and spines of Late Carboniferous and Early Permian shark taxa was performed to infer the hydrochemistry of their ambient water, thus contributing to the controversy between an obligate freshwater or euryhaline diadromous lifestyle. Facies interpretations in the Permian of North America suggested that salinity tolerance of xenacanthids was restricted to near marine environments while only Orthacanthus can tolerate brackish water environments. A study covering the morphology and histology of dorsal spines of Orthacanthus platypternus also reported that \\"The comparative analyses of the ontogenetic stages of the recorded specimens of O. platypternus and their distribution along different facies and localities indicate that this species was euryhaline, diadromous with a catadromous life-cycle which was strongly regulated by the semi-arid, seasonally dry tropical climate affecting western Pangaea during the Early Permian.\\" The 2013 analysis provided evidence leaning towards an obligate freshwater lifestyle of the sharks from the studied Variscan European basins, and nonmarine ratios suggested teeth formation was influence by meteoric waves enriched by evaporation. Euryhaline adaptation was not confirmed in the 2013 analysis. = Predator-Prey relationship = Orthacanthus and Triodus have a predator-prey relationship where specifically there is predation of Orthacanthus on Triodus. Cranial remains of specimens of both Orthacanthus and Triodus were from the Upper Carboniferous in Puertollano basin, Spain, and give evidence of this predator-prey relationship. Numerous and well preserved cephalic elements of Triodus were associated with the cranial remains of Orthacanthus, and is explained by the inclusion of occipital spines of Triodus in the buccal cavity of Orthacanthus. Additional evidence is the co-occurrence of one Orthacanthus spine with many Triodus spines, which likely penetrated the soft tissue and cartilage of the mouth of Orthacanthus, similarly to modern sharks that feed on stingrays where the spines of stingrays have been found within and around the buccal cavities of Carcharhinus, Galeocerdo, Negaprion and Sphyrna. Examination of Orthacanthus coprolites from Canada by Aodhan O' Gogain et al revealed that in times of hardship, Orthacanthus was likely cannibalistic, as teeth from juvenile Orthacanthus were found within the coprolites of adults. Orthacanthus had a catholic diet that consisted of actinopterygians, acanthodians, dipnoans, xenacanthids and tetrapods, based on analysis of coprolites and gut contents. There have also been suspicions of filial cannibalism due to the presence of juvenile Orthacanthus teeth inside an Orthacanthus coprolite. The poop of Orthacanthus has a unique spiraling shape due to a corkscrew-shaped rectum.  Paleoecology  O. senckenbergianus The palaeobiogeographical distribution of O. platypternus suggests ontogenetic habitat partitioning. Ontogenetic niche theory predicts that individuals may change their habitat or diet to maintain optimal growth rates or to improve trade-offs between mortality risk and growth. While smaller individuals likely lived in shallower waters such as in small ponds and stream channels of the coastal plain, larger individuals likely lived in deeper water such as the fluvio-lacustrine (rivers and lakes) and marginal marine areas. The oldest known specimen of Orthacanthus, Diplodus problematicus was found in New Brunswick, Canada, from the Emsian, ranging between 407 and 393 million years ago. Other specimens have been found in locations including the US, the United Kingdom, Poland, and France.

The NSWPP had been the American Nazi Party until shortly after the assassination of leader George Lincoln Rockwell in 1967. Collin, a follower of Rockwell, developed differences with his successor Matt Koehl. The party's headquarters were in Chicago's Marquette Park, and its main activity in the early 1970s was organizing loud demonstrations against Black people moving into previously all-white neighborhoods. The marches and community reaction led the city of Chicago to ban all demonstrations in Marquette Park unless they paid an insurance fee of $250,000. While challenging the city's actions in the courts, the party decided to redirect its attention to Chicago's suburbs, which had no such restrictions. Skokie controversy In 1977 Collin announced the party's intention to march through the largely Jewish community of Skokie, Illinois, where one in six residents was a Holocaust survivor. A legal battle ensued when the village attempted to ban the event, and the party, represented by a Jewish ACLU lawyer in court, won the right to march on First Amendment grounds in National Socialist Party v. Village of Skokie, a lawsuit carried all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, though it failed to carry through its intention (at the last minute, Chicago relented and they marched there instead).

Henry is also noted for his contributions in development of the first steam engines. Biography William Henry was born near Downingtown, Pennsylvania to a family of Scots-Irish extraction. Prior to his service in the Continental Congress, Henry was a gunsmith and provided rifles to the British during the French and Indian War: Henry himself, serving as armorer, accompanied troops on John Forbes's successful mission to retake Fort Duquesne in 1758. By 1760, according to Scott Paul Gordon, Henry had largely abandoned his occupation of gunsmith and had become a successful ironmonger and merchant in Lancaster.see Scott Paul Gordon, \\"The Ambitions of William Henry,\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 136, no. 3 (2012): 253-284. Henry later served in many positions of public responsibility, including Assistant Commissary General to the Continental Army for the district of Lancaster and, in 1779, Commissary of Hides for Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. In these positions, Henry managed vast sums of money and acquired and transferred enormous amounts of material. (He was no longer producing guns, but he did acquire them—along with shoes, hats, flour—to supply them to state and continental troops.) In 1780 Henry informed Joseph Reed that he had \\"laid out…between Sixty & Seventy Thousand Pound\\" just to \\"purchase Leather and Paying Workmens Wages at the Shoe-Factory[s]\\" he had established \\"at Philadelphia, Allentown and Lancaster.\\"William Henry to Joseph Reed (April 25, 1780), quoted in Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., \\"William Henry (1729–1786),\\" in Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society, Volume One: 1743-1768 (Philadelphia, 1997), 349-61 (quotation, 356). His correspondence is filled with letters from Army leaders, including George Washington, begging for arms and other materials. Henry was the Treasurer of Lancaster Country for many years, a position filled by his wife, Ann Wood Henry, after Henry's death in 1786. Henry was an intellectual who helped found Lancaster's Juliana Library-Company in 1759, which during the Revolution and after was housed in his residence, and he held membership in the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, whose first Transactions (1771) printed Henry's account of his invention of a \\"Description of a Self-Moving or Sentinel Register\\" to regulate the flue of a furnace. Henry invented a screw auger, manufactured and sold exclusively at his Lancaster store, and some credit him with inventing the steamboat: the twelve-year-old Robert Fulton, a Lancaster neighbor, visited Henry in 1777, who had been experimenting since 1763 on boats with steam engines on the Conestoga River (Fulton's own experiments began only in 1786 in England). Henry and his family were members of the Moravian Congregation at Lancaster. Henry was the earliest patron of painter Benjamin West, who lodged in Henry's home in Lancaster in 1756 and painted portraits of William and Ann Henry, probably shortly after their marriage. More significantly, Henry encouraged West to paint The Death of Socrates (1756), perhaps the first history painting produced in the colonies;Scott Paul Gordon, \\"Martial Art: Benjamin West's Death of Socrates, Colonial Politics, and the Puzzles of Patronage.\\" William and Mary Quarterly 65, 1 (2008): 65-100. West credited Henry with having initiated the painter's interest in history painting, the genre for which the painter became famous. Legacy Henry's sons carried on his gun business, in Lancaster, in Philadelphia, in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and then in Boulton, PA. One of his sons, John Joseph Henry, served as a sixteen-year-old rifleman on Benedict Arnold's march on Quebec in the fall and winter of 1775 (he was captured and imprisoned for much of 1776), and later served as president judge of the second District in Pennsylvania from 1795-1811.

Door handles can be found on all types of doors including exterior doors of residential and commercial buildings, internal doors, cupboard doors and vehicle doors. There are many designs of door handle, depending on the appropriate use. A large number of handles, particularly for commercial and residential doors, incorporate latching or locking mechanisms or are manufactured to fit to standardised door locking or latching mechanisms. The most common types of door handle are the lever handle and the doorknob. Door handles can be made out of a wide variety of materials. Examples include brass, white porcelain, brown mineral, cut glass, wood, and Victorian bronze. Door handles have been in existence for at least 5000 years, and its design has evolved since, with more advanced mechanism, types, and designs made. Some door handles are arm- or foot-operated to reduce transmission of contagious illnesses. Types Pull handle thumb *The most common type of door handle is the Lever latch or Latch door handle on a backplate found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle have a latch that keeps the door shut. The door handle has only a lever handle or knob which operates this latch. Pushing the handle down rotates the spindle, operating the tubular latch mechanism inside the door, allowing it to be opened.Different Types of Door Handles Explained retrieved November 2016 This type of door handle is used on interior doors that do not require to be locked. The lever latch handle is easy to install and use, and is available in a variety of styles and finishes. The doorknob has a spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, to which the spindle is connected. Pushing the lever or turning the knob pulls the cylinder in the direction of the turn. The end of the cylinder is the \\"latch bolt\\" (more simply known as the \\"latch\\"), which protrudes into a space carved out of the door frame, and which prevents the door from being opened if the knob is not turned. A spring or similar mechanism causes the latch to return to its protruding state whenever the knob is not being turned. *The Lever lock door handle on a backplate is another type of door handle which operates similarly to the lever latch door handle.Buying Door Handles – Things You Need To Know retrieved November 2016 This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever with a keyhole cut just below it. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle, but it can also be locked with a key. This locking mechanism is used on doors which can be opened by turning the handle if not locked, but can also be locked, requiring a key to open them. *The Lever Bathroom is typically used on bathroom doors as they can be locked and unlocked easily from the inside by turning the snib, but in an emergency can be opened from the outside by fitting a coin or similar object into a slot and rotating it. This lock is fitted with a mortice sash with the attached to a 5mm spindle which passes through the door. *The Lever Privacy is functionally similar to the Lever Bathroom in that it is locked by turning a snib on the inside and can be unlocked from the outside in emergencies. Unlike the Lever Bathroom, there is no mortice sash; locking is achieved by jamming the lever in a closed position.Master of Unlocking: The Different Types of Door Handles retrieved November 2016 * Pull door handles or simply Pull handles are U-shaped, and are used especially in the kitchen but also for drawers. Usually made of stainless steel.  History  Door handles have been in existence at least since the Neolithic period http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/10/22/switzerland.ancient.door/index.html. Locking or latching mechanisms have existed from about the same time. Key operated door locks have existed at least since Egyptian civilisation. The keys of these locks, which could be as large as two feet long, also functioned as door handles to slide a locking bolt and open the door. . Subsequently Roman domuses and insulae incorporated lockable doors of a different design but also opened by a combined handle/key.https://www.historicallocks.com/en/site/h/other-locks/19-keys-and- locks-from-imperial-rome/roman-door-locks Although available, these key lockable doors were relatively rare. Houses were almost always occupied so most lockable doors would feature a sliding bolt or a drop-in bar that allowed the building to be locked from the inside. The bolt or bar bracket acted as a handle. Although interior doors were less common in Rome than in modern buildings, the Romans had recognisably modern interior doors including door handles.https://pompeiitc.weebly.com/domus.html Doors excavated from Lake Nemi and dated to around 1st Century CE feature knob-shaped handles.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Roman_Woodworking/b3q2WGSiUzIC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=window%20handle In Asia, China by the 4th Century CE was producing a range of automated doors, door locks and door bars.John Needham: Science and Civilisation in China There is little record of door handle development between the Fall of Rome and about 1000 CE. The oldest European doors include the Bernward Doors and the Westminster Abbey doorhttps://www.westminster-abbey.org/about-the- abbey/history/britains-oldest-door. The Bernward doors have large decorative ring-shaped handles of a type that became common on decorated doors from that period onwards. The Westminster Abbey door features a sliding bolt that can also function as a handle. From at least the Middle ages blacksmiths made drop latches which could be opened by a handle connected to the latch by a split pin passing through the door.https://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/doors/door_furniture.htm Taking the form of a ring or strip, these handles could be elaborate and decorated but were universally made of metal. It can be speculated that since the task of making door hardware fell to the blacksmith, the use of turned or carved wooden knobs was not convenient. Wooden latches are also known from this period. A finger hole could be made that allowed the user to raise the latch from the other side of the door. The finger hole would double as a grip or handle. In another common design transferred motion to open the latch was effected by a string passing through the door. In this case the door might also have a basic handle carved or turned from wood.https://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/doors/door_furniture.htm From about mid-17th Century, drop handles were increasingly replaced by forged vertical handles formed as a bracket fixed to the door at the top and bottom of the bracket.https://www.amazon.com/Wrought-Handle-Rustproof-Renovators- Supply/dp/B00AIIH7RS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords;=wrought+iron+handles&qid;=1597677822&sr;=8-1-spons&psc;=1&spLa;=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMzFZSUZEMUQ0SFkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTQ0NTE3T1pTQkFHTlVNV0NWJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMzcxMDQzVFEyR0I0VEtXVVlUJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ Vertical handles with an incorporated latch mechanism, known as Suffolk latches were developed. By the mid-18th Century, forged vertical handles were being were being replaced by cast vertical handles, including the Norfolk latch. The early 17th Century also saw metalworking of a standard that allowed mortise locks and latches and compact rim locks and latches to be made for use in the most expensive buildings.http://thisisversaillesmadame.blogspot.com/2014/09/gallery-door- handles.html These locks used a twisting motion to operate, accelerating development in decorative door knobs. The Industrial Revolution dramatically reduced the cost of lock and latch manufacture with lock designers including Barronin, Chubb and Bramah competing against each other around the end of the 18th century.http://www.historyofkeys.com/locks-history/history-of-locks/ From the 18th century, a wide variety of lever handles and knobs started to be produced, with designs determined by local aesthetic preference and technology.https://www.apollo-magazine.com/history-door-handle-designs/ Knobs could be cast, turned, brazed or spun from a variety of materials. Levers could be wrought or cast. Designs became more complicated and might include a rose or escutcheon plate. Until about 1830 door handle manufacture in the western world was almost entirely European. In 1838 the USA was importing between 80 and 95% of its door handles.https://www.oldhouseonline.com/interiors-and-decor/knobs-latches-and- levershttps://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and- technology/technology/technology-terms-and-concepts/doorknob Between 1830 and 1876, the date of the Centennial Exposition, door handle manufacture grew rapidly in the US; more than 100 patents were filed for door handle and door knob improvements in that time.https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and- technology/technology/technology-terms-and-concepts/doorknob From the early 20th Century architects and designers started to take serious interest in door handles as part of a comprehensive vision of spaces for living.https://www.apollo-magazine.com/history-door-handle-designs/ In 1927 Wittgenstein famously designed a door handle which has become a prototype for curved tubular handles since then.https://www.bauhaus-fittings.com/136/Ludwig- Wittgenstein.htm Emerson wrote of handles in his \\"The American Scholar\\" address.https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/05/24/wittgensteins-handles/ Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Antoni Gaudi all produced handle designs, many of which continue to be manufactured.https://www.apollo-magazine.com/history- door-handle-designs/ While aesthetic design, cost of manufacture and functionality remain primary drivers of door handle design, the 21st Century has seen additional considerations introduced. In particular, considerations of infection control {see section below} and accessibility have become increasingly important since around 2000. The Coronavirus pandemic has contributed to a rapid development of new handle designs including foot- operated handles and handles that can be operated by the user's forearm. = Osbourn Dorsey = Osbourn Dorsey was an inventor who is widely mis-credited with inventing the doorknob in 1878. He did not invent the doorknob and nor did he patent it; his patent was for a door prop that would hold a door open in a number of positions. The patent included a drawing of a door knob only because it was a long-established and essential part of the door used to illustrate his invention. It is not known where the misapprehension arose, or why the Dorsey patent was chosen over the many earlier patents featuring door knobs. Google searches show that the mistake was prevalent at least by 2005. The Dorsey door prop was not a long-term commercial success.  Escutcheon plates  Escutcheon plates are the keyhole covers, usually circular, through which keys pass to enter the lock body. If the door handles have a square or rectangular plate on which the handle is mounted this is called the backplate. The backplate can be plain (for use with latches), pierced for keyholes (for use with locks), or pierced and fitted with turn knobs and releases (for use with bathroom locks). The plate on the front edge of the lock where the latch bolt protrudes is called the faceplate. Usage Door handle with lock which requires a key to open. The location of the door handle along the horizontal axis on the door may vary between a few inches or centimeters away from the edge of the door to the exact center of the door, depending on local culture, decorative style or owner preference. The distance from the edge of the door to the center of the handle is called the backset. The location of the door handle along the vertical axis on the door may vary between . Door knobs can be difficult for the young and elderly to operate. For this reason door handles in most American commercial and industrial buildings and in many households are lever-operated, rather than a knob, as the lever does not require a tight grip. Levers are also beneficial on doors with narrow stile widths where the reduced backset leaves insufficient space to comfortably turn a door knob. Most household door handles use a simple mechanism with a screw- style axle (called a spindle) that has at least one flat side, which is passed through the door jigger, leaving some length exposed on each side of the door to which the handles are attached. Some handles are attached on both sides by screwing or sliding them directly onto the spindle, and then securing one or more retaining screws (set screws) through the knob perpendicular to the flat of the spindle. Handles that lose traction can frequently be repaired by replacing or adjusting the set screw, which prevents them from slipping on the spindle. Other types of handles, typically used in Europe, slide onto the spindle but are affixed only to the door itself without use of set screws. Types of household handles: * Entrance: These door handles are typically used on exterior doors, and include keyed cylinders. * Privacy: Typically used on bedrooms and bathrooms; while they are lockable (unlockable with a generic tool), they do not have keyed cylinders. * Passage: Also known as hall or closet, these do not lock and are used in hall or closet doors. * Dummy: These types are used for ball catch doors or other applications where a mechanism is not needed, but a similar aesthetic effect is desired. =Cars= Car door handles may protrude from the vehicle's exterior surface or be streamlined into the vehicle's contour. In some automobiles, especially luxury vehicles, the door handles may feature a key-less entry pad utilizing either a numerical code or thumb scan. Foldables On a balcony whose door has an outside shutter, a special door handle is used on the outer side. The protruding part of such handle (usually ring-shaped) can be folded sideways, so that the shutter can be fully closed without being obstructed by the door handle. Pocket doors 90px A pocket door handle is a recessed rectangular insert, typically with operating hardware called a door pull. Door handles can also be called \\"handle sets\\". In addition there are door handles that are flush-mount and require pressing rather than turning or gripping, and there are touch- free, electronic, and motion-sensor door handles. Infection control Door handles play a role in the spread of some infections. Infection transmission can occur when an individual touches a handle and subsequently touches their eyes, nose or mouth. However, some materials, e.g. brass, copper and silver, are slowly poisonous to many germs. The exact mechanism is not known, but is commonly thought to be via the oligodynamic effect, perhaps by some other electrostatic effect. Brass and copper, for example, disinfect themselves of many door handle bacteria within eight hours. Other materials such as glass, porcelain, stainless steel and aluminium do not have this effect. 300px To avoid hand contact, some door handles are designed to be operated by the arm or foot.

A postage due stamp is a stamp added to an underpaid piece of mail to indicate the extra postage due.  Background  While the problem of what to do about letters not paying the full correct fee had existed since the creation of regular postal systems, it was greatly heightened by the advent of postage stamps, since customers were now making their own decisions about the right amount to pay, without the assistance of a presumably knowledgeable postal clerk. While at various times some countries have simply adopted the expedient of returning the letter to the sender, many others have taken the approach of delivering the letter and collecting the fee from the recipient. Initially the process was handled by a clerk writing something like \\"Due 3 cents\\" on the cover, but this was subject to abuse by mail carriers, who might write it on themselves and pocket the difference. US postage due on UK cover The problem of underpaid foreign mail was one of the issues addressed by the 1874 establishment of the Universal Postal Union. The U.P.U. arrived at the decision that mail with insufficient postage should be marked with a \\"T\\" and from April 1, 1879 the amount missing would also be indicated in black. Later more countries started to use handstamps to indicate the amount due. Later the combination of handstamps with both the \\"T\\" and the amount missing came into use. From October 1, 1907 the rules were changed. The amount to be charged instead of the amount missing would be indicated. The amount charged was usually double the amount that was missing.Centimes Due Markings Rules and Postal History Background. rootsweb 26 February 2009. Retrieved 18 August 2011.  First stamps  The problem was solved by France in 1859, with the issuance of official postage due stamps, affixed at the delivery office before being taken out to the recipients. Many other countries followed suit. (Occasionally, regular postage stamps have been used to fulfill a postage due function.) Postage due stamps (or \\"labels\\", to clarify that they have no value of their own) are not always affixed to individual letters; in the case of business mail, the total due might be summed, and the appropriate stamps added to the top letter in a bundle, or to a bundle's wrapper. The labels have also been used to collect money for other purposes, such as magazine subscriptions. Since postage due stamps are almost always used only within a single country, they are usually quite simple in design, mostly consisting of a large numeral, and an inscription saying \\"postage due\\", \\"porto\\", etc.; often there is no country name. As with definitive stamps, a variety of values are needed to make up specific amounts.  Decline in use  A number of countries have discontinued postage due stamps. Britain, which first issued theirs in 1914 (and continued the same design until 1970), ended their use in 2000. The United States terminated them in 1986, although postage meter labels were used after that date. In stamp collecting An Irish envelope with an instructional mark \\"10d To PAY\\" (186 code for Dublin) with a 10 pence postage due label affixed and tied by a datestamp While, technically, there is no reason for postage dues to reach private hands unused, postal administrations have sold them to collectors, and postage dues of many countries exist in large numbers, often unused and of low value. Conversely, surviving examples of valid postally used postage due stamps tied together by a dated cancellation or other postal markings with a postage stamp on cover are less common and are sought after by philatelists.

The CHS adopted the name, Chicago History Museum, in September 2006 for its public presence. History Much of the Chicago Historical Society's first collection was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but the museum rose from the ashes like the city. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was Abraham Lincoln's final draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in a building owned by J. Young Scammon, a prominent lawyer and member of the society. However, the building and new collection were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on its pre-1871 building-site at 632 North Dearborn Street.

Building East facade of current museum (built 1932) After 36 years in the Henry Ives Cobb structure on North Dearborn Street, the museum and library moved to the current complex in Lincoln Park. The oldest part of the museum, designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, was built in 1932 by the WPA, with the aim of creating expanded public exhibition space. The 1932 Federal-style structure has been expanded twice. The first addition, clad in limestone, opened in 1972 and was designed by Alfred Shaw and Associates. The second addition, designed by Holabird and Root, was done in 1988 and included refacing the earlier expansion in red brick to give a unified look to all three portions of the building. Both expansions occurred on the west side of the 1932 structure, leaving intact its original porticoed entrance facing Lincoln Park. The main entrance and reception hall, however, was moved to the new western addition facing Clark street. The 1988 extension, in addition to expanded exhibition galleries, also contains the museum's store and public cafe. Activities The museum explores both Chicago and American history. Exhibitions draw primarily on the museum's own collection, which numbers approximately 22 million holdings. Chicago: Crossroads of America is a 16,000-square-foot space that explores the city's development and its relationship to and influence on American history. Nearly 600 objects document the people and events of the past 200 years. Facing Freedom focuses on eight American conflicts over freedom from the 1850s to the 1970s. The Abraham Lincoln alcoves highlight the sixteenth president's election, his leadership during the Civil War, and his assassination. The adjoining Portrait Gallery features an installation on Chicago during the time of Lincoln. The Sensing Chicago exhibition invites children to use their senses to discover the past. The lobby displays various museum treasures. The newly restored dioramas are housed in the Tawani Foundation Diorama Hall. The Chicago dioramas feature Chicago's rise from a desolate frontier outpost to the bustling city that hosted the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The Chicago Room, which overlooks the plaza in Lincoln Park behind the museum building, displays a collection of stained glass. Temporary exhibitions feature objects and artifacts from the collection, covering everything from Chicago art to the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Chicagoans to the city's fashion history. On October 14, 2013, the Chicago History Museum announced a project asking the public to furnish ideas for a future exhibition and reducing the most-often-submitted ideas to one assignment through a series of public votes. According to the American Alliance of Museums, this is the first crowdsourcing project allowing the public to give an exhibition assignment to an American museum. South Side Elevated Railroad car 1. Pioneer, the first locomotive to operate in Chicago. On January 19, 2006, the first passenger car to operate on the Chicago 'L' system in 1893 was transported to its new display location at the Chicago History Museum. Passengers could ride the 1893 'L' from the Loop to Hyde Park station for 5 cents to attend the World's Columbian Exposition upon the line's opening. The vehicle, known as L Car #1, was cosmetically restored to its 1893 appearance before being transported to the museum where it was lifted into an opening created through a wall on the museum's second floor. The car's interior features include mahogany and rattan seats and etched glass windows. The L car joins the Pioneer, the first locomotive to operate in Chicago; a redesigned exhibition space to showcase the car and locomotive opened on September 30, 2006, as part of a larger remodeling project. The Museum houses Chicago's most important collection of materials related to local history. The extensive research library includes books and other published materials, manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and photos. It is open to the public, including students working on school projects. The costume collection numbers more than 50,000 pieces and dates from the 18th century to the present. It contains numerous couture pieces, items created by well-known Chicago manufacturers and designers, and garments worn by notable residents. The Museum offers a variety of programs, publications, and online resources related to Chicago and American history. This includes print and online editions of its collaborative effort the Encyclopedia of Chicago. The Museum's Chicago Fire mobile app has content equivalent to a 400-page book with more than 350 illustrations, drawn from the museum's collection. The app also offers of 10 distinct Chicago areas and 54 fire-related landmarks. The app uses GPS guidance that helps the user view photos of nearby sites from the era of the Great Chicago Fire. The Museum also publishes Chicago History magazine. Written by historians and heavily illustrated, this publication focuses on Chicago's complex past and the people who have shaped it. Additionally, more than 50,000 images from its collection have been digitized as part of Explore Chicago Collections. Every year, the Chicago History Museum recognizes important Chicagoans and Chicago organizations with its Making History Awards.

The group started as informal jam sessions with the top studio and jazz musicians of the city, but eventually began performing regularly on Monday nights at the famed venue, the Village Vanguard. In 1979, the band won a Grammy for their album Live in Munich. Like all of the musicians in the band, it was only a sideline. In 1976, he released an album titled Mel Lewis and Friends that featured him leading a smaller sextet that allowed freedom and improvisation.Mel Lewis and Friends. All Music.

He sounds like himself.\\" Lewis insisted on playing genuine Turkish-made cymbals, switching from the Zildjian Company later in his career to the Istanbul brand. His setup included a 21-inch ride on his right, a 19-inch crash-ride on his left, and his signature sound, a 22-inch swish \\"knocker\\" with rivets on his far right. The rather lightweight cymbals exuded a dark, overtone-rich sound. Lewis' wood-shell drums were considered warm and rich in their sound. He almost exclusively played a Gretsch drums set, although in later years, played Slingerland drums equipped with natural calfskin top heads. Regular mylar heads were used on the bottom. Lewis described a playing philosophy of not \\"pushing or pulling\\" but \\"supporting.\\" \\"If you watch me, it doesn't look like I'm doing much,\\" he remarked in an interview.Mel Lewis – Straight Ahead Lewis.

His father, Robert Owen, was a coal miner, while his mother belonged to the family of Thomas Edwards, poet and writer.National Library of Wales Retrieved 19 April 2017. His father and his two brothers, James and Robert, were killed on 10 May 1837 when the Argoed mine became flooded. The loss impacted heavily on the family, who remained in poverty. Owen received little formal education, but he acknowledged his debt to his Sunday School. At the age of 12, Owen was apprenticed to a tailor, Angel Jones, an Elder with the Calvinistic Methodist Church. Owen described his apprenticeship as a \\"kind of college\\", and began writing poetry after being influenced by one of his colleagues there. Owen found at the tailor's shop opportunities to discuss and argue topics with workers and customers. Early writings Owen began writing poetry under the pseudonym Glaslwyn, entering his work into local eisteddfodau and succeeding in publishing some pieces. His first significant work in Welsh was a translation of Timothy Shay Arthur's novelette Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There. This was published in a fortnightly called Charles o'r Bala. Owen then trained unsuccessfully for the ministry of his church, preaching from 1860. He enrolled in Bala Theological College in 1865, but failed to complete the course. From 1867 until the end of his life, he worked as a tailor in Mold, preaching on Sundays until prevented by illness. Thereafter his mentor, Roger Edwards, suggested that he try his hand at writing instead. Owen's first attempt at fiction was a short story, \\"Cymeriadau Methodistaidd\\" (Methodist Characters) about the election of chapel elders. Modest success with it led Edwards to encourage Owen to embark upon his first novel, Y Dreflan, which described a fictionalized version of Mold. Mature work Although Y Dreflan was popular in its time, Owen's reputation rests mainly on his three later novels, particularly Rhys Lewis and its sequel Enoc Huws. In these he again explored a fictionalized version of Mold and its Methodist chapel culture, blending comedy with satire and psychological introspection. His work is sometimes compared with that of Charles Dickens, who was a likely influence, although Owen's work is uniquely informed by his own Welsh-language culture and chapel background. List of works *Offrymau Neilltuaeth (1879) *Y Dreflan (1881) *Rhys Lewis (1885) *Y Siswrn (1886) *Enoc Huws (1891) *Gwen Tomos (1894) *Straeon y Pentan (short stories) (1895) Legacy Although not the first to write novels in Welsh, Owen is the earliest Welsh-language novelist whose works are still widely read. He is credited with starting the tradition of novel writing in the Welsh language and of influencing many later fiction writers, such as Kate Roberts and T. Rowland Hughes. Owen is commemorated in Mold by a statue and in the name of a shopping precinct and cultural centre. His name is also remembered in the Daniel Owen Memorial Prize (Gwobr Goffa Daniel Owen), awarded at the National Eisteddfod for the best unpublished novel of no less than 50,000 words with a strong story. The prize has been awarded since 1978, although if none of the entries have been deemed to be of a high enough quality, no award is presented. Mold also holds an annual cultural festival centred on the life and works of Daniel Owen called the Daniel Owen Festival.

Between 1998 and 2000 Melnychenko allegedly recorded numerous conversations that took place in Kuchma's office before fleeing abroad with the secretly taped recordings. The publication of these recordings in 2000 caused a major scandal in Ukraine (known as the Cassette Scandal), which dramatically affected the country's domestic and foreign policy. Melnychenko's principal accusations against Kuchma (supposedly confirmed by the recordings) are the ordering of the kidnapping and murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze. The United States government became involved after one of the records revealed the alleged transfer of an advanced Ukrainian radar system Kolchuha to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Hundreds of other allegations are based on the recordings. Biography Mykola Melnychenko was born in the village of Zapadynka, Kiev Oblast (now outskirt of Vasylkiv) to a family of coal miners moved from the Donbas. He graduated from the Kiev Military Institute of Control and Signals in Kiev and became a KGB communications protection expert. In 1992, soon after the collapse of Soviet Union, Melnychenko started his career in Ukraine's State Security Administration (formerly the 9th Directorate of the Committee for State Security (KGB)). Later, he joined President Leonid Kuchma's team of bodyguards and at the time of the scandal, Melnychenko held the rank of Major. His main duty was to protect the President's office against possible eavesdropping. Melnychenko is divorced with one daughter.  The 'Cassette Scandal'  On November 28, 2000, Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz publicly accused President Kuchma of involvement in the murder of Gongadze, naming Melnychenko as the source of information and playing selected recordings to journalists, starting the 'Cassette Scandal'. Days earlier Melnychenko had fled Ukraine to Ostrava in the Czech Republic, where he left several bags containing dozens of CDs storing thousands of digital recordings.Former guard implicates parliament speaker in Gongadze murder, Kyiv Post (December 3, 2009) Melnychenko left Ukraine covertly with his family, breaking an official prohibition on leaving the country. Melnychenko claimed that he acted alone when recording the President's conversations and then publishing them abroad. According to Melnychenko, he put an amateur digital dictaphone under a sofa in Kuchma's office and was changing it every time he inspected the room. As the Major states, he was motivated purely by his disillusionment with what he perceived as the extremely corrupt nature of Kuchma's regime and \\"decided to document evidences of crimes\\" committed by the President. After the disappearance of Georgiy Gongadze, he supposedly decided to publish the recordings and protect his life. Then Melnychenko turned to his political sympathizer Oleksander Moroz for help, and received it. Later, Melnychenko moved to the United States and received political asylum there. His tapes were eventually made available to the United States intelligence services and examined to determine their authenticity and content. The authenticity of the whole file of tapes remains officially unconfirmed. However, U.S. forensic experts have officially analyzed the section of tapes concerning Iraq issues and found it authentic. The Ukrainian authorities have issued an international search warrant for Melnychenko, claiming that he is an 'important witness' and possible traitor of state secrets. However, no evidence of forced return or assassination efforts against Melnychenko were made public. Many experts and journalists find Melnychenko's story highly questionable. In particular, they argue that: * It is not clear why or how exactly Melnychenko started the operation. Being a career tech agent, he has never been involved in any kind of intelligence, analysis or criminal investigation. Thus, he was unlikely to have information on the President's committing judicially proven crimes. * The means of recording described by Melnychenko seems odd, both in technical and operative terms. Indeed, it is impossible to record about 500 hours of conversations by simply changing amateur dictaphone once a day. Melnychenko's former commanding officers argue that even a very small device would be easily discovered during routine searches of the room conducted by several agents. * The original device(s) used for recording, as well as the full file of recordings, have never been presented to journalists or Ukrainian prosecutors. Besides, Melnychenko should have known that a recording copied from digital recorder will not be found authentic, making the whole idea of \\"documenting evidences\\" a nonsense. Nevertheless, experts and politicians analyzing the recordings agree that at least some of them are real, judging by known voices, speaking manners and confidential details mentioned. A few politicians, including Kuchma himself, have officially claimed they recognize their own voices on the tapes. However, the President and his supporters have always denied the authenticity of the body of conversations recorded, calling them a \\"montage\\". On the other hand, in 2002 Bruce Koenig, of the US forensic firm Bek Tek, a former worker in the FBI's forensic laboratory, examined the recordings and concluded that there were no signs of them having been doctored.Ukraine: don’t ask who killed Georgiy Gongadze, Opendemocracy.net Events following the scandal After he received asylum, Melnychenko started to become actively involved in Ukraine's politics and foreign relations, making comments for media and writing books based on his records. In 2004, Volodymyr Tsvil, a Ukrainian businessman and former KGB officer who supposedly assisted Melnychenko in his escape and further accommodation in the West, publicly accused him of not revealing certain details of the case. On March 1, 2005 the criminal case against Melnychenko for \\"the disclosure of state secrets, abuse of office and using counterfeit documents\\" was closed. Melnychenko tried to run in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election but was not registered as a candidate because he did not pay the mandatory election deposit of 2.5 million hryvnya.Eighteen to run for Ukraine's presidency, Interfax-Ukraine (November 12, 2009) On December 6, 2009 Melnychenko accused Volodymyr Lytvyn of ordering the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze in 2000. A spokesperson for Lytvyn dismissed the claims as part of the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign.Former guard accuses parliament speaker of Gongadze murder, Kyiv Post (December 8, 2009) On July 29, 2011 the criminal case against Melnychenko originally closed on March 1, 2005 was reopened. In October 2011 an arrest warrant against him was issued for \\"evading investigation and preventing the establishment of truth\\".Prosecutors: Court orders arrest of former major Melnychenko, Kyiv Post (10 November 2011) According to Ukrainian press Melnychenko was living in the United States at the time, while he claimed he was in Israel;Report: Ex-major Melnychenko is in Israel, Kyiv Post (11 November 2011) he said he lived there because \\"there was a plan to physically exterminate me\\".Melnychenko, fearing for his life, flees to United States, Kyiv Post (21 October 2011) In late March 2010 the investigation into Melnychenko was suspended because his location had not been established (Melnychenko himself claimed he was living in the United States).SBU chief:Pre-trial investigation in Melnychenko case suspended, Interfax-Ukraine (24 March 2012)PRESS:Former presidential guard Melnychenko discloses his whereabouts, Interfax-Ukraine (26 March 2012) In October 2012, Melnychenko was briefly detained and then released by the law enforcement services of Ukraine.Court orders arrest warrant for Mykola Melnychenko See also * Cassette Scandal References External links *Official personal web site only *Media publications dossiers on Melnychenko by: **Ukrayinska Pravda **LIGA **Korrespondent.net * Ukrainian Weekly articles (2003) (2002) 1966 births Living people People from Vasylkiv KGB officers Security Service of Ukraine officers Ukrainian emigrants to the United States ","title":"Mykola Melnychenko"},{"id":"1205409","text":"Charles Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough, by Joseph Nollekens, 1808, Victoria and Albert Museum Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough (8 August 1781 – 5 September 1846), styled Hon.

It is located roughly midway between Romsey and Winchester on the A3090. Besides the village the parish includes the hamlets of Standon and Pitt and the outlying settlement at Farley Chamberlayne. History Map showing Hursley dated 1607 =12th to 17th century= The earliest references to Hursley date from the late 12th century; Bishop of Winchester Henry de Blois built a manor house called Merdon Castle, within the parish, in 1138. Hursley continued in the ownership of the Bishop of Winchester until 1552 when it was surrendered to king Edward VI. The buildings had become ruinous by the 16th century, when Edward Vl granted the manor and park at Hursley to Sir Philip Hoby. Some remains, notably of a gatehouse, still stand, much overgrown, and are listed as a building at risk. During the reign of Queen Mary the manor was briefly restored to the church but given back to the Hoby family by Elizabeth I. The Hoby family sold the manor and castle to Thomas Clerke in 1600. The lodge and park at Hursley were leased separately at this time, but the two estates were brought together again in 1630 and sold in 1639 to Richard Major, High Sheriff of Hampshire for 1639–40. =The Cromwells – 1643 to 1718= The estate passed into the Cromwell family in 1643 when Oliver Cromwell's son Richard married Dorothy Major, daughter of the owner, Richard Major. Richard Cromwell lived with his wife in Hursley from 1649 until 1658 when he was proclaimed Lord Protector following the death of his father. This made Hursley briefly the country seat of the ruler of England. It was not to last however as Richard's grip on power was weak, he was forced from office within months and by 1660 concerns for his safety forced Richard Cromwell to flee the country with Dorothy. They travelled first to France and then to other parts of Europe where Richard lived under an assumed name. Richard's son Oliver Cromwell II (??-1705) took over the Hursley estate, and the tenants claimed their ancient rights and customs (including pasturage and felling trees) in a lengthy legal battle. Richard returned to Hursley after Oliver died in 1705 and lived on as lord of the manor until he died in 1712 whereupon he was buried in the chancel of All Saints' Church, Hursley. Richard's daughters sold Hursley estate to Sir William Heathcote in 1718 for £35,100. =The Heathcotes – 1718 to 1888= The Rev. William Heathcote (1772–1802), on horseback (son of the 3rd Baronet); Sir William Heathcote of Hursley, 3rd Baronet (1746–1819), holding his horse and whip; and Major Vincent Hawkins Gilbert, M.F.H., holding a Fox's mask. Daniel Gardner portrayed the three gentlemen on the hunt in 1790. Heathcote, a baronet, was a successful merchant who moved to Hursley to take up the role of a country gentleman. Between the years of 1721 and 1724 he built a red brick Queen Anne style mansion (now known as Hursley House) on the site of the original hunting lodge. William died in 1751 and the estate passed to his son, Sir Thomas Heathcote. About this time Hursley's original medieval parish church was rebuilt in a Georgian style. Sir Thomas was married twice and had eight children. When he died he was succeeded by the second Sir William. William's son, also called Sir Thomas Heathcote, was a patron of the arts and modernised Hursley House, but was blamed by later Heathcotes for property blunders that eventually cost the family the estate. William Heathcote, nephew to Thomas, became the fifth baronet in 1825. He extended Hursley House and also created Home Farm on the site of the old Merdon Castle. William was married twice, first to Caroline who bore him three sons and a daughter but died in 1835, and second to Selina in 1841 by whom he had another eight children. In 1888 Selina Heathcote sold the estate after her husband's death for £150,000 to Joseph Baxendale, the owner of Pickfords. He in turn sold it in 1902 to George Cooper, whose wife Mary was a wealthy American railways heiress. She carried out extensive development and redecoration work in 1902 to create the house that can be seen today. Sir George was created a baronet in 1905 and on his death in 1940 the house was requisitioned by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Hursley House is now occupied by IBM as part of IBM Hursley Laboratories. It is a Grade Two* Listed Building. Cranbury Park, a Grade One Listed Building in the parish of Hursley, now the home of the Chamberlayne- Macdonald family, was, in his later years, the one-time home of Sir Isaac Newton. The MP Paulet St John raised an obelisk monument at Farley Chamberlayne to honour a favourite horse. =Other notable residents= The Church of England theologian and poet John Keble was appointed Vicar of Hursley in 1835, rebuilt the church in 1848, and remained there until his death in 1866. Keble was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University from 1831 to 1841, and was the originator and subsequently one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Keble College, Oxford was founded in his memory. Keble is buried at All Saints' Church, Hursley. There is a memorial in the church to Dennis George Wyldbore Hewitt VC (1897–1917), recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I.

God's Word Heals (Whitaker House, 2010). About the Author in back of book. =Demons and deliverance= As a Pentecostal, Prince believed in the reality of spiritual forces operating in the world, and of the power of demons to cause illness and psychological problems. While in Seattle he was asked to perform an exorcism on a woman, and he came to believe that Christians could be \\"demonized\\" (normally described as \\"possessed\\" by demons - Prince avoided this term which implies 'ownership'). This was at odds with the more usual Pentecostal view that demons could \\"possess\\" unbelievers, but could only \\"oppress\\" Christians. Prince believed that his deliverance ministry used the power of God to defeat demons.Derek Prince. Blessings or Curse: You Can Choose!

His book The Destiny of Israel and the Church argues that the Church has not replaced Israel and that the covenant that God made with the nation of Israel still stands today. Prince also believed that the creation of the state of Israel was the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Derek states in his book Promised Land, \\"The central theme of biblical prophecy, as it is being unfolded in our time, revolves around the land and the people of Israel. God is carrying out His predetermined plan to regather the Jewish people from their worldwide dispersion and restore them to their ancient homeland.\\"Derek Prince Promised Land: God's Word and the Nation of Israel (Derek Prince Ministries-International, 2003) 55 The Shepherding Movement Prince created the Shepherding Movement with fellow ministers Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson and Ern Baxter, who became known as the 'Fort Lauderdale Five.' They sought to counter what were seen as excesses within the Charismatic Movement, by emphasizing discipleship and pastoral care. The practice of 'personal submission to spiritual authorities' was considered controversial.George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, Nov 10, 2016, p. 2104. Prince's association with the Shepherding Movement provided international exposure.

This was the earliest beginning of space gamma-ray astronomy. Launched on April 27, 1961 by a Juno II rocket, the satellite returned data until November 17, when power supply problems ended the science mission. During the spacecraft's seven-month lifespan it detected twenty-two events from gamma-rays and approximately 22,000 events from cosmic radiation. Instruments The Explorer 11 telescope, developed at MIT under the direction of William L. Kraushaar, used a combination of a sandwich scintillator detector along with a Cherenkov counter to measure the arrival directions and energies of high-energy gamma rays. Since the telescope could not be aimed, the spacecraft was set in a slow spin to scan the celestial sphere. Due to a higher than planned orbit that carried the spacecraft into the detector-jamming radiation of the Van Allen belt, and an early failure of the on-board tape recorder, only 141 hours of useful observing time could be culled from about 7 months during which the instrument operated. During this time thirty-one \\"gamma-ray signature\\" events were recorded when the telescope was pointing in directions well away from the Earth's atmosphere, which is a relatively bright source of gamma rays produced in interactions of ordinary cosmic ray protons with air atoms. The celestial distribution of the thirty-one arrival directions showed no statistically significant correlation with the direction of any potential cosmic source. Lacking such a correlation, the identification of the cause of the thirty-one events as gamma rays of cosmic origin could not be established. The results of the experiment were therefore reported as upper limits that were significantly lower than the limits obtained from previous balloon-borne experiments. An improved gamma-ray telescope, also developed at MIT under the direction of W. L. Kraushaar, was flown on the Third Solar Observatory (OSO-3), which was launched in 1967. It achieved the first definitive observation of high-energy cosmic gamma rays from both galactic and extragalactic sources. Later experiments, both in orbit and on the ground, have identified numerous discrete sources of cosmic gamma rays in our galaxy and beyond. References Kraushaar, W. L., G. W. Clark, G. Garmire, H.

Following nationalisation in 1948, BR had continued to build carriages to the designs of the \\"Big Four\\" companies (the Great Western, Southern, London Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern railways), and the Mark 1 was intended to be the standard carriage design for use across all lines, incorporating the best features of each of the former companies' designs. It was also designed to be much stronger than previous designs, to provide better protection for passengers in the event of a collision or derailment. The Mark 1 coaches were built in two distinct tranches: the early vehicles (1951–1960) and the 'Commonwealth' stock (named from the type of bogie used) from 1961 onwards. Construction buffer-and-chain/janney coupler with knuckle swung out of the way The design was used for hauled passenger stock, multiple unit carriages and non-passenger carrying stock. For passenger stock, construction continued from 1951 to 1963, while multiple units and non-passenger carrying stock continued to be built until 1974. Developed by Derby Carriage & Wagon Works, they were built at Derby, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Swindon, Wolverton and York works.British Railways All-Steel Carriages The Railway Magazine issue 582 July 1949 pages 255/256British Railways Standard Coaches Railway Gazette 16 March 1951 pages 295-297, 300 These were constructed in two lengths. Most had underframes long, with bogies at centres; the body was long if the coach was gangwayed, or if non-gangwayed. A smaller number had underframes long, with bogies at centres; the body was long if the carriage was gangwayed, or if non-gangwayed. The shorter vehicles were intended for use where the track curvature was too tight to accommodate the longer vehicles, due to excessive overhang. These lengths allowed for compartments or seating bays wide, plus space for toilets and entrance vestibules; a typical design of Mark 1 vehicle, the TO (Open Third class), had eight seating bays, three entrance vestibules and a pair of toilets at one end. This provided reasonable space. Care was taken to ensure that passengers could enjoy an unobstructed view out of the train from all seats. Seats were aligned to windows and on the long-distance design of Mark 1, the windows had a low sill, just above the floor. An unusual feature of the design was the bodyside tumblehome curvature, of radius and just noticeable; the windows had flat glass and consequently the upper quarter was separate and in a different plane from the lower glazing, with an intervening transom, and the steel panels were recessed on either side of each window opening to accommodate the difference between the flat glass and the curved sides. The opening portion of the windows were provided with sliding ventilators, with an external aerofoil for draught-free ventilation, the correct opening position being marked by a pair of arrows. Doors were provided with frameless droplights manufactured by Beclawat; these were supported by a spring-loaded lazytongs mechanism inside the lower part of the door, and the top of the window had a sprung metal clip engaging in slots on either side of the window opening. The original vehicles had timber veneer interior finishes, and on the main line vehicles small plastic labels were fixed to the panels, giving the type of wood and its country of origin e.g. \\"Crown Elm Great Britain\\"; \\"Lacewood Great Britain\\", etc. In 1955, an order was placed for 14 vehicles, with manufacturers being invited to incorporate innovative features; perhaps the most striking of these prototypes, which were completed in 1957, were those constructed by Cravens. Following evaluation, and with the increasing influence of the British Transport Design Panel, Mark 1 vehicles built from the later 1950s onwards were to modified designs. Laminates were used instead of timber panelling, and in the very last of the Mark 1 hauled vehicles, fluorescent lighting was fitted instead of tungsten bulbs. An important variant on the Mark 1 design were the 44 Pullman vehicles built by Metro- Cammell in 1960. A further change introduced in the late 1950s was the use of aluminium window frames instead of direct glazing into the steel panelling. The underframes consisted of a heavy assembly of steel sections, with angle used to form bracing trusses. These were placed close to the centre line of the vehicle rather than beneath the solebars, as was characteristic of previous vehicles. The original bogies were a double bolster type, which like the carriages mounted upon them, were designated \\"BR Mark 1\\" (BR1 for short). These proved unsatisfactory and a new cast-steel design was introduced from 1958 (often referred to as the Commonwealth type). This gave a superb ride with minimal tyre wear, but was heavy. The final batches of locomotive hauled Mark 1s, and many Mark 1 EMU vehicles, were built with the Swindon-designed B4 bogie. Later on, many BR1 bogie vehicles were retrofitted with the B4 bogie, and a comfortable ride could then be relied on, as was evident in the later EMU vehicles. An important factor was the compressive coupling, which provided excellent inter-vehicular damping through the gangway end-plates, which quickly became highly polished, indicating that they were performing this task. A device known as a tell-tale connects the emergency (communication) cord or chain to the train line to facilitate an emergency stop.Parkin Keith, British Rail Mark 1 Coaches 1991 1957 prototypes In 1957 a dozen carriages were built: four by Doncaster Works and two each by four outside contractors, in an attempt to improve on the existing design. While the passenger comfort level may have improved, the passenger capacity fell (except for the two built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company), resulting in a lower passenger per ton-of-train figure and disdain from BR's operating departments. Further orders to these designs were not forthcoming. Fibreglass bodied vehicles In 1962, Eastleigh Works constructed a single fibreglass bodied Mark 1. The vehicle, numbered S1000S, was mounted on the underframe of Mark 1 Tourist Second Open S4378, which was written off as a result of the Lewisham rail crash in 1957. Only the one example was built due to the cost, making this the only fibreglass-bodied passenger carriage built by British Railways. S1000S was used on the Hayling Island Branch Line until closure in 1963. After use as a generator van at Lancing Carriage Works, it re-entered capital stock. Its final duties were on commuter trains between and . After withdrawal, it was stored at . It was purchased in 1973 by the East Somerset Railway. In 2010, the carriage was restored, and is in service on the East Somerset Railway. Repainted into maroon when work carried out in 2016. A single van, no. E85000, also had fibreglass body panels. This was converted from a normal passenger carriage (Mark 1 Corridor Composite no. Sc15170) at Derby Carriage & Wagon Works in 1970 to carry parcels conveyed in BRUTE trolleys; it was used until 1982. It weighed , even though it was longer than a normal parcels van weighing . XP64 Near the end of the production of hauled Mark 1 stock came a series of eight experimental carriages known as the XP64 set. Three Corridor Firsts, two Corridor Seconds, and three Tourist Second Opens were built by Derby Carriage & Wagon Works in 1964.British Railways prototype train Railway Gazette 5 June 1964 page 427British Railways prototype passenger rolling-stock Railway Gazette 5 June 1964 pages 481/482 Externally they resembled Mark 1 stock with the addition of a cosmetic cover over the solebars of the standard Mark 1 underframes, but inside they included many new features, including pressure ventilation, new seating designs and wider bi-fold doors.Project XP 64 The Railway Magazine issue 759 July 1964 pages 540-544 Many of these features were later incorporated in the Mark 2 stock produced from 1964. Safety The British Rail Mark 1 was considerably stronger than most pre-nationalisation designs, and it was noticed as early as 1952 that the examples involved in the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash had withstood the impacts better than the older coaches around them. The improvement in safety the Mark 1 thus represented was praised by the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, Lt Col I.K.A. McNaughton (Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways, Department for Transport), in the Sir Seymour Biscoe Tritton Lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1977. Speaking of the fall in fatalities since 1955, he put forward his opinion that a major factor in this improvement was \\"the introduction in 1951 of the BR standard Mark 1 passenger carriage, which, over a period of about ten years, replaced pre-war designed rolling stock on most principal routes. The damage-resistant qualities of this all-steel coach, mounted on a 200 ton end-load resistant underframe and fitted with buckeye couplings, have been evidenced time and time again. Only in a small number of very destructive accidents has serious body damage of the kind that inevitably leads to fatal accidents been observed and there have been several remarkable instances of high-speed derailments in which no personal injuries have occurred.\\" Although construction of Mark 1 passenger stock ended in 1963, multiple units and non-passenger carrying stock based on the Mark 1 design continued to be built until 1974. The 1988 Clapham Junction rail accident highlighted that by the 1980s the Mark 1 coach was dated, and less able to withstand collisions than newer designs. Nevertheless, the Hidden Report into the disaster concluded that withdrawal of Mark 1 units was impractical and the design was not inherently unsafe: \\"The inventory of Mark I coaching stock is large, and much of it has not reached an end of economic life, nor will do so for another decade or more. Mark I vehicles have good riding qualities, and are not intrinsically lacking in collision resistance.\\"Hidden Inquiry Report (PDF), from The Railways Archive British Rail was still using some 4EPB and 2EPB (classes 415 and 416) multiple units with underframes that had been constructed before World War II and these were a priority for replacement. During the late 1990s Mark 1 stock began to reach the end of its design life and concerns about its safety relative to newer rolling stock became more pressing. The Health and Safety Executive issued instructions in 1999 per the Railway Safety Regulations 1999 to withdraw all Mark 1 carriages and multiple units based on that design by the end of 2002 unless rebodied or modified to reduce the potential for overriding in the event of a collision. A proposed modification to extend mainline use beyond 2002 at the time of the 1999 HSE instruction was 'cup and cone', however trials were inconclusive and deemed expensive in comparison with the safety benefits. In October 2002 the Health and Safety Executive extended the permitted use of Mark 1 based rolling stock until 31 December 2004 with the proviso they be fitted with a Train Protection & Warning System. Post- privatisation A West Coast Railways' Mark 1 diagram AB302 corridor brake composite coach number 21266 at Castleton East Junction with Mark 1 diagram AD103 open first coach number 99127 behind, March 2009 During the 1990s, the few remaining Mark 1 loco-hauled vehicles on the main line were withdrawn, having been progressively replaced by Mark 2 and Mark 3 stock through the 1970s and 1980s. However, the extensive Network SouthEast commuter network on the former Southern Region operated by the Network SouthCentral, Network SouthEastern and South West Trains shadow franchises was worked mainly by Mark 1 based multiple units of the 205, 207, 411, 412, 421, 422 and 423 classes. When British Rail was privatised in the mid-1990s, only Connex South Eastern was given an extended franchise (15 years) in return for ordering new trains. Connex South Central and South West Trains, the other major users of Mark 1 multiple units, were not required to order new trains. As a result, in 2000, Mark 1 units were still in use across most of the former Southern Region with no new trains having been ordered. When the franchises were relet in the early 2000s, they were done with a requirement to replace the Mark 1s, thus hundreds of new multiple units of classes 171, 375, 376, 377, 444, 450 and 458 were introduced by Connex South Eastern, South West Trains and Southern between 2001 and 2005. A similar story took place in Scotland, with the last of ScotRail's Mark 1 based Class 303 multiple units surviving until December 2002.ScotRail withdraws final Strathclyde 303s Rail issue 452 8 January 2003 page 6 The use of Mark 1 stock on postal trains was curtailed when the Royal Mail partially replaced them in the early 1990s. The postal train services on the West Coast Main Line were worked using new Class 325 multiple units. However, these units proved to be extremely troublesome in service and due to technical failures were often loco-hauled instead of running under their own power, and therefore Mark 1 formations continued to be used here, and elsewhere on the network. However, in January 2004, the Royal Mail ceased using rail to transport mail traffic.End of the line for mail trains BBC News 9 January 2004 Thus, the problem of how to replace the large numbers of Mark 1 carriages on these services was resolved. Network Rail continue to use converted Mark 1 coaches for various departmental duties – test trains, sandite units, and accommodation units for worksite personnel are some examples.LH converts 421 coach to test vehicle Rail issue 484 31 March 2004 page 27 A small number of railtour companies have waivers to operate Mark 1 carriage stock on railtour duties. The conditions usually involve the fitting of central door locking and having either a non-passenger or non-Mark 1 carriage at the ends of the train. This is often achieved by running with a locomotive at each end of the train, instead of just at the front, which also reduces the need to run-round at minor terminus stations, many of which lost their run-round facilities when locomotive hauled trains of Mark 1 or Mark 2 coaches gave way to multiple unit operation on service trains.

In particular vehicles lacking central door locking require a steward to be present in each vehicle. Train companies are also recommended to run Mark 1 stock with more robust non- Mark 1 stock at either end to act as a barrier in the case of collisions. Mark 1s continue to be used on special charter trains with charter operators including North Yorkshire Moors Railway, Riviera Trains, Vintage Trains and West Coast Railways.Railtours West Coast Railways The Office of Rail & Road has granted these operators an exemption to the Railway Safety Regulations 1999 to continue to operate Mark 1s on the main line until 2023.Mark I and hinged door rolling stock exemptions Office of Rail & Road Preservation The Jacobite en route to Mallaig in 2005 Restored Mark 1 carriages have entered service on many of the UK's heritage railways. Their ready availability has avoided the need for the railways to rely on the limited quantity of surviving pre-BR carriage stock – most examples of which had been scrapped before the railway preservation movement had properly started. The long service life of Mark 1 carriages means that a heritage railway can (potentially) recreate an authentic period train of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or early 1990s, when painted in a suitable livery. Liveries Crimson and Cream Mark1 coaches E25994 and 95228 on the Mid-Norfolk Railway British Railways Mark I carriages have been painted in a wide range of liveries. On introduction in 1951 the carriages were painted Crimson Lake (the official Railways Executive designation), usually referred to as Crimson (BS381C:540 Crimson being the British Standard colour reference) and Cream (the combination often referred to colloquially as \\"blood and custard\\") for corridor stock and Crimson for non-corridor stock. Corridor passenger stock was normally also lined out whereas non-corridor stock was not. The term 'Carmine' is often incorrectly used as a consequence of an error made by a contemporary railway journalist and has, unfortunately, been repeated ever since. 1956 saw the first big changes, with the end of 'third class' and the return of regional colour schemes. The Western Region promptly adopted Great Western Railway chocolate and cream livery for vehicles used on its named express trains and maroon for other stock. The Southern Region reverted to green and the other regions adopted maroon. 1962 saw Southern Region adopt the now familiar yellow cantrail above first class and red above dining cars. By the end of the 1960s this was found on all carriages. In 1962 the Western Region abandoned the use of chocolate and cream. With the introduction of spray painting in 1964, the coach ends became the same colour as the bodywork. A year later the ubiquitous British Rail blue and grey was introduced with the Mark 2s, and by 1968 most non-suburban Mark I stock was blue and grey; however it wasn't until 1974 that the last maroon Mark 1 was repainted into blue and grey livery. The use of blue and grey continued until 1982 when the first experiments in new liveries occurred. During the BR blue period other changes took place - notably the last 'Ladies Only' compartments vanished in 1977. 1982 saw a proliferation of new liveries, including yellow and grey for stock that was requisitioned for engineering and maintenance work. In 1985 some carriages reappeared in chocolate and cream for the GWR 150th anniversary celebrations, along with a brief Scottish experiment in green and cream. Then around 1988 reclassification of 'second class' as 'standard class' took place. 1983 was the year that the InterCity livery was first seen, 1986 the introduction of Network SouthEast and the end of the Searail livery. During the 1980s a complete rake of 1950s built corridor compartment second class Mark 1s (including a BSK) which operated exclusively on the Glasgow - Stranraer route and connected with the Irish Sea ferries, were painted into a very striking Sealink livery of red, blue, and white, and internally the vestibules (but not the main side corridors) were painted bright yellow to match the refurbished EMUs of the period. Being early 1950s coaches these had all-timber interiors which lent themselves to painting. Following withdrawal from the Stranraer line towards the end of the 1980s this rake was used by ScotRail on \\"Merrymaker\\" charter services, including long-distance trips on the West Coast Main Line, before eventually being withdrawn completely at the very end of the 1980s. 1988 saw the first Regional Railways livery (as well as postal trains and parcels trains turning Royal Mail red). From 1995/96 private operators began to paint their stock their own colours.

David Pawson (25 February 1930 – 21 May 2020) was an evangelical minister, writer and prominent Bible teacher based in the United Kingdom. Biography According to his autobiography, Pawson's immediate ancestors were all farmers, Methodist preachers or both, dating back to John Pawson, a friend and follower of John Wesley. His father, Henry Cecil Pawson FRSE (1897–1978), was head of Agriculture at Durham University and Vice President of the Methodist conference. From his childhood in the north of England David Pawson had wanted to be a farmer, but by the time he had completed his studies for a BSc in Agriculture at Durham University, he felt God was calling him into full-time Christian ministry. He then studied for an M.A. in theology at Wesley House, Cambridge, and subsequently joined the Royal Air Force as a chaplain, serving in Aden. After leaving the RAF he served as a Methodist minister, but became increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of infant baptism. After appearing before a doctrinal committee of the Methodist church, he volunteered to leave the denomination, and did so. Shortly thereafter he accepted an invitation to become the pastor of Gold Hill Baptist Church in Buckinghamshire. Later, as pastor of Guildford Baptist Church ('Millmead', which he helped to design), he established a reputation among both evangelicals and charismatics as a Bible teacher. From here his teaching tapes – originally made for the church's sick and elderly members – became popular worldwide. Under his ministry, Millmead became one of the largest Baptist churches in the United Kingdom. Pawson left Millmead in 1979 and engaged in an itinerant worldwide Bible teaching ministry predominantly through seminars for church leaders in Asia, Australia, Africa, England, Europe, and the United States. Millions of copies of his teachings have been distributed in more than 120 countries. He was a writer and speaker with a reputation of urgency, clarity, and uncompromising faithfulness to the Scriptures. His extensive and very accessible overviews of the books of the Bible have been published and recorded in Unlocking the Bible, available on CDs, DVDs, and YouTube. He is widely considered to be one of the world's finest biblical expositors. Pawson died on Ascension Day, 21 May, 2020 at the age of 90. Teachings In The Normal Christian Birth, Pawson argued that a biblical initiation into Christianity should involve more than the simple \\"Sinner's Prayer\\". Whilst accepting the fundamental basis of salvation by faith, he argued that the Biblical model of a person's \\"birth\\" into God's kingdom included aspects which are frequently ignored or forgotten today. He proposed four principal steps: repentance towards God; believing in Jesus; baptism in water; and receiving the Holy Spirit. This, according to Pawson, is the biblical pattern for a \\"normal Christian birth\\". According to the book itself, \\"David Pawson advocates a synthesis of the 'liberal' emphasis on repentance, the 'evangelical' on faith, the 'sacramental' on baptism and the 'pentecostal' on the Spirit.\\" This book has been influential and is taught at a number of theological seminaries and mission stations. In Leadership is Male, he teaches that leadership is a role given by God to men. In so doing, he criticizes men for not taking proper responsibility in important aspects of family and church life. He argues that modern men too often neglect their social obligations and should return to the Biblical model of manhood. This book's foreword was written by a woman, Elisabeth Elliot. In The Road to Hell, Pawson is critical of Annihilationism, the teaching that the punishment of hell is not eternal. He teaches that people who go to hell experience eternal suffering. According to the book itself, by \\"challenging the modern alternatives of liberal 'universalism' and evangelical 'annihilationism', David Pawson presents the traditional concept of endless torment as soundly biblical.\\" In Unlocking the Bible, Pawson presents a book by book study of the whole Bible. The book is based on his belief that the Bible should be studied, as it was written, \\"a book at a time\\" (certainly not a verse, or even a chapter at a time), and that each book is best understood by discovering why and for whom it was written. It is based on an arranged series of talks in which he set out the background, purpose, meaning and relevance of each book of the Bible, and was transcribed into written form by Andy Peck. The groundwork for this study was laid in the 1960s and 70s, when Pawson took his congregation through nearly half of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament line by line (recordings of those studies are still distributed). In When Jesus Returns, he critically considers in the light of scripture the major views on eschatology popular in the church today, specifically the preterist, historicist, futurist and idealist schools of interpreting the Book of Revelation. He rejects postmillennialism in favour of a premillennial understanding of the Second Coming, so that Jesus will return bodily in power immediately before his reign over the world for a millennium from Jerusalem. He asserts that the supernatural taking up of believers alive at this time (following the 'tribulation' period of persecution), so as to join the returning Christ, fulfils the Rapture prophecies; he argues against a pre- tribulation timing of the rapture. He further argues that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church), so that the outstanding prophecies about Israel will be fulfilled before the end of the age. In Jesus Baptises in One Holy Spirit, Pawson discusses the evidence for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as a separate event from believing, repentance and water baptism. He argues that a believer does not receive the indwelling Holy Spirit until s/he is baptized in the Spirit, a distinct experience evidenced by charismatic gifts such as prophecy or tongues. This differs from the evangelical view that the Spirit is automatically received when a person believes, and the Pentecostal view that receiving the indwelling Spirit (at conversion) and receiving the Baptism in the Spirit are two experiences with different purposes. In The Challenge of Islam to Christians, Pawson documents the present rapid rise of Islam in the West. He explains what Islam is, arguing that its rejection of Jesus Christ's divinity mean the two faiths cannot be reconciled, and he proposes a Christian response, based on the church purifying itself. The book details Pawson's testing of his premonition that Britain would become Islamic. In comparing the situation to that portrayed by the Hebrew prophet Habakkuk, Pawson implies that the rise of Islam could be impending judgement for the immorality into which Western churches and secular humanist society has sunk. In Once Saved, Always Saved?, Pawson uses scripture to question the frequent evangelical claim that someone who has once believed in Jesus Christ will end up with Christ in heaven whatever that person subsequently believes or does. (Twelve years earlier, another evangelical, RT Kendall, summed up this claim in a book having the same title without a question mark.) Pawson points to the need to persevere in faith, and to the repeated exhortations in scripture to do so. In Word and Spirit Together: Uniting Charismatics and Evangelicals (a revision of Fourth Wave), Pawson calls for an end to the division between charismatic and Evangelical Christians over the issue of Spiritual Baptism and charismatic gifts. He argues that the charismatic gifts are for the church today but that their practice should be built on a solid scriptural basis. He therefore argues that the two groups should learn from each other, to the benefit of both. In Defending Christian Zionism, Pawson puts the case that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that Christians should support the existence of the Jewish State (although not unconditionally its actions) on theological grounds. He also argues that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church, as in \\"replacement theology\\"). However he criticises Dispensationalism, a largely American movement holding similar views about Israel. Pawson's book Israel in the New Testament continues the Christian Zionist theme. Pawson wrote a number of Commentaries where he went through an entire book of the Bible in detail. This series is based on the preaching of David Pawson to his congregation back in the 60s and 70s. This series, which includes almost all of the books of the New Testament Books and selected books of the Old Testament, was added to on a regular basis. Works Pawson was the author of more than 80 books, produced more than 300 teaching videos and more than 1500 audio recordings.   - later published as Word and spirit together : uniting Charismatics and Evangelicals                    References =Citations= = Sources =  External links David Pawson Teaching Trust, UK – a non-profit making trust designed to protect and promote the teaching for future years. * www.davidpawsonbooks.com * www.explainingbiblicaltruth.global * 1930 births 2020 deaths English Baptist ministers Alumni of Durham University Royal Air Force chaplains English military chaplains Alumni of Wesley House Arminian writers Arminian theologians Arminian ministers Former Methodists ","title":"David Pawson"},{"id":"1205498","text":"The International Zetetic Challenge (from Greek ζητεῖν zēteîn, \\"to search\\") was an attempt to prove or disprove the existence of, or demonstrate events related to, the paranormal.

Physical characteristics A male showing his canines A skull preserved at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands The hair of the lion- tailed macaque is black. Its outstanding characteristic is the silver-white mane which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin, which gives this monkey its German name Bartaffe - \\"beard ape\\". The hairless face is black in colour. With a head-body length of 42 to 61 cm and a weight of 2 to 10 kg, it ranks among the smaller macaques. The tail is medium in length at about 25 cm, and has a black tuft at the end that is similar to a lion's tail, although this tuft is more pronounced in males than in females. Gestation is approximately six months. The young are nursed for one year. Sexual maturity is reached at four years for females, and six years for males. The life expectancy in the wild is approximately 20 years, while in captivity is up to 30 years. It is most closely related to Pigtail Macaque, found in southeast Asia. 20 lakh(2 million) years ago due to the ice age in northern hemisphere, the vegetation cover of Asia and India drastically reduced due to reduction of monsoon, due to which these two monkeys separated from each other and evolved in different ways and we can see the result. Behaviour Lion-tailed macaque in Nilgiri hills The lion-tailed macaque is a rainforest dweller; it is diurnal, meaning it is active exclusively in daylight hours. It is a good climber and spends a majority of its life in the upper canopy of tropical moist evergreen forests. Unlike other macaques, it typically avoids humans when possible. In group behavior, the lion-tailed macaque is much like other macaques, living in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 members, which usually consist of few males and many females. It is a territorial animal, defending its area first with loud cries towards the invading troops. If this proves to be fruitless, it brawls aggressively; these aggressive interactions can range from a simple chase or igniting a fight when feeling aggravated. On the other hand, when around mutualistic species, they do not engage vigorously. Mating Lion-tailed macaque behaviour is characterized by typical patterns such as arboreal living, selectively feeding on a large variety of fruit trees, large interindividual spaces while foraging, and time budgets with high proportion of time devoted to exploration and feeding. It primarily eats indigenous fruits, leaves, buds, insects and small vertebrates in virgin forest, but can adapt to rapid environmental change in areas of massive selective logging through behavioural modifications and broadening of food choices to include fruits, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, cones, mesocarp, and other parts of many nonindigenous and pioneer plants. In the forests of Kerala they were observed preying on nestling and eggs of pigeons. Population Female lion tailed macaque with her infant A recent assessment for IUCN reports 3000-3500 of these animals live scattered over several areas in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, KarnatakaMolur S, D Brandon-Jones, W Dittus, A.

Zoo Outreach Organization/CBSG-South Asia, Coimbatore The lion-tailed macaque ranks among the rarest and most threatened primates. Their range has become increasingly isolated and fragmented by the spread of agriculture and tea, coffee, teak and cinchona, construction of water reservoirs for irrigation and power generation, and human settlements to support such activities. They do not live, feed or travel through plantations. Destruction of their habitat and their avoidance of human proximity have led to the drastic decrease of their population. From 1977 to 1980, public concern about the endanged status of lion-tailed macaque became the focal point of Save Silent Valley, India's fiercest environmental debate of the decade. From 1993 to 1996, 14 troops were observed in Silent Valley National Park, Kerala, one of the most undisturbed viable habitats left for them. Silent Valley has the largest number of lion tailed macaque in South India. Other protected areas in Kerala include Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary, Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary, Periyar Tiger Reserve and its premises (Gavi and Konni), Eravikulam National Park, Pambadum Shola National Park, Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, Annaimalai Tiger Reserve, New Amarambalam Reserved Forest, Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary and Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary and Wayanad region. A self-sustainable single population of 32 groups of lion-tailed macaques occurred in Sirsi-Honnavara, Karnataka, the northernmost population of the species. A local census concluded in 2007, conducted in the Theni District of Tamil Nadu, put their numbers at around 250, which was considered encouraging, because until then, no lion-tailed macaques had been reported in that specific area. The species is also prominently found in the Papanasam part of the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. Many zoos take part in breeding programs which help to secure the survival of this species. About 338 of these macaques are reported to live in zoos. However, it is no longer on ‘The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates’ list, after the international body compiling it determined that the local governments in southern India had acted positively to protect it.

The work is a novel in verse composed of 590 Onegin stanzas (sonnets written in iambic tetrameter, with the rhyme scheme following the AbAbCCddEffEgg pattern of Eugene Onegin). It was inspired by Charles Johnston's translation of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. Plot summary Set in the 1980s, The Golden Gate follows a group of yuppies in San Francisco. The inciting action occurs when protagonist John Brown has his friend Janet Hayakawa place an amorous advertisement of himself in the newspaper; the latter answered, at length, by trial-lawyer Elisabeth ('Liz') Dorati. A short heyday follows, in which Seth introduces and develops a variety of characters united in part by their interest in self-actualization (often in the form of agriculture) and in part by closeness to Liz or John. Thereafter is depicted the progress of their marriage de facto until its dissolution, which results in the legal marriage of Liz to John's friend Phillip ('Phil') Weiss, and the birth of their son. Following his rejection of Liz, John finds a second paramour in Janet, until the latter and two other friends die in an automobile collision; and is himself invited to stand godfather to Liz's son. The novel brought its author the 1988 Sahitya Akademi Award for English, by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. Background At the time of the novel's composition, Seth was a graduate student in Economics at Stanford University.Vikram Seth returns to the Golden Gate Seth described the origins of the novel as a \\"pure fluke.\\" While conducting tedious research for his dissertation, Seth would divert himself with trips to the Stanford Bookstore: > On one such occasion, I found in the poetry section, two translations of > Eugene Onegin, Alexander Pushkin's great novel in verse. Two translations > but each of them maintained the same stanzaic form that Pushkin had used. > Not because I was interested in Pushkin or Eugene Onegin, but purely because > I thought, this is interesting technically that both of them should have > been translated so faithfully, at least as far as the form goes. I began to > compare the two translations, to get access to the original stanzas behind > them, as I don’t know Russian. After a while, that exercise failed, because > I found myself reading one of them for pure pleasure. I must have read it > five times that month. It was addictive. And suddenly, I realized that this > was the form I was looking for to tell my tales of California. The little > short stories I had in my mind subsided and this more organically oriented > novel came into being.

The original objective of the KGC was to annex a \\"golden circle\\" of territories in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean as slave states. As abolitionism in the United States increased after the Dred Scott Decision of 1857, the members proposed a separate confederation of slave states, with U.S. states south of the Mason-Dixon line to secede and to align with other slave states to be formed from the \\"golden circle\\". In either case, the goal was to increase the power of the Southern slave-holding upper class to such a degree that it could never be dislodged.Woodward, Colin American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America New York:2011 Penguin Page 207 During the American Civil War, some Southern sympathizers in the Union or Northern states, such as Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, were accused of belonging to the Knights of the Golden Circle, and in some cases, such as that of Lambdin P. Milligan, they were imprisoned for their activities. Early history George W. L. Bickley, a doctor, editor, and \\"adventurer\\" who lived in Cincinnati, founded the association. Records of the KGC convention held in 1860 state that the organization \\"originated at Lexington, Kentucky, on the fourth day of July 1854, by five gentlemen who came together on a call made by Gen. George Bickley\\". He organized the first castle, or local branch, in Cincinnati in 1854. Hounded by creditors, he left Cincinnati in the late 1850s and traveled through the East and South, promoting an expedition to Mexico. The group's original goal was to provide a force to colonize the northern part of Mexico and the West Indies. This would extend pro-slavery interests. In August 1861 the New York Times described the order as a successor to the Order of the Lone Star, which had been organized for the purpose of conquering Cuba and Nicaragua, succeeding in the latter cause in 1856 under William Walker before being driven out by a coalition of neighboring states. At that time the order's prime objective was said to be to raise an army of 16,000 men to conquer and \\"Southernize\\" Mexico, while supporting the Knights of the Columbian Star for public office. Before the Civil War several members of President James Buchanan's administration were members of the order. Both Secretaries of War and Treasury, John Floyd and Howell Cobb respectively, were members of the circle in addition to Vice President John Breckenridge. Secretary of War John Floyd received instructions from the Order to \\"seize Navy-yards, Forts, etc. while KGC members were still Cabinet officers and Senators\\". Floyd used his position as Secretary of War to move munitions and men to the South towards the end of Buchanan's presidency. His plot was discovered, and led to greater distrust of Secret Societies and Copperheads in general. This distrust was the result of a confirmed plot to overthrow the federal government, rather than general discontent. Civil War =Southwest= In 1859, future Confederate States Army brigadier general Elkanah Greer established KGC castles in East Texas and Louisiana.Hudson, Linda S. \\"The Knights of the Golden Circle in Texas, 1858–1861: An Analysis of the First (Military) Degree Knights\\", p. 53, in Howell, Kenneth W., ed. The Seventh Star of the Confederacy: Texas during the Civil War. University of North Texas Press: Denton, Texas, 2009. . Although a Unionist, United States Senator Sam Houston introduced a resolution in the U.S. Senate in 1858 for the \\"United States to declare and maintain an efficient protectorate over the States of Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and San Salvador.\\" This measure, which supported the goal of the KGC, failed to be adopted. In the spring of 1860, Elkanah Greer had become general and grand commander of 4,000 Military Knights in the KGC's Texas division of 21 castles. The Texas KGC supported President of the United States James Buchanan's policy of, and draft treaty for, protecting routes for U.S commerce across Mexico, which also failed to be approved by the U.S. Senate.Hudson, 2009, p. 54. With the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, the Texas KGC changed its emphasis from a plan to expand U.S. territory into Mexico in order to focus its efforts on providing support for the Southern States' secession from the Union.Hudson, 2009, pp. 55-56. On February 15, 1861, Ben McCulloch, United States Marshal and former Texas Ranger, began marching toward the Federal arsenal at San Antonio, Texas, with a cavalry force of about 550 men, about 150 of whom were Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC) from six castles.Keehn, David C. Knights of the Golden Circle: Secret Empire, Southern Secession, Civil War. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2013. . As volunteers continued to join McCulloch the following day, United States Army Brevet Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs decided to surrender the arsenal peacefully to the secessionists. Twiggs was appointed a major general in the Confederate States Army on May 22, 1861. KGC members also figured prominently among those who, in 1861, joined Lt. Col. John Robert Baylor in his temporarily successful takeover of southern New Mexico Territory.Thompson, Jerry D. Colonel John Robert Baylor: Texas Indian Fighter and Confederate Soldier. Hillsboro, Tex: Hill Junior College Press, 1971. . In May 1861, members of the KGC and the Confederate Rangers attacked a building which housed a pro-Union newspaper, the Alamo Express, owned by J. P. Newcomb, and burned it down. Other KGC members followed Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley on the 1862 New Mexico Campaign, which sought to bring the New Mexico Territory into the Confederate fold. Both Baylor and Trevanion Teel, Sibley's captain of artillery, had been among the KGC members who rode with Ben McCulloch. =North= In early 1862, Radical Republicans in the Senate, aided by Secretary of State William H. Seward, suggested that former president Franklin Pierce, who was greatly critical of the Lincoln administration's war policies, was an active member of the Knights of the Golden Circle. In an angry letter to Seward, Pierce denied that he knew anything about the KGC, and demanded that his letter be made public. California Senator Milton Latham subsequently did so when he entered the entire PierceSeward correspondence into the Congressional Globe. Appealing to the Confederacy's friends in both the North and the border states, the Order spread to Kentucky as well as the southern parts of such Union states as Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri. It became strongest among Copperheads, who were Democrats who wanted to end the Civil War via settlement with the South. Some supported slavery and others were worried about the power of the federal government. In the summer of 1863, Congress authorized a military draft, which the administration soon put into operation. Loyalist Leaders of the Democratic Party opposed to Abraham Lincoln's administration denounced the draft and other wartime measures, such as the arrest of seditious persons and the president's temporary suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, scam artists in south-central Pennsylvania sold Pennsylvania Dutch farmers $1 paper tickets purported to be from the Knights of the Golden Circle. Along with a series of secret hand gestures, these tickets were supposed to protect the horses and other possessions of ticket holders from seizure by invading Confederate soldiers.Cassandra Morris Small letters, York County (PA) Heritage Trust files When Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's infantry division passed through York County, Pennsylvania, they took what they needed anyway. They often paid with Confederate States dollars or with drafts on the Confederate government. The Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart also reported the alleged KGC tickets when documenting the campaign. That same year, Asbury Harpending and California members of the Knights of the Golden Circle in San Francisco outfitted the schooner J. M. Chapman as a Confederate privateer in San Francisco Bay, with the object of raiding commerce on the Pacific Coast and capturing gold shipments to the East Coast. Their attempt was detected and they were seized on the night of their intended departure.\\"The Pacific Squadron of 1861–1866\\", in Aurora Hunt, The Army of the Pacific; Its Operations in California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Plains Region, Mexico, etc. 1860–1866 In late 1863, the KGC reorganized as the Order of American Knights. In 1864, it became the Order of the Sons of Liberty, with the Ohio politician Clement L. Vallandigham, most prominent of the Copperheads, as its supreme commander. In most areas only a minority of its membership was radical enough to discourage enlistments, resist the draft, and shield deserters. The KGC held numerous peace meetings. A few agitators, some of them encouraged by Southern money, talked of a revolt in the Old Northwest, with the goal of ending the war.William B. Hesseline, Lincoln and the War Governors, Alfred A. Knopf, 1948. . p. 312. Survival conspiracy theory The Los Angeles Times noted that one theory, among many, on the origin of the Saddle Ridge Hoard of gold coins is that it was cached by the KGC, which \\"some believe buried millions in ill-gotten gold across a dozen states to finance a second Civil War\\".

The Japanese embassy with Pope Gregory XIII on March 23, 1585.The World and Japan, p. 165. The Tenshō embassy (Japanese: 天正の使節, named after the Tenshō Era in which the embassy took place) was an embassy sent by the Japanese Christian Lord Ōtomo Sōrin to the Pope and the kings of Europe in 1582. The embassy was led by Mancio Itō (伊東 マンショ Itō Mansho, 1570–1612), a Japanese nobleman, who was the first official Japanese emissary to Europe. Embassy The idea of sending a Japanese embassy to Europe was originally conceived by the Jesuit Alessandro Valignano, and sponsored by the three Kirishitan daimyōs Ōmura Sumitada (1533–1587), Ōtomo Sōrin (1530–1587), and Arima Harunobu (1567–1612). Mancio Itō was chosen to act as a spokesman for the group dispatched by Ōtomo Sōrin, who was daimyō of the Bungo Province on Kyūshū and a close relative of Mancio's father; Shurinosuke Itō. On February 20, 1582, Mancio Itō left Nagasaki in company with three other noblemen: * Miguel Chijiwa (千々石 ミゲル Chijiwa Migeru) * Julião Nakaura (中浦 ジュリアン Nakaura Jurian) * Martinho Hara (原 マルチノ Hara Maruchino) They were accompanied by two servants, their tutor and interpreter Diogo de Mesquita, and their mentor Valignano, who only accompanied them as far as Goa in Portuguese India, where he was to take up new responsibilities. On their way to Lisbon, where they arrived in August 1584, they spent nine months visiting the Portuguese territories of Macau, Kochi, and Goa. From Lisbon, the ambassadors went on to Madrid and then to Rome, which were the two main goals of their journey. In Spain they visit Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Madrid, where they met with Philip II who was king of Spain and Portugal. They visit El Escorial monastery, the Alcalá University, Murcia and Alicante. In Rome, Mancio Itō became an honorary citizen and taken into the ranks of European nobility with the title Cavaliere di Speron d'oro (\\"Knight of the Golden Spur\\"). During their stay in Europe, they met with King Philip II of Spain, Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Pope Gregory XIII, and his successor Pope Sixtus V. Title page of the Mission report The ambassadors arrived back in Japan on July 21, 1590. On their eight-year-long voyage they had been instructed to take notes. These notes provided the basis for the De Missione Legatorum Iaponensium ad Romanam Curiam (\\"The Mission of the Japanese Legates to the Roman Curia\\"), a Macau- based writing by Jesuit Duarte de Sande published in 1590.According to Massarella, \\"both Valignano and de Sande emphasised that the book was based on journals kept by the boys during their trip, and that the boys, whose time was strictly governed, had been diligent in keeping them. Unfortunately, these journals are no longer extant and we have no knowledge about which language they used for writing them.\\" (4) According to Derek Massarella, \\"Valignano conceived the idea of a book based on the boys’ travels, one that could also be used for teaching purposes in Jesuit colleges in Japan,\\" but \\"despite its authors’ intentions,\\" De Missione \\"made no lasting impact on Japanese perceptions of Europe.Massarella, 2, 8 The four were subsequently ordained as the first Japanese Jesuit fathers by Alessandro Valignano. Mancio Itō died in Nagasaki on November 13, 1612. Martinho Hara was banished from Japan by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1614, and acted in Macau. He died in Macau on October 23, 1629. Miguel Chijiwa left the Society of Jesus before 1601, and died in Nagasaki on January 23, 1633. Although he is generally believed to have abandoned Christianity, the discovery of what appear to be rosary beads in his grave in 2017 place this in some doubt. Julião Nakaura was caught by the Tokugawa shogunate, and died a martyr by torture in Nagasaki on November 21, 1633. He was beatified on November 24, 2008.

The estate is in Hampshire, England, about south of Newbury, Berkshire and north of Andover, Hampshire. It is the country seat of the Earl of Carnarvon, a branch of the Anglo-Welsh Herbert family. Highclere Castle has been used as a filming location for several films and television series, including 1990s comedy series Jeeves and Wooster, and achieved international fame as the main location for the historical drama series Downton Abbey (2010–15) and the 2019 film based on it. The house, Egyptian exhibition, and gardens are open to the public for self-guided tours during the summer months and at other times during the rest of the year, such as Christmas and Easter. The house also holds ticketed events, such as the Battle Proms picnic concert, and special guided tours throughout the year. History =Early years= The house stands on the site of an earlier house, which was built on the foundations of the medieval palace of the Bishops of Winchester, who owned this estate from the 9th century. The original site was recorded in the Domesday Book. =Edward II= An itinerary of King Edward II lists him as spending 2 September 1320 with Rigaud of Assier, the Bishop of Winchester, at Bishop's Clere, alias Highclere. The same tour has him on 31 August 1320 at Sandleford Priory, where he apparently stayed for the night,tarried is the word used in the records quoted by Walter Money. and on 29 and 30 August he was at Crookham, Berkshire.Walter Money, Newbury, page 160. =Robert Sawyer= The palace was rebuilt as Highclere Place House in 1679 when it was purchased by Sir Robert Sawyer, the Attorney General to Charles II and James II, who was a lawyer, MP, Speaker, and college friend of Samuel Pepys. In 1692, Sawyer bequeathed the mansion at Highclere to his only daughter, Margaret, the first wife of the 8th Earl of Pembroke. Their second son, Robert Sawyer Herbert, inherited Highclere, began its portrait collection and created the garden temples. His nephew and heir Henry Herbert was created Baron Porchester and later Earl of Carnarvon by George III. =Milles and Pococke families= In 1680 Sir Robert Sawyer presented the living of Highclere to the Rev. Isaac Milles (1638–1720), the elder, who remained there till his death. White Oak was the parsonage where Milles took pupils, including the many children of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, by marriage the new proprietor of Highclere. The Rev. Isaac Milles (fl. 1701–1727), the younger,BA of Balliol College (1696), MA from Sidney Sussex, Cambridge (1701), treasurer of the diocese of Waterford 21 May 1714, and non-resident prebendary of Lismore, County Waterford 6 September 1716. carried on his father's school at Highclere.And resigned his Irish benefices in 1727 to become rector of nearby Ludshelfe or Litchfield, Hampshire. The daughter of Milles, the younger, Elizabeth married Reverend Richard Pococke,Headmaster of the King Edward VI Free Grammar School, and curate, under sequestration, of All Saints' Church in Southampton. Son of another Richard Pococke, LL.B., rector of Colmer, Hampshire, from 1660 to his death in 1719. LL.B. (1660–1710) and had the Rt. Rev. Richard Pococke (1704–1765), who having been educated by his grandfather Milles, at his school at Highclere rectory, went on to become domestic chaplain to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, and then Bishop of Ossory and Meath, and a renowned travel writer and orientalist. Bishop Pococke was one of the first to collect seeds of the Cedar of Lebanon which he did during his tour of Lebanon in 1738.He reached Dendereh on 9 January 1738. Some of these seeds germinated and grew at Highclere and Wilton House, but probably also at nearby Sandleford and his family's own Newtown House, Hampshire.History of Newtown by Doug Ellis, Newtown Parish Council, 2015.F. Nigel Hepper, in Arboricultural Journal: The International Journal of Urban Forestry, Volume 25, Issue 3, 2001 : THE CULTIVATION OF THE CEDAR OF LEBANON IN WESTERN EUROPEAN PARKS AND GARDENS FROM THE 17TH TO THE 19TH CENTURY. Coincidentally, the seemingly unrelated and earlier Rev. Edward Pococke (1604–1691), another orientalist, was sometime vicar of Chieveley, and then rector of Childrey both nearby in Berkshire, was an even earlier importer of the cedar.Nigel Hepper in the abstract to his 2001 article (ibid): 'The earliest extant cedar in England is Edward Pocock's at Childrey. Oxfordshire (c. 1642).' And of his six sons, the eldest, Edward Pococke (1648–1727) was chaplain to the Earl of Pembroke, and rector of Minall or Mildenhall, Wiltshire (1692), and canon of Salisbury (1675).DNB =William Cobbett's description= William Cobbett (1763–1835) in his journal of 2 November 1821, while at Hurstbourne Tarrant wrote: > I came from Berghclere this morning, and through the park of Lord > Caernarvon, at Highclere.

It is in the Jacobethan style and faced in Bath stone, reflecting the Victorian revival of English architecture of the late 16th century and early 17th century, when Tudor architecture was being challenged by newly arrived Renaissance architecture influences. During the 19th century there was a huge Renaissance Revival movement, of which Sir Charles Barry was a great exponent—Barry described the style of Highclere as Anglo-Italian.Henry Russell Hitchcock (1958) Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (Pelican History of Art), London, Penguin Books, p.73. Barry had been inspired to become an architect by the Renaissance architecture of Italy and was very proficient at working in the Renaissance-based style that became known in the 19th century as Italianate architecture. At Highclere, however, he worked in the Jacobethan style, but added to it some of the motifs of the Italianate style. This is particularly noticeable in the towers, which are slimmer and more refined than those of Mentmore Towers, the other great Jacobethan house built in the same era. Barry produced an alternative design in a more purely Italian Renaissance style, which was rejected by Lord Carnarvon.Roger Dixon and Stefan Muthesius. Victorian Architecture. Thames and Hudson 1978, pp.39–40 The external walls are decorated with strapwork designs typical of Northern European Renaissance architecture. The Italian Renaissance theme is more evident in the interiors. In the saloon, in an attempt to resemble a medieval English great hall, Barry's assistant Thomas Allom introduced a Gothic influence evident in the points rather than curves of the arches, and the mock-hammerbeam roof. Although the exterior of the north, east and south sides were completed before the 3rd Earl died in 1849 and Sir Charles Barry died in 1860, the interior and the west wing (designated as servants' quarters) were far from complete. The 4th Earl turned to the architect Thomas Allom, who had worked with Barry, to supervise work on the interior of the castle, which was completed in 1878. The 1st Earl had his park laid out according to a design by Capability Brown in 1774–1777, moving the village in the process—the remains of the church of 1689 are at the north-west corner of the castle. The Lebanon Cedars are believed to be descended from seed brought to England from Lebanon by the 17th century seed collector Edward Pococke. The founding of Canada In the 1860s, the 4th Earl drafted the British North America Act of 1867 at the castle alongside the first Prime Minister of Canada John A Macdonald, George-Étienne Cartier and Alexander Tilloch Galt, who signed the visitor book in 1866. The 4th Earl presented the Act to Parliament in February 1867 and this led to the foundation of the present-day nation of Canada later that year. After the discovery of documents between him and John A. Macdonald, showing eight weeks of nearly daily correspondence, Janice Charette, the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, recognized the central role of the 4th Earl in the creation of Canada by planting a maple tree on the lawn on 11 January 2018. = 20th century = The castle became home to Egyptian artifacts after the 5th Earl, an enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist, sponsored the excavation of nobles' tombs in Deir el-Bahari (Thebes) in 1907.A letter from Gaston Maspero dated 14 October 1907, contained in the archives of Maspero in the library of the Institut de France says, \\"You have been kind enough to say to me that you could find a man who knows Egyptology to survey my works. Have you thought to anybody? I will leave the question of payment in your hands but I think I would prefer a compatriot\\" (Manuscripts 4009, folios 292–293). On 16 January 1909, Carter wrote to Maspero, \\"Just a word to tell you that Lord Carnarvon has accepted my conditions. He will be there (in Egypt) from 12 February to 20 March. I have to thank you again...\\" (Manuscripts 4009, folio 527) – from Elisabeth David. He later accompanied archaeologist Howard Carter during the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. During World War II the castle provided a home for dozens of evacuee children. The estate was the location of several crashes of allied aircraft, including a B-17 Flying Fortress parts of which are now in the possession of Highclere. In 1969, Henry Herbert, 7th Earl of Carnarvon, became racing manager to Elizabeth II.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, p. 698 The 7th Earl was \\"great friends\\" with the Queen; she was a \\"frequent visitor until his death in 2001\\". =21st century= In 2003, Lord and Lady Carnarvon undertook major roof repairs. In 2007, Lord and Lady Carnarvon created the Egyptian Exhibition, which lies in the cellars of the castle and tells the story of the discovery of Tutankhamen by the 5th Earl. By 2009, the castle was again in need of major repair, with only the ground and first floors remaining usable. Water damage had caused stonework to crumble and ceilings to collapse; at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable. The 8th Earl and his family were living in a \\"modest cottage in the grounds\\"; he said a lack of repair by his ancestors caused the castle's long term problems. As of 2009, repairs needed for the entire estate were estimated to cost around £12 million, £1.8 million of which was urgently needed just for the castle. From 2010, the castle was used as the main filming location for the ITV/PBS drama series Downton Abbey, which brought the castle international fame. As of late 2012, Lord and Lady Carnarvon said that an increase in the number of paying visitors allowed them to begin major repairs on both Highclere's turrets and its interior. The family attributed this increase in interest to the on-site filming of Downton Abbey. The family now live in Highclere Castle at various times throughout the year, but return to their cottage when the castle is open to the public. Highclere Park The parkland surrounding the castle is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and is listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The park is the earliest documented estate in Hampshire, having been given in 749 to the Church of Winchester as a deer park. In 1706, under the ownership of Robert Sawyer Herbert, the park became a Rococo landscape of walks. Then in 1770 it became a landscaped park designed by Capability Brown. In 1991 Highclere Park was registered as an SSSI. The park's listing as a SSSI is due to a mixture of habitats that contain many regional uncommon plants, and its diverse range of lichen. Details There are various follies on the estate. To the east of the house is the Temple of Diana, erected before 1743 with Ionic order columns from Devonshire House in Piccadilly, which had burnt in 1733, and remodeled by Barry.Colvin 1995, sv \\"Herbert, Henry, 9th Earl of Pembroke\\" p. 491. \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a folly about 60 feet high on Sidown Hill, built in 1749 by Hon. Robert Sawyer Herbert (d. 1769). Other 18th-century follies that can be found on the grounds of the estate include Milford Lake House and Jackdaw's Castle, both attributed to the architect-earl of Pembroke, brother of the owner,Colvin 1995 p. 491. and the Etruscan Temple. The hybrid holly Ilex x altaclerensis (Highclere holly) was developed here in about 1835 by hybridising the Madeiran Ilex perado (grown in a greenhouse) with the local native Ilex aquifolium. Restored Grade II* listed London Lodge (1793), brick but Coade stone dressed and wings (1840), (May 2014) The castle, Egyptian exhibition and gardens are open to the public during the summer months and at other times during the rest of the year.

Biba was started and primarily run by the Polish-born Barbara Hulanicki with help of her husband Stephen Fitz-Simon. Early years Biba's early years were rather humble, with many of the outfits being cheap and available to the public by mail order. The first store, in Abingdon Road in Kensington, was opened in September 1964. Biba's postal boutique had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink gingham dress with a hole cut out of the back of the neck with a matching triangular kerchief to readers of the Daily Mirror. The dress had celebrity appeal, as a similar dress had been worn by Brigitte Bardot. By the morning after the dress was advertised in the Daily Mirror, over 4,000 orders had been received. Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold. Hulanicki worked as a fashion illustrator after studying at Brighton Art College in the late 1950s. She married advertising executive Stephen Fitz-Simon and they soon opened a mail order clothing company that she named Biba's Postal Boutique. Biba was the nickname of her younger sister Biruta. Big Biba The former \\"Big Biba\\" building as it appeared circa 2006 In 1973 with the backing of Dorothy Perkins and British Land, the store moved to the seven-storey Derry & Toms department store, which immediately attracted up to a million customers weekly, making it one of the most visited tourist attractions in London. There were different departments, and each floor had its own theme, such as a children's floor, a floor for men, a book store, a food market, and a \\"home\\" floor which sold items such as wallpaper, paint, cutlery, soft furnishings and even statues. The overall design was produced by Whitmore-Thomas Partnership, run by artist/designers Steve Thomas (artist) and Tim Whitmore.http://www.alwynwturner.com/bigbiba/steven.html Each department had its own logo or sign, which was based on the Biba logo and had a picture describing the department. These were commissioned by Thomas and Whitmore and designed by Kasia Charko. The store had an Art Deco-interior reminiscent of the Golden Age of Hollywood and non-traditional displays, such as a giant Snoopy and his doghouse in the children's department, where merchandise based on the Peanuts comic strip was sold. The Biba Food Hall was also designed ingeniously, each part being aimed at one particular kind of product; a unit made to look like a dog (based on Hulanicki's own dog, a Great Dane named Othello) consisted of dog food; a huge baked beans tin can consisted of only tins of Baked beans; a can of \\"Warhol's Condensed Soup\\" etc., all foods having individual innovative units. Also at the new \\"Big Biba\\" was \\"The Rainbow Restaurant\\", which was located on the fifth floor of the department store and was destined to become a major hang-out for rock stars, but which was not solely the reserve of the elite. With all of these renovations and additions, Biba became known as a \\"theatre for fashion.\\" Also at the site was the Kensington Roof Gardens, which are still there today. Demise Big Biba was a huge responsibility in terms of expense and organization, but Hulanicki and Fitz felt they needed to \\"keep moving forward.\\" Because of this massive undertaking, Hulanicki said, \\"Every time I went into the shop, I was afraid it would be for the last time.\\" No one was aware of how serious the financial difficulties were going to be - and they proved too much for the new entrepreneurs; as a result Dorothy Perkins and Dennis Day came to save the day and bought 75% of Biba. This led to the formation of Biba Ltd, which meant that the brand and the store could now be properly financed. After disagreements with the Board over creative control, Hulanicki left the company and, shortly afterwards in 1975, Biba was closed by the British Land Company. The Dorothy Perkins shareholder decided that the Derry and Toms building that housed Big Biba was worth more than the ailing business itself. It sold the trademark to a consortium with no connection to Barbara Hulanicki, who opened a store in London on 27 November 1978, on two floors in Conduit Street in London's Mayfair. The store was not a success, and closed less than two years later. Relaunches There have been several attempts to relaunch Biba, the first occurring as soon after its closure as 1977. Another relaunch took place in the mid-1990s with Monica Zipper as head designer. Barbara Hulanicki has not been involved with any of these relaunches, and due to the use of Biba's logo and similar labels, these garments are easy to pass off as original vintage pieces. The Biba label was relaunched again in May 2006 under designer Bella Freud. Again, Biba's founder, Barbara Hulanicki, was not contacted for the relaunch and said it was 'very, very painful', believing that the new Biba would 'betray its heritage.' Freud's first collection Spring/Summer 2007 was unveiled at London Fashion Week in September 2006, and was criticised for straying from the original concept of low-priced clothes for teenagers, needing 'more polish', as they 'had a Biba flavour but lacked the retro details that the original Biba designs had.' Freud's second attempt, Autumn/Winter 2007 was also panned as 'the kind of thing that's already over- available in fast fashion chains.' Freud left the company after just 2 seasons in June 2007 to relaunch her own label. The Biba relaunch failed and the company went into administration for a second time in 2008. House of Fraser bought the company in November 2009 for a second relaunch by an in-house design team, announcing Daisy Lowe as the new face of the label. Hector Castro and a five-strong team were selected to replace Freud with couture hats created by Prudence Millinery. This relaunch was highly successful, outselling House of Fraser's other in-house brands in just two weeks of its launch, boosting its year end sales. Meanwhile, Hulanicki instead designed capsule collections for rival high-street company Topshop, and once again expressed her unhappiness with the relaunch, attacking the new Biba as \\"too expensive\\" and \\"for failing to reflect the original Biba style\\".

Often referred to as Captain Couch, he became famous for his singular skill at navigation of the Columbia Bar. He was a founder of Portland, Oregon. Biography He was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts. As a boy, he developed a desire to be a sailor and shipped on a voyage to the East Indies on the brig Mars. The Mars was owned by the uncle of Capt. George H. Flanders, with whom he would later go into business. The financial success of his first voyage led to his receiving a command of the Maryland in 1840 from John Newmarch Cushing, the father of diplomat Caleb Cushing. His first voyage in the Maryland was from Newburyport to the Columbia River, where he intended to exchange various goods for a cargo of salmon. At the time, the mouth of the Columbia was considered one of the most hazardous places for navigation on earth, because of the presence of a large sand bar. His attempt at a trading voyage was rebuffed by the Hudson's Bay Company, which controlled commerce in the Oregon Country. The Maryland was subsequently sent to the Hawaiian Islands, where it was sold. Couch returned to Massachusetts by finding passage on another vessel. Cushing did not attribute the failure of the trading voyage to Couch, however, and entrusted him with a command a second vessel Chenamos, named after a Native American chief along the Columbia with whom Couch had established friendly relations on his first voyage. He arrived in the Pacific Northwest in June 1842, navigating up the Columbia and the Willamette River to just below Oregon City, which was the largest settlement in the Oregon Country, which at the time was still disputed between the U.S. and Great Britain. Couch successfully established a general store and sent his brig home, remaining in the Oregon Country for five years. In 1845, during his stay in Oregon, he took a claim of land, now known as \\"Couch's Addition\\", in present-day Northwest Portland. The dispute between the U.S. and Great Britain over the Oregon Country, however, prevented him from perfecting the claim at the time. On March 4, 1846, Couch was appointed as treasurer of the Provisional Government of Oregon after Francis Ermatinger resigned. In 1847 he took passage back to Massachusetts via China, arriving in Newburyport in 1848. Couch's grave marker Later in 1848 he was convinced by a shipping firm in New York City to take command of another vessel, the Madonna, on a voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Captain Flanders, who had been for years master of vessels for the Cushing shipping company, agreed to serve as chief mate, and to assume command of the vessel so that Couch could remain in the Oregon Territory to discharge the cargo. The Madonna sailed from New York Harbor on January 12, 1849, and arrived in Portland the following August. His passengers included United States Senator Benjamin Stark. Following his instructions, Couch stayed in Oregon City while Flanders took the vessel on short trips between Portland and San Francisco. In 1850 Flanders and Couch began a trading and wharf business together. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 (in which the U.S. acquired the Oregon Country below the 49th parallel north) and the subsequent passage of the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 allowed Couch to perfect the land claim in Portland he had filed on his previous voyage to Oregon. From 1850 onward, he was a resident of Portland and became one of its most well- known and well-respected citizens. His residence was near present-day Union Station. John Couch died on January 19, 1870, in Portland and was buried at River View Cemetery in that city.John H Couch. Find-A-Grave, accessed November 5, 2007. Legacy The contribution to Portland for which he is most remembered today is the platting of his land claim in Northwest Portland, which stretched from Burnside Avenue north for , between Northwest 23rd Avenue and the Willamette River. In laying out the streets, Couch named the east-west thoroughfares in alphabetical order as A Street, B Street, etc. The streets were later renamed, retaining the alphabetic ordering, with \\"C Street\\" renamed \\"Couch Street\\" in his honor. \\"F Street\\" was named in honor of his business partner Flanders. Couch Park in the district is also named for him. The park was formerly the estate of Cicero Hunt Lewis, who married Couch's daughter Clementine. The area has become known more recently as the Alphabet District. The side-wheel river steamer John H. Couch, built in 1863, was named after John H. Couch.

This records that the foundations were laid in the 'Hare Year'. This corresponds to 763 or 775, with the completion and consecration of the main shrine taking place in the 'Sheep Year'. This is thought to correspond to 779. Dorje (1999), 172; Pasang, Wangdu, Hildegard Diemberger, and Per K. Sørensen.

The plan was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. The arrangement of the temple with a main shrine in the middle with fours shrines, each with a different color representing the cardinal points, and the whole surrounded by a circular wall, represents the Buddhist universe as three dimensional mandala. This idea is found in a number of temples of the period in South East Asia and East Asia such as the Tōdai-ji in Japan.Willis, Michael. \\"From World Religion to World Dominion: Trading, Translation and Institution-building in Tibet,\\" in Religions and Trade Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange between East and West, edited by Peter Wick and Volker Rabens (Leiden: Brill, 2013), 231-59. https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004255302_010 As at the Tōdai-ji, the Samye temple is dedicated to Vairocana. A seminal text of Vairocana is the Mahavairocana Tantra, composed in India in the seventh century and translated into Chinese and Tibetan soon after.Stephen Hodge, The Maha-Vairocana- Abhisambodhi Tantra, With Buddhaguya's Commentary (London RoutledgeCurzon, 2003).

One of the few documents belonging to the eighth century proper--but not carrying an actual date--is an inscription on the stone pillar (རྡོ་རིང་) preserved in front of the temple.Hugh Richardson.

For text and translations, see SIDDHAM, https://siddham.network/inscription/བསམ་ཡས།-bsam- yas-pillar-inscription/ This records the building of temples at Lhasa and Brag Mar (i.e. Samye), and that the king, ministers and other nobles made solemn oaths to preserve and protect the endowments of the monastery. The term used for these endowments is 'necessities' or 'meritorious gifts' (Tib. ཡོ་བྱད་ Sanskrit deyadharma).The term is explained in Willis, Michael. \\" Offerings to the Triple Gem: Texts, Inscriptions and Ritual Practice,\\" in Relics and Relic Worship in Early Buddhism, edited by Janice Stargardt (London, British Museum, 2018). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1249658 The Samye bell inscription A second dynastic record at Samye is on the large bronze bell in the entrance to the temple. This gives an account of the making of the bell by one of the queens of King Trisong Detsen. The text has been translated as follows: Doney, Lewis. (2014). Emperor, Dharmaraja, Bodhisattva? Inscriptions from the Reign of Khri Srong lde brtsan. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3560274. Also see Hugh Richardson. A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions (London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1985). \\"Queen Rgyal mo brtsan, mother and son, made this bell in order to worship the Three Jewels of the ten directions. And [they] pray that, by the power of that merit, Lha Btsan po Khri Srong lde brtsan, father and son, husband and wife, may be endowed with the harmony of the sixty melodious sounds, and attain supreme enlightenment.\\" Histories of Samye after the Dynastic Period According to post-dynastic accounts such as the Testament of Ba and other accounts, such as that compiled by Bsod-nams-rgyal-mtshan (1312-1374), the Indian monk Śāntarakṣita made the first attempt to construct the monastery while promoting his sutra-centric version of Buddhism.Sørensen, Per K. (1994). The Mirror Illuminating the Royal Genealogies: Tibetan Buddhist Historiography : An Annotated Translation of the XIVth Century Tibetan Chronicle : rGyal-rabs gsal- bai me-long. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3559806 Finding the Samye site auspicious, he set about to build a structure there. However, the building would always collapse after reaching a certain stage. Terrified, the construction workers believed that there was a demon or obstructive tulku in a nearby river making trouble. When Shantarakshita's contemporary Padmasambhava arrived from northern India, he was able to subdue the energetic problems obstructing the building of Samye. According to the 5th Dalai Lama,Pearlman, 2002: p.18 Padmasambhava performed the Vajrakilaya dance and enacted the rite of namkha to assist Trisong Detsen and Śāntarakṣita clear away obscurations and hindrances in the building of Samye: The abovementioned quotation makes reference to the relationship of the kīla to the stupa and mentions torma and namkha. Moreover, the building of Samye marked the foundation of the original school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Nyingma. This helps explain how Padmasambhava's Tantra-centric version of Buddhism gained ascendance over the sutra-based teaching of Śāntarakṣita. Pearlman succinctly charts the origin of the institution of the Nechung Oracle: The Great Debate One of the key events in the history of Samye was the debate between Buddhist schools hosted by Trisong Detsen in the 790s. Adamek (2007: p. 288) provides a circa five-year range when Moheyan of the East Mountain Teaching of Chan Buddhism and Kamalaśīla may have debated at Samye in Tibet: Broughton identifies the Chinese and Tibetan nomenclature of Moheyan's teachings and identifies them principally with the East Mountain Teaching: The great debate of the Council of Lhasa between the two principal debators or dialecticians, Moheyan and Kamalaśīla is narrated and depicted in a specific cham dance once held annually at Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai. Influences The 18th century Puning Temple built by the Qianlong Emperor of Qing China in Chengde, Hebei was modeled after Samye. Architectural features of the monastery and their history Samye Monastery is laid out on the shape of a giant mandala; in its center lies the main temple representing the legendary Mount Meru. Other buildings stand at the corners and cardinal points of the main temple, representing continents and other features of tantric Buddhist cosmology. In corners are 4 chörtens - white, red, green (or blue) and black. There are 8 main temples: * Dajor ling བརྡ་སྦྱོར་གླིང་ (brda sbyor gling) * Dragyar ling སྒྲ་བསྒྱར་གླིང་ (sgra bsgyar gling) * Bétsa ling བེ་ཙ་གླིང་ (be tsa gling) * Jampa ling བྱམས་པ་གླིང་ (byams pa gling) * Samten ling བསམ་གཏན་གླིང་ (bsam gtan gling) * Natsok ling སྣ་ཚོགས་གླིང་ (sna tshogs gling) * Düdül ling བདུད་འདུལ་གླིང་ (bdud 'dul gling) * Tamdrin ling རྟ་མགྲིན་གླིང་ (rta mgrin gling) The original buildings have long disappeared. They have been badly damaged several times — by civil war in the 11th century, fires in the mid 17th century and in 1826, an earthquake in 1816, and in the 20th century, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. As late as the late 1980s pigs and other farm animals were allowed to wander through the sacred buildings. Heinrich Harrer quoted his own words he said to the 14th Dalai Lama of what he saw in 1982 from his airplane en route to Lhasa, Each time it has been rebuilt, and today, largely due to the efforts of Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama from 1986 onward, it is again an active monastery and important pilgrimage and tourist destination.Dorje (1999), p. 173.

The Dukla Pass (, , , ; 502 m AMSL) is a strategically significant mountain pass in the Laborec Highlands of the Outer Eastern Carpathians, on the border between Poland and Slovakia (Lemkivshchyna) and close to the western border of Ukraine. The Dukla Pass is the lowest mountain pass in the Carpathian Mountains main range. Located south of Dukla in Poland and northeast of Prešov in Slovakia, the pass is acknowledged as an area where Eastern and Western Slavic cultures meet. In the 17th century, it was the haunt of a bandit and folk hero, Andrij Savka.

It was part of the Soviet East Carpathian Strategic Offensive that also included the Carpathian-Uzhgorod Offensive. The operation's primary goal, to provide support for the Slovak rebellion, was not achieved, but it concluded the full liberation of the Ukrainian SSR. The German resistance in the eastern Carpathian region was much harder than expected. The battle which began on 8 September would not see the Soviet forces on the other side of the pass until 6 October, and German forces would stop their heavy resistance in the region only around 10 October. Five days to Prešov turned into fifty days to Svidník alone with over 70,000 casualties on both sides. Prešov that was to be reached in six days remained beyond the Czechoslovaks' grasp for four months.Vladimir Baumgarten, GENERAL LUDVIK SVOBODA: COMMANDER OF THE 1ST CZECHOSLOVAK ARMY CORPS The battle would be counted among the most bloody in the entire Eastern Front and the history of Slovakia;BATTLE OF THE DUKLA PASS LECTURE one of the valleys in the pass near villages of Kapišová, Chyrowa, Iwla and Głojsce would become known as the Valley of Death.THE CARPATHO-DUKLA OPERATION Background In summer 1944, Slovaks rebelled against the Nazis and the Czechoslovak government appealed to Soviets for help. On 31 August, Soviet marshal Ivan Konev was ordered to prepare plans for an offensive to destroy Nazi forces in Slovakia. The plan was to push through the old Slovak-Polish border in the Carpathian Mountains via the Dukla Pass near Svidník to penetrate Slovakia proper.Battle for Dukla Pass In the meantime, however, the Germans had fortified the region, forming the Karpatenfestung (\\"Carpathian fortress\\") or Árpád Line. Battle The Soviet operation plan called for the Soviet forces to cross the pass and capture the town of Prešov within five days.FACTS ABOUT CARPATHIAN – DUKLA´S OPERATION The operation started on 8 September. It took the Soviets three days to take Krosno (it was captured on 11 September). One of the biggest battles in the pass took place on and around Hill 534 in the northwest from the town of Dukla; the battle to capture this hill lasted from 10–20 September, and during that period the control of the hill changed more than 20 times. The town of Dukla was seized on 21 September. The area of the former Czechoslovak state border—heavily fortified by the Germans—was captured on 6 October; it took almost a month for the Soviet forces to reach Slovakia. The Dukla operation did not end when the Soviets forced the pass. The combat zone shifted to Eastern Slovakia, with Soviet forces trying to outflank and push back the German forces, still strong and having many fortified positions. South of the pass and directly west of the village of Dobroslava lies an area that has come to be known as the \\"Valley of Death\\". Here Soviet and German armor clashed in a miniature reenactment of the great tank battle of Kursk. Soviet and Czechoslovak forces would enter Svidník on 28 October. A major German fortified position near the pass, Hill 532 \\"Obšár\\", would be secured as late as on 25 November 1944. Aftermath The Slovak National Uprising was mostly crushed by the time Soviet units secured Slovak territories; one of the main reasons for it was that the German resistance in the Dukla Pass was much heavier than expected. Another factor was that the Slovak insurgent forces failed to secure the other side of the pass, as planned by the Slovak and Soviet commanders during early preparations. In 1949, the Czechoslovak government erected a memorial and cemetery southeast of the Dukla border crossing, in Vyšný Komárnik, the first liberated village on the territory of (then) Czechoslovakia.

It was a crew-served, belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that served alongside the much lighter air-cooled Browning M1919. It was used at the battalion level, and often mounted on vehicles (such as a jeep). There were two main iterations: the M1917, which was used in World War I and the M1917A1, which was used thereafter. The M1917, which was used on some aircraft as well as in a ground role, had a cyclic rate of 450 rounds per minute. The M1917A1 had a cyclic rate of 450 to 600 rounds per minute.  Design and development  Val Browning, the inventor's son, demonstrates the M1917. US Army 2nd Lt. Valmore A. Browning firing a Browning machine gun. This gun was used in the Argonne Sector and is being tested by 2nd Lt. Browning at Thillombois, Meuse, France, 5 October 1918. Marines push back a Japanese counterattack during the Battle of Cape Gloucester in 1944. In 1900, John Moses Browning filed a patent for a recoil-powered automatic gun. Browning did not work on the gun again until 1910, when he built a water-cooled prototype of the 1900 design. Although the gun worked well, Browning improved the design slightly. Browning replaced side ejection with bottom ejection, added a buffer for smoother operation, replaced the hammer with a two piece firing pin, and some other minor improvements. The basic design of the gun was still the 1900 design. The Browning is a water-cooled heavy machine gun, though some experimental versions were made that did not use a water jacket; the air- cooled M1919 was later developed as a medium machine gun. Unlike many other early machine guns, the M1917 had nothing to do with Maxim's toggle lock design. At , it was much lighter than contemporary Maxim type guns such as the first German Maschinengewehr 08 (08/15 model: and the British Vickers machine gun, while still being highly reliable. The only similarities with the Maxim or Vickers are the principles of recoil operation, T-slot breechblock, \\"pull- out\\" belt feed, water cooling, and forward ejection. Its sliding-block locking mechanism saved weight and complexity, and was used in many previous Browning designs. The belt fed left-to-right, and the cartridges were stacked closer together than Maxim/Vickers (patterns copied by most guns later). The Army Ordnance Department showed little interest in machine guns until war was declared in April 1917. At that time, the U.S. arsenal included only 1,100 machine guns, and most of those were outmoded. The government asked several designers to submit weapons. Browning arranged a test at the Springfield Armory in May 1917. In the first test, the weapon fired 20,000 rounds with only a few malfunctions mostly related to poorly loaded cloth belts. The reliability was exceptional, so Browning fired another 20,000 rounds through the weapon with one broken part: a broken sear at about 39,500. The Ordnance Board was impressed, but was unconvinced that the same level of performance could be achieved in a production model. Consequently, Browning used a second gun that not only duplicated the original trial, but it also fired continuously for 48 minutes and 12 seconds (over 21,000 rounds). M1917 mounted on tripod The Army adopted the weapon as its principal heavy machine gun, utilizing the M1906 .30-06 cartridge with a 150-grain, flat-base bullet. Unfortunately, production was a problem. Several manufacturers started producing the gun, but they had to set up the assembly lines and tooling. By 30 June 1918, Westinghouse had made only 2,500 and Remington had made only 1,600. By the time of the Armistice, Westinghouse had made 30,150, Remington 12,000, and Colt 600. Until the start of World War I, the Army had used a variety of older machine guns, like the M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun \\"Potato Digger\\" (which Browning had also designed) and weapons like the Maxim Gun, the Benet–Mercie M1909, and the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. Although the Model 1917 was intended to be the principal US Army heavy machine gun in the war, the Army was, in fact, forced to purchase many foreign weapons—the French-produced Hotchkiss 8 mm machine gun was actually the most common heavy machine gun used by the American Expeditionary Force. In 1926, the Browning's rear sight was revised to incorporate scales for both the new M1 Ball (172-grain boat-tail bullet) and the M1906 (150-grain flat-base bullet) ammunition.Dunlap, Roy, Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 309 With M1 ball, the M1917 had a maximum range of about ; with M2 ammunition, about . The rear sight had a battle sight as well as a raised leaf-type sight suitable for employment against either ground or air targets.  Service  The M1917 saw limited service in the later days of World War I. Because of production delays, only about 1,200 Model 1917s saw combat in the conflict, and then only in the last 2½ months of the war. Some arrived too late for combat service. For example, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion, fighting as part of the Second Division did not exchange their Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns for Browning M1917 machine guns until 14 November, three days after the armistice.Curtis, Thomas J., History of the Sixth Machine Gun Battalion, Fourth Brigade, U.S. Marines, Second Division, and its Participation in the Great War, Neuwied on the Rhine, Germany, 1919, p. 59. The U.S. equipped about a third of the divisions sent to France; the others were equipped equally with Hotchkiss machine guns bought from the French or the British Vickers machine guns built by Colt in the US. Where the Model 1917 did see action, its rate of fire and reliability were highly effective. The M1917 weapon system was inferior to the Vickers and Hotchkiss guns in indirect fire applications because the British and French cartridges had about 50 percent longer range than the .30-06 service cartridge used in World War I., p. 23 A U.S. Marine firing Browning M1917 machine gun at Japanese at Battle of Iwo Jima A Browning M1917 in action during the Korean War. The Model 1917A1 was again used in the Second World War, and was primarily used with the M2 ball, tracer, and armor- piercing ammunition introduced just prior to the outbreak of hostilities. Some were supplied to the UK for use by the Home Guard since all production of the .303 Vickers were needed to resupply the equipment abandoned during the Fall of France. The M1917's weight and bulk meant that it was generally employed as a fixed defense or as a battalion or regimental support weapon. At the battle of Momote Airstrip in the Admiralties, the US Army's 5th Cavalry machine gunners killed several hundred Japanese in one night using their M1917 Brownings; one gun was left in position after the battle as a memorial to the desperate struggle.Dunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), p. 310 The Model 1917 was called to service again in the Korean War. On at least one occasion, U.S. soldiers in the Korean War urinated on the gun when water-cooling had failed in the frigid temperatures of the Korean winter.Lowenherz, David H. The 50 Greatest Letters from America's Wars. New York: Crown, 2002 p. 35. The Model 1917 was slowly phased out of military service in the late-1960s in favor of the much lighter M60 machine gun chambered in the new 7.62 mm NATO cartridge. Many of the 1917s were given to South Vietnam. The last ones in regular US service were on the machine gun infiltration course at Fort Benning, Georgia, where their sustained-fire capability was an advantage in long nights of shooting over the heads of low- crawling trainees. The gun did continue to see service in some Third World armies well into the latter half of the 20th century. Some are still in use today by irregular military forces because the water cooled barrel allows for long periods of sustained fire.  M1917 and M1917A1 ammunition chests  The machine gun used a wooden ammunition chest that carried 250 rounds. The early M1917 model had an angled corner and a leather strap handle on top. The later M1917A1 model had a square corner and a cloth strap handle on top. The wooden ammunition belt chest was replaced during WWII by the expendable metal box ammunition M1 adopted 6 May 1942. On 20 June 1945, a modified version known as the M1A1 was adopted. The M1A1 had a spring-loaded catch to fasten it to the M1917A1 tripod more securely and provide a better watertight seal. In the late-1940s the M19 box replaced the earlier metal M1 and M1A1 boxes, and a modified version known as the M19A1 appeared in the early-1950s and continues in use today.Ordnance committee minutes number 18105, April 22, 1942  Variants  = US military variants =  M1917  The original gun suffered from a weakness related to the design of the receiver. Under field conditions, the bottom plates, which were dovetailed into the gun's two side plates, tore out. An early fix was to attach a roughly horseshoe-shaped steel bracket around the rearmost part of the receiver. A later fix was to rivet \\"stirrups\\" (right-angled steel pieces) to the bottom and side plates. The stirrup fix became the standard reinforcement until a more permanent fix for the problem was developed. Another reported problem was bulging in the side plates, which was probably caused by stresses put into the side plates when hammering the dovetails closed. The 1917 also had a simple sliding safety that blocked the trigger when moved to the far right position. These were removed as part of post-war refurbishment.  M1917A1  An M1917A1 in Hackenberg Museum (Veckring, Moselle, France) In the 1930s, the Ordnance Department developed a new bottom plate, which had side flanges that came up on both sides of the receiver and were attached by rivets. This fixed the problem of the original bottom plates, and became standard for all M1917- and M1919-series machine guns. While the US Arsenal at Rock Island was the leader in converting the existing stocks of M1917-series guns over to 1917A1 configuration, other arsenals took part. In addition, the rear sights were updated for the new ammunition and were changed to yards from meters, and also did away with the World War I multiple-aperture disk on the rear sight. The top covers also had a stronger feed pawl pivot arm installed, so the gun could handle the stress of pulling an ammunition belt from the ground. Rock Island Arsenal also developed an all-steel water jacket that went into production around 1943; this was stronger than the earlier brass-capped jackets. These steel components were interchangeable with the earlier brass ones to allow for repair of worn or damaged water jacket components. Other changes were implemented, some during the war, but not all M1917s received these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919-series guns. While the World War I–pattern top cover hinge pin appears to have been retained on most converted M1917s, the later-production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover hinge pin that allowed the top cover to remain open, lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919-series guns.  M1918  Air-cooled aircraft version of the M1917. Developed during the First World War, the M1918 arrived too late, but became the dominant weapon of its type in US service until the development of the M1919. It features a heavier barrel, but lighter barrel jacket as compared to the M1917. A sub-variant, the M1918M1, was developed as a flexible version of the fixed M1918. = International variants & designations = The M1917 pattern has been used in countries the world over in a variety of forms. In certain cases a new designation was applied by the user nation.  FN30  From 1930, Belgian Fabrique Nationale produced air-cooled and water-cooled versions of the M1917, chambered in various calibers for domestic and export use.  Ksp m/14-29 and ksp m/36  Kulspruta m/14-29 was the Swedish designation for the licensed M1917A1, produced by Carl Gustafs Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna, for infantry support. The main differences was that it was chambered in the standard caliber 6.5×55mm, had spade-grips and used the cooling jacket and tripod of the m/14 (Schwarzlose) tripod, the machine gun the Ksp m/14-29 replaced. The reason for adoption of the Browning was cost: 50 machine guns using the Browning mechanism could be made for the same price as 30 Schwarzlose, which was discovered during the manufacture of Kulspruta m/22. The 6.5mm bullet was found to be too light for long-range fire support and anti-aircraft use, so in 1932 the heavier 8×63mm patron m/32 cartridge was developed. As this resulted in a heavier recoil, a spring-loaded cradle replaced the backplate with a heavily spring-loaded buffer that acted as an extension of the standard Browning recoil buffer. This also replaced the regular spade-grips with the ones integrated in the cradle. The cradle, now part of the weapon, would then be hooked onto a tripod m/36. This tripod featured, beside a 5×25 power optical sight, advanced elevation and traverse controls. The unprecedented recoil control and steadiness of the tripod made Dolf Goldsmith remark that this arrangement “was undoubtedly the most accurate long-range rifle-caliber machine gun ever made”.Swedish Kulspruta m/36, forgottenweapons.com For anti-aircraft purposes, a double cradle was made to hold a matching pair of m/36s. The right gun, lacking sights altogether, was fed from the right, while the left gun, with iron sights complemented with an AA sight ring, was fed from left. The cocking handles were located between the guns, while safeties and triggers were individual for left and right. The special AA tripod had elongated legs and chains to either secure the tripod or hang weights on it for extra stability. These double cradles were also used as standard defense, mounted on a ring on the cab roof, on terrain vehicles and armored troop carriers like Terrängbil m/42 KP. The latter was used with good effect in the Congo Crisis in the early-1960s. Until 1966, the m/14-29 and m/36 machine guns could use both the 6.5mm and the 8 mm ammunition. Converting between the two was a matter of changing barrels, cartridge stops, and bolts. In 1966, most were converted to 7.62×51mm NATO. Some old models were retained in training use to use up the stores of obsolete ammunition. After the stocks were expended in the 1970s, all guns were re-barreled to 7.62mm NATO.O. Janson The Swedish machineguns before 1950 The weapons were finally taken out of service in the 1990s.  Ckm wz.30  The Ckm wz.30 was an unlicensed Polish-built clone of the commercial MG38 chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser. The modifications included new iron sights (V-notch rather than loophole), lengthened butt handle, lengthened barrel, simplified rifle lock for easier exchange of used-up barrels and better handling, mounting adapted for both anti-personnel and AA fire and sights and grips adapted to suit both purposes. Roughly 8,000 were built by Państwowa Fabryka Karabinów.  M/29  Narvik front, 1940 Norwegian designation for the Colt MG 38 (mentioned in the following section) in , used as the standard heavy machine gun and anti- aircraft weapon for the Norwegian Army from 1929 to 1940. The M/29 replaced the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun in Norwegian service. In all, 1,800 M/29s were in Norwegian service by the time of the 9 April 1940 German invasion. The M/29 saw service in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, often deployed as the only heavy weapon of Norwegian front line units. = Commercial variants = Colt commercially produced the M1917 under several names: *Colt Model of 1919 (not to be confused with the air-cooled M1919 Browning machine gun) *Colt Model of 1924. *Colt Model of 1928.

Platinum was initially used as the catalyst for this reaction; however, as it is susceptible to reacting with arsenic impurities in the sulfur feedstock, vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) is now preferred. History This process was patented in 1831 by British vinegar merchant Peregrine Phillips. In addition to being a far more economical process for producing concentrated sulfuric acid than the previous lead chamber process, the contact process also produces sulfur trioxide and oleum. In 1901 Eugen de Haën patented a process involving vanadium oxides. This process was superseded by a process invented by two chemists of BASF in 1914.  Process  The process can be divided into five stages: # Combining of sulfur and oxygen (O2) to form sulfur dioxide # Purifying the sulfur dioxide in a purification unit # Adding an excess of oxygen to sulfur dioxide in the presence of the catalyst vanadium pentoxide at 450 °C and 1-2 atm # The sulfur trioxide formed is added to sulfuric acid which gives rise to oleum (disulfuric acid) # The oleum is then added to water to form sulfuric acid which is very concentrated. #As this process is an exothermic reaction so the temperature should be as low as possible. The yield has been found to be maximum at about 410 - 450° C. Purification of the air and sulfur dioxide (SO2) is necessary to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e. removing catalytic activities). The gas is then washed with water and dried with sulfuric acid. To conserve energy, the mixture is heated by exhaust gases from the catalytic converter by heat exchangers. Sulfur dioxide and dioxygen then react as follows: :2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g) : ΔH = -197 kJ·mol−1 According to the Le Chatelier's principle, a lower temperature should be used to shift the chemical equilibrium towards the right, hence increasing the percentage yield. However too low of a temperature will lower the formation rate to an uneconomical level. Hence to increase the reaction rate, high temperatures (450 °C), medium pressures (1-2 atm), and vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) are used to ensure an adequate (>95%) conversion. The catalyst only serves to increase the rate of reaction as it does not change the position of the thermodynamic equilibrium. The mechanism for the action of the catalyst comprises two steps: # Oxidation of SO2 into SO3 by V5+: #: 2SO2 + 4V5+ + 2O2− → 2SO3 + 4V4+ # Oxidation of V4+ back into V5+ by dioxygen (catalyst regeneration): #: 4V4+ + O2 → 4V5+ + 2O2− Hot sulfur trioxide passes through the heat exchanger and is dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 in the absorption tower to form oleum: : H2SO4 (l) + SO3 (g) → H2S2O7 (l) Note that directly dissolving SO3 in water is impractical due to the highly exothermic nature of the reaction. Acidic vapor or mists are formed instead of a liquid. Oleum is reacted with water to form concentrated H2SO4. :H2S2O7 (l) + H2O (l) → 2 H2SO4 (l)  Purification unit  This includes the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, drying tower, arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulfur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, it must be purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulfuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulfur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulfur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying tower, sulfuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.  Double contact double absorption  The next step to the contact process is double contact double absorption (DCDA). In this process the product gases (SO2) and (SO3) are passed through absorption towers twice to achieve further absorption and conversion of SO2 to SO3 and production of higher grade sulfuric acid. SO2-rich gases enter the catalytic converter, usually a tower with multiple catalyst beds, and are converted to SO3, achieving the first stage of conversion. The exit gases from this stage contain both SO2 and SO3 which are passed through intermediate absorption towers where sulfuric acid is trickled down packed columns and SO3 reacts with water increasing the sulfuric acid concentration. Though SO2 too passes through the tower it is unreactive and comes out of the absorption tower. This stream of gas containing SO2, after necessary cooling is passed through the catalytic converter bed column again achieving up to 99.8% conversion of SO2 to SO3 and the gases are again passed through the final absorption column thus resulting not only achieving high conversion efficiency for SO2 but also enabling production of higher concentration of sulfuric acid. The industrial production of sulfuric acid involves proper control of temperatures and flow rates of the gases as both the conversion efficiency and absorption are dependent on these.

His father was the Vibhandak Rishi, and his mother was a celestial paramour. According to another legend, he was believed to have been born of a doe and from the slight protrusion of his forehead. According to legend, his father was seduced by the celestial danseuse Urvasi by order of Indra, the king of gods, who feared the yogic powers gained out of penance by the rishi could prove fatal to the very existence of heavenly world. The father was seduced and out of his relation with the danseuse was born Rishyasringa. Rishishringa entice girls sent by king lomapada. However, immediately after the child was born, Urvashi, after completing the duty she was sent for, left the young born child and her lover and made her way to the heavens.

Despite his fear of the power and anger of the boy's father, the king sends young women to introduce the boy into normal society. This was successfully done by Vaishali, Rishyasringa uses his powers, the kingdom receives bountiful rains and Rishyasringa marries Shanta. Much of the story is taken up by accounts of the feelings of the young man as he becomes aware of women for the first time. In another version of the story, the forest in which the boy is brought up is part of Anga. The boy's upbringing without knowledge of women is itself the cause of the troubles of the kingdom. The story can be found in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. According to the Ramayana, Ekashringa was the chief priest when the king Dasharatha performed a yajna to beget progeny, and Rama, Bharata, and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born. Rishyasringa perform yagna for Dasratha. Buddhist versions of the story =Naḷinikā Jātaka= Story of Rishi Sringa Reverse Shows Woman Carrying Wine Pot and Holding Bunch of Grapes - Circa 2nd Century CE - Bhuteshwar Mathura Museum. The Naḷinikā Jātaka (Jā 526) introduces a past life of the Buddha, a sage, living alone in the Himālayas. There is semen in the urine he passes, a deer who eats the grass in that place gets pregnant from it. A human boy named Isisiṅga (Pali) is later born to the deer and he grows up in complete seclusion from mankind, and most importantly, from womankind.He even don't know the difference in the body and appearance of the two. The boy's ascetic power becomes so great that it disturbs the god Sakka, the lord of heaven, who causes a drought to occur in the country and blames it on the boy. He then convinces the King to send his daughter to seduce him and to break the austerity of the young seer and to reduce his ascetic power. The King and his daughter accept Sakka's reasoning and in good faith – and for the benefit of the country – agree to be the part of the plot. The girl dresses up as an ascetic and while the father is away gathering roots and fruits in the forest, she manages to seduce the boy, who has never seen a woman before. Through their revelling, the boy does indeed lose his powers, after which the girl departs. When his father returns, the infatuated boy informs him of the girl, only to be instructed and rebuked by his father. He then repents for his actions. =Alambusā Jātaka= Jātaka 523, the Alambusā Jātaka, recounts a similar story. Sakka chooses a heavenly nymph to seduce the ascetic. The outcome is the same: the sage is seduced, repents and Sakka is thwarted. In response, he grants a boon to the seductress. The story also appears in the Mahāvastu (Jones' translation pp. 139–147), but Ekaśr̥ṅga, as he is known here, is the Bodhisattva, and Nalinī is a past life of Yaśodharā. A major variation in this version of the story is Ekaśr̥ṅga's ignorance of his marriage to the girl. He succumbs to worldly responsibilities, eventually becoming king and fathering 32 children before retiring again to the forest and regaining his former powers. Present day The Ascetic Rishyashringa at His Hermitage There is a temple of rishyashringa named 'Chehni fort' situated in Banjar tehsil of kullu District Himachal pradesh.In Banjar valley Rishyashringa is called as \\"Shringa Rishi\\" by the locals. Idol of Shringa Rishi with goddess Shanta resides in the temple. This place is about 50 km from Kullu. Lord Shringa is the presiding deity of this secluded valley named Banjar. There is also a belief that sage Rishyashringa was from a place near Sringeri in Karnataka. There is an ancient big temple nearby which is believed to be the place where he lived before moving to Ayodhya.

Stanford's team name is \\"Cardinal\\", referring to the vivid red color (not the common songbird as at several other schools), and the university does not have an official mascot. The Tree, in various versions, has been called one of America's most bizarre and controversial college mascots. The tree regularly appears at the top of Internet \\"worst mascot\\" lists but has also appeared on at least one list of top mascots. History The Tree is a member of the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) and appears at football games, basketball games, and other events where the band performs. The \\"Tree\\" is representative of El Palo Alto, the tree that appears on both the official seal of the University and the municipal seal of Palo Alto, Stanford's nearby city. From 1930 until 1972, Stanford's sports teams had been known as the Indians, and, during the period from 1951 to 1972, Prince Lightfoot (portrayed by Timm Williams, a member of the Yurok tribe) was the official mascot. But in 1972, Native American students and staff members successfully lobbied University President Richard Lyman to abolish the \\"Indian\\" name along with what they had come to perceive as an offensive and demeaning mascot. Stanford's teams reverted unofficially to the name \\"Cardinal\\", the color that had represented the school before 1930. From 1972 until 1981, Stanford’s official nickname was the Cardinal, but, during this time, there was debate among students and administrators concerning what the mascot and team name should be. A 1972 student referendum on the issue was in favor of restoring the Indian, while a second 1975 referendum was against. The 1975 vote included new suggestions, many alluding to the industry of the school's founder, railroad tycoon Leland Stanford: the Robber Barons, the Sequoias, the Trees, the Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, and the Huns. The Robber Barons won, but the university's administration refused to implement the vote. In 1978, 225 varsity athletes started a petition for the mascot to be the griffin, but this campaign also failed. Finally, in 1981, President Donald Kennedy declared that all Stanford athletic teams would be represented exclusively by the color cardinal. However, in 1975, the band had performed a series of halftime shows that facetiously suggested several other new mascot candidates it considered particularly appropriate for Stanford, including the Steaming Manhole, the French Fry, and the Tree. The Tree ended up receiving so much positive attention that the band decided to make it a permanent fixture, and the Tree came to be embraced by the Stanford community at large. The original Tree costume was conceived and constructed by Christine Hutson. When she left Stanford, she passed along the costume and the role of the Tree to a conga drum player in the band, Robert David Siegel. In the spring of 1987, Paul Kelly wrote a column in the Stanford Daily, lamenting the lame stature of the school's mascot since it was, at that time, just kind of a big green dress. Responding to the dare, the drum major and others responded by having \\"Tree Tryouts\\" at the Shak at 2am on a Saturday morning. Kelly was the only one who showed up. They put a song on the tape while the keg flowed freely. Kelly made a fool of himself dancing. At 5am, approximately 25 band members were outside his dorm with \\"All I Ever..\\" They gave Kelly one week to prepare a costume before a men's home basketball game. Kelly spent the following summer designing and building the first true Stanford Tree complete with surf shorts and white tails (as a tribute to the drum major Jimmy Jet). The Tree at the Big Game, 1987 At the 1987 Big Game, Kelly was attacked by several Cal students who had run onto the field during the halftime show. Barely escaping, Kelly led them to the drum section where all three Berkeley students were tackled. \\"The staffers, many still in their grounds-crew uniforms, sit in neat rows, attentive if slightly bemused. Then the trombones kick in, and the audience is blasted back in its chairs like jet pilots. Before the first song is over, a few heads are starting to bob and feet are moving to the rhythm, but all eyes are on The Band's bizarre mascot. The Tree, a nine-foot pillar of bark and foliage – with legs and a maniacal smile – looks like a character from some low rent Disneyland. He ricochets around the stage and into the audience with alarming abandon, rarely quite vertical but never entirely horizontal.\\" – excerpt from \\"Band on the Run\\", Rolling Stone, Issue 509, Sept 24, 1987 Due to the heightened visibility of the Stanford Tree, physical altercations with Cal students became common place and part of the assignment. At the annual Battle of the Bands at UC Davis, Kelly left the Tree costume on the bus after a long day in the sun, and Cal students broke into the bus and stole the costume. The following week, the band received a ransom note offering the Tree in exchange for Oski the Bear (which had been stolen from the UCB Student Union the year before). The band did not think this trade was worth it. The tradition of building a new costume was born and every year since then, the Band and their many admirers now expect the Tree to be reinvented every fall. With more exposure, the decision about who would become Tree became more rigorous, and the band had to adopt a more formal selection process. Today's Tree candidate must go through \\"grueling and humiliating physical and mental challenges\\" to show that he or she has sufficient chutzpah to be the Tree. During \\"Tree Week,\\" candidates have been known to perform outrageous, unwise, and often dangerous stunts in order to impress the Tree selection committee, so much so that the university has felt the need to prohibit certain types of audition activities over the years. The Stanford Tree entering Stanford Stadium in November 2006 The Tree's costume, which is created anew each year by the incumbent Tree, is a prominent target for pranksters from rival schools, in particular from Stanford's Bay Area nemesis, the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). This tendency for the Tree to come to harm at the hands of Cal fans was showcased in the run-up to the 1998 Big Game. An anonymous coterie of fraternity brothers from Cal known as the Phoenix Five stole the costume and held it \\"hostage\\" for two weeks until it was turned in to the UC Berkeley chancellor's office and returned to Stanford by the UC Police. In 1996 two Cal students emerged shirtless from the stands at Memorial Stadium at the Big Game during halftime and tackled the tree, breaking branches and eliciting cheers from the Cal alumni prior to being handcuffed and led away. The most recent theft of the Tree was during the 2012 basketball game against Cal, when a member of the Cal Band entered LSJUMB's bus and removed the mascot. Older bandsmen quickly sent the Tree outfit back that evening and no charges were pressed. Violence and absurd levels of prankery have been a two-way street between Cal and Stanford. A few years earlier, during an ESPN-televised timeout during a February 1995 basketball game at Maples Pavilion, the Stanford Tree and Cal's mascot Oski got into a fistfight in front of the Stanford student section. The Oski costume's headpiece was forcefully removed by the Tree during the scuffle, an act of special significance because Cal has taken great pains to keep its Oski costume wearers' identities secret since the 1940s. A spate of recent troubles has brought the Tree even more notoriety in college sports circles. In February 2006, then-Tree Erin Lashnits was suspended until the end of her term as the Tree after her blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.157 (almost twice the legal driving limit in California) during a men's basketball game between Stanford and Cal. UC Berkeley police observed her drinking from a flask during the game and cited her for public drunkenness after she failed a breathalyzer test. In August 2006, the NCAA fined Stanford University for what it termed \\"multiple violations of tournament policies\\" after an on-court altercation involving Tree mascot Tommy Leep and tournament officials as the Stanford women's basketball team participated in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in Denver. The Tree was subsequently banned from the 2007 Women's Tournament.https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Tree-ruled-over-the-top-NCAA- fines-Stanford-for-2513191.php  List of Stanford Trees  The following people have portrayed the Stanford Tree.https://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/stanford/thetree.html * 1975–1977: Chris Hutson * 1977–1978: Robert David Siegel * 1978–1980: Meredith Fondahl * 1980–1981: Judy Mischel * 1981–1982: Eliza Pond * 1982–1984: Pat Leckman * 1984–1985: Mardi Dier * 1985–1986: Mary Boyce * 1986–1987: Carole Sams Hoemeke * 1987–1988: Paul Brendan Kelly III * 1988–1989: William Washington Thomas III * 1989–1990: Gil Blank * 1990–1991: Todd David * 1991–1992: Pete Huyck * 1992–1993: Greg Siegel * 1993–1994: Charles Goodan * 1994–1995: Ari Benjamin Mervis * 1995–1996: Christopher Jeffrey Bonzon * 1996–1997: Christopher Anselmo Cary * 1997–1998: Matthew James Merrill * 1998–1999: Christopher Matthew Henderson * 1999–2000: Evan Fletcher Meagher * 2000–2001: Alexandra Mary Newell * 2001–2002: Charles Monroe Armstrong * 2002–2003: Andrew Daniel Parker * 2003–2004: William Robert Rothacker, Jr. * 2004–2005: Daniel Isaac Salier–Hellendag * 2005–2006: Erin Wright Lashnits * 2006–2007: Thomas Elwood Leep * 2007–2008: John Henrique Whipple * 2008–2009: Patrick Jonathan Fortune * 2009–2010: Jonathan Patrick Strange * 2010–2011: Benjamin Cortes Fernando De La Guerra * 2011–2012: Michael Benjamin Samuels * 2012–2013: Nicoletta von Heidegger * 2013–2014: Calvin Studebaker * 2014–2015: William Funk * 2015–2016: Sarah Young * 2016–2017: Sam Weyen * 2017–2018: Anaxi Mars * 2018–2019: Dahkota Brown * 2019–2020: Caroline Christina Kushel * 2020–2022: Grayson Armour  References  Tree Pac-12 Conference mascots ","title":"Stanford Tree"},{"id":"1205706","text":"Yellow Mama is the electric chair of the U.S. state of Alabama. It was used for executions from 1927 to 2002. First installed at Kilby State Prison in Montgomery, Alabama, the chair acquired its yellow color (and from it, the nickname \\"Yellow Mama\\") when it was painted with highway-line paint from the adjacent State Highway Department lab. The chair was built by a British inmate in 1927 and was first used to execute Horace DeVauhan in that year. The last person put to death in Yellow Mama was Lynda Lyon Block, who was executed in 2002. The chair has since been stored in an attic above the execution chamber at the Holman Correctional Facility. Background information Before 1923, executions in Alabama were the responsibility of the counties and were carried out by hanging in private gallows. In 1923, legislation provided for state- performed executions by electrocution. At Kilby Prison in Montgomery, a special room was designated for this purpose. Inmate Ed Mason, a master carpenter by trade who was serving 60 years for theft and grand larceny, built Yellow Mama. The electric chair remained there until 1970, when it was moved to Holman Prison. The first execution by electrocution in Alabama was performed in the Yellow Mama on April 8, 1927. Between 1930 and 1976 there were 135 executions completed using Yellow Mama. In 1983, the State Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of using lethal injections in place of electrocutions. However, the bill failed. In 1997, a bill was discussed which would allow the condemned prisoners to be executed by the option of lethal injection.  Problems with Yellow Mama  Alabama has experienced several problematic executions involving the chair. On April 22, 1983, John Louis Evans, New York Times April 23, 1983 the first post-Furman prisoner to be executed by the state, was hit with an initial jolt of electricity, which lasted 30 seconds. Evans’ body tensed up, causing the electrode on his left leg to snap off. Soon smoke and flames were shooting out from under the hood that covered his head. When two physicians entered the death chamber they found him still alive. Ignoring Evans' lawyer's plea, a third jolt of electricity was applied and he died. The execution took a total of 14 minutes and his body was left charred and smoldering. In 1989 the state executed Horace Dunkins, who had an IQ of 69 and was convicted of murdering Lynn McCurry. In Dunkins’ execution the first jolt of electricity only knocked him unconscious. Charles Jones, the warden at the time, said that because the jacks connecting the electricity to the chair had been reversed, there was not enough voltage to kill him on the first try. Therefore, it took 19 minutes for Dunkins to die.  Today  Yellow Mama is now stored in an attic above the execution chamber at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. The last execution to occur using it was that of Lynda Lyon Block on May 10, 2002. On July 1 of that year, a revision to Alabama's death penalty went into effect allowing for an inmate to choose execution by either lethal injection or electrocution. Yellow Mama remains in storage in the event a future death row inmate elects to have the death sentence carried out by electrocution.  Cultural references  Dale Watson and Will Kimbrough each have created songs about Yellow Mama.

The most restrictive definition limits western Montana only to the parts of the state west of the Continental Divide. Other common definitions add in the mountainous areas east of the divide including Beaverhead, Gallatin, Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, Madison, and Park Counties. The region is sometimes considered to be part of the Inland Northwest. Geography, biomes and climate Glacier National Park is located in Western Montana along the Canada–US border Western Montana is dominated by the Rocky Mountains. Most of Western Montana is covered in forest, prominent species being Ponderosa pine, aspen, and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Common fauna include the black bear, moose, elk, and coyote. The grizzly bear lives in Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and surrounding areas. Precipitation is lower in the valleys, which are mostly semiarid and receive 8 to 25 inches of precipitation, largely in snow, and higher in the mountains, some areas of which qualify as temperate rainforest, especially in the northwest around Glacier National Park and Libby. Winters are cold, sometimes bitterly cold, and summers are warm. History Western Montana was inhabited by the Salish, Kootenai, Shoshone, Flathead, and Kalispel people. In the late 19th century non-indigenous people arrived and established mines and additional cities in the mountains and valleys. Gold was discovered in Last Chance Gulch in the 1860s and soon the city of Helena was born. Today Helena is the State capitol of Montana. Helena still has much of the charm of a 19th-century mining town. Many of the old buildings have been renovated, and hundreds of 19th-century Victorian homes and mansions fill Helena's old neighborhoods. Helena is one of the best-preserved mining towns on the Western frontier. Copper was discovered In Butte and the surrounding areas in the 1870s. Vast quantities of copper were mined, leaving behind the largest Superfund cleanup site in the history of the nation. Copper is still mined at the continental pit in Butte. Missoula is the largest city in Western Montana and the second-largest in the state after Billings. Western Montana, though faring better than much of the nation, was the portion of the state hit hardest by the current economic downturn. The closing of Smurfit-Stone Container in 2009 alone caused the loss of over 2000 jobs through 2012. Much of western Montana has felt the effects of a housing bust as well.

Printed three years after his treatise on the discovery of logarithms and in the same year as his death, it describes three devices to aid arithmetic calculations. The devices themselves don't use logarithms, rather they are tools to reduce multiplication and division of natural numbers to simple addition and subtraction operations. The first device, which by then was already popularly used and known as Napier's bones, was a set of rods inscribed with the multiplication table. Napier coined the word rabdology (from Greek ῾ραβδoς [rhabdos], rod and λoγoς [logos] calculation or reckoning) to describe this technique. The rods were used to multiply, divide and even find the square roots and cube roots of numbers. The second device was a promptuary (Latin promptuarium meaning storehouse) and consisted of a large set of strips that could multiply multidigit numbers more easily than the bones. In combination with a table of reciprocals, it could also divide numbers. The third device used a checkerboard like grid and counters moving on the board to perform binary arithmetic. Napier termed this technique location arithmetic from the way in which the locations of the counters on the board represented and computed numbers. Once a number is converted into a binary form, simple movements of counters on the grid could multiply, divide and even find square roots of numbers. Of these devices, Napier's bones were the most popular and widely known. In fact, part of his motivation to publish the treatise was to establish credit for his invention of the technique. The bones were easy to manufacture and simple to use, and several variations on them were published and used for many years. The promptuary was never widely used, perhaps because it was more complex to manufacture, and it took nearly as much time to lay out the strips to find the product of numbers as to find the answer with pen and paper. Location arithmetic was an elegant insight into the simplicity of binary arithmetic, but remained a curiosity probably because it was never clear that the effort to convert numbers in and out of binary form was worth the trouble. An interesting tidbit is this treatise contains the earliest written reference to the decimal point (though its usage would not come into general use for another century.) The computing devices in Rabdology were overshadowed by his seminal work on logarithms as they proved more useful and more widely applicable. Nevertheless, these devices (as indeed are logarithms) are examples of Napier's ingenious attempts to discover easier ways to multiply, divide and find roots of numbers. Location arithmetic in particular foreshadowed the ease of and power of mechanizing binary arithmetic, but was never fully appreciated.

It is the largest energy company in Denmark. The company adopted its current name on 6 November 2017. As of 2020, the company is the world's largest developer of offshore wind power, accounting for 29% of global installed capacity and producing 88% of their energy from renewable sources. The company has a goal of net-zero generation by the year 2025 and no carbon emissions by 2040. History Ørsted has its origin in the Danish state-owned company Dansk Naturgas A/S. The company was founded in 1972 to manage gas and oil resources in the Danish sector of the North Sea. After some years, the company was renamed to Dansk Olie og Naturgas A/S (DONG), meaning Danish Oil and Natural Gas. At the beginning of the decade of the 2000s, DONG started to expand itself into the electricity market by taking long positions in electricity companies. In 2005, DONG acquired and merged Danish electrical power producers Elsam and Energi E2 and public utility (electricity distribution) companies NESA, Københavns Energi and Frederiksberg Forsyning. The result of the merger was the creation of DONG Energy. The merger was approved by the European Commission on 14 March 2006. In 2002, one of predecessors of DONG Energy named Elsam installed the 160 MW Horns Rev offshore wind farm, which was the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the world.Horns Rev I Offshore Wind Farm, Denmark Power Technology.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average – across all demographics.\\" History The Adventist University of the Philippines was established by Seventh-day Adventist Church missionaries. In 1915, A. G. Daniels visited the Philippine Islands and laid plans for the organization of an academic institution. Daniels was followed by L. V. Finster who reported that in 1916, I. A. Steinel and O. F. Sevrens and their families had arrived to supervise the building of the Philippine Seventh-day Adventist Academy on a five-acre land located along Calle Luna in Pasay then part of the province of Rizal. The school formally opened on June 12, 1917, with 24 boys and 12 girls. The school building had classrooms on the first floor and a dormitory for the boys on the second floor. The girls stayed in an old mixed-material house which already stood on the land. In 1925, at the Spring Council of the Far Eastern Division, it was voted that the academy be authorized to carry fourteen grades, adding one grade each year towards 1927, and that the name be changed to Philippine Junior College. Elder W. B. Amundsen was elected principal in 1927 until 1931. At the end of 1927, 26 hectares of land was purchased in Baesa, Caloocan, then part of the Rizal province, to accommodate the increasing enrollment. Prof. L. M. Stump, president of the college in 1931 directed the construction of the buildings. In 1932 the school moved to Baesa Campus. In that same year FED permitted the junior college’s elevation to a senior one naming it Philippine Union College (PUC). The school song, “Shine on Forever” was composed in 1933. The growing enrollment inspired the administration to purchase a bigger property which comprises 165 hectares of land located at Putting Kahoy, Silang, in the province of Cavite in 1972. 1979 saw the first batch of freshmen and sophomore students at this new campus and in 1981, with the movement of the juniors and seniors from Baesa, the campus transfer was completed. On August 1, 1996, in accordance with Republic Act (RA) No. 7722 and by the virtue of Resolution No. 132-96, Series of 1996, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted PUC University Status entailing the change of the school’s name from Philippine Union College to Adventist University of the Philippines (AUP). The university acquired Deregulated Status on October 22, 2001, and was awarded Autonomous Status on October 27, 2003.

Mainframes contain numerous secondary assist processors, so the use of \\"engine\\" to refer to a primary workload processor is an attempt to avoid confusion with these I/O, network, and other assist processors. are dedicated to running specific Java and XML workloads under z/OS, accelerating performance. zAAPs are available for zSeries 990 and 890 servers and later zSeries and zEnterprise models. Beginning with the IBM z13, the zAAP functionality is integrated with zIIP processors (zAAP on zIIP). Currently a zAAP engine contains the same underlying hardware as any other mainframe engine. However, IBM uses microcode to limit code execution to Java and XML workloads only. As with Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and zIIP, zAAPs are not specifically optimized to run Java faster or better. IBM does not change the \\"software model\\" or MSU rating on its mainframes with the installation of zAAPs. Consequently, IBM's customers do not incur software license charges for their zAAPs, reducing their costs of running Java- and XML-oriented applications. The number of zAAPs cannot exceed the number of central processors (CPs, general purpose engines) within a zSeries/z9 machine. IBM made the zAAP feature (i.e. the microcode) generally available on June 30, 2004, although the required z/OS release was not generally available until September 24, 2004. zAAPs work with z/OS V1R6 and higher, and Java 1.4.1 and higher. IBM modified the z/OS dispatcher and Workload Manager (WLM) to switch pure Java workload to the dedicated engines. These modifications are completely transparent to Java applications. However, because Java must at least occasionally call native system services (I/O services, for example), some conventional processor (CP) capacity must be available to initiate and sustain a zAAP engine. Major software subsystems that could benefit from zAAP (i.e. that rely on Java workloads) include WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Business Integration Server Foundation, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Message Broker, DB2, CICS Transaction Server, CICS Transaction Gateway, IMS, and (JZOS and z/OS UNIX System Services) Batch, among others. In 2007, IBM added zAAP support to the XML System Services for z/OS, so now products such as DB2 9 for z/OS can also take advantage of zAAPs for XML- related processing. The first commercial production workload for zAAP began on September 1, 2004, at an undisclosed Midwestern U.S. insurance company performing claims processing. The company used Java 1.4.2, WebSphere Application Server Version 5.1, and a near-final z/OS V1R6 build on a zSeries 990 (2084-304/A08 with two zAAPs). This deployment is probably a mainframe record for speed of both development and adoption, since IBM only began its zAAP design project in 2003. Support for zAAPs Third-party independent software vendors (ISVs) have introduced support for execution of their products on zAAP Specialty Engines by using Java or XML Services toolkit from IBM. For example, Ivory Server for z/OS and Ivory Server for CICS from GT Software, Inc. provide zAAP support for XML parsing using the optional IBM z/OS XML Services feature. The Ivory Server for Java will also take advantage of the zAAP in addition to supporting zIIP and the Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL).

Early life Goodwin was born in Norfolk and educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. and obtained a fellowship on 10 November 1617. He left the university and married, took orders and was a popular preacher in his home county and later in London. In 1622 he was the incumbent at East Raynham where he benefited from a bequest by Anne Townshend. For a time he seems to have officiated at St. Mary's, Dover. In 1632 he came to London, and on 18 December 1633 was instituted to the vicarage of St. Stephen's, Coleman Street, vacated by the nonconformist secession of John Davenport. He himself sided with the puritans, and at that period inclined to independency under the influence of John Cotton. In 1635 he was convened for breach of canons, but on his promise of amendment Bishop William Juxon took no further proceedings. In 1638 Goodwin broached from the pulpit of St. Stephen's his opinions on justification by faith, taking a view which was already regarded as practically Arminian; he always cited Calvin as bearing him out on some points. A pulpit controversy with other city ministers on this topic was calmed by Juxon, all parties agreeing to desist. Next year (1639) Goodwin angered his opponents anew by insisting on the need of a learned ministry. Juxon reported to William Laud that he did not despair of a good issue. Goodwin had a hand in drafting the London clerical petition against the new canons of 30 June 1640. Alderman Isaac Pennington was one of his parishioners, and joined his congregational society. In 1639 Goodwin wrote a preface to the posthumous sermons of Henry Ramsden. During the next two years he published several sermons, and a tract (1641) criticising the positions of George Walker, of St. John's, Watling Street. Walker retorted upon Goodwin and others with a charge of Socinianism in the article of justification. Goodwin defended himself in Christ set forth (1642), and in a treatise on justification. Civil War period Goodwin was one of the earliest clerical supporters of the democratic puritans, and then of the army against the Parliament. His Anti-Cavalierisme (1642) proclaims the need of war to suppress the party 'now hammering England to make an Ireland of it.' The doctrine of the divine right of kings he assailed in his Os Ossorianum, or a Bone for a Bishop, against Griffith Williams, bishop of Ossory. He also attacked the presbyterians as a persecuting party in his Θεομαχία, or the grand imprudence of ... fighting against God (1644). In May 1645 he was ejected from his living for refusing to administer indiscriminately in his parish the baptism and the Lord's Supper, setting up a covenanted community within his parish. Goodwin immediately set up an independent church in Coleman Street, which had a large following. William Taylor, his appointed successor at St. Stephen's, was in his turn ejected in 1649, to be restored in 1657. Goodwin obtained the use of the church, but with a diminished revenue. Among his hearers at this period was Thomas Firmin, who took down his sermons in shorthand. The Gangraena (1646) of Thomas Edwards included Goodwin among the subjects of attack; in the second and third parts, published in the same year, Edwards was provoked into savage onslaughts by Goodwin's anonymous reply Cretensis. Goodwin is 'a monstrous sectary, a compound of Socinianism, Arminianism, antinomianism, independency, popery, yea and of scepticism.' He and several of his church 'go to bowls and other sports on days of public thanksgiving.' Cretensis also defended Jeremiah Burroughs and William Greenhill whom Goodwin knew, and also Robert Cosens and John Ellis where the connection was prompted by Edwards (who hit back at them all bracketed together). Goodwin, by his Hagiomastix, or the Scourge of the Saints (1647) came into collision with William Jenkyn, vicar of Christ Church, Newgate, whose Testimony was endorsed (14 December 1647) by fifty-eight presbyterian divines at Sion College. Sixteen members of Goodwin's church issued an Apologetical Account (1647) of their reasons for standing by him. John Goodwin, satirical engraving (18th century). Jenkyn was aided by John Vicars, usher in Christ Church Hospital, who published (1648) an amusing description of 'Coleman-street-conclave' and its minister, 'this most huge Garagantua,' the 'schismatics cheater in chief.' This contains a likeness of Goodwin (engraved by William Richardson) surmounted by a windmill and weathercock, 'pride' and 'error' supplying the breeze. Goodwin translated and printed a part of the Stratagemata Satanae (March 1648) of Acontius under the title Satan's Stratagems; or the Devil's Cabinet-Councel discovered, with recommendatory epistles by himself and John Durie. Acontius, an advocate of religious tolerance, was now stigmatised by Francis Cheynell as a 'sneaking Socinian'. Cheynell sought in vain in the Westminster Assembly to obtain a condemnation of Goodwin's book, but printed (1650) his thoughts about it by request. The translation was reissued with a new title, Darkness Discovered; or the Devil's secret Stratagems laid open (1651). Goodwin defended the most extreme measures of the army leaders. In his Might and Right Well Met (1648), which was answered by John Geree, he applauded Pride's Purge. He was one of the puritan divines who, in the interval between the sentence and execution of the king, offered him their spiritual services. Goodwin mentions in his Ὑβριστοδίκαι. The Obstrvctovrs of Justice (30 May 1649), that he had an hour's conversation or more with Charles, but was not impressed by his visit. He firmly contended in the same tract for the sovereign rights of the people, quoted approvingly John Milton's Tenure of Kings and Magistrates (13 February 1649), and maintained that the proceedings against Charles followed the spirit of the law if not the letter. Two Hymns or Spiritual Songs (1651) were sung in his congregation on 24 October 1651, the thanksgiving day for the victory at the Battle of Worcester. Meanwhile, he pursued theological controversies. His defense of general redemption, Ἀπολύτρωσις ἀπολύτρωσεως, or Redemption Redeemed, appeared in 1651 (reprinted 1840); his Water-Dipping no Firm Footing (1653) and Cata-Baptism (1655) were polemics against baptists. The circumstance that Oliver Cromwell's 'Triers' were mostly independents did not reconcile him to the new ecclesiastical despotism; he arraigned it in his Bασανισταί. Or the Triers [or Tormenters] Tried (1657). Goodwin speaks of himself as having to contend in a manner with the whole earth' (dedication to Cata-Baptism). His ideas were often anticipations. His rational temper made him the opponent of Seekers and Quakers, and gave him some affinity with the Cambridge Platonists. He rejected the distinction allowed by Acontius, between tolerance of error in fundamentals and in other points. He would have men 'call more for light and less for fire from heaven' (epistle in Satan's Stratagems, 1648). In his Divine Authority of the Scriptures Asserted (1648), which won the commendation of Richard Baxter, he maintains, anticipating George Fox and Robert Barclay, that the word of God 'was extant in the world, nay in the hearts and consciences of men, before there was any copy of the word extant in writing.' In his Pagans Debt and Dowry (1651; 1671, a reply to Thomas Barlow), which led to a controversy with Obadiah Howe, he argues that without the letter of the gospel heathens may be saved. After the Restoration At the Restoration Goodwin, with John Milton, was ordered into custody on 16 June 1660. He kept out of the way, and at length was placed in the indemnity, among eighteen persons perpetually incapacitated for any public trust. His Ὑβριστοδίκαι was burned (27 August) by the hangman at the Old Bailey. According to Gilbert Burnet, his comparative immunity was due to his Arminian reputation. He soon returned to his Coleman Street congregation, though not to the emoluments of St. Stephen's, of which he was deprived and Theophilus Alford admitted as his successor, on 29 May 1661. He had written strenuously against the Fifth-monarchy men in 1654 and 1655; but Thomas Venner's meeting house, from which Venner's Rising proceeded, was in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, and here also, in 1653, was Goodwin's study. This may explain why Burnet wrote that Goodwin was one of these enthusiasts. Immediately on Venner's rising, Goodwin's church issued a Declaration (January 1661) disclaiming all sympathy with this or any attempt 'to propagate religion by the sword.' Goodwin was named as one of the men who was excluded from holding any state office in the Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660. He died in the plague year, 1665. By his early marriage he had seven children, two of whom died in 1645.

During the fall marching season, the band performs at the Rose Bowl for UCLA Bruin home football games. Pregame shows by the band aim to build crowd energy and enthusiasm with traditional UCLA songs like \\"Strike Up the Band for UCLA\\", \\"Bruin Warriors\\", and \\"The Mighty Bruins\\". Throughout the game, the band performs custom-arranged rock and pop songs, as well as the traditional fight songs and cheers of the university. The UCLA Varsity Band appears at basketball games and other athletic contests in Pauley Pavilion. In 2018, the Bruin Marching Band was featured on the Muse album \\"Simulation Theory\\" performing the Super Deluxe version of the song \\"Pressure.\\" The UCLA band program, which includes the Marching and Varsity Bands, the Wind Ensemble and the Symphonic Band, is in the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. Band appearances at athletic events are funded primarily by student registration fees, a direct allocation from the Chancellor's Office and donations to the Solid Gold Sound Club. The 1993, UCLA Bruin Marching Band was awarded the Sudler Trophy, an award bestowed on one university marching band every year. Described by a Los Angeles Times reporter as \\"[t]he Heisman Trophy of the collegiate band world\\",Deborah Schoch, \\"The game's other score: Football matters on New Year's Day, sure, but a second set of rivals will march onto the field in Pasadena: the schools' bands.\\" Los Angeles Times, December 31, 2006. the award does not represent the winner of any championship, but rather a band surrounded by great music and tradition that has become respected nationally. All marching members and teaching assistants in the Bruin Marching Band are full-time UCLA students. Style The Solid Gold Sound The UCLA Marching Band marches in a drum corps style with low mark times and glide steps. Field formations include fast moving precision drill progressions, letter blocks, pictures, concert arcs, and the famous Cursive UCLA formation. The band performs many different styles of shows, depending upon the occasion. The exception to the drum corps marching style is the traditional pregame \\"run-on\\" where the band rapidly high-steps onto the field into the block letter U-C-L-A formation. History In 1925, at the Vermont Avenue campus, the UCLA Marching Band originated as a 50-piece ROTC unit under the direction of W. G. Powell. The band was part of the welcoming group when John Philip Sousa visited Los Angeles in 1928, and were directed by Sousa in the performance of \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\".This Month (November) 78 years ago UCLA Today Magazine, November 7, 2006 At that time, the director was Ben Laietsky, a member of Sousa's band. The band remained a military group until 1934. In 1935, under the direction of Leroy Allen, the group became an integral part of campus life, providing music at rallies and games. The original uniforms were military style, with military caps and waist-length capes. Under directors C. B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947. =Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982= In 1952, Clarence Sawhill became director of bands. F. (Freeman) Kelly James became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-Cal football game in 1980.1985 In Memoriam: Freeman Kelly James, Jr., Music: Los Angeles University of California (System) Academic Senate, 1985 Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100-piece Concert Band, an 80-piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60-piece Varsity Band. In the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of Sports Illustrated. It is one of the few so honored beginning with the University of Oklahoma marching band (1954), the Princeton University Band (1955), and later, The Ohio State University Marching Band (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine. In the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the Queen's Guard. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high \\"chair\\" step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation bearskin (or tall busby) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats. In 1961, the band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland. In 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the Title IX educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women's auxiliary unit during World War II, but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war. In 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that. In 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes. =Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson= In 1985, the band ordered newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with gold trim and white, knee- length, gold capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12\\" feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years. In 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats were the then official \\"True Blue\\" color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained. In 1985, Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble. The UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the Sudler Trophy, presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in recognition of the Band's tradition of excellence and innovation. The band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined. Musician and recording executive Herb Alpert gave $30 million to UCLA in November 2007, the single largest individual gift to music higher education in the western United States. Lee retired from UCLA in 2012, and Dr. Travis Cross was appointed the new Wind Ensemble conductor in 2013. Traditions For the football pregame show, the UCLA Marching Band traditionally opens with the Bruin Fanfare and Strike Up The Band for UCLA, a gift from George and Ira Gershwin to UCLA. It was adapted from their showtune \\"Strike Up the Band\\", and was presented to UCLA at an All- University Sing held in Royce Hall during Fall 1936.UCLA History Project - Songs: Strike Up The Band for UCLA The Star Spangled Banner is played by the band in concert formation. Then the band moves into the script UCLA formation to the tune of Bruin Warriors. The band marches off the field to The Mighty Bruins, composed in 1984 by Academy Award-winning composer Bill Conti to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UCLA Alumni Association. Following all athletic contests, the band plays the UCLA Alma Mater \\"Hail to the Hills of Westwood\\". After victories, this is followed by \\"Rover\\". Away game appearances The entire UCLA Bruin Marching Band travels to the San Francisco Bay area each fall for either the Stanford or Cal game. This tradition began in 1931, when the band traveled to the Stanford game by ship from Los Angeles. Beginning in 1989, a portion of the band has taken regular season trips to football games at Arizona, Michigan, Texas, Miami, Ohio State, Colorado, Illinois, Washington, Arizona State, Oregon, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. In 2006, the entire UCLA Bruin Marching Band traveled to South Bend, Indiana, for a game at the University of Notre Dame.

He was a pioneer of Bengali drama. His famous work Meghnad Badh Kavya, is a tragic epic. It consists of nine cantos and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and afflictions of love as spoken by women. Early life and education Dutt was born in Sagordari, a village in Keshabpur Upazila, Jessore District of Undivided Bengal (now Bangladesh). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the Sadar court, and his mother was Jahnvi Devi. He was an exceptionally talented student, recognised by teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. Early exposure to English education and European literature inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, David Lester Richardson. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly Byron. Dutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including Blackwood's Magazine and Bentley's Miscellany. They were, however, never published. It was also the time he began a correspondence with his friend, Gour Das Bysack, which today forms the bulk of sources on his life. =In his own words= \\"Where man in all his truest glory lives, And nature's face is exquisitely sweet; For those fair climes I heave impatient sigh, There let me live and there let me die\\". Madhusudan embraced Christianity at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843. He did not take the name Michael until his marriage in 1848. He describes the day as: Long sunk in superstition's night, By Sin and Satan driven, I saw not, cared not for the light That leads the blind to Heaven. But now, at length thy grace, O Lord! Birds all around me shine; I drink thy sweet, thy precious word, I kneel before thy shrine! He had to leave Hindu College on account of being a convert. In 1844, he resumed his education at Bishop's College, where he stayed for three years. In 1847, he moved to Madras (Chennai) due to family tensions and economic hardship, having been disinherited by his father. While in Madras, he stayed in the Black Town neighbourhood, and began working as an \\"usher\\" at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum. Four years later, in 1851, he became a Second Tutor in the Madras University High School. He edited and assisted in editing the periodicals Madras Circulator and General Chronicle, Athenaeum, Spectator and Hindoo Chronicle. Literary life = Early works (1849-1855) = Dutt wrote exclusively in English in his early writing years. The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and, like Derozio's The Fakeer of Jungheera, is a long narrative poem in which it is difficult to sustain one's interest. In The Anglo- Saxon and the Hindu(1854), an essay in florid, even purple, prose, are references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay's shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of William Wordsworth and John Milton. Dutt was a spirited bohemian and Romantic. = Calcutta Years (1858-1862) = The period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of Bethune and Bysack. He wrote 5 plays: Sermista (1859), Padmavati (1859), Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata (1860), Krishna Kumari (1860) and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: Tilottama Sambhava Kavya (1861), Meghnad Badh Kavya (1861), Brajagana Kavya (1861) and Veerangana Kavya (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own Sermista. = Final years (1866-1873) = A volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866. His final play, Maya Kannan, was written in 1872. The Slaying of Hector, his prose version of the Iliad remains incomplete. = Linguistic abilities = Madhusudan was a gifted linguist and polyglot. He studied Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit. =Work with the sonnet= He dedicated his first sonnet to his friend Rajnarayan Basu, which he accompanied with a letter: \\"What say you to this, my good friend? In my humble opinion, if cultivated by men of genius, our sonnet in time would rival the Italian.\\" His most famous sonnet is Kapatakkha River. Always, o river, you peep in my mind. Always I think you in this loneliness. Always I soothe my ears with the murmur Of your waters in illusion, the way Men hear songs of illusion in a dream. Many a river I have seen on earth; But which can quench my thirst the way you do? You’re the flow of milk in my homeland’s breasts. Will I meet you ever? As long as you Go to kinglike ocean to pay the tax Of water, I beg to you, sing my name Into the ears of people of Bengal, Sing his name, o dear, who in this far land Sings your name in all his songs for Bengal. When Dutt later stayed in Versailles, the sixth centenary of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri was being celebrated all over Europe. He composed a poem in honour of the poet, translated it into French and Italian, and sent it to the king of Italy. Victor Emmanuel II, then monarch, liked the poem and wrote to Dutt, saying, \\"It will be a ring which will connect the Orient with the Occident.\\" =Work in blank verse= Sharmistha (spelt as Sermista in English) was Dutt's first attempt at blank verse in Bengali literature. Kaliprasanna Singha organised a felicitation ceremony to Madhusudan to mark the introduction of blank verse in Bengali poetry. Praising Dutt's blank verse, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, observed: \\"As long as the Bengali race and Bengali literature would exist, the sweet lyre of Madhusudan would never cease playing.\\" He added: \\"Ordinarily, reading of poetry causes a soporific effect, but the intoxicating vigour of Madhusudan's poems makes even a sick man sit up on his bed.\\" In his The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian, Nirad C. Chaudhuri has remarked that during his childhood days in Kishoreganj, a common standard for testing guests' erudition in the Bengali language during family gatherings was to require them to recite the poetry of Dutt, without an accent.The street where M Dutt used to live in Versailles, France  Barrister-at-Law  12 Rue Des Chantiers, 78000 Versailles, France – the apartment building where M. Dutt dwelled (photo taken in July 2011) Dutt 's residence in Khidirpur, Kolkata, India Dutt went to England in 1862 to become a Barrister-at-Law, and enrolled at the Gray's Inn. On the eve of his departure to England: Forget me not, O Mother, Should I fail to return To thy hallowed bosom. Make not the lotus of thy memory Void of its nectar Madhu. (Translated from the original Bengali by the poet.) His family joined him in 1863, and thereafter they shifted to the much cheaper Versailles, due to the miserable state of their finances. Funds were not arriving from India according to his plans. He was only able to relocate to England in 1865 and study for the bar due to the munificent generosity of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. For this, Dutt was to regard Vidyasagar as Dayar Sagar (meaning the ocean of kindness) for as long as he lived. He was admitted to the High Court in Calcutta on his return in February 1867. His family followed him in 1869. His stay in England had left him disillusioned with European culture. He wrote to his friend Bysack from France: Marriage and family Dutt had refused to enter into an arranged marriage which his father had decided for him. He had no respect for that tradition and wanted to break free from the confines of caste-based endogamous marriage. His so-called knowledge of the European tradition convinced him of the so-called superiority of marriages made by mutual consent (or love marriages). He was the first Indian to marry a European or Anglo-Indian woman. While in Madras he married Indo-Scottish- Britton, Rebecca Thompson McTavish, a 17-year-old resident of the Madras Female Orphan Asylum, on 31 July 1848. Dutt assumed the name Michael when the marriage was registered in the baptismal register. They had four children together. He wrote to Bysack in December 1855: Dutt returned from Madras to Calcutta in February 1856, after his father's death (in 1855), abandoning his wife and four children in Madras. No records of his divorce from Rebecca or remarriage have been found. In 1858, he was joined there by a 22-year old of French extraction, Emelia Henrietta Sophie White, the daughter of his colleague at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum. They had two sons, Frederick Michael Milton (23 July 1861 - 11 June 1875) and Albert Napoleon (1869 - 22 August 1909), and a daughter, Henrietta Elizabeth Sermista (1859 - 15 February 1879). A fourth child was stillborn. Their relationship lasted until the end of his life, Henrietta pre-deceasing him by three days, on 26 June 1873. Rebecca died in Madras in July 1892. Only a daughter and a son survived her. The son, McTavish-Dutt, practised as a pleader in the Court of Small Causes in Madras. The tennis player Leander Paes is a direct descendant of Dutt, who is his great great grandfather on his mother's side. Death Dutt died in Calcutta General Hospital on 29 June 1873. Three days prior to his death, he recited a passage from Shakespeare's Macbeth to his dear friend Bysack, to express his deepest conviction of life: ...out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.

He was a native of Los Angeles. Our Gang Billie Thomas first appeared in the 1934 Our Gang shorts For Pete's Sake!, The First Round-Up, and Washee Ironee as a background player. The \\"Buckwheat\\" character was a female at this time, portrayed by Our Gang kid Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard's younger sister Carlena in For Pete's Sake!, and by Willie Mae Walton in three other shorts. Thomas began appearing as \\"Buckwheat\\" with 1935's Mama's Little Pirate. Despite Thomas being a male, the Buckwheat character remained a female—dressed as a Topsy-esque image of the African-American \\"pickaninny\\" stereotype with bowed pigtails, a large hand-me-down sweater and oversized boots. After Stymie's departure from the series later in 1935, the Buckwheat character slowly morphed into a boy, first referred to definitively as a \\"he\\" in 1936's The Pinch Singer. This is similar to the initial handling of another African-American Our Gang member, Allen \\"Farina\\" Hoskins, who worked in the series during the silent and early sound eras. Despite the change in the Buckwheat character's gender, Billie Thomas's androgynous costuming was not changed until his appearance in the 1936 film Pay as You Exit. This new costuming — overalls, striped shirt, oversized shoes, and a large unkempt Afro — was retained for the series until the end. The reason for the change in appearance was so he could portray, in the 1936 Our Gang feature film General Spanky, a five-year-old slave asking men on a riverboat and, subsequently, shoeshine boy Spanky, \\"You be my master?\\". In his Classic Movie Guide write-up for the film, Leonard Maltin surmises that \\"Buckwheat's role as slave in search of a master may displease contemporary audiences.\\"General Spanky at Turner Classic Movies Presents Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide (Penguin, 2015) Thomas remained in Our Gang for ten years, appearing in all but one of the shorts, Feed 'em and Weep (due to sickness when Philip Hurlic filled in for him), made from Washee Ironee in 1934 through the series' end in 1944. During the first half of his Our Gang tenure, Thomas's Buckwheat character was often paired with Eugene \\"Porky\\" Lee as a tag-along team of \\"little kids\\" rallying against (and often outsmarting) the \\"big kids\\", George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland and Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer. Thomas had a speech impediment as a young child, as did Lee, who became Thomas's friend both on the set and off. The \\"Buckwheat\\" and \\"Porky\\" characters both became known for their collective garbled dialogue, in particular their catchphrase, \\"O-tay!\\" originally uttered by Porky, but soon used by both characters. Thomas remained in Our Gang when the series changed production from Hal Roach Studios to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Thomas was the only cast member to appear in all 52 of the MGM-produced entries and was the only holdover from the Hal Roach era to remain in the series until its end in 1944. By 1940, Thomas had grown out of his speech impediment, and with Lee having been replaced by Robert Blake, Thomas's Buckwheat character was written as an archetypal black youth. He was twelve years old when the final Our Gang film, Dancing Romeo, was completed in November 1943. The character of Buckwheat in later years became synonymous with the derogatory \\"pickaninny\\" stereotype. However, the work of Thomas and the other black cast members as actors is credited with helping the cause of race relations by playing alongside white children as equals in a desegregated show during the height of the Jim Crow Era. According to Julia Lee, author of Our Gang: A Racial History of The Little Rascals, Thomas and the others were \\"considered saviors in many ways\\" by the black community as the most popular black stars in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Later, during the 1950s and 1960s, the NAACP fought against the tired and demeaning racial stereotypes and moved to have the television series ended. Later life Thomas enlisted in the United States Army in 1954 at the age of 23, and was released from active military service in 1956 decorated with a National Defense Service Medal and a Good Conduct Medal. Having been 14 when WWII ended in 1945, +/-9 years before he actually joined the military, it is uncertain why his grave marker says \\"Reg US Army, World War II\\". After returning to civilian life, Thomas faced a dilemma shared by many of his co-stars from Our Gang. Though offered many film and stage roles, he had no desire to return to Hollywood as an actor. “After the Army, I wasn't really interested in the hassle of performing,\\" he explained shortly before his death in 1980. \\"Even the big stars had to chase around and audition; it seemed like a rat race to me, with no security.\\" However, Thomas still enjoyed the film industry at large, and had a successful career as a film lab technician with the Technicolor corporation. He took his experience in film work as a spark to learn the trade of film editing and cutting. =Our Gang Fan Club= At \\"Hollywood 80\\", the second annual meeting of The Sons of the Desert, from July 30 to August 3, 1980, more than 500 fans gathered at the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel. Several days were spent touring famous Hollywood attractions, and then the highlight of the gathering took place in the hotel ballroom. Among those honored, on July 31, were fellow Our Gangers George McFarland, Dorothy DeBorba, Tommy Bond, and Joe Cobb. When Thomas was brought out, he received a spontaneous standing ovation, and was moved to tears.\\"Yes, I Met Buckwheat\\" (The Terrible Catsafterme, May 22, 2007) Death On October 10, 1980, ten weeks after his July 31 appearance at the Hilton, Thomas died of a heart attack in his Los Angeles apartment at the age of 49, forty-six years to the day after his mother brought him to audition at the Hal Roach Studios. Thomas is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood. Legacy In 1950, Billy had a son whom he also named William Thomas Jr. William Thomas Jr. the younger, went on to graduate from California State Northridge University in 1975, then in 1992, created the Buckwheat Memorial Scholarship for students at Northridge in his honor. In 2010, he wrote the book \\"Otay!\\" The Billy \\"Buckwheat\\" Thomas Story. On November 30, 2012, he died at the age of 62. Controversies Eddie Murphy performed a series of Buckwheat sketches on Saturday Night Live during the 1980s when he was a cast member.Gehrt, Vicki. \\"His gang Spanky McFarland remembers his long stint as a \`Little Rascal'\\", Chicago Tribune (1993-03-26). But Thomas's co-star George McFarland, who played \\"Spanky\\" in Little Rascals, made it clear that he hated Murphy's imitations. \\"I didn't care for them a bit. Mr. Murphy did a very poor imitation. He made Buckwheat into a stereotype that he wasn't, at the expense of the people in his family who are still alive.\\" In 1990, the ABC newsmagazine 20/20 aired a segment featuring a man named Bill English, then a grocery bagger in Arizona, who claimed to be the adult Buckwheat. English's appearance prompted public objections from McFarland, who contacted media outlets following the broadcast to inform them that the true Buckwheat had been dead for ten years. Despite being confronted by McFarland on the television newsmagazine A Current Affair, English, who died four years later at the age of 60, refused to retreat from his claim, maintaining that he had originated the role of Buckwheat, with other actors playing the character only after he had left it. The next week, 20/20 acknowledged, on-air, that English's claim had been false and apologized for the interview. The fallout from this incident included the resignation of a 20/20 producer\\"'20/20' Producer Resigns Over Buckwheat Interview.\\" Los Angeles Times. Oct. 12 1990. Part F.

Early life and career Laird was born on January 27, 1954 in North Adams, Massachusetts. Toward the end of 1983, Laird was earning just ten dollars an illustration from a local newspaper in Dover, New Hampshire. He was also doing illustrations for fanzines like The Oracle.Wiater, Stanley & Bissette, Stephen R. (ed.s) Comic Book Rebels: Conversations with the Creators of the New Comics (Donald I. Fine, Inc. 1993) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles In May 1984, Laird and Kevin Eastman self- published the first black & white issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, at an initial print run of 3000 copies for the forty-page oversized comic. It was largely funded by a loan from Eastman's uncle, Quentin (the experience of which had a profound impact on Laird, and led indirectly to his later work with the Xeric Foundation), and published by the duo's Mirage Studios, a name chosen because \\"there wasn’t an actual studio, only kitchen tables and couches with lap boards.\\"Bob Burden's Mysterymen Presskit: Kevin Eastman. Accessed April 22, 2008 That first issue received a number of subsequent printings over the next few years, as the Turtles phenomenon began to take off.ComicBookDb: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1. Accessed April 22, 2008 Laird's newspaper experience led to the duo creating \\"a four-page press kit,Pages from the Press Kit can be seen here on Eastman's Heavy Metal website.\\" that, according to Flaming Carrot creator Bob Burden's own Mystery Men press-kit, included \\"a story outline and artwork that they sent to 180 TV and radio stations,\\" as well as both the Associated Press and United Press International. This led to widespread press coverage of both the TMNT property and Mirage Studios itself, creating \\"a demand for the interestingly-titled comic that caught everyone by surprise.\\" With the solicitation of their second issue, Eastman and Laird's Turtles comic began a meteoric rise to success, bringing in advance orders of 15,000 copies. This, Eastman has been quoted as saying, \\"basically ended up with us clearing a profit of two thousand dollars apiece. Which allowed us to write and draw stories full-time: it was enough to pay the rent, pay the bills, and buy enough macaroni and cheese and pencils to live on.\\" The Turtles phenomenon saw the duo invited to their first comics convention at the tenth annual Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1984, where they mingled with the likes of Larry Niven, Forrest J Ackerman and Fred Hembeck (among others).David Merrill \\"The Atlanta Fantasy Fair\\" . Accessed April 22, 2008 With their (November 1985) fifth issue, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles downsized to the more common American comics format and size, and the previous four issues were also reprinted in this size and format with new color covers. Also in 1985, Solson Publications released How To Draw Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Solson would follow this up with the six issue Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Authorized Martial Arts Training Manual as well as one issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teach Karate volume in 1987. =Unexpected success= That the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became such a success (and in such a short space of time) came as a surprise to both Eastman and Laird. Laird has stated on several occasions that: This led to increased pressures on the two creators (and the team which they formed to help them), including a prolonged period (about a year) of artist's block in Laird. The \\"incredible growth and complexity of the business\\" that sprang up around their instantly- successful Turtles properties led to Laird's \\"suddenly discover[ing] to my horror that I no longer enjoyed drawing. It was a real shock, because if I ever had anything that I could rely on... it was that I loved to draw.\\" Laird and Eastman's creations went on to become a popular cultural phenomenon, forcing both of them to take regular sabbaticals from the comic to deal with the day to day pressures of running what had become a multimedia franchise. Eastman sold his share of the franchise, with the exception of a small continuing income participation, to Laird and the Mirage Group on June 1, 2000.Daniel Robert Epstein interview with Peter Laird, c2002/2003 . Accessed April 22, 2008 On March 1, 2008, Laird and Mirage bought out Eastman's remaining rights and interest and the two went their separate ways. Concerning Eastman's departure, Laird stated his belief that Eastman \\"was just tired of it.\\" On October 19, 2009, Laird sold the franchise to Viacom parent company of Nickelodeon, but still retains the rights to create and publish up to eighteen black-and-white comics based on the franchise per year. Animation Although ostensibly over-seeing the animated Turtles projects through Mirage, Laird had minimal hands-on involvement in the development of the original animated series, and even less with the Next Mutation series. One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as \\"a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine.\\" In this role, he says \\"[f]rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I've been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I've seen a few of the episodes, and it's neat to see a lot of the stuff I've worked on.\\" While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with \\"Volume Four\\" (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched Tales of the TMNT to accompany the fourth volume. Following a successful deal to revive the Turtles theatrically, Laird put Volume Four on hold to develop the new movie; leaving several plot lines unresolved. Tales of the TMNT was thought to go on hiatus in 2008, and the franchise's future beyond its on-screen presence was uncertain, but staff confirmed that this was not the case. It was confirmed on Steve Murphy's blog that Peter Laird was intending to return to Volume 4 and that the title would return, distributed digitally by Mirage.\\"CCJ\\" interviews Steve Murphy, July 10, 2007. Accessed June 27, 2008 Mirage Studios With the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Eastman and Laird hired a core group of artists to help with the increasing workload, beginning with Eastman's high school friend Steve Lavigne, brought on in 1984 as a letterer. In 1985, Eastman and Laird hired Cleveland artist Ryan Brown to assist them as an inker, and a year later penciler Jim Lawson cover painter Michael Dooney joined the studio. These six individuals would allow Mirage to expand into a number of spin-off and companion titles, starting with Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, designed to fill in continuity gaps in the main title. Operating from a renovated factory space in Florence, Massachusetts, the Mirage team produced most of their work in-house, including the Playmates Toys toy designs and the Archie TMNT comic series, until Tundra Publishing took over the building. Eastman and Laird along with Brown, Dooney, Lavigne and Lawson toured extensively over the years, making personal appearances and attending many comic book conventions. As the Turtles' popularity increased, further people were added to the studio, including Eric Talbot (who attended Eastman and Lavigne's old high school), writer Stephen Murphy, and Brown's friend, Dan Berger, who was brought in from Ohio to ink the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures title from Archie Comics. Aside from Eastman (whose creative differences and other pursuits saw him leave and sell his interest to Laird and Mirage), these individuals have remained with Mirage to the present. Stephen Murphy stepped down from his position as Managing Editor in summer, 2007 in favor of Dan Berger; Murphy remains as Creative Director.\\"Outgoing editor Steve Murphy on the Turtles past, present and future\\" by Benjamin Ong Pang Kean at Newsarama, July 9, 2007 . Accessed June 27, 2008. In 1988, Mirage Studios participated in the drafting of the Creator's Bill of Rights for comic book creators. The Xeric Foundation In addition to his other interests, Laird founded the Xeric Foundation, a nonprofit organization created after considerable thought, as \\"an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world,\\" by providing grants for self-publishers. While Eastman founded Tundra Publishing to embody the ideals of the Creator's Bill of Rights from a publishers standpoint, Laird's vision involved funding rather than actively publishing individuals' work. His reasoning for this decision was in part simply due to him having \\"far too much to do as it is with Mirage.\\" He \\"preferred to do something where it was more of a transfer of capital,\\" with \\"all the worries... on other people's shoulders.\\" The foundation itself, he explains is: \\"actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self- publish their comics.\\" That later half is perhaps what the foundation is best known for, working much the same as any benevolent fund, involving an applicatory process detailing how much money is being applied for and why. =Origins= Laird's \\"experience with the Turtles and self-publishing\\" was a learning process that, he felt \\"would be very valuable to other people to go through\\" as well, \\"in teaching creators about themselves, about life [and] about the hard reality of business.\\" He cites the summits he, Eastman, Scott McCloud, Dave Sim and others had (which led directly to the formalising of the \\"Creator's Bill of Rights,\\" setting out in writing the necessary working arrangements that comics creator's felt ought to be met regarding ownership of their work and proper remuneration, etc.) in informing his decision to set up the Foundation, but also notes that he received \\"many requests for money,\\" necessitating the creation of the Xeric Foundation's charitable end simply to deal with such requests \\"in an organized fashion.\\" Indeed, when asked in an interviewProject Fanboy interview with Peter Laird on the Project Fanboy website, Laird was quoted as saying: > \\"The initial impetus for creating the Xeric Foundation was frustration -- > when the Turtle thing started getting really huge, people started coming out > of the woodwork to ask for money. Many of them were legitimate charitable > organizations or creators needing funding, but there were also quite a few > ridiculous things -- like the total stranger who asked me for a quarter of a > million dollars to fund his general store. It got to the point where I was > getting overwhelmed with making these kinds of decisions, and it was > suggested to me that a foundation might be a good way to \\"separate the wheat > from the chaff\\", providing official and clearly delineated channels through > which people looking for money had to make their way.\\" Laird recalled that the publication of the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: \\"if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently as a result of that delay?\\" It occurred to him that \\"there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of\\" a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his \\"good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out\\" (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those \\"involved in charitable organizations\\"). Moreover, he cites \\"[a] big difference\\" between his and Eastman's personal Turtles situation and the charitable foundation as being \\"that the Xeric grants are not loans, which have to be paid back, but actual grants, which do not.\\" He \\"credit[s] Kendall Clark, who has run the foundation for me from the beginning, as one of the main reasons it has worked as well as it has... she's done a wonderful job.\\" =Naming and process= The naming of the Foundation \\"originated out of a Scrabble game with [Laird's] brother Don,\\" \\"Xeric\\" simply being \\"a word [he] like[d]\\" ostensibly meaning dry and desertlike - but which ultimately \\"has absolutely no direct connection with the foundation.\\" The creative side of the Foundation involves the usual application process, but in addition, the Foundation began with \\"an advisory committee made up of three... people working in the industry\\" whose input is sought on how best to proceed with each application. Submissions are evaluated prior to Laird's involvement, and then he makes the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations. Laird stated in 1993 that: \\"...knock on wood, God willing, and the creek don't rise, if we go on for another couple of decades, and I'm able to put more money into the basic funding of the Xeric Foundation, then the amount of money that can be given out can really be raised significantly.\\" He hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from \\"thousands of dollars\\" to \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars,\\" to support an increasing number of large and small projects. Other work In a 1993 interview with Stephen Bissette and Stanley Wiater, interviewer-editors of Comic Book Rebels, Laird commented: Since that time, Laird has been able to find time to pursue some other comic book work, including publishing Stupid Heroes, and the graphic novel trilogy, Planet Racers, with Jim Lawson. Even this ties into the TMNT, however, since the 2003 TMNT series has episodes based on the Planet Racer's theme. In December 2019, issue #100 of IDW Publishing's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic series featured a teaser ad for an upcoming comic project titled The Last Ronin in which the prospect of a possible reunion and cooperation between Laird and Eastman was held out.\\"City at War: The End\\".

They are known for their artwork, weaving, wood, plastic and metal crafts and epic literature, the Darangen. They are ethnically and culturally closely related to the Iranun, and Maguindanao, all three groups being denoted as speaking Danao languages and giving name to the island of Mindanao.  Etymology  A satellite image of Lake Lanao. The name \\"Maranao\\" (also spelled \\"Meranao\\" or \\"Meranaw\\") means \\"people of the lake\\" (lanaw or ranaw, archaic danaw, means \\"lake\\" in the Maranao language). This is in reference to Lake Lanao, the ancestral homelands of the Maranao people. The original endonym of the ancestral Maranao is believed to be \\"Iranun\\" or \\"Iranaoan\\". This group later diverged, resulting in the modern Maguindanao and the Iranun people (whose names can also be translated to \\"people of the lake\\"), while the ancestral Iranuns who stayed in Lake Lanao became known as the Maranao.

This lake is the subject of various myths and legends. It supports a major fishery, and powers the hydroelectric plant installed on it; the Agus River system generates 70% of the electricity used by the people of Mindanao. A commanding view of the lake is offered by Marawi City, the provincial capital. =Language= Maranao is an Austronesian language spoken by the Maranao people in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao, many Maranaos are also fluent in Cebuano. Arabic, a Central Semitic language, is spoken by a minority of the Moro people, as it is the liturgical language of Islam. Most Maranaos, however, do not know Arabic beyond its religious use. =Art= Sarimanok or (Papanoka Mra) is a legendary birds of the Maranao that has become a ubiquitous symbol of their artSarimanok, Papanoka \\"Mra\\" or \\"Mara patik\\" is a legendary bird of the Maranao that is a ubiquitous symbol of their art. It is depicted as a Hoodhud (Arabic) with colorful wings and feathered tail, holding a fish on its beak or talons. The head of Sarimanok is like the head of a Hoopoe (Balalatoc in maranaw) and is profusely decorated with scroll, leaf and spiral motifs (okir). It is a symbol of good fortune. The Maranao have also developed their own adaptation of the Ramayana epic, the Maharadia Lawana. They also have a traditional dance, the Singkil, which was based on another local Ramayana adaptation, the Darangen. =Music= A Kulintang ensemble at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka. Maranao kulintang music is a type of a gong music. Sarunaayfis also found among both Muslim and non-Muslim groups of the Southern Philippines. Kobbing is a Maranao instrument and Biyula is another popular Instrument. Biyula is a string instrument. In 2005, the Darangen Epic of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao was selected by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. =Cuisine= Maranao cuisine is quite spicy, with spices mixed up. Traditionally cultivated spices, locally known as palapa (Bontang, native product in Gandamatu) are a common condiment. It is made of stewed scallion bulbs or “sakurab” in Maranao. Thinly sliced scallion bulbs and ginger are caramelized by slow cooking and mixed with chilies and coconut oil. Dishes are intertwined with important cultural rituals across all aspects of Maranao culture: from birth to death.! Social structure Traditionally, the Maranao society is divided into two strata. Namely, Mapiyatao (Pure) and Kasilidan (Mixed blood). Kasilidan is further subdivided into categories which are as follows; Sarowang (Non- Maranao), Balbal (Beast), Dagamot (Sorcerer/Sorceress) and Bisaya (Slave). The Mapiyatao are those natives who are entitled to ascend to thrones and has a pure royal bloodline. On the other hand, the Kasilidan are those natives who are suspected of mixed bloodline. However, due to the changes brought by time, these social strata are beginning to decline due to the rise of wealth of each and every Maranao families. Demographics The Maranao people are shown in chocolate brown in this map. Maranaos number 1,354,542 in 2010, representing 1.47% of the population. Along with the Iranun and Maguindanao, the Maranao are one of three, related, indigenous groups native to Mindanao. These groups share genes, linguistic and cultural ties to non-Muslim Lumad groups such as the Tiruray or Subanon. Maranao royals have varied infusions of Arab, Indian, Malay, and Chinese ancestry. History As with other Indigenous and Mindanao Lumads, during the nominal occupation of the Philippines by the Spanish, and later the American and the Japanese, the Maranaos had tribal leaders whom they called Datu. In the 14th century, upon the arrival of Islam, they developed into a kingdom with a Sultan due to the influence of Muslim missionaries. Notable Maranaos * Mamintal A.J.

This is the first of three movies that paired stars Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, the others being The Glenn Miller Story and Strategic Air Command. Stratton commented that Mr. Stewart \\"did a great job of playing me, in a picture which I figure was about as true to life as they could make it\\". The Stratton Story was a financial success and won the Academy Award for best Writing – Motion Picture Story. Plot Texas farm boy Monty Stratton (Stewart) demonstrates a knack for pitching a baseball. With the help of washed-up, catcher-turned-scout Barney Wile (Morgan), he manages to get a tryout with the Chicago White Sox during their spring training in California. He shows promise and is given a contract. On his first evening at spring training, he is introduced to a young woman named Ethel (Allyson). They start dating and fall in love. Stratton must part from Ethel to go to Chicago. When Stratton is sent down to a minor league team, he proposes marriage. Stratton is called back up to the White Sox and returns to Chicago with his newlywed bride. By the end of the season, they're expecting a child. Next season, he is pitching an away game and doesn't seem to be able to keep his mind on the game. He wishes he was with his wife who's giving birth in Chicago. When he is notified that he has a son, he throws a wild pitch and is taken out of the game—grinning from ear to ear. As his career progresses, Stratton improves so much that he's voted an all-star in the American League. In the off-season of 1938, Stratton accidentally shoots himself in his right leg while hunting on his farm in Texas. When his leg has to be amputated, it looks as though his pitching career is over. He understandably goes through a very dark, brooding period. Nevertheless, with the support of his wife and a wooden leg, Stratton learns to walk along with his baby boy. He works hard and starts practicing his pitching again. He makes an inspirational, successful minor league comeback in 1946.

He is best known as the singer and lyricist of the rock duo B'z, the best-selling music act in their native Japan. He has also had a successful solo career, with five studio albums and five singles topping the Japanese music charts. He collaborated with Slash on single \\"Sahara\\" which was released in 2009. In 2017, he released a collaborative album, Chubby Groove, with Stevie Salas under the name \\"Inaba/Salas\\".  Early life  Koshi Inaba was born and raised in Tsuyama, Okayama, and enrolled in Yokohama National University's Faculty for Education in 1983 to become a qualified mathematics teacher. Inaba made his musical debut in 1985 whilst still a student, contributing vocals to Toshiya \\"Ran\\" Matsukawa's album Burning ~Dedication to Randy Rhoads~ under the stage name Mr. Crazy Tiger. He graduated in 1987 when also formed a short-lived band.  B'z and solo career  Beginning with B'z in 1988, Inaba has, together with guitarist Tak Matsumoto, continued to release new material and tour as part of B'z almost every year since. He has also periodically released solo material, starting in 1997 with the album Magma, produced whilst B'z were on a brief hiatus. It was one of the albums to receive the \\"Best Rock Album of the Year\\" award at the 12th Japan Gold Disc Awards. Unlike in B'z, where he contributes only lyrics, Inaba has composed the music for his solo releases. All his studio albums and singles until now have topped the Oricon music charts. Additionally, the first studio album with 1,001,160 sold copies was the 21st best-selling album of the year, second Shian with 438,930 copies was the 39th in 2002, third Peace of Mind with 297,103 copies was 48th in 2004, fourth Hadou with 177,984 was 38th in 2010, and Singing Bird with 107,551 was certified Gold by RIAJ. As for singles, \\"Tooku Made\\" with 663,660 sold copies was the 28th best-selling single of the year 1999, \\"Ki\\" with 275,957 copies was 25th in 2003, \\"Wonderland\\" with 225,229 copies was 36th in 2004, \\"Okay\\" with 134,381 copies was 45th in 2010, and \\"Hane\\" was certified Gold and was 51st in 2016. His live video recordings also topped the charts, hence cumulatively, according to reported yearly sales and certifications he sold over 3.4 million records. Inaba has also sung on other artists' releases, such as the Steve Vai song \\"Asian Sky\\" from the album The Ultra Zone in 1999. On September 29, 2009, it was announced that Inaba would be featured in Slash's 2010 solo album, Slash. Inaba sang on the first single, \\"Sahara\\", released on November 11, 2009, in Japan. The song, for which Inaba wrote the lyrics, was featured as the 15th track of the Japanese edition of the album. The single charted at #4 on the Oricon weekly singles chart. On February 24, 2010, it was announced that single \\"Sahara\\" won the Western \\"Single of the Year\\" award at Japan Gold Disc Award held by RIAJ. In 2017, Inaba released a collaborative album with Stevie Salas under the name \\"Inaba/Salas\\". The album, Chubby Groove, went to #2 in the Japanese album charts and was certified Gold by RIAJ. Hiroshi Inaba takes care of his physical condition by not drinking alcohol and not using the air conditioning much during the tour to protect his throat. Marty Friedman once listed Hiroshi Inaba as the best vocalist in the whole world. The reason for this, he says, is that his voice hasn't faded after more than 20 years of singing hard rock songs.

It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body. This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development. This disease typically occurs in chronic alcoholics who have some sort of nutritional deficiency. Treatment may involve nutritional supplementation, pain management, and abstaining from alcohol. Signs and symptoms Alcoholic polyneuropathy usually has a gradual onset over months or even years although axonal degeneration often begins before an individual experiences any symptoms. An early warning sign (prodrome) of the possibility of developing alcoholic polyneuropathy, especially in a chronic alcoholic, would be weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead to the development of the disease. The disease typically involves sensory and motor loss, as well as painful physical perceptions (paresthesias), though all sensory modalities may be involved. Symptoms that affect the sensory and motor systems seem to develop symmetrically. For example, if the right foot is affected, the left foot is affected simultaneously or soon becomes affected. In most cases, the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle. This is called a stocking-and-glove pattern of sensory disturbances. Polyneuropathy spans a large range of severity. Some cases are seemingly asymptomatic and may only be recognized on careful examination. The most severe cases may cause profound physical disability. =Sensory= Common manifestations of sensory issues include numbness or painful sensations in the arms and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on the severity of the polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others. In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a burning sensation in their feet and calves. =Motor= Sensory symptoms are gradually followed by motor symptoms. Motor symptoms may include muscle cramps and weakness, erectile dysfunction in men, problems urinating, constipation, and diarrhea. Individuals also may experience muscle wasting and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Some people may experience frequent falls and gait unsteadiness due to ataxia. This ataxia may be caused by cerebellar degeneration, sensory ataxia, or distal muscle weakness. Over time, alcoholic polyneuropathy may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), speech impairment (disarthria), muscle spasms, and muscle atrophy. In addition to alcoholic polyneuropathy, the individual may also show other related disorders such as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome and cerebellar degeneration that result from alcoholism-related nutritional disorders. Causes The general cause of this disease is prolonged and heavy consumption of alcohol accompanied by a nutritional deficiency. There is some debate over whether the main cause is the direct toxic effect of alcohol itself or whether the disease is a result of alcoholism-related malnutrition. Frequently alcoholics have disrupted social links in their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. There is evidence that providing individuals with adequate vitamins improves symptoms despite continued alcohol intake, indicating that vitamin deficiency may be a major factor in the development and progression of alcoholic polyneuropathy. In model experimental models of alcoholic polyneuropathy utilizing rats and monkeys no convincing evidence was found that proper nutritional intake along with alcohol results in polyneuropathy. In addition, the consumption of alcohol may lead to the buildup of certain toxins in the body. For example, in the process of breaking down alcohol, the body produces acetaldehyde, which can accumulate to toxic levels in alcoholics. This suggests that there is a possibility ethanol (or its metabolites) may cause alcoholic polyneuropathy. There is evidence that polyneuropathy is also prevalent in well nourished alcoholics, supporting the idea that there is a direct toxic effect of alcohol. Many of the studies conducted that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess nutritional deficiency in the subjects because they may not have completely ruled out the possibility of a nutritional deficiency in the genesis of the polyneuropathy. Many researchers favor the nutritional origin of this disease, but the possibility of alcohol having a toxic effect on the peripheral nerves has not been completely ruled out. Pathophysiology Thiamine pyrophosphate structure. As a result of nutritional deficiency in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, low thiamine levels are usually present and have been proposed as a cause of the nerve destruction. The pathophysiology of alcoholic polyneuropathy is an area of current research. Damage to the nervous system takes place before symptoms appear in individuals, beginning with segmental thinning and loss of myelin on the peripheral ends of the longest nerves. Segmental thinning is the demyelination of axons in small sections at a time. This occurrence increases leakage of an action potential current down the axon, so it is weakest at the peripheral end. Decrease in current causes further thinning of myelin. In most cases, individuals with alcoholic polyneuropathy have some degree of nutritional deficiency. Alcohol, a carbohydrate, increases the metabolic demand for thiamine (vitamin B1) because of its role in the metabolism of glucose. Thiamine levels are usually low in alcoholics due to their decreased nutritional intake. In addition, alcohol interferes with intestinal absorption of thiamine, thereby further decreasing thiamine levels in the body. Thiamine is important in three reactions in the metabolism of glucose: the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid, d-ketoglutaric acid, and transketolase. A lack of thiamine in the cells may therefore prevent neurons from maintaining necessary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a result of impaired glycolosis. Thiamine deficiency alone could explain the impaired nerve conduction in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, but other factors likely play a part. The metabolic effects of liver damage associated with alcoholism may also contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Normal products of the liver, such as lipoic acid, may be deficient in alcoholics. This deficiency would also disrupt glycolosis and alter metabolism, transport, storage, and activation of essential nutrients. The malnutrition many alcoholics suffer deprives them of important cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and disruption of the cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this is also known as retrograde degeneration. Acetaldehyde is toxic to peripheral nerves. There are increased levels of acetaldehyde produced during ethanol metabolism. If the acetaldehyde is not metabolized quickly the nerves may be affected by the accumulation of acetaldehyde to toxic levels. Diagnosis Alcoholic polyneuropathy is very similar to other axonal degenerative polyneuropathies and therefore can be difficult to diagnose. When alcoholics have sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a nutritional deficiency, a diagnosis of alcoholic polyneuropathy is often reached. To confirm the diagnosis, a physician must rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes. Other neuropathies can be differentiated on the basis of typical clinical or laboratory features. Differential diagnoses to alcoholic polyneuropathy include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, beriberi, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and post- polio syndrome. To clarify the diagnosis, medical workup most commonly involves laboratory tests, though, in some cases, imaging, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and vibrometer testing may also be used. A number of tests may be used to rule out other causes of peripheral neuropathy. One of the first presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus may be peripheral neuropathy, and hemoglobin A1C can be used to estimate average blood glucose levels. Elevated blood creatinine levels may indicate chronic kidney disease and may also be a cause of peripheral neuropathy. A heavy metal toxicity screen should also be used to exclude lead toxicity as a cause of neuropathy. Alcoholism is normally associated with nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Thiamine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay thiamine in the blood and urine. A liver function test may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels. Management Although there is no known cure for alcoholic polyneuropathy, there are a number of treatments that can control symptoms and promote independence. Physical therapy is beneficial for strength training of weakened muscles, as well as for gait and balance training. =Nutrition= intravenous home parenteral nutrition formula may be a part of the treatment plan for those with alcoholic polyneuropathy who also suffer from nutritional deficiency. To best manage symptoms, refraining from consuming alcohol is essential. Abstinence from alcohol encourages proper diet and helps prevent progression or recurrence of the neuropathy. Once an individual stops consuming alcohol it is important to make sure they understand that substantial recovery usually isn't seen for a few months. Some subjective improvement may appear right away, but this is usually due to the overall benefits of alcohol detoxification. If alcohol consumption continues, vitamin supplementation alone is not enough to improve the symptoms of most individuals. Nutritional therapy with parenteral multivitamins is beneficial to implement until the person can maintain adequate nutritional intake. Treatments also include vitamin supplementation (especially thiamine). In more severe cases of nutritional deficiency 320 mg/day of benfotiamine for 4 weeks followed by 120 mg/day for 4 more weeks may be prescribed in an effort to return thiamine levels to normal. =Pain= Painful dysesthesias caused by alcoholic polyneuropathy can be treated by using gabapentin or amitriptyline in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Anticonvulsant drugs like gabapentin block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and have properties that relieve neuropathic pain. However, these medications take a few weeks to become effective and are rarely used in the treatment of acute pain. Topical analgesics like capsaicin may also relieve minor aches and pains of muscles and joints. Prognosis It is difficult to assess the prognosis of a patient because it is hard to convince chronic alcoholics to abstain from drinking alcohol completely. It has been shown that a good prognosis may be given for mild neuropathy if the alcoholic has abstained from drinking for 3–5 years. During the early stages of the disease the damage appears reversible when people take adequate amounts of vitamins, such as thiamine. If the polyneuropathy is mild, the individual normally experiences a significant improvement and symptoms may be completely eliminated within weeks to months after proper nutrition is established. When those people diagnosed with alcohol polyneuropathy experience a recovery, it is presumed to result from regeneration and collateral sprouting of the damaged axons. As the disease progresses, the damage may become permanent. In severe cases of thiamine deficiency, a few of the positive symptoms (including neuropathic pain) may persist indefinitely. Even after the restoration of a balanced nutritional intake, those patients with severe or chronic polyneuropathy may experience lifelong residual symptoms. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is not life-threatening but may significantly affect one's quality of life. Effects of the disease range from mild discomfort to severe disability. Epidemiology Total recorded alcohol consumption per capita of individuals 15 years or older, in liters of pure alcohol. Alcoholism is the main cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy. The rate of incidence of alcoholic polyneuropathy involving sensory and motor polyneuropathy varies from 10% to 50% of alcoholics depending on the subject selection and diagnostic criteria. If electrodiagnostic criteria is used, alcoholic polyneuropathy may be found in up to 90% of individuals being assessed. The distribution and severity of the disease depends on regional dietary habits, individual drinking habits, as well as an individual's genetics. Large studies have been conducted and show that alcoholic polyneuropathy severity and incidence correlates best with the total lifetime consumption of alcohol. Factors such as nutritional intake, age, or other medical conditions are correlate in lesser degrees. For unknown reasons, alcoholic polyneuropathy has a high incidence in women. Certain alcoholic beverages can also contain congeners that may also be bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying alcoholic beverages may result in different health consequences. An individual's nutritional intake also plays a role in the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid and biotin, vitamin B12, folic acid, niacin (vitamin B3), and vitamin A. =Acetaldehyde= Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde. The toxic buildup of acetaldehyde may result in alcoholic polyneuropathy. It is also thought there is perhaps a genetic predisposition for some alcoholics that results in increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body's processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase; acetaldehyde is then oxidized to acetate mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ALDH2 is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of acetaldehyde may play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy. History John C. Lettsome noted in 1787 hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients, a characteristic of alcoholic polyneuropathy. The first description of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson has also been credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was a direct result of the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two. Research directions The mechanism of axonal degeneration has not been clarified and is an area of continuing research on alcoholic polyneuropathy. Further research is looking at the effect an alcoholics’ consumption and choice of alcoholic beverage on their development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some beverages may include more nutrients than others (such as thiamine), but the effects of this with regards to helping with a nutritional deficiency in alcoholics is yet unknown. There is still controversy about the reasons for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it is a direct result of alcohol's toxic effect on the nerves, but others say factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. This debate is ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.

He was born in Palacios, Texas (some sources state Wagner, Texas) and lived in Greenville, Texas, for part of his life. His major league career ended prematurely when a hunting accident in 1938 forced doctors to amputate his right leg. Wearing a prosthetic leg, Stratton played in the minor leagues from 1946 to 1953. His comeback was the subject of the 1949 film The Stratton Story, in which he was portrayed by Jimmy Stewart. Major league career Stratton began his career with the Van Alstyne Grays before playing for the Chicago White Sox. Stratton pitched five years with the White Sox (1934–38), compiling a career 36–23 record with 196 strikeouts and a 3.71 ERA in 487.1 innings. As a hitter, Stratton was better than average for a pitcher, posting a .224 batting average (43-for-192) with 33 runs, 4 home runs and 24 RBI in 71 games. Defensively, he recorded a .975 fielding percentage. A 6-foot-5-inch right-hander, Stratton made his debut with the White Sox on June 2, 1934. He became a starter in 1937, winning 15 games with a 2.40 ERA and five shutouts, and made the American League All-Star squad. The following season, he again won 15 and completed 17 of his 22 starts. Post-accident On November 27, 1938, Stratton was hunting rabbits on his family farm when he fell, accidentally discharging his shotgun. The pellets struck his right leg, damaging a main artery enough to require amputation the next day. Fitted with a wooden leg, Stratton worked with the White Sox the next two years as a coach and batting practice pitcher. In 1939, White Sox management sponsored a charity game in Comiskey Park against the Chicago Cubs, the proceeds of which (about $28,000 equal to $ today) went to Stratton. In a touching, courageous display, Stratton took the mound to demonstrate that he could still pitch, though he was unable to transfer his weight effectively to the artificial leg. When World War II began, Stratton attempted to enlist but was rejected. Then, he organized a semi-professional baseball team at Greenville, Texas, and constantly practiced coordination on the field. He spent much time experimenting and learning how to pitch despite the prosthetic leg, primarily pitching to his wife, Ethel (Milberger) Stratton, and against the side of a barn. In 1946, Stratton pitched for the Sherman Twins of the East Texas League (Class C) and compiled a record of 18–8, with a 4.17 earned run average (ERA). In 1947, with the Waco Dons of the Big State League (Class B), Stratton went 7–7 with a 6.55 ERA. A major challenge for Stratton was moving nimbly enough on his prosthetic leg to field the bunts that were commonly sent his way by opponents. After 1947, Stratton never appeared in more than four games in a season, though he joined multiple minor-league teams ranging from Class B to Class D in 1949, 1950, and 1953. Legacy and life after baseball His comeback attempt was the subject of a 1949 film and Lux Radio Theatre episode as The Stratton Story, both of which starred Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, with big-leaguers Gene Bearden, Bill Dickey, Merv Shea, and Jimmy Dykes in cameo appearances. Stratton had spent most of one year in Hollywood serving as an adviser for the movie. The film was a financial success and earned an Academy Award for best original story. The Strattons, who lived for many years on a 93-acre farm in the Ardis Heights area of Greenville, were members of Wesley Methodist Church and were also active in the Greenville community. Monty Stratton helped start the Greenville Little League Baseball program and was recognized for his efforts by the naming of Monty Stratton Field near Greenville High School. Stratton died in Greenville, Texas, on September 29, 1982, at the age of 70 due to cancer. He was survived by his wife, Ethel; a son, Monty Jr.; two brothers; a sister; and four grandchildren. Ethel, who served for many years as a volunteer at Hunt Regional Medical Center in Greenville, died in 2006 in Arlington, Texas at age 90. Monty and Ethel Stratton are buried at Memoryland Memorial Park in Greenville.

Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and pesticides, allowed for the Green Revolution, an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century. Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the United Kingdom during the Malayan Emergency and the United States in the Vietnam War.  Use and application  A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical herbicides used as defoliants are 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth. These phenoxy herbicides were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of World War II and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War. Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly cotton, in the United States as well as a number of other cotton- producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality. The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest- aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and thidiazuron. According to a 1998 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.NASS (1999). Agricultural Chemical Usage 1998 Field Crops Summary. Washington, D.C.: U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics and Economic Research Service. pg 141.  Health and environmental effects  In 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and marine life. High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible carcinogen and a toxin to freshwater and marine invertebrates. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen. A published study in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry reported that through successive surface runoff events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones. Agent Orange, a defoliant used by the United Kingdom during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s and the United States during the Vietnam War to defoliate regions of Vietnam from 1961 to 1971, has been linked to several long-term health issues. Agent Orange contains a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T as well as dioxin contaminants. Members of the Air Force Ranch Hand and the Army Chemical Corps who served in the Vietnam War were occupationally exposed to Agent Orange have a higher incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases. Among other occupations, farmers are at a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease due to a greater chance of defoliant exposure.

Although quite a new music style in Bosnia, it has nevertheless proven to be very popular. The hip hop scene has coalesced around several major portals on the internet. The center of hip hop and hip hop culture used to be only Tuzla, primarily thanks to the first radio hip hop show and label called FMJAM and their crew, with the big help of popular rappers Edo Maajka and Frenkie. Recent Today, hip hop is more popular than ever before. Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar are three cities that are the most popular ones today, when it comes to new releases and hip hop happenings and concerts. Artists like Mayer and crew's like Malter, DoggSound, REVSKL and HighTime, are currently the most popular ones in Mostar. While in Sarajevo artists like Buba Corelli and from BluntBylon and crews like Capital City Crew, Treća Smjena Crew including Sajfer and Santos, G-Recordz etc. belong in the category of the most popular and listened artists in the country. For the first time in history of Bosnian hip hop culture, it is possible to hear and find new songs and videos on TV, which was almost unheard of back in the 2000s. Media picture of hip hop is growing with BHOP Portal being the most updated website when it comes to being the place to find everything that is currently happening in Bosnian hip hop, and currently it is the most visited internet website that specifically covers the Bosnian hip hop scene. FMJAM is the most popular crew and private 'net' label in the country, and their radio is going on strong for more than ten years with DJ Soul as the main DJ. Facebook and YouTube still remain the main tool artists use to develop their fan base, because even though hip hop has gotten more popular in Bosnia, it is still nowhere near the level other popular music styles are, when it comes to fans, media coverage and anything else of that sort. History of Bosnian Hip Hop In the late 1980s, a rapper emerged name \\"Elvir Reper\\", who never recorded any songs, but did actively engage in rapping and is credited as introducing hip hop material from popular American hip hop acts at that time. Because of the war in Bosnia that started in 1992, hip hop stopped for a while, only to be revived by what has become known as the second wave of hip hop. Artists such as Alaga, Mr. Johnny (Sarajevo) Crni Zvuk, Kwonel and MC Fudo (Tuzla) emerged with numerous demo songs, played on radios, concerts, and became popular around their town of Tuzla. Numerous attempts and limited exposure on radio was a problem until 1999, when DJ Soul and Erol created the first Bosnian hip hop station FMJAM. With the help of FMJAM, the first songs were produced in a studio. After numerous shows, FMJAM helps create the hip hop group Disciplinska Komisija, with the lead rapper Edo Maajka, who would lead the revival movement in Bosnian hip hop. A little later FMJAM establishes themselves enough to be able to create a website, on which a number of demo songs were released on. With these demo songs and the organization that FMJAM provided, Bosnian hip hop for the first time had an organization to rely on to have the resources available to provide for future acts and organize concerts and hip hop gatherings for the youth. Although FMJAM played a large role in organizing Bosnian hip hop, it is recognized by the majority of media that Edo Maajka was the artist, with his 2002 debut album, that introduced hip hop to the majority of Bosnia, thus allowing FMJAM to continue their work. Diaspora Although different, Bosnian hip hop has also proven itself very popular and successful throughout the United States. With the introduction of the group Slicc & Aone, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bosnian hip hop made its debut in the United States. The duo gained popularity quickly, which also opened up a new path to oncoming Bosnian-American hip hop artists. Other notable Bosnian hip hop artists throughout the U.S. include Rima D, Rnel, Prah, Opijum Veza, Gazije, Udarna Snaga and KoCity RimeS.

Life  Winkler was born in 1838 in Freiberg, Kingdom of Saxony the son of a chemist who had studied under Berzelius. Winkler's early education was at schools in Freiberg, Dresden, and Chemnitz. In 1857 he entered the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, where his knowledge of analytical chemistry surpassed what he was being taught there. Sixteen years later, Winkler was appointed a professor of chemical technology and analytical chemistry at the university. Winkler was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892. In 1893, Winkler moved to Hamburg where he married his childhood sweetheart Tanja Braun. In 1902, Winkler resigned his professorship. He died in Dresden two years later of carcinoma at the age of 65. According to Brunck, Winkler wrote poetry, and according to McCay, Winkler's talents extended to playing several musical instruments. Discovery of germanium In 1886, Winkler was provided with a new mineral from the Himmelsfürst mine near Freiberg. The mineral, called argyrodite, was found by chemists to contain silver and sulfur. When Winkler subsequently analyzed the mineral, he found that the individual components only added up to about 93-94% of its total mass, leading him to suspect that a new and previously unknown element must be present. After additional chemical purification steps over several months, Winkler isolated the pure element, germanium, on February 6, 1886 and published his results. The mineral argyrodite that was Winkler's start toward finding germanium is now known to be a double sulfide with formula GeS2 · 4Ag2S. To place germanium into the periodic table, Mendeleev suggested that it might be ekacadmium, an element he had predicted earlier. In contrast, Lothar Meyer favored an identification of germanium with ekasilicon, a different predicted element. Winkler isolated more of the pure material, and eventually obtained enough to measure some of its physical and chemical properties. His results showed unequivocally that Meyer's interpretation was the correct one and that nearly all of the new element's properties matched Mendeleev predictions. The close match between what had been predicted for ekasilicon and what was found for germanium was clear evidence for the utility and power of the periodic table and the concept of periodicity.  Other work  In addition to his isolation and study of germanium, Winkler investigated the analysis of gases. He published a book on the subject, Handbook of Technical Gas Analysis, in 1884. In that book Winkler describes his invention of the three-way stopcock. He predicted the existence of silicon monoxide, SiO, and was the first to attempt to produce it by heating silica with silicon in 1890. However, he was unsuccessful because he was not able to heat the mixture to a high enough temperature using a combustion furnace. As no reaction occurred for him, Winkler incorrectly concluded that SiO does not exist, even though it was reported to have formed from the reduction of silica with charcoal three years earlier by C. F. Maybery. However, Henry Noel Potter, a Westinghouse engineer, repeated Winkler's experiment fifteen years later with an electric furnace, which enabled him to increase the reaction temperature by several hundred degrees and observe the generation of SiO.

It extends south from Wisconsin Highway 31 and Lake CR A1/19 (128th Street) at the Illinois/Wisconsin state line by Pleasant Prairie, south to Illinois Route 176 in Lake Bluff, a distance of .  Route description  Illinois 131 is called Green Bay Road for its entire length, but Green Bay Road becomes a residential street and extends south through various North Shore communities to Evanston, a distance of approximately south of Illinois 176. It is one of very few state routes whose named road is longer than the marked state road. Green Bay Road actually continues south to Old Elm Road (Lake CR 52) while there is a second segment of Green Bay Road that starts at a dead end in Highwood and ends at Ridge Avenue in Evanston. The road parallels U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway), which is only a few miles to the west, and Illinois Route 137 (Amstutz Expressway), which is only a few miles to the east. It is the major north-south road between those two expressways.  History  SBI Route 131 ran from Mattoon to Greenup in southeastern Illinois. This was dropped in 1937 for Illinois Route 121.

It is one of three major federal granting agencies (the others being the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Canadian Institutes for Health Research) that together are referred to as \\"the tri-council\\".  History  Created by an act of the Parliament of Canada in 1977, SSHRC reports to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development.  Governance  SSHRC creates policy, plans budgets, and directs priorities through a council established by the federal government. The appointed members are a mix of academics and representatives from the industry. They have the role of advising the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development on research policy in the areas of research and scholarship in the social sciences and humanities, with the goal of representing the interests of academic, public and private sectors. Council committees create and oversee SSHRC's programs, determine the distribution of funds and handles the strategies for enacting the councils policies.  Programs  SSHRC funding opportunities are available through three programs: Talent, Insight and Connection. = Talent program = The Talent program is to support students and postdoctoral candidates to become researchers and leaders across society, both within academia and across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. The program promotes research skills and assists in the training of highly qualified personnel in the social sciences and humanities. In this way, SSHRC fosters the development of talented and creative people who will become leaders across campuses and communities. = Insight program = The Insight program is to build knowledge and understanding about people, societies and the world by supporting research excellence in all subject areas eligible for funding from SSHRC. Research and training in the social sciences and humanities provide the foundation for a vibrant, healthy and prosperous society. They build knowledge and understanding about individuals, groups and societies. The program aims to support and foster excellence in social sciences and humanities research intended to deepen, widen and increase collective understanding of individuals and societies, as well as to inform the search for solutions to societal challenges. = Connection program = The Connection program is to realize the potential of social sciences and humanities research for intellectual, cultural, social and economic influence, benefit and impact on and beyond the campus by supporting specific activities and tools that facilitate the flow and exchange of research knowledge. Knowledge mobilization in the social sciences and humanities facilitates the multidirectional flow of research knowledge across academia and society as a whole, in order to inform Canadian and international research, debate, decisions and actions. Those who can benefit from publicly funded research results in the humanities and social sciences - diverse groups of researchers, policy-makers, business leaders, community groups, educators and the media. The program aims to support knowledge mobilization activities such as networking, disseminating, exchanging and co-creating research-based knowledge as an important element of publicly engaged scholarship, and as a means of strengthening research agendas. SSHRC also recognizes that rapidly evolving information and communications technologies provide new opportunities to engage a variety of audiences with an interest and/or involvement in social sciences and humanities scholarship. A program entitled Canada 150 Connection has been set up for the 150th anniversary of Canada to support activities by post-secondary institutions and researchers that explore the contributions of social sciences and humanities research to Canadian society.  Future challenge areas  In June 2013, SSHRC's governing council endorsed six future challenge areas developed during its Imagining Canada's Future initiative, with a goal of addressing Canada's future societal challenges and meeting future opportunities through social sciences and humanities research.

She is the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an organisation formed to fight for justice for the victims of communal violence in the state of Gujarat in 2002. CJP is a co-petitioner seeking a criminal trial of Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat and the current Prime minister of India and sixty-two other politicians and government officials for alleged complicity in the Gujarat riots of 2002 and whose names did not figure in any of the FIRs /charge sheets that formed the subject matter of the various Session Trials regarding the riots at that point of time. Four of the accused since then were charge-sheeted, of whom Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi have already been convicted. Maya Kodnani was acquitted by the Gujarat High Court in April 2018. Teesta Setalvad addressing a gathering at VJT Hall Trivandrum, Kerala Teesta Setalvad addressing a gathering at VJT Hall Trivandrum, Kerala Teesta Setalvad attending a meeting in Kerala Personal life Born in 1962 into a Gujarati Hindu family, Setalvad is the daughter of Atul Setalvad, a Mumbai-based lawyer, and his wife Sita Setalvad. Her paternal grandfather was M. C. Setalvad, India's first Attorney General. Setalvad is married to Javed Anand, a journalist turned minority rights activist. They have two children, a daughter and a son. Career In a public discussion at the Press club in March 2017, Teesta recounted that despite coming from a family steeped in a legal heritage, she decided to pursue a career in journalism after reading a book that her father had bought her called \\"All the President's men\\". She subsequently went to college, studied law for two years, dropped out and then graduated with a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Bombay University in 1983 and started work as a journalist. She reported for the Mumbai editions of The Daily (India) and The Indian Express newspapers, and later for Business India magazine. Her first brush with communal violence came when she covered the 1984 riots in 1984 in Bhiwandi. Setalvad's career as a mainstream journalist was a decade long. In 1993, in response to the Hindu-Muslim riots in Mumbai, she and her husband quit their regular jobs to start Communalism Combat, a monthly magazine. According to Javed Anand (Setalvad's husband and co-founder of Communalism Combat), the decision to break from mainstream journalism to start a magazine was because it was also a platform which gave them an opportunity to intervene in ways which they couldn't have otherwise. The last print copy of the magazine was printed in November 2012. Subsequently, they moved to the digital domain by starting a website, which has subsequently been inactive. Setalvad and her husband, along with others such as Father Cedric Prakash (a catholic priest), Anil Dharker (a journalist), Alyque Padamsee, Javed Akhtar, Vijay Tendulkar and Rahul Bose (all film & theatre personalities) set up an NGO named \\"Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP)\\" on 1 April 2002. The NGO forthwith began to litigate in various courts against the alleged complicity of the Chief Minister and government of Gujarat state in the riots that had broken out shortly before. Their efforts met with partial success in April 2004, when the Supreme Court of India transferred the \\"Best Bakery case\\" to the neighbouring state of Maharashtra. At the same time, the court also overturned the recent acquittal of 21 accused and ordered that the investigation and trial be conducted afresh. By 2013, all the cases filed by CPJ had been dismissed at three levels of the judiciary (trial court, state High Court and the Indian Supreme Court) and only one appeal is pending. This is an appeal to the Supreme Court against a conviction handed out by the High Court to Maya Kodnani, a former minister in the government of Gujarat. Teesta has authored the chapter When Guardians Betray:The Role of the Police in the book Gujarat:The making of a tragedy, edited by Siddharth Varadarajan and published by Penguin. The book is about the 2002 Gujarat riots. Activism * Teesta, with her husband Javed Anand is the co-founder and co-editor of the magazine Communalism Combat which fosters communal harmony by attacking entities propounding communal violence. * Teesta testified at the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom on 10 June 2002 against the BJP-led Gujarat government's role in the post-Godhra communal violence. * In 1997, Teesta started work on a project, Khoj (Quest), which aims to rewrite sections of Indian school History and Social Studies textbooks to remove \\"anti-minority prejudices\\". * Teesta is a staunch feminist and campaigns for rights and privileges of Dalits, Muslims and women. * Teesta's husband Javed Anand runs Sabrang Communications which fights for human rights. Teesta is the official spokesperson of this organisation. * Teesta heads the Mumbai-based NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP). * She is one of the founders of the Women in the Media Committee. The group seeks to bring together working women journalists to raise job-related concerns and awareness of gender-sensitivity in writing and reporting on issues concerning women. * She is one of the founding members of Journalists Against Communalism. * Apart from the journalistic tasks Teesta Setalvad leads the project \\"Khoj: Education for A pluralistic India\\". * Teesta is General Secretary of People's Union for Human Rights (PUHR). * Member of the Pakistan India People's Forum for Peace and Democracy.

Raghavan submitted his comments to the report for perusal of the Supreme Court on 14 May 2010 Further investigation report was filed in November 2010. The Supreme Court in November 2010 appointed Raju Ramachandran as amicus curiae to assist the court in this case. The amicus curiae submitted a note dated 20 January 2011 to the Supreme Court. On 15 March 2011, the Supreme Court directed SIT to examine the observations of the amicus curiae, to re- examine the entire evidence recorded and if some more evidence is required to be recorded, to do so. It observed that the SIT chairman's inferences did not match with the findings of the SIT probe. Thereafter the SIT examined more witnesses and recorded their statements and submitted a further investigation report on 24 April 2011. On 5 May 2011, during a hearing in the Supreme Court, Shanti Bhushan, the counsel for Zakia Jafri, alleged that SIT was a doing cover-up job and sought copies of the investigation reports. The amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran informed the court that he had received a copy of an affidavit filed by Sanjiv Bhatt that he was present at a 27 February 2002 meeting convened by the chief minister where instructions were given to teach Muslims a lesson.Go Beyond SIT Report on Jafri Case Court tells Amicus Curiae The Hindu 6 May 2011 retrieved on 12 August 2013 The Supreme Court ordered \\"The copies of the report, along with the comments of the chairman, be given to the amicus curiae, who shall analyse them in the light of evidence, statements of witnesses, and have his independent assessment of the entire evidence which has come on record\\".

The trial court on 10 April 2012 observed that SIT had not found any evidence for the prosecution of Modi or any of the top bureaucrats or police officials and had recommended that the investigation be closed. The court gave the complainant, Zakia Jafri, the option of filing a protest petition However SIT raised various objections to giving all the investigation papers to the petitioner and finally on 7 February 2013, the Supreme Court asked the SIT to hand over copies of all the reports and investigation papers to the petitioners.SC Allows Zakia to Access All Documents The Hindu 8 February 2013 Retrieved on 12 August 2013 The protest petition was filed on 15 April 20132002: Zakia Jafri Challenges SIT Clean Chit to Modi Outlook 15 April 2013 Retrieved on 12 August 2013 In April 2013, the SIT while opposing the protest petition filed by Zakia Jafri and CJP against SIT's closure report submitted before a local court that \\"Teesta Setalvad and others have falsified the complaint targeting the chief minister who had never said that go and kill people.\\" Their lawyer further submitted that the so-called incident of Chief Minister (Narendra Modi) giving instructions (in the meeting) to high-level police officers not to take action against the rioters is a sole creation of Teesta Setalvad. There is no evidence to the same and that Setalvad was not present during the incident. In their argument that sufficient grounds existed for ordering criminal prosecution of Modi, Zakia Jafri's counsel told the court that SIT which gave Modi a clean chit, itself behaved like a conspirator and glossed over a wealth of official evidence which suggested State complicity in the incidents Controversies =Allegations of witness tampering= In November 2010, Setalvad was accused of pressuring Zaheera Sheikh, the key witness in the Best Bakery case, to make certain statements, leading to the unprecedented transferral of the case outside Gujarat. In August 2005, the Supreme Court of India committee absolved her of the charges of inducement levelled against her by Zaheera and awarded a one-year jail sentence to Zaheera for perjury. In 2013 Tehelka in an undercover investigation discovered that Zaheera had been paid to alter her testimony. Tehelka recorded BJP member Madhu Srivastava, described by Tehelka as a \\"close associate of Narendra Modi\\" and Batthoo Srivastava describing how they had paid Rs 1.8 million to Zaheera. Teesta Setalvad's former aide Rais Khan Pathan has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court alleging manipulation of evidence, which were in the form of statements of witnesses, by her in five sensitive post-Godhra riot cases. In April 2009, the Times of India ran a story claiming that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Supreme Court of India to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riot cases had submitted before the Court that Teesta Setalvad had cooked up cases of violence to spice up the incidents. The SIT which is headed by former CBI director, R K Raghavan has said that false witnesses were tutored to give evidence about imaginary incidents by Teesta Setalvad and other NGOs. The SIT charged her of \\"cooking up macabre tales of killings\\". The court was told that 22 witnesses, who had submitted identical affidavits before various courts relating to riot incidents, were questioned by SIT and it was found that the witnesses had not actually witnessed the incidents and they were tutored and the affidavits were handed over to them by Setalvad. The report which was brought to the notice of the bench consisting of Justices Arijit Pasayat, P Sathasivam and Aftab Alam, noted that the much publicised case of a pregnant Muslim woman Kausar Bano being gangraped by a mob and foetus being removed with sharp weapons, was also fabricated, and false. However, Kausar Bano's husband states alleges the doctors falsified the post-mortem despite his wife's uterus having been removed from her body. The court that was trying the issue found beyond reasonable doubt that Babu Bajarangi killed Kausar Bano and her nine-month-old foetus by stabbing her in the stomach with a sword, but did not find sufficient evidence to prove that he removed the foetus from the uterus.< A day later, the Times of India published a letter from Citizens for Justice and Peace claiming that the report in question was not SIT report but a report by the Gujarat Government. The author of the Times article responded saying \\"My report was based on the SIT report and not any document circulated by the Gujarat government, as suggested by CJP. Whether any section of the media has the report or not is irrelevant as TOI has access to the report. R.K. Raghavan, the chairman of the SIT criticised the report leakage, saying, \\"The alleged reported leaks appear to be inspired by dubious motives. I cannot confirm such claims. The act is highly condemnable\\". However, he refused to deny or confirm whether the leaked contents were true.Nagender Sharma, Gujarat riots witnesses not tutored: SIT, Apr 22, 2009, Hindustan Times The Supreme Court itself condemned the leaking of the SIT report as a 'betrayal of trust' but did not deny the report itself. Raghvan noted that \\"many incidents were cooked up, false witnesses were tutored to give evidence about imaginary incidents, and false charges levelled against the then Ahmedabad police chief P C Pandey\\".Guj Riots: Activist accused of 'cooking up tales' – Oneindia News.

An article in Pragati stated that her grandstanding has undermined the foundations of the beliefs of the Indian republicTampering with evidence Pragati – May 2009 =Allegations of misappropriation of funds= In 2013, twelve residents of the Gulbarg Society who were the victim of Gujarat riots, accused Setalvad of collecting donations in the name of riot victims but failing to use them for their benefit and sent a legal notice to her. They claimed that she had collected huge donations from national and international organisations in the name of providing financial assistance for reconstruction of houses or developing the society into a museum but it was not passed to the members of the society. They also sought to ban her organisation \\"Citizens for Justice and Peace\\" and prevent them entering the society to organise programmes. The Ahmedabad Crime Branch is conducting an inquiry into the matter. On 13 March 2013, the official representatives including the secretary and chairman of the Gulbarg Cooperative Housing Society in a letter to the joint commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, informed him that the letter-head of the society had been misused by some residents and the claims being made by them were patently false since nothing had been parted from them. A similar letter was also released to the media. In a press release CJP and Sabrang clarified that CJP never sought nor received any money for the museum. Sabrang Trust had raised an amount of Rs 460,285 nationally and internationally from donors for the purpose of the museum and since the plan has been abandoned because of the spiralling real estate prices, the matter is between the trust and the donors which they will address when final decision is taken. All other funds, nationally and internationally raised, have been funds legitimately collected for activities that they publicly engage in. Their accounts are audited and submitted to the relevant authorities. Subsequent to the letter written by the Gulbarg Society members to the police, the police sent them a letter asking for the status quo to be maintained while investigations were in progress. Later, the Crime Branch claimed that the complaint did not have any substance and instead filed an FIR against Setalvad. After a First Information Report was filed by the Ahmedabad police on 4 January 2014 Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand were granted interim bail. According to the judge, similar relief has been provided in the past when false allegations were raised. The bail application stated that \\"The FIR is a mala fide action of the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, to intimidate a human rights defender. This is the fifth time that a false criminal case has been lodged since 2004 because of me and my organization's consistent legal support to the victims of 2002 riots ... Gulbarga cooperative housing society had been totally burnt down by politically motivated anti-social elements and 68 people had lost their lives in the massacre.\\" It also said the accusation was brought by \\"powerful forces in Gujarat who wish(ed) to stymie the appeal in the Zakia Jafri case\\". On finding that the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad instead of acting on his complaint had filed an FIR against Setalvad and others, the Secretary of the Gulbarg Housing Society, Firoz Gulzar Pathan moved the court complaining against Gujarat police's biased approach. The court sought a report from the Crime Branch. The Police responded by claiming that the complaint did not have any substance. This was countered by the complainant's advocate who maintained that the Crime Branch had not even bothered to question the complainant before shelving the complaint. This led the magisterial court on 15 February 2014 to direct the city crime branch to lodge an FIR and start investigation against former residents of Gulbarg Society who had made the complaint against Setalvad last year. On 28 November 2014, local court rejected pleas filed by activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and their two NGOs seeking to de-freeze their bank accounts attached earlier by police in connection with the embezzlement case. On 12 February 2015, Gujarat High Court rejected Setalvad's anticipatory bail plea regarding the case. However she was given an interim protection by the Supreme Court of India and on 19 March 2015, a two- judge bench of the Court referred the issue involved in her case to a large three-judge bench. = Alleged violation of the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act = A private organisation in India can accept donations from abroad only if it is registered under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act. Teesta's Sabrang Communications and Publishing (not registered under FCRA) had between 2004 and 2014 accepted $290,000 from the US-based Ford Foundation without the government approval .The Ford Foundation, one of the largest international donors, was put on the watch-list following a Gujarat government complaint that it was interfering in India's \\"internal affairs\\" and encouraging Teesta's NGOs to promote \\"communal disharmony\\". Ford Foundation has been accused of such allegations in another country also. It is also alleged that Ford Foundation had a deep penetration into Nehru Government =Allegation that Teesta is being framed and hounded= Though cases against Teesta are still in courts it has been suggested by some journalists that Teesta is being framed and hounded by Gujarat Police because of her criticism of Narendra Modi, It is alleged that allegations of corruption against Teesta are concocted .

Its western terminus is at the Iowa state line, connecting with U.S. Route 52 (US 52) and Iowa Highway 64 via the Savanna-Sabula Bridge at the Mississippi River west of Savanna. IL 64 then travels east through Mount Carroll, Lanark, Mount Morris, Oregon, Sycamore, Lily Lake, Saint Charles and the western suburbs of Chicago before terminating at U.S. Route 41 (US 41, Lake Shore Drive) on the city's north side. IL 64 is long. Route description Eastbound endpoint of IL 64 at US 41 North Avenue Bridge over the Chicago River, looking east Damen Blue Line station alt=A steel cantilever-truss bridge arches gracefully over a tree-lined river. IL 64 overlaps US 52 between the Iowa state line and Brookville—a distance of over —so that the IL 64 designation can carry over to Iowa. East of the Mississippi River, IL 64 is largely a rural, undivided surface road from Savanna to the Fox River in Saint Charles. At St. Charles, IL 64 enters the Chicago metro area and becomes a four-lane road, taking on the name of Main Street. Just east of St. Charles, IL 64 becomes North Avenue and retains this designation until just before its terminus in Chicago at US 41 (Lake Shore Drive). At IL 59, the road widens further from four to six lanes and becomes a divided highway until its intersection with IL 83 in Elmhurst. From Elmhurst to Interstate 294 (I-294) it remains a four-lane surface street, but it widens to a six-lane divided highway once again through the towns of Stone Park and Northlake. At the Des Plaines River and IL 43, North Avenue becomes four lanes until it reaches North Western Avenue. At this point, it becomes at times a two-lane road, for the rest of its route through Chicago. One-half mile (0.8 km) west of US 41, IL 64 turns north onto LaSalle Boulevard, and then east, before terminating at Lake Shore Drive. North Avenue is a main east–west artery in Chicago itself, and one of only seven state routes to enter the city. It is located at the 1600 North parallel of Chicago. Just east of the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/I-94), the North Avenue Bridge carries IL 64 over the North Branch of the Chicago River. The hybrid suspension/cable-stayed bridge was built in 2006, replacing a bascule bridge dating back to 1907. Between Halsted Street and Sheffield Avenue, North Avenue has become a shopping destination, known as the Clybourn Corridor.  History  St. Charles State Bond Initiative Route 64 was IL 64 from Sycamore to Chicago. The portion of the road in DuPage County was put through in 1928, the first highway through the county. In 1937, the road was extended west from Sycamore to what was then US 51 (and is now IL 251). Afterwards, it was extended further west to US 52, and then following it to the state line. Much like IL 92, there is no particular reason for extending IL 64 through Iowa and Nebraska, as existing U.S. Routes served any major cities on the State Route 64s better.  Major junctions   Truck route  IL 64 has one alternate route; Illinois Route 64 Truck (IL 64 Truck), a bypass around a truck-prohibited, residential section of Elmhurst. Eastbound truck traffic is rerouted north along IL 83, east along US 20 (Lake Street) and then onto I-290 before being allowed to return to IL 64. Westbound truck traffic follows the same route in reverse. As early as 1989, the City of Elmhurst had sought to block trucks from traveling on North Avenue through its city limits. For a time, Illinois House of Representatives minority leader Lee Daniels supported a plan to reduce North Avenue from four lanes to two, prohibiting trucks from traveling through the residential neighborhood. By 1994, the village had agreed to reconstruct North Avenue and add a single set of left-turn lanes at Myrtle Avenue. Reconstruction of North Avenue in Elmhurst took place in 1997.

BBC News, August 17, 1999.Coury Turczyn, \\"Geek Love\\" , PopCult Magazine, April 15, 1999. It was founded in Seattle in 1991 by Jim Rose and his wife BeBe Aschard Rose. The sideshow came to prominence to an American audience as a second stage show at the 1992 Lollapalooza festival, then called the \\"Jim Rose Circus Sideshow\\", although they had toured the Northwest and Canada and had several US TV appearances before this time. Rolling Stone magazine called the show an \\"absolute must-see act\\" and USA Today termed Rose's troupe \\"Lollapalooza's word-of-mouth hit attraction\\". Tours After Lollapalooza, in 1993 Jim Rose headlined seven world tours and released a self-titled video on Rick Rubin's American Recordings that quickly became a cult classic. In 1994, the Jim Rose Circus was chosen to tour with Nine Inch Nails, Pop Will Eat Itself and a then-unknown Marilyn Manson, and later with KoRn and Godsmack. 1998 saw another world tour featuring female sumo wrestling, Mexican transvestite wrestling and chainsaw football. The show landed Rose and troupe in jail in Lubbock, Texas and for four months the show was banned from New Zealand. Jim Rose was also the top ticket of the Melbourne (Australia), New Zealand and Edinburgh (Scotland) Fringe and Comedy Festivals. Performers Jim Rose in 2005 Rose himself performs in between acts, mostly comedy but often stunts as well such as attaching paper currency to his forehead with a staple gun, driving a long nail into his nostril and having darts thrown into his back. During the show's final act, he would escape from a straitjacket. His most outrageous trick followed: he would invite audience members to stand on his head after he had placed it in a shallow crate of broken glass. * The Amazing Mister Lifto (Joe Hermann) who hung heavy weights (cinder blocks, steam irons, beer kegs, etc.) from his body piercings, including those in his nipples and genitalia. At Lollapalooza Lifto would perform the \\"genital lift\\" feat after spraying shaving cream on himself. * Bebe the Circus Queen (Beatrice Aschard) would perform a variety of stunts such as having a watermelon placed on her back and split with a sword, lying on a bed of nails while weights were placed on her chest... or the \\"Plastic Bag Of Death\\", where she gets into a large plastic bag and one of the other performers sucks all of the air out with a vacuum cleaner. She would also employ an electric grinder in her act (for example, she would create a shower of sparks from a metal chastity belt covering her groin area). * Matt \\"The Tube\\" Crowley, whose moniker came from the seven feet of tubing that he would swallow. The other end of the tube was attached to a crude hand pump. Rose himself would fill the pump with a variety of fluids and proceed to pump it into Crowley's stomach, then back out again. Audience members were invited onstage to drink the vile concoction after it had been extricated from Crowley. He would also provide a demonstration of sheer lung power by blowing up a hot water bottle with his mouth until it burst. Other gags included sucking a black condom in through his mouth and out his nose (and reversing the procedure) and working a long piece of plastic fluorescent cord through his nasal passages in order to \\"floss\\" his nose. * Zamora the Torture King (Tim Cridland) had a segment that featured him walking barefoot up and down a ladder of razor sharp sabres, piercing himself with long needles and meat skewers, eating pieces of a broken lightbulb (he would hold a microphone near his mouth so the audience would hear the sound), and touching an electrical generator while holding a fluorescent lightbulb that would glow. * The Enigma (Paul Lawrence), originally known as Slug, was billed as a man who would eat anything (including slugs, worms, and grasshoppers), and swallow a variety of swords. He also doubled as the show's organ player. His body is completely tattooed with blue jigsaw puzzle pieces. * The Lizardman performed by Eric Sprague (born 1972) is a completely tattooed performer with a surgically split tongue (featured on Ripley's Believe It or Not) joined Jim in 1999 on the Godsmack Voodoo Tour and in 2001 toured with just Jim and Bebe doing comedy clubs. He performed several acts previously done by members who had left. * Cappy (David Capurro) is an award-winning yoyo artist. Featured in The Jim Rose Twisted Tour. * Rupert (Ryan Stock) performed the traditional sideshow stunts. He now stars in his own show on the Discovery Channel with partner Amber Lynn. * John Chaos performs traditional stunts. He later staged his own one-man show, the John Chaos Sideshow, mixing classic and new stunts with offbeat humor and magic tricks. Chaos still performs with the Jim Rose Circus from time to time. * Jake \\"the Snake\\" Roberts * SiNn BoHdi formally known as Kizarny of the WWE * Brianna Belladonna, a female sword swallower who performed at Sturgis with the circus in 2010. * Jimmy Coffin, a working act. Later he toured the USA as a solo sideshow artist as the \\"Jimmy Coffin Sideshow\\". * \\"Fat Matt\\" Alaeddine, billed as the world's fattest contortionist Television and other media Jim Rose was featured in the Season 2 episode of The X-Files, \\"Humbug\\"; the episode was set in a community of sideshow and former sideshow workers. Homer Simpson runs away and joins the Jim Rose Circus as a cannonball catcher (not to be confused with a human cannonball) on the episode \\"Homerpalooza\\" of The Simpsons. The Jim Rose Circus Sideshow video tape (1993 American Recordings) was re-released in 2003 as a DVD by Moonshine Music. The Jim Rose Twisted Tour was a seven-episode series that debuted March 2003 on the opening week of the Travel Channel, although only five episodes were aired. It was released in 2006 on DVD, which includes all episodes. Jim Rose appeared in the movie Doubting Riley, a film by HBO's Project Greenlight alumni. Rose voiced the psychotic character Psymon Stark in the video games SSX Tricky and Sled Storm. Publications Jim Rose wrote the autobiographical Freak Like Me (Real, Raw, and Dangerous) with journalist Melissa Rossi in 1995 (). The book describes Rose's early years and features a stream of consciousness on-the-road account of the Jim Rose Circus tour with Lollapalooza. The book's title is a reference to Black Like Me. Rose also released the book 'Snake Oil (Life's Calculations, Misdirections, And Manipulations) in 2005. Rose was written about extensively in Marilyn Manson's autobiography 'Long Hard Road Out Of Hell'. The stories refer to the 1994 'Downward Spiral Tour' with Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails. Politics According to an interview with Oddities Magazine, Jim Rose claims to have been involved in fundraising for the Mo Udall political campaign during a time in his life when he was addicted to heroin. He was quoted as stating that \\"[Mo] ran against Jimmy Carter and I was his fundraiser... I used to do fundraisers with like Gregory Peck and Robert Redford, actually while I was on heroin. They didn’t know... actually I forgot to tell them.\\" Consultant Rose has been hired by corporations including Microsoft and regularly speaks as a consultant for PR firms; in this regard he has been pictured on the cover of The Wall Street Journal and Fast Company, and is featured in the marketing book The Deviant's Advantage. In 2008 Rose was hired as spokesperson and performer for Dos Equis in the \\"Jim Rose Most Interesting Show In The World\\" U.S tour. Rose has also served as a spokesman for Gordon's Gin. Reception Rolling Stone described the circus as an \\"absolute must-see act\\". The Independent praised the show as \\"brutally comic\\", adding that Rose \\"plays the highly-strung audience like a violin\\". Melody Maker compared the \\"revolted amusement\\" of the audience to that of tourists at a bullfight. British Circus proprietor Gerry Cottle said, \\"I've seen a lot of things in my time. I must see 40 circuses a year, but this lot... They came on in their street clothes and then... They're beyond anything I've ever seen. They shocked me.\\" The Times Magazine said that while it may not be everyone's idea of entertainment, it certainly did not deserve to be banned.

It was created by The Treaty of June 9, 1855 between the United States and members of the Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla tribes. It lies in northeastern Oregon, east of Pendleton. The reservation is mostly in Umatilla County, with a very small part extending south into Union County. It is managed by the three Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Located on the north side of the Blue Mountains, the reservation was established for two Sahaptin-speaking Native American tribes: the Umatilla and Walla Walla, and for the Cayuse, whose language, now extinct, was an isolate. All the tribes historically inhabited the Columbia Plateau region. The tribes share land and a governmental structure as part of their confederation. Geography, demographics and headquarters The reservation has a land area of and a tribal population of 2,927 as of the 2000 census. In addition, some 300 Native Americans from other regional tribes and 1,500 non-natives live on the reservation.\\"Who We Are\\" (January 2013) , Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation The largest community is Mission, which is the site of the tribal headquarters as well as the Umatilla Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some BIA agency offices serve more than one federally recognized tribe, but the Umatilla Agency exclusively serves the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR). History The tribes developed the Wildhorse Casino Resort on their reservation to generate revenues for their people. The casino is located near Interstate 84. In 2006 it started Cayuse Technologies, to provide software development and related services. These enterprises employ 1,000 persons and have markedly reduced unemployment. Pendleton photographer Walter S. Bowman photographed tribe members in the early 20th century. The CTUIR founded the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, a museum that provides both historical and contemporary exhibits related to the confederated tribes, as well as exhibits of contemporary Native American arts and traditional craftwork.

Roughly speaking, Stein factorization contracts the connected components of the fibers of a mapping to points. Statement One version for schemes states the following: > Let X be a scheme, S a locally noetherian scheme and f: X to S a proper > morphism. Then one can write :f = g circ f' where gcolon S' to S is a > finite morphism and f'colon X to S' is a proper morphism so that f'_* > mathcal{O}_X = mathcal{O}_{S'}. The existence of this decomposition itself is not difficult. See below. But, by Zariski's connectedness theorem, the last part in the above says that the fiber f'^{-1}(s) is connected for any s in S. It follows: Corollary: For any s in S, the set of connected components of the fiber f^{-1}(s) is in bijection with the set of points in the fiber g^{-1}(s).  Proof  Set: :S' = operatorname{Spec}_S f_* mathcal{O}_X where SpecS is the relative Spec. The construction gives the natural map gcolon S' to S, which is finite since mathcal{O}_X is coherent and f is proper. The morphism f factors through g and one gets f'colon X to S', which is proper. By construction, f'_* mathcal{O}_X = mathcal{O}_{S'}. One then uses the theorem on formal functions to show that the last equality implies f' has connected fibers.

Biography Hellmayr was born in Vienna and studied at the University of Vienna, although he did not complete his degree. After his studies he worked in Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Paris, Tring (England), and Chicago. He spent the years 1905–1908 studying Baron Rothschild's private collection of natural history specimens at Tring, near London. There he received guidance from the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert. In 1908 Hellmayr was appointed Curator of the Bird Department at the Bavarian State Museum, which he had helped organize in 1903 and where he became a specialist in Neotropical birds, studying Johann Baptist von Spix's collection of Brazilian birds. In 1922 he was made Curator in Zoology at the Field Museum in Chicago. He stayed there until 1931. His books included 13 of the 15 volumes of the Catalogue of Birds of the Americas (1918–1949), a work initiated by Hellmayr's predecessor, Charles B. Cory. With Henry Boardman Conover he published The Birds of Chile. In 1931 Hellmayr went back to Vienna. After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, he was arrested and briefly jailed for reasons that are not fully known but probably related to his unsympathic views toward the Nazi Party (Hellmayr did not make political statements in public, but his interest – as an amateur historian – in the French Revolution shows that he was more than casually interested in such topics). After his release he emigrated with his wife to Switzerland. Following a long period of declining health he died in 1944 in Orselina, near Locarno. Historian François Vuilleumier writes that \\"Hellmayr's pivotal role was first and foremost to bring order to [the] nomenclatural chaos\\" of his day that had resulted in erroneous citations and hindered analysis of species and genera.

Lawrence owned eight Broughs: 1922: Boa (short for Boanerges) 1923: George I (£150 was more than the price of a house) 1924: George II 1925: George III 1926: George IV 1927: George V (RK 4907; see photo) 1929: George VI (UL 656) 1932: George VII (GW 2275) (the bike he died riding) Undelivered: George VIII (still being built when Lawrence was killed). T. E. Lawrence's seventh Brough Superior, GW 2275, the one on which he had his fatal crash. It is at the Imperial War Museum. Brough Superior ( ) motorcycles, sidecars, and motor cars were made by George Brough in his Brough Superior works on Haydn Road in Nottingham, England, from 1919 to 1940. The motorcycles were dubbed the \\"Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles\\" by H. D. Teague of The Motor Cycle newspaper. Approximately 3048 motorcycles (19 models) were made in the 21 years of production; around a third of that production still exists. T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") owned eight of these motorcycles and died from injuries sustained when he crashed number seven; the eighth was on order. Moving forward to 2008, vintage motorcycle enthusiast Mark Upham acquired the rights to the Brough Superior name. In 2013 he met motorcycle designer Thierry Henriette and asked him to design a new Brough Superior motorcycle. Three months later a prototype of a new SS100 was shown in Milan. History George Brough was a racer, designer, and showman - his father William E. Brough had been making Brough Motorcycles in Nottingham since 1908, and continued to do so until 1926. Convinced he could improve on his father's designs, all Brough Superior motorcycles were high performance and superior quality. Most were custom-built to the customer's needs, and rarely were any two of the same configuration. Each motorcycle was assembled twice. The first assembly was to fit all the components. Then the motorcycle was disassembled and all the parts painted or plated as needed. Finally, the finished parts were assembled a second time. Every motorcycle was test ridden to ensure that it performed to specification, and was personally certified by George Brough. The SS100 model was ridden at or more before delivery. The SS80 model was ridden at or more before delivery. If any motorcycle did not meet specification, it was returned to the works for rework until it performed properly. The fit and finish was comparable to a Rolls-Royce car, and they were the most expensive road-going motorcycles in the world. Brough Superior motorcycles have always been rare and expensive. Prices for these motorcycles ranged from £100 to £185 in the 1920s and 1930s. Since the average annual salary in Britain during the 1930s was £200, only the wealthy could afford them. In 1940, World War II brought an end to production as the factory was engaged on war work, completing crankshafts for Rolls Royce Merlin engines.. After hostilities had ceased there were no suitable engines available so the company was wound up. In 2004, around 1,000 Brough Superior motorcycles still existed, maintained by enthusiasts. In 2016 eight Brough Superior motorcycles were found which had been gathering dust and rust in a barn in Bodmin in Cornwall for 50 years.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3359441/Collection-rare-Brough- Superior-motorcycles-discovered-barn-gathering-dust-50-years.html Brough Superior motorcycles Early models include the Brough Superior Mark I Sidevalve, Mark I Overhead, Mark II Standard and Mark II Sports. Early to mid manufacture included the Overhead 500, 680 S.V. Junior, and 750 Side Valve, but these were not popular and were dropped from production. The following four models represent the bulk of manufacture. Most were custom built to order and many variations were made: * The SS100 (Super Sports), powered by J.A.P. (J. A. Prestwich of Tottenham) or Matchless 1000 cc overhead valve V-twin engines. Approximately 383 were manufactured from 1924 to 1940. * The SS80 (Super Sports), powered by J.A.P. or Matchless 1,000 cc sidevalve V-twin engines. Approximately 1,086 were manufactured from 1922 to 1940. * The 680 O.H.V., powered by J.A.P. 680 cc overhead valve V-twin. Approximately 547 were manufactured from 1926 to 1936. * The 11.50, powered by J.A.P 1096 cc sidevalve 60° V-twin engines. These were primarily designed for sidecar and police use. Approximately 308 were manufactured from 1933 to 1940. The model name refers to the horsepower rating of the engine, 11 RAC (Royal Automobile Club), . In reality these engines produced under 30 bhp (under 22 kW). Tax horsepower ratings were required by manufactures for tax purposes. RAC HP equals the piston diameter squared times the number of cylinders divided by 2.5. Brough Superior produced many other experimental, show, and racing models. These include: *Golden Dream. This was powered by a vertically stacked twin crankshaft opposed four cylinder engine. George Brough called this a \\"flat vertical\\" engine, which used a shaft final drive. The bike was finished in gold paint for the London Motorcycle Show. It was unveiled at the motorcycle show at Earls Court in 1938. *Brough Superior Austin Four or BS4. This bike was powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile engine and transmission. As the prop-shaft of the automotive transmission emerged in the center of the motorcycle's driveline, George Brough used two rear wheels mounted to a central, cast final drive unit. As the rear wheels were within 24\\" of each other, the Brough Superior 3-wheeler was legally considered a 'motorcycle' in the UK. It remains the only motorcycle in history to use this configuration. The Brough-Austin Four was intended for sidecar use, although one was ordered without a sidecar by journalist Hubert Chantry, who had borrowed a factory show model for use in the Land's End Trial of 1932.http://thevintagent.blogspot.mx/2015/12/the-last-great-brough-hoard.html 10 examples were built. *Pendine. This was introduced in 1927 and had a guaranteed top speed of . They were based on the SS100 model but with higher performance modifications to the engine. A well known racer, Barry Baragwanath, installed a supercharger on one, and it is now known as \\"Barry's Big Blown Brough\\". Noel Pope bought the motorcycle and in 1939 set two lap records with it at Brooklands; with sidecar, and in solo configuration, which exceeded the previous record set in 1935 by Eric Fernihough also on a Brough Superior. These records still stand as the track closed in 1939. George Brough was known for his dedication to his vehicles and customers. He, and later Albert Wallis, continued to service Brough Superiors after production ceased, making parts until 1969. To all intents and purposes production of bikes never resumed after WWII. =Production figures= * 1919 - 1 * 1920 - 1 * 1921 - 3 * 1922 - 103 * 1923 - 119 * 1924 - 195 * 1925 - 168 * 1926 - 95 * 1927 - 226 * 1928 - 155 * 1929 - 139 * 1930 - 131 * 1931 - 117 * 1932 - 58 * 1933 - 121 * 1934 - 104 * 1935 - 94 * 1936 - 187 * 1937 - 173 * 1938 - 159 * 1939 - 118 * 1940 - 10 To this list may be added thirteen motorcycles without a date on their build card. Many records are incomplete for the first few years of production and for some of the low production models. The estimated total production was 3,048 vehicles. = Racing = Riders of Brough Superiors have won many races—sprints (drag racing), hillclimbs, and top speed.

In 2013 Brough Superior said it would return to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with a prototype machine for Moto2, the Carbon2, a motorcycle made by California builders Taylormade and rebranded as a Brough Superior. Brough Superior sidecars Brough Superior also manufactured sidecars. The sidecars had coach-built bodies, and some carried a spare tyre, while others offered two seats for occasional use. The fit and finish of these sidecars were of the highest standard, as were the motorcycles. These sidecars all offered good protection from the elements. Many of the earlier sidecars were built to Brough Superior specification, while later sidecar frames were manufactured in the Brough Superior factory. Later sidecars were unique in the fact that the frame of the sidecar held fuel. The sidecar frame looped over the top of the sidecar body and had a filler cap at the topmost position. Fuel was pressurized by a hand pump that transferred fuel from the sidecar to the petrol tank on the motorcycle. Two different bodies could be ordered for the petrol tube sidecar; cruiser or sports. The various sidecars were offered in the yearly Brough Superior sales catalogs: *1921: \\"Sporting Sidecar\\" manufactured by Montgomery Sidecars to Brough Superior Specifications. *1922: \\"Sidecar\\" registered to the design of the manufacturer. *1923: \\"Brough Superior Sidecar\\" registered to the design of the manufacturer. *1924: \\"Brough Superior Sidecar\\", \\"Brough Superior Swallow Coupe\\", \\"Brough Superior Sporting\\", \\"Brough Superior Sporting Tourist\\". *1925: \\"Brough Superior Sporting Sidecar\\", \\"Brough Superior Touring Sidecar\\". *1926: \\"Brough Superior Super Sports Sidecar\\", and made mention of other sidecars available. *1927: \\"Brough Superior Touring Sports\\" was mentioned in the 1928 catalog mentions the popularity of it in 1927.

Brough Superior cars George Brough made approximately 85 cars named Brough Superior. Built between 1935 and 1939, they were powered by Hudson engines and had a Hudson chassis. Three models were made, but only two reached production. Early cars did not carry Brough Superior badges as Brough thought the cars sufficiently distinctive in themselves. The first car was the 4 litre made from May 1935 to 1936 using a , 4,168 cc side valve, straight-eight engine. Performance was remarkable for the time with a top speed of and a 0- time of under 10 seconds. Only a four-seat drop head was available with coachwork by W.C Atcherley of Birmingham. 19 were made and nine are known to have survived. This Brough designed, Atcherly coachwork of classic lines has steel guards, aluminium body over ash frame and is handsome, strong and durable. Unrestored examples are still roadworthy over 80 years later. Hudson Canada stopped supplying the eight-cylinder engine and chassis kits in 1936, and subsequent cars had a , 3,455 cc straight-six, still with side valves and called the 3.5 litre. A Centric supercharged version was also listed with a claimed output of . The chassis was shorter than the 4 litre at 116 inches. Saloon bodies were available but most were open cars. Approximately 80 were made between 1936 and 1939. The final car, the XII made in 1938, used a Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine of 4,387 cc and Brough's own design of chassis with Girling brakes and Ford axles. Only one was made with a saloon body built by Charlesworth. A large car with an overall length of and width of , it still survives. Journalist Bill Boddy tested an early model Brough Superior Saloon in 1936 for Motor Sport magazine. Noting the car had a reserve fuel tank, he declined to fill up before the journey. Upon running out of petrol, he could not find the switch to activate the reserve. After begging petrol from a passing lorry Boddy then encountered a motorcyclist who had crashed, and offered to help. When asked, he told Boddy that his bike was a Brough Superior and asked what was, \\"...the nice car in which you are giving me a lift.\\" When told it was a Brough Superior the motorcyclist was silent for the rest of the journey. Boddy presumed this was incredulity that a famed motorcycle maker could also manufacture cars, and supposed that the motorcyclist presumed he was concussed. Etymology The Brough surname, as with many English surnames that look like placenames, probably arose because one of George Brough's male-line ancestors came from one of several places in Britain so called. It is originally a form of the word \\"borough\\". \\"Superior\\" was a claim by George Brough of his bike's superiority over all other motorcycles, including the original Brough Motorcycles manufactured by his father, William E. Brough. Revival The Brough Superior make and name was purchased by a Jersey-registered corporation, with Mark Upham as CEO.http://www.brough- superior.com/ws/frontend/seite/SeiteCms.php?coId=124&coType;=navigation1http://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike- reviews/brough-superior/ss100/2016/ Upham produced several 'continuation' examples of ca.1926 Brough Superior SS100s,http://thevintagent.blogspot.mx/2009/09/road-test-of-new-brough- superior-ss101.html and negotiated with Thierry Henriette of Boxer Design (Toulouse, France) to produce a newly designed Brough Superior motorcycle. Upham insisted on retaining visual cues linking the new motorcycle with the historic Brough Superior design, as well as retaining the original ethos of the Brough Superior marque - innovation, excellent design, and superior construction and materials. The new Boxer-designed Brough Superior SS100 first appeared at the EICMA show in Milan in 2013; serial production began in 2016.http://www.cycleworld.com/2017-brough-superior-ss100-road-test- motorcycle-review The new Brough Superior SS100 features an 88degree, 990cc v-twin engine, with water cooling and DOHC four-valve cylinder heads, designed and built by Boxer Design. The engine produces 120 hp in standard tune, and the chassis uses the engine as a stressed member, with a Fior-based front fork with Ohlins shock absorber, with Ohlins monoshock rear suspension. The chassis is made entirely of exotic materials, including titanium, carbon fiber, and aluminum. The front brakes are from Beringer, with four rotors, sourced from the aircraft industry. The minimal bodywork is constructed of hand-hammered aluminum, including the fuel tank, seat cowl, fenders, and side covers. The dry weight of the SS100 is just under 400 lbs, making it among the lightest 'litre bikes' ever produced for street use.http://www.cycleworld.com/2017-brough-superior-ss100-road-test-motorcycle- review#page-2 Press reaction to the new SS100 has been generally (albeit not universally) positive. Road tests have praised the smooth engine, excellent handling, and contemporary performance, with some journalist praising the overall design aesthetic, although this seems a point of contention.

Operational history Pintado was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, 7 May 1943; launched 15 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Antonio Prince; and commissioned 1 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander Bernard A. Clarey in command. Pintado departed Portsmouth 17 February 1944 for torpedo trials at Newport, training out of New London, and antisubmarine warfare tactics and experiments with torpedo developments out of Key West. She sailed for the Pacific 31 March, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived Pearl Harbor 23 April. =World War II=  First patrol, May – July 1944  On her first war patrol, Pintado served as flagship of a wolfpack, commanded by Captain Leon P. Blair, which also included submarines and . The attack group departed Pearl Harbor 16 May, touched at Midway 20 May – 21 May, and headed for waters west of the Marianas and south of Formosa. On 31 May, they formed a scouting line in search of a convoy reported by submarine . After sparring with the convoy's escorts through the night, Pintado managed to reach attack position shortly before dawn and fired a spread of six torpedoes at overlapping targets, destroying the 4,716 ton cargo ship Toho Maru. She then daringly came within of an escort while bringing her stern tubes to bear on another merchant ship. Although explosions suggested that some of the second spread of torpedoes had scored, no second sinking has been confirmed. Pintado then skillfully evaded angry Japanese destroyers and sped away to safety. About midday on 4 June, Pintado spotted smoke from a Japanese convoy heading toward Saipan. She and her sister subs headed for the enemy, and soon Shark sank 6,886-ton cargo ship Katsunkawa Maru before slipping away from a heavy depth charge attack. The American submarines continued to shadow the convoy and early the next day Shark's torpedoes accounted for two more cargo ships. Pintado made her kills shortly before noon of 6 June, D-Day in Normandy, with a spread of torpedoes at overlapping targets. An awesome explosion tore one ship apart, her bow and stern both projecting up in the air as she sank. The stern of a second was under water before she was swallowed by smoke and flame. These victims were later identified as 5,652-ton Havre Maru and 2,825-ton Kashimasan Maru. An airplane and five escorts tried to box in the submarine and dropped over 50 depth charges, but she escaped damage. Pintado and her sisters in the wolfpack had all but destroyed the convoy which was attempting to reinforce Japanese defenses of the Marianas. While escorts rescued many of the 7,000 troops whose ships had gone down, they had lost weapons, tanks, and equipment. This greatly weakened Japan's defensive capability in the Marianas for the impending American invasion of Saipan. Pintado then headed for the Marshall Islands, arriving Majuro 1 July for refit.  Second patrol, July – September 1944  Her second war patrol took the submarine to the East China Sea. On 6 August she sank 5,401-ton cargoship Shonan Maru and damaged another target in a Formosa-bound convoy, before scampering away through a downpour of exploding depth charges. On 22 August Pintado spotted an 11-ship convoy guarded by three escorts. After dark she moved into the center of the convoy, passing a scant from an escort, to attack Tonan Maru No. 2, a former whale factory which Lt. Comdr. Clarey, as executive officer of , had helped to sink in Kavieng Harbor, Bismarck Archipelago, 10 October 1942. Since then the Japanese had raised the ship and towed her to Japan where she was repaired and converted to a tanker. Two spreads of torpedoes from the submarine left the monster ablaze and sinking and damaged two other tankers. Tonan Maru (19,262 tons) was one of the largest merchant ships sunk by an American submarine during World War II. Following lifeguard station duty off Japan, Pintado turned eastward 1 September and arrived Pearl Harbor on 14 September.  Third patrol, October 1944 – January 1945  On Pintado's third war patrol, Lt. Comdr. Clarey commanded a wolfpack which included and . The group departed Pearl Harbor 9 October heading for the South China Sea. Meanwhile, General Douglas MacArthur was preparing to return to the Philippines. When his troops landed on Leyte 20 October, the Japanese Navy struck back with all its force in a \\"go for broke\\" attempt to smash the invasion. The result was the Battle for Leyte Gulf. As the Americans turned back the Japanese offensive, Clarey's submarines sped toward Luzon Strait to attack the Northern Japanese Force which Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet had engaged off Cape Engaño. On the night of 25 October, Jallao made radar contact with bomb-damaged light cruiser fleeing from Halsey. Pintado closed the scene with Jallao but held her fire while her sister submarine attacked, ready to join in if needed. Jallao launched seven torpedoes, and Tama broke up and went to the bottom, the last cruiser to go down in the Battle off Cape Engaño. A bonus came on 3 November when Pintado's periscope revealed \\"the largest enemy ship we have ever seen\\", apparently an oiler in the support group for the Japanese carriers. Clarey fired six bow torpedoes at the huge target, but enemy destroyer deliberately crossed their path to intercept the torpedoes before they could reach their target. The destroyer disintegrated in a tremendous explosion which provided an effective smoke screen protecting the original target until the two remaining Japanese escorts forced the submarine to dive and withdraw to escape exploding depth charges. Pintado joined on 14 November and escorted the damaged submarine to Saipan, arriving Tanapag Harbor five days later. After a week in port, she resumed her war patrol south of Takao. On the night of 12 December – 13 December, she sank two enemy landing craft, Transport No. 12 and Transport No. 104, and claimed she had sunk a third, Transport No. 106, but apparently missed.Transport No. 106 continued on towards Manila and was sunk on 15 December 1944 by planes from TF 38 (See: ) Two days later she headed for Australia and arrived Brisbane on New Year's Day 1945. She won the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary skill and heroism on her first three war patrols.  Fourth–sixth patrols, January – August 1945  The veteran submarine departed Brisbane 27 January but found no targets as she patrolled the Singapore-Saigon shipping lanes. Throughout the patrol, she played hide and go seek with Japanese aircraft and, on 20 February, barely escaped when a plane appeared from the clouds and dropped two depth charges which jarred the submarine. She made temporary repairs and continued to patrol until returning to Fremantle 30 March. Pintado sailed to Pearl Harbor before getting underway 1 June for her fifth war patrol on lifeguard station for bomber raids on Tokyo. On 26 June, just south of Honshū, a smoking B-29 bomber, the City of Galveston, crossed her bow at about , dropped a dozen parachutes, crashed into the sea and exploded. In less than an hour the submarine had rescued the entire crew which she took to Guam, arriving Apra Harbor a fortnight later. Color Footage of that video can be found at Denver's 9 news The submarine departed Guam 7 August for her sixth and last war patrol, and took station off Tokyo Bay until hearing that hostilities had ended on 15 August. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 August and reached San Francisco 5 September. She remained there until decommissioning 6 March 1946. =Postwar= While in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Pintado was reclassified AGSS-387 on 1 December 1962. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 March 1967 and sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc., Portland, Oregon, 20 January 1969. During the war, Pintado was credited with sinking 13 ships of 98,600 tons, and damaging two additional vessels, one a 28,000 ton aircraft carrier to score a total of 34,300 tons. Postwar, this was reduced to eight ships for 42,963 tons by JANAC.Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), pp.950, 953, & 960. Her conning tower is on display at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas.

It is located about east of Madagascar. Piton des Neiges is the highest point on Réunion and is considered to be the highest point in the Indian Ocean. The volcano was formed by the Réunion hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago. Now deeply eroded, the volcano has been inactive for 20,000 years and is surrounded by three massive crater valleys, the Cirques. Piton des Neiges forms the northwestern two thirds of Réunion, with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest. As it name suggests, snow is occasionally seen on its summit in winter. The volcanic island is considered to be about three million years old (Pliocene); the other two islands in the archipelago, Mauritius and Rodrigues, are 7.8 million (Miocene) and 1 million (Pleistocene) years old, respectively. The island possesses a high endemism of flowering plants (about 225); this has justified the creation of a biological reserve on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges. A panoramic view near to the Gîte de la Caverne Dufour. Tourism The island of Reunion with the three central Cirques, with the ridge summit of the Piton des Neiges in the northwest centre (lighter brown area). The white spot on the crater edge to the southeast of the summit is the alpine hut. There are three medium-difficulty tracks leading up to the peak, one from the Cirque de Salazie, one from the Cirque de Cilaos and one from La Plaine des Cafres. They meet at a staffed mountain hut about an hour's walk below the peak at la Caverne Dufour. Walkers often arrive there after a long day trek up the mountain, and start out very early the next day to watch the sunrise from the summit. The hike can be done in a long one-day 10- to 12-hour hike, but it is often preferable to make it a two-day hike - many hikers like to get up early on the second day and make the (easy) remaining ascent with torches, so as to see the sunrise from the mountaintop. The mountain hut offers heated indoor lodging, outdoor tent lodging, and meals. It is best to make reservations. The hike starting from Cilaos is about 6.5 hours up and 4 hours down. To reach the start of the hike, drive through Cilaos toward la Mare à St Joseph. About 3 km (1.9 mi) past Cilaos, you will see a sign and some parking on both sides of the street. You may also leave your car downtown and follow the road to the trail head (sometimes there is no parking at the trail head). The hike is very steep (a climb of 1700m or 5,577 ft from trail head, almost 2000m or 6,562 ft from downtown), and one should be cautious if the trail is wet. The trail is well marked. The hike starting from la Plaine des Cafres is about 8 hours up and 5 hours down with a change in elevation of 1700m (5,577 ft). To access the hike, follow RN3 past Le Tampon, all the way to La Plaine des Cafres and Bourg Murat. 2.5 km (1.6 mi) after Bourg Murat, take a left on the GR R2 road toward Savane Mare à Boue, follow for 2 km (1.2 mi) and park at the trail head. The trail is well marked. Sunrise from the top of Piton des Neiges.

All such manifolds are prime, orientable, and closed. Spherical 3-manifolds are sometimes called elliptic 3-manifolds or Clifford-Klein manifolds. Properties A spherical 3-manifold S^3/Gamma has a finite fundamental group isomorphic to Γ itself. The elliptization conjecture, proved by Grigori Perelman, states that conversely all compact 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group are spherical manifolds. The fundamental group is either cyclic, or is a central extension of a dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral group by a cyclic group of even order. This divides the set of such manifolds into 5 classes, described in the following sections. The spherical manifolds are exactly the manifolds with spherical geometry, one of the 8 geometries of Thurston's geometrization conjecture. Cyclic case (lens spaces) The manifolds S^3/Gamma with Γ cyclic are precisely the 3-dimensional lens spaces. A lens space is not determined by its fundamental group (there are non-homeomorphic lens spaces with isomorphic fundamental groups); but any other spherical manifold is. Three-dimensional lens spaces arise as quotients of S^3 subset mathbb{C}^2 by the action of the group that is generated by elements of the form : begin{pmatrix}omega &00&omega^qend{pmatrix}. where omega=e^{2pi i/p}. Such a lens space L(p;q) has fundamental group mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} for all q, so spaces with different p are not homotopy equivalent. Moreover, classifications up to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence are known, as follows. The three-dimensional spaces L(p;q_1) and L(p;q_2) are: #homotopy equivalent if and only if q_1 q_2 equiv pm n^2 pmod{p} for some n in mathbb{N}; #homeomorphic if and only if q_1 equiv pm q_2^{pm1} pmod{p}. In particular, the lens spaces L(7,1) and L(7,2) give examples of two 3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. The lens space L(1,0) is the 3-sphere, and the lens space L(2,1) is 3 dimensional real projective space. Lens spaces can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in many ways, usually as fiber spaces over the 2-sphere with at most two exceptional fibers, though the lens space with fundamental group of order 4 also has a representation as a Seifert fiber space over the projective plane with no exceptional fibers. Dihedral case (prism manifolds) A prism manifold is a closed 3-dimensional manifold M whose fundamental group is a central extension of a dihedral group. The fundamental group π1(M) of M is a product of a cyclic group of order m with a group having presentation :langle x,ymid xyx^{-1}=y^{-1}, x^{2^k}=y^nrangle for integers k, m, n with k ≥ 1, m ≥ 1, n ≥ 2 and m coprime to 2n. Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation :langle x,y mid xyx^{-1}=y^{-1}, x^{2m}=y^nrangle for coprime integers m, n with m ≥ 1, n ≥ 2. (The n here equals the previous n, and the m here is 2k-1 times the previous m.) We continue with the latter presentation. This group is a metacyclic group of order 4mn with abelianization of order 4m (so m and n are both determined by this group). The element y generates a cyclic normal subgroup of order 2n, and the element x has order 4m. The center is cyclic of order 2m and is generated by x2, and the quotient by the center is the dihedral group of order 2n. When m = 1 this group is a binary dihedral or dicyclic group. The simplest example is m = 1, n = 2, when π1(M) is the quaternion group of order 8. Prism manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups: if a closed 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a prism manifold M, it is homeomorphic to M. Prism manifolds can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in two ways. Tetrahedral case The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m with a group having presentation :langle x,y,z mid (xy)^2=x^2=y^2, zxz^{-1}=y,zyz^{-1}=xy, z^{3^k}=1rangle for integers k, m with k ≥ 1, m ≥ 1 and m coprime to 6. Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation :langle x,y,z mid (xy)^2=x^2=y^2, zxz^{-1}=y,zyz^{-1}=xy, z^{3m}=1rangle for an odd integer m ≥ 1. (The m here is 3k-1 times the previous m.) We continue with the latter presentation. This group has order 24m. The elements x and y generate a normal subgroup isomorphic to the quaternion group of order 8. The center is cyclic of order 2m. It is generated by the elements z3 and x2 = y2, and the quotient by the center is the tetrahedral group, equivalently, the alternating group A4. When m = 1 this group is the binary tetrahedral group. These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces: the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 3. Octahedral case The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m coprime to 6 with the binary octahedral group (of order 48) which has the presentation :langle x,y mid (xy)^2=x^3=y^4rangle. These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces: the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 4. Icosahedral case The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m coprime to 30 with the binary icosahedral group (order 120) which has the presentation :langle x,y mid (xy)^2=x^3=y^5rangle. When m is 1, the manifold is the Poincaré homology sphere. These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces: the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 5.

She is known for her professional and personal relationship with choreographer Michael Bennett, with whom she collaborated on her most noted role, the character of Cassie in the musical A Chorus Line. She earned the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for this performance in 1976. She is also known for playing Amanda Harris/Olivia Corey on the Gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows from 1969 to 1970.  Early life  McKechnie was born in 1942 in Pontiac, Michigan, the daughter of Donald Bruce McKechnie and Carolyn Ruth Johnson. She began ballet classes at age five. Her earliest influence was the classic British ballet film The Red Shoes (1948), which prompted her, at age eight, to plan a career as a ballerina. She studied for many years at the Rose Marie Floyd School of Dance in Royal Oak. Despite her parents' strong misgivings, she moved to New York City when she was 17. Rejected after an audition for the American Ballet Theatre, she found employment in the corps de ballet at Radio City Music Hall but walked off the job on the day of dress rehearsal to do summer stock at the Carousel Theatre in Framingham, Massachusetts. She studied theatre at HB StudioHB Studio Alumni in New York City. After doing a Welch's Grape Juice commercial and the first L'eggs stockings commercial, she was cast in a touring company of West Side Story. In 1961, she made her Broadway debut in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, where she met choreographer Bob Fosse and his wife, Gwen Verdon. A stint in a Philadelphia production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (as Philia) was followed by the NBC music series Hullabaloo, on which she was a featured dancer. While working on Hullabaloo, she met Michael Bennett, who became her husband and a guiding force in her life and career. She also appeared as Philia in the national tour of Forum, starring Jerry Lester (Pseudolus), with Paul Hartman (Senex), Erik Rhodes (Marcus Lycus), Arnold Stang (Hysterium) and Edward Everett Horton (Erronius), produced by Martin Tahse. Broadway In April, 1968, McKechnie was back on Broadway in the short-lived musical version of Leo Rosten's collection of short stories The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N, which led to a featured role in Burt Bacharach and Hal David's Promises, Promises, choreographed by Bennett. Along with Baayork Lee and Margo Sappington, she danced in one of Broadway's most famous numbers, \\"Turkey Lurkey Time\\", which was when she first began to attract notice from critics and theatergoers alike. This was followed by a role in the touring company of Call Me Madam, starring Ethel Merman. Bennett showcased McKechnie again in Stephen Sondheim's Company (1970), where she danced \\"Tick-Tock\\". After leaving the Broadway cast, she reprised her role in the Los Angeles and London companies, and also toured in the 1971 revival of On the Town as Ivy. In March 1973, she choreographed and performed in the highly acclaimed one-night-only concert Sondheim: A Musical Tribute at the Shubert Theatre in New York. In 1974, she co-starred with Richard Kiley and Bob Fosse in the unsuccessful musical film version of the classic The Little Prince. McKechnie was part of Bennett's group therapy-style workshops that evolved into the Broadway smash A Chorus Line, in which she portrayed Cassie, a character based in large part on herself. She danced her third famous Bennett-McKechnie number, \\"The Music and the Mirror\\", in which the vocal sections were tailored to her unusually wide range. Initially, Donna was to perform the number with four of her male co-stars; however, four previews before opening, McKechnie voiced concern about dancing around the four men, and at the last moment, Bennett changed the direction to have McKechnie perform the song-dance number alone. Her performance earned her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The role of Maggie was also based on her life. She married Bennett in 1976, but after only a few months they separated and eventually divorced, although they remained good friends until his death from AIDS in 1987. In 1980, McKechnie was diagnosed with arthritis and told she never would dance again. She went on to choreograph NFL's Football's Fabulous Females, The Los Angeles Raiderettes in 1983 as they made their debut in L.A. The same year, in season 2 of the TV show Family Ties, she played Cynthia, a divorcee who planned to move west with her young son away from his father. McKechnie pursued various physical, psychological, and holistic healing remedies, and was well enough to return to the Broadway company of A Chorus Line in 1986. Later in the 1980s, she toured in Sweet Charity and Annie Get Your Gun, and she appeared in a London revival of Can-Can. She also participated in the Chorus Line extravaganza to celebrate its then record- breaking run on Broadway in September 1983. Later career Her television work included a regular role on the Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows early in her career. After her rise to fame, she made guest appearances on Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Rowan & Martin's Laugh In, and Cheers (as Deborah, the ex-wife of Sam Malone). She played Suzi Laird on several episodes of Fame. In the early 1990s, McKechnie appeared off-Broadway twice, first in a revue entitled Cut the Ribbons, followed by Annie Warbucks, a less successful sequel to the hit Annie. In 1993, she reunited with most of the original cast of Company for three concert performances. In 1996, she was awarded the Fred Astaire Award for Best Female Dancer for her performance in a Broadway adaptation of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's film State Fair. In the same year, she was in a production of You Never Know at the Pasadena Playhouse. In February, 1997, she played Phyllis in a concert performance of Follies at London's Drury Lane Theatre, and the following year took on the role of Sally in a production of that same show at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. McKechnie also starred opposite Carol Lawrence in the Los Angeles and New York production of Joni Fritz's Girl's Room, produced by Dennis Grimaldi and directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, both former Michael Bennett dancers. In 2001, McKechnie created of the role of Lela Rogers, mother of Ginger Rogers, in the world premiere of Ginger: The Musical. In 2002, McKechnie starred in the pre-Broadway production of the Jerry Herman musical revue Showtune. In recent years, she has toured periodically in her one-woman show Inside the Music, a potpourri of songs, dances and anecdotes about her life in the theater and her successful battle with arthritis, directed by her old Chorus Line castmate, Thommie Walsh. Her autobiography, Time Steps: My Musical Comedy Life, written with Greg Lawrence, was published by Simon & Schuster on August 29, 2006, only weeks before the Broadway revival of A Chorus Line opened on October 5. In June 2010, McKechnie appeared at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival. McKechnie was on the faculty of HB Studio in New York City. In 2015, she served as the standby for Chita Rivera in Kander and Ebb's musical The Visit on Broadway. In the fall of 2017, McKechnie appeared as Mabel in The Pajama Game produced by Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.

The declared objective of Agenda 2010 was to promote economic growth and thus reduce unemployment. The Agenda On 14 March 2003, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder gave a speech before the German Bundestag outlining the proposed plans for reform. He pointed out three main areas which the agenda would focus on: the economy, the system of social security, and Germany's position on the world market. German finance minister Hans Eichel had the responsibility of implementing socially unpopular measures including tax cuts (such as a 25% reduction in the basic rate of income tax), cuts in the cost absorption for medical treatment and drastic cuts in pension benefits, and cuts in unemployment benefits. The measures were ostensibly proposed in accordance with the market liberalisation approach adopted by the EU's Lisbon Strategy. The name Agenda 2010 itself is a reference to the Lisbon Strategy's 2010 deadline. The plan was strongly promoted by the Bertelsmann media group.\\"Ohne Bertelsmann geht nichts mehr\\" (\\"Without Bertelsmann nothing works\\"), Heise online, 9 November 2004 In their book on the Bertelsmann AG and Bertelsmann Foundation, authors Hersch Fischler and Frank Böckelmann assert that \\"The Foundation succeeded through the promotion of Agenda 2010 to make their mark significantly. It is not widely unknown that the Foundation has decisively determined the academic, health, economic, and labor market policy since the start of the Schröder government.\\" Böckelmann, Frank & Hersch Fischler, Bertelsmann: Hinter der Fassade des Medienimperiums (Bertelsmann: Behind the facade of the media empire); Eichborn, Germany; September 2004, A series of changes in the labour market known as the Hartz plan started in 2003 and the last step, Hartz IV, came into effect on 1 January 2005. These changes affected unemployment benefits and job centers in Germany, and the very nature of the German system of social security. Reaction Politicians, industrial leaders, trade unions, media and population consider the Agenda 2010, especially the Hartz IV law, as the largest cut into the German system of social security since World War II. While industrial leaders and both the conservative and economically liberal parliamentary parties such as the CDU, the CSU, and the FDP strongly supported Agenda 2010 as it implemented their long-time demands, there was a strong upheaval in Schröder's own social democratic party. After Schröder threatened to resign (with no obvious successor as Chancellor) if the changes were blocked within his party, since they were so vital to his government's policy, he received an inner-party 80% vote of confidence as well as a 90% approval from his coalition partner, the Greens. The leaders of the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in Germany took the \\"highly unusual step\\" of publicly expressing their support for the government's proposals. \\"The old methods no longer work\\", the chairman of the Evangelical church, Manfred Kock, said. The leader of the country's Catholics, Cardinal Karl Lehman, called Schröder's proposals \\"absolutely necessary\\".\\"Schroeder faces day of reckoning\\" by John Hooper, The Guardian, 30 May 2003 Schröder had won the 2002 federal election with, among other things, the promise not to cut into the social security system. In reaction to the Agenda's policies and the measures taken, a significant number of members of Schröder's SPD left the party, but the more prominent left-wing politicians stayed on. Although the changes eventually went through, Gerhard Schröder, after adverse opinion polls, resigned as party chairman (though not as Chancellor) in February 2004, to give way to Franz Müntefering. This development left the PDS (with only 2 out of the 603 members of the federal parliament) as the only outspoken opponent to the Agenda 2010 policies although their course was somewhat inconsistent. In the Länder of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern and Berlin, where there are SPD-PDS-coalitions (and later SPD-Die Linke coalitions), PDS/Die Linke ministers actively implemented Agenda 2010 laws. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB), the most influential group outside parliament and historically interwoven with the SPD, massively stepped up their discourse against Agenda 2010, especially prior to the Hartz IV law in July 2004, but the rumble subsided quickly after a summit meeting with Schröder in August 2004. The trade unions suffered from a lot of attrition in that process as their members defected in droves either because the unions' attitude was perceived as too lenient or as too strongly opposed. There were no strikes against Agenda 2010 as the German constitution prohibits politically motivated strikes, but some demonstrations at least were organized and supported by the unions. In December 2003, the Bundesrat, dominated by the opposition CDU party, blocked some of the reforms on political grounds until several compromises were reached, many of which put a particularly painful twist—for those affected, for example the unemployed or the ill—on the measures taken. Dissatisfaction with Agenda 2010, and in particular with Hartz IV, lead to thousands of people protesting in the streets of Berlin, Leipzig and other big cities particularly in eastern, but also western Germany over the summer of 2004 (see Monday demonstrations, 2004). Dissent with the Agenda 2010 had also promoted the foundation of a new political party, the Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice (WASG) by long-term SPD members and union activists. The WASG was squarely against the measures taken in the Agenda 2010 process and ran in the 2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, where it gained 2.2% of the votes and no seat, against what it considered \\"the neoliberal consensus\\" displayed by the governing centre-left political parties and the more conservative opposition alike. For the 2005 German federal election the WASG formed a successful electoral alliance with The Left Party.PDS, which reached 8.7% of the votes. In June 2007 both parties merged to a new party, The Left. Consequences The immediate aftermath of the Agenda 2010 reforms was that unemployment rose to over 5.2 million people in February 2005\\"German jobless rate at new record\\" BBC News, 1 March 2005 and Schröder called German companies \\"lazy\\" for failing to hire more workers.N-TV.DE Beginning in 2005, however, unemployment figures began falling and, in May 2007, unemployment was at 3.8 million people, a 5½ year low. The apparent success of Agenda 2010 in reducing unemployment in Germany has been cited in the debate over extending long-term unemployment insurance benefits in the United States. A debate about the socioeconomic results of the Agenda 2010 reforms was stirred by the release of a study conducted by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in late 2006. The study classified 4 percent of people living in West Germany as well as 20 percent of people living in East Germany as living in \\"precarious\\" socio-economic conditions. Although the topic of social conditions in Germany was much debated as a result of this study, with many people (including those in Schröder's own party) laying blame on Schröder and his Hartz IV reforms for the growing economic inequality in Germany, no policy changes have been enacted as a direct result of the study.N-TV.DE By 2008, the wage share of national income had reached a 50-year low of 64.5%.Global Wage Report 2012/13, chapter 5, of the International Labour Organization. Another sign that economic inequality has risen in Germany can be seen in the fact that the number of Germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11% in 2001,Population below poverty line, CIA Factbook to 12.3% in 2004, and about 14% in 2007. According to 2007 government statistics, one out of every six children was poor, a post-1960-record, with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen. Voters seemed to respond to the Agenda 2010 and Hartz IV reforms negatively. In the 2004 elections to the EU parliament, the SPD reached an all-time postwar national election low of only 21% of the votes. The SPD lost by a wide margin in the 2005 regional election in its North-Rhine Westphalia \\"heartland\\", where the regional SPD government was replaced by a CDU-FDP coalition, giving the winners a working majority in the Bundesrat, the federal legislature's upper house. The Social Democrats losses were widely attributed to voters' discontent with the Agenda 2010 reforms. Subsequently, Chancellor Schröder triggered a loss in a confidence vote, which, in turn, necessitated an early general election. In the autumn of 2005, one year ahead of schedule, general elections were held and the Social Democrats were defeated. By 2011, unemployment had fallen from its 10% average of the mid-decade to around 7%, its lowest since the early 1990s. Some scientists see the wage depression in Germany fostered by the Agenda 2010 as one of the causes of the European debt crisis.Nicholas Crafts, Peter Fearon, The Great Depression of the 1930s: Lessons for Today, Oxford University Press, 2013, , p. 445Steffen Lehndorff, A triumph of failed ideas: European models of capitalism in the crisis, ETUI, 2012, , p. 79 ff See also * Demographics of Germany * Politics of Germany References Further reading * External links * A Quick Guide To ‘Agenda 2010’ – Deutsche Welle's English report on the Agenda 2010, 17 Oct 2003 Welfare in Germany 2010 in Germany Political history of Germany Economic policy in Europe Labor in Germany Reform in Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier ","title":"Agenda 2010"},{"id":"1205997","text":"Stephen Anthony \\"Steve\\" Bucknor, OJ (born 31 May 1946) is a former international cricket umpire and coach.

Cricket umpire  Bucknor's first international cricket fixture was a One Day International (ODI) between the West Indies and India at Antigua on 18 March 1989. His first Test match was at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, between 28 April and 3 May 1989, with the competing teams again being the West Indies and India. After umpiring in a few international matches, he was selected to umpire at the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia, and went on to stand in the final despite being quite inexperienced.Steve Bucknor and Brian Aldridge for the 3rd & 2nd time respectively in Cricket World Cup Final ESPN cricinfo Bucknor also stood in the next four World Cup finals in 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007, with the 2007 World Cup taking place in his native West Indies. In 1994 the ICC introduced a policy whereby one of the umpires in each Test match would be independent of the competing nations, selected from the International Panel of Umpires. Bucknor was a member of this panel from its foundation until the ICC changed its policy on umpires again in 2002. Since then both umpires in Test matches, and one of the umpires in ODIs have been independent of the competing countries. The officials are now chosen from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, whom the ICC consider to be the world's best umpires. Bucknor maintained a place on the Elite Panel from its foundation until his retirement. In May 2006, he accused TV companies of doctoring their images to make umpires look bad and key players look good. He was one of five officials, responsible for the wrong decision in the 2007 World Cup final, resulting in play continuing in poor light. Consequently, all five officials were suspended from the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. Dave Richardson, the general manager of cricket at the ICC, has said Bucknor's umpiring accuracy was at 96% during 2005–06,Cricinfo – ICC respond to Bucknor above the average of 94.8% for the Elite Panel.

Steps advocated for reducing the numbers of immigrants include advocating stronger action to prevent illegal entry and illegal immigration, and reductions in non-immigrant temporary work visas (such as H-1B, L-1 and J-1). Some advocate a tightening of the requirements for legal immigration requirements to reduce total numbers, or move the proportions of legal immigrants away from those on family reunification programs to skills-based criteria. What separates it from others who want immigration reform is that reductionists see immigration- or one of its forms- as being a significant source of social, economic, and environmental problems, and wish to cut current immigration levels. Many immigration reformists support continued legal immigration, only opposing illegal immigration. Some immigration reductionists want legal immigration to be set at a percentage of current levels until fewer adverse effects are created by legal immigration.Tom Tancredo's 2003 Bill As used in this Act, the term \`immigration moratorium' means the period beginning on October 1, 2003, and ending on September 30 of the first fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 during which the President submits a report to Congress, which is approved by a joint resolution of Congress, that the flow of illegal immigration has been reduced to less than 10,000 aliens per year and that any increase in legal immigration resulting from termination of the immigration moratorium would have no adverse impact on the wages and working conditions of United States citizens, the achievement or maintenance of Federal environmental quality standards, or the capacity of public schools, public hospitals, and other public facilities to serve the resident population in those localities where immigrants are likely to settle. The related terminology \\"self-deportation\\" or \\"to self-deport\\" refers to the viewpoint that through social policy illegal immigration to the U.S. can be reduced by causing residents to leave the U.S. on their own, thus creating a reduction. In 2016, Donald Trump ran for president as a Republican. His campaign featured rhetoric and policy proposals that were strongly anti- immigrant. Although his proposals were criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic, his proposals found broad support in the U.S. heartland and the Southern United States. He won the election and enacted multiple anti-immigrant policies as president. History Antecedents to immigration reduction or control exist in ancient history, notably in the Roman Empire, where high living standards were an attractant to poorer tribes at the edge of the Empire. Specifically the immigration from North Africa, the Middle East, Germanic peoples from Northern Europe. and Picts north of Hadrian's Wall in Roman Britain were viewed as unwanted population influxes. =Modern history of the immigration reduction movement= There have been several discernible groups at various times within the United States, which pushed for immigration restrictions, with separate concerns, origins, and aims; thus there are several antecedents for the modern immigration reduction movement. These include the nativist United States American Party, often called the Know Nothing movement of the mid-19th century, which objected to increased Catholic immigration of predominantly Irish and German origin; the Workingman's Party which objected to immigration laborers from China to California during the late-19th century, a sentiment that ultimately led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; the Immigration Restriction League, which objected to greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe during the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and the joint congressional Dillingham Commission, which studied this latter complaint and proposed numerical restrictions. Eventually, following World War I, these studies led to the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924. Organized labor and parts of the political left have also had an ongoing debate over immigration levels into the U.S. going back to the 19th century. The National Labor Union (1866–1874) campaigned for immigration restrictions as well as the eight-hour workday, as did the American Federation of Labor under the leadership of Samuel Gompers. The AFL-CIO did not reverse its position on immigration restrictions until 1999. The early United States Socialist Party was split over the issue, with some Socialist leaders including Jack London and Congressman Victor Berger supporting immigration restrictions; the party as a whole never had consensus and officially opposed only the importation of strikebreakers. A separate issue with some overlap was concern over overpopulation. The leading early influence on that issue was Paul R. Ehrlich, who both founded Zero Population Growth and published The Population Bomb in 1968. The popular book foretold alarming disasters that would inevitably occur in the next decades. Though some of his predictions did not come to pass, many believe his main points are valid, and they succeeded in inspiring a movement. Environmentalists including David R. Brower and David Foreman took the threat seriously.Burke, B. Meredith. \\"Immigration's Dire Effect on the Environment .\\" Seattle Times. June 15, 2000. The Zero Population Growth organization did not involve itself, for the most part, in U.S. immigration policy, and a subset of the overpopulation movement grew which believed that immigration needed to be reduced, arguing that immigration was driving most U.S. population growth. These activists founded organizations separate from ZPG which would specifically address immigration issues. Among the important early organizations was Negative Population Growth, founded in 1972 by Donald Mann.What is NPG? . Negative Population Growth: Who We Are. Accessed January 5, 209. The leading inspiration for the modern movement is John Tanton, a self-described progressive and critic of neoclassical economics. Tanton founded the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) in 1979, the largest and best funded organization in the movement. Three years later, Tanton formed US, Inc. as an incubator and funding source to help form other organizations. According to public tax records, US, Inc, FAIR, and other Tanton organizations have received large donations from the Pioneer Fund and from the foundations controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife. Tanton created US English (an English-only advocacy group), the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), ProEnglish (another English-only advocacy group), and The Social Contract Press. US, Inc and FAIR have provided funding and logistical support to other organizations, including American Immigration Control Foundation (AICF), California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR), Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS), and the recent Protect Arizona Now (PAN) initiative, Proposition 200. FAIR claims that there is a relationship between lax immigration policies and terrorism such as the 9/11 attack, and it asserts there is no connection between itself and eugenics.Dan Stein, Recognizing the Holes in Immigration Policies, June 22, 2004 The movement seemed to be triumphant in 1994 when California voters passed Proposition 187, an initiative that limited benefits to illegal aliens that had been authored and promoted by CCIR. However, one federal judge enjoined implementation of parts of the law as unconstitutional, and Democratic governor Gray Davis refused to pursue an appeal of the lower court decision, abandoning Proposition 187. Residual resentment over the racially divisive campaigns on both sides of the issue made immigration a topic that politicians largely avoided dealing with. A notable exception has been Tom Tancredo, who was elected to Congress from Littleton, Colorado in 1994. Together with Patrick Buchanan and the Tanton network, Tancredo has emerged as the most conspicuous voice advocating immigration reduction in Congress. The immigration reduction movement was partly rejuvenated by The Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population coalition. In 1997 members from a range of immigration reduction and environmental organizations met to rededicate themselves to the effort of population stabilization. Organized by Population- Environment Balance, it included such diverse groups as:Signatories - Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population. Population-Environment Balance. June 2005.

The USS3P membership contained many immigration reductionists of the time. In 1999 it sought cosponsors for a major national conference on immigration. A number of major individuals and minor organizations joined as co-sponsors, but no large national groups joined and it folded in 2000 without holding the intended conference. The Internet offered new opportunities for communication by immigration reductionists, as it has with countless other movements. Peter Brimelow founded his VDARE writers collective in 1999. The year 1999 also saw the founding by Craig Nelson of ProjectUSA in New York City, which used billboards to advertise Census Bureau and other statistics about immigration in a campaign dubbed \\"Billboard Democracy,\\" and publishes an ezine in which the term \\"Minuteman\\" was first used (2002) in connection with civilian border patrols. The NumbersUSA group founded by Roy Beck set up automated system for website visitors to send advocacy faxes to their legislators on immigration topics. Numerous websites, email lists, weblogs, and other resources furthered the effort. The electoral success of Arizona's Proposition 200, PAN, indicates the support for immigration reductionism among voters. The PAN initiative qualified for the ballot following the expenditure by FAIR of hundreds of thousands of dollars for signature gathering, plus comparable sums for campaigning with some additional amounts raised locally. The initiative was adopted by the public by a significant margin and is likely to inspire similar efforts in other states. The success of Proposition 200 in Arizona was followed in April 2005 by the Minuteman Project, in which volunteers came to Arizona to help patrol the border, although this project did not have the support of the United States Border Patrol and generated some controversy. The organizers of the Minuteman Project have announced plans for similar projects in other states including Texas, California, and Michigan. In 2016 billionaire New York City businessman and television personality Donald Trump ran a successful presidential campaign promising to stop illegal immigration; deport all undocumented immigrants living in the country illegally; limit legal immigration; stop Muslims from entering the U.S.; ban travel to the US from what he called \\"terror prone\\" countries such as Iran, Libya, Somalia and Syria; triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; and build a wall along the nation's 3,145 kilometer (1,954 mi) border with Mexico to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. Trump also vowed to cut off all federal funding to sanctuary cities, end birthright citizenship, and immediately terminate President Obama’s two executive amnesties including Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which he said were illegal.https://www.politifact.com/truth-o- meter/promises/trumpometer/subjects/immigration/ Although Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and even some of his fellow Republicans such as Mitt Romney called Trump's anti-immigrant platform racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic, his proposals found broad support in the heartland and the south. As president he has enacted a number of policies aimed at reducing immigration, including banning admission to the United States for residents of multiple, predominantly Muslim countries; separating families of immigrants; reversing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; greatly limiting the number of refugees and asylum seekers allowed into the country; and strengthening the southern border. History references *A letter from Samuel Gompers, 1921 *The Auburn University Plainsmen: It's always a Virginian\\" (profile of Brimelow) *Alliance for Stabilizing America's Population *SPLC The Puppeteer Target immigration levels Immigration reductionists differ on the ideal level of immigration they would like to see into the United States. Some believe the numbers should be set each year at whatever level would, in conjunction with the current fertility rate and emigration from the U.S., maintain zero population growth in the country. The most prominent immigration reductionist in government today is U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo R-CO. Tancredo has authored a bill that calls for limiting annual immigration to between 30,000 and 300,000. The organization, Population-Environment Balance (PEB), has issued a Immigration Moratorium Action Plan calling for a \\"non-piercable\\" cap of 100,000 persons annually, which would be a 95% cut from current levels. Carrying Capacity Network (CCN), another small reductionist group closely related to PEB, shares that goal while repeating that it is not opposed to immigration. There are also some who support a moratorium on immigration. The Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America claims that 43% of Californians polled said that a 3-year moratorium on immigration would be beneficial to the state (compared to 40% who said it would be unbeneficial). The America First Party calls for a ten-year moratorium, with only spouses and children of citizens allowed in. Other advocates for moratoriums include the Reform Party and 2004 Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka . The Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance (now defunct), two groups that both operate out of the same Washington, D.C. address, issue frequent statements that advocating for the numbers recommended by the Jordan Commission, 700,000 annually, is \\"counter-productive\\". In a National Alert the CCN warned that organizations supporting numbers higher than 300,000 undercut the movement, and they specifically criticize the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA. Some groups not connected to the immigration reduction movement nonetheless support a reduction to legal immigration levels of around 500,000 to 600,000. In their 1997 book, Misplaced Blame, Alan Durning and Christopher Crowther of Northwest Environment Watch write that illegal immigration gets too much attention, and identify five main sources of population growth, including lack of access to family planning as well as a misguided legal immigration policy, and subsidies to domestic migration. They readily admit that immigration should be reduced by an unspecified amount, but they also show concern for the rights of existing residents. . The AFL-CIO and some mainstream environmentalist groups used to be on record favoring lower immigration numbers, although most have quietly dropped this position in recent years. Proposed methods of reducing illegal immigration =Border barriers= The United States-Mexico barrier has been partially constructed to reduce the flow of unauthorized migrants into the United States. The Trump wall is a colloquial name for a proposed expansion of the Mexico–United States barrier during the presidency of Donald Trump. =Attrition through enforcement= Pro-enforcement U.S. think tanks such as the Center for Immigration Studies have supported an \\"attrition through enforcement\\" doctrine. The aim here is to, as that organization states, \\"Shrink the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board enforcement of the immigration law. By deterring the settlement of new illegals, by increasing deportations to the extent possible, and, most importantly, by increasing the number of illegals already here who give up and deport themselves, the United States can bring about an annual decrease in the illegal-alien population, rather than allowing it to continually increase.\\" This approach concedes that mass deportations of illegal aliens is logistically, economically, and politically untenable. Arizona SB1070, the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure enacted in the U.S. in generations, explicitly states its intent as implementing the attrition through enforcement strategy. =Intergovernmental cooperation= Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 287(g) provides for the deputization of state and local law enforcement officers, for the purposes of reporting of immigrants who have violated immigration law. Morristown, New Jersey mayor Donald Cresitello (Democrat) has sought to deputize his police as immigration agents. Newark, New Jersey city councilman Ron Rice, Jr. has proposed a resolution mandating police to report felony suspects when they are found to be in the United State illegally.Elizabeth Llorente, \\"Newark killings become immigration flash point,\\" North Jersey Media Group, August 14, 2007 Furthermore, the Attorney General of New Jersey Anne Milgram has expanded officers power regarding illegal immigrants. She told the state police to inform federal authorities when an illegal immigrant is arrested in an indictable crime or for drunk driving. There are an estimated 380,000 people living in New Jersey without proper immigration documents. She said that she wanted local, county and state police to hand more serious cases directly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Tom Baldwin, \\"State AG broadens officers' power over illegal immigrants\\" \\"Gannett New Jersey\\" August 23, 2007 http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/NEWS01/708230422/1006/news01 =Legislative initiatives= Others focus on lobbying to lower future illegal immigration levels through congressional action, and to fight amnesties for existing illegal immigrants. Many immigration restrictionists question the 1898 Supreme Court ruling U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, which held that individuals born on U.S. soil to non-citizen parents are U.S. citizens and guaranteed all the rights thereof. They feel that citizenship should be denied to the children of immigrants without valid immigration status. Thus they have sought to end birthright citizenship, through a constitutional amendment or a congressional act. Denial of public benefits to undocumented individuals is believed to remove the incentives and rewards for illegal immigrants. The 1994 California Proposition 187 and the 2004 Arizona Proposition 200 Protect Arizona Now were written to require proof of legal status in order to receive non-mandated benefits. Differences within immigration reductionism Many who support reduced immigration numbers oppose association with the more extreme groups. The Federation for American Immigration Reform has spoken out in 2004 against the views of another reductionist leader, Virginia Abernethy, calling her views \\"repulsive separatist views,\\" and called on her to resign from the advisory board of Protect Arizona Now in Arizona. PEB and CCN are also critical of FAIR for FAIR's support of a national ID card, which PEB and CCN oppose. The Protect Arizona Now movement split, with two rival state-level organizations, one supported by FAIR, the other supported by PEB and CCN, working to support the passage of the ballot initiative. Public opinion on immigration reduction Some polls such as a late 2013 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute have found widespread opposition to immigration reduction. Said survey stated that 63% of Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship so that formerly illegal residents of the U.S. could gradually acquire it while only 18% back a hypothetical plan to find and deport all illegal residents.

Little Rock AFB is the primary C-130 Hercules training base for the Department of Defense, training C-130 pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and loadmasters from all branches of the US military in tactical airlift and aerial delivery. It is home to C-130H and C-130J aircraft, as well as the C-130 Center of Excellence (i.e., schools for C-130H and C-130J crews). The host unit at Little Rock AFB is the 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW), assigned to the Air Mobility Command 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force. The wing provides the Department of Defense the largest C-130 Hercules transport fleet in the world, supplying humanitarian airlift relief to victims of disasters, as well as airdropping supplies and troops into the heart of contingency operations in hostile areas. Other organizations at Little Rock AFB include the 189th Airlift Wing of the Arkansas Air National Guard, and the C-130 division of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School. All of these organizations fly the C-130 Hercules. Little Rock Air Force Base is the fourth largest employer in the state of Arkansas, with a local economic impact of $813.6 million.http://www.littlerock.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-140825-056.pdf  History  leftLittle Rock Air Force Base was authorized in 1953 and construction began on 6 November 1953. The base opened on 24 January 1955 with 6,100 acres donated by landowners, valued at $1.2 million in 1952. Communications and several storage buildings, JATO facility, ordnance igloos, track and loading platform were completed by 30 June 1955, and the base was opened to limited air traffic on 9 September 1955. The base headquarters facility was accepted 31 January 1956, and all runways and other operational concrete areas were completed by January 1957. The base was officially activated by Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 August 1955, hosting SAC's 384th Bombardment Wing (384 BW) flying the Boeing B-47E Stratojet, and the 70th Reconnaissance Wing (70 RW) flying the RB-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratofreighter. In 1960, the Air Force announced that Little Rock Air Force Base would house 18 Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles located throughout the state of Arkansas. In 1961, the 70 RW was redesignated as the 70th Bombardment Wing (Medium) and converted to the B-47, but was inactivated the following year before being declared combat-ready. In September 1962, the 154th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Arkansas Air National Guard relocated to Little Rock AFB and reorganized as the 189th Tactical Reconnaissance Group (189 TRG). In October 1962, the 384th Bomb Wing deployed 11 Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft to civilian municipal airports around the nation for dispersal alert purposes during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also in 1962, SAC established the 308th Strategic Missile Wing (308 SMW) as the host organization for Little Rock AFB's Titan II missile operations, with the first of the Titan II missiles installed at a site in Searcy, Arkansas in February 1963. leftIn September 1964, the 384th Bomb Wing inactivated following the retirement of the B-47 from front-line service in SAC. That same year, SAC's 43d Bombardment Wing transferred from Carswell AFB, Texas with its B-58 Hustler supersonic aircraft. The 43d Bomb Wing would continue to operate at Little Rock until the B-58s were withdrawn from operational service in January 1970. In June 1965, Little Rock's 189 TRG became the first Air National Guard unit to operate the RF-101 Voodoo and by December, had assumed the RF-101 Replacement Training Unit (RTU) mission for the entire Air Force. The same year, the base and associated flying units also participated in various relief efforts such as a tornado that ripped through Conway, Arkansas in April and Hurricane Betsy in Louisiana in September. In the 1970s the base went through significant changes, with the first C-130 Hercules aircraft arriving in March 1970. On 31 March 1970, Little Rock Air Force Base officially transferred from SAC to Tactical Air Command (TAC), with TAC's 314th Tactical Airlift Wing (314 TAW) taking over host wing responsibilities. Although SAC's 308 SMW and its Titan II ICBMs continued to be a major tenant, the base's primary mission became C-130 tactical airlift operations and training, with two operational C-130 squadrons assigned and two C-130 training squadrons assigned. In 1974, following the divestiture of C-130 tactical airlift aircraft from TAC, both the 314 TAW and Little Rock AFB transferred from TAC control to that of the Military Airlift Command (MAC). On 1 January 1976, the 189 TRG transferred being a TAC-gained unit to a SAC-gained unit when it converted to the KC-135 Stratotanker and was redesignated the 189th Air Refueling Group (189 ARG), becoming one of the first Air National Guard units to be assigned to Strategic Air Command with a concomitant requirement to maintain a 24-hour alert force at Little Rock as well as deployments to support worldwide tanker task forces. =Damascus incident= On 18 September 1980, an airman conducting maintenance on a USAF Titan II missile at Little Rock Air Force Base's Launch Complex 374-7 in Southside (Van Buren County), just north of Damascus, Arkansas, dropped a socket which fell impacting the rocket's first stage fuel tank resulting in a leak. In response, evacuations were made in the area. The leaking fuel exploded on 19 September. The force of the blast resulted in the W53 nuclear warhead being hurled about from the launch complex's entry gate; its safety features operated correctly and prevented any loss of radioactive material. An Air Force airman was killed and the launch complex was destroyed. =Recent years= On 1 October 1986, the 189 ARG saw yet another mission change when it was redesignated as the 189th Tactical Airlift Group (189 TAG) and converted to the C-130 aircraft, with transfer of operational claimancy to MAC. leftDuring the 1991 Gulf War, the 314 TAW's two operational C-130 squadrons and the 189 TAG's C-130 squadron supported operations from both the middle east and European theaters. Later that year, the 314th Tactical Airlift Wing was redesignated as the 314th Airlift Wing (314 AW), and following the disestablishment of MAC in 1992, the base and the 314 AW were transferred to the new Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 189 TAG was also redesignated as the 189th Airlift Group (189 AG) the same year, followed by redesignation as the 189th Airlift Wing (189 AW) in 1995. In 1993, the base and the 314 AW transferred to Air Combat Command (ACC), as part the U.S. Air Force's decision to transfer continental U.S.-based C-130s from AMC to ACC. In 1997, the U.S. Air Force reversed this decision, returning most C-130 airlift back to AMC claimancy. However, given the 314 AW's primary training mission as the Formal Training Unit (FTU) for C-130s, the base and the 314 AW were transferred to the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and the base's two operational Regular Air Force C-130 squadrons were organized under the 463d Airlift Group, an AMC unit. From the mid-1990s to the late 1990s, the 314 AW and the 463 AG supported the air war over Serbia and since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 463 AG has supported both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom until the 463 AG was inactivated on 1 October 2008.Little Rock AFB, February 2010 In its 50-year history, Little Rock Air Force Base has been operated by six Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs): SAC, TAC, MAC, AMC, ACC, and AETC. These represent every possible MAJCOM a continental U.S.-based operational flying base could have been assigned to except for the former Air Defense Command/Aerospace Defense Command (ADC), Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), and the current Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). In 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama visited the Little Rock base to mark the second anniversary of the Let's Move initiative. =Major commands to which assigned= *Strategic Air Command, 1 February 1955 *Tactical Air Command, 1 April 1970 *Military Airlift Command, 1 December 1974 *Air Mobility Command, 1 June 1992 – 1 July 1993; 1 April 1997 – present : Attached to: Air Education and Training Command, 1 April 1997 – present *Air Combat Command, 1 July 1993 – 1 April 1997 =Major units assigned= * 70th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 24 January 1955 – 25 October 1961 : Redesignated: 70th Bombardment Wing, 25 October 1961 – 25 June 1962 * 384th Bombardment Wing, 1 August 1955 – 1 September 1965 * 825th Air Division, 1 August 1955 – 1 June 1962 : Redesignated: 825 Strategic Aerospace Division, 1 June 1962 – 1 April 1970 * 308th Strategic Missile Wing, 1 April 1962 – 18 August 1987 * 189th Tactical Reconnaissance Group (various designations), 1 October 1962 – present * 43d Bombardment Wing, 1 September 1964 – 31 January 1970 * 64th Tactical Airlift Wing, 9 March 1970 – 30 May 1971 * 314th Tactical Airlift Wing, 1 April 1971 – 1974 : Redesignated: 314th Military Airlift Wing, 1974 – 1991 : Redesignated: 314th Airlift Wing, 1991 – present * 834th Airlift Division, 1 January 1972 – 31 December 1974 * 34th Tactical Airlift Training Group, 15 September 1978 – 1 December 1991 * 463d Airlift Group, 1 April 1997 – 1 October 2008 * United States Air Force Mobility Weapons School, 3 February 2003 – present * 19th Airlift Wing, 1 October 2008 – present Mueller, Robert (1989).

This includes material starting from the 5th century AD, when Welsh was in the process of becoming distinct from Common Brittonic, and continuing to the works of the 16th century. The Welsh language became distinct from other dialects of Old British sometime between AD 400 and 700; the earliest surviving literature in Welsh is poetry dating from this period. The poetic tradition represented in the work of Y Cynfeirdd (\\"The Early Poets\\"), as they are known, then survives for over a thousand years to the work of the Poets of the Nobility in the 16th century. The core tradition was praise poetry; and the poet Taliesin was regarded as the first in the line. The other aspect of the tradition was the professionalism of the poets and their reliance on patronage from kings, princes and nobles for their living. The fall of the Kingdom of Gwynedd and the loss of Welsh independence in any form in 1282 proved a crisis in the tradition, but one that was eventually overcome. It led to the innovation of the development of the cywydd meter, a looser definition of praise, and a reliance on the nobility for patronage. The professionalism of the poetic tradition was sustained by a Guild of Poets, or Order of Bards, with its own \\"rule book\\" emphasising the making of poetry as a craft. Under its rules poets undertook an apprenticeship of nine years to become fully qualified. The rules also set out the payment a poet could expect for his work. These payments varied according to how long a poet had been in training and also the demand for poetry at particular times during the year. Alongside the court poet, kings, princes and nobles patronised an official storyteller (Welsh: cyfarwydd). Like poets, the storytellers were also professionals; but unlike the poets, little of their work has survived. What has survived are literary creations based on native Welsh tales which would have been told by the storytellers. The bulk of this material is found in the collection known today as the Mabinogion. Medieval Welsh prose was not confined to the story tradition but also included a large body of both religious and practical works, in addition to a large amount translated from other languages. Welsh poetry before 1100 In Welsh literature the period before 1100 is known as the period of Y Cynfeirdd (\\"The Early Poets\\") or Yr Hengerdd (\\"The Old Poetry\\"). It roughly dates from the birth of the Welsh language until the arrival of the Normans in Wales towards the end of the 11th century. The oldest Welsh literature does not belong to the territory we know as Wales today, but rather to northern England and southern Scotland (collectively Yr Hen Ogledd), and so could be classified as being composed in Cumbric, a Brythonic dialect closely related to Old Welsh. Though it is dated to the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries it has survived only in 13th- and 14th- century manuscript copies. Some of these early poets' names are known from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, traditionally ascribed to the historian Nennius. The Historia lists the famous poets from the time of King Ida, AD 547–559: :\\"At that time, Talhaiarn Tataguen was famed for poetry, and Neirin, and Taliesin, and Bluchbard, and Cian, who is called Guenith Guaut, were all famous at the same time in British (that is, Brythonic or Welsh) poetry.\\" Of the poets named here it is believed that works that can be identified as Aneirin's and Taliesin's have survived. =Taliesin= The poetry of Taliesin has been preserved in a 14th-century manuscript known as Llyfr Taliesin (Book of Taliesin). This manuscript contains a large body of later mystical poetry attributed to the poet, but scholars have recognised twelve poems that belong to the 6th century. They are all poems of praise: one for Cynan Garwyn, king of Powys about 580; two for Gwallawg, king of Elmet, a kingdom based around the modern Leeds; and nine other poems associated with Urien Rheged, a ruler of the kingdom of Rheged, located around the Solway Firth, and his son, Owain. Taliesin's verses in praise of Urien and Owain became models for later poets, who turned to him for inspiration as they praised their own patrons in terms that he had used for his. =Aneirin= Aneirin, a near-contemporary of Taliesin, wrote a series of poems to create one long poem called Y Gododdin. It records the Battle of Catraeth, fought between the Britons of the kingdom of Gododdin (centred on Eidyn, the modern Edinburgh) and the Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia in the north east of England. This battle was fought at Catterick in about the year 598. It has survived in Llyfr Aneirin (The Book of Aneirin), a manuscript dating from c. 1265. =Llywarch Hen and Heledd= The poetry associated with Llywarch Hen, Canu Llywarch Hen and with Heledd, Canu Heledd, dates from a somewhat later period: the whole of Canu Heledd is generally thought to be from the 9th century; while the earliest parts of Canu Llywarch are probably also 9th century, other parts of the cycle may be as late as the 11th or 12th centuries.Jenny Rowland, Early Welsh Saga Poetry: A Study and Edition of the ‘Englynion’ (Cambridge: Brewer, 1990), pp. 388–89. These poems, in the form of monologues, express the sorrow and affliction felt at the loss of the eastern portion of the Kingdom of Powys (present day Shropshire) to the English, but they are also works where nature is an important element in the background, reflecting the main action and feelings of the poetry itself. =Other early poetry= Though the Anglo-Saxon invaders seem to break Welsh hearts in most of the early poetry, there are some poems of encouragement and the hope of an eventual and decisive defeat that would drive them back into the sea. One such poem is the 10th-century Armes Prydein from the Book of Taliesin which sees a coalition of Irish, British, and Scandinavian forces defeating the English and restoring Britain to the Welsh. This period also produced religious poetry, such as the englynion in praise of the Trinity found in the 9th-century Juvencus Manuscript (Cambridge MS Ff. 4.42), which is now at Cambridge University Library. In the Book of Taliesin we find a 9th-century poem Edmyg Dinbych (In Praise of Tenby, a town in Pembrokeshire), probably produced by a court poet in Dyfed to celebrate the New Year (Welsh: Calan). The book also includes important poems which were probably not composed by Taliesin, including the Armes Prydein (The Great Prophecy of Britain) and Preiddeu Annwfn, (The Spoils of Annwn), and the Book of Aneirin has preserved an early Welsh nursery rhyme, Pais Dinogad (Dinogad's Petticoat). Much of the nature poetry, gnomic poetry, prophetic poetry, and religious poetry in the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Red Book of Hergest is also believed to date from this period. Welsh poetry 1100 – 1600 From c. 1100 to 1600 Welsh poetry can be divided roughly into two distinct periods: the period of the Poets of the Princes who worked before the loss of Welsh independence in 1282, and the Poets of the Nobility who worked from 1282 until the period of the English incorporation of Wales in the 16th century. =Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 – c. 1300)= In Welsh this period is known as Beirdd y Tywysogion (Poets of the Princes) or Y Gogynfeirdd (The Less Early Poets). The main source for the poetry of the 12th and 13th centuries is the Hendregadredd manuscript, an anthology of court poetry brought together at the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey from about 1282 until 1350. The poets of this period were professionals who worked in the various princely courts in Wales. They were members of a Guild of poets whose rights and responsibilities were enshrined in native Welsh law; and as such, they worked within a developed literary culture and with inflexible traditions. Bardic families were still common—the poet Meilyr Brydydd had a poet son and at least two poet grandsons—but it was becoming more and more usual for the craft of poetry to be taught formally, in bardic schools which might only be run by the pencerdd (chief musician). The pencerdd was the top of his profession, and a special chair was set aside for him in the court, in an honoured position next to the heir. When he performed he was expected to sing twice: once in honour of God, and once in honour of the king. The bardd teulu (household poet) was one of the 24 officers of the court and he was responsible for singing for the military retinue before going into battle, and for the queen in the privacy of her chamber. The lowest ranking poets were the cerddorion (musicians). The poetry praises the military prowess of the prince in a language that is deliberately antiquarian and obscure, echoing the earlier praise poetry tradition of Taliesin. There is also some religious poems and poetry in praise of women. With the death of the last native prince of Wales in 1282, the tradition gradually disappears. In fact, Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch's (fl. 1277–83) elegy on the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, is one of the most notable poems of the era. Other prominent poets of this period include: *Meilyr Brydydd, fl. c. 1100–1137; the earliest of the Gogynfeirdd *Bleddyn Fardd, fl. c. 1258–1284; *Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr; fl. c. 1155–1200; *Dafydd Benfras, fl. c. 1220–58; and *Llywarch ap Llywelyn (also known as Prydydd y Moch (English: \\"Pigs' Poet\\")), fl. 1174/5-1220. A rather different poet of this period was Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (d. 1170) who as the son of Prince Owain Gwynedd, was not a professional poet. =Poets of the Nobility, or, Cywyddwyr (c. 1300 – c. 1600)= The poetic tradition thrived in Wales as long as there were patrons available to welcome its practitioners. Until 1282, Wales consisted of a number of 'kingdoms', each with its own independent ruler; this ensured that there was no shortage of courts available to the travelling professional poet or \\"bard\\". After 1282 the poetic tradition survived by turning to the land-owning nobility to act as patrons, and these included some Norman lords who had successfully integrated themselves with the Welsh. Much of the poetry of this period is praise poetry, in praise of the patron and his family, his ancestors, his house and his generosity; and the cywydd is the most popular poetic metre used. Because of the popularity of the cywydd, this period is also known as the period of the Cywyddwyr (poets who wrote using the cywydd metre). The poetry was very often sung to the accompaniment of the harp. Though praise was the main matter of poetry, satire (Welsh: dychan) also thrived. The poets organised themselves into a Guild to protect their professional status, and from time to time their rules were revised and updated. Perhaps the most important such revisions were those concerning patronage and poetic rank made at the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1523. The work of numerous poets of this period survives; some are anonymous, but very many are identified. Here are a few of the most prominent and influential of these: Dafydd ap Gwilym (c. 1315/20 – c. 1350/1370) Wales's greatest poet worked during the period of the Poets of the Nobility. He is known for such poems as \\"The Girls of Llanbadarn\\", \\"Trouble at a Tavern\\", \\"The Wind\\" and \\"The Seagull\\". For more information about his life and work, see Dafydd ap Gwilym. Iolo Goch (c. 1325 – c. 1398) From the Vale of Clwyd, Iolo Goch (English: \\"Red Ed\\") bridged between the periods of the Poets of the Princes and Poets of the Nobility. Early in his career he composed in the former tradition, but he was among the first to sing the praises of the nobles and others using the cywydd. His main patron was Ithel ap Robert from Coedymynydd near Caerwys. Perhaps his most famous work is a cywydd in praise of Owain Glyndŵr's home at Sycharth. Siôn Cent (c. 1400 – 1430/45) Traditionally associated with Breconshire, Siôn Cent is most famous for using his poetry in the service of his Christian beliefs, and standing outside the tradition of praise of patron. He uses the cywydd for his work, to attack the sins of this world. Perhaps his most famous poem is I wagedd ac oferedd y byd (English: \\"In praise of the vanity and dissipation of the world\\"). He turns his back on the praise of nobles, which he sees as flattery and falsehood, and sets his eyes on the blessedness of heaven. Guto'r Glyn (c. 1435 – c. 1493) Guto'r Glyn is associated with Glyn Ceiriog, Denbighshire, where many of his patrons lived. He also wrote poems for other patrons in the four corners of Wales whose houses he visited on his journeys. He was a master of the praise tradition in poetry. Guto was also a soldier who fought on the Yorkist side during the War of the Roses, but spent his last years as a lay guest at the Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis, near Llangollen (a short distance from Glyn Ceiriog). Dafydd Nanmor (fl. 1450 – 1490) Dafydd Nanmor, born at Nanmor (or Nantmor), Gwynedd, is one of the most significant poets of this period. It is said that he was exiled to south Wales for overstepping the mark in his poetry and spent the rest of his life outside Gwynedd. His work was seen to have particular significance by the 20th-century critic Saunders Lewis. Lewis saw him as a poet of philosophy who praised the ideal ruler as he praised his patrons who saw that within the Welsh tradition all who had privilege and power also had responsibilities towards family, community and nation. Tudur Aled (c. 1465 – c. 1525) Tudur Aled was himself a nobleman and one of the greatest of the Poets of the Nobility. Born in Llansannan, Denbighshire, his most important patrons were the Salisbury family of Dyffryn Clwyd. He was one of the instigators of the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1523. In his final illness he took the habit of the Order of St. Francis and died in Carmarthen, where he was buried in the Brothers' Court. At his death the elegies his fellow poets wrote in his memory attested to his greatness as a poet. He was renowned as a praise poet of both secular and religious noblemen, and also reflects the changes at the beginning of the 16th century which were threatening the future of the bardic system. Gruffudd Hiraethog (d.1564) A native of Llangollen, Gruffudd Hiraethog was one of the foremost poets of the 16th century to use the cywydd. Though he was a member of the medieval guild of poets and a notable upholder of that tradition, he was also closely associated with William Salesbury, Wales' leading Renaissance scholar. In fact one of the first Welsh literature to be published in print was Gruffudd's collection of proverbs in 1547, Oll synnwyr pen Kembero ygyd (Modern Welsh spelling: Holl synnwyr pen Cymro i gyd; English:\\"All the wisdom of a Welshman's head (collected) together\\"). =Other voices in poetry 1300 – 1600= Not all of the poetry which survives from this period belongs to the tradition of the praise poetry of the nobility. Some groups of poets and genres of poetry stood completely outside that tradition. Women seem to be totally excluded from the Welsh poetic guild, or Order of bards. But we do know that some women did master the Welsh poetic craft and wrote poetry at this time, but only the work of one woman has survived in significant numbers, that of Gwerful Mechain. The prophetic poetry (Welsh: canu brud) was a means of reacting to and commenting upon political situations and happenings. This poetry is intentionally ambiguous and difficult to understand. But at its heart it prophesies victory for the Welsh over their enemies, the English. This poetry looked towards a man of destiny who would free them from their oppressors. With the victory of the 'Welshman' Henry VII in 1485 at the battle of Bosworth the poets believed that the prophecies had been fulfilled and the tradition comes to an end. Satire poetry (Welsh: canu dychan) was part of the 'official' poets' repertoire and sparingly used within the praise tradition to chastise a miserly patron. But it was in private poetic bouts with fellow poets that the satire tradition flourished. Welsh prose It is believed that the earliest written Welsh is a marginal note of some sixty-four words in Llyfr Teilo (The Book of St. Teilo), a gospel book originating in Llandeilo but now in the library of St. Chad's Cathedral, Lichfield, and also known as the Lichfield Gospels, or, The Book of St. Chad. The marginal note, known from its opening (Latin) word as The Surexit memorandum, dates from the ninth century, or even earlier, and is a record of a legal case over land. The native Welsh storyteller, known as the cyfarwydd (\\"the one who knows\\") was an official of the court. He was expected to know the traditional knowledge and the tales. But the storytelling tradition was basically oral, and only a few remnants suggest the wealth of that tradition. Amongst the most important are Trioedd Ynys Prydain, or the Welsh Triads, a compendium of mnemonics for poets and storytellers. The stories that have survived are literary compositions based on oral tradition. In the Middle Ages Welsh was used for all sorts of purposes and this is reflected in the type of prose materials that has survived from this period: original material and translations, tales and facts, religious and legal, history and medicine. =Native Welsh tales, or, Mabinogion= The name Mabinogion is a convenient label for a collection of tales preserved in two manuscripts known as the White book of Rhydderch and the Red Book of Hergest. They are written in Middle Welsh, the common literary language between the end of the eleventh century and the fourteenth century. They include the four tales that form Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi (\\"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi\\"): *Pwyll prince of Dyfed; *Branwen daughter of Llŷr; *Manawydan son of Llŷr; *Math son of Mathonwy. Two are native tales embodying traditions about King Arthur: *Culhwch and Olwen the earliest Arthurian tale in any language; *The Dream of Rhonabwy. Two more are native tales embodying traditions about the early history of Britain: *Lludd and Llefelys; *The Dream of Maxen. The final three are the Arthurian Welsh Romances, showing the influence of French poet Chrétien de Troyes: *Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain, from Yvain, the Knight of the Lion; *Geraint and Enid, from Erec and Enide; *Peredur son of Efrog, from Perceval, the Story of the Grail. =Native Welsh law= Tradition holds that Hywel Dda summoned a conference at Whitland, Carmarthenshire, in about 945. At this conference Welsh law was codified and set down in writing for posterity. Since the earliest manuscripts containing these legal texts date from about two hundred and fifty years after the event they are probably not a record of what was codified there, if such a conference was even convened. In fact, until the annexation of Wales in 1536, native Welsh law grew and developed organically and for that reason many more copies of it have survived than of the native tales. The use of Welsh for legal texts shows that it had the words and the technical terms with definite and exact meanings needed in such circumstances. It also shows that reading and writing Welsh was not confined to priests and monks, but that there were also lawyers \\"whose skill is directed not to administrating the law (there were judges for that), but to writing it, to giving it permanence in words, to ordering words and sentences in such a way that what was stated should be quite clear\\" (Thomas Parry (1955), p. 68). =Religious texts= The vast majority of Welsh religious texts from the Middle Ages are translations and mostly the works of unknown monks and priests. The works themselves reflect the tastes and fashions of Christendom at the time: apocryphal narratives, dreams or visions, theological treatises and exegesis, and mystical works. Lives of the saints About thirty lives of the saints, both native ones like Beuno, Curig, and Gwenfrewi and the more general such as the Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Martin of Tours, and Catherine of Alexandria survive, all translations into Welsh from Latin. Even the lives of the native saints were composed in Latin originally, and that a long time after the saint's actual life and so of little or no interest to those looking for actual historical information. Perhaps the two most important is Buchedd Dewi (\\"The life of Dewi, or, David\\") written by Rhygyfarch in about 1094, and Buchedd Cadog (Life of Cadog\\") written by Lifris of Llancarfan in c. 1100. =History texts= The Welsh medieval history texts belong to the class of literary creations, but the split into two distinct groups. While the first group, Brut y Tywysogion, tends to stick to historical facts, the second, Brut y Brenhinedd, is the fantastic creation of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Brut y Tywysogion Brut y Tywysogion (Chronicle of the Princes) are variant Welsh translation of a Latin original annales telling the history of Wales from the seventh century to the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282. It is believed that original and its translation were produced at the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey. Brut y Brenhinedd Brut y Brenhinedd (Chronicle of the Kings) is the name given to a number of texts that ultimately trace their origins back to translations of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (1136). As such they were key works in shaping how the Welsh thought of themselves and others, tracing their origins back to Brutus of Troy, the mythical founder of Britain. In fact the Welsh word brut is derived from Brutus's name and originally meant \\"a history of Brutus\\" and then \\"a chronicle history\\". Sources =Welsh poetry before 1100= *General **Jarman, A.

Josephus Flavius identified the Moschoi with the Biblical Meshech. Two different groups are called Muški in Assyrian sources (Diakonoff 1984:115), one from the 12th to the 9th centuries BCE near the confluence of the Arsanias and the Euphrates (\\"Eastern Mushki\\") and the other from the 8th to the 7th centuries BCE in Cappadocia and Cilicia (\\"Western Mushki\\"). Earlier Assyrian sources clearly identify the Western Mushki with the Phrygians, but later Greek sources then distinguish between the Phrygians and the Moschoi. Identification of the Eastern Mushki with the Western Mushki is uncertain, but it is possible that at least some of the Eastern Mushki migrated to Cilicia in the 10th to the 8th centuries BCE. Although almost nothing is known about what language the Eastern or Western Mushki spoke, they have been variously identified as being speakers of a Phrygian, Armenian, Anatolian, or Georgian language. Eastern Mushki The Eastern Mushki appear to have moved into Hatti in the 12th century BC, completing the downfall of the collapsing Hittite state (already largely annexed by Assyria), along with various Sea Peoples. They established themselves in a post-Hittite kingdom in Cappadocia. Whether they moved into the core Hittite areas from the east or west has been a matter of some discussion by historians. Some speculate that they may have originally occupied a territory in the area of Armenia; alternatively, ancient accounts suggest that they first arrived from a homeland in the west (as part of the Phrygian migration), from the region of Troy, or even from as far as Macedonia, as the Bryges. Together with the Urumu and Kaskas (Apishlu), they attempted to invade the Middle Assyrian Empire's Anatolian provinces of Alzi and Puruhuzzi in about 1160 BC, but they were pushed back and subjugated by Ashur-Dan I.Diakonoff, Igor M. The Pre-history of the Armenian People Delmar, New York (1968, translated 1984) ch.3.2.4. In 1115 BC, the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I conquered as far as Milid. It's been speculated that the Mushki were connected to the spread of the so-called Transcaucasian ceramic ware, which appeared as far west as modern Elazig, Turkey in the late second millennium BCE. pp. 260-261 This ceramic ware is believed to have been developed in the South Caucasus region, possibly by the Trialeti-Vanadzor culture originally, which suggests an eastern homeland for the Mushki. pp. 96-97 pp. 220-222 pp. 260-261 Western Mushki In the 8th century BC, Tabal became the most influential of the Neo-Hittite polities, and the Mushki under Mita entered an anti-Assyrian alliance with Tabal and Carchemish. The alliance was soon defeated by Sargon of Assyria, who captured Carchemish and drove back Mita to his own province. Ambaris of Tabal was diplomatically married to an Assyrian princess, and received the province of Hilakku under Assyrian dominion, but in 713 BC, Ambaris was deposed and Tabal became a fully fledged Assyrian province. In 709 BC, the Mushki re-emerged as allies of Assyria, Sargon naming Mita as his friend. It appears that Mita had captured and handed over to the Assyrians emissaries of Urikki, king of Que, who were sent to negotiate an anti-Assyrian contract with Urartu, as they passed through his territory. According to Assyrian military intelligence reports to Sargon recorded on clay tablets found in the Royal Archives of Nineveh by Sir Henry Layard, the Cimmerians invaded Urartu from Mannai in 714 BC. From there they turned west along the coast of the Black Sea as far as Sinope, and then headed south towards Tabal, in 705 BC campaigning against an Assyrian army in central Anatolia, resulting in the death of Sargon II, although they were cleared from Assyrian ruled territory. Macqueen (1986:157) and others have speculated that the Mushki under Mita may have participated in the Assyrian campaign and were forced to flee to western Anatolia, disappearing from Assyrian accounts, but entering the periphery of Greek historiography as king Midas of Phrygia. Rusas II of Urartu in the 7th century BC fought the Mushki-ni to his west, before he entered an alliance with them against Assyria. Mushki and Armenians According to Igor Diakonoff, the Mushki were a Thraco-Phrygian group who carried their Proto-Armenian language from the Balkans across Asia Minor, mixing with Hurrians (and Urartians) and Luwians along the way.https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-iran/iran- armenia-and-georgia/9D67379B2C91E12661E2E294E2C7457F Diakonoff theorized that the root of the name Mushki was \\"Mush\\" (or perhaps \\"Mus,\\" \\"Mos,\\" or \\"Mosh\\") with the addition of the Armenian plural suffix -k'.Igor M. Diakonoff. The Pre-history of the Armenian People. 1968. p 120. (http://www.attalus.org/armenian/diakph11.htm) Armen Petrosyan clarifies this, suggesting that -ki was a Proto-Armenian form of the Classical Armenian -k' and etymologizes \\"Mush\\" as meaning \\"worker\\" or \\"agriculturalist.\\"Petrosyan, Armen (2002), The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic. pp.140, 146 Some have placed (at least the Eastern) Mushki homeland in the Armenian Highlands and South Caucasus region. It is possible that at least some of the Mushki were Armenian-speakers or speakers of a closely related language. pp.262 Pliny in the 1st century AD mentions the Moscheni in southern Armenia (\\"Armenia\\" at the time stretching south and west to the Mediterranean, bordering on Cappadocia). In Byzantine historiography, Moschoi was a name equivalent to or considered as the ancestors of \\"Cappadocians\\" (Eusebius) with their capital at Mazaca (later Caesarea Mazaca, modern Kayseri). According to Armenian tradition, the city of Mazaca was founded by and named after Mishak (Misak, Moshok), a cousin and general of the legendary patriarch Aram.Ainsworth, William Francis. Travels and Research in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, Chaldea, and Armenia. pp. 222-223. (https://www.google.com/books/edition/Travels_and_Researches_in_Asia_Minor_Mes/-IVxAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&printsec;=frontcover). Scholars have proposed a connection between the name Mishak and Mushki.Petrosyan, Armen (2002), The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic. pp.140Olmstead, A.T. (1929), Two Stone Idols from Asia Minor at the University of Illinois. pp. 313. (https://www.jstor.org/stable/4236961?read- now=1&refreqid;=excelsior%3Aeb2f654f8d09b7b6fd30f32d7d1679fa&seq;=4#page_scan_tab_contents) The Armenian region of Mosk and the city of Mush, Turkey may derive their names from the Mushki. pp.255 pp.140 According to Professor James R. Russell of Harvard University, the Georgian designation for Armenians Somekhi, preserves the old name of the Mushki. However, there are other theories regarding the origins of this exonym as well. Moschoi On this map, based on ancient Greek literary sources, the Moschi are located in the southern approaches of Colchis. London, c 1770Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550 – 476 BCE) speaks of the Moschi as \\"Colchians\\" (perhaps, Georgian speaking), situated next to the Matieni.Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller, Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum I, fragm. 228. According to Herodotus, the equipment of the Moschoi was similar to that of the Tibareni, Macrones, Mossynoeci and Mardae, with wooden caps upon their heads, and shields and small spears, on which long points were set. All these tribes formed the 19th satrapy of the Achaemenid empire, extending along the southeast of the Euxine, or the Black Sea, and bounded on the south by the lofty chain of the Armenian mountains. Strabo locates the Moschoi in two places. The first location is somewhere in modern Abkhazia (Georgia) on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, in agreement with Stephan of Byzantium quoting Hellanicus. The second location Moschice (Moschikê) – in which was a temple of Leucothea, once famous for its wealth, but plundered by Pharnaces and Mithridates – was divided between the Colchians, Armenians, and Iberians (cf. Mela, III. 5.4; Pliny VI.4.). These latter Moschoi were obviously the Georgian Meskhi or Mesx’i (where Greek χ, chi, is Georgian ხ, x). Procopius calls them Meschoi and says that they were subject to the Iberians (i.e., Georgians), and had embraced Christianity, the religion of their masters. Biblical Meshech \\"The World as known to the Hebrews\\", a map from the Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography by Coleman (1854) locates the Mesech together with Gog and Magog in the southern Caucasus. Josephus Flavius identified the Cappadocian Moschoi with the Biblical Japhetic tribe descended from Meshech in his writings on the Genealogy of the Nations in Genesis 10, while Hippolytus of Rome connected Meshech with Illyrians. Meshech is named with Tubal as a principality of the prince of Gog and Magog in Ezekiel 38:2 and 39:1. Mtskhetos and Mtskheta The ancient city of Mtskheta, near Tbilisi, is believed by Georgian experts to be the former capital of the Mushki state. According to the medieval Georgian Chronicles, the city was built by the legendary patriarch Mtskhetos, one of five sons of Kartlos, the legendary patriarch of the Georgian nation (who was in turn said to be a son of Targamos, the Georgian spelling of Biblical Togar Mah, son of Gomer, son of Japheth, son of Noah). According to the Chronicles, during Mtskhetos' lifetime the descendants of Targamos (including Georgians, Armenians, and other Caucasian nations) were united and successfully resisted the attacks of the \\"Nimrodians\\", which Georgian experts interpret as a reference to ancient conflict between the Mushki and Assyria. Excavations in Mtskheta have confirmed the town dates back at least as far as 1000 BC. The Chronicles, the older Conversion of Kartli, and the older still Armenian chronicles of Moses of Chorene all give conflicting accounts of Mtskheta's history prior to and during the conquests of Alexander the Great. According to the Conversion, Mtskheta remained the chief city of \\"Kartli\\", the medieval native name for Georgia, up until Alexander's arrival, who changed the ruling dynasty in Mtskheta by installing Azo, said to be a prince from Arian Kartli. According to the Chronicles, after Mtskhetos' death, Kartli broke up into several smaller, warring regions, until unity was restored by Azo, said to be one of Alexander's Macedonian generals, who was in turn expelled by the (half- Persian) local prince Pharnavaz, and it was Pharnavaz who founded the new ruling dynasty of Kartli. Moses of Chorene says that Alexander installed a Persian satrap named Mithridates in Mtskheta. While Georgian experts disagree over the details of their interpretations of these accounts, they generally agree that they reflect a decline of the Mushki state and rise of Persian influence before the arrival of Alexander, who, perhaps more as a side-effect than by any effort on his part, ushered in a new era of unity in much of the Mushki state's former territories under a new dynasty, who preferred the name Kartli over Mushki. Mtskheta remained the capital of the Kartli state, which became known in most languages as Iberia, until the 5th century AD. Meskheti and the Meskhs People in what is now a south-central Georgian region continued to favor a variant of what may have been the old Mushki name, and today call themselves Meskhs and their region Meskheti. They speak a dialect of Georgian called Meskhuri, which among Georgia's regional dialects is relatively close to official Georgian. The town of Mtskheta is not in today's Meskheti region, but lies about 100 km to its northeast, in the Kartli region.

Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that laws with religious origins are not unconstitutional if they have a secular purpose.. Background A large discount store in Anne Arundel County, Maryland was fined for selling goods on a Sunday, in violation of a local blue law. The Court rejected an establishment clause challenge to laws saying that most large-scale commercial enterprises remain closed on Sundays. The Court's review of the history demonstrated that Sunday closing laws were originally efforts to promote church attendance. \\"But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws, non religious arguments for Sunday closing began to be heard more distinctly.\\" The Court said that the Constitution does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some or all religions. It concluded that, as currently written and administered, most Sunday closing laws are of a secular rather than religious character. They provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens. To say that the State cannot prescribe Sunday as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago such laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional interpretation of hostility to the public welfare rather than one of mere separation of church and state. Constitutional text The relevant clauses of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution: =The 1st Amendment= :Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. =Section 1 of the 14th Amendment= :All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The court's decision The Court held that Maryland's laws did not violate the First Amendment. The plaintiffs claimed only economic injury, not that they had been prevented from the free exercise of their religion. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Warren concluded: :[The] appellants allege only economic injury to themselves; they do not allege any infringement of their own religious freedoms due to Sunday closing. In fact, the record is silent as to what appellants' religious beliefs are. Since the general rule is that \\"a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities,\\" (United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 22) we hold that appellants have no standing to raise this contention. The Court also held that the law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren again: :...the Court has [previously] held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power [even when], in practice, their laws result in some inequality. In reaching their conclusion, the Court also examined the wider question of whether laws proscribing or limiting Sunday trading were constitutional. They held that such laws did not violate the division between church and state, because - no matter the historical roots of such laws - the laws existed as constituted in order to fulfill a secular objective. In other words, even if Sunday trading laws were originally intended to facilitate and encourage church attendance in the colonial United States, the laws as presently constituted were intended to improve the \\"health, safety, recreation, and general well-being\\" of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all; the fact that this day is of particular significance for one or more religions does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals in this manner. In a dissent, Justice Douglas argued that the Sunday closing laws were an attempt by the Protestant majority to impose its beliefs on the country. He wrote: :The Court picks and chooses language from various decisions to bolster its conclusion that these Sunday laws, in the modern setting, are \\"civil regulations.\\" No matter how much is written, no matter what is said, the parentage of these laws is the Fourth Commandment, and they serve and satisfy the religious predispositions of our Christian communities. (Also:) “The First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish — whether the result is to produce Catholics, Jews, or Protestants, or to turn the people toward the path of Buddha, or to end in a predominantly Moslem nation, or to produce in the long run atheists or agnostics. On matters of this kind government must be neutral.”  See also  * Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Massachusetts, Inc.

The inn was extensively damaged by fire on 27 February 2004, and after repairs and rebuilding were completed the Fleece officially reopened on 18 June 2005. The pub holds an annual asparagus festival and auction while there are three morris sides based at the pub: Pebworth, Belle d'Vain and Asum Gras. There is a regular folk night plus concerts and weddings in the medieval barn. History Owned by the National Trust, The Fleece Inn was originally built in the early 15th century as a longhouse (an early type of farmhouse accommodating both livestock and humans) by a prosperous yeoman farmer called Byrd. It later became a pub, which was rebuilt in the 17th century and remained in the Byrd family until 1977, when Lola Taplin bequeathed it to the National Trust. Lola was a direct descendant of Mr Byrd, and lived her entire life at the Fleece. She died at 77, having run the pub on her own for the last 30 years of her life. The Inn suffered serious fire damage after a fire broke out in the thatch in February 2004, and the business temporarily moved to a nearby barn during the 14 month long restoration. Reputedly Oliver Cromwell’s pewter dinner service was exchanged on the way to the battle of Worcester and this is on display at the pub. Even if this account is not true, it is an example of 17th century Jacobean English Pewter ware. A curious medieval tradition also survives at the Fleece, preserved in accordance with Lola's wishes. This is the practice of chalking \\"witch circles\\" on the floor in front of each hearth to prevent witches from getting in through the chimneys. There are also \\"witch marks\\" on the inside of the door, to keep evil spirits out.

Excavations that began in 1956 succeeded in uncovering the fortified city of Hasanlu, once thought to be a potential Mannaean site. More recently, the site of Qalaichi (possibly ancient Izirtu/Zirta) has been linked to the Mannaeans based on a stela with this toponym found at the site. After suffering several defeats at the hands of both Scythians and Assyrians, the remnants of the Mannaean populace were absorbed by the Matieni and the area became known as Matiene.The Cambridge history of Iran, Volume 2 by William Bayne Fisher, Ilya Gershevitch, Ehsan Yar-Shater, Peter Avery, pages 256-257Archaeology at the north-east Anatolian frontier, I.: an historical geography and a field survey of the Bayburt Province by A.

Zadok\\" According to the Archaeological Institute of America, 1964: In the Bible (Jeremiah 51:27), the Mannaeans are called \\"Minni\\". The Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), identified Minni with Armenia, or one of the provinces in ancient Armenia; Minni, Ararat and Ashkenaz. According to examinations of the place and personal names found in Assyrian and Urartian texts, the Mannaeans, or at least their rulers, spoke Hurrian, a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European language related to Urartian, with no modern language connections. History The Mannaean kingdom began to flourish around 850 BC. The Mannaeans were mainly a settled people, practicing irrigation and breeding cattle and horses. The capital was another fortified city, Izirtu (Zirta). By the 820s BC they had expanded to become the first large state to occupy this region since the Gutians, later followed by the unrelated Iranian peoples, the Medes and the Persians. By this time they had a prominent aristocracy as a ruling class, which somewhat limited the power of the king. Beginning around 800 BC, the region became contested ground between Urartu, who built several forts on the territory of Mannae, and Assyria. During the open conflict between the two, c. 750–730 BC, Mannae seized the opportunity to enlarge its holdings. The Mannaean kingdom reached the pinnacle of its power during the reign of Iranzu (c. 725–720 BC). In 716 BC, king Sargon II of Assyria moved against Mannae, where the ruler Aza, son of Iranzu, had been deposed by Ullusunu with the help of the Urartians. Sargon took Izirtu, and stationed troops in Parsua (Parsua was distinct from Parsumash located further southeast in what is today known as Fars province in Iran. The Assyrians thereafter used the area to breed, train and trade horses. According to one Assyrian inscription, the Cimmerians (Gimirru) originally went forth from their homeland of Gamir or Uishdish on the shores of the Black Sea in \\"the midst of Mannai\\" around this time. The Cimmerians first appear in the annals in the year 714 BC, when they apparently helped the Assyrians to defeat Urartu. Urartu chose to submit to the Assyrians, and together the two defeated the Cimmerians and thus kept them out of the Fertile Crescent. At any rate, the Cimmerians had again rebelled against Sargon by 705, and he was killed whilst driving them out. By 679 they had instead migrated to the east and west of Mannae. The Mannaeans are recorded as rebelling against Esarhaddon of Assyria in 676 BC, when they attempted to interrupt the horse trade between Assyria and its colony of Parsuash. The king Ahsheri, who ruled until the 650s BC, continued to enlarge the territory of Mannae, although paying tribute to Assyria. However, Mannae suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Assyrians around 660 BC, and subsequently an internal revolt broke out, continuing until Ahsheri's death. Also in the 7th century BC, Mannae was defeated by the advancing Scythians, who had already raided Urartu and been repelled by the Assyrians. This defeat contributed to the further break-up of the Mannaean kingdom. King Ahsheri's successor, Ualli, as an ally of Assyria, took the side of the Assyrians against the Iranian Medes (Madai), who were at this point still based to the east along the southwest shore of the Caspian Sea and revolting against Assyrian domination. The Medes and Persians were subjugated by Assyria. However, the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which had dominated the region for three hundred years, began to unravel, consumed by civil war after the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC. The upheavals in Assyria allowed the Medes to free themselves from Assyrian vassalage and make themselves the major power in ancient Iran at the expense of the Persians, Mannaeans and the remnants of the indigenous Elamites whose kingdom had been destroyed by the Assyrians. At the battle of Qablin in ca. 616 BC the Assyrian and Mannaean forces were defeated by Nabopolassar's troops. This defeat laid open the frontiers of the Land of the Manneans which fell under the control of Media between 615 BC and 611 BC.The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 2 : page 122 See also *Gawirkayeti *History of Iran *Median Empire References External links *Mannaean glazed bricks from Bukan Ancient history of Iran Ancient Near East History of Iranian Azerbaijan Hurrians ","title":"Mannaeans"},{"id":"1206051","title":"Swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"1206053","text":"Monster Movie is the debut studio album by German rock band Can, released in August 1969 by Music Factory and Liberty Records.

The series was developed as an \\"extreme\\" revamp and spin-off of The Ren & Stimpy Show, which previously aired on the American cable network Nickelodeon, and is known for being significantly more vulgar and inappropriate than the original series. The series originally ran from June 26 to July 24, 2003, and was abruptly removed from the network after just three episodes. It received negative reception from both fans and critics. History The original Ren & Stimpy Show premiered alongside Rugrats and Doug as one of the original Nicktoons on children's network Nickelodeon in 1991. The show's creator, John Kricfalusi, had many altercations with the network, eventually culminating in his termination.\\"'Ren & Stimpy' go on without their creator\\", USA Today, September 25, 1992 In 2002, about a decade after Kricfalusi's termination, Viacom (which owns Nickelodeon) contacted him to produce a new version of his series for an updated version of TNN, Spike TV, which was devoted to programming for male audiences. Kricfalusi said that TNN wanted an \\"extreme\\" version of The Ren & Stimpy Show. TNN gave Kricfalusi greater control of the writing and contents of the episodes, and he produced six new cartoons aimed at adult audiences. Some of the head storyboard artists, screenwriters, and animators returned from the original Ren and Stimpy series, such as Vincent Waller, Eddie Fitzgerald, and Jim Smith, but most of the animation and writing team were a new team of artists, specifically instructed and headed by Kricfalusi himself. In a similar vein to the original series, Kricfalusi ran into problems with meeting production deadlines, with only three out of the nine episodes ordered by the network being completed on time. Some of the original voice cast members returned, with the notable exception of Billy West, original voice of Stimpy and second voice of Ren and Mr. Horse, who turned down the role, as he did not consider it funny and that participating in it would damage his career. Eric Bauza was hired to replace West as Stimpy, while Kricfalusi reprised his roles as Ren and Mr. Horse. Cast members Harris Peet and Cheryl Chase also returned, and Kricfalusi's father Mike Kricfalusi and long-time childhood friend Tom Hay provided some voices. All of the episodes were animated at Carbunkle Cartoons, in association with Big Star Productions. Kricfalusi had previously relied upon Carbunkle during the Nickelodeon years, and he subcontracted animation of many original series episodes (including \\"Space Madness\\", \\"Black Hole\\" and \\"The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen\\") to that studio. The new series began airing in June 2003 as part of an animation block also featuring Gary the Rat, Stripperella, and digitally remastered episodes of the original Ren and Stimpy series, subtitled \\"Digitally Remastered Classics\\". Kricfalusi wrote the first episode, \\"Onward and Upward\\", based on requests from fans from the Nickelodeon era. The episode portrayed the characters as bisexual. Advertisers objected to some of the new show's content, particularly that of the risqué episode \\"Naked Beach Frenzy\\" which did not air in the show's original run, causing trouble with scheduling. The show stopped airing after three episodes when TNN's animation block was \\"put on hold\\". The remaining episodes were set to resume in August 2004 along with the premiere of Spike's new animated series Immigrants but both shows were pulled and never aired again.http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/07/19/spike-tv-slates- immigrants-preview-ren-and-stimpy-return-16680/6663/ Kricfalusi shut down Spümcø shortly thereafter following a lawsuit filed by Carbunkle for failing to pay the animation studio for their services. In 2005, he announced that all of the Adult Party Cartoon cartoons that were fully produced were coming to DVD, which was released on July 18, 2006. Episodes =Cancelled Episodes= * Life Sucks - Ren explains to Stimpy that life sucks, much to Stimpy's horror. After that, they have an extensive look at life's past tragedies like the Children's Crusade. According to John Kricfalusi himself, this was meant to be a prequel episode to Ren Seeks Help. This is suggesting that this episode was the cause of Ren and Stimpy's argument, as it is never stated in \\"Ren Seeks Help\\" what Ren had done exactly. Production had begun on this episode, with some voice work and roughly a third of the storyboard completed at the time of the show's cancellation.

They finally settle the argument by making a bet that they can switch roles for a day. The episode's basic premise would somewhat be loosely made into the Games Animation era episode, \\"Who's Stupid Now?\\". * Fishing Trip - Ren & Stimpy go on a fishing trip in search of the elusive foul-mouthed bass. The episode's basic premise is loosely related to the season 3 episode \\"Bass Masters\\" and the unproduced Spümcø episode \\"The Wilderness Adventure.\\" * The Wilderness Adventure - George Liquor takes Ren & Stimpy hunting in the deep woods. The episode was originally written for Nickelodeon, but was rejected several times. Michael Pataki was made to reprise his role as George Liquor. The storyboard for the rejected episode, however, were completed all the way back in the 90s, as far as before the show actually started production, as one of the ideas would later used in the season 2 episode The Great Outdoors. Two small portions of some of the storyboards of this episode had some voice work, sound effects, and music completed and put into part of the episode before the show's cancellation.http://www.whataboutthad.com/2011/04/14/storyboard-the- wilderness- adventure/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY1pJ8eE7fchttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NbmVR6-rzs * My Little Ass - A fake commercial that was suppose to be parody the series, My Little Pony.

The episode was left unfinished.https://www.cartoonbrew.com/old-brew/the-john-kricfalusi-interview- part-2-434.html =Broadcast and DVD release= The episode \\"Man's Best Friend\\" was originally set to air in the original series' second season, but the episode was rejected by Nickelodeon due to disturbing violence and references to tobacco. The episode did not air on television until 2003. TNN's official episode lineup on their website seemed to suggest that they consider the episode Man's Best Friend a part of the Ren & Stimpy \\"Adult Party Cartoon\\" series, but this episode in general is not counted as one of the three episodes from this series that did air in the U.S. The first new episode that aired on TNN was Onward and Upward, and Ren Seeks Help was the second. The episode Fire Dogs 2 was the last episode to air on TNN. The three episodes Naked Beach Frenzy, Altruists, and Stimpy's Pregnant did not originally air on TNN, though they did air on other networks overseas, including Fox in Italy and MTV in Poland. They were also included in the Ren & Stimpy: The Lost Episodes DVD set that was released on July 18, 2006.  Reception  DVD Talk panned the series, writing, \\"Even with a few bright spots [...] [Ren & Stimpy \\"Adult Party Cartoon\\" is] a mostly dismal affair that will sharply divide fans of the series.\\" PopMatters was more favorable, writing: \\"With snot as side dishes and vomit as gravy, the foulness is overwhelming, yet also clever. Kricfalusi's satire may be obvious, but he's not just making puke jokes for nausea's sake.\\" The series became one of the worst tv series ever.

It was created and incorporated in 1977 by Wendy and Richard Pini. The company title is an acronym formed from the founding couple's name: Wendy and Richard Pini (in later years the capitalization was changed from WaRP to Warp, a mostly aesthetic move). In addition to Elfquest, Warp also published several other comic book series, including MythAdventures and related titles by Robert Asprin, and Thunder Bunny, created by Martin Greim. Warp was also the original publisher of A Distant Soil by Colleen Doran, until Doran left under acrimonious circumstances, alleging that WaRP attempted to claim copyright on her work, which WaRP denied.\\"The Battle for A Distant Soil,\\" The Comics Journal #108 (May 1986), pp. 7-12.\\"Doran/WaRP Dispute Now Settled,\\" The Comics Journal #110 (August 1986), p. 17. Warp sued licensee publisher Starblaze Graphics for, among other issues, publication of unauthorized Elfquest reprints, inaccurate reporting of royalties, but primarily for tortious interference in Warp's contract with Doran (who was also named in the Donning lawsuit), by attempting to assume the rights to A Distant Soil.\\"NewsWatch: WaRP files $4 million lawsuit,\\" The Comics Journal #115 (April 1987), pp. 11-12.

All rights previously licensed to Donning in Elfquest reverted to Warp; Warp reverted all rights in A Distant Soil to Doran. History = Apple Comics = From 1978 through 1984, Warp Graphics published the 20-issue original Elfquest series. When Elfquest subsequently went on hiatus to allow artist Wendy Pini to recuperate from hip replacement surgery, publisher Richard Pini began to contract the work of other writers and artists, to establish a line of generally fantasy-oriented comics titles. In 1986, Pini turned Warp's publishing and marketing duties over to Michael Catron's Apple Comics so that Warp could concentrate on editing its comics titles.\\"WaRP Titles Now Under Apple Aegis,\\" The Comics Journal #110 (August 1986), p. 17. Titles packaged by Warp for Apple included the anthology series FantaSci, Vietnam Journal, and Lee Marrs's Unicorn Isle (which ran to #5 of a projected 12 issues). In 1987, Apple Comics took over editing duties on all the other titles, and Warp concentrated solely on producing new Elfquest series. In 1990 Warp and Apple parted ways. In 1992 Warp launched the first of several new Elfquest spin-off series (Hidden Years). Shortly thereafter, Warp for the first time invited other writers and artists to join in the creation of new Elfquest material.\\"Newswatch: Hirings and Firings: Barry Blair Joins Warp Graphics,\\" The Comics Journal #167 (April 1994), p. 32. Beginning in 1997, WaRP also published a few Elflord comics by Barry Blair and Colin Chan, who had also written for Elfquest. From 1992 to 2002 Warp Graphics worked with a number of free-lance artists and writers to produce and publish several Elfquest related titles. In 2002, the company downsized to its original owners, Wendy and Richard Pini in order to concentrate solely on producing canonical Elfquest material. = Father Tree Press imprint = Warp also launched a book publishing imprint, Father Tree Press (named after the Wolfriders' original tree-home in Elfquest), primarily reprinting Elfquest stories. The imprint also appeared on Chroma, a book on the artwork of Alex Schomburg, and Law and Chaos, a chronicle of Wendy Pini's early attempt to adapt Michael Moorcock's Stormbringer saga into an animated film. Warp and Father Tree Press still exist; while they are not currently publishing new Elfquest books in printed comic or book format, they continue to publish both existing and new Elfquest material digitally online. They also published, from 2007 to 2010, both in print and digitally, Wendy Pini's non-Elfquest graphic novel Masque of the Red Death, a futuristic reimagining of the Edgar Allan Poe short story. = Partnership with DC = In 2003 the Pinis licensed the worldwide publication and media rights in Elfquest to DC Comics.http://www.elfquest.com/news/EQDC.html DC put out two series of \\"manga- style\\" digest reprints (now complete), the first four volumes of an archive reprint series, one new graphic novel, and a four-part comic series entitled Discovery, which has since been collected. DC and Warp parted ways in 2007, when Warp opted not to renew the DC contract. =Partnership with Warner Bros. = In 2008, Warp Graphics licensed the media rights in Elfquest to Warner Bros.http://www.elfquest.com/news/Movie3.html with the aim of turning the comic book series into a motion picture. A director and screenwriter, Rawson Thurber, were attached to the project and several versions of a script, as well as some production artwork, were completed.

Confessor of the Faith Its oldest use is to indicate a saint who has suffered persecution and torture for the faith but not to the point of death.Beccari, Camillo. \\"Confessor.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 June 2018 The term is still used that way in the East. In Latin Christianity it has come to signify any saint, as well as those who have been declared blessed, who cannot be categorized by another title: martyr, apostle, evangelist, or virgin. As Christianity emerged as the dominant religion in Europe, persecutions became rare, and the title was given to saints who lived a holy life and died in peace. A notable example of this usage is the English king St. Edward the Confessor. Confession of sins During the Diocletianic Persecution, a number of Christians had, under torture or threat of torture, weakened in their profession of the faith. When the persecutions ceased under Constantine the Great, they wanted to be reunited with the Church. It became the practice of the penitents to go to the Confessors, those who had willingly suffered for the faith and survived, to plead their case and effect their restoration to communion. Thus, the word has come to denote any priest who has been granted the authority to hear confessions. This type of confessor may also be referred to as a \\"spiritual father.\\" In the case of a monarch, the confessor might also fill the role of confidential and disinterested advisor. In this sense of the term, it is standard practice for a religious community of women, either if enclosed or just very large, to have a priest, to serve as confessor to the community, serving their spiritual needs. It can also be used as the title of the head of a religious society.

It uses a patented 10-round rotary magazine, though higher capacity box magazines are also available. The standard Carbine version of the Ruger 10/22 has been in production continuously since 1964,Wood, J.B., Firearms Assembly / Disassembly Part III: Rimfire Rifles Revised Edition, DBI Books, 1994, p.331 making it one of the most successful rimfire rifle designs in history, with numerous third party manufacturers making parts and accessories for upgrading and customization. In fact, the 10/22's aftermarket is so prolific, that a 10/22 can be built with completely non-Ruger made components. A magnum version of the 10/22, known as the 10/22 Magnum, chambered for the .22 WMR cartridge, was made from 1998 to 2006. A .17 HMR version, the 10/17, was announced in 2004 but was only listed in the catalog for two years.  Uses and customization  Ruger 10/22 highly customized by Clark Custom Guns. Clear/red magazines are 40th anniversary edition. Ruger 10/22 Custom with an Butler Creek folding stock and a Millett DMS-1 rifle scope 1-4 X 24mm The 10/22 was immediately popular upon its release. It was designed as a quality adult gun with adult ergonomics and not a stereotypically cheap \\"youth rifle\\". It was styled as reminiscent of the U.S. 30 caliber M1 carbine adding to its appeal. Its easy handling characteristics, negligible recoil, and inexpensive ammunition nonetheless make it ideal for young or inexperienced shooters. It is very popular for small-game hunters and those who want an inexpensive rifle for firing inexpensive ammunition for target and plinking use.\\"50 Years Of Ruger Genius\\" Guns Magazine, Sept, 1999 by Clair Rees This popularity has led to many after-market modifications being available to improve performance, augment the rifle's looks, or increase its magazine capacity, making the 10/22 one of the most customizable firearms ever made.The Ruger 1022 Exotic Weapons System, Paperback: 96 pages, Paladin Press Revised edition (Mar. 1989) Custom manufacturers also make \\"clones\\" of the 10/22, which are similar in design (most parts will interchange) but built to much higher specifications and costs. The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two- screw, V-block system to attach the barrel to the receiver, making removal and replacement of the barrel (which would require a gunsmith's work with most other rifles) very easy. This, when combined with the simple construction of the rest of the components, means that the average person can easily replace any part in the gun with nothing more than a screwdriver, a hex key and simple punches. Ruger 10/22 \\"Stainless\\" With an aftermarket Butler Creek Folding Stock and a TRUGLO Red Dot Sight Variations Ruger 10/22 International model, which comes with a full-length Mannlicher style stock The 10/22 is available in a wide variety of configurations. In 2015, the Ruger 10/22 came in 11 different models, not counting distributor exclusives. The Carbine came in three models; the Tactical, Takedown and Target each had two models; the Sporter and Compact each had one model. The discontinued 10/22 International model was fitted with a Mannlicher stock. Standard barrel lengths are 20\\" in the 10/22 Rifle, 18\\" in the 10/22 Carbine, and 16\\" in the 10/22 Compact Rifle which is also fitted with a shorter stock. All .22 Long Rifle versions use an aluminum receiver, while the discontinued .22 Magnum version used a steel receiver with integral scope bases. =10/22 Carbine= Standard model with 18.5\\" barrel. Offered with hardwood or black synthetic stocks, black alloy, or stainless steel receivers and a model fitted with LaserMax laser sight.  10/22 Target  Target shooting model with heavy 20\\" bull barrel with no iron sights.  10/22 Target Lite  Introduced in 2018 the Target Lite is similar to the Target model but with a laminate thumbhole stock.  10/22 Compact  Compact rifle with 16.12\\" barrel.  10/22 Sporter  Model with 18.5\\", alternatively 20\\" or 22\\", barrel and checkered walnut stock with sling swivels.  10/22 Tactical  A model with 16.12\\" fitted with flash suppressor.

The receiver incorporates a rear cleaning port and an integral, optics-ready 30 MOA Picatinny rail. The rifle also has an enhanced semi-auto chamber, BX-Trigger, heat-treated and nitrided CNC-machined match bolt, 16-1/8\\" cold hammer-forged bull free-floating barrel which is fluted to reduce weight and dissipate heat and is also threaded with a 1/2\\"-28 pattern to accommodate the included muzzle brake or other barrel accessories.https://gunsmagazine.com/rifles/ruger-10-22-custom-competition/  50th Anniversary Rifle  In 2014 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Ruger 10/22 a contest was held to design an anniversary model. The winning design by public vote has a stainless steel 18.5\\" threaded barrel with flash suppressor, a lightweight black synthetic stock with interchangeable stock modules, a picatinny rail and ghost-ring adjustable rear sight.  Collector's Series  A limited edition 50th Anniversary Collector's Series Carbine model was offered in 2014. It had a black alloy receiver with \\"1964-2014\\" special markings, 18.5\\" barrel, fiber optic sights, and a 25-round magazine.  Collector's Series Second Edition  In June 2015, Ruger announced a limited Second Edition of the Collector's Series 10/22 carbine. It features a dark grey version of Ruger's Modular Stock System found on the Ruger American Rimfire rifle, a protected non-glare blade front sight, ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight, and a Picatinny rail. VLEH Target Tactical Rifle In 2009 Ruger also announced the Target Tactical Rifle model, a hybrid of the 10/22T and Ruger M77 Hawkeye Tactical rifle. V - Varmint barrel, L - Law + E - Enforcement model, H - Hogue stock. =10/22 Takedown= On March 28, 2012, Ruger introduced the 10/22 Takedown model. This model disassembles into barrel and action/buttstock components easily. It is shipped in a backpack style case that has room for the rifle, ammunition, and accessories. The MSRP is higher than the basic carbine models. The standard Takedown model has a brushed aluminum receiver made to resemble stainless steel and 18.5\\" barrel with a black synthetic stock. Also offered in a black alloy receiver and 16.12\\" threaded barrel with a flash suppressor or with a threaded, fluted target barrel. 10/22 Takedown Lite The Takedown Lite models are similar to the other Takedown models but has a lightweight target barrel design. =SR-22 Rifle= In 2009, Ruger released the SR-22 Rifle model, a 10/22 receiver embedded in a chassis that mimics the dimensions of an AR-15 style rifle such as their own SR-556. The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 rotary magazines, in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines. The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by Colt and Smith & Wesson. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. Threaded holes on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails. =22 Charger Pistol= Ruger Charger. Comes with bipod. Shown with aftermarket Truglo multi-color reflexive dot scope and Ruger BX-25 extended magazine. The 22 Charger pistol, first introduced in late 2007, is a pistol based on the 10/22 action. The 22 Charger originally came with a black laminated wood pistol stock with forend, a matte blued heavy barrel, a bipod, and a Weaver style scope base in lieu of iron sights. Overall length is just under , making it quite large for a handgun. As it has an included bipod it is likely to be used from a shooting bench or table. The bipod attaches to a sling swivel on the stock fore-end and is easily removable. Due to technical features, such as the magazine being outside the pistol grip, the Charger is not legally available in some U.S. states. The 22 Charger was later discontinued. It was reintroduced in December 2014, with a brown laminate stock with a M16A2 style pistol grip, 10-inch threaded barrel, picatinny rail, 15-round magazine and adjustable bipod. At the same time a \\"Takedown\\" model was introduced with a green laminate stock. Both models were later offered from September 2015 with black polymer stocks. =10/22 Magnum= The 10/22 Magnum was produced from 1998–2006 and was chambered for the .22 Magnum cartridge.https://www.ruger.com/service/productHistory/RI-10-22M.html =10/17= The 10/17 was announced in 2004 and was chambered for the .17 HMR cartridge.

The modified target version includes an 18 inch bull barrel, a muzzle brake, a laminated wood silhouette style stock, and a scope with an illuminated reticle, in addition to internal modifications of the trigger group to improve the firing characteristics. See the entry on accurizing for more information on the reasons for these modifications. A wide variety of aftermarket modification kits are offered for the 10/22, including conversions to bullpup configuration and cosmetic alterations to replicate the appearance of weapons like the M1 Carbine, Thompson submachine gun, FN P90, and AR-15. =AWC Ultra II= The integrally- suppressed AWC Ultra II The AWC Ultra II is a modified version of the Ruger 10/22 made by AWC Systech and has an integrally-suppressed shortened barrel. The sound suppressor encloses a ported stainless barrel and is made of 300 series stainless steel having a 1\\" diameter which closely resembles a bull barrel. The barrel length is 16.5\\" with an overall weapon length of 34\\" and the weight is 6 lbs. Due to the integral suppressor, this model is a Title II weapon in the U.S.2009 AWC Product Guide, p. 7. =AT 10/22 QD= The AT 10/22 QD is a short-barreled modified version of the 10/22 made by Arms Tech Limited. It features a six-inch barrel, a folding stock, and is designed to accept Arms Tech's own QD-223 suppressor. It comes in at a mere 5 pounds without the suppressor. Due to its extremely short barrel, it is considered a Title II weapon in the U.S.http://www.armstechltd.com/products.php?id=at10-22  Copies  = AMT Lightning 25/22 = The AMT Lightning 25/22 was a .22 LR- caliber semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Arcadia Machine & Tool (AMT).

Magazines  The \\"40th anniversary edition\\" BX-1CLR rotary magazine for Ruger 10/22. The clear body of the magazines shows its unusual rotary operation;\\"Autoloading rifles\\" at Ruger-firearms.com\\"Hornady's Sweet Seventeen\\" by Rick Jamison, Shooting Times\\"Rotary magazine for firearm with hold-open lever\\" Patent the red cogwheel-like part is the rotary cartridge holder/follower. Two aftermarket 25-round magazines attached in Jungle style. There are many types of magazines for the Ruger 10/22. The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round polymer rotary magazine, the BX-1. Ruger has also introduced a transparent polycarbonate version (\\"40th- anniversary edition\\") of the BX-1 called the BX-1CLR, as well as a 1-round version for training and a 5-round version for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities. In 2011–2012, Ruger came out with the BX-25, a curved 25-round box magazine with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round BX-15 box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities. Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round drum magazines. The standard BX-1 rotary magazine stores the cartridges in a cogwheel-like holder, rather than stacked as seen in a box magazine. This allows the magazine to be very compact and fit flush into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry. The bolt of the rifle pushes a cartridge from the metal feeding lip of the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place. Due to its time-tested reliability, the rotary magazine is also used by the Ruger's American Rimfire series bolt-action rifles, as well as the 10/22-footprinted \\"Summit\\" toggle-action rifles produced by Primary Weapon Systems/Vorquartsen. Even Ruger's market competitor Savage Arms has recently adopted a detachable rotary magazine design similar to the BX-1 in its new A series (semi-automatic) and B series (bolt-action) rimfire rifles. Not all Ruger 10/22 magazines are interchangeable. The owners manual for the 10/22 Magnum model states, \\"Do not attempt to use standard 10/22 magazines in the 10/22 Magnum rifles or load .22 Short, Long, or Long Rifle ammunition into the .22 Magnum. They will not function correctly and are unsafe to use in .22 Magnum rifles.\\" It goes on to say, \\"Never attempt to use .22 Long Rifle ammunition in Ruger 10/22 Magnum rifle magazines. The cartridges have a smaller case diameter and can split or burst when fired in the larger magnum chamber, releasing hot powder gasses and particle fragments out of the action at high speed, possibly resulting in injury to the shooter or bystanders.\\" Users *: The Ruger 10/22 has seen limited use by the Israel Defense Force in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a “less than lethal” weapon for security and crowd or “riot” control purposes in the Palestinian territories. The IDF uses a modified carbine rifle version with a scope and a suppressor, which would allow for silent operation with no loud noises to indicate the shot’s origin.

After a few days being stranded, the group sees a passing mail plane high in the sky. They try to attract the pilot's attention, but he is too far away to see them. More days pass, and the group continues to ration their dwindling supplies and battle the subfreezing temperatures. To keep warm they begin to break up the church's pews and other furnishings to use as firewood in the room's potbelly stove. The group's desperation intensifies, as does a romance between Bill and Billie. Soon Bill confides to her that he too is a wanted criminal, a fugitive from Saint Paul, Minnesota. As conditions worsen, The Kid collapses from hunger and become delirious; and the church's interior becomes almost bare as more furnishings—even the church's pulpit and pump organ—are consigned to the stove. Bill and Billie finally commit to leaving to avoid being imprisoned if the group is somehow rescued. They quietly depart during the night, hoping to reach a ranger station ten miles away. Everyone else is sleeping except Dan, the deputy sheriff, who sees the two leaving; but he does nothing to stop them. After walking a short distance through snowdrifts, Bill and Billie hear and then see a search plane slowly circling overhead at low altitude. Realizing that the others inside the church will not hear the plane's engine, they rush back and awaken them. The group hurriedly builds a signal fire, which the plane's pilot sees. He parachutes a box of provisions to them with a note saying that help will be sent immediately. The next day the group sees a rescue party heading toward the church. While awaiting their rescuers, Dan observes Bill and Billie sitting together on the floor. From his coat pocket Dan pulls out Billie's extradition papers and a \\"wanted\\" notice that includes a photograph of Bill and information about his being a fugitive from Saint Paul. Dan walks over to the stove, now cold from no fires, and tosses both papers into it. Bill and Billie see him discard the papers, and they look at one another. Bill then gets up, retrieves the papers from the stove, gives them back to Dan, and asks him to drop him off in Saint Paul on his way back to New York with Billie.

Taxonomy It is closely related to silver fir, Abies alba, which replaces it in the Apennine Mountains of Italy and elsewhere further north in Europe; some botanists treat Sicilian fir as a variety of silver fir, as Abies alba var. nebrodensis. Description It is a medium- size evergreen coniferous tree growing to 15–25 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m. The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.5–2.5 cm long and 2 mm wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two greenish- white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is blunt with a notched tip, but sometimes with a pointed tip, particularly on shoots high on older trees. The cones are 10–16 cm long and 4 cm broad, with about 150 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds. Distribution Despite its scientific name, the species is of Mt. Scalone in the Madonie Mountains in the north-central part of Sicily.Abies nebrodensis. - distribution map, genetic conservation units and related resources. European Forest Genetic Resources Programme (EUFORGEN) Ecology It occurs at altitudes of 1400-1,600 metres. It is limited to the steep, dry slopes. Conservation As a result of deforestation, it is now extremely rare, with only 25 mature trees surviving; replanting programmes are meeting with limited success due to heavy grazing pressure by livestock belonging to local farmers. It was classified as 'critically endangered' in the IUCN Red List in 2017. In the European Union it has been designated as a 'priority species' under Annex II of the Habitats Directive, which means areas in which it occurs can be declared Special Areas of Conservation, if these areas belong to one of the number of habitats listed in Annex I of the directive.

Philip Sponenberg for a group of horse breed and feral populations descended from the original Iberian horse stock brought from Spain to the Americas. The ancestral type from which these horses descend was a product of the horse populations that blended between the Iberian horse and the North African Barb. The term encompasses many strains or breeds now found primarily in North America. The status of the Colonial Spanish horse is considered threatened overall with seven individual strains specifically identified. The horses are registered by several entities. The Colonial Spanish horse, a general classification, is not synonymous with the Spanish Mustang, the name given to a specific standardized breed derived from the first concerted effort of conservationists in the United States to preserve horses of Colonial Spanish Type. Colonial Spanish horse blood markers have been found in some mustang populations. Small groups of horses of Colonial Spanish horse type have been located in various groups of ranch-bred, mission, and Native American horses, mostly among those in private ownership. Characteristics Colonial Spanish horses are generally small; the usual height is around , and most vary from . Weight varies with height, but most are around . Their heads vary somewhat between long, finely made to shorter and deeper, generally having straight to concave (rarely slightly convex) foreheads and a nose that is straight or slightly convex. The muzzle is usually very fine, and from the side the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, although the teeth meet evenly. Nostrils are usually small and crescent shaped. They typically have narrow but deep chests, with the front legs leaving the body fairly close together. When viewed from the front, the front legs join the chest in an \\"A\\" shape rather than straight across as in most other modern breeds that have wider chests. The withers are usually sharp instead of low and meaty. The croup is sloped, and the tail is characteristically set low on the body. From the rear view they are usually \\"rafter hipped\\" meaning the muscling of the hip tapers up so the backbone is the highest point. Hooves are small and upright rather than flat. History in the Americas Horses first returned to the Americas with the conquistadors, beginning with Columbus, who imported horses from Spain to the West Indies on his second voyage in 1493.Bennett, p. 14 Domesticated horses came to the mainland with the arrival of Cortés in 1519.Bennett, p. 193 By 1525, Cortés had imported enough horses to create a nucleus of horse-breeding in Mexico.Bennett, p. 205 Horses arrived in South America beginning in 1531, and, by 1538, Florida, and scattered throughout the Americas. By one estimate there were at least 10,000 free-roaming horses in Mexico by 1553. In 2010, the Colonial Spanish mustang was voted the official state horse of North Carolina. Modern horses Many gaited horse and stock horse breeds in the United States descend from Spanish horses, but only a few bloodlines are considered to be near-pure descendants of original Spanish stock. Though many are described as horse breeds, it can be debated they are separate breeds or multiple strains of a single large breed. The Livestock Conservancy lists them as one breed, but also calls them \\"a group of closely related breeds\\" Various bloodlines or groups of Colonial Spanish horses are registered a number of different Associations. While some bands of modern mustangs have evidence of ancsetry from the original Spanish imports, genetic analysis indicates that many free-ranging horses in the Great Basin descend from later breeds of draft horse, cavalry mounts, and other saddle horses. Where they have been found to have descended from the original Spanish horses, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other agencies attempt to preserve them. Blood typing, along with phenotype and historical documentation have been used to confirm significant Spanish ancestry of a few BLM managed herds. In 1985, the BLM awarded a grant to the University of California, Davis, to conduct a three-year study on mustang genetics, including the percentage of original Spanish blood. Ann T. Bowling and R. W. Touchberry did not find much evidence of Spanish genetics in the Great Basin horses tested, but follow up work by Gus Cothran, then of University of Kentucky, carried on the study and found Spanish markers in the Pryor Mountain and Cerbat herds outside the Great Basin, and Sulphur Springs herd within it, later confirming the findings for the Sulphur Springs herd through mtDNA sequencing analysis. Some breeders and horse associations have used blood typing results to prove or disprove horses being of Spanish ancestry, but some horses of Spanish phenotype may not carry the expected Iberian blood markers. Conversely, some horses that lack Spanish type, such as certain strains of the American Quarter Horse, may have blood markers but not the proper phenotype. Colonial Spanish horses include numerous strains, which may be feral populations or standardized breeds: *Abaco Barb (extinct since 2015) *Banker horse (eastern US; Corolla and Shackleford Islands) *Carolina Marsh Tacky *Florida Cracker Horse *Baca-Chica *Belsky horse *Havapai (Grand Canyon Strain) *Spanish Mustang. *Santa-Cruz Island Horses *Wilbur-Cruce Mission horse * Populations of mustangs considered to be Colonial Spanish strains: **Kiger mustang **Pryor Mountain mustang **Sulphur Springs mustang **Cerbat mustang *Tribal Horses **Chickasaw horse **Choctaw horse *Chincoteague pony (Assateague horse) – dubious, but widely asserted *Gila Bend mustang A number of breeds in Latin America with Iberian DNA markers are of Spanish type and origin. Many of these breeds come from different North American foundation bloodstock, and some have haplotypes not found in North America.

Career Scally had become wealthy through the sale of his Metronote photocopier business in South London prior to buying sole control of Gillingham F.C. for the sum of £1 in 1995, taking the club out of administration shortly before they would have been placed into liquidation. His tenure has witnessed probably the most successful period in the club's history, with three promotions, three Wembley play-off finals and four FA Cup victories over top division opponents, and their highest league finish of 11th in the Championship. He has also overseen the radical redevelopment of the club's Priestfield Stadium, with three new permanent stands and one temporary one transforming it into an all-seater arena, together with other non- footballing facilities such as a banqueting suite. However the club's fortunes both on and off the pitch took a downhill turn from about 2004, arising mainly from his overspending on the new stands and facilities, and also the loss of anticipated income following the collapse of ITV Digital. Scally is the sole owner of Priestfield Developments Ltd., a company formed in 2007 with the sole purpose of purchasing Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium for £9.8m as part of the restructuring of the club's debts. Controversy Scally has a reputation for often taking controversial positions. For example, he has made no secret of his desire to relocate the club from the town of Gillingham, possibly to a location away from the Medway Towns though still somewhere within the county of Kent, claiming \\"The future of this football club is not at this stadium and everyone, if they are not stupid, accepts that is a fundamental point.\\" He summarily dismissed manager Tony Pulis immediately after he had led the team to a Wembley play-off final in 1999, which brought about a protracted legal dispute over Pulis' contract. He has also become involved in a number of public disputes, most notably with several other Football League clubs over player transfers, the Kent Messenger Group of local newspapers (whose reporters he banned from the ground for several years for supposedly criticising poor team performances), and Alan Liptrott, then chairman of the Gills Independent Supporters Club, with whom he had several public disagreements, the largest over the ownership of an internet domain name, which led to Scally imposing a lifetime ban from Priestfield on Liptrott. However, on 8 February 2007, Scally unexpectedly rescinded the ban after approximately six years. Personal life As of 2009, Scally is non-resident in the UK for tax purposes, and resides in Dubai. He has been married three times and has had seven children. One of his sons died after a fall at the age of one, and another of a heart defect in 2003 at the age of 16 weeks. His surviving children comprise two daughters and three sons. His son Max (born 29 January 1991) was imprisoned for two years in January 2009 having been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to a 15 year old boy. His other sons are Jay and Adam, the latter of whom has been employed by the club as editor of Gillingham's matchday programme.

He was killed in the second armed confrontation. He was spurred on by racism he allegedly encountered while enlisted in the Navy. He was also a one-time Black Panther. Background Mark James Robert Essex was born in Emporia, Kansas. He graduated from Emporia Senior High School in 1967, and attended Emporia State University, where he dropped out after one semester. Essex joined the United States Navy as a dental technician in 1969, stationed in San Diego, California, where he claimed he was subjected to two years of ceaseless racial abuse from whites.Cawthorne, Nigel & Geoff Tibballs.

By late 1972 he was living in New Orleans, Louisiana but did not join a local chapter of the Panthers. He trained in vending machine repair. In November 1972, he was disturbed and outraged by the harsh response of Baton Rouge, Louisiana police to student civil rights demonstrations at Southern University, a historically black university, which resulted in the deaths of two black students shot by police. Shootings =New Year's Eve, 1972= At the age of 23 and living in New Orleans, Essex began targeting white policemen for death, as he intended to retaliate for police brutality against African Americans and the discrimination he encountered in the Navy. On New Year's Eve 1972, Essex parked his car and walked along Perdido Street, a block from the New Orleans Police Department. He hid in a parking lot across from the busy central lockup and fatally shot 19-year-old Cadet Alfred Harrell. He also wounded Lt. Horace Perez in the attack. Harrell was black; before beginning his attacks, Essex had earlier claimed he was going to kill \\"just honkies.\\"McConnaughey, Janet. \\"New Orleans 1973: Textbook example of how not to stop a serial sniper\\", Arizona Daily Sun, January 4, 2003; retrieved January 30, 2016. He used a 5-shot Ruger Model 44 .44-caliber semi-automatic carbine. Essex evaded capture by jumping a chain link fence and running across I-10, while setting off firecrackers as a diversion. He ran into Gert Town, an area known for high crime and hostility towards police. There he broke into the Burkart building, a warehouse and manufacturing plant on the corner of Euphrosine and South Gayoso. He set off an alarm that alerted police to this break-in. A K-9 unit led by Officers Edwin Hosli Sr. and Harold Blappert responded to the call, but they did not realize it was connected to the attack on central lockup.Mass Murderers. . 89-102. As Officer Hosli began to get his German shepherd out of the car's back seat, Essex shot him in the back. Essex started shooting the car, shattering the windshield. Officer Blappert reached the radio from the front seat and called for back-up. Blappert fired four shots at the spot where he saw muzzle flashes from Essex's rifle, then he pulled his partner onto the front seat and waited for back-up. When the back- up arrived, they sent two dogs into the building to search for Essex, but he had already escaped. Officer Hosli died of his injuries on March 5, 1973. The former New Orleans Howard Johnson's downtown hotel, where Essex took part in a gun battle with police. It is now a Holiday Inn hotel, photo from 2008. =January 7, 1973= At 10:15 a.m. on January 7, 1973, Essex shot a local grocer named Joe Perniciaro with his .44 Magnum carbine. He carjacked Marvin Albert as he sat in his 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle outside his house on South White Street. Essex drove Albert's stolen vehicle to the downtown Howard Johnson's Hotel at 330 Loyola Avenue in New Orleans' Central Business District, across the street from City Hall and Orleans Parish Civil District Court. He parked and climbed the stairs from the garage, but found that the fire doors were locked on floor after floor. Gaining entry from a fire stairwell on the 18th and top floor, Essex startled three African-American employees of the hotel. Essex said to one of them, a chambermaid, \\"Don't worry, sister. We're only shooting whites today.\\" The employees quickly notified authorities. In the hallway by room 1829, Essex encountered Dr. Robert Steagall and his wife Betty, a couple from Virginia on a honeymoon, and forced them into their room. After a struggle with Dr. Steagall, Essex fatally shot him in the chest and shot Betty in the back of the head. The Steagalls both died of their injuries. In their room, he soaked telephone books with lighter fluid and set them ablaze under the curtains. Essex dropped a Pan- African flag onto the floor beside the bodies of the couple as he left. On the 11th floor, Essex shot his way into several rooms and set more fires. There he also shot and killed Frank Schneider, the hotel's assistant manager, and fatally shot Walter Collins, the hotel's general manager. Collins died in the hospital three weeks later as a result of his gunshot wounds. The police and fire department quickly arrived. Two officers tried to use a fire truck's ladder to enter the building, but were shot at by Essex, who had returned to the 18th floor. A few minutes later, Essex shot and killed NOPD Officers Phillip Coleman and Paul Persigo on the ground. Times-Picayune photographer G.E. Arnold took an iconic photo as Coleman died of a head wound in Duncan Plaza. Arnold also captured a shot of a wounded Eighth District NOPD officer, Ken Solis, shot in the shoulder and leaning against a tree as another officer, Dave McCann, was trying to stop the bleeding, all while other police and bystanders took cover. Essex fatally shot Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo in the spine as he tried to rescue trapped officers. Lt. Lewis Townsend, a Tulane University medical student, walked into the open field and carried Sirgo out of the line of fire, then returned to class. Seeing TV coverage, Lt. Colonel (later Lt. General) Charles H. Pitman, a pilot in the United States Marine Corps, without obtaining prior clearance, took off in a CH-46 military helicopter to assist the police officers. Pitman landed the helicopter near the hotel, taking on armed officers and flew over the hotel. By this time, Essex had retreated to the roof of the building, from where he and men in the helicopter exchanged many rounds over many hours. As nightfall came, Essex found cover in a concrete cubicle on the southeast side of the roof. As he stepped out in the open to fire again on the helicopter, and after hitting the helicopter's transmission, Essex was fatally shot numerous times by police sharpshooters positioned on the roofs of adjacent buildings, as well as the automatic weapons aboard the helicopter. An autopsy later revealed he had more than 200 gunshot wounds.

A member of the minor gentry, his family was connected to Sir Arthur Haselrig, one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest by Charles I in January 1642 sparked the First English Civil War. Horton served throughout the war, and in 1645 was given command of a regiment in the New Model Army. During the 1648 Second English Civil War, he played a significant role in ending the revolt in South Wales, and was rewarded with grants of land in Pembrokeshire. He was appointed as a judge at the trial of Charles I in January 1649, and was one of 51 who signed the death warrant. In August 1649, his regiment was selected for service in Ireland; he died of disease at Wexford in October, and has no known grave. Biography Horton's patron, Arthur Haselrig Thomas Horton was born in Gumley, Leicestershire, second son of William Horton (1576-1638) and Isabell Freeman (died after 1649). In 1608, William purchased lands in Gumley, and thus ranked as a member of the minor gentry. Thomas was one of eight surviving children, including his elder brother John (died before 1664), James, Andrew (died after 1662), Robert (died before 1649), William (1613-after 1651), Elizabeth and Mary. Based on legal documents, with the exception of Robert, all were still alive in 1649, but there are few other details available. In 1645, he married the daughter of John and Margaret St Loe; she presumably died soon after, as unlike her parents, she is not mentioned in his will, who are named as guardians of his son Thomas. It is suggested this is the Thomas Horton who emigrated to Milton, Massachusetts, and died in Rehoboth, Massachusetts in 1710. Career Little is known of Horton's career prior to 1642, except for the fact he was connected to the local magnate, Sir Arthur Haselrig. It is often suggested he served him as a falconer, but documents relating to property transactions confirm his status as a minor landowner. Along with Oliver Cromwell, John Pym, and other prominent Puritans, Haselrig was associated with the Saybrook Colony, established in what is now Connecticut. Based on Thomas' 1649 will, it appears Horton advanced his youngest brother William £50 to emigrate there in 1635. =The First English Civil War= One of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 led to the First English Civil War, Haselrig raised a regiment when war began in August. Known as the 'London Lobsters', due to their distinctive armour, Horton was commissioned into this regiment as a cornet, and fought at Edgehill in October 1642. Promoted captain-lieutenant in 1643, he served in William Waller's army throughout 1643 and 1644, including the major battles of Lansdowne, Roundway Down, Cheriton, and Second Newbury. When the New Model Army was formed in 1645, Haselrig's unit became Colonel John Butler's Regiment of Horse, with Horton as his deputy. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Naseby in June, but returned to serve in the 1645-1646 Western Campaign, including the battles of Langport and Torrington. The war ended in June 1646, with the surrender of Oxford. =Second English Civil War= Map of 17th-century Wexford, showing Cromwell's camp to the southwest; Horton died here on or around 15 October 1649 Arguments over the settlement with Charles led to internal conflict between Parliamentarian moderates, mostly socially conservative Presbyterians, and radicals, many of whom were religious Independents. This included Baptists, a sect that was particularly prominent in the New Model; both Horton and his close friend, Colonel John Phillips, were members of a Baptist congregation established in Cardiff in 1649. The economic cost of the war, a poor 1646 harvest, and recurrence of the plague meant Parliament could not meet all of its obligations. One reason the New Model favoured the radicals was because they supported full payment of their wage arrears, which by March 1647 had reached the then enormous sum of £3 million. Horton signed his regiment's 'Petition of Grievances' in May, and after Butler resigned in June, replaced him as Colonel. The relationship between Parliament and the Army Council continued to deteriorate, leading to the eviction of the Eleven Members in July, and the occupation of London by the New Model. Another area of concern was Wales, then held by the Western Association army, under John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne, who supported the Parliamentarian moderates. By early 1647, there were considerable doubts over their reliability. From 1642 to 1646, most of the area had been Royalist, while Harlech Castle only surrendered in March 1647. Concerns over its security increased when secret messages between Charles and the Irish Confederacy were intercepted, since Cardiff and Milford Haven could be used to transfer troops from Confederacy ports like Wexford. At the end of July 1647, Horton and a small New Model detachment was sent to South Wales, to monitor the situation. By March 1648, Poyer's troops had not been paid for eighteen months, and he refused to hand over Pembroke Castle until their arrears had been settled. As Horton reported to London, the local populace were also furious at having to pay taxes to support an unwanted army in their area. What began as a wage dispute led to open revolt in April, when Poyer, Laugharne and Rice Powell declared their support for restoring Charles, beginning the Second English Civil War. They assembled an army of around 8,000, hoping to destroy Horton's smaller force of 3,000 before he could be reinforced by Cromwell. In contrast to Horton's experienced veterans, most of the Royalist troops were untrained and poorly armed; he won an easy victory at St Fagans on 8 May. Shortly after this victory, Cromwell arrived in Wales with another 6,500 men, and besieged Pembroke Castle; after capturing Tenby, Horton joined him there at the end of May. The siege was delayed by a month while they waited for the artillery train to arrive; once it did, Poyer surrendered soon after, on 11 July. =The War in Ireland= In 1645, Laugharne had been rewarded for his service with lands confiscated from a Welsh Royalist, John Barlow of Slebech; these were now given to Horton and Phillips, along with several others. The two were also put in charge of collecting a fine of £20,000, levied on Welsh Royalists. In January 1649, Horton was appointed to the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I, and signed the warrant for his execution. Shortly after this, he was appointed Commissioner for South Wales, but in July, his regiment was one of those chosen to fight in Ireland. He landed in Dublin in September, and took part in the siege of Wexford, from 2 to 11 October. In a letter dated 25 October, Cromwell wrote Horton 'is lately dead of the country-disease', usually thought to refer to dysentery, a common disease caused by poor hygiene. His grave has since been lost. In 1654, Parliament approved a payment to his executors of £1,454 in back pay; as a regicide, his heirs were deprived of their estate at the 1660 Restoration, although this could not have been substantial, while it seems likely his son had already emigrated.

Since the 2004 release of their self-titled EP, the project has been on an indefinite hold.  History  According to a Metal Hammer article on the band; \\"Error came about when Atticus realised his cocking about in the studio had produced something along the lines of actual songs.\\" Atticus recruited his younger brother Leopold Ross to play drums and Bad Religion member and Epitaph Records owner Brett Gurewitz to play guitar and bass. Dillinger Escape Plan frontman Greg Puciato was also recruited to perform vocals on the band's first release, but he is only considered to be a temporary member. The band released its first record, a self-titled EP, in 2004. The EP features The Locust's keyboardist Joey Karam playing a Moog synthesizer on the track \\"Jack The Ripper\\". Prior to the EP's release, Error released a remix of the Transplants' song on Punk-O-Rama 8 in 2003 entitled \\"Quick Death (Error Remix)\\". Error was reported to be looking for a full-time vocalist for touring and for an upcoming album, however the future of the band has been a topic for discussion on many internet message boards. No further news has been released on the status of the new album, however as the first EP was created with virtually no outside knowledge, the album may be similarly produced behind closed doors. Around 2005, Error recorded a new song, titled \\"Wild World\\", that appears on a tribute album to The Birthday Party called Release the Bats: The Birthday Party as Heard Through the Meat Grinder of Three One G, which was released on April 4, 2006. The song is available on iTunes. Leo Ross is the vocalist on this release, the track was also mixed by Atticus's long-time engineer Doug Trantow. As of 2009, it is unlikely that Error will return anytime in the future. Gurewitz has continued touring and making records with Bad Religion and the Ross brothers have been busy with their own projects. However, in a 2011 interview with Greg Puciato, he discussed the possibility of doing a second EP with Error, Puciato later contradicted this statement, confirming in 2012 that Error is \\"dead as of now\\".

Synchronous transmissions are synchronized by an external clock, while asynchronous transmissions are synchronized by special signals along the transmission medium. The need for synchronization Whenever an electronic device transmits digital (and sometimes analogue) data to another, there must be a certain rhythm established between the two devices, i.e., the receiving device must have some way of, within the context of the fluctuating signal that it's receiving, determining where each unit of data begins and where it ends. Methods of synchronization There are two ways to synchronize the two ends of the communication. The synchronous signalling methods use two different signals. A pulse on one signal indicates when another bit of information is ready on the other signal. The asynchronous signalling methods use only one signal. The receiver uses transitions on that signal to figure out the transmitter bit rate (\\"autobaud\\") and timing, and set a local clock to the proper timing, typically using a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with the transmission rate. A pulse from the local clock indicates when another bit is ready. =Synchronous transmission= In synchronous communications, the stream of data to be transferred is encoded as fluctuating voltage levels in one wire (the 'DATA'), and a periodic pulse of voltage on a separate wire (called the \\"CLOCK\\" or \\"STROBE\\") which tells the receiver \\"the current DATA bit is 'valid' at this moment in time\\". Practically all parallel communications protocols use synchronous transmission. For example, in a computer, address information is transmitted synchronously—the address bits over the address bus, and the read or write strobes of the control bus. Single-wire synchronous signalling A logical one is indicated when there are two transitions in the same time frame as a zero. In the Manchester coding a transition from low to high indicates a one and a transition from high to low indicates a zero. When there are successive ones or zeros, an opposite transition is required on the edge of the time frame to prepare for the next transition and signal. =Asynchronous transmission= The most common asynchronous signalling, asynchronous start-stop signalling, uses a near-constant 'bit' timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required at both ends of the connection). Using this method, the receiver detects the 'first' edge transition... (the START bit), waits 'half a bit duration' and then reads the value of the signal. A further delay of one 'whole bit duration' is executed before the next data bit is 'read' - repeating for the length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits). An optional PARITY bit follows the data bits and precedes the stop bit(s). Finally, one or more STOP bits are appended to identify the end of the data word and to make sure there is a bit transition when the next START bit is transmitted. The word structure used in typical asynchronous serial communications is START- DATA[0:7]-PARITY[optional;0]-STOP[0:1]. These formatting variables are specified when configuring the transmit and receive nodes before communications take place. The bit duration is determined from the nominated 'bit rate' in bps... 300, 1200, 9600, 19200, 115200 etc. The use of the word BAUD is not strictly correct in the modern application of serial channels. Special level & timing conditions are detected to identify an open-circuit condition (BREAK).

The basic educational principle of the school is that a child is not preparing for life but is living it. The school has given up the traditional instruments of institutional regulation, including house rules, systems of punishment and reward. These have been replaced with the free flow of information and the freedom of choice, emphasising the individual personalities of students, and taking into account their personal needs and concerns. The nature of this freedom changes along with the different stages of the students' life in the school.  Address  AKG can be found at 1035, Raktár utca 1.  History  AKG has the distinction of being the first non- state school in Hungary (established in 1988). Hungary had no private education since the collectivization that followed the second World War. It was established as an independent teachers' workshop. Its founders and organizers were all practicing educators, who created and developed the curriculum over two years.  Educational system  In Hungary, students typically apply to a high school in either 6th or 8th grade. Hungarian students in public education are in high school for 6 and 4 years respectively, depending on when they started, with everybody graduating in 12th grade. AKG has 7-year and 5-year programs available for students, due to the language year, delaying graduation by a year. = Years 7-10 = The purpose of this period is to provide students with basic education in a wide variety of subjects, to ensure literacy and familiarity in any field they may go into later. Classes are organized into epochs with the epoch-system. Briefly summarized, the epoch system allows students to focus on specific subjects for extended periods of time. Students have two epoch classes every day, with each lasting 80 minutes. Each class \\"slot\\" has a dedicated subject. Epochs are cyclical, with small tests every week and epoch-ending tests after three weeks. Traditionally, there are no pop-quizzes in this system. Epoch slots shift after every end of unit test. For example, a student could have a mathematics and a history epoch. Every Monday, they would write a test in these subjects. After three weeks, they would write the end of unit test and move on to literature and science epochs. Once those are done, they go back to mathematics and history, until the school year ends. A year has 5 epoch cycles. Critical to AKG is the \\"patronal system\\", which runs parallel to the epoch system. The largest unit of community in AKG is the school year, comprised of individuals who started in the same year. \\"Years\\" are divided into \\"stacks\\", which learn epochs together. A stack is roughly 30 people, with a year being made of 2-3 stacks. Student's of AKG pick the name of their community, so they aren't categorized into sterile, alpha-numerical systems. The name of a year is comprised of the names of it's stacks. For example, year \\"King-Kong\\" would have stacks named King and Kong, and a year named \\"Veni- Vidi-Vici\\" would have stacks named Veni, Vidi and Vici. Stacks are further subdivided into patronal groups. Patrons are (usually) the individuals who teach epochs to the students. PGs are the smallest unit of community in AKG, being designed as ready-made communities for students in the first few years, but they usually give way to organically formed friend-circles and lose relevance over time. Students are mandated to pick at least on extra curricular activity every year during this period. School doesn't start immediately with classes, instead, there is an opening activity every day. The activity is decided upon the patrons of that Year. This acts as a buffer zone between classes and home life, so students don't just drop into a busy environment. This can be discussing important world news, upcoming school events, playing a game, or anything else that engages the students but isn't related to the curriculum. = Year 11/language = During this year, students learn a third language. During the previous years, all students typically reach at least mid-level competency in English. In this year, they have to drop English and learn a new language. German, Spanish, or French are the usual choices. Students are given the option to organize additional languages themselves but this is rare. The goal of this year is for students to achieve at least B2 level competency in their language of choice. They spend 18 hours every week learning with a native speaker. Education is closely tied to the culture of the language's nation, and so this doubles as cultural education as well. Students also have two media-studies classes every week and physical education. Extra curricular activities are available but not mandatory. School days are relatively short this year to let students work on their year-long- project and to explore what interests them, because next year they have to pick a subject to specialize in. = Years 11-12 = In the final period, AKG shifts back to traditional 45 minute classes, because there is no time for the deep engagement of epochs, as the students are working on their \\"maturity exam\\", the points of which are used when applying to higher education at home and abroad. Students pick a subject they would like to specialize in, and are sorted into classes based on the level they want to pursue it on (All subjects can be basic, middle, or advanced. Students don't bother with basic training because it is essentially worthless, middle is the common choice with advanced being chosen by ambitious students applying to schools abroad. The difficulty correlates with the amount of material students have to learn. This is the same across all of Hungary.). Stacks stop existing, as students are now sorted into specializations, not arbitrary groups.  Notable students  * Daniel Varró (poet) * Judith Damásdi (linguist) * Juli Jacob (screenwriter) * Ivan Szabó (director, screenwriter) * Gerzson Nyárai (editor, tv host) * Dorka Kászonyi (fashion marketing expert) * Zsuzsa Elek (lawyer) * Dr. Gabriel Garai (child surgeon) * Dávid Turczi (IT-engineer) * Dr. Robert Csák(sociologist) * Gabriel Nagy (marketing specialist) * Mirkó Papp (system architect) * Peter Szalai (journalist) * Andrew Tömpe (programer) * Daniel Varga (preventive expert)  Projects  In AKG, students take part in a variety of subjects over the years. In the first few years, students work on short term projects that last 1-3 weeks, either alone or in groups. This can be anything from assembling a poetry collection to creating a model of a scientist's laboratory. Additionally, students must work on two year long projects. The first, the \\"Family History\\", is done over the course of the entirety of the 10th grade. Students must perform original research, assemble materials (such as letters and photographs) and create an in depth documentation of the history of their family in the 20th century. The second year long project, during the language year, is freely chosen by the students (but approved by the patrons). It is usually some sort of synthetic activity, with an end result, although this is not always the case. Students also have to pick a mentor who is an expert and can help them with their project. For example, if a student is writing music as a project, their mentor could be their music teacher. Family and friends are usually not allowed to be mentors, to ensure that they don't do the project instead of the student. The students receive a grade for this work, and must meet certain standards to pass and move on to the 11th grade. Although the presentation of the project and the work itself are important in the grading, the most valued component is the documentation of the student's work, because the point of the project is to get students used to working on long time scales, not just a few weeks at a time.  Extracurricular activities  AKG offers it's students a wide variety of extracurricular activities. They can be graded or non-graded. Once a student picks one, they have to do it for the whole year. An extracurricular activity can only begin if at least 8 people apply. If at least 8 people come together with an activity they would like to do, the school assists them with organizing it and finding a teacher Student's in AKG can partake in the following extracurricular activities, among many others: hosting a radio show which is broadcast across the school, taking part in drama clubs themed around world cultures, video and photo clubs, writing for the school newspaper. Students can also join clubs themed around things they like studying or would like to study later, like marketing, biology, physics, mathematics, etc. Students can also get experience working with lab equipment in the laboratory club, or with basic medicine in the first aid club. AKG has a robotics club, renowned in Hungary for it's great success in many competitions. It deals with designing, building and programming robots using Lego Mindstorms sets, as well as 3D design and printing. Currently, the club is mentored by Gergely Nádori and Judit Pásztor. Students who have been in the club for at least a year can go to the First Lego League. Students can also work with more advanced robotics platforms, such as Arduino, ESP, Micro:Bit and Lego EV3.  Theme- week  In AKG, a theme week is a whole week of school in which students have no classes and each year has one specific theme based on which they create projects. All years have their theme week at the same time. AKG has 5 theme weeks every year. One at the start of the school year, one a week before winter break, two during spring, and one in June. Three of them are held within the school, two of them are held outside of the school. There are recurring themes, such as the science-themed natural excursions, and some are one time, such as visiting a rural village.  Little-epochs  Little-epochs are short, but important, topics that don't warrant an entire theme-week. This can be something like first aid, or how to study effectively. Little epochs replace one of the epoch slots for a week, and on average occur every 5 weeks.  Structure of social spaces  Physically, AKG can be interpreted as a sum of many \\"little schools\\". A LS is a self contained social space with a classroom for each stack, a kitchen, a central social area, bathrooms and a teacher's lounge. Students are allowed to make the space their own with changes and decorations, but the physical integrity and cleanliness of the space must be maintained. Students leave the LS for things like clubs and classes that require special equipment (music, P.E., science, etc.) but they spend the vast majority of their days here. Whenever a year graduates, their LS is renovated, to make way for the next year coming in September.  School traditions  = Sleep over = Students in AKG frequently have in-school sleepovers, either with their patronal group or their club. During the night, the school is almost completely empty, and students can do whatever they want (within reason, of course). Common favorites are playing hide and seek in the labyrinthine halls, watching movies, or playing dodgeball. One teacher has to be in the building with the students for supervisory purposes. Students bring their own sleeping bags, and sleep on lobby-couches, or gym mats. The robotics team frequently does sleep-ins before competitions for additional crunch time, so much so that a running joke amongst students is that the robotics team lives in the building and never leaves. = Patron picking = First year students have a special introductory camp, the purpose of which is to let them get to know the other students and the patrons. At the end of the camp, students rank the patrons on a scale, according to how much they want to be their student. On the last night, the patrons are up all night sorting people into patronal groups. On the final morning, students learn of their patronal group for the next few years during a ceremony, which is usually designed by the patrons. Once the groups are made, the eat breakfast together to get to know each other even better. = Science Night = Science Night is a 4-5 hour program in October, completely open to the public. Guests can get to know various fields of science, experiments, and the lives of important intellectuals. Activities are organized either by relevant clubs, or vetted outsiders. Anything from electronics to chemistry can be found on Science Night. There are several comforts offered to guests, such as a room-sized wardrobe for coats and a snack shop run by students. The event's primary function is marketing and PR for AKG. = Christmas in AKG = A theme-week precedes Christmas every year, but years themselves organize gifting events according to the desires of students. \\"Secret Santa\\" is popular with young students, but the older members of AKG prefer less scripted holidays and usually don't bother with gifting  Response to the coronavirus crisis  AKG has been transitioning to digital education for many years, so the switch to long-distance schooling in March of 2020 was easier than for most but not without hurdles. In September, special protocols were developed to ensure that as much time could be spent in school as possible, while also containing infections locally. The central idea is that one year is one self-contained community, and contact between years must be minimized and eliminated wherever possible. The protocols are as follows: * Vertically integrated extracurricular activities have been disbanded for the foreseeable future. * If a student receives a positive test result, their year goes into quarantine for two weeks (counting from when the test was performed). Students take part in digital education for the duration of their isolation. * The school cafeteria is closed. Meals from the kitchen are delivered directly to years in crates, and the snack shop has time slots for each year. * Students may not leave and enter the building freely once their classes have started. They can leave permanently for something like a dentist appointment, or wait until their classes are over to go shopping. * Students must wear masks during classes, but not in social spaces. Masks may be taken off for eating and drinking. (These protocols are current as of October 2020)  Notes  https://www2.akg.hu/program/1998/prg1.html External links *http://www.akg.hu/ *http://www.akg.hu/english Gymnasiums in Hungary Private schools Budapest Alternative education NOEDITSECTION INDEX NONEWSECTIONLINK ","title":"Alternatív Közgazdasági Gimnázium"},{"id":"1206186","text":"Van Jacobson in January 2006 Van Jacobson (born 1950) is an American computer scientist, renowned for his work on TCP/IP network performance and scaling.2001 SIGCOMM Award for Lifetime Achievement to Van Jacobson \\"for contributions to protocol architecture and congestion control.\\" He is one of the primary contributors to the TCP/IP protocol stack—the technological foundation of today’s Internet.\\"Van Jacobson Biography\\", IEEE Global History Network, accessed 31 March 2012 Since 2013, Jacobson is an adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) working on Named Data Networking.

It allows musicians and sound specialists design and build their own instruments, samplers, effects and sound design tools. It is supplied with many ready-to-use instruments and effects, from emulations of classic synthesizers to futuristic sound design tools. In addition, more than 3000 free instruments can be downloaded from the growing User Library. One of Reaktor's unique selling points is that all of its instruments can be freely examined, customized or taken apart; Reaktor is a tool that effectively encourages reverse engineering. Reaktor Player is a free limited version of the software that allows musicians to play NI-released Reaktor instruments, but not edit or reverse-engineer them. Development History =Early development= In 1996, Native Instruments released Generator version 0.96 - a modular synthesizer for PC, requiring a proprietary audio card for low-latency operation. By 1998, Native Instruments redesigned the program to include new hierarchy, and integrated third-party drivers for use with any standard Windows sound card. By 1999, Reaktor 2.0 (a.k.a. Generator/Transformator) was released for Windows and Macintosh. Integrated real-time display of filters and envelopes and granular synthesis are among most notable features. Plug-in support for VST, VSTi, DirectConnect, MOTU, and DirectX formats is integrated by 2000 (software version 2.3). With version 3.0 (released in 2001), Native Instruments introduced a redesigned audio engine and new graphic design. Further expansion of synthesis and sampling modules, addition of new control- based modules (XY control) and data management (event tables) greatly expands the abilities of the program. The earliest version to really resemble the modern incarnation of the software is version 3.5, which improved greatly in VST performance and sample handling. Reaktor 3.5 is the first release that features full cross-platform compatibility. Reaktor 4 was a major enhancement in terms of stability, instrument library, GUI, and VSTi ease-of-use in external sequencers. It shipped almost six months behind schedule. =Version 5= In 2003 Native Instruments hired Vadim Zavalishin, developer of the Sync Modular software package. Zavalishin ceased the development of his software, yet integrated a deeper DSP-level operation within Reaktor, known as Reaktor Core Technology. His contributions, along with those of Reaktor Core developer Martijn Zwartjes, were released within Reaktor 5 in April 2005. Core Technology initially confused a lot of instrument designers because of its complexity, but is now steadily making its way into new instruments and ensembles. Reaktor 5.1, released on 22 December 2005, and presented as a Christmas present, features new Core Cell modules, and a new series of FX and ensembles. Also a number of bug fixes were implemented. The release of Reaktor 5.5 was announced for 1 September 2010. It features a revised interface as well as other changes. =Version 6= Reaktor 6.0 was released on September 9, 2015. It features many new improvements for advanced programmers. A new \\"Blocks\\" feature allowed for the development of rackmount style modular \\"patches\\" for creating synthesizers and effects.https://www.native- instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/reaktor-6/ Functionality From the end-user standpoint, Reaktor is a sound creation/manipulation tool with a modular interface. Its patches consist of modules, connected by lines to provide a visual interpretation of signal flow. The building blocks used give Reaktor users freedom of choice to help shape their sound design. The modules are categorized into particular hierarchy to aid clarity in patching. The patcher window allows one to navigate the inner structure of user's models. Many factory-shipped objects within Reaktor can be accessed and edited, and new objects can be generated on the fly. Each of the Reaktor modules is defined by its inner workings, and expansion thereof to the users' specification comes with relative ease. The objects that are available within Reaktor range from simple math operators to large sound modules. Implementation of Core Technology with version 5 enables user to view and edit the structure of any \\"Core Module\\" building block. Although such editing can be an exceptionally powerful tool, successful manipulation of Core Cells with predictable results requires in-depth knowledge of algorithmic implementation of signal generation and processing. Native Instruments promote this functionality with online side-by-side comparison of Core implementation of simple DSP algorithm against C++ pseudocode.http://co.native- instruments.com/index.php?id=r5core1http://co.native- instruments.com/index.php?id=r5core2 Reaktor enables a user to implement variables (static or dynamic) which are used as defining properties of the patch. Users have an ability to generate a GUI of their own to provide dynamic control to their systems. Starting with version 4, Reaktor supports user- generated graphical content, enabling many users to generate original look and feel of their instruments. A finished Reaktor ensemble may be loaded into a host sequencer (such as Steinberg Cubase or Ableton Live), and used as a stand-alone software plug-in for audio generation or processing (a multi- format proprietary loader is included with the software). Each panel control in the ensemble is capable of MIDI automation in the host sequencer. Reaktor Ensembles The Reaktor Library is one of the prominent features of the software, featuring a large variety of sound generators and effects that can be used as stand-alone instruments, or as an educational resource for reverse engineering. Reaktor 4 featured a library of 31 Reaktor ensembles. The fifth generation of software came with 32 new modules (though some were upgrades of Reaktor 4 Library tools). The libraries provide a mixture of conventional implementation of software synthesizers, samplers, and effects, along with a few ensembles of experimental nature, with emphasis on parametric algorithmic composition and extensive sound processing. Due to complete backwards- compatibility between later versions of the software, Reaktor 5 users have access to all 63 proprietary ensembles in Reaktor Library. Furthermore, home- brew Reaktor ensembles can be shared by its users. Such exchange is encouraged by Native Instruments, characterized by the company's dedication for providing web-based tools and webspace for individual and third-party Reaktor extensions (this includes user Ensembles and presets for Reaktor Instruments and Effects). =Reaktor 4 Library= Synthesizers * Carbon * Green Matrix * Junatik * Kaleidon * Nanowave * P-Bass * Steampipe * Sum Synth * Uranus Sequencers * Blue Matrix * DSQ-32 Drummachine * Vierring * WaveWeaver Samplers * Grainstates SP * Travelizer * Beat Slicer * Memory Drum Live * GoBox * Scenario Effects * Space Master Stereo * Space Master Quadro * Space Master 5.1 Surround * Banaan Electric * Analogic Filter Box * Echomania * Spring Tank * Classic Vocoder * Fusion Reflections * Grainstates FX * Two Knees Compressor * Flatblaster Reaktor 5 Library =Synthesizers= * 2-Osc * Carbon 2 * Equinoxe Deluxe * Form * FM4 * FM4 Dual * Gaugear * Lazerbass * Monark * Oki Computer 2 * Steampipe 2 * Subharmonic * Super 8 =Grooveboxes= * Aerobic * Massive * Newscool * Sinebeats 2 =Algorithmic= * Skrewell * Spacedrone =Samplers= * L3 * Random Step Shifter * Splitter * Vectory * Ands, Glex * Beatslicer 2 * Memory Drum 2 =Sequencers= * SQP * SQ16 * SQ 8x8 * SQ8 * Snapper * SQx * Spiral =Effects= * Flatblaster 2 * Space Master 2 * Lurker See also * Comparison of audio synthesis environments * List of music software References  External links  *Reaktor 6 homepage Native Instruments Software synthesizers Visual programming languages ","title":"Reaktor"},{"id":"1206200","text":"Teitur () is a male given name.

Ellison was nicknamed \\"Never Nervous Pervis\\" for his play with the University of Louisville. At 6 ft 9 in and 242 lb, he started all four years as the center under coach Denny Crum. In his freshman year he led Louisville to its second national championship and was named the Most Outstanding Player--the second time a freshman had ever been awarded that honor, after Arnie Ferrin in 1944 for Utah. Ellison was made the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. Teammate Danny Ainge gave Ellison the nickname \\"Out of Service Pervis\\" for the many injuries that would plague him during his professional career. An injury kept him on the sidelines for 48 of 82 games of his rookie year, after which he was traded to the Washington Bullets in a three-team trade involving the Utah Jazz that also sent Jeff Malone to the Jazz and Eric Leckner, Bob Hansen, and draft picks to the Kings. Although he was assigned as a backup in 1990–1991, the following year he became a starter and earned Most Improved Player honors after averaging 20.0 points, 11.4 rebounds and 2.68 blocks per game. Arguably the best game of Ellison's NBA career occurred on January 31, 1992, when he recorded 19 points, 19 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 blocked shots and 2 steals against the Knicks. Assorted injuries plagued his career, including two knee problems that kept him benched for 29 games in 1992-1993 and 30 games in 1993-1994. As a free agent, Ellison signed with the Boston Celtics in 1994 but did not play until midway through the season because he was still rehabilitating from knee problems. A broken toe suffered while moving furniture kept him out of most games between 1996 and 1998. After participating in 69 out of a possible 246 games over the final three seasons with the Celtics, he joined the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000 but retired after playing nine games.

He was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and educated at Redcliffe School and Colston School in Bristol. His first job was with Western Daily Press and Allied Newspapers in Bristol started in 1905. This lasted until 1911 when he left to become a special writer on the staff of Edward Hulton and Co. in Manchester. He moved to London to work on the Daily Mail and Daily Citizen in Fleet Street, although he also worked in the propaganda section of Air Intelligence towards the end of the First World War. When it ended he joined the editorial staff of George Newnes as a sub editor of the John O'London's Weekly. He didn't see eye to eye with the editor and after a big row in 1919 his employment was terminated. He decided to become a full-time writer. He became a popular author with the publication, in 1925, of his first crime novel, The Mystery of No.1, and with novels such as Checkmate (1930). Horler's work was influenced by other popular thriller writers such as Edgar Wallace and \\"Sapper\\". His main hero was \\"Tiger\\" Standish, a character similar to Sapper's Bulldog Drummond.Marvin Lachman, \\"Horler, Sydney\\" in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers, edited by James Vinson and D.L. Kirkpatrick. (p.474-77). Horler's work began to be commercially successful after being serialised in the News of the World. By the 1930s, Horler's books had sold an estimated two million copies.Turnbull, Malcolm J. Victims or villains: Jewish images in classic English detective fiction. Popular Press, 1998 (p. 62-4, 118–9) Political views Horler frequently used his work to put forward his opinions. He was a supporter of the British Monarchy and the Church of England (of which he was a member). Horler's works also incorporated his own prejudices. Watson notes both his fiction and non-fiction regularly express negative sentiments about non-English peoples. Horler's heroes, such as Tiger Standish, regularly use derogatory terms like \\"wogs\\" and \\"stinking Italianos\\", and Horler also expressed contempt for both the Americans and the French in his diaries. Writers such as Bill PronziniPronzini, Bill. Gun in Cheek: A Study of \\"Alternative\\" crime fiction. Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1982, (p. 121) and Malcolm Turnbull have noted that Horler's novels regularly featured negative depictions of Jews as criminals and racketeers, and he made denigrating comments about the Jewish community in his memoirs, Excitement: An Impudent Autobiography. Not even the rise of Nazism made any change to Horler's anti-semitism; Turnbull points out Horler subscribes to \\"wartime slanders of Jew-Nazi collaboration and Jewish wartime profiteering in his 1940s titles\\". Horler's book Nighthawk Mops Up (1944) features a Jewish villain, Wilfred Abrahams, who collaborates with the Nazis. Horler also expressed a disapproval of casual sex, especially homosexuality. Horler wrote to the British police demanding a crackdown on what he saw as \\"the alarming increase in sex perversion\\" in London, claiming the city's streets were full of male prostitutes. In his fiction, Horler spent a large amount of time emphasising how \\"virile\\" and \\"masculine\\" his heroes are. One of Horler's characters, the gentleman thief \\"Nighthawk\\", only steals jewels from women he sees as sexually immoral, pausing in his work to scrawl the word \\"Wanton\\" on their pillowcases. Critical reception Literary reviewers of the time, such Dorothy L. Sayers and Compton Mackenzie, generally gave negative opinions on Horler's fiction.Colin Watson, Snobbery With Violence: crime stories and their audience. London : Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1971. (p.85-93) Horler's novels have not been popular since his death. Critics have taken issue with Horler's plots, described by William L. DeAndrea as \\"unbelievable\\" (Horler himself claimed to \\"give old man coincidence's arm a frightful twist\\") and characters seen as clichéd.DeAndrea, William. \\"Horler, Sydney\\", in Encyclopedia Mysteriosa. MacMillan, 1994 (p.174) David Stafford describes Horler as \\"among the worst\\" of British thriller writers.Stafford, David.

A digital successor to the Handbook was released as the \\"Digital Library of Mathematical Functions\\" (DLMF) on May 11, 2010, along with a printed version, the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, published by Cambridge University Press. Overview Since it was first published in 1964, the 1046 page Handbook has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on special functions, containing definitions, identities, approximations, plots, and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of applied mathematics. The notation used in the Handbook is the de facto standard for much of applied mathematics today. At the time of its publication, the Handbook was an essential resource for practitioners. Nowadays, computer algebra systems have replaced the function tables, but the Handbook remains an important reference source. The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that \\"the advent of high-speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables\\". The chapters are: # Mathematical Constants # Physical Constants and Conversion Factors # Elementary Analytical Methods # Elementary Transcendental Functions # Exponential Integral and Related Functions # Gamma Function and Related Functions # Error Function and Fresnel Integrals # Legendre Functions # Bessel Functions of Integral Order # Bessel Functions of Fractional Order # Integrals of Bessel Functions # Struve Functions and Related Functions # Confluent Hypergeometric Functions # Coulomb Wave Functions # Hypergeometric Functions # Jacobian Elliptic Functions and Theta Functions # Elliptic Integrals # Weierstrass Elliptic and Related Functions # Parabolic Cylinder Functions # Mathieu Functions # Spheroidal Wave Functions # Orthogonal Polynomials # Bernoulli and Euler Polynomials, Riemann Zeta Function # Combinatorial Analysis # Numerical Interpolation, Differentiation, and Integration # Probability Functions # Miscellaneous Functions # Scales of Notation # Laplace Transforms Editions Because the Handbook is the work of U.S. federal government employees acting in their official capacity, it is not protected by copyright in the United States.

(468 pages) The book is an abridged version of Abramowitz's and Stegun's Handbook, retaining most of the formulas (except for the first and the two last original chapters, which were dropped), but reducing the numerical tables to a minimum, which, by this time, could be easily calculated with scientific pocket calculators. The references were removed as well. Most known errata were incorporated, the physical constants updated and the now-first chapter saw some slight enlargement compared to the former second chapter.

Sennet was laid down on 8 March 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, launched on 6 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Roscoe W. Downs, and commissioned on 22 August 1944, Commander George E. Porter in command. Sennet was fitted out by 18 September. She held training exercises and torpedo-tube testing off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island until 22 October. The submarine then tested mines and torpedoes for the Mine Warfare Test Station, Solomons Island, Md. On 11 November, Sennet proceeded to the operations area off Balboa, C. Z. and conducted further training exercises. The submarine departed Balboa on 29 November for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 16 December 1944. Sennet's topside armament was increased to two guns, two 40 millimeter guns, and three .50 caliber machine guns before departing Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 5 January 1945.  First and second patrols, January–March 1945  Sennet patrolled north of the Bonin Islands until 28 January. She made two attacks on a large tanker with three escorts on 21 January but scored no hits. The following week, the submarine sank one 500-ton picket boat and damaged another. Sennet refitted at Saipan from 31 January to 7 February, when she began her second war patrol off southern Honshū, Japan. On 13 February, two 300-ton picket boats were sunk by the combined gunfire of Sennet, , and . Three days later, the submarine attacked enemy minelayer the Nariu with an offset spread of torpedoes from her stern tubes, then went deep to . Two torpedoes were heard to explode. While going deep, Sennet was rocked hard by two aircraft bombs which exploded beneath her. The submarine surfaced an hour later and saw a large oil slick and approximately 40 Japanese clinging to debris but no trace of the Nariu which had sunk.  Third and fourth patrols, April–August 1945  Sennet was refitted by in Apra Harbor, Guam, 9 March – 2 April. Patrolling off Honshū again from 3 April to 16 May, she was twice straddled by torpedoes fired from patrol boats while she was surfaced off Miki Saki on 16 April. Three days later, the submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ship Hagane Maru. On 22 April, Sennet attempted to save a P-51 pilot who had bailed out near her but the man went under only from the ship. Attempts to find him were in vain. A repair ship was attacked on 28 April with two electrical torpedoes. The first blew the bow off and the second hit under the mainmast. Hatsushima sank by her stern. On 1 May, Sennett fired five steam torpedoes at an Asashio-class destroyer but it maneuvered and avoided them. At the end of this patrol, the submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor for upkeep and leave. Sennet's most profitable patrol was from 1 July to 9 August in the Sea of Japan. During the patrol, she sank one passenger-cargo ship, two cargo ships, and one tanker totaling 13,105 tons.  1945–1951  When the war ended in the Pacific, Sennet was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and operated from New London, Conn. In June 1946, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) at Balboa, C.Z. From 10 December 1946 to 13 March 1947, Sennet participated in Operation Highjump, the third Byrd Antarctic Expedition. Sennet used the first basic under-ice sonar to establish the feasibility of United States under-ice operations.McLaren, Alfred S., CAPT USN \\"Under the Ice in Submarines\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings July 1981 p.106 Sennet operated from Balboa until 1949 when she was assigned to operate from Key West, Fla., as a unit of Submarine Squadron 12 (SubRon 12). The ship conducted training for submarine and antisubmarine personnel at Key West and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 1951, Sennet was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and returned to her homeport.  1954–1973  On 4 November 1954, Sennet departed Key West on her first deployment to the Mediterranean and service with the 6th Fleet. From her return on 30 January 1955 until 1 August 1959, the submarine conducted training, local, and fleet operations with her squadron. On 1 August, Sennett was reassigned to SubRon 4 and stationed at Charleston, S.C. For the next nine years, the submarine operated from Charleston with the Atlantic Fleet.

It is located 20 km NE of Olsztyn, in the historic region of Warmia. The town dates its beginnings from 1325. Name The German name of the town (\\"Wartenburg\\") has its origins from the town of Wartenburg (Elbe). In Polish the town was known historically as Wartembork, Wartenberg, Wartenbergk, Wathberg, Bartenburg, Warperc, Wasperc, Wartbór or Wartbórz. In the aftermath of World War II, the town was transferred from Germany to Poland. Commission for the Determination of Place Names decided to change the town's name. It was briefly named Nowowiejsk, after local composer Feliks Nowowiejski, in September 1946. In December that year the Commission settled on another name, Barczewo, honouring Polish national activist who fought against Prussian oppression of Poles in Warmia, Walenty Barczewski (1865–1928). History Brick Gothic St. Anne church in the Old Town Church of St. Anna (Inner view) The town was first located in 1325 but was soon after destroyed by Lithuanians. The rebuild town was granted city rights in 1364. In 1466, after the Second Peace of Toruń, the town, then known as \\"Wartberg\\",Barczewo.pl became part of Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia.

Built in 1799, it is located in Carl Schurz Park, at East End Avenue and 88th Street in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan. The mansion overlooks Hell Gate channel in the East River. History Landmark plaque =Before construction and early days= George Washington commandeered a different building on approximately the same site during the American Revolutionary War, as it strategically overlooked Hell Gate. That building, called Belview Mansion, was the country residence of Jacob Walton, a New York merchant. The British destroyed this house during that war. Archibald Gracie then built another building, now known as Gracie Mansion, on the site in 1799, and used it as a country home until 1823, when he had to sell it to pay debts. In the fall of 1801, Gracie hosted a meeting there of New York Federalists, called by Alexander Hamilton, to raise $10,000 for starting the New York Evening Post newspaper, which eventually became the New York Post. =Later history= Other people lived in the house until 1896, when the municipal government seized it and made its grounds part of Carl Schurz Park. It served various functions as part of that park (at various times it housed public restrooms, an ice cream stand, and classrooms) until 1924. From 1924 until 1936, it housed the Museum of the City of New York, and from 1936 until 1942, it was shown as a historical house. In 1942, Robert Moses convinced Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia to appropriate the house as a mayoral residence. Its main two floors are open to the public on a limited basis for guided tours and serve as a small museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. =Recent usage= The house may only be used for official city business. Only visiting public officials and the mayor's family may reside with the mayor at the mansion, even for a single overnight stay. This has prevented some recent mayors from living in the mansion; in 2001 Rudy Giuliani was forced to move out after he had been barred by a judge from bringing his then-girlfriend Judith Nathan to live with him in the mansion, a matter complicated by the fact that his estranged wife, Donna Hanover, refused to vacate the premises. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, likewise, never resided at Gracie Mansion, partially because regulations prevented him from moving in with his long-term partner, Diana Taylor, but also believing that the house should be left open to the public. However, he did use it for meetings and events; he also used the Mansion as a place for official visitors to stay while in the city. At the beginning of Bloomberg's term, he initiated a major restoration of the mansion, funded by an anonymous donor, suspected of being the billionaire mayor himself. Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family currently live in the Gracie Mansion. Architecture Western side Archibald Gracie built the two-story wooden mansion in the Federal style. The design of the structure is attributed to Ezra Weeks, a prominent builder, or John McComb Jr., the architect of New York City Hall and Hamilton Grange, Alexander Hamilton's country home in Harlem, New York. See also: By suggestion of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr.'s wife, Susan, plans were initiated for a new west wing, completed in 1966. The architect of the Susan B.

He was named after Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the 3rd century BC Roman general, famous for defeating the Carthaginian military leader Hannibal. Life Very little is known of Africanus' life. He was the slave of Charles William Howard, 7th Earl of Suffolk, who lived in the \\"Great House\\" in Henbury, Bristol. It is not clear how he came to the household; historians believe that he may have been born into the household as the son of an enslaved West African woman, and named by Howard. One biographer has suggested that Africanus' name implies that Howard intended to free him for loyal service because the Roman historian Polybius wrote about how the Roman general Africanus freed people he had enslaved who promised to work hard. Africanus died in the Great House aged eighteen. Grave A general view of the grave of Scipio He is remembered because of the elaborate grave, consisting of painted headstone and footstone, in the churchyard of St Mary's in Henbury. The grave is grade II* listed. Both stones feature black cherubs and the footstone bears the epitaph: It is thought that 10,000 black slaves and servants were in Britain in the early 18th century, but this is one of the very few memorials to them. Despite the quality of the memorial, there is no record of his burial in the church registers. Sometime between 16 and 17 June 2020 the headstone was vandalised, apparently in retaliation to the damage caused to the statue of Edward Colston by Black Lives Matter protesters. The two incidents have caused local and national uproar. Legacy The author Eugene Byrne featured Scipio Africanus in his 2001 alternative history novel Things Unborn. In this novel people who had suffered an untimely death were reincarnated in an England recovering from a nuclear war; Scipio Africanus was a famous war hero and a detective inspector in the Metropolitan Police. The Bristol-based reggae band Black Roots wrote a song about Scipio Africanus which they performed live at Trinity Hall, Bristol on Channel 4's 10-part series Rockers Roadshow, produced by Mike Wallington and hosted by Mikey Dread in the 1980s.

More commonly, a file association associates a class of files (usually determined by their filename extension, such as \`.txt\`) with a corresponding application (such as a text editor). Associations and verbs A single file extension may have several associations for performing various actions, also known as verbs. Some of the common verbs are: * open to open a file * edit to open a file for editing * print to print a file A picture, for example, may be associated with these words so that open opens the picture in an image viewer, edit opens up an image editing program and print sends the picture to a printer. Implementations Most operating systems support file associations in some form or the other. For example, opening a file from a file manager usually invokes the open verb in order to open the file with its associated application. The \\"open\\" verb invokes the associated application program, which reads the file or document and presents it to the user for viewing, and possibly for editing or other action. Additional actions such as print are usually accessed via a right-click context menu. A mechanism for modifying associations is also usually present. An example for this is the Open With option in the Windows Shell. =Microsoft Windows= The Microsoft Windows series of operating systems, beginning with Windows 3.x supports file extension-based associations.http://www.fandecheng.com/personal/interests/ewindows/windows3x/features.htm Associations are stored in registryHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT Key as sets of verbs for each file extension. Older versions supported open associations stored in WIN.INI. File associations can be displayed and edited using the \`assoc\` command and with the help of the \`ftype\` command it is possible to create association between file type and application which will open files of this type.Microsoft TechNet Assoc article on \`assoc\`Microsoft TechNet Ftype article on \`ftype\` The Windows shell invokes file association actions through COM, drag and drop, command line calls or through Dynamic Data Exchange. Advanced features of Microsoft Windows file associations included manually defining a new file extension with any number of associated actions, a primary default action, showing extensions only for specific file types, customizing the file type icon and description and customizing associated MIME type and their handling (how to handle file types for files downloaded or directly opened from within the Internet Explorer browser). The ability to configure advanced file association functionality, however, was removed in Windows Vista and later operating systems. =Linux= Linux-based GUIs, such as KDE and GNOME, support MIME type-based associations. For example, the MIME type \`text/plain\` would be associated with a text editor. =Mac OS= The Classic Mac OS used type codes and creator codes to associate each file with its corresponding application, regardless of file extension. The more recent macOS also supports file extension–based associations. Application bundles in macOS declare supported file types in their Info.plist file. For each of these specified types, a Uniform Type Identifier is given, along with a list of 'tags' which define how a file or data of this type could be identified. For example, the JPEG type is defined with a UTI of 'public.jpeg', and tagged with the extensions 'jpg' and 'jpeg', the MIME type 'image/jpeg' and the type code 'JPEG'.Mac OS X Reference Library - Uniform Type Identifier Concepts The operating system uses this information to generate a list of applications which are able to open each type. Within Finder (software) each file will be identified with a UTI and open with the default application for that type. The user may also select from a list of other applications which support the type. Using this system, types are also associated with data for which there is no file name or the file extension is missing.

Pieces written for SATB (the most common combination, and used by most hymn tunes) can be sung by choruses of mixed genders, by choirs of men and boys, or by four soloists. There is a lack of general agreement on other initialisms and abbreviations. Tr for treble, Mz (or similar) for mezzo- soprano, Ba, Bar or Bari for baritone are self-explanatory, while C could be taken for canto, the highest part, or for contralto, usually implying a female alto(s) as opposed to a countertenor (Ct). SATB div. (divisi, or divided) denotes that one or more individual parts divide into two or more parts at some point in the piece, often sharing the same staff. A single choir with two of each voice type should be written SSAATTBB, unless it is laid out for two identical choirs, in which case it is SATB/SATB. Publishers usually include such descriptions in their catalogues of choral works, although many fail to provide sufficient detail, commonly omitting, for example, the term div. where it is required fully to describe the resources required by the composer. Also misleading can be the use of B for a baritone part or S for a mezzo-soprano part; an example of this is Stanford's motet \\"Eternal Father\\" which, though marked SSATBB, is for one each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass.

In Zen, however, the real treasure of the Dharma is not to be found in books but in one's own Buddha Nature and the ability to see this Correct View (first of the Noble Eightfold Path) of the treasure of Dharma is called the \\"Treasure of the Correct Dharma Eye\\". In the legends of the Zen tradition, the Shōbōgenzō has been handed down from teacher to student going all the way back to the Buddha when he transmitted the Shobogenzo to his disciple Mahākāśyapa thus beginning the Zen lineage that Bodhidharma brought to China. The legend of the transmission of the Shōbōgenzō to Mahākāśyapa is found in several Zen texts and is one of the most referred to legends in all the writings of Zen. Among the famous koan collections, it appears as Case 6 in the Wumenguan (The Gateless Checkpoint) and Case 2 in the Denkoroku (Transmission of Light). In the legend as told in the Wumenguan, the Buddha holds up a flower and no one in the assembly responds except for Arya Kashyapa who gives a broad smile and laughs a little. Seeing Mahākāśyapa's smile the Buddha said, > I possess the Treasury of the Correct Dharma Eye, the wonderful heart-mind > of Nirvana, the formless true form, the subtle Dharma gate, not established > by written words, transmitted separately outside the teaching. I hand it > over and entrust these encouraging words to Kashyapa. =Dahui's Shōbōgenzō and Dōgen's Shinji Shōbōgenzō= Dahui Zonggao, the famous 12th century popularizer of koans in Song Dynasty China, wrote a collection of kōans with the Chinese title Zhengfa Yanzang (正法眼藏). In Japanese this is read as Shōbōgenzō, using the same kanji for its title as Dōgen's later work. When Dōgen visited China in 1223, he first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably first came into contact with Dahui's Zhengfa Yanzang. In his book Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation, the modern scholar Carl Bielefeldt acknowledges that Dōgen likely took the title from Dahui for his own kōan collection, known now as the Shinji Shōbōgenzō. He later used the same title again for what is now his most well known work, the Kana Shōbōgenzō (now almost always referred to simply as \\"the Shōbōgenzō\\"): > Indeed the fact that Dōgen styled his effort \\"Shōbō genzō\\" suggests that he > had as his model a similar compilation of the same title by the most famous > of Sung masters, Ta-Hui Tsung-kao [Dahui Zonggao]. Unlike the latter, Dōgen > was content here simply to record the stories without interjecting his own > remarks. A few years later, however, he embarked on a major project to > develop extended commentaries on many of these and other passages from the > Ch'an literature. The fruit of this project was his masterpiece--the > remarkable collection of essays known as the kana, or \\"vernacular\\", Shōbō > genzō. Compilation of the Shōbōgenzō The different component texts--referred to as fascicles--of the Kana Shōbōgenzō were written between 1231 and 1253--the year of Dōgen's death (Dōgen, 2002, p. xi). Unlike most Zen writings originating in Japan at that time, including Dōgen's own Shinji Shōbōgenzō and Eihei Koroku, which were written in Classical Chinese, the Kana Shōbōgenzō was written in Japanese. The essays in Shōbōgenzō were delivered as sermons in a less formal style than the Chinese language sermons of the Eihei Koroku. Some of the fascicles were recorded by Dōgen, while others were recorded by his disciples. Dōgen rearranged the order of the fascicles that make up the Shōbōgenzō several times during his own lifetime, and also edited the content of individual fascicles. After his death, various editors added and removed fascicles to make different versions of the Shōbōgenzō. In pre-modern times there were four major versions that consisted of 60, 75, 12, and 28 fascicles, with the 60 fascicle version being the earliest and the 28 fascicle version the latest. The first two were arranged by Dōgen himself, with the 75 fascicle version containing several fascicles that had been edited from the earlier 60 fascicle version. Several copies of both the 60 and 75 fascicle versions exist, including one containing Dōgen's handwriting and that of his student, Koun Ejō. On the other hand, the 12 fascicle version, also known as the Yōkōji manuscript after the temple where it was found in 1936, is known from only two examples, one copied in 1420 and the other recopied from that in 1446. This version contains 5 fascicles not found in the older versions, including the only surviving manuscript of Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon'. It also contains a note at the end of Hachi Dainin Gaku written by Koun Ejō indicating that it was to be the last fascicle of a 100 fascicle version; this was never completed due to Dōgen's illness near the end of his life. It is unclear which chapters this 100 fascicle version would have included and in what order. Finally, the 28 fascicle version, also known as the Eihei-ji manuscript or the \\"Secret Shōbōgenzō\\" (), dates from the mid-1300's and actually only contains 26 fascicle because Shin Fukatoku appears twice and Butsudō is included twice in two different versions. The fascicles of the Eihei-ji manuscript were taken from the 75 and 12 fascicle versions and still retain the numbering system used from their source collections. Yoibutsu Yobutsu is an exception and is numbered as fascicle 38, which does not correspond to any extant version. Other pre-modern versions of the Shōbōgenzō exist, all of which were rearrangements of the four main versions discussed above, often with additional material from Dōgen that he did not intend to include. Bonsei, who died in the early 15th century, created an 84 fascicle version consisting of the 75 fascicle version plus 9 books from the 60 fascicle version. Four copies of Bonsei's collection survive, with the oldest dating from 1644. An 89 fascicle version called the Daijōji manuscript was put together in 1689 by Manzan Dōhaku based on Bonsei's version of 84 plus 5 additional fascicles, including Bendōwa, Jūundō Shiki, and Jikuin Mon, which were not previously considered part of the Shōbōgenzō. He also ordered the books based on the date they were written and not on the order Dōgen intended, suggest he likely believed the ordering was a later decision not made by Dōgen himself. Hangyo Kōzen, aiming to make the most comprehensive version of the Shōbōgenzō, compiled a 96 fascicle version called the Komazawa University Library manuscript containing every known book from previous versions except Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon. It also included more additional writings, including the apocryphal Chinzo and several variant versions of other chapters. Kōzen's version became the basis for the first printed version of the Shōbōgenzō, the Honzan edition. Finally, a 78 book version was made by Tenkei Denson while he was preparing his commentary, Benchū, on the text. He thought that the 60 fascicle version was compiled by Giun and was the oldest, most correct version, and as result his version is identical for the first 59 fascicles except for two replacements from other versions and one combination of two fascicles into one. The remainder is added from the 12 and 75 fascicle versions with 10 fascicles from those being specifically excluded. Modern editions of Shōbōgenzō contain 95 fascicles based on the late 17th century 96 fascicle version of Hangyo Kozen, the 35th abbot of Dōgen's monastery Eihei- ji. This began as a 90 fascicle version, the first to be printed on woodblocks rather than hand copied, beginning in 1815 and known as the Honzan edition. The six fascicles that were removed included the inauthentic Chinzo as well as five chapters regarded as secrets of the Sōtō School. The original woodblocks are now stored at Eihei-ji. In 1906 the revised Honzan version of 95 fascicles including the five \\"secret\\" chapters was published. The only chapter originally intended to be part of the Shōbōgenzō missing from the revised Honzan version at this stage was Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon because it was not discovered until 1936. In 1929, the Sōtōshū Zensho edition was released adding back Chinzo. It was removed again in a revised edition in 1970, and then added again in the 1974 Zoku Sōtōshū Zensho along with Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon. Many other versions were made in the 20th century, some of which indiscriminately combined sections from different manuscripts. Today, arguably the most faithful printed version in Japanese is the 1988 edition compiled by Kōdō Kawamura consisting of the original 75 fascicle version from the single 1547 Ryūmonji manuscript, the 12 fascicle 1446 Yōkōji manuscript, nine uncollected works not originally intended for the Shōbōgenzō, and initial drafts of seven chapters. History of Textual Analysis The earliest commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō were written by two of Dōgen's disciples, Yōkō Senne and Kyōgō. Kyōgō compiled two commentaries on the 75-fascicle version of Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō, the first of which is called Shōbōgenzō shō (正法眼蔵抄) and the second Shōbōgenzō gokikigaki (正法眼蔵御聴書). Collectively, they are called Gokikigakishō (御聴書抄), which is usually abbreviated as Goshō (御抄). Senne is believed to be the author of the Shōbōgenzō Gokikigaki due to the use of the honorific modifier go (御), which would not normally be used to refer to one's own writing. The Gokikigaki contains a date of 1263, suggesting Senne may have completed it around that time. Kyōgō began his Shōbōgenzō shō in 1303 and completed it in 1308. There is no evidence that these commentaries were widely read at the time they were produced. In fact, the first time the Goshō is known to be mentioned in historical documents is in 1586, when it was saved from a fire at Senpuku-ji, a temple in Oita Prefecture in Kyushu. The Buddhist studies scholar Genryū Kagamishima has written that Senne and Kyōgō's commentaries form the doctrinal core of the modern Sōtō Zen school. Within a few generations of Dōgen's death, the historical record becomes mostly silent on textual engagement with Dōgen's work, including the Shōbōgenzō. Although most important Sōtō Zen temples had copies of one or more fascicles of the Shōbōgenzō, access was restricted to senior monks at that particular temple, making textual comparisons or compilations virtually impossible. Due to the many different recessions of the text—the 60-, 75-, 12-, 25-fascicle versions discussed above—scribal errors, and variant versions of individual fascicles, the Shōbōgenzō was thought to possibly be inauthentic at the beginning of a Tokugawa Era. In 1700, Manzan Dōhaku appealed to the authority of the Shōbōgenzō when petitioning the government's Agency of Temples and Shrines to abolish the temple-dharma lineage system (garanbō) which has arisen several generations after Dōgen's death and tied a monk's lineage not to his teacher, but to a temple. In 1703 the government not only agreed with Manzan, but proclaimed that the Sōtō school must base its practices on Dōgen's teachings. From this point, study and analysis of Shōbōgenzō greatly increased. One of the earliest commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō was written by a monk named Tenkei Denson (1638-1735) in opposition to the emerging pro-Dōgen movement led by Manzan. Tenkei's commentary, called Benchū, was written from 1726 to 1729 using the 60 fascicle version. In it, he harshly criticized the text, rejected several fascicles altogether, and made extensive \\"corrections\\" and revisions to the source text. Mujaku Dōchū (1653-1744), a Rinzai monk, wrote a commentary from 1725 to 1726 that made many of the same points. Both Tenkei and Mujaku argued for a unity of all schools of Zen, but the Shōbōgenzō harshly criticized some approaches to Zen practice, especially those found in Rinzai lineages in China during Dōgen's life. Tenkei and Mujaku both also argued that Dōgen did not understand Chinese grammar based on his unusual interpretation of Chinese quotations. Tenkei also consulted Senne and Kyōgō's Goshō commentary discussed above, but rejected it. Around the same time Menzan Zuihō was dedicating much of his life to analyzing the Shōbōgenzō in order to uncover Dōgen's source material. Menzan's student Fuzan and his students put this extensive study into writing in the 1770s. Menzan also made extensive use of Senne and Kyōgō's Goshō commentary in when studying the Shōbōgenzō, and he criticized Tenkei for having rejected it. Within a few years the monk Honkō made a commentary on the text and translated it into what was at the time the more respectable language of Classical Chinese. Commentaries were also made by the monks Zōkai and Rōran. An abridged collection of a variety of Dōgen's work appeared at this time called The Record of Eihei Dogen, which the famous poet Ryōkan wrote a verse on. English Translations The Dōgen Zenji Zenshu contains all 95 Japanese fascicles, untranslated. There are now four complete English translations of the Kana Shobogenzo. A translation by Gudo Nishijima and Chodo Cross is available under two titles, Master Dogen's Shobogenzo and Shōbōgenzō: The True Dharma-Eye Treasury. The latter is freely distributed digitally by Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK) with many other Mahāyāna texts. Kosen Nishiyama and John Stevens have a translation titled Shobogenzo (The Eye and Treasury of the True Law). Shasta Abbey has a free digital translation of the Shobogenzo and offers other Soto Zen works. A translation by a \\"team of translators that represent a Who’s Who of American Zen\\" and edited by Kazuaki Tanahashi, Treasury of the True Dharma Eye: Zen Master Dogen's Shobo Genzo, was released in mid-2011. Additionally, the Stanford-based Soto Zen Text Project, a project to translate Dōgen and other Sōtō texts, has completed several fascicles, freely distributed in digital format.

It was the first judo club in Europe. Name and symbol The full name of the society is the Budokwai (The Way of Knighthood Society) but it is normally called The Budokwai. The name Budokwai was chosen by the society's founder Gunji Koizumi as a combination of the Japanese words bu (武) meaning military or martial, do (道) meaning the way or code, kwai (会) meaning public building or a society/club. This translates into English as Society of the Martial Way. The symbol of the Budokwai is a stylised version of the kanji 武 in white on a blue cherry blossom, Koizumi said he chose the design as the character bu is made from the components 止, meaning stop, and 戈, meaning spear or fighting because \\" the aim of martial training is to stop fighting.\\" History Gunji Koizumi created the Budokwai as a society to teach judo, kendo and other Japanese arts to members of the public. He founded a dojo at 15 Lower Grosvenor Place, Victoria, London SW1 and the club official opened on Saturday 26 January 1918 with 12 members, making it the oldest judo club in Europe. It is also the oldest Japanese martial arts club in Europe. The first 36 members were Japanese, the first English man didn’t join until March and the first English woman, Katherine Cooper-White, becoming the 60th member. Koizumi became the first president of the Budokwai and Yukio Tani the first chief judo instructor. In July 1920, Dr. Jigoro Kano (the founder of judo) visited Britain and the Budokwai for the first time, he was accompanied by Hikoichi Aida who stayed in Britain and instructed at the Budokwai for two years. A member named Tanabe received his first Dan, becoming the Budokwai's first home-grown black belt. Tani and Koizumi were promoted to nidan. The club held annual shows between 11 May 1918 and 1968 after which shows were only held on special occasions. The Budokwai was instrumental in the formation of the first British national and European wide judo organisations. Koizumi discussed his idea of forming a British nation Judo organisation and a European organisation with the Budokwai committee and in 1948 the chairman of the Budokwai, John Barnes, invited all British Judo clubs and all the Judo and Jujitsu clubs in Europe to a conference hosted by the Budokwai. The British Conference was held on 24 July 1948 at the Imperial College Union, London and during that three-hour meeting the British Judo Association was founded. This was the first ever amateur national judo association. The international conference took place on 26 and 28 July 1948 with four voting countries, Austria, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy, and one non-voting country, France, attending. The Budokwai's Trevor Leggett was elected the conference's chairman and a constitution drafted by the Budikwai was tabled. After alterations and discussion of the constitution a unanimous vote formed the European Judo Union. In 1953 Teizo Kawamura, then a 6th Dan, came from the Kodokan in Japan to become chief instructor. After thirty-five years, the Budokwai moved to 4 Gilston Road, South Kensington, London, SW10 9SL. The new premises were officially opened in September 1954 by the Japanese Ambassador H.E. Matsumoto throwing Kawamura. In the 1960s the club began teaching karate with links to the Japan Karate Association with a number of Japanese instructors teaching at the Budokwai, including Keinosuke Enoeda 1963 All-Japan champion, who became the chief instructor. In the same decade aikido began to be practiced at the club. With the growth of international Judo competition and especially when judo became an Olympic sport in 1964 the emphasis of judo at the Budokwai moved towards sport and competition judo. Three Budokwai members made were part of the first British Olympic team, Brian Jacks, Syd Hoare and Tony Sweeney. Activities In 2017 The Budokwai ran classes in Judo, Karate, Aikido, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Pilates, Hontai Yōshin-Ryū Ju-Jutsu and activities for babies and toddlers. Judo is taught every day with separate classes held for children of different ages, adult beginners and experienced judoka. Separate grading events take place once a month on Sundays. As of 2013, the chief instructor is Peter Blewett who has held the post since 1986 and the head junior instructor is Larry Stevenson. Shotokan Karate is practiced five days a week at the Budokwai with both children's and adult classes. The chief karate instructor is Yoshinobu Ohta who holds a karate 7th Dan. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is run by Ray Stevens. Hontai Yōshin-ryū ju-jutsu takes place once a week with instructor Dr. Mike McClure 6th Dan. The Budokwai in the media The Budokwai had a showreel filmed in 2014, directed by actor/director Lucy Charles and shot by WhitePartridge Media. In recent years The Budokwai has also featured on BT Sport's Beyond the Octagon, BBC One's The One Show and most recently in a short film for The British Open. The film was commissioned by the British Judo Association, and starred Peter Blewett and Kyle Perry. The film, Hard Lesson The Gentle Way was produced and directed by Lucy Charles, The Sports Presentation Company and Six More Than Forty. The Pyjama Game a book by Mark Law was described by the Observer as “A fascinating journey in which he unravels this most opaque of sports with humour, verve and style. Part travelogue, part history, part chronicle of midlife discovery, The Pyjama Game is an illuminating exposition of an enigmatic and marginal sport.” Independent on Sunday “A fantastic voyage , beautifully written, through this most challenging of sports.” Matthew d’Ancona in The Spectator called it “A brilliant exploration of judo” The Pyjama Game, which tells the story of judo from its Samurai origins through its development by Jigoro Kano and adoption across the world, includes accounts of the careers of some of the greatest champions including Yasuhiro Yamashita, Neil Adams, Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki and Tamura Ryoko Tani. Mark Law has trained at the Budokwai in Chelsea, London since 1994 where he has studied under Tony Sweeney, Ray Stevens, Peter Blewett, Winston Gordon and Roger Gracie.

The conflict was part of a wider rebel war in which revolutionary organizations of Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs all fought over Macedonia. Gradually the Greek and Bulgarian bands gained the upper hand, but the conflict was ended by the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. Background Initially the conflict was waged through educational and religious means, with a fierce rivalry developing between supporters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Greek speaking or Slavic speaking who generally identified as Greek), and supporters of the Bulgarian Exarchate, which had been established by the Ottomans in 1870. As Ottoman rule in the Balkans crumbled in the late 19th century, competition arose between Greeks and Bulgarians (and to a lesser extent also other ethnic groups such as Serbs, Aromanians and Albanians) over the multi- ethnic region of Macedonia.Clogg, Richard. A Concise History of Greece. Cambridge University Press, 1992. 257 pp. p.81. The defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 was a loss that appalled Greeks.Clogg, Richard. A Concise History of Greece. Cambridge University Press, 1992. p. 71. The Ethniki Eteria was dissolved by Prime Minister Theotokis. Greco–Bulgarian relations in Ottoman Macedonia In 1894, a Bulgarian organization known as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) had been founded and self-identified as being representative of all nations in Macedonia, along with anti-Ottoman revolutionaries in Thessaloniki, with the aim of liberating Macedonia and Thrace from Ottoman rule, potentially to join Bulgaria. IMRO was declared as a Macedonian organization open to all ethnic groups in Macedonia and, earlier on, IMRO claimed that it was fighting for the autonomy of Macedonia and not for annexation to Bulgaria. However, according to some authors and historians, it later became an agent serving Bulgarian interests in Balkan politics with the aim of eventually uniting the entirety of Macedonia with Bulgaria, first in struggles against the Ottoman Empire and later against the Serbian-led Yugoslav successor state controlling the territory of Vardar Macedonia and the Greek state which controlled the territory of Aegean Macedonia.Encyclopedia of terrorism, Cindy C. Combs, Martin W. Slann, Infobase Publishing, 2009, , p. 135. One major event representing the culmination of these actions is the assassination of the Serbian King of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes during the inter-war period by an IMRO sniper, likely working for Bulgarian interests. In practice, most of the followers of the IMRO were local Macedonian Bulgarians, though they also had some pro-Bulgarian Aromanian supporters,Andrew Rossos, Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History, Hoover Press, 2013, ,p. 105.Philip Jowett, Armies of the Balkan Wars 1912–13: The priming charge for the Great War, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012, , p. 21.Raymond Detrez, 2014, Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria, Rowman & Littlefield, , p. 520. like Pitu Guli, Mitre The Vlach, Ioryi Mucitano and Alexandar Coshca. Many of the members of the organization saw Macedonian autonomy as an intermediate step to unification with Bulgaria,Идеята за автономия като тактика в програмите на национално- освободителното движение в Македония и Одринско (1893-1941), Димитър Гоцев, 1983, Изд. на Българска Академия на Науките, София, 1983, c. 34.; in English: The idea for autonomy as a tactics in the programs of the National Liberation movements in Macedonia and Adrianople regions 1893-1941\\", Sofia, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Dimitar Gotsev, 1983, p 34.

In English – How Gotse Delchev explained the aim of the struggle against the Ottomans in 1901: \\"...We have to fight for autonomy of Macedonia and Adrianople regions as a stage for their future unification with our common fatherland, Bulgaria.\\" but others saw as their aim the creation of a Balkan federal state, with Macedonia as an equal member.The last interview with the leader of IMRO, Ivan Michailov in 1989 - newspaper 'Democratsia', Sofia, 8 January 2001, pp. 10-11. Already from 1895 the Supreme Macedonian- Adrianople Committees were formed in Sofia in order to reinforce the Bulgarian actions in Ottoman Empire. One of Komitadjis first activities was the capture of the predominantly Greek town of Meleniko (today Melnik, Bulgaria), but they couldn't hold it for more than a few hours. Bulgarian bands destroyed the Pomak village of Dospat where they massacred local inhabitants. This kind of activity alerted Greeks and Serbians, who made a farce of the slogan \\"Macedonia to Macedonians\\", being against the constitution of Macedonia as separate state. The situation in Macedonia became heated and started to affect European public opinion. In April 1903, a group called Gemidzhii with some assistance from the IMRO blew up the French ship Guadalquivir and the Ottoman Bank in the harbour of Thessaloniki. In August 1903, IMRO managed to organise an uprising (the Ilinden Uprising) in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. After the forming of the short-lived Kruševo Republic, the insurrection was suppressed by the Ottomans with the subsequent destruction of many villages and the devastation of large areas in Western Macedonia and around Kırk Kilise near Adrianople. The failure of the 1903 insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left-wing (federalist) faction and a right-wing faction (centralists) which weakened the organization additionally. Hellenic Macedonian Committee Seal of the Greek Macedonian Committee depicting Alexander the Great and Byzantine Emperor Basil II Pavlos Melas in Macedonomachos uniform In order to strengthen Greek efforts for Macedonia, the Hellenic Macedonian Committee was formed in 1903, under the leadership of wealthy publisher Dimitrios Kalapothakis; its members included Ion Dragoumis and Pavlos Melas.Konstantinos Vakalopoulos, Historia tou voreiou hellenismou, vol 2, 1990, pp. 429-430 Its fighters were known as Makedonomachoi (\\"Macedonian fighters\\"). Under these conditions, in 1904 a vicious guerrilla war broke as response of IMRO activities between Bulgarian and Greek bands within Ottoman Macedonia. The Bishop of Kastoria, Germanos Karavangelis sent to Macedonia by the ambassador of Greece Nikolaos Mavrokordatos and the consul of Greece in Monastiri, Ion Dragoumis, realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition. While Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the very capable Cretan officer Georgios Katehakis.Bulgarian Historical Review, vol 31, 1-4, 2003, p 117 \\"Only a few days later -on November 1- Katehakis arrived in Macedonia as Melas' successor\\" Bishop Germanos Karavangelis animated the Greek population against the IMRO and formed committees to promote the Greek national interests. Taking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMRO, Katehakis and Karavangelis initially succeeded to recruit some IMRO former members and to organize guerrilla groups, that were later reinforced with people sent from Greece and thus were mainly composed of ex-officers of the Hellenic Army, volunteers brought from Crete, from the Mani area of the Peloponnese, as well as Macedonian Greeks, such as Nikolaos Manos, Theodoros Adam, Dimitrios Stagas, Konstantinos Papastavrou, Georgios Modis, Athanasios Stavroudis, Michael Sionidis, Ioannis Ramnalis, Zisis Verros, Georgios Thomopoulos, Iraklis Patikas, Ioannis Simanikas, Periklis Drakos, Ioannis Martzios, Dimitrios Golnas, Petros Christou, Charalambos Boufidis, Slavophones such as Dimitris Dalipis and Evangelos Natsis, and even former IMRO members such as Gonos Yotas and Kottas. Greek activity Periklis Drakos from Kavala with co-fighters The band of slavophone Gonos Yotas fought with the Greek side. The Greek state became concerned, not only because of Bulgarian penetration in Macedonia but also due to Serbian interests, which were concentrated mainly in Skopje and Bitola area. The rioting in Macedonia and especially the death of Pavlos Melas in 1904 (he was the first Greek officer to enter Macedonia with guerrillas and was killed in battle with the Ottoman army) caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece. This led to the decision to send more guerrilla troops in order to thwart Bulgarian efforts to bring all of the Slavic-speaking population of Macedonia on their side. The Greek General Consulate in Thessaloniki, under Lambros Koromilas, became the centre of the struggle, coordinating the guerrilla troops, distributing military material and nursing the wounded. Fierce conflicts between the Greeks and Bulgarians started in the area of Kostur, in the Giannitsa Lake area, and elsewhere. During 1905, guerilla activity increased and the Makedonomachoi gained significant advantage within 10 months, extending their control towards the areas of Mariovo and East Macedonia, Kastanohoria (near Kastoria), the plains north and south of Florina and the routes around Monastir. However, from early 1906 the situation became critical and the forces of the Makedonomachoi were forced to withdraw from various areas. Their manpower during that period was reduced from 1,000 to ca. 200, perhaps a little more than the Komitadjis, but nevertheless the groups of Tellos Agras and Ioannis Demestichas had some success in the marsh of Giannitsa. There were great advances of the Serb forces, joined by Muslim Slavs, in summer of 1906 in the northern areas of the Sanjak of Skopje. While the guerrilla groups confronted the Ottoman Army, the Ottoman administration often ignored the activity of the Greek guerrillas, and according to Dakin assisted them against the Bulgarians outright. However, once the subversive potential of the Bulgarian side had been neutralised, Ottoman policy ended the favourable neutrality to the Greek side and embarked upon \\"relentless persecutions\\" against the andartes, though even then their main interest was to \\"suppress the Bulgarian gangs\\" Crimes War crimes were committed by both sides during the Macedonian struggle. According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents,David Barchard, The Fearless and Self- Reliant Servant: The Life and Career of Sir Alfred Biliotti (1833-1895), p.50 starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers,; but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani (today Vasiliada, Greece), which was an Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands.The Macedonian question, 1893-1908, from Western sources; Nadine Lange-Akhund; 1998 p.279 According to British reports on political crimes (including the above- mentioned Biliotti report), during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed (66 before 1901, 200 between 1901 and 1903, 3300 between 1903 and 1908 and 600 between 1908 and 1912), excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality.Basil C. Gounaris; Preachers of God and martyrs of the Nation: The politics of murder in Ottoman Macedonia in the early 20th century; Balkanologie, Vol. IX, December 2005 These conflicts ended after the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions, and to provide a constitution. Consequences The success of Greek efforts in Macedonia was an experience that gave confidence to the country. It helped develop an intention to annex Greek-speaking areas, and bolster Greek presence in the still Ottoman-ruled Macedonia. The events in Macedonia, specifically the consequences of the conflicts between Greek and Bulgarian national activists, including Greek massacres against the Bulgarian population in 1905 and 1906, gave rise to pogroms against the ca. 70,000-80,000 strong Greek communities that lived in Bulgaria, who were considered to share responsibility (including the support given to the guerrillas by some Bulgarian Greeks) for the actions of the Greek guerrilla groups. Nevertheless, the Young Turk movement resulted in a few instances of collaboration between Greek and Bulgarian bands, while this time the official policy in both countries continue to support the penetration of armed fighters into Ottoman Macedonia, but without having fully ensured that there would be no attacks on each other. Legacy The Greek fighters were portrayed by Greek writer Penelope Delta in her novel Τά μυστικά τοῦ Βάλτου (Ta Mystiká tou Váltou – The Secrets of the Swamp), as well as in the book of memoirs Ὁ Μακεδονικός Ἀγών (The Macedonian Struggle) by Germanos Karavangelis, while on the other side, the IMRO and their activities are depicted in the book Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit: A Californian in the Balkan Wars, written by Albert Sonnichsen, an American volunteer in the IMRO during the Macedonian Struggle.

The series has 62 episodes, and is centered on a group of aircraft who live in the fictional city of Tarrytown. The episodes are commonly distributed in 25-minute-long (as without commercials) pairs, with one header sequence and one end credits for each pair. Each episode contains one or more songs. The theme song and the majority of the other songs were written by well-known children's singer/songwriter Stephen Michael Schwartz, and sung by his popular musical group, Parachute Express. Created by David and Deborah Michel, the series is intended to be educational and to teach life and moral lessons to children (and sometimes also to teenagers and parents). History Jay Jay's debut model (1994) as seen on the pilot episode: Jay Jay's First Flight. In late 1994, a short live- action series was produced at AMS Production Company in Dallas, Texas, with real model plane characters, and handcrafted human characters; they had the same personalities as in the later series. This original series was narrated similarly to the first eleven seasons of Thomas & Friends or Theodore Tugboat. Three videos were released: Jay Jay's First Flight in December 1994, Old Oscar Leads the Parade in February 1995, and Tracy's Handy Hideout in October 1996. This original series was narrated by and features the voices of John William Galt. These three were known as the \\"pilot series\\". On November 2, 1998, the CGI-animated/live-action series premiered on The Learning Channel as part of the Ready Set Learn block. Debi Derryberry took on the role of Jay Jay after Bergman's death in 1999, with no new characters voiced by her. The show was close captioned by the National Captioning Institute with the old close caption credit logo when seen on the Learning Channel back then. The Learning Channel pulled the series on March 14, 2000. On June 11, 2001, all episodes began broadcasting on PBS Kids; the end credits changed, and additional episodes were created from 2001–2005. VHS and DVD editions were released by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment through 2003 as part of their \\"Columbia TriStar Family Fun\\" collection. Additional distribution was added with Tommy Nelson, the children's division of book publisher Thomas Nelson, although the series is not overtly \\"Christian\\". Voice actress Mary Kay Bergman provided the original voice of Jay Jay, Herky, Savannah, and Revvin Evan. After her death, Debi Derryberry and Donna Cherry replaced her. In 2005, new episodes were produced featuring additional characters, including the red Latina plane Lina. Each episode begins featuring a Jay Jay's Mysteries segment in which Jay Jay and Lina explore such things that may be mysteries to the intended age group, such as how planes fly, and how the five senses are used. The mysteries segment is followed by a story that comes from the original episodes of the series, so in effect, the new series repackages previously broadcast content. Production The series was produced by Modern Cartoons in Oxnard, California, United States. Unlike Thomas & Friends, this series used a variety of animation techniques: * The backgrounds were miniature sets (usually built on two sheets of plywood). * The humans, including Brenda Blue, are live action people and shot in front of a greenscreen. * The planes were computer models created in Maya and a proprietary software. * The movement of the planes was recorded by playing out the scene with wood models equipped with magnetic position sensors. The planes had a switch to aid landing and taxiing, due to some minor fluctuations in the magnetic positioning data. * The planes' faces and lip synching were done by face tracking, a technique where reflective spots are put on a voice actor's face. The voice track is digitally recorded along with the spot data. Then the face is rendered using a form of parametric animation. * Head movement and other effects were done by joysticks. The complex mathematical and CGI issues were solved by Frank Ford Little, PhD. A number of proprietary software systems were used: * Data/audio recording and smoothing were done on a Windows machine. * Daily cuts were done on \\"Compaq Alpha\\" computers running a 64-bit version of Windows NT 4.0. Characters The planes and ground vehicles are CGI characters, while the humans are live-action actors. Relationship words for the airplane characters refer to being in loco parentis for purposes of upbringing, and education, not to biological parenthood. The story says that (some of) the airplane characters were made in factories. Some of the stories describe characters as doing actions off-screen that would need foldaway arms (e.g. Big Jake digging holes), but those arms are never seen on-screen. =Aircraft characters= * Jay Jay. Male. Child. Small blue (originally brown in the pilot series) jet plane. He is the titular character and main protagonist of the series. Voiced by John William Galt in the pilot series and in the CGI/live-action series, originally Mary Kay Bergman, then replaced with Debi Derryberry after her death. * Tracy. Female. Child.

Voiced by John William Galt in the pilot series and Sandy Fox in the CGI/live-action series. * Herky. Male. Child. Small yellow helicopter. In the pilot series, he spoke with a stutter (like famous Looney Tunes character Porky Pig), provided by John William Galt, who voiced all the other characters.

History Melrose Community Reformed Church at E 156th Street and Elton Avenue Looking northwest at apartment building on Melrose Avenue and E 154th Street Melrose was a village in the town of Morrisania, in the county of Westchester before being incorporated into New York City in 1874 as part of the Twenty-Third Ward. Originally a dense working-class neighborhood, the housing that was often hastily built to capitalize on the turn of the 20th century immigrant escape from Manhattan soon became unsuitable to all but the poorest. A mass exodus soon took place as New York City policy–induced arson soon ravaged the neighborhood throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1973, the City of New York dismantled the Third Avenue El (an original draw to the neighborhood) due to low ridership. By the 1980s the neighborhood had decayed severely, and much of the original housing stock was lost. Vacant buildings and then lots became commonplace. Since the mid-1990s, but especially in the 2000s, significant renewal has taken place. A prominent player in the revitalization efforts has been the group Nos Quedamos which in English means \\"we stay\\". Many abandoned structures have been renovated and many lots have been constructed on. In most recent years the area has seen a significant \\"Green\\" construction boom. Leading the borough in the number of LEED certified apartment buildings, the largest being Via Verde, winner of the 2013 Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal. Melrose is also home to The Bronx campus of Boricua College. Despite lingering social problems due to a continued significant poverty presence, Melrose has come a long way from a previously \\"forgotten\\" neighborhood. Four historic Melrose churches date to before 1900. The German Methodist Church (1878) 790 Elton Ave., The German Reformed Church (1885) (seen in the distance with white steeple picture above) 744 Elton Ave., Immaculate Conception Church (1887) 389 E. 150th St. and the German Lutheran Church (1895) 376 E. 156th St. The Melrose neighborhood has grown since Jimmy Carter's famous visit to the Bronx in 1977 and will continue to do so as the city's last parcels are sold for development. Many parcels are still in the development phase, but will skyrocket the Melrose population. In 2012, residents expressed concern regarding the Melrose Metro-North station in the neighborhood. Residents would like to see more frequent service, but track and capacity limitations hinder the amount of service available for the stop. Other concerns regarded the lack of handicap access, and the past closure of the main entrance to the stop. The main entrance was closed when the community was at the height of its turmoil, but as the community has regained its footing the desire to have the station open to the primary commercial street, East 161st Street, has grown.

It is located south of Heidenau, in the Müglitz valley and lies at the northeastern foot of the Eastern Ore Mountains. It is accessed by the Pirna interchange of highway A17, and by the Dohna (Sachs) and Köttewitz stations of the Müglitz Valley Railway. History Dohna is one of the oldest towns in Saxony. Traces of settlement dating back to the 16th century BC (Bronze Age) have been found. The Dohna Castle on a strategic hill at the entrance to the Müglitz valley was probably already built in the middle of the 10th century. The town Dohna was first documented as Donin in 1040. The name comes from Property of Doň from the Bohemian first name Zdoň. The town and its castle controlled two roads from Saxony to Bohemia: one through the Müglitz valley, and one over the heights to Kulm. The burgraves of Dohna controlled a large territory between the Margraviate of Meissen and the Kingdom of Bohemia, stretching from Rabenau in the west to Gottleuba in the east. The burgraves of Dohna were defeated in 1402 in the Dohna Feud, and the town was given to vassals of the Wettin Margrave of Meissen. After 1460, when the seat of administration moved to Sonnenstein Castle in Pirna, the castle fell into ruins. In 1587 Fabien I, Burgrave of Dohna, was involved in the French Wars of Religion - commanding Protestant mercenaries which were funded by Elizabeth I of England and the King of Denmark and confronting the Catholic forces of King Henry III of France at the Battle of Vimory. The city of Dohna was devastated by French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars (1813). The primary and secondary school was opened in 1891. It was named after Marie Curie in 1969. In 1994, Köttewitz and Krebs joined Dohna. In 1999, Meusegast and Röhrsdorf joined Dohna. In January 2000, Dohna became the seat of Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Dohna-Müglitztal, which also includes the municipality Müglitztal.

Nagashige was the eldest son of Niwa Nagahide and married the 5th daughter of Oda Nobunaga. He took part in his first campaign in 1583, assisting his father in the battles against Shibata Katsuie. In the Battle of Nagakute, at the age of thirteen, Nagashige led a troop of the Niwa clan in place of his father, who was ill. In 1585, upon Nagahide's death, Nagashige received his father's fief of 1,230,000 koku (spanning Echizen, Wakasa, and parts of Kaga). During the Siege of Toyama against the forces of Sassa Narimasa, Hideyoshi accused the Niwa clan with collaboration, and seized most of their territories, leaving the clan with only Wakasa Province at 150,000 koku. This is believed to have been Hideyoshi's effort to reduce the Niwa clan's strength. During the subsequent Kyūshū Campaign in 1589, one of the Niwa clan retainers was again accused of collaboration with the enemy, and the clan was reduced further to a small 40,000 koku holding around Komatsu in Kaga Province. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was mercurial in his moods, and in response to Nagashige's efforts at the Siege of Odawara, his status was brought back to 120,000 koku. In 1600, at the Battle of Sekigahara, Nagashige took part in Ishida Mitsunari's force and fought against Maeda Toshinaga of Kaga; he consequently had his holdings briefly confiscated. His daimyo status was restored in 1603, when the Tokugawa family granted him 10,000 koku at Futsuto, in Hitachi Province. At the siege of Osaka from 1614 to 1615, Nagashige fought on Tokugawa Ieyasu's side. For his service in battle, he had his stipend increased; his fief was transferred to the Edosaki Domain (20,000 koku). Nagashige was promoted again in 1622 with a move to the Tanagura Domain and a stipend increase to 50,000 koku. His rise culminated in 1627, when he was granted the Shirakawa Domain (worth 100,700 koku) and built Shirakawa Castle. Nagashige's successor was his son, Mitsushige.

ChorusOS started as the Chorus distributed real- time operating system research project at Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique (INRIA) in France in 1979. During the 1980s, Chorus was one of two earliest microkernels (the other being Mach) and was developed commercially by Chorus Systèmes. Over time, development effort shifted away from distribution aspects to real-time for embedded systems. In 1997, Sun Microsystems acquired Chorus Systèmes for its microkernel technology, which went toward the new JavaOS. Sun (and henceforth Oracle) no longer supports ChorusOS. The founders of Chorus Systèmes started a new company called Jaluna in August 2002. Jaluna has subsequently become VirtualLogix. VirtualLogix was itself acquired by Red Bend in September 2010. VirtualLogix designed embedded systems using Linux and ChorusOS (which they called \\"VirtualLogix C5\\"). C5 was described by them as a carrier-grade operating system, and was actively maintained by them. The Red Bend web site shows no trace of current activity around the ChorusOS/VirtualLogix C5 microkernel. The source repository on SourceForge also shows zero sign of activity since July 2007. The latest source tree of ChorusOS, an evolution of version 5.0, was open-sourced by Sun and is available at the Sun Download Center.

N., Carboranes 3rd Ed., Elsevier, Amsterdam and New York (2016) Like many of the related boron hydrides, these clusters are polyhedra or fragments of polyhedra, and are similarly classified as closo-, nido-, arachno-, hypho-, etc. based on whether they represent a complete (closo-) polyhedron, or a polyhedron that is missing one (nido-), two (arachno-), three (hypho-), or more vertices. Carboranes are a notable example of heteroboranes. Carboranes have as few as 5 and as many as 14 atoms in the cage framework (15 if metal atoms are included) are known, but the majority have two cage carbon atoms; of these, the best-known series is that of the closo-C2BnHn+2 systems where n = 3 to 12. However, carboranes having 1 to 6 cage carbon atoms have been prepared, as have a number of carborane mono- and dianions. The icosahedral CB11H12− anion is a strong acid, and its polychlorinated derivative H(CHB11Cl11) is a superacid. The icosahedral charge-neutral closo- carboranes, 1,2-, 1,7-, and 1,12-C2B10H12 (respectively ortho-, meta-, and para-carborane in the informal nomenclature) are particularly stable and are commercially available. These boron-rich clusters exhibit unique organomimetic properties with chemical reactivity matching classical organic molecules, yet are structurally similar to metal-based inorganic and organometallic species The C2B10H12 isomers, together with other carborane clusters and metallacarboranes (see below) are utilized in a wide range of applications including heat-resistant polymers, recovery of radioactive metals from nuclear waste, catalysis, novel electroactive materials, and medical applications. Like other electron-delocalized polyhedral clusters, the electronic structure of these cluster compounds can be described by the Wade–Mingos rules.The Wade- Mingos rules were first stated by Kenneth Wade in 1971 and expanded by Michael Mingos in 1972: They are sometimes known as simply \\"Wade's rules.\\" * As noted above, carboranes are closely related to boron hydrides (boranes), and thus are structurally very different from hydrocarbons, owing to the fact that carbon atoms have one more valence electron than do boron atoms (a notable feature of carboranes is that the cage carbon atoms often are directly bound to as many as 6, or even more, neighboring atoms, quite unlike the hydrocarbons). Carboranes and boranes adopt 3-dimensional cage (cluster) geometries in order to facilitate their electron-delocalized nonclassical bonding, whereas hydrocarbons are typically chains or rings; for example, B4H10 has an arachno cage geometry while the butane isomers n- and iso-C4H10, with 4 more electrons than B4H10, adopt linear or branched chain structures. Examples of nido and arachno- carboranes include 2,3-C2B4H8 and 1,3-C2B7H13, respectively. Geometrical isomers of carboranes can exist, necessitating the use of the numerical prefixes in a compound's name; this is illustrated by the 1,2-, 1,7-, and 1,2-C2B10H12 icosahedral clusters referred to earlier. Preparation Carboranes have been prepared by many different routes, the most common being addition of alkynyl reagents to boron hydride clusters to form dicarbon carboranes. For example, the high-temperature reaction of pentaborane(9) with acetylene affords several closo-carboranes as well as other products: :nido-B5H9 + C2H2 overset{underset{mathrm{500-600C}}{}}{=} closo-1,5-C2B3H5, closo-1,6-C2B4H6, 2,4-C2B5H7 When the reaction is conducted at lower temperatures, an open-cage carborane is obtained: :nido-B5H9 + C2H2 overset{underset{mathrm{200C}}{}}{=} nido-2,4-C2B4H8 Other procedures generate carboranes containing three or four cage carbon atoms (refs. [1],[4],[5]) =Monocarba derivatives= Monocarboranes are clusters with BnC cages. The 12-vertex derivative is best studied, but several are known. Typically they are prepared by the addition of one-carbon reagents to boron hydride clusters. One-carbon reagents include cyanide, isocyanides, and formaldehyde. For example, monocarbadodecaborate ([CB11H12]−) is produced from decaborane and formaldehyde, followed by addition of borane dimethylsulfide. =Dicarba clusters= Dicarbaboranes can be prepared from boron hydrides using alkynes as the source of the two carbon centers. In addition to the closo-C2BnHn+2 series mentioned above, several open-cage dicarbon species are known including nido-C2B3H7 (isostructural and isoelectronic with B5H9) and arachno-C2B7H13. Structure of nido-C2B4H8, highlighting some trends: carbon at the low connectivity sites, bridging hydrogen between B centers on open face. Syntheses of icosahedral closo-dicarbadodecaborane derivatives (R2C2B10H10) employ alkynes as the R2C2 source and decaborane (B10H14) to supply the B10 unit. =Tricarba, tetracarba, pentacarba, and hexacarba clusters= Carboranes having more than two carbon atoms in the skeletal framework, obtained in a variety of ways, include derivatives of nido-C3B3H7, nido-C3B8H11, nido-C4B2H6, nido-C4B4H8, nido-C5BH6+, and arachno-H6C6B6Et6 (reference [1]). =Isomerism= Many dicarbaboranes exist as isomers that differ in the relative location of the carbon centers. In addition to the three previously mentioned icosahedral C2B10H12 compounds, isomerism is also found in some smaller closo-carborane systems, e.g., 1,2- and 1,6-C2B4H6, 2,3- and 2,4-C2B5H7, 1,2- and 1,6-C2B6H8, and 2,3- and 2,4-C2B5H7, as well as in open-cage carboranes such as 2,3- and 2,4-C2B4H8 and 1,2 and 1,3-C2B9H13. In general, isomers having non-adjacent cage carbon atoms are more thermally stable than those with adjacent carbons, so that heating tends to induce mutual separation of the carbon atoms in the framework. This is illustrated by the thermal isomerization of 1,2- to 1,6-C2B4H6 and of 1,2- to 1,7-C2B10H12. Formation of the 1,12-C2B10H12 (para-carborane) isomer requires much higher temperatures (ca. 600C), accompanied by some decomposition (refs. [1], [4], and [5]). Reactions Carboranes undergo a wide variety of reactions. Deprotonation of closo-dicarbadodecaboranes using organolithium reagents gives the dilithio derivatives. :C2B10H12 + 2 BuLi → Li2C2B10H10 + 2 BuH These dilithiated compounds react with a variety of electrophiles, e.g. chlorophosphines, chlorosilanes, and sulfur. Base-induced degradation of carboranes give anionic nido derivatives, which can be employed as ligands for transition metals, generating metallacarboranes, which are carboranes containing one or more transition metal or main group metal atoms in the cage framework, discovered in 1965.Hawthorne, M. F.; Young, D. C.; Wegner, P. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965, 87, 1818 The bulk of the work on metallacarboranes has centered on 12-vertex MC2B9 and M2C2B8 clusters and 7-vertex MC2B4 and M2C2B3 (triple-deckerBeer, D. C.; Miller, V. R.; Sneddon, L.

[1], [4[, and [5]). Diborolyl-metal complexes featuring MC3B2 and M2C3B2 cages, representing another type of metallacarborane, have also been extensively studied Bach, B.; Nie, Y.; Pritzkow, H.; Siebert, W. J. Organomet. Chem. 2004, 689, 429  Research  Dicarbollide complexes have been evaluated for many applications for many years, but commercial applications are rare. The bis(dicarbollide) [Co(C2B9H11)2]− has been used as a precipitant for removal of 137Cs+ from radiowastes. The medical applications of carboranes have been explored. C-functionalized carboranes represent a source of boron for boron neutron capture therapy. Some metal complexes exhibit catalytic properties.

The neighborhood includes the landscape from Railroad Park to the crest of Red Mountain, and from Interstate 65 to U.S. Highway 31 (or \\"Red Mountain Expressway\\"). It is one of the most densely populated residential neighborhoods in the city and home to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospitals, the state's second-largest employer. The Birmingham Business Journal anticipated Southside to have the highest income growth of any zip code in the metro area. Characteristics Southside is one of the most cosmopolitan neighborhoods in Birmingham, and was historically known for its counterculture. Five Points South in particular has long been a popular nightlife and entertainment district. Because of the international draw of UAB, Southside is the most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood in Birmingham and is also considered one of its main \\"gayborhoods\\", playing host to the city's annual gay pride parade each June. With its college town atmosphere, the community has a high percentage of bicycle commuters, and according to walkscore.com, has two of the top three most walkable zip code neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. Southside has several local businesses, and many residents are employed in the medical, research, and banking industries that anchor Birmingham's economy, or at one of the law firms located in Five Points South. George Ward Park, Vulcan Trail, Magic City Rotary trail, and Railroad Park afford residents with opportunities for outdoor recreation and scenic views. The Vulcan statue, Birmingham's city symbol, crowns the crest of Red Mountain and is visible from most areas of the neighborhood. Other attractions include Good People Brewery, Dreamland Bar-B- Que, the Frank Fleming Storyteller Fountain, the Alys Stephens Center and the Regions Field baseball stadium. History Much of Southside was established in the 1890s by John Phelan and Robert Jemison Sr. (of the South-Side Land Co. and the Jemison Real Estate & Insurance Co., respectively) as a leafy streetcar suburb for Birmingham's middle and upper class residents similar to Atlanta's Inman Park neighborhood. The proximity of UAB and the magnet school Ramsay High School stabilized the community during white flight in the late 20th century, and the area continues to maintain some of the lowest crime rates in the city. As one of Birmingham's oldest residential neighborhoods, it has recently experienced a revival in demand for housing options with historic character, as well as the construction of new apartments and condominiums. The neighborhood contains seven historic districts subject to design review under the neighborhood association subcommittee; these districts include an eclectic mix of houses built between 1890 and 1920, primarily representing the Prairie, Craftsman, Neoclassical, and Victorian styles, with a few examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival. The network of sidewalks, tree-lined streets and rear-access alleys recently served as a conceptual model for the new urbanism community of Mt. Laurel located thirty minutes south by car. Southside residents have organized into three neighborhood associations (Five Points South, Glen Iris, and Southside) which meet monthly. Most residences are within city council district 3, currently served by Councilor Valerie Abbott, though district 5 and 6 are also represented.

The Torino was built on the same hybrid AMC platform all the way through 1981 in both two-door hardtop and four-door sedan variants. It has been called Argentina's national car.  Story  220x220px In 1961, IKA (Industrias Kaiser Argentina) was looking for a car that could break into the Argentinian market, a car that could combine American reliability with European elegance. They had the idea of delivering two 1965 Rambler American (a coupe hardtop and a sedan) to Pininfarina for a complete redesign. The new design largely maintained the general shape of the original Rambler but with a completely new interior and a redesign grill and rear.. Rear view The car was presented on November 30, 1966 at the Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez, and was marketed as the quintessential Argentinian car. The Torino proved wildly popular throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, continued to be produced even after the bankruptcy of IKA, which was sold to Renault in 1975. Renault continued the production until the early 1980's. In 1978 the local automobile market began to slow down considerably and this also coincided with the relaxation of trade restrictions and the introduction of foreign made cars to the Argentine market. The Torino was unable to compete with the newer cheaper more reliable foreign models. Renault decided to shut down the Torino production line on December 1981.  Engines  All engines were manufactured in Argentina. :*Tornado Special engine (only available on the 300/300S (4 doors): ::* Bore X Stroke: 84.94 mm x 87.31 mm ::* Displacement: 2968 cc ::* Top RPM: 5000 rpm ::* Number of main bearings: 4 :::* Power: at 4500 rpm and at 3000 rpm IKA Torino TS sedan :*Tornado Interceptor engine (Available models 380, 380W, TS, SE, GS200): ::* Bore X Stroke: 84.94 mm X 111.125 mm ::* Displacement: 3770 cc ::* Top RPM: 5000 rpm ::*Number of main bearings: 4 :::* Power: :::* 380/380S: at 4300 rpm and at 3500 rpm (380S is the 4 door Version) :::* 380W: at 4500 rpm and at 3500 rpm (The W is for the 3 weber 45 Dcoe 17 carburetors) :::* TS: at 4500 rpm and at 2500 rpm :::* TS/S: at 4200 rpm and at 2500 rpm (4 door) :::* GS200: at 4700 rpm and at 3500 rpm *(The GS200 replaced the 380W and was the first Argentine car to be able to exceed 200 km/h, with a top speed of 203 km/h) 1972 Renault Torino :*The Torino 233 engine featuring a new block with 7 main bearings and a new cylinder head (Available models SE, GR, TS, TSX, GS, ZX). ::* Bore X Stroke: 84.94 mm x 111.125 mm ::* Displacement: 3770 cc ::* Top RPM: 5200 rpm ::* Number of main bearings: 7 :::* Power: :::* SE (4-door): at 4500 rpm and at 2500 rpm :::* GR (4-door)/TS: at 4500 rpm and at 2500 rpm :::* TSX: at 4500 rpm and at 3000 rpm :::* GS: at 4700 rpm and at 3200 rpm (estimated) :::* ZX: at 4500 rpm and at 3000 rpm :*The Tornado Interceptor 241 engine: prepared for use in competition only available in the Torino 380W TC: ::* Bore X Stroke: 86.70 mm x 111.125 mm ::* Displacement: 3950 cc ::* Top RPM: 5400 rpm ::* Number of main bearings: 4 :::* Power: at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm  Racing  TA Torino in the Juan Manuel Fangio Museum The IKA Torino's most notable international success was in the 84-hour Nürburgring race of 1969, with a Torino finishing in fourth place. The factory shipped three cars to Germany and after the three and a half days of racing, the No. 3 Torino driven by Eduardo Copello, Alberto Rodriguez Larreta, and Oscar Mauricio Franco, had covered the most laps of all - 334, but lost the top position because they accumulated various penalties during the race. The IKA Torino became \\"the pride and joy of Argentine car enthusiasts\\" when their country's team \\"showed that it could run with the best of Europe on Europe’s toughest circuit.\\" The No. 3 car is displayed in the Juan Manuel Fangio Museum located in Balcarce, Buenos Aires Province, the birthplace of Argentina's Juan Manuel Fangio who dominated the first decade of Formula One racing. The IKA Torino won the Turismo Carretera, a popular touring car racing series in Argentina in 1967 with Eduardo Copello, 1969 with Gastón Perkins, 1970 and 1971 with Rubén Luis di Palma. The Torino is still being raced, albeit in silhouette form with Jeep Cherokee engines, in the Argentinian Turismo Carretera, TC4000, and Turismo Zonal categories.  Legacy  By the late 1970s the Torino was the only non-Renault product manufactured by the French company. It could also be considered the last front-engine, rear wheel drive Renault, a rarity in itself. Many Argentines think of the Torino as the national car. Parts are still available and there are fan clubs.

It is found in freshwater and brackish habitats in western Eurasia. It is a popular game fish and has been introduced to a variety of localities outside its native range. It is the type species of the genus Sander. Taxonomy The zander was first formally described in 1758 as Perca lucioperca by Carolus Linnaeus in volume 1 of the tenth edition of Systema Naturae and he gave the type locality as \\"European lakes\\". When Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) created the genus Sander he made Perca lucioperca its type species. The zander is part of the European clade within the genus Sander which split from a common ancestor with the North American clade, which the walleye (S. vitreus) and the sauger (S. canadensis) belong to, around 20.8 million years ago. Within the European clade the Volga pikeperch (S. volgaensis) is the most basal taxon and shares features with the North American clade, such as being a broadcast spawner. In contrast in the zander and the estuarine perch (S. marinus) the males build nests and the female spawn into these nests and the males then guard the eggs and fry. The lineage leading to the zander is thought to have diverged from the common ancestor with the Volga pikeperch circa 13.8 million years ago while the split from the estuarine perch took place around 9.1 million years ago. Description The zander is the largest member of the Percidae and it has a long, muscular body which bears some resemblance to a Northern pike (Esox lucius), hence the alternative English common name of pikeperch. Its upper part of the body is green-brown in colour and this extends onto the sides as dark vertical bars, in a pattern not dissimilar to that of the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) while the lower part of the body is creamy- white. The caudal fin is dark and the pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are paler off-white in colour. The dorsal and caudal fins are marked with rows of black spots on the membranes between the spines and rays, these are largest and most obvious on the first dorsal fin. The juveniles are silvery in colour, becoming darker as the age. They have powerful jaws which are armed with many sharp teeth with tow long canines in the front of each jaw. They have large bulbous eyes which are opaque when the fish is living in particularly turbid conditions, an adaptation to low light. There is a single flat spine on the operculum. Like other members of the perch family the zander has a split dorsal fin with the first dorsal fin having 13 - 20 spines and 18-24 soft rays, while the anal fin has 2-3 rays and 10 - 14 soft rays. The caudal fin is long and forked. The zander has a maximum published standard length of , although they are more commonly found at around . This species can reach \\"International Angling Rules\\" (IGFA) Accessed 19 November 2008) of weight, although typical catches are considerably smaller. The IGFA All-Tackle world record zander was caught in Lago Maggiore, Switzerland in June 2016 weighing . Zander reach an average length of with a maximum length of . Distribution The zander is very widely distributed across Eurasia, occurring in the drainages of the Caspian, Baltic, Black, Aral, North and Aegean Sea basins. Its northern distribution limit is Finland. It has been introduced to Great Britain, southern Europe, and continental Europe west of the Elbe, Ebro, Tagus and Jucar drainages, as well as to Anatolia, North Africa, Siberia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. In the UK, zander were originally introduced in 1878 by Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford, into lakes on his Woburn Abbey estate and soon after that into the Great Ouse Relief Channel in The Fens. British Waterways included zander among a \\"dirty dozen\\" non-native species most likely to harm native wildlife along rivers in Great Britain. Their success in establishing themselves is owed to a number of factors, one of which is that they are particularly well adapted to life in the slow-flowing, sparsely vegetated, rather murky waters that comprise so many of the British lowland rivers.\\"Foreign Fishes\\", The Living Countryside magazine (issue 36), p.706 Zander thrive in water with rather low visibility, unlike pike, which often dominate the predator fish niche in clear water. However, zander need plenty of oxygen and soon disappear from eutrophic areas. Habitat and biology =Habitat= Zander inhabit freshwater bodies, preferentially large rivers and eutrophic lakes. They tolerate brackish water and will make use of coastal lakes and estuaries. Individuals living in brackish water habitats migrate upriver, as far as for spawning. =Diet= Zander are carnivorous and the adults feed on smaller schooling fish. Studies around the Baltic Sea have found them to prey on the European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), European perch, vendace (Coregonus albula) and the common roach (Rutilus rutilus), They were also found to be cannibalistic on smaller zanders. They have also been recorded feedong on smolts of sea trout (Salmo trutta morph. trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In the United Kingdom zander thrive in canals where the water is turbid due to the boat traffic and although their favoured prey in these waters is common roach they have a high impact on the populations of gudgeon (Gobio gobio). =Reproduction= The zander spawns over gravel in flowing water, the males defend a territory in which they dig shallow depressions in sand or gravel which are roughly across and in depth in sand or gravel. They will also nest among exposed plant roots and the eggs are laid onto these roots. The nests are normally at depths of in turbid water. Spawning takes place in pairs, at night and at daybreak. When they are spawning the female is stationary above the male's nest and the male rapdliy swims around her, keeping a distance of around from the nesting depression. The male then orients himdself perpindicular to the substrate and the pair swim around swiftly, releasing the eggs and sperm. The female departs the after releasing her eggs. The male remains at the nest and defends it, fanning the eggs using the pectoral fins. Each female lays all of her eggs at once and only spawns once a year. The larvae are attracted to light and after they leave the nest they feed on zooplankton and small pelagic animals. They normal spawning season is in April and May, although exceptionally they may spawn from late February through to July, and the actual periond depends on latitude and altitude. The determining factor is that it needs temperatures to reach before spawning starts. =Life history= Zander has a maximum lifespan of 17 year and they are sexually mature at 3-10 years old, with 4 years old being typical. =Parasites and predators= The zander is host to a large number parasites among which is the nematode Anisakis which infects their gastro-intestinal tract and which can infect humans if the fish is smoked, fried or otherwise cooked at temperatures lower than . There are a large number of known parasites of the zander which affect the skin, eyes and internal organs. The zander is known to be a vector of the trematode Bucephalus polymorphus which it may pass to native cyrinids and this may have resulted in decreases in the populations of these fishes in some French river systems during the 1960s and 1970s. More recently the primary host of B. polymorphus, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has invaded many drainages in Europe. The recorded predators of the zander include other zanders, as well as European eels (Anguilla anguilla), Northern pike, European perch, the wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and the Caspian seal (Phoca caspia). Use by humans Whole baked zander served in a restaurant in Balatonfüred, Hungary. The zander is considered one of the most valuable food fish native to Europe. It is esteemed for its light, firm but tender meat with few bones and a delicate flavour. Although it is not generally bred for food, its adaptability makes zander fishery quite sustainable. Indeed, in some regions release of young zanders is restricted, as natural stocks already provide a sufficient supply for the market, while boosting the population of this large predator would have an adverse effect on the zander's food fishes. Zander is especially well suited for fish fillets. It can also be served whole, baked, smoked or cooked. In some culinary circles, zander is appreciated even more highly than salmon. Even the offals can be cooked into consommé. In 2004, it was revealed that some restaurants in the Minneapolis- St. Paul area of Minnesota in the United States were serving imported zander instead of the closely related North American walleye (the state fish, and a popular food in the region). While zander and walleye are almost indistinguishable by taste, the restaurants were selling the European fish under the name \\"walleye\\", which is an illegal practice. An investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed. In Ohio many restaurants were caught using juvenile Zander fillets in the 40 to 80 gram range in place of Lake Erie Yellow Perch. Shortages on the availability of Perch along with skyrocketing prices caused wholesalers and restaurants to use the juvenile Zander also known as Pike Perch fillets. In Poland, this fish is popular and regarded as a delicacy, but the difficulty in catching it makes it expensive. It is most commonly baked with a trace of butter. In the Serbian province of Vojvodina, zander has a long tradition in the local cuisine and is considered to be a delicacy. Its usually served baked or fried in a batter along with lemon sauce and potato and onion salad. In Finland, as a conservation measure, the law regulates the minimum size of zander considered mature enough to be eaten. Zander is popular for its taste and its tendency to be picky with its prey, making it harder to catch than many other fish. Zander also tend to chase their prey before striking. When striking a fishing lure, it fights by pulling backwards, giving the impression that there is a big stone attached to the fishing line. Because the zander is not as good in striking as the pike, it prefers slower, even wounded fish; a lure moving too fast will not catch the zander's attention. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that zander do not attack lures that are moving too slowly either. In July 2009 in Switzerland, a zander attacked tourists in Lake Maggiore, sending two people to the emergency room; the worst cut inflicted was about 10 centimeters long. The 70-cm 8-kg fish was later caught by the local police who cooked it and offered it to the tourists for the trouble it caused. It is very unusual for zander to attack humans. As the largest member of the perch family the zander is a popular game fish but as it is legally a non-native invasive species in the United Kingdom any zander taken by anglers there must not be returned and should be killed.

The Olympic Village was demolished after the Summer Olympic Games. * On December 14, 1963, a crack appeared in the Baldwin Hills Dam impounding the Baldwin Hills Reservoir. Within a few hours, water rushing through the crack eroded the earthen dam, gradually widening the crack until the dam failed catastrophically at 3:38 pm. When the crack was discovered, police with bullhorns urged the evacuation of the area, but 6 people were killed. 200 homes were completely wiped out, and an additional 1500 to 2000 houses and apartment buildings were damaged, and most of Baldwin Vista and the historic Village Green community were flooded. The dam's failure was ultimately determined to be the result of subsidence, caused by overexploitation of the Inglewood Oil Field. The dam's failure prompted the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to close and drain other small local reservoirs with similar designs, such as the Silver Lake Reservoir. The Baldwin Hills Dam was not rebuilt—instead, the empty reservoir was demolished, filled with earth, landscaped, and converted to Kenneth Hahn Regional Park. * During the summer of 1985, a brush fire along La Brea Avenue spread up the canyon towards the homes along Don Carlos Drive in Baldwin Hills Estates.

Career Dupuis at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival Dupuis is a celebrity in French-speaking areas of Canada and is also well known in anglophone areas due to his English- language and bilingual projects. He has performed in many theater productions, movies, and television series. Among the stage roles that he has performed so far are: Luc in Michel Marc Bouchard's Les Muses orphelines (The Orphan Muses), directed by André Brassard in 1985; Roméo in a Québécois adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (Roméo et Juliette), directed by Guillermo de Andrea in 1989; and Jay in Jean-Marc Dalpé's Le Chien (The Dog), Adrien in Jeanne-Mance Delisle's Un Oiseau vivant dans la gueule (A Live Bird in Its Jaws), and Lee in a Québécois version of Sam Shepard's True West, all three productions directed by Brigitte Haentjens, in 1987-89, 1990, and 1994, respectively. Dupuis gained popularity in Quebec as Ovila Pronovost in the series Les Filles de Caleb (also known as Emilie) when it premiered on Radio- Canada (1990–92), and he co-starred as the journalist Michel Gagné in four seasons of Scoop (1991–95). He was introduced to the American public on television as Oliva Dionne in Million Dollar Babies (1994)--Les jumelles Dionne: La véritable histoire tragique des quintuplées Dionne (The Dionne \\"Twins\\": The True Tragic Story of the Dionne Quintuplets). In the United States, he also debuted on the big screen in such film roles as Becker in Screamers (1995) and as John Strauss in Bleeders (1996), also known as Hemoglobin (1997) in the UK. In 1997 he began appearing as Michael Samuelle in the television series La Femme Nikita, also known as Nikita. Recently, he won a MetroStar Award for his role as Ross Desbiens in Le Dernier Chapitre: La Vengeance (2003), the sequel to Le Dernier Chapitre (2002), both filmed simultaneously in dual-language versions broadcast in French and English on Radio-Canada and the CBC, respectively. Dupuis's first appearance on film was in a 1987 short experimental work inspired by the 1926 avant-garde film Anémique Cinéma, by Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, featuring the same title.Prod.

(Full clips of the film, providing these production details, are accessible on the internet via a variety of fansites.) Among Dupuis' film performances are Yves, in Being at Home with Claude (1991; Cannes, Un Certain Regard 1992)--his first major screen role--directed by Jean Beaudin, adapted from a screenplay by Johanne Boisvert, based on the 1986 stage play by René-Daniel Dubois; and Kevin Barlow, in Manners of Dying (2004), the first feature film directed by Jeremy Peter Allen, adapted from his own screenplay based on the short story first published in the 1993 collection The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios and Other Stories by Yann Martel. His performance as Alexandre Tourneur in Looking for Alexander (Mémoires affectives) (2004), directed by Francis Leclerc, who co-wrote the screenplay with Marcel Beaulieu, received awards. In The Rocket (Maurice Richard), directed by Charles Binamé (Séraphin: Heart of Stone) and released in late November 2005, Dupuis stars as French-Canadian ice hockey icon Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard, who played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1942–60, and whom he portrayed previously on Canadian television in 1997 and 1999. Dupuis' own experience playing hockey and his ability to perform on the ice on authentic period hockey skates were useful for this film, in which several professional hockey players were cast in supporting roles. The film was nominated for the Jutra Award 2006 in fourteen categories, including Dupuis for Best Actor, but he did not win it. Leading the nominations for a Genie Award in thirteen categories, it won nine of the twenty-two awards on February 13, 2007, at the Carlu Event Theatre in Toronto, including Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Dupuis.Marise Strauss, \\"Rocket Sweeps Genies – Almost\\", Playback, February 13, 2007; accessed February 14, 2007.Peter Howell, 'Rocket' Scores Genies Triple Hat Trick: The Rocket Scores Nine Genies, But Bon Cop, Bad Cop Takes Best Picture\\", The Toronto Star; accessed February 14, 2007.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1977 until 2000, the last 16 years of which were at Coventry City. He holds the record at Coventry for the most appearances as a player at 601 in all competitions (507 in the league) and he played in the winning FA Cup team of 1987. He also played for Chesterfield, Liverpool and Shrewsbury Town. Playing career He started his professional career at Chesterfield before moving to Liverpool. His time at Liverpool was frustrating as he was unable to displace Ray Clemence. On his debut against Derby County on 8 March 1978, he conceded 4 goals. He managed a few more team appearances before moving to Shrewsbury Town. In 1984 he joined Coventry for £72,500.

In 16 seasons at Coventry, he collected an FA Cup winner's medal, but never played in European competition (Coventry were unable to qualify for the European Cup Winners' Cup due to the ban on English teams in European competition following the Heysel Disaster of 1985) and the highest position Coventry attained in this period was seventh in the 1988–89 First Division. On no fewer than seven occasions in Ogrizovic's time at the club, they came close to relegation from the top flight. They were finally relegated from the Premier League one season after his retirement. Ogrizovic is also one of the very few goalkeepers to have scored from open play, the goal coming in a 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday in the Football League First Division on 12 October 1986. It was the only goal he ever scored in a competitive game.Mann, Mantej (2016-10-25). Coventry City digest: 30 years since Steve Ogrizovic scored from a goal-kick and Sky Blues U23s win again.

Overall, he made 604 professional league appearances in a playing career spanning 23 years from 1977 to 2000. His final appearance for Coventry came on 6 May 2000 against Sheffield Wednesday. The keeper had not been first choice for much of that season, alternating the number 1 position with Magnus Hedman, but was awarded the jersey for the club's final home game in recognition of his outstanding service to the club. International career During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ogrizovic was generally considered to be the best goalkeeper never to have won a full England cap. Although frequently considered for selection during this period by a number of England managers including Bobby Robson and Graham Taylor, he was never selected for the full squad. He was once considered to be selected for the Yugoslavian national side (due to his Yugoslavian parentage), in the late eighties, but he declined the offer. Coaching career During the Iain Dowie era, Ogrizovic was the manager of the Coventry City Reserve Team and he continued to hold this under Chris Coleman. He was also caretaker manager in conjunction with Brian Borrows at the end of the 2001–02 season, between Roland Nilsson's departure and Gary McAllister's appointment.

Nicknamed the \\"Jewel of the Kawarthas,\\" it has a population of 1,800 permanent inhabitants, which swells in the summer due to tourism and cottaging. Fenelon Falls is home to lock 34 on the Trent-Severn Waterway between Sturgeon Lake and Cameron Lake. It is primarily a tourist town and therefore is most active during the summer season. The main street of Fenelon Falls is called Colborne Street. The eponymous falls are hidden from plain view, because the main road crosses over the river just upstream; however, the falls are easily viewed from a nearby restaurant or from a path on the north band of the Fenelon River. The falls power a hydro-electric dam, which diverts some of the water flow. History Fenelon Falls' main street Fenelon Falls, originally named Cameron's Falls, was renamed after the township, which was named after François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, not to be confused with his more famous half-brother of the same name), who founded a mission on the Bay of Quinté. The village of Fenelon Falls was incorporated in 1874. In 1876, the Victoria Railway reached Fenelon Falls. This line was taken over by the Midland Railway of Canada circa 1880, then absorbed into the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1893. In 1885, construction of the lock between Cameron and Sturgeon lake began. In 1923, CN took over the former GTR, operating the line until the burning of McLaren's Creek bridge near Lindsay in 1980 cut off the north end of the Haliburton Subdivision. In 1983, the line was abandoned with the track being removed by 1984. The line eventually became a public multi-use trail.

Walker State Park Laura S. Walker State Park is a 626-acre (2.53 km²) Georgia state park located near Hoboken and the Okefenokee Swamp. The park is named after Laura S. Walker, a Georgia writer, teacher, civic leader, and naturalist (she is most famous for the latter). The park's location near the Okefenokee makes it home to many exotic plant and animal species, including alligators, great blue herons, and pitcher plants. The park includes a 120-acre (0.49 km²) lake and a championship 18-hole golf course plus pro shop. History In the 1930s an effort was made to recognize Waycross, Georgia conservationist Laura S. Walker for her work promoting forestry and other civic activities. At the urging of Georgia's Senators, President Franklin D Roosevelt issued a proclamation to establish the Laura S Walker National Park in her honor. She was the only living person for whom a state or national park was named. In 1937, the federal government purchased distressed farmland for the park under a Federal land utilization program authorized by the Bankhead- Jones Farm Tenant Act. Work on the park was undertaken by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1941, the national park was deeded over to Georgia, becoming the State's 13th state park.

He was adopted as the head of the Kanbe clan, which ruled the middle region of Ise Province and so he was also called Kanbe Nobutaka (神戸信孝). Biography Nobutaka was born as the third son of Oda Nobunaga and he was called San Shichi (三七), possibly because he was born on the seventh day of the third month, in the Japanese lunar calendar system. His mother was a concubine named Sakashi (坂氏). A theory has it that Nobutaka was actually born twenty days earlier than Nobunaga's second son Oda Nobukatsu but it was reported later than Nobukatsu's birth to Nobunaga and thus he was acknowledged as the third son. According to this theory, it is also believed that the low status of his mother's parents had played a factor as well. In 1568, after Nobunaga controlled Ise Province, Nobutaka was installed as the head of the Kanbe clan, whose seat was Kanbe Castle, near present-day Suzuka, Mie. The next year, his elder brother, Nobukatsu, became an adopted member of the Kitabatake clan, and ruled a much larger area of southern Ise Province. Nobutaka was reported by missionaries to have a better character than the older Nobukatsu but was ranked lower and held less area than he did. In 1582, Nobutaka was commanded to lead an army against Shikoku and had such retainers as Niwa Nagahide and Tsuda Nobusumi, who was the son of Nobunaga's younger brother Nobuyuki, under his command. While readying his army to cross the sea at Sakai, Nobunaga died at Honnō-ji during an attack by Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobutaka turned back and at Osaka, killed Nobusumi, who was married to a daughter of Mitsuhide. While Nobutaka's suspicion did make some sense, no evidence had turned up that would connect Nobusumi to Mitsuhide. Nobutaka then joined Hashiba Hideyoshi who had turned back from his own campaign, and they fought the Akechi forces at the Battle of Yamazaki. Nobutaka and his brother Oda Nobukatsu then quarreled over Nobunaga's succession at a council held in Kiyosu Castle. Sanpōshi was then declared heir. Nobutaka gained Mino Province where the eldest son, Oda Nobutada had ruled before his death by Mitsuhide, but this was still far short of what he had hoped to gain. He later allied with Shibata Katsuie and Takigawa Kazumasu to start a war against Hideyoshi, but while Nobutaka was surrounded at Gifu Castle by Nobukatsu, Katsuie lost the Battle of Shizugatake and Nobutaka surrendered. Nobutaka was sent to Daimidoji at Noma, Chita county, in Owari Province where Minamoto no Yoshitomo had been assassinated at the end of the Heian period. Under pressure from Hideyoshi and Nobukatsu, he committed suicide. Two dates, June 19 and June 21 are given for his death. His waka composed before dying was as follows: :昔より 主を討つ身の 野間なれば ::Mukashi yori Shuu o Utsu Mi no Noma nareba :報いを待てや 羽柴筑前 ::Mukui o Mateya Hashiba Chikuzen It is a vengeful poem that would be translated as, You had killed the one you had served / may the gods strike you down, Hashiba Hideyoshi.

In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more resource management objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system. Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge. This approach has more recently been employed in implementing international development programs. Objectives There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including: * Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales * Management retains a focus on statistical power and controls * Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus * Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives * Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future stakeholders. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain political openness, but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a scientific and social process. It must focus on the development of new institutions and institutional strategies in balance with scientific hypothesis and experimental frameworks (resilliance.org). Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not. In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied. Features Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are: *Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned) *Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning) *Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi- model inference *Bayesian inference *Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making: * data collection is never completely implemented * data are collected but not analyzed * data are analyzed but results are inconclusive * data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers * data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors History The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the Yap people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high population densities in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal mangrove depressions and seagrass meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997). The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of scientific management pioneered by Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term \\"adaptive management\\" evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann et al. 1999) Two ecologists at The University of British Columbia, C.S. Holling and C.J Walters further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. Kai Lee, notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC Berkeley. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna, Austria, while C.S. Holling was director of the Institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active. Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, Australia and North America, initially applied in fishery management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the mallard. Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP)Biodiversity Support Program in 1989. BSP was a USAID-funded consortium of WWFWWF The Nature Conservancy (TNC),The Nature Conservancy and World Resources Institute (WRI).World Resources Institute Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects. When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of SuccessFoundations of Success (FOS, a non- profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs. The approaches used included Conservation by DesignConservation by Design (TNC) and Measures of SuccessMeasures of Success (FOS). In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)Conservation Measures Partnership – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs. Use in environmental practices Applying adaptive management in a conservation project or program involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are: *Testing assumptions is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and- error process. Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true. *Adaptation involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience. *Learning is about explicitly documenting a team's planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community. This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered. Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated. Application to environmental projects and programs Figure 1: CMP Adaptive Management Cycle Open Standards for the Practice of ConservationOpen Standards for the Practice of Conservation lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1). The Open Standards represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community. Since the release of the initial Open Standards (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these Open Standards to their work. In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards. Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include: wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from overfishing (FOS, 2007) and climate change (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow: *In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects; *In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries. *Between 1999–2004, FOS worked for WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people. *The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States. *The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington. *In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) according to adaptive management process. *Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the Science for Active Management (SAM)Science for Active Management Program. In international development The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to international development programming.Rondinell, D. A. (1993) Development Projects as Policy Experiments: an adaptive approach to development administration, 2nd ed, Routledge, London and New York This has often been a recognition to the \\"wicked\\" nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes.Ramalingam, B., Laric, M. and Primrose, J.

One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning. This is reflected in international development approaches such as Doing Development Differently, Politically Informed Programming and Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation.Andrews, M., Pritchett, L. and Woolcock, M.

CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies \\"which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better\\" when examined against those which focus less on those practices. CLA integrates three closely connected concepts within the organizational theory literature: namely collaborating, learning and adapting. There is evidence of the benefits of collaborating internally within an organization and externally with organizations. Much of the production and transmission of knowledge—both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge—occurs through collaboration.For example: Polanyi, Michael (1966), The tacit dimension.

Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking sustainability solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions. The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies. Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, & Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This \\"learning to manage by managing to learn\\" (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy. Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the parallel to adaptive management practices, \\"with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability\\" (Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2000). By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), \\"active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options\\" (p. 1121). In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, \\"conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options\\"(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p. 1121).  Effectiveness  It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation. One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game. The students on average performed poorly in comparison to the computer programs implementing passive adaptive management. Collaborative adaptive management is often celebrated as an effective way to deal with natural resource management under high levels of conflict, uncertainty and complexity. The effectiveness of these efforts can be constrained by both social and technical barriers. As the case of the Glenn Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program in the US illustrates, effective collaborative adaptive management efforts require clear and measurable goals and objectives, incentives and tools to foster collaboration, long-term commitment to monitoring and adaptation, and straightforward joint fact- finding protocols. In Colorado, USA, a ten-year, ranch-scale (2590 ha) experiment began in 2012 at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Central Plains Experimental range to evaluate the effectiveness and process of collaborative adaptive management on rangelands. The Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management or “CARM” project monitors outcomes from yearling steer grazing management on 10, 130 ha pastures conducted by a group of conservationists, ranchers, and public employees, and researchers. This team compares ecological monitoring data tracking profitability and conservation outcomes with outcomes from a “traditional” management treatment: a second set of ten pastures managed without adaptive decision making but with the same stocking rate. Early evaluations of the project by social scientists offer insights for more effective adaptive management. First, trust is primary and essential to learning in adaptive management, not a side benefit. Second, practitioners cannot assume that extensive monitoring data or large-scale efforts will automatically facilitate successful collaborative adaptive management. Active, long-term efforts to build trust among scientists and stakeholders are also important. Finally, explicit efforts to understand, share and respect multiple types of manager knowledge, including place-based ecological knowledge practiced by local managers, is necessary to manage adaptively for multiple conservation and livelihood goals on rangelands. Practitioners can expect adaptive management to be a complex, non-linear process shaped by social, political and ecological processes, as well as by data collection and interpretation.

A gendarmerie lieutenant, his parents wanted him to become a priest but he ran away from the seminary and enlisted in the 16e régiment de dragons of Orléans on 7 May 1785. His first marriage with Marie-Jeanne Rémond (born in Montbard on 23 February 1779) gave birth to a daughter, Denise, on 9 March 1800 but his wife died three months later. He married his second wife during his stay in the Department of Montenotte (now the Province of Cuneo), Laure Davico (born 2 August 1782), on 3 June 1806 in Ceva. After the birth of Louis, the eldest, in 1807, a second son, Jean Balthazar, was born on 17 July 1808.Fernand Rude, Aloysius Bertrand, P. Seghers, 1971, Voir la chronologie de Gaspard de la Nuit, présentation de Jacques Bony, Garnier-Flammarion, 2005, . On 15 March 1812 Georges was appointed as gendarmerie captain in Spoleto, whose mayor was at the time Pierre-Louis Roederer. There, on 23 December, the poet's sister Isabella- Caroline (or Elizabeth) was born. On 3 September 1814 he was assigned to Mont- de-Marsan, where he made the acquaintance of Charles Jean Harel, then-prefect of the Department of Landes. Retiring at the end of August 1815, he left Landes and moved to Dijon, where on 19 March 1816 his fourth child was born, Charles Frédéric (who later became a journalist),Chronologie de Gaspard de la nuit, présentation de Max Milner, Garnier-Flammarion, 2005, . and where his daughter Denise from his first marriage got married on 11 January 1818. =A young romantic= Louis Bertrand studied from 1818 to 1826 at the collège royal of Dijon, where he spent most of his life. Among his classmates were Lacordaire and Antoine Tenant de Latour, who would help him later. While in Dijon, Louis Bertrand developed an interest in the Burgundian capital. His father died on 27 February 1828 and he had to sustain the home on his own, receiving financial help from his aunt François-Marguerite also known as “Lolotte”. In the local literary paper “Le Provincial”, which had published the first verses of poet Alfred de Musset, he promoted his avant-garde aesthetic views and published around twenty works in prose and in verse. Still in 1828, it seems he loved an anonymous young girl who might have died, traces of her existence can be found throughout Bertrand's entire works.Henri Corbat, Hantise et imagination chez Aloysius Bertrand, José Corti, 1975, =First trip to Paris and return to Dijon= Encouraged by a laudatory letter from Hugo following a poem published in the journal that he had dedicated to him and by recognition from Sainte-Beuve, he moved to Paris at the beginning of November 1828. He met Sainte-Beuve at the salon of Émile Deschamps and read some of his prose to him. But he felt ashamed of his social status and could not find a place among the Parisian romantics. He got sick in January 1829 and during Spring found a publisher, Sautelet, to publish his poems, but he went bankrupt in August.Jean Bonnerot, Bibliographie de l'œuvre de Sainte-Beuve, L. Giraud-Badin, 1952, . He then got interested in the theater and offered a play to the Vaudeville without success. After that, he decided to return to Dijon on 4 April 1830 and collaborated to the “Spectateur”, a newly-founded liberal newspaper. On 15 February 1831, under the name “Ludovic Bertrand”, he became chief editor of the newspaper “Patriote de la Côte-d’Or” until December 1832, in which he displayed his republican opinions with virulenceFernand Rude, Aloysius Bertrand, P. Seghers, 1971, , and =Final years in Paris= In January 1833, he went back to Paris. Soon after, the publisher Eugène Renduel agreed to publish “Gaspard”, announcing even it would come out in October. He became a secretary for baron Roederer. He wrote “Peter Waldeck ou la chute d’un homme”, a play with chants in 3 acts and 6 tableaux inspired by the “Adventures of Martin Waldeck” by Walter Scott. In Spring of 1834, he met Célestine F., to which he proposed. According to Jacques Bony, his mother did not agree to the union, according to Max Milner his love was one-sided. Between 1835 and 1837, he was in serious financial difficulties and had to borrow money from a lot of people. He contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to Notre-Dame de la Pitié on 18 September 1838 where he remained until 13 May 1839 before being transferred to l’hôpital Saint-Antoine where he stayed until 24 November. In October 1839, a publisher had agreed to publish “Gaspard de la Nuit” and even printed flyers announcing its upcoming publication but the project never came to end while Bertrand was alive. In 1840, he believed he was cured of the disease and started to write verse again. He tried at last to contact the publisher in hopes of finally publishing his manuscript on 5 October, but the publisher had stopped his activity. cemetery of Montparnasse in Paris, section 10. Sickness forced him to go back to the hospital on 11 March 1841. He died there in the morning on 29 April 1841. His close family, mother and sister, did not come to the hospital, nor did they attend his funeral. His mother died in 1854. =Posterity= Cover of the first edition of Gaspard de la nuit. “Gaspard de la Nuit” was finally published in November 1842. It sold 20 copies. However, this edition was full of mistakes due to an inaccurate copy of the manuscript. In 1925, Bertrand Guégan published a new edition from an original manuscript that corrected most of the mistakes. It is only in 1992, when an original calligraphed manuscript was acquired by the Bibliothèque nationale, that the book could be published accordingly to the will of its author, with accurate display of the text and illustrations. In 1862, Charles Baudelaire admitted in a letter he was deeply influenced by Bertrand's work when writing “Spleen de Paris.Charles Baudelaire, Lettre à Arsène Houssaye, Noël 1861, Correspondance, tome II, éd Cl. Pichois, Gallimard, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 1973, . Théodore de Banville, an admirer and later rival of Baudelaire, also quoted Bertrand as a main inspiration in the opening of his book “La Lanterne Magique” in 1883. He became a cult author for the Symbolists, especially for Stéphane Mallarmé who discovered him at the age of twenty and referenced his work throughout his entire life. However, it is only in the 20th century that his work was really recognized. Max Jacob brought attention to Bertrand by making him the inventor of prose poetry.Fernand Rude, Aloysius Bertrand, P. Seghers, 1971, Afterwards, the Surrealists contributed to his fame, especially André Breton who referenced him in his 1924 “Surrealist Manifesto”. René Magritte named one of his paintings “Gaspard de la nuit”, as it was inspired by the poem “Le Maçon”. Maurice Ravel wrote three piano solos on themes from “Gaspard de la nuit”. Since 1922, there is an Aloysius Bertrand street in Dijon. References * , 2 volumes.

It is also known as grey staining, micro spalling or frosting. Pitting and micropitting The difference between pitting corrosion and micropitting is the size of the pits after surface fatigue. Pits formed by micropitting are approximately 10-20 μm in depth, and micropitted metal often has a frosted or gray appearance. Normal pitting creates larger and more visible pits. Micropits are originated from the local contact of asperities produced by improper lubrication. Causes In a normal bearing the surfaces are separated by a layer of oil, this is known as elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication. If the thickness of the EHD film is of the same order of magnitude as the surface roughness, the surface topography is able to interact and cause micro pitting. A thin EHD film may be caused by excess load or temperature, a lower oil viscosity than is required, low speed or water in the oil. Water in the oil can make micro pitting worse by causing hydrogen embrittlement of the surface. Micro pitting occurs only under poor EHD lubrication conditions. A surface with a deep scratch might break exactly at the scratch if stress is applied. One can imagine that the surface roughness is a composite of many very small scratches. So high surface roughness decreases the stability on heavy stressed parts. To get a good overview of the surface an areal scan (Surface metrology) gives more information that a measurement along a single profile (profileometer). To quantify the surface roughness the ISO 25178 can be used.

The park was built as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps and opened in 1939. The park is well known for its crystal clear springs that are estimated to flow per day. The park also offers unique wildlife near the springs, including alligators, turtles, and a variety of birds and fish. During the American Civil War, the area that now comprises the day-use area of the park was used as a prison, Camp Lawton, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The park still houses remnants of the earthen fort that guarded the 10,000-prisoner camp. Two huge timbers, possibly from the prison but more likely from work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1938 and 1942, were recovered from the spring run. The park has 26 tent/RV campsite, eight fully furnished cottages with central HVAC and satellite TV a, a 16-person Group Lodge with satellite TV and screened back porch, and a new History Center that currently displays some of the first artifacts excavated by the archaeology team from Georgia Southern University. Georgia Southern's Sociology/Anthropology Department has been conducting surveys and excavations for a number of years at the park, serving as a partner in revealing and interpreting the history of Camp Lawton. In the summer of 2015, the park is opening a splash pad to ultimately take the place of the aging and underused swimming pool. The nearby Bo Ginn Aquarium and Fish Hatchery has been closed since 2010 after a short period of operation by the Jenkins County Development Authority, but it had also been closed twice before by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (1997) and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (2007).  History  Camp Lawton was established during the Civil War in the fall of 1864 by the Confederate Army to house Union prisoners of war. The Magnolia Springs site was selected to take advantage of the abundant water supply. Built by slave labor and a group of Union prisoners of pine timber harvested on site, the walls measured 12 to high. The stockade began receiving the first of at least 10,299 prisoners in early October. The post was abandoned by the end of November when threatened by Sherman's drive on Savannah. Research using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) conducted in December 2009 by the Lamar Institute of Technology revealed a possible location for the southwest corner of the prison stockade. In 2010 Georgia Southern University undertook archaeological investigations to \\"ground truth\\" the results of the GPR survey.The Society for Georgia Archaeology, \\"Georgia Southern University begins archaeological investigations at Magnolia Springs State Park\\", March 22, 2010.

It lives in Madagascar and can be found in a variety of habitats from rainforest to western Madagascar dry deciduous forests and dry and spiny forests. Its fur is thick and silky and generally white with brown on the sides, top of the head, and on the arms. Like all sifakas, it has a long tail that it uses as a balance when leaping from tree to tree. However, its body is so highly adapted to an arboreal existence, on the ground its only means of locomotion is hopping. The species lives in small troops which forage for food. Anatomy In adulthood, the full head and body length is between . The tail of a fully grown Verreaux's sifaka grows to be between long. In weight, adult females reach on average, and adult males . Verreaux's sifaka has a relatively low, flat braincase. The face is broader than that of most other indriids, but its snout is reduced. This species of sifaka is also distinguished by its unique dentition. Its dental formula is . The upper incisors are very small and are slightly angled inward towards the gap between I1 and I2. In the mandible, Verreaux's sifaka displays the strepsirhine characteristic: the toothcomb. Formed by the procumbent lower incisor and canine, the toothcomb projects past the front margin of the mouth. P. verreauxi also presents the high, shearing molar crests of a folivore, helping to shread the leaves, fruit and flowers that it eats. Postcranially, Verreaux's sifaka has a low intermembral index that ranges from 63-66. It has a broader ribcage than most other prosimians, and has many lumbar vertebrae lending it considerable flexibility. The pelvis is high and narrow and the acetabulum is relatively shallow, also allowing for greater flexibility. Like other indriids, P. verreauxi has a short calcaneus, pointed nails, and slightly webbed hands and feet. Diet folivorous Juvenile Verreaux's sifakas forage for food with their troop, primarily in the morning and late afternoon, so they can rest during the hottest part of the day. They are herbivores; leaves, fruit, bark and flowers are typical components of the diet. However, they are mostly folivorous (leaves represent the majority of the diet over the year, especially in the dry season) and they seem to choose food items based on quality (lower tannin content) rather than on availability. Behaviour Verreaux's sifakas hop along the ground in a forward and sideways movement. Verreaux's sifakas are diurnal and arboreal, and engage in sunbathing with outstretched arms and legs. They move through the trees by clinging and leaping between vertical supports. They are capable of making remarkable leaps through the trees - distances of 9–10 m are not uncommon. On the ground, they hop bipedally.Wunderlich R.E., Lawler R.R., Williams A.E. 2011. Field and experimental approaches to locomotor ontogeny in Propithecus verreauxi In Primate Locomotion: Linking Field and Laboratory Research. K.D. D'Aout, E.E. Vereecke (eds.) Springer Science. pp.135–154 They live in family groups, or troops, of 2-12, which may consist of one male and female, or many males and females together. Group and population sex ratio can be more or less skewed toward males. Many groups seem to be effectively harem groups with a single dominant male unrelated with resident female(s). They have a home range of 2.8 to 5.0 ha, and although they are territorial, they defend food sources rather than territorial boundaries, as often boundaries overlap. Females are dominant over males, forming a matriarchal society. Females use anogenital secretion mainly for territory demarcation whereas males seem to use specialized secretions (via anogenital and throat glands) more for sexual \\"advertisement\\" than for territorial purposes. Males show bimorphism, by showing either a clean or stained chest, derived from throat gland secretions and smeared on surfaces by rubbing the upper part of the chest. Stain-chested males engage in the most active marking, and chest staining seems to be related to testosterone levels. Males and females were found to engage in a biological market, exchanging grooming for grooming during the non-mating period, and grooming (\\"offered\\" by males) for reproductive opportunities (sexual access \\"offered\\" by females) during the mating period. A study found that females copulate more with stained-chested than with clean-chested males. On the other hand, clean-chested males, with a lower scent-releasing potential, usually offer more grooming to females. This “grooming for sex” tactic allows males with a clean chest to get to copulate with females, even if at low rate. It has also been discovered that sifaka dyads often engage in post-conflict reunions after aggressive episodes: reconciliation occurs more frequently when food is not involved and for low intensity aggressions. In this species play behavior persists into adulthood where it is used, especially by stranger males during the mating period, as an ice-breaking mechanism to reduce xenophobia. Reproduction Around 45% of females breed each year when in oestrous between late January and early February. Females give birth to one infant after a gestation period of 130 days, between June and August. For the first 6–8 weeks, the infant clings to the mother's stomach, but for the following 19 weeks, it clings to her back. About 30% of infants are lost to predation by the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and a smaller number to raptors like the Madagascar Harrier-Hawk (Polyboroides radiatus). Those that do survive reach sexual maturity between 3-5 years. Males generally leave the group to join a neighboring group while adult females tend to stay with their natal group. Ecology and conservation status The species is listed in CITES Appendix I, and its IUCN conservation status was updated to Critically Endangered in 2020. In the small spiny forest fragments of South Madagascar, sifaka abundance appears to be influenced by the proportion of large trees (diameter at breast height >=5 cm) and by the abundance of the plant species Allouadia procera, a key species of the spiny forest habitat. A long-term, large-scale demographic study of the species at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar found that the sifaka population there had a population growth rate of 0.98 (with confidence intervals spanning 1), suggesting that the population was not in danger of imminent extinction. However, both severe droughts and an increased annual variation in rainfall levels can depress the population growth rate.

Military career During the Second World War, he served with the 1st Battalion Royal Natal Carabineers 1st SA Infantry Division, South African Forces in the East Africa Campaign against the Italians before moving to the Western Desert. =Victoria Cross= He was 25 years old, and a sergeant when the South African Forces were attacked near Alem Hamza in Libya. During the attack Smythe realised that there was no officer to command his platoon and took charge himself. Although he had a wound in his forehead, causing much loss of blood, he managed single-handedly to obliterate a machine gun post, taking all the surviving crew prisoner. Then, again single-handedly and armed only with rifle and bayonet, he promptly did the same with an enemy anti-tank gun crew, after which he consolidated the position.

Hawks co-owner Michael Gearon Jr. called for him to resign or be dismissed. On September 9, Hawks CEO Steve Koonin announced that the team had decided not to dismiss Ferry and that they were instead going to discipline him. A few days later, Ferry asked to take—and was approved for—an immediate, indefinite leave of absence. In June 2015, an independent investigation reported that Ferry's actions were not motivated by racism. According to UPI, \\"[the] investigation, which included 19 witness interviews and reviewed the contents of more than 24,000 emails, made clear that the offensive language was not Ferry's and none of Ferry's remarks or behavior during the call were motivated by racial or ethnic animus, or by a person's country of origin. To the contrary, the investigation found Ferry shared his own opinion of Deng, recommended him both personally and professionally and ultimately tried to sign him to the team.\\" Following the release of the investigation results, Ferry reached a buyout agreement with the Hawks.http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13129713/danny-ferry-steps- general-manager-atlanta- hawkshttps://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/hawks/2015/06/20/danny-ferry- hawks-luol-deng-comments/29046769/ Ferry became a special advisor to the general manager of the New Orleans Pelicans in June 2016.https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/danny-ferry-new-orleans-pelicans- adviser-atlanta-hawks-060916 After the firing of general manager of Dell Demps on February 15, 2019, Ferry was named the team's interim general manager.

Biography  Spalding was born in Islington in London in 1841, the only son of Jessey Fraser and Alexander Mitchell Spalding, office clerk. Not long after his birth his parents moved to Aberdeenshire, Scotland where they had previously lived. While working as a slater in Aberdeen, the philosopher Alexander Bain persuaded the University of Aberdeen to allow him to attend courses without charge. He studied philosophy and literature, and after a year left for London. He trained as a lawyer. But when he contracted tuberculosis, he travelled in Europe in hopes of finding a cure, and in Avignon met John Stuart Mill and through him Viscount Amberley (son of the former British prime minister Lord John Russell, by then 1st Earl Russell). He became tutor to Viscount Amberley's children, including perhaps the young Bertrand Russell, and also carried on an intermittent affair with Viscountess Amberley. After the Lord Amberley's death in 1876, Spalding returned to the continent and remained there until his death the following year. Spalding carried out some experiments on animal behaviour, and discovered the phenomenon now known as imprinting, later rediscovered by Oskar Heinroth, then studied at length and popularised by Konrad Lorenz. He was greatly ahead of his time in his recognition of the importance of the interaction between learning and instinct in determining behaviour, and in his use of the experimental method in studying behaviour. Although his work is little known nowadays, its importance is recognised by historians of psychology; the biologist J. B. S. Haldane reprinted Spalding's essay \\"On Instinct\\" in 1954 to clarify the history of the subject. He was first to identify, in 1873, the process which is now known as the Baldwin effectNoble, R and Noble D (2017) Was the Watchmaker Blind? Or Was She One-Eyed?

She was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1999 to 2014, representing Monash Province until the 2006 election and the Southern Metropolitan Region thereafter. Coote was born in Melbourne, and studied at Fintona Girls' School and the University of Melbourne. Before being elected to parliament, she worked in a number of business and executive positions, which included stints as Executive Director of the State Library Foundation (1994–1996) and Director of Development at Geelong Grammar School (1996–1998). In the early 1990s, she also worked as a staff officer to Member of the Legislative Assembly Michael John, and later as a ministerial adviser. Coote succeeded in winning Liberal pre-selection for the safe Liberal-held seat of Monash Province in the leadup to the 1999 election, and was ultimately elected. Jeff Kennett's Liberal government, however, had suffered a surprise defeat, so Coote found herself in opposition. Despite this, due to the way the Legislative Council is elected, the Liberal Party still had control of the upper house, giving them significant power to reject legislation introduced by the new Labor government. In her first term in office, Coote was a member of the Legislative Council Printing Committee, and in 2000, also gained a seat on the Economic Development Committee. During her first term, Coote also became notable for her support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. Coote became one of a small group of Liberal Legislative Councillors - along with Andrew Olexander (since expelled from the parliamentary Liberal Party following a drink-driving incident), and before they lost their seats at the 2002 election, Peter Katsambanis and Leonie Burke - that lobbied for gay-friendly changes in party policy. Along with these three, Coote regularly met with representatives from the LGBT communities in Melbourne. The Victorian Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby specifically singled out Coote for praise, describing her as \\"very proactive on gay issues\\". The influence of Coote and her allies was most clearly illustrated when the Liberal Party backed down on its prior opposition to the 2001 Statute Law Further Amendment (Relationships) Bill, which Coote spoke in support of. The passage of the bill resulted in major changes, requiring that lesbian and gay relationships be treated equally in fields such as property, superannuation, and medication decision-making. The 2002 election was devastating for the Liberal Party, resulting in the loss of their control of the Legislative Council, and with Katsambanis and Burke being among those losing their seats. However, this opened up a number of new shadow ministerial positions, and Coote was one of those promoted. She became Shadow Minister for Tourism, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Manager of the Opposition Business in the Council and Shadow Minister for Ageing and Carers. She also received the additional portfolio of Victorian Communities in January 2004. Coote was re-elected in 2006 to the Southern Metropolitan Region. In 2006, she was appointed Shadow Minister for the Portfolios of Community Services, Children and Aboriginal Affairs. She is also Manager of Opposition Business in the Legislative Council, and is a member of the Legislation Committee of the Legislative Council. In 2007 she was reelected as Deputy Leader of the Legislative Council for the Opposition. But after continuous disagreements with Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu both Phillip Davis and Andrea Coote resigned from their Leadership and Shadow Cabinet positions in favour of returning to the backbench of the Legislative Council. After the election of the Baillieu Liberal Government in 2010, Coote was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Families and Community Services, assisting Mary Wooldrige in the first Baillieu Ministry. Coote did not nominated for the election held on 29 November 2014 choosing to retire from parliament.

The hall \\"is renowned for its acoustical excellence and graceful architecture.\\" Kleinhans is currently the home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, a regular venue for the Buffalo Chamber Music Society, and is rented out for other performing groups and local events. The building was designed by father-and-son team Eliel Saarinen and Eero Saarinen, with help from local architects F. J. and W. A. Kidd, Stanley McCandless as lighting consultant, and Charles C. Potwin as acoustical adviser. Kleinhans has two performance spaces, as well as additional rooms for rehearsals or private events. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its architecture, and 49 years after its completion.  Performance Spaces  Kleinhans Music Hall offers two spaces for performances: the main auditorium, and the Mary Seaton Room. The main auditorium of Kleinhans Music Hall offers seats 2,441 (it originally accommodated 2839 seats, but underwent renovations in 2015), and showcases the hall's parabolic ceiling and acoustically-informed design. The shape of the hall is such that audience members in the back rows of the balcony will have as clear and instantaneous of an auditory experience as the people in the front rows of the ground level. Charles C. Potwin employed a 1:1.3 ratio in the design of the auditorium to achieve the most ideal acoustic. While the design of the main auditorium is less conducive to reverberation, it aims to create a more intimate experience by drawing the audience in. The austere color palette and simple lines seen in the layout also serve to direct the audience to the music without distraction of ornate decoration. The Mary Seaton Room is the smaller of the two performance venues, seating up to 700 for a concert, and is well suited for chamber ensembles. History Kleinhans Music Hall was named by Edward L. Kleinhans in honor of his wife, Mary Seaton Kleinhans, and his mother, Mary Livingston Kleinhans. The Kleinhans family owned a successful men's clothing company in Buffalo at the turn of the 20th century. Upon their deaths, three months apart in 1934, they left their entire estate of around $1 million to the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo with the request that the funds go to the development of a music hall. Upon its completion in 1940, the cost of construction reached $1.5 million, and included funds from President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration in addition to the $1 million from the Kleinhans estate. Kleinhans Music Hall opened on October 19, 1940 with an inaugural concert by the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra under Maestro Franco Autori. In 2015, the seats of the auditorium were updated, and storage rooms were converted into an archive room to serve as an educational feature of the building's philanthropic history and architectural significance. =Notable events= On September 8, 1964, Robert F. Kennedy, who at the time was the Democratic candidate to become a United States Senator from New York, gave a speech at Kleinhans in front of a crowd of 6,000 people. On November 9, 1967, four months after the city was rocked by the Buffalo riot, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech at Kleinhans titled \\"The Future of Integration.\\" In this speech, he proclaimed, \\"We are moving toward the day when we will judge a man by his character and ability instead of by the color of his skin.\\" References External links * Kleinhans Music Hall - Venue Website *Information from the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra * Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at Buffalo Music venues completed in 1940 Buildings and structures in Buffalo, New York Concert halls in New York (state) Music of Buffalo, New York Economy of Buffalo, New York Eero Saarinen structures National Historic Landmarks in New York (state) Tourist attractions in Buffalo, New York Modernist architecture in New York (state) National Register of Historic Places in Buffalo, New York Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) 1940 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Kleinhans Music Hall"},{"id":"1206709","title":"List of The Simpsons home video releases"},{"id":"1206717","text":"The R-73 (NATO reporting name AA-11 Archer) is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by Vympel NPO that entered service in 1984. Development The R-73 was developed to replace the earlier R-60 (AA-8 'Aphid') weapon for short-range use by Soviet fighter aircraft. Work began in 1973, and the first missiles entered service in 1984. The R-73 is an infrared homing (heat- seeking) missile with a sensitive, cryogenic cooled seeker with a substantial \\"off-boresight\\" capability: the seeker can \\"see\\" targets up to 40° off the missile's centerline. It can be targeted by a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) allowing pilots to designate targets by looking at them. Minimum engagement range is about 300 meters, with maximum aerodynamic range of nearly at altitude. The weapon is used by the MiG-29, MiG-31, Su-27/33, Su-34 and Su-35, and can be carried by newer versions of the MiG-21, MiG-23, Sukhoi Su-24, and Su-25 aircraft.http://www.uuaz.ru/production/su25ub/su25ub_wpn_e.html India is looking to use the missile on their HAL Tejas. It can also be carried by Russian attack helicopters, including the Mil Mi-24, Mil Mi-28, and Kamov Ka-50/52. From 1994, the R-73 has been upgraded in production to the R-73M standard, which entered CIS service in 1997. The R-73M has greater range and a wider seeker angle (to 60° off-boresight), as well as improved IRCCM (Infrared Counter-Counter-Measures).

The survey determined the large-scale structure in two large slices of the Universe to a depth of around 2.5 billion light years (redshift ~ 0.2). It was the world's largest redshift survey between 1998 (overtaking Las Campanas Redshift Survey) and 2003 (overtaken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Matthew Colless, Richard Ellis, Steve Maddox and John Peacock were in charge of the project. Team members Shaun Cole and John Peacock were awarded a share of the 2014 Shaw Prize in astronomy for results from the 2dFGRS.  Description  The 2dF survey covered an area of about 1500 square degrees, surveying regions in both the north and the south galactic poles.2dFGRS − An Introduction The name derives from the fact that the survey instrument has a 2 degree diameter field of view. The areas selected for observation were previously surveyed by the massive APM Galaxy Survey (on which Steve Maddox also worked). The regions surveyed cover roughly 75 degrees of right ascension for both bands, and the declination of the North Polar band was about 7.5 degrees while the declination of the South Polar band was about 15 degrees. Hundreds of isolated two degree fields near the South Polar band were also surveyed (see this illustration, where black circles represent survey fields, and the red grid represents the earlier APM survey). In total, the photometry of 382,323 objects were measured, which includes spectra for 245,591 objects, of which 232,155 were galaxies (221,414 with good quality spectra), 12,311 are stars, and 125 are quasi-stellar objects (quasars).2dFGRS Summary Statistics The survey necessitated 272 required nights of observation, spread over 5 years. The survey was carried out with the 4 metre Anglo-Australian Telescope, with the 2dF instrument installed at the primary focus permitting the observation of a field of 2 degrees per pointing. The instrument possesses a spectrograph equipped with two banks each of 200 optical fibres, permitting the simultaneous measurement of 400 spectra. The limiting apparent magnitude of the survey is 19.5, covering objects with a redshift mostly within less than z=0.3 and a median redshift of 0.11. The volume of the Universe covered by the survey is approximately 108 h−1 Mpc3, where h corresponds to the value of the Hubble constant, H0, divided by 100. H0 is approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. The largest redshift observed by the survey corresponds to a distance of 600 h−1 Mpc.  Survey Results  The principal results obtained for the field of cosmology by the 2dF survey are: * The measurement of the density parameter of non-relativistic matter (baryonic matter plus dark matter plus massive neutrinos) * The detection of Baryon acoustic oscillations, and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter * Limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter, putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV. All these results are in agreement with the measurements of other experiments, notably those of WMAP. They confirm the standard cosmological model.

Their language is according to some sources a dialect of Hassaniyya, according to others a mixture of Zenaga, Soninke and Hassaniyya.Christopher Moseley, Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages, Routledge, 2007, p. 623: No data exists on this language.

Accounts of the language According to Robert Arnaud (1906), \\"around Tichit the Nemadi employ a dialect called Azeïr which is close to Soninke.\\" Chudeau (1913), perhaps following him, adds that \\"We have little information on their language, which M. Delafosse classifies provisionally with Soninké.\\" However, Brosset (1932) says that they speak Hassaniyya, and that \\"their special vocabulary does not consist of vocables different from Hassaniyya, but of technical terms which need has forced them to create, which are forged from Arabic, Zenaga, and maybe Azer.\\" Ech Chinguetti's Kitab El Wasit says that \\"The Nmadi speak the dialect common to all the Moors (i.e. Hassaniyya). However, they do not pronounce the final m of the affixed second person plural pronoun, so they say: as-Salam alayku (\\"peace be upon you\\") for alaikum, and kayfa haluku (\\"how are you?\\") for halukum.\\" Laforgue claims that they speak \\"Zenati\\", i.e. Berber, a claim seen by Hermans as \\"very improbable\\". According to Gerteiny (1967), they speak \\"their own dialect, probably a mixture of Azêr [Soninke], Zenaga, and Hassaniyya, called Ikôku by the Moors.

Hermans' opinion is that \\"the language spoken by the Nemadi in general (there may remain some Azer-speaking Nemadi) is Hassaniyya. But one must recognize certain peculiarities\\", including the lack of plural, certain argot-like expressions (cf. Fondacci), and the technical terms (cf. Brosset, Fondacci, Gabus.)

He also is a TV sports analyst and recreational equipment vendor. Crouch played college football for the University of Nebraska. In 2001 Crouch won the Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding collegiate football player in the United States. He also won the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award, given annually to the best collegiate quarterback in the US. During that year running Nebraska's option offense,\\"Catching up with former Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch\\", Daily Nebraskan he completed 105 of 189 passes for 1,510 yards and seven touchdowns, while also rushing for 1,115 yards and 18 touchdowns. Crouch was the USA Today Nebraska Player of the Year, and a Parade All-American athlete at Millard North High School, where he was a two-time All-State selection at quarterback. Crouch appeared on the cover of the video game NCAA College Football 2K3. College football Ankle surgery forced Crouch to redshirt for the 1997 co-national championship-winning season. In 1998, Bobby Newcombe began the season as the starting quarterback, but he was sidelined by a knee injury after the first game and Crouch took over the starting duties. Against UAB, Crouch rushed for two touchdowns and completed 11 of 17 passes in his first career start. 1998 proved to be a chaotic season for the Cornhuskers. Crouch made another start before being replaced by a healthy Bobby Newcombe. Newcombe started the next five games, but was pulled in the middle of a game because of a PCL strain. Senior walk- on, Monte Christo, took over for Newcombe, and started the following week against Texas. With Texas leading 10-0 in the middle of the second quarter, Christo was pulled and replaced by Crouch. Crouch remained the starter for the rest of the season, which ended with a 23-20 loss to Arizona in the Holiday Bowl. The next fall Newcombe was named the starting quarterback, and it was rumored that Crouch might leave the team. Crouch, however, was given significant playing time in the first and second games. He started the third game against Southern Mississippi, and Newcombe moved to wingback. Crouch led Nebraska in a season that saw NU avenge its only loss of the season in a rematch against Texas in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Cornhuskers finished the season with a 12-1 record and ranked No. 3 after defeating Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl. Crouch started every game in the 2000 season, which ended with a 66-17 trouncing of Northwestern in the Alamo Bowl. Nebraska's only losses during the 10-2 season were to eventual national champion, Oklahoma Sooners, and the Kansas State Wildcats. In 2001 Crouch had his best year, breaking school or NCAA records almost weekly and appearing to be a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy. In the first game of the 2001 season, a 21-7 defeat of TCU, Crouch surpassed Tommie Frazier as Nebraska's all-time total offense leader. He became the Big 12 all-time career rushing quarterback in the emotionally charged game against Rice. The next week, against Missouri, Crouch was backed up near the goal line when he scrambled to escape from defenders and pulled off a 95-yard touchdown run, the longest in school history. Against Iowa State the following week, Crouch broke the record for career touchdowns by a quarterback. Crouch became only the fourth player in Division 1 history to both pass and rush for 3,000 yards in a career with his performance against Texas Tech. Next, in a hard-fought game against defending national champion Oklahoma, Crouch again showed off his speed and playmaking abilities, this time serving as quarterback and receiver in a single play, the famous \\"Black 41 Flash Reverse Pass\\" in which Crouch made a 63-yard touchdown reception. By mid-November Crouch had set a school record for most career wins as a starter and became only the ninth quarterback in D-1A history to have won 35 games as a starter. The Cornhuskers were 11-0 going into the annual contest with Colorado the day after Thanksgiving. Crouch had a career day, setting the school record for offense yards in a single game with 360 yards. The Nebraska defense was dominated by the Buffaloes, however, and gave up a then-record 62 points to Colorado. The 62-36 loss appeared to have ended Nebraska's hopes of playing for the national championship and to have hurt Crouch's chances of winning the Heisman. Two weeks later, Crouch was announced as the recipient of the award, edging out Florida's Rex Grossman and Miami's Ken Dorsey in the closest Heisman ballot since 1985. His outstanding season also was recognized when he won the Davey O'Brien Award for being the best collegiate quarterback in the nation during the 2001 season. In the meantime several highly ranked teams were upset and in the final BCS rankings, Nebraska beat out one-loss Oregon and two-loss Colorado to earn the No. 2 spot in the BCS rankings. The final BCS rankings were steeped in controversy since Nebraska had the chance to play in the Rose Bowl for the national championship despite not winning a conference or division championship. In the Rose Bowl on January 3, 2002, Crouch rushed for 114 yards against the Miami Hurricanes but was denied a touchdown for the first time since September, 1999. The No. 1 Hurricanes defeated the Cornhuskers 37-14, leaving Crouch with a 35-7 record as a starting quarterback. =Awards= * 2001 Heisman Trophy * 2001 Davey O'Brien Award * 2001 Walter Camp Award * 2001 Big 12 Conference offensive player of the year * 2000 Third-Team All-American (College Football News) * 2000 Second-Team All-Big 12 (AP, Sporting News, Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle) * 2000 Third-Team All-Big 12 (Coaches) * 2000 Fiesta Bowl Offensive MVP vs. Tennessee * 1999 Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the Year (Coaches) =Records= * One of three quarterbacks in Division I-A history to rush for 3,000 and pass for 4,000 yards in a career * 13th player in NCAA to rush and pass for 1,000 in a season (1,115 rushing, 1,510 passing) * Nebraska career total offense leader with 7,915 yards * Former Nebraska single-season total offense leader with 2,688 yards * Former Nebraska single-game total offense record of 360 yards * Nebraska career total-offense touchdown leader with 88 * Owns Nebraska career record for most rushing yards by a quarterback (3,434) * NCAA record for most career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (59) * Most rushing attempts by a Husker quarterback (648) * Former Nebraska total TD passes in a game (5 vs. Iowa) * Most rushing TDs in a game by a quarterback (4 vs. Kansas) * Set a QB record for most rushing TDs in a season (20) * Set school records in 2001 for most rushing attempts in a season for a quarterback (203) * Most total offense yards by a sophomore (2,158) * Tied an NCAA record by scoring a TD via run, pass, reception in the same game (vs. University of California, Berkeley, 1999) * Nebraska school record longest run from scrimmage, 95 yards (vs. Missouri, 2001) =Statistics= {class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! ! colspan=6Passing ! colspan=4Rushing - !

Crouch, however, was seen by NFL teams as being too short to play quarterback. His athleticism was seen as better suited for playing wideout, but a hard tackle by a defensive player caused him to have 150cc of blood drained from his leg. Because of the injury, Crouch left the team before playing a game. Crouch signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in January 2005, and was allocated to the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe. Crouch converted to the safety position, recording 25 tackles and 2 passes defended. =CFL= Crouch's opportunity to play quarterback at the professional level finally came when he signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on February 15, 2006 as a quarterback. (The Argonauts had owned his CFL rights for several years.) In his inaugural CFL season Crouch eventually became the fourth-string quarterback in Toronto, behind Damon Allen, Michael Bishop, and Spergon Wynn. On July 22, 2006, Crouch made his regular season CFL debut against the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Regina, Saskatchewan. Coming in at the start of the second half following an injury to Wynn, Crouch sealed the win for Toronto with solid play, including a 94-yard pass completion to Arland Bruce III. In 2007 Crouch was expected to battle Michael Bishop, Damon Allen, Mike McMahon and Tom Arth for the Argos' starting quarterback position, but he eventually faltered because of injury. He began the season on the nine-week disabled list. After coming off the disabled list, Crouch was released by the Argonauts on September 6, 2007. =AAFL= On September 25, 2007, Crouch signed with the upstart All-American Football League. He was drafted 3rd overall by Team Texas on January 26, 2008, in the first round of the league's inaugural draft. He was, however, released from his contract (along with all AAFL players) when the league canceled its debut season. =UFL= On April 9, 2011, Crouch attended a public workout for the United Football League's Omaha Nighthawks. On June 8, 2011, Crouch accepted an invitation to attend the Nighthawks mini- camp.http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8203c264/article/ufls-omaha- nighthawks-looking-at-exrams-draft-pick-crouch?module=HP_headlines On June 10, 2011, he was added to the Nighthawks official roster. The UFL suspended operations on October 20, 2012. Post-playing career Eric Crouch was a sales territory manager for a major medical device manufacturer in the US. Currently, Crouch is a vendor of playground and recreation equipment at Crouch Recreation in Omaha, Nebraska.

Biography Somers was born in Belturbet, County Cavan on 12 June 1894. He was 21 years old, and a sergeant in the 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 1/2 July 1915, in Gallipoli, Turkey, when, owing to hostile bombing, some of his troops had retired from a sap, Sergeant Somers remained alone there until a party brought up bombs. He then climbed over into the Turkish trench and bombed the Turks with great effect. Later on, he advanced into the open under heavy fire and held back the enemy by throwing bombs into their flank until a barricade had been established. During this period, he frequently ran to and from his trenches to obtain fresh supplies of bombs. In a letter to his father, Somers wrote: :\\"I beat the Turks out of our trench single-handed and had four awful hours at night. The Turks swarmed in from all roads, but I gave them a rough time of it, still holding the trench. It is certain sure we are beating the Turks all right. In the trench I came out of, it was shocking to see the dead. They lay, about three thousand Turks, in front of our trenches, and the smell was absolutely chronic. You know when the sun has been shining on those bodies for three or four days it makes a horrible smell; a person would not mind if it was possible to bury them. But no, you dare not put your nose outside the trench, and if you did, you would be a dead man.\\" He had previously been severely wounded during the Retreat from Mons in August 1914. Later in the war, Somers served with the Army Service Corps on the Western Front. He died on 7 May 1918 (aged 24), and was buried with full military honours in Modreeny Church of Ireland cemetery. His Union Jack-draped coffin was carried on a gun carriage, led by the Pipe Band of the Cameron Highlanders. His headstone states simply:He stood and defended. The Lord wrought a great wonder.

It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins. It was patented in 1961 and approved for medical use in 1963.. It is marketed under more than twelve different trade names.Trade names are listed on DrugBank.ca entry DB00328 As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than 25 USD. In 2017, it was the 291st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses As an NSAID, indometacin is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Clinical indications for indometacin include: Joint diseases *rheumatoid arthritis *ankylosing spondylitis *osteoarthritis *gouty arthritis *acute painful shoulder bursitis or tendinitis Headaches *Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias *Paroxysmal hemicranias *Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania *Episodic paroxysmal hemicrania *Hemicrania continua *Valsalva- induced headaches *Primary cough headache *Primary exertional headache *Primary headache associated with sexual activity (preorgasmic and orgasmic) *Primary stabbing headache (jabs and jolts syndrome) *Hypnic headache Others *Patent ductus arteriosus Contraindications * Concurrent peptic ulcer, or history of ulcer disease * Allergy to indometacin, aspirin, or other NSAIDs * Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastric sleeve patients * Patients with nasal polyps reacting with an angioedema to other NSAIDs * Children under 2 years of age (with the exception of neonates with patent ductus arteriosus) * Severe pre-existing renal and liver damage * Caution: pre-existing bone marrow damage (frequent blood cell counts are indicated) * Caution: bleeding tendencies of unknown origin (indometacin inhibits platelet aggregation) * Caution: Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, psychotic disorders (indometacin may worsen these conditions) * Concurrent with potassium sparing diuretics * Patients who have a patent ductus arteriosus dependent heart defect (such as transposition of the great vessels) * Significant hypertension (high blood pressure) * Concomitant administration of lithium salts (such as lithium carbonate) Adverse effects In general, adverse effects seen with indometacin are similar to all other NSAIDs. For instance, indometacin inhibits both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which then inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the stomach and intestines responsible for maintaining the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Indometacin, therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors, can cause peptic ulcers. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding or perforation, requiring hospitalization of the patient. To reduce the possibility of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50 and 200 mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin. Many NSAIDs, but particularly indometacin, cause lithium retention by reducing its excretion by the kidneys. Thus indometacin users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. for treatment of depression or bipolar disorder), less toxic NSAIDs such as sulindac or aspirin are preferred. All NSAIDs, including indometacin, also increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, and increase sodium and potassium retention. Vasopressin activity is also enhanced. Together these may lead to: * Edema (swelling due to fluid retention) * Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) * Hypernatremia (high sodium levels) * Hypertension Elevations of serum creatinine and more serious renal damage such as acute kidney failure, chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and high potassium levels in the blood. Paradoxically yet uncommonly, indometacin can cause headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia as well as acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects. The frequency and severity of side effects and the availability of better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute gout attacks and in dysmenorrhea is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur. People should undergo regular physical examination to detect edema and signs of central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes as well as of creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an ACE inhibitor or with potassium-sparing diuretics, because these combinations can lead to hyperkalemia and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied. Rare cases have shown that use of this medication by pregnant women can have an effect on the fetal heart, possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the Ductus arteriosus. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. Mechanism of action Indometacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has similar mode of action when compared to other drugs in this group. Its is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, the enzymes that participate in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules normally found in the body, where they have a wide variety of effects, some of which lead to pain, fever, and inflammation. By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin can reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Indometacin mechanism of action, along with several other NSAIDs that inhibit COX, was described in 1971. Besides, indometacin has logarithmic acid dissociation constant pKa of 3 to 4.5. Since the physiologic body pH is well above the pKa range of indometacin, most of the indometacin molecules will be dissociated into ionized form, leaving very little un-ionized form of indometacin to cross a cell membrane. If the pH gradient across a cell membrane is high, most of the indometacin molecules will be trapped in one side of the membrane with higher pH. This phenomenon is called \\"ion trapping\\". The phenomenon of ion trapping is particularly prominent in the stomach as pH at the stomach mucosa layer is extremely acidic, while the parietal cells are more alkaline. Therefore, indometacin are trapped inside the parietal cells in ionized form, damaging the stomach cells, causing stomach irritation. This stomach irritation can reduce if the stomach acid pH is reduced. Indometacin's role in treating certain headaches is unique compared to other NSAIDs. In addition to the class effect of COX inhibition, there is evidence that indometacin has the ability to reduce cerebral blood flow not only through modulation of nitric oxide pathways but also via intracranial precapillary vasoconstriction. Indometacin property of reducing cerebral blood flow is useful in treating raised intracranial pressure. A case report has shown that an intravenous bolus dose of indometacin given with 2 hours of continuous infusion is able to reduce intracranial pressure by 37% in 10 to 15 minutes and increases cerebral perfusion pressure by 30% at the same time. This reduction in cerebral pressure may be responsible for the remarkable efficacy in a group of headaches that is referred to as \\"indometacin-responsive headaches\\", such as idiopathic stabbing headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicranial, and exertional headaches. On the other hand, the activation of superior salivary nucleus in the brainstem is used to stimulate the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc, causing a type of headache called trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Indometacin inhibits the superior salivatory nucleus, thus relieving this type of headache. Prostaglandins also cause uterine contractions in pregnant women. Indometacin is an effective tocolytic agent, able to delay premature labor by reducing uterine contractions through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus and possibly through calcium channel blockade. Indometacin readily crosses the placenta and can reduce fetal urine production to treat polyhydramnios. It does so by reducing renal blood flow and increasing renal vascular resistance, possibly by enhancing the effects of vasopressin on the fetal kidneys.

On January 1, 1963, it merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  History  American Institute of Electrical Engineers bookplate (original copy at Harvard University Trust). The 1884 founders of the Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) included some of the most prominent inventors and innovators in the then new field of electrical engineering, among them Thomas Alva Edison, Nikola Tesla, Elihu Thomson, Edwin J. Houston, and Edward Weston. The purpose of the AIEE was stated \\"to promote the Arts and Sciences connected with the production and utilization of electricity and the welfare of those employed in these Industries: by means of social intercourse, the reading and discussion of professional papers and the circulation by means of publication among members and associates of information thus obtained.\\" The first president of AIEE was Norvin Green, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Other notable AIEE presidents were Alexander Graham Bell (1891–1892), Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1901–1902), Bion J. Arnold (1903-1904), Schuyler S. Wheeler (1905–1906), Dugald C. Jackson (1910–1911), Ralph D. Mershon (1912–1913), Michael I. Pupin (1925–1926), and Titus G. LeClair (1950–1951). The first technical meeting of the AIEE was held during the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (October 7–8, at the Franklin Institute). After several years of operating primarily in New York City, the AIEE authorized local sections in 1902. These were formed first in the United States (Chicago and Ithaca, 1902) and then in other countries (the first section outside the US being Toronto, Ontario, Canada, established in 1903). The AIEE's regional structure was soon complemented by a technical structure –the first technical committee of AIEE (the High Voltage Transmission Committee) being formed in 1903. Standardization work started in 1891 with the formation of a committee on units and standards, followed by a committee on standard wiring. The formation of the AIEE Subcommittee on Large- Scale Computing in 1946 was considered a key milestone in the history of computer engineering. It was the first time that a professional association recognized the significance of computers and computing in electro-technology. The early technical areas of interest of AIEE were electric power, lighting, and wired communications. Radio and wireless communications became the major focus of a rival organization, the Institute of Radio Engineers (the IRE, established 1912). The dynamic growth of radio technology and the emergence of the new discipline of electronics in the 1940s led to stiff competition between AIEE and IRE, with IRE showing faster growth in the 1950s and early 1960s, and attracting more students. In 1957, the IRE, with approximately 55,500 members, surpassed the AIEE in membership size; by 1962 the IRE had 96,500 members to the AIEE's 59,000.  Institute's first logo  After the AIEE's founding in 1884, its member's badge was created in 1893 by a committee headed by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, President of AIEE from 1891 to 1892. The badge's logo depicted Benjamin Franklin's kite, representative of the discovery that lightning carried electricity. The design also showed a winding of gold wire with its midpoints crossed by a galvanometer's indicator, invoking the electrical engineer's Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, Ohm's law and the letters 'AIEE' were added in gold at the logo's base. The busy logo design was replaced four years later.Evolution of the IEEE Logo, IEEE Student Journal, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, March 1963, Page 48  Merger and evolution  The AIEE and the IRE merged in 1963 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), in short order becoming the world's largest technical society.

Its primary performing venue is Kleinhans Music Hall, which is a National Historic Landmark. Its regular concert season features gala concerts, classics programming of core repertoire, pops concerts, educational youth concerts and family concerts. During the summer months, the orchestra performs at many parks and outdoor venues across Western New York. Cameron Baird, Frederick Slee, and Samuel P. Capen founded the orchestra in 1934. (Baird's and Slee's names now grace the two buildings which house the music department at the University at Buffalo, while the university's main administration building is named after Capen.) The BPO first performed during the 1935–1936 season under music director Lajos Shuk, and moved to Kleinhans upon the concert hall's completion, performing at its dedicatory gala on October 12, 1940. Past music directors of the Philharmonic have included William Steinberg, Josef Krips, Willis Page, Lukas Foss, Michael Tilson Thomas, Semyon Bychkov, and Maximiano Valdés. During Foss's tenure, the BPO was considered the world leader in performance of 20th century symphonic music. The current music director is JoAnn Falletta, the orchestra's first female music director. Stefan Sanders is the current resident conductor. John Morris Russell is the Principal Pops Conductor. Other celebrated conductors who have led the orchestra include Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sir Neville Marriner, and Henry Mancini. Doc Severinsen was the resident pops conductor in the 1990s. Another notable BPO pops conductor was Marvin Hamlisch who is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning musical, A Chorus Line. Actor Sorrell Booke also conducted the orchestra on at least one occasion. The orchestra has recorded extensively. Under Steinberg, the BPO released a critically acclaimed first commercial recording: Dmitri Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony. Under Falletta's directorship, the BPO's recording program has focused on American composers for the Naxos label, including Frederick Converse, Charles Tomlinson Griffes, and contemporary compositions, including the first commercial recording of John Corigliano's Mr Tambourine Man which received two GRAMMY AwardsGrammy award winners search in 2009. She also founded a house label, Beau Fleuve, on which the orchestra has released discs including \\"Built For Buffalo,\\" featuring commissioned works, and \\"Carnivals and Fairy Tales,\\" a children's album narrated by Falletta and Robby Takac of the Goo Goo Dolls. The orchestra can also be heard in the soundtrack to Woody Allen's Manhattan. History =Creation and early years= During the late 1920s and early 30s, considerable efforts were made to foster interest in a professional orchestra for the Greater Buffalo community. By late 1934, via the efforts of Cameron Baird, Frederick Slee and Samuel Capen, a conductor of extensive European training was recruited to Buffalo in the person of Lajos Shuk, a cello virtuoso and director of the New York Civic Symphony. Shortly thereafter, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra Society was formed and a series of classics concerts and the first BPO youth concerts were presented in the 1935-36 season. Through the leadership of Society President Mrs. Edgar F. Wendt, funds were raised to maintain a viable ensemble through 1937 when support was received from the federal WPA project, which sponsored additional players and recruited a conductor named Franco Autori from the Dallas Symphony. Over the next two seasons (despite a variety of administrative and financial growing pains) the Orchestra presented many fine symphonic performances with renowned soloists, and began performing run- out concerts to neighboring localities like Niagara Falls. Finally, by the opening of the 1939-40 season, the Society and the Greater Buffalo community were ready to provide enduring support for the expansion of both the classical and lighter 'Pops' programming by its burgeoning orchestra. The only thing missing from the equation was a fine concert hall. =Kleinhans Music Hall= Kleinhans Music Hall, the main base of the orchestra Opened in the fall of 1940, Kleinhans Music Hall is a shrine for music which enjoys an international reputation equal to that of its resident orchestra, with exquisite acoustics and a large seating capacity of 2,400. Constructed with funds in part bequeathed by Edward L. Kleinhans and Mary Seaton Kleinhans, the Hall has ever since served as the Orchestra's permanent home. Kleinhans Music Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. The hall was designed by Eliel and Eero Saarinen. While many capital improvements have been made over the years, the look and feel of the hall has changed little since 1940. The BPO dedication concert of Kleinhans in October 1940 signaled that the time was right for the Orchestra to grow internally with additional players; externally with expanded outreach and the regular appearance of major concertizing artists; a series of FM broadcasts; and a more widely diverse repertoire. With demands on his expanding career, Autori resigned in the spring of 1945 and closed his tenure by conducting the Buffalo premiere of Copland's Lincoln Portrait with Carl Sandburg as narrator. =William Steinberg era= Time was prime for a new maestro in the revered opera-symphonic tradition. A major coup was achieved when the industrious and ever-versatile Cameron Baird (the Chairman of the UB Music Department) received a recommendation from Arturo Toscanini of the NBC Symphony that its Associate Conductor, William Steinberg, would be perfect for the job. The Steinberg era of the BPO was marked by many changes in orchestra personnel, including the beginning of an influx of extraordinary European musicians who had (like maestro Steinberg himself) sought new lives and careers here in the United States just after the War. Their presence on stage - primarily in the strings - served to define the distinctly European sound that began to resonate from the BPO during the late 40s and continued throughout the 50s and well beyond. To this of course was added Steinberg's relentless demand for impeccable and dynamic performances. The time frame and timbre are nicely preserved on the BPO's first commercial recording, the Leningrad Symphony No.7 by Shostakovich on the Musicraft label. Moreover, several of the Orchestra's performances were recorded for broadcast on the NBC radio network, beginning in 1947, and currently preserved in the BPO Archive and at the Library of Congress. =Krips, Foss, and Artpark= By the time Steinberg resigned in 1952 to take over the Pittsburgh Symphony, the BPO was a mature and polished ensemble. Indeed, it was the remarkable talent here at Kleinhans that enabled the Orchestra's Board of Directors to achieve an artistic coup in 1953 by stealing the new BPO music director right from the podium of the London Symphony. It was none other than Josef Krips, the fine Viennese master who before the War had also been the Music Director of the Vienna State Opera. The Krips era witnessed a major expansion in the length of the season and the number of musicians employed as well as the re-initiation of major tours in the eastern United States and Canada, including the Maritime Provinces. Although it made no recordings at this time, the dark, European timbre of the orchestra matured in bottle like a fine vintage wine. The sound was mellow and sophisticated, with a nuance of tempo and robust phrasing that marked the great orchestras of the 'old world' European tradition. But 'tradition' was in for a big surprise after Krips resigned in 1961 to take over the San Francisco Symphony. Indeed, creative lightning was set to strike at the downbeat of the 1963-64 season when American composer, conductor and piano virtuoso Lukas Foss took the helm as the new music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic. At the opening concert the walls of Kleinhans were at once enchanted by Ives' Unanswered Question, then thrilled for the first time with the flash and peal of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Little did anyone realize that even 'Le Sacre' would be 'old hat' in a hurry. Within three seasons the BPO led the orchestra world in the performance of new music. The Orchestra was invited to Carnegie Hall for the first of what became regular appearances there. Its first truly major recordings were made on the Nonesuch label featuring the music of Sibelius, Cage, Penderecki, Xenakis, Ruggles and Foss. Moreover, the BPO's first nationwide TV appearances were broadcast on PBS with Stockhousen's Momente and Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, after which followed the initiation of several major tours, including two national tours with Arthur Fiedler and his 'Pops' repertoire. Buffalo and the BPO even received feature coverage in Life Magazine. Then, in a misty rain in 1970 maestro Foss shared the dias with Governor Nelson Rockefeller at the ground breaking at Artpark, the declared permanent summer home of the BPO. =1971 - Present= When Foss resigned to take on the Jerusalem Symphony in 1971, he was followed by the 24-year-old, American-born wunderkind Michael Tilson Thomas. Over the next several seasons with MTT the Orchestra made two Columbia recordings and toured regularly, with frequent appearances in Carnegie Hall (including a gala special there with jazz great Sarah Vaughan) and performances in Boston's Symphony Hall and Washington's Kennedy Center. With the BPO Thomas also made two celebrated recordings for Columbia records (now Sony) including a brilliant set of Gershwin show overtures - a recording which found a second life on the sound track of the Woody Allen film Manhattan. In July 1974, MTT also presided over the BPO dedication concert at Artpark as the Orchestra's intended summer home. With many demands on his time, in 1978 Thomas resigned after accepting an appointment with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In 1979 the podium was assigned to Julius Rudel, the highly regarded maestro of the New York City Opera. Though faced with many financial constraints, Rudel's tenure was marked with emphasis on the classical repertoire as well as gala performances with Beverly Sills and Plácido Domingo. Rudel also took the BPO on a West Coast tour which produced rave reviews in the San Francisco and Los Angeles press, and made a commemorative recording with CBS Masterworks of music for the holiday season. Rudel's departure in the spring of 1984 was followed by the appointment of a dynamic and articulate young Russian emigre, Semyon Bychkov, who had been the BPO's Assistant Conductor for the previous three seasons. But this was not an ordinary promotion, as Bychkov was already singled out by the European press as the primary candidate for the helm of several great orchestras. With the support of an ambitious Board of Directors, Bychkov announced that the BPO would make its first tour of Europe. All of this was in addition to directing the BPO's 50th anniversary season and making a fine commemorative recording featuring Roberta Peters of the Metropolitan Opera. With regard to the 1988 European tour, the BPO performed two sold-out concerts in Vienna's great Musikvereinsall, as well as concerts in Geneva, Zurich, Milan, and Frankfurt and other venues in Germany and Switzerland. When Bychkov resigned to take over the Orchestre de Paris in 1989, Chilean maestro Maximiano Valdes rekindled the BPO's reputation for program variety in both the standard and contemporary repertoire. Although the Valdes era encountered serious fiscal issues, the many extant tapes of local FM broadcasts reveal Valdes' inspired orchestral style with an alluring lyrical touch. Following important administrative and fiscal advances, in 1998 the Buffalo Philharmonic regained its progressive role when it captured a rising star and appointed JoAnn Falletta as its new maestro. She was the first woman named as the music director of a major U.S. symphony orchestra. In addition to her mastery of the standard orchestral repertoire, Falletta reveals a keen enthusiasm for new and intriguing scores, both from the international panorama and from American composers, much in keeping with the distinguished history of the BPO. Under her direction, the orchestra has reinitiated a series of broadcasts on public radio, and has returned to Carnegie Hall after a long hiatus. Falletta has led the orchestra on three multi-city tours of Florida, and also conducted the orchestra at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in 2012. With Falletta, the BPO also has issued more than 40 new CDs, including several on Naxos Records. Among the celebrated soloists who have appeared with the BPO under maestro Falletta are Van Cliburn, Renée Fleming, and André Watts.

The name Atia Balba was also borne by the other two daughters of Julia and her husband praetor Marcus Atius Balbus. They were Atia's older sister Atia Balba Prima, and her younger sister was Atia Balba Tertia. As a result, she was sometimes referred to as Atia Balba Secunda to differentiate her from her two sisters. (Limited Preview of this page at Google Books)  Life  In his Dialogus de oratoribus, Tacitus notes her to be exceptionally religious and moral, and one of the most admired matrons in the history of the Republic: > In her presence no base word could be uttered without grave offence, and no > wrong deed done.

She died during her son's first consulship, in August or September 43 BC. Octavian honored her memory with a public funeral. Another Philippus, consul suffectus in 38 BC and the son of her second husband from a previous marriage, later married one of her sisters.  Marriage, offspring and descendants  Her first marriage was with Gaius Octavius, the praetor in 61 BC and then Macedonian governor. Her family lived close to Velitrae, ancestral home of the Octavii. They had two children: Octavia Minor, born in 69 BC, and the younger Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BC. Octavius died in 59 BC, when their son Gaius Octavius (future Roman emperor Augustus) was four years old. That same year Atia remarried to Lucius Marcius Philippus, consul in 56 BC. They had no known children. Many of her children's descendants became major figures of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, among them were the emperors Caligula, Claudius and Nero.

Description Skull and a jaw bone at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands Skeleton in the Miguel Mendez, Malahide, Ireland Locally known as yaki or wolai, its skin and hairless face is, with the exception of some white hair in the shoulder range, entirely jet black. Unusual for a primate, it has striking reddish-brown eyes. The long muzzle with high cheeks and the long hair tuft, or crest, at the top of the head are remarkable features. It has an \\"apelike\\" appearance due to its almost non-existent, non- visible, vestigial tail stub of only approximately . With a total body length of to and a weight of to , it is one of the smaller macaque species. Its life expectancy is estimated at approximately 15-20 years in the wild. Ecology The Celebes crested macaque is a diurnal rain forest dweller. This macaque is primarily terrestrial, spending more than 60% of its day on the ground foraging for food and socializing, while sleeping and searching for food in the trees. A celebes macaque eating leaf Tangkoko National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia The Celebes crested macaque is frugivorous, with 70% of its diet consisting of fruits. It also consumes leaves, buds, seeds, fungus, small birds and bird eggs, insects (such as beetles and caterpillars) worms, snails and the occasional small lizard or frog. Group behavior It lives typically in groups of five to twenty-five animals, and occasionally in groups of up to seventy-five animals. Smaller groups have only a single adult male, while larger groups have up to four adult males. However, adult females always outnumber adult males by about 4:1. Young adult males are forced to leave their birth group upon maturity, sometimes forming bachelor groups before seeking a connection to an existing adult mixed gender group. Communication consists of various sounds and gestures; such as the presentation of the long eyeteeth while grimacing, a clear threatening gesture. Two celebes macaques grooming each other at the Diergaarde Blijdorp in the Rotterdam, Netherlands Juvenile Celebes crested macaque at the Buffalo Zoo in Buffalo, New York The Celebes crested macaque is promiscuous, with both males and females mating multiple times with multiple partners. The receptivity of the females is clearly indicated by an extreme tumescence (swelling) and redness of their buttocks which, in contrast to the black skin color, is particularly noticeable. The gestation time is 174 days, and the birth of the usually single offspring happens in the spring when food is more plentiful. Young animals are nursed for approximately one year, becoming fully mature in three to four years, females somewhat sooner than males. Human interactions Self-portrait photograph (the \\"monkey selfie\\") Because it devastates crops and fields, the Celebes crested macaque is hunted as a pest. It is also hunted to provide bushmeat. Clearing the rain forests further threatens its survival. Its situation on the small neighbouring islands of Sulawesi (such as Bacan) is somewhat better, since these have a low human population. The total population of the macaque on Sulawesi is estimated at 4,000–6,000, while a booming population of up to 100,000 monkeys is found on Bacan. A series of survey trips to Sulawesi and the Minehasa forest area were made in 2004–2009 by Vicki Melfi, who is EEP studbook holder for these macaques, based at Paignton Zoo / the Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust. She has been monitoring population density, which has declined from over 300 individuals per square kilometre in 1980 to 20 to 60 individuals today. A conservation programme called Selamatkan Yaki—or \\"Save the Yaki\\", as this macaque is known in the local language—was launched with local partners and other conservation groups from Thailand, Germany and the Wildlife Conservation Society (based in the United States). Both Newquay Zoo and Paignton Zoo are among a number of mostly European zoos which hold ex-situ breeding populations of this animal.Selamatkan Yaki! article in Zoo News (Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust newsletter), Issue 69, Autumn 2009, p. 16. Since 2006, the Macaca Nigra Project has been studying the biology and promoting the conservation of this species. The project, a collaboration between the German Primate Center and the Bogor Agricultural Institute, is run by Antje Engelhardt and located in the Tangkoko reserve, home of the biggest crested macaque population remaining in the species' original distribution range. Nevertheless, despite being critically endangered, crested black macaque are still unprotected outside of Tangkoko reserve and they are regularly hunted and slaughtered. They are easily caught and killed as they have no fear of humans. Crested black macaque is considered a delicacy by local residents. In 2013, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford- Johnson spent time on Sulawesi, filming the monkeys at close quarters for a BBC documentary entitled \\"Meet the monkeys\\". In 2014, considerable discussion of copyright issues was generated by a \\"selfie\\" photograph taken by a Celebes crested macaque.

The dumbbell, a type of free weight, is a piece of equipment used in weight training. It can be used individually or in pairs, with one in each hand. History halteres) used in athletic games in ancient Greece, National Archaeological Museum, Athens. Roman mosaic, circa 286–305 AD. The forerunner of the dumbbell, halteres, were used in ancient Greece as lifting weights and also as weights in the ancient Greek version of the long jump. A kind of dumbbell was also used in India for more than a millennium, shaped like a club – so it was named Indian club. The design of the \\"Nal\\", as the equipment was referred to, can be seen as a halfway point between a barbell and a dumbbell. It was generally used in pairs, in workouts by wrestlers, bodybuilders, sports players, and others wishing to increase strength and muscle size. Etymology The term \\"dumbbell\\" or \\"dumb bell\\" originated in late Stuart England. In 1711 the poet Joseph Addison mentioned exercising with a \\"dumb bell\\" in an essay published in The Spectator. Although Addison elsewhere in the same publication describes having used equipment similar to the modern understanding of dumbbells, according to sport historian Jan Todd, the form of the first dumbbells remains unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary describes \\"apparatus similar to that used to ring a church bell, but without the bell, so noiseless or ‘dumb’\\", implying the action of pulling a bell rope to practise English bellringing.Oxford dictionary definition and etymology Types Selectorized dumbbells A full set of fixed-weight dumbbells By the early 17th century, the familiar shape of the dumbbell, with two equal weights attached to a handle, had appeared. There are currently three main types of dumbbell: * Adjustable dumbbells consist of a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (knurling) to improve grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a \\"spinlock\\" dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar. Nowadays, many commercially sold dumbbells are available with sophisticated, and easy-to-use methods for weight increments adjustments. *Fixed-weight dumbbells are weights created in a dumbbell shape. Inexpensive varieties consist of cast iron, sometimes coated with rubber or neoprene for comfort, and even cheaper versions consist of a rigid plastic shell that is filled with concrete. *\\"Selectorized\\" dumbbells are adjustable dumbbells whose number of plates (i.e. weight) can be easily changed when resting in the dumbbell stand. This is achieved by adjusting the number of plates that follow the handle when lifted, e.g. by turning a dial or moving a selector pin — rather than manually adding or removing plates. This makes it very easy to change the weight of the dumbbell between exercises, and the stand typically doubles as storage for the additional weights not being used for a particular exercise. =Named dumbbells= * Thomas Inch dumbbell, also known as \\"172\\" ( handle, weighs ) * Millennium dumbbell ( handle, weighs ) * Circus dumbbells: historically used in traveling circus acts, these dumbbells have exaggerated ends and wider handles, and just like normal dumbbells, come in various weights and sizes.

The low-floor design improves the accessibility of the tram for the public, and also may provide larger windows and more airspace. An accessible platform-level floor in a tram can be achieved either by using a high-floor vehicle serving high-platform tram stops, or with a true low-floor vehicle interfacing with curb level stops. Currently both types are in use, depending on the station platform infrastructure in existing rail systems. Some systems may make use of former railway alignments where use of existing high platforms is desirable, while others, particularly new systems, may not have the space to site high-level stops in urban centres. Low-floor tram configurations Trams traditionally had high floors, and these designs evolved into the tram with a low-floor centre section. Examples of this design are Amsterdam 11g/12g-trams and the Kusttrams in Belgium. The most common design of 100% low floor vehicles uses short carbody sections for the wheels and longer suspended sections. Examples of this are the Alstom Citadis and Combino. A similar, but somewhat older technique is one that has been developed by MAN. In 1990, it was the first 100% low floor tram. These trams are found in ten German cities (such as Bremen and Munich) and in the Swedish city Norrköping. In many other German cities there are trams with low floor between the outer bogies and single axle bogies under the centre section. \\"Light rail\\" type vehicles frequently have a similar configuration but with a centre bogie designed to accommodate a low floor situated under a short centre section. A more radical approach has been adopted for the City Class LRV (Citytram), where the main low floor section is only 300 mm above the rail. The low floor runs right through the articulation of both the 29 m long and 38 m Super Citytram version. In both, the corridor through the articulation is wide enough for seated passengers and a wheelchair to pass through. The City Class has been designed to turn on 15 m radius curves and to climb 10% gradients. In Austria, the Porsche designed Ultra Low Floor (ULF) Trams can \\"kneel\\" at the curbside, reducing the height from the road to only 180 mm. Wheelchair access ramp in Protram 205 WrAs tram. Low floor is approximately 360 mm high Some public transport companies have both low floor and high floor trams. They report that low floor trams have 15% higher maintenance costs for the rolling stock, and 20% higher maintenance costs for the infrastructure on average. Among the problems observed is that the missing bogies result in a higher level of wear and tear. Many low floor trams have fixed bogies which increase track wear and tear, while decreasing the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4–15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The Škoda ForCity and the newest Alstom Citadis X04 try to counter the effect with low floor pivoting bogies while maintaining 100% low floor design. Prior to the new design, pivoting bogies could only be used under high floors, hence such trams could only be part low-floor, with high- floor sections over the pivoting bogies. Historic examples Brisbane Hedley-Doyle Stepless tram, No. 301 The idea of a low-floor tram dates back to the early 20th century when a number of trolley systems began experimenting with various \\"stepless\\" designs. Perhaps the most notable is the Hedley-Doyle Stepless car introduced in 1912 for use on Broadway in Manhattan. A number of other cities also purchased Hedley-Doyle Stepless trams after seeing their success in Manhattan. Since these cars had a unique appearance compared to any other trams running at the time, they earned a number of nicknames, including hobble skirt cars, public welfare cars, and sow bellies. Typical floor heights To put things into perspective, here are some typical floor heights for public transport vehicles, old and new: * Ultra Low Floor tram — 180 mm (7 inches) * Low-floor tram — 300 mm to 350 mm (11.8 to 13.78 inches) * High- floor tram — more than 600 mm (23.62 inches) * Heavy rail rapid transit — 800 mm (31.5 inches) to 1200 mm (47.25 inches) * North American inter-city rail

A low- floor bus is a bus or trolleybus that has no steps between the ground and the floor of the bus at one or more entrances, and low floor for part or all of the passenger cabin. A bus with a partial low floor may also be referred to as a low-entry bus in some locations. Low floor refers to a bus deck that is accessible from the sidewalk with only a single step with a small height difference, caused solely by the difference between the bus deck and sidewalk. This is distinct from high-floor, a bus deck design that requires climbing one or more steps (now known as step entrance) to access the interior floor that is placed at a higher height. Being low-floor improves the accessibility of the bus for the public, particularly the elderly and people with disabilities, including those using wheelchairs and walkers. Almost all are rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with no drive shaft. Configuration Kneeling bus raising the floor before departure 288x288px =Low-floor and low-entry buses= Low-floor buses are generally divided into two major types: fully low-floor buses with a low floor throughout the length of the bus (more popular in Europe), and low-entry buses with step-free access to only a part of the bus, most commonly between the front door and the middle door (more popular in North America). In North America, both types are commonly called low-floor, as the majority of the vehicle has a low floor, without steps at the doors. The main reason for choosing a low-entry configuration is to allow better placement for the powertrain and other technical equipment in the raised floor section, in addition to allowing a more comfortable ride on rough roads. Some manufacturers use the initials LF or L in their model designations for fully low-floor models (or in the case of German manufacturers, NF or N, based on the German word Niederflur, which means low floor), and in North America buses that are partially low-floor are often also designated LF. In some countries, LE, short for Low Entry, is used by some manufacturers in their model designations for low-entry buses. =Suspension and powertrain= Most bus manufacturers achieve a low floor height by making rear-engined rear- wheel drive buses with independent front suspension, so that no axle is needed to pass under the floor of the front part of passenger compartment, or a lowered front axle. Some full low-floor buses also have a lowered rear axle, while the rear axle is not an issue on a low-entry bus. Many low-floor buses, including the Irisbus Citelis (also in Skoda 24Tr trolleybus version), have the engine in a vertical cabinet at the rear of the bus. Van Hool have a series of \\"side-engine mid-drive\\" buses that puts the engine off to one side of the cabin longitudinally between the first and the second axle, to maximize usable cabin space. The same concept was also utilized by Volvo on their B9S articulated chassis. For smaller buses, such as midibuses, the low-floor capability is achieved by placing the front wheels ahead of the entrance. One of the last types of buses to gain low-floor accessibility as standard was the minibus, where a similar front-wheel arrangement allows around 12 seats and a wheelchair space to be accommodated in very small low-floor minibuses, such as the Optare Alero and Hino Poncho. Accessibility was previously achieved in paratransit type applications, which use small vehicles with the fitment of special lifts. The inception of small low-floor buses has allowed the development of several accessible demand-responsive transport schemes using standard 'off-the-shelf' buses. A disadvantage of the low floor is accommodating the bus's own wheels. With the low floor, the wheels protrude into the passenger cabin, and need to be contained in wheel pockets of waist height, and this occupies space which would otherwise be used for seating. To allow space for technical equipment, many low-floor buses have the seats mounted on podiums, making a small step up from the floor, while others are able to mount the seats directly to the floor, avoiding the step. Seating layout for a low-floor bus therefore requires careful design. Low floor configuration is also known to have poor side to side dead load distribution within the chassis due to the asymmetrical off-centre placement of driveline components - mainly engine and transmission. As a result, many of such buses require electronically controlled air suspension to compensate the lopsided configuration. =Other features= Interior of a New Flyer low-floor bus. The floor of the front two-thirds of the bus is at curb height. left Low-floor buses usually include an area without seating (or seating that folds up) next to at least one of the doors, where wheelchairs, walkers, strollers/prams, and where allowed even bicycles, can be parked. This is sometimes not the only purpose of this area, though, as many operators employ larger standee areas for high occupancy at peak times. Despite the space existing, operators may also insist that only one or two wheelchairs or pushchairs can be accommodated unfolded, due to space/safety concerns. Low floors can be complemented by a hydraulic or pneumatic 'kneeling device', which can be used when the bus is not in motion, tilting it or lowering it at the front axle even further, often down to normal curb height. Depending on how close to the curb the bus is parked and wheelchair design, this can allow wheelchair users to board unaided. Though such technology has been available and in use on high-floor buses since the 1970s, it is of significant utility on low-floor vehicles only where it enables less-mobile passengers to board and leave the vehicle without help from others. Many vehicles are also equipped with wheel-chair lifts, or ramps which, when combined with a low floor, can provide a nearly level entry. An interesting implementation of the low floor design exists in Australia, where Custom Coaches makes a \\"Hybrid\\" variant of its CB60 bodywork. These buses combine a smaller low floor area with a small underfloor bin for some luggage. Whilst these buses do not provide a full amount of luggage space, they can be used to house more luggage than what can be held inside the bus itself. Another drawback is the arrangement means the section of the bus that is at curb height is very short-consisting of enough space to house the wheelchair area and then rising up, to accommodate the luggage bin. These buses also lack the ability to have a center door. Alternatives Many bus rapid transit systems employ a level boarding by using high-floor buses stopping at \\"station\\" style bus stops. Specially raised sections of curb may also be used to achieve accessibility with lesser low floor models, although this is more expensive for the operator, and only attractive for regular busy scheduled routes. For infrequent routes or routes with hail and ride sections, or demand responsive transport, raised curbs would only be feasible in terminuses. Some transit agencies refused to order low-floor buses altogether, such as New Jersey Transit and MUNI owing to terrain conditions in the service area. DART still has a preference for high floor buses. Although New York City Transit runs some 40-foot low-floors, it originally refused to order low-floor buses, namely D60LFs from New Flyer, after the D60HF, a high floor model, was discontinued mid-delivery. However, they have demonstrated both the D60LF and NovaBus LFSA, the latter of which they have decided to order. Asia =India= Bengaluru Bangalore is one of the first cities in India that introduced Low Floor buses. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, BMTC operates many services using the premium Volvo 8400LE Low- floor buses. These buses are air-conditioned, and offer features such as automatic transmission, kneeling and wheel-chair ramp, typical of modern city buses. They are also fitted with LED display boards as well as ITS to announce the halts. The corporation also had tried Mercedes-Benz Low-Floor buses as well as Ashok Leyland ULE coaches, but chose to stick to the Volvo offering. In order to keep the bus ticket prices low, the BMTC operates the majority of their services using Non-Airconditioned Semi-Low Floor (SLF) buses that have a floor height of 650mm as against the 400mm floor height of the true Low-Floor buses. These buses are from Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors, with future procurements planned to be from Eicher (VECV). These cheaper alternative to low-floor buses do not have kneeling or wheel-chair accessible ramps, but they have air suspension and use the same or better seats as those found in the Volvo buses. They also feature manual transmission as against automatic transmission New Delhi Low floor AC Buses in Delhi With the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of dedicated corridors for the service, bus service is set to improve. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has started introducing air-conditioned buses and brand new low-floor buses (with floor height of and even higher on one third area as against available internationally) on city streets to replace the conventional buses. A revamp plan is underway to improve bus-shelters in the city and to integrate GPS systems in DTC buses and bus stops so as to provide reliable information about bus arrivals. The Delhi Government decided to expedite this process and procured 6,600 low floor buses for the DTC before commonwealth games in 2010. Kolkata Kolkata has an extensive network of government run buses. Recently air-conditioned buses have been introduced by the WBSTC. These buses connects places like the Kolkata Airport, Barasat (Capital Town of North Suburb), New Town, Salt Lake, Howrah, Santragachi (a station on the Howrah-Kharagpur railway line), Kudgaht and Tollygunge. The road network in Kolkata is vast. Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, air conditioned buses have been included as a part of travel comfort to commuters. Air-conditioned buses are operated by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) directly & through outsourcing. These buses are served by Tata Marcopolo Buses and Volvo Low Floor Buses. The V Series and VS series bus routes are served by the AC volvo bus and MW series are served by the Tata Marcopolo buses operated by WBSTC. AC Marcopolo buses serve the MH series route operated by WBHIDCO and the MB series route operated by BHBL. Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) also run AC Volvo Bus & Ashok Leylan JanBus. Jaipur (Jaipur) * Non-AC : Several Non-AC buses are available across the city. There are 10 routes.7 are radial and 10 are circular * AC: There are two AC routes namely AC-1 and AC-2. JCTSL operates buses from Ashok Leyland =Japan= Japanese low-floor bus \\"omnibus\\" in Hamamatsu In Japan, a low-floor bus is called \\"non-step bus (ノンステップバス)\\". Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation used to calling a low-floor bus \\"no-step bus (ノーステップバス)\\".Japanese \\"ノーステップバス\\" At Enshu Railway Company in Hamamatsu Area, a low-floor bus is called \\"omnibus (オムニバス)\\", \\"cho-teisho bus (超低床バス; very low- floor bus)\\" and \\"cho-teisho omnibus (超低床オムニバス; very low-floor omnibus)\\". Japanese government calls a low-floor bus \\"cho-teisho non-step bus (超低床ノンステップバス; very low-floor non-step bus)\\". The term non-step bus may also refer to a high floor bus where the floor is flat in order to align with the high platforms in certain Bus Rapid Transit systems. Thereby, referring to it as a non-step high floor bus. Europe =United Kingdom= Arriva Southend Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart SLF Optare Solo 880 in Bracknell bus station in June 2010 National Express Caetano Levante bodied Scania K340EB 6x2 with wheelchair lift at Metrocentre bus rally in May 2009 The Dennis Dart SLF (Super Low Floor) marked the wholesale introduction of single-deck low floor buses in the United Kingdom in 1995, after many small-scale demonstrator usages. Low floor buses were rapidly introduced on high-profile routes, notably becoming a requirement for London Buses contracts. The Optare Solo introduced in 1997 marked another step change with inroads into smaller usages traditionally served by minibuses. The final phase came with low floor double-deckers the Dennis Trident 2 and Volvo B7TL entering the mass market, even though they were introduced after the Optare Spectra. Due to the deregulated nature of the public transport system in the UK, adoption of the higher cost low floor buses was usually in conjunction with some sort of grant or quality partnership with a local authority, as the profitability of many routes was not high enough to justify conversion based purely on increased revenue. It has been reported however that adoption of so-called Easy Access buses does have a positive effect of ridership and revenue levels. Under the Transport Act 1985 the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) (or commonly DiPTAC) was established to provide independent consultation on accessibility issues.UK government In the same year, the first low floor bus specification was drafted by DPTAC. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 provided for the completion of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000,Transport for you which specified that all new public service vehicles over 22 seats should be low floor from 31 December 2000, with smaller vehicles mandated from 1 January 2005. The 2000 regulations do not require retro-fitting of pre-existing vehicles or the enforced sale of non-compliant existing vehicles, allowing operators to retain a high floor vehicle until \\"the end of their economic life\\". In reality, as the prevalence of low floor buses spreads, combined with grants/incentives, it is likely that the prevalence of high floor vehicles in the national fleet will markedly reduce before all buses were de-registered by 27 October 2014. In the past, in times of reduced economic investment, it was not uncommon for service buses to be used for 15 to 20 years. While some coaches have been produced with a small front low floor section at the driver's level, most coaches in the UK are being made accessible through the use of wheelchair lifts, with the 2005 Caetano Levante being one of the largest introductions.BBC While another widely stated benefit of low floor buses is quicker boarding for able-bodied passengers due to the lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to alight before boarding, leading to an increase in dwell times. North America =United States= 1999 New Flyer D40LF in the Aurora Village Transit Center in Shoreline in June 2010. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act is credited with motivating the development of low-floor buses, directly affecting the standardized design of the Transbus Program, which concluded with the introduction of so-called 'interim' Advanced Design Buses with a lower floor height but which required lifts to board passengers in wheelchairs. The first low-floor (low-entry) buses to be delivered were the New Flyer Low Floor D40LF, to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1991. The New Flyer LF was derived from the . Other competitors followed suit, with the Orion VI (1995), Nova Bus LF Series (1996, also derived from the Den Oudsten B85), Gillig Low Floor (1997, derived from a shuttle bus design for the Hertz rental car agency), and Neoplan AN440L (1990/94/99). By 2008, most new bus orders in the United States were for low-floor buses. Oceania =Australia= Brisbane In Brisbane, all TransLink buses are of a low-floor design. A small number of higher capacity articulated low-floor buses are used to service the city's southern busways. Sydney In Sydney, routes may be operated by both high-floor buses and low-entry ones. Selected routes can be set aside specifically for low-entry buses which are considered to be wheelchair-accessible routes. A recent all-low-entry bus network is the Metrobus system.

Life Born in Montreal, Quebec, she studied at The Study, a premier independent school for girls, and was educated at the liberal arts Vassar College (BA in 1948). At the age of nine she was already committed to sculpture and her drawing skills were commented upon as remarkable early on in life. And at eleven she began exhibiting in annual juried exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts and the Société des Sculpteurs du Canada. While reading architecture history in New York she became engaged with the connections of art and architecture which would last a lifetime. On 17 May 1949, in Montreal, she married Jean Lambert, a French-German\\"Lambert & Co.: 'Some Mistakes'—Head of Investment House Looks Back on Losses\\", The New York Times, 1 April 1967, pages 31 and 44 economic consultant and the only son of Adolphe Lambert of Elmhurst, Queens, New York.\\"Phyllis Bronfman Wed in Montreal\\", The New York Times, 18 May 1949, page L-31Canadian Jewish Review, 16 September 1949, page 18 Jean Lambert later became a banker, founding Lambert & Company, an investment bank in New York City; he was not Baron Jean Lambert of the Belgian banking family.Jean Lambert married, in 1963, as his second wife, Jacqueline Reille, the former wife of Christian, Count de Fels, per \\"Jean Lambert, Investor, Marries Countess Reille\\", The New York Times, 25 November 1963, page L-22 The couple divorced in 1954. After the divorce she decided to stay on in Paris, living and working alone in a studio on her art and sculpting.Citizen Lambert: Joan of Architecture, directed by American documentary filmmaker Teri Wehn-Damisch, 2007 In 1951 Lambert's father Samuel Bronfman established Cemp Investments, a holding company for his four children, in which Phyllis was given a 22% ownership stake. It controlled the family's distilling empire, The Seagram Company Ltd., which over time controlled billions of dollars in liquor, real estate, oil and gas, and chemical companies.Nicolas Faith, The Bronfmans: The Rise and Fall of the House of Seagram. St. Martin's Griffin, 2007. . Retrieved 2015-04-22  Work  Lambert was closely involved with the design of the iconic Seagram Building in New York While living in Paris, the Seagram Company Ltd was planning a new headquarters in New York under her fathers instructions. During her time in Paris she had come into contact with the newest artistic and architectural movements of the time. She was vehemently against the building that had already been designed for the plot by Pereira and Luckman Architects. In an eight-paged letter (dated June 28, 1954) to her father the only 27-year-old Phyllis managed to encourage him to re-think the initial project. She was given the mandate to find a suitable alternative and after an extended research lasting six weeks Mies van der Rohe was brought forward as the new candidate. He received the project and became her mentor supporting her in her wish to become an architect. From 1954-1958 she was immersed in the process of designing and building the Seagram Building on Park Avenue in New York City. In 1958 she entered the Yale School of Architecture but then changed to the Illinois Institute of Technology, which she felt better suited what she wanted to learn. 1958 was also the year when Mies van der Rohe, who had served as the head of the Department of Architecture at IIT since 1938, resignedhttps://www.iit.edu/about/history/historic-architecture from his position. Lambert later became the consultant to the Seagram Building, entrusted with its maintenance including the supervision and the curation of all exhibitions and collections, until 2000. After she obtained her master's degree in 1963, her family commissioned her to design an arts center in Montreal to be known as the Saidye Bronfman Centre, in honor of her mother. Lambert designed a ‘Misian Structure’. Lambert opened the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Shaughnessy Village after advocating for preserving the neighbourhood and saving the building from demolition After the demolition of the Van Horne Mansion on Sherbrooke Street in 1973 twenty-three citizen groups formed Sauvons Montréal. Lambert became one of the advocates in the efforts to revitalize the struggling Shaughnessy Village district. In 1975, she founded the heritage preservation group Heritage Montreal. (She served as its first president until 1983.) Héritage Montréal raised funds so that conservation groups could take action. Their tools to stop demolition included marching in the streets, publishing ads and booklets and working with residents. They developed Canada's largest non-profit cooperative housing renovation, Milton-Parc. Lambert also saved Shaughnessy House from demolition by buying it. In 1989 the 19th century mansion became part of the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA). She considered investment in renovating low-to medium-income neighbourhoods as important as the conservation of monuments or building anew. Since 1997 she held the Fonds d’investissement Montréal (FIM). It achieved in bringing private sector investment to communitarian housing beyond the limits of government programs. In 1979, she founded the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA), an influential museum and research centre in Montreal's Shaughnessy Village neighbourhood, and donated 750,000 shares of Seagram to help fund the Centre. It houses extensive collections of architectural drawings, books, photographs, and archival materials. The centre's utmost priority is the preservation of architectural heritage. She served on the board of directors of Cemp's subsidiary, Cadillac Fairview for which she later picketed the offices of project developer. Again she suggested to work with Mies and supported what was to be known as the Toronto-Dominion Centre.\\"A Personal Stamp on the Skyline, Mark Lamster, New York Times, April 3, 2013 Her work also includes serving as developer on the restoration of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles by architect Gene Summers.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It produces a metabolite with a long half-life, which may stay in the bloodstream for days. Flurazepam was patented in 1968 and came into medical use the same year. Flurazepam, developed by Roche Pharmaceuticals was one of the first benzo hypnotics (sleeping pills) to be marketed.  Medical uses  right Flurazepam is officially indicated for mild to moderate insomnia and as such it is used for short-term treatment of patients with mild to moderate insomnia such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep. Intermediate half-life benzodiazepines are also useful for patients with difficulty in maintaining sleep (e.g. loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam). Flurazepam was temporarily unavailable in the United States when its sole producer, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, discontinued making it in January 2019. In October of 2019, the FDA informed pharmacies that they could expect to be resupplied by manufacturers in early to mid December 2019. As of this date, Flurazepam is now again available in the United States.  Side effects  The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and ataxia. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with alcoholic beverages or any other substance that can cause drowsiness. Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady- state plasma levels are attained. A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. = Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal = A review paper found that long-term use of flurazepam is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia and central nervous system (CNS) related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used for a short time period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as fosazepam, and nitrazepam lost some of their effect after seven days administration in psychogeriatric patients. Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and barbiturates can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics. After discontinuation of flurazepam a rebound effect or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur about four days after discontinuation of medication.  Contraindications and special caution  Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. = Elderly = Flurazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including flurazepam, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy in elderly persons. Tolerability in elderly patients, however, is improved marginally in that benzodiazepines have moderately higher risks of falls, memory problems, and disinhibition (\\"paradoxical agitation\\") when compared to non-benzodiazepine sedatives. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Chronic use of sedative-hypnotic drugs for the management of insomnia does not have an evidence base and has been discouraged due to concerns including potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of sedative hypnotics has been determined to be no better than placebo after 3 months of therapy and worse than placebo after 6 months of therapy.NEJM, 1983, 1994, et seq.  Pharmacology  Flurazepam is a \\"classical\\" benzodiazepine; some other classical benzodiazepines include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Flurazepam generates an active metabolite, N-Desalkylflurazepam with a very long elimination half-life. Flurazepam could be therefore unsuitable as a sleeping medication for some individuals due to next-day sedation; however, this same effect may also provide next-day anxiety relief. Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of flurazepam, such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Flurazepam is lipophilic, is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effect of flurazepam is to increase the effect of GABA at the GABAA receptor via binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor causing an increase influx of chloride ions into the GABAA neuron. Flurazepam is contraindicated in pregnancy. It is recommended to withdraw flurazepam during breast feeding, as flurazepam is excreted in breast milk.  Society and culture  = Drug misuse = Flurazepam is a drug with potential for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur, either recreational misuse where the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice. = Legal status = Flurazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

Like other absorption spectroscopies, XAS techniques follow Beer's law. The X-ray absorption coefficient of a material as a function of energy is obtained using X-rays of a narrow energy resolution are directed at a sample and the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity is recorded as the incident x-ray energy is incremented. When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Every element has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons because of the high intensity of synchrotron X-ray sources allow the concentration of the absorbing element to reach as low as a few parts per million. Absorption would be undetectable if the source is too weak. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids. Background EXAFS spectra are displayed as plots of the absorption coefficient of a given material versus energy, typically in a 500 – 1000 eV range beginning before an absorption edge of an element in the sample. The x-ray absorption coefficient is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region before and after the absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge). The normalized absorption spectra are often called XANES spectra. These spectra can be used to determine the average oxidation state of the element in the sample. The XANES spectra are also sensitive to the coordination environment of the absorbing atom in the sample. Finger printing methods have been used to match the XANES spectra of an unknown sample to those of known \\"standards\\". Linear combination fitting of several different standard spectra can give an estimate to the amount of each of the known standard spectra within an unknown sample. X-ray absorption spectra are produced over the range of 200 – 35,000 eV. The dominant physical process is one where the absorbed photon ejects a core photoelectron from the absorbing atom, leaving behind a core hole. The atom with the core hole is now excited. The ejected photoelectron's energy will be equal to that of the absorbed photon minus the binding energy of the initial core state. The ejected photoelectron interacts with electrons in the surrounding non-excited atoms. If the ejected photoelectron is taken to have a wave-like nature and the surrounding atoms are described as point scatterers, it is possible to imagine the backscattered electron waves interfering with the forward-propagating waves. The resulting interference pattern shows up as a modulation of the measured absorption coefficient, thereby causing the oscillation in the EXAFS spectra. A simplified plane-wave single-scattering theory has been used for interpretation of EXAFS spectra for many years, although modern methods (like FEFF, GNXAS) have shown that curved-wave corrections and multiple-scattering effects can not be neglected. The photelectron scattering amplitude in the low energy range (5-200 eV) of the photoelectron kinetic energy become much larger so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the XANES (or NEXAFS) spectra. The wavelength of the photoelectron is dependent on the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom. The wavelength changes as a function of the energy of the incoming photon. The phase and amplitude of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally excited) atom by analyzing these EXAFS data. Experimental considerations Since EXAFS requires a tunable x-ray source, data are always collected at synchrotrons, often at beamlines which are especially optimized for the purpose. The utility of a particular synchrotron to study a particular solid depends on the brightness of the x-ray flux at the absorption edges of the relevant elements.  Applications  XAS is an interdisciplinary technique and its unique properties, as compared to x-ray diffraction, have been exploited for understanding the details of local structure in: * glass, amorphous and liquid systems * solid solutions * doping and ionic implantation of materials for electronics * local distortions of crystal lattices * organometallic compounds * metalloproteins * metal clusters * vibrational dynamics * ions in solutions * speciation of elements Examples EXAFS is, like XANES, a highly sensitive technique with elemental specificity. As such, EXAFS is an extremely useful way to determine the chemical state of practically important species which occur in very low abundance or concentration. Frequent use of EXAFS occurs in environmental chemistry, where scientists try to understand the propagation of pollutants through an ecosystem. EXAFS can be used along with accelerator mass spectrometry in forensic examinations, particularly in nuclear non- proliferation applications. EXAFS has been used to study of uranium chemistry in glass. History A very detailed, balanced and informative account about the history of EXAFS (originally called Kossel's structures) is given by R. Stumm von Bordwehr. A more modern and accurate account of the history of XAFS (EXAFS and XANES) is given by the leader of the group that developed the modern version of EXAFS in an award lecture by Edward A. Stern.

As a parody of the Rat Pack or Brat Pack, they are considered part of what the radio show became notable for. Members tend to be unusual in some way such as being blatantly racist, mentally disabled, having a comical appearance, voice or ability. As of 2016, twenty four living individuals are designated \\"Wack Packers\\" (along with a number of deceased). Not every regular guest on or caller to the show is considered a member, nor are any of the show's staff members; Stern has stated that Wack Packers are not defined by having any disability or peculiarity, but by their inability to understand why they are funny. Through their appearances on the radio show, some Wack Packers have gained notoriety for personal appearances around the country and occasionally, played roles in films and television programs.Mintzer, p. 88 History In the 1993 book Private Parts, Howard Stern lists early members of the Wack Pack, including Irene the Leather Weather Lady, who is essentially the first Wack Packer, having met Stern in May 1980 when he was broadcasting from WWWW in Detroit, Michigan. Upon the introduction of Fred the Elephant Boy on the radio show on November 28, 1988, among a collection of others, Stern began calling the group of show personalities the \\"Wack Pack\\" on July 6, 1990, as documented in Stern's The History of Howard Stern radio series. Since moving to Sirius XM Radio, Stern has offered some members of the Wack Pack their own shows. Official list On February 24, 2015, Stern and crew voted on an \\"official\\" list of Wack Pack members. =Living Wack Packers= The following individuals were determined as official Wack Pack members: *Angry Alice (formerly Crazy Alice) *Asian Pete *Ass Napkin Ed *Beetlejuice, named \\"Greatest Wack Packer of All Time\\" (Lester Green) *Bigfoot (Mark Shaw, Jr., not to be confused with the late actor Matthew McGrory, who previously had the name \\"Bigfoot\\" on the show.) *Fred the Elephant Boy (Fred Schreiber) *Gary the Conqueror (Gary Loudermilk, previously known as Gary the Retard) *High Pitch Erik (Erik Bleaman) *High Register Sean (named in 2019) *Jeff the Drunk (Jeff Curro, also known as Jeff the Bore) *Jeff the Vomit Guy (Jeff Levy) *John the Stutterer (not to be confused with former staff member and Tonight Show announcer Stuttering John Melendez) *Marfan Mike (Mike Diamond) *Mark the Bagger (Mark Rothenberger) *Medicated Pete (Pete McHeffey) *Melrose Larry Green *Miss Howard Stern (Andrea Ownbey) *Monotone Matt *Siobhan the Transsexual *Sour Shoes (Michael DelCampo) *Tan Mom (Patricia Krentcil) *Underdog Lady (Suzanne Muldowney) *Wendy the Slow Adult (formerly Wendy the Retard) =Former Wack Packers= *Hanzi (Imran Khan) (permanently banned from show, April 2016) =\\"Not Wack Pack Material\\"= The following individuals were at one time considered Wack Pack members.

De Selby (spelled \\"de Selby\\" in The Third Policeman and \\"De Selby\\" in The Dalkey Archive) is a fictional character originally created by Flann O'Brien for his novel The Third Policeman in which the nameless narrator intends to use the proceeds of murder and robbery to publish his commentaries on de Selby — a crackpot savant who theorizes, among other things, that the earth is actually shaped like a sausage.NPR Books The Funniest, and Scariest, Book Ever Written CHRIS LEHMANN (2006) https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5684946 O’Brien's text and footnotes mention a number of de Selby's works including Golden Hours, The Country Album, A Memoir of Garcia, Layman’s Atlas and the Codex. The fictional Bassett and Hatchjaw wrote biographies Lux Mundi: A memoir of de Selby and de Selby’s Life and Times both lost. Le Fournier, du Garbandier, Kraus and the Le Clerque are supposed sources of de Selby material, but their works (suiting the fiction) were lost.Irish Philosophy http://www.irishphilosophy.com/2014/04/01/de-selby-ireland/ As discussed in Irish Philosophy, de Selby’ believed human existence was “a succession of static experiences each infinitely brief” and “a journey is a hallucination” which he demonstrated by travelling from Bath to Folkestone by means of picture postcards of the supposed route, barometric instruments, clocks and a device to regulate gaslight to simulate sunlight at various “times” of day. Another theory of de Selby's was that mirrors held the secret to eternity, claiming a huge array of parallel mirrors allowed him to see his own face as a boy of twelve. Described as an eminent \\"physicist, ballistician, philosopher and psychologist\\", de Selby is known for his paradoxically non-scientific beliefs and personality. De Selby serves as an unseen character in The Third Policeman, where he is discussed at length in references and footnotes which tenuously link his unorthodox theories and areas of research to the plot. (In one footnote, he attempts to dilute water; in another, he posits that night is caused by the accumulation of \\"black air\\".) O'Brien's novel The Dalkey Archive focussed on de Selby himself. De Selby has a host of critical analyzers – the narrator among them – many of whom have deeply conflicting opinions of his esoteric thoughts. Although generally held in high regard by these people (many of whom hate each other), he is thought by many to have had regrettable lapses and is even called, by implication, a \\"nincompoop\\". In The Third Policeman one of de Selby's biographers is quoted as saying \\"The beauty of reading a page of de Selby is that it leads one inescapably to the happy conviction that one is not, of all nincompoops, the greatest.\\" In The Dalkey Archive, de Selby develops a substance (\\"D.M.P.\\") capable of extracting all oxygen from an airtight enclosure, thus disrupting the sequentiality of time, incidentally making it possible to produce fine mature whiskey in a week. De Selby vows to use the substance to destroy the world in the name of God. \\"de Selby\\" and his commentators are frequently cited in the footnotes of Robert Anton Wilson's novel The Widow's Son. Wilson later included Professor de Selby as the main character in his short story \\"The Horror on Howth Hill\\" where de Selby has a conversation with J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs.

Paul Drennan Cravath joined the firm in 1899, and devised the \\"Cravath System\\", combining a distinct method of hiring, training, and compensating lawyers. His name was added to the firm name in 1901 and, in 1944, after a series of name changes, the Cravath, Swaine & Moore name was established and has not been altered since. Cravath has represented noted American inventors Samuel F.B. Morse, in the late 1840s; Cyrus McCormick, Elias Howe, and Charles Goodyear in the 1850s; and George Westinghouse in the 1880s. Some current client relationships that began in the 1800s are with CBS, JPMorgan, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The firm has had a long record of clients in the US railroad industry beginning with the New York & Erie and Union Pacific railroads, and express delivery businesses such as Adams, Southern, and Wells Fargo. Its 19th century history includes the 1808 insanity defense of William Freeman for the murder of John G. Van Nest, the 1848 Jones v. Van Zandt challenge to the constitutionality of slavery, and the Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company tax case of 1895. Cases of mention before the Supreme, appellate and Chancery courts in more recent decades have been Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., Westfed Holdings Inc. v. United States, and City of Providence v. First Citizens BancShares Inc. et al. Important litigation work with IBM has included two landmark antitrust cases, one of which was a 13-year battle dubbed by Time magazine as “the case of the century.\\", The firm has represented entities in the United Kingdom and Europe since the 1820s from the Bank of England, to landmark public offerings by EU predecessors since the 1950s. HM Treasury, Grupo Modelo, Santander, and HDFC Bank are among more recent international clients. Cravath drew attention to its bankruptcy practice on November 10, 2010, by offering free representation in advance of a likely Chapter 9 filing for Harrisburg, PA. The firm's restructuring work traces back to clients such as Goodyear in 1921. After their 1916 reorganization of corporations lectures before the Bar of the City of New York, Paul D. Cravath and William D. Guthrie were reviewed to be \\"men of wide experience in these matters,\\" and several of their partners including Alexander I. Henderson and Robert T. Swaine \\"ranked among the leaders of the reorganization bar.\\" In November 2014, Cravath handled three M&A; transactions in one day, spanning advertising, spirits, and pharmaceutical industries; and acted as legal advisor in a recently announced deal backed by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that will create the third-largest food and beverage company in North America. Other significant representations have included legal work necessary to form NBC, United Airlines in its merger with Continental Airlines, the world's largest airline, to Unilever in its acquisition of Alberto-Culver. In 2010, its litigation department won summary judgment for Morgan Stanley on its breach of contract claim against Discover Financial Services. In a subsequent settlement, Discover agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $775 million to resolve the litigation. In the same year they successfully represented Barnes & Noble in a landmark \\"poison pill\\" trial. In the past several decades Cravath has represented Netscape in its antitrust suit against Microsoft, resulting in a $750 million settlement; major merger and acquisition deals, such as the DuPont-Conoco merger, the Ford-Jaguar merger, the Bristol-Myers-Squibb merger, the Time-Warner merger, and the AOL- Time-Warner merger; and two famed libel suits: defending Time Inc. against Israeli General Ariel Sharon, and also defending CBS against U.S. Army General William Westmoreland. Unlike others, Cravath has remained a relatively small firm. Its approximately 500 lawyers are located primarily in the New York Office, with a few dozen in the London office, which opened in 1973. The firm opened a Hong Kong office in 1994, closing it nine years later. In 2015, Cravath, Swaine and Moore was the victim of what the company described as a \\"limited breach\\" of its computer network, which The New York Times connected to a 2016 court case against three Chinese hackers who had made more than $4 million from insider information about merger deals.

Hiring Under the Cravath System, the firm is known for focusing its hiring on associates straight from law school, with a strong emphasis on grades, then over years of apprenticeship rotations, immersing them in details of every aspect of corporate law practice. Under this philosophy, lateral hires are rare, with some exceptions. In 2005, Cravath hired Andrew W. Needham, formerly a tax partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher,Cravath Hires Tax Partner, Its First Lateral in Decades as the first lateral partner since Herbert L. Camp, also a tax partner, from the now-defunct Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine in 1987. Camp, however, had previously been a Cravath associate and is therefore not considered a true lateral because he started his career there. Before that, Roswell Magill, a former Treasury Department official, became a Cravath tax partner in 1943. In 2007, the firm brought in Richard Levin from Skadden, Arps to boost its new bankruptcy practice.Cravath starts a bankruptcy practice In 2011, Cravath hired Christine A.

'''  Description  This is a direct improvement upon a first-come first-served (FCFS) algorithm. The drive maintains an incoming buffer of requests, and tied with each request is a cylinder number of the request. Lower cylinder numbers indicate that the cylinder is closer to the spindle, while higher numbers indicate the cylinder is farther away. The shortest seek first algorithm determines which request is closest to the current position of the head, and then services that request next.  Analysis  The shortest seek first algorithm has the direct benefit of simplicity and is clearly advantageous in comparison to the FIFO method, in that overall arm movement is reduced, resulting in lower average response time. However, since the buffer is always getting new requests, these can skew the service time of requests that may be farthest away from the disk head's current location, if the new requests are all close to the current location; in fact, starvation may result, with the faraway requests never being able to make progress. The elevator algorithm is one way of reducing arm movement/response time, and ensuring consistent servicing of requests.

It is the process in which free radicals \\"steal\\" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage. This process proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism. It most often affects polyunsaturated fatty acids, because they contain multiple double bonds in between which lie methylene bridges (-CH2-) that possess especially reactive hydrogen atoms. As with any radical reaction, the reaction consists of three major steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. The chemical products of this oxidation are known as lipid peroxides or lipid oxidation products (LOPs).  Initiation  537x537px Initiation is the step in which a fatty acid radical is produced. The most notable initiators in living cells are reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as OH· and HOO·, which combines with a hydrogen atom to make water and a fatty acid radical.  Propagation The fatty acid radical is not a very stable molecule, so it reacts readily with molecular oxygen, thereby creating a peroxyl-fatty acid radical. This radical is also an unstable species that reacts with another free fatty acid, producing a different fatty acid radical and a lipid peroxide, or a cyclic peroxide if it had reacted with itself. This cycle continues, as the new fatty acid radical reacts in the same way.  Termination  When a radical reacts with a non-radical, it always produces another radical, which is why the process is called a \\"chain reaction mechanism\\". The radical reaction stops when two radicals react and produce a non-radical species. This happens only when the concentration of radical species is high enough for there to be a high probability of collision of two radicals. Living organisms have different molecules that speed up termination by neutralizing free radicals and, therefore, protecting the cell membrane. One important antioxidant is vitamin E. Another important antioxidant is vitamin C. Other anti-oxidants made within the body include the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase.  Final products of lipid peroxidation  The end products of lipid peroxidation are reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), the second one being known also as \\"second messenger of free radicals\\" and major bioactive marker of lipid peroxidation, due to its numerous biological activities resembling activities of reactive oxygen h species.http://informahealthcare.com/toc/fra/44/10  Hazards  If not terminated fast enough, there will be damage to the cell membrane, which consists mainly of lipids. Phototherapy may cause hemolysis by rupturing red blood cell cell membranes in this way. In addition, end-products of lipid peroxidation may be mutagenic and carcinogenic. For instance, the end-product malondialdehyde reacts with deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine in DNA, forming DNA adducts to them, primarily M1G. The toxicity of lipid hydroperoxides to animals is best illustrated by the lethal phenotype of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) knockout mice. These animals do not survive past embryonic day 8, indicating that the removal of lipid hydroperoxides is essential for mammalian life.  Inhibiting lipid peroxidation  Antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E may inhibit lipid peroxidation. An alternative method employs deuteration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) at the methylene bridges (bis-allylic sites) between double bonds, which leads to the inhibition of the chain reaction courtesy of a kinetic isotope effect. Such D-PUFAs, for example, 11,11-D2-ethyl linoleate, suppress lipid peroxidation even at relatively low levels of incorporation into membranes.  Tests  Certain diagnostic tests are available for the quantification of the end-products of lipid peroxidation, to be specific, malondialdehyde (MDA). The most commonly used test is called a TBARS Assay (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay). Thiobarbituric acid reacts with malondialdehyde to yield a fluorescent product. However, there are other sources of malondialdehyde, so this test is not completely specific for lipid peroxidation. In recent years, development of immunochemical detection of HNE-histidine adducts opened more advanced methodological possibilities for qualitative and quantitative detection of lipid peroxidation in various human and animal tissues as well as in body fluids, including human serum and plasma samples.

He was a longtime associate editor at The Oregonian in Portland, Oregon, and he served as Poet laureate of Oregon from 1951 until his death.Oregon State Poet Laureate from the Library of Congress website Early life Ben Lampman was born on August 12, 1886, in Barron, Wisconsin. His father, H. H. Lampman, owned a newspaper in Barron. The family moved to Neche, North Dakota, when Ben was 4 years old, and his father founded another newspaper in Neche after arriving there. As a boy, he worked in his father's print shop. He left home at age 15 and worked in the wheat country of Canada. He returned to North Dakota. At the age of 19,1930; Census Place: Portland, Multnomah, Oregon; Roll: 1952; Page: 2B; Enumeration District: 345; Image: 534.0 he married Lena Sheldon (his same age), a New York City resident who had moved to the Dakotas to become a school teacher.imprints101-170 They remained married for the remainder of his life. Career His first work in newspaper writing took place when he was 19 years old (1905 or 1906), when he and another young man co-founded the Michigan City Arena, a newspaper in Michigan City, North Dakota. He worked on the Arena for seven years, writing editorials and columns and helping to manage the business. In 1912, Lampman moved from North Dakota to Oregon to become manager and publisher of the Gold Hill News, a weekly newspaper in Gold Hill, Oregon. His writing caught the attention of Paul Kelty, then the news editor of Portland's The Oregonian, who recommended Lampman to editor-in-chief Edgar B. Piper. He was hired, moved to Portland, and began working for The Oregonian on February 1, 1916. For his first 14 months at the paper, he covered police- related news, but also wrote editorials from time to time. In 1920, he published an account of the 1919 Centralia Massacre. In additional to part- time editorial writing, he worked as a reporter and feature writer for The Oregonian until 1922, when the paper made him a full-time editorial writer and an associate editor. He also wrote nature essays in The Oregonian. His stories and essays also appeared in national magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post. Some of his essays about life in Portland were collected in his 1942 book At the End of the Car Line. In 1943 he won an O. Henry Award for his short story \\"Blinker Was a Good Dog\\"O. Henry Award Winners 1919-2000 from the Random House website which originally appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. Some of his papers and manuscripts are now in the collection of the library of the University of Oregon. Others reside at Lewis and Clark College and the Oregon Historical Society. The Lewis and Clark Collection also contains, on loan, from the family of Ben's long-time friend, Elizabeth Salway Ryan, Ben's typewriter, his trademark glasses, a complete set of proofs of all 14 of his books and many more items. Lampman also wrote a column in The Oregonian entitled \\"Where to Bury A Dog\\" which is frequently cited in pet memorials. It was included in How Could I Be Forgetting, a 1926 compilation of the author's essays and poems.US Catalog of Copyright Entries (Renewals) Books from 1926 (titles starting with H, I & J) from ibiblio In total, he authored six books. Lampman was still an associate editor at The Oregonian in early 1951, when a stroke took him off the job, eventually leading to retirement. He was named poet laureate of Oregon on February 20, 1951. In the 1980s, Elizabeth Salway Ryan wrote a biography, The Magic of Ben Hur Lampman. The typescript was published in a very limited edition by Grandson Mark Anders Kronquist and Daughter Sally Ryan Tomlinson. Copies of the first edition typescript are in the collections of the University of Oregon, The Lake Oswego Public Library, the Library of Congress and the Oregon Historical Society. In 2011, as a part of the celebration, Lewis and Clark College printed several hundred copies of the typescript. Family As of the 1930 U.S. Census, he and his wife, Lena, had one son and two daughters: Herbert Lampman, Caroline S. Lampman, and Hope H. Lampman. Son Herbert Sheldon Lampman (March 18, 1907 – June 30, 1943), a naturalist, also became a writer and journalist, and was The Oregonian wildlife editor and one of its feature writers for about 12 years until his death in 1943 at the age of just 36. Death Lampman died in Portland on January 24, 1954. He had been in a nursing home for the last two years of his life, following a series of cerebral hemorrhages.

Taking their name from the Mohawks,A visit to England by certain Native American chiefs in 1710, 'the Four Kings of Canada', led to street gangs giving themselves names reminiscent of American tribes, such as 'Mohocks' (Mohawks). they were said to kill or disfigure their male victims and sexually assault their female victims. The matter came to a head in 1712 when a bounty of £100 was issued by the royal court for their capture. According to Lady Wentworth, \\"They put an old woman into a hogshead, and rolled her down a hill; they cut off some noses, others' hands, and several barbarous tricks, without any provocation. They are said to be young gentlemen; they never take any money from any.\\" (Wentworth Papers, 277) Historians have found little evidence of any organized gang, though in spring 1712 there was a flurry of print accounts of the Mohocks, their lawlessness, impunity and luridly violent acts. In response there was also some derision from satirists at what they perceived to be sensationalism by the Grub Street press. John Gay's first drama, The Mohocks, was written that year but was not performed for political reasons.Calhoun Winton, “The Mohocks”, ch.2 of John Gay and the London Theatre, University of Kentucky 2015, pp.11-25 It was, however, published as a pseudonymous pamphlet.The Mohocks, a tragic-comical farce, London 1712 In 18th century London, Mohawks was subsequently applied to other upper-class drunken rowdies and bravos.

This algorithm is named after the behavior of a building elevator, where the elevator continues to travel in its current direction (up or down) until empty, stopping only to let individuals off or to pick up new individuals heading in the same direction. From an implementation perspective, the drive maintains a buffer of pending read/write requests, along with the associated cylinder number of the request. (Lower cylinder numbers generally indicate that the cylinder is closer to the spindle, and higher numbers indicate the cylinder is farther away.)  Description  When a new request arrives while the drive is idle, the initial arm/head movement will be in the direction of the cylinder where the data is stored, either in or out. As additional requests arrive, requests are serviced only in the current direction of arm movement until the arm reaches the edge of the disk. When this happens, the direction of the arm reverses, and the requests that were remaining in the opposite direction are serviced, and so on.  Variations  One variation of this method ensures all requests are serviced in only one direction, that is, once the head has arrived at the outer edge of the disk, it returns to the beginning and services the new requests in this one direction only (or vice versa). This is known as the \\"Circular Elevator Algorithm\\" or C-SCAN. Although the time of the return seek is wasted, this results in more equal performance for all head positions, as the expected distance from the head is always half the maximum distance, unlike in the standard elevator algorithm where cylinders in the middle will be serviced as much as twice as often as the innermost or outermost cylinders. Other variations include: *FSCAN *LOOK (and C-LOOK) *N-Step-SCAN  Example  The following is an example of how to calculate average disk seek times for both the SCAN and C-SCAN algorithms. * Example list of pending disk requests (listed by track number): 100, 50, 10, 20, 75. * The starting track number for the examples will be 35. * The list will need to be sorted in ascending order: 10, 20, 50, 75, 100. Both SCAN and C-SCAN behave in the same manner until they reach the last track queued. For the sake of this example let us assume that the SCAN algorithm is currently going from a lower track number to a higher track number (like the C-SCAN is doing). For both methods, one takes the difference in magnitude (i.e. absolute value) between the next track request and the current track. * Seek 1: 50 − 35 = 15 * Seek 2: 75 − 50 = 25 * Seek 3: 100 − 75 = 25 At this point both have reached the highest (end) track request. SCAN will just reverse direction and service the next closest disk request (in this example, 20) and C-SCAN will always go back to track 0 and start going to higher track requests. * Seek 4 (SCAN): 20 − 100 = 80 * Seek 5 (SCAN): 10 − 20 = 10 * Total (SCAN): 155 * Average (SCAN): 155 ÷ 5 = 31 * Seek 4 (C-SCAN): 0 − 100 = 0 head movement as cylinders are treated as a circular list (C-SCAN always goes back to the first track) * Seek 5 (C-SCAN): 10 − 0 = 10 * Seek 6 (C-SCAN): 20 − 10 = 10 * Total (C-SCAN): 85 * Average (C-SCAN): 85 ÷ 5 = 17 Even though six seeks were performed using the C-SCAN algorithm, only five I/Os were actually done.  Analysis  The arm movement is thus always less than twice the number of total cylinders then, for both versions of the elevator algorithm. The variation has the advantage to have a smaller variance in response time. The algorithm is also relatively simple. However, the elevator algorithm is not always better than shortest seek first, which is slightly closer to optimal, but can result in high variance in response time and even in starvation when new requests continually get serviced prior to existing requests. Anti- starvation techniques can be applied to the shortest seek time first algorithm to guarantee an optimum response time.

She remarried Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, who became consul in 77 BC, a year after the death of Sulla. Violent upheavals soon ensued out of the ongoing rivalry between Sulla and his former mentor the ageing Gaius Marius. In 86 BC, while Sulla was in Asia Minor pursuing his war against King Mithridates VI of Pontus, he was stripped of his imperium by Marius and his colleagues, and forced into exile. Cornelia and her new husband took rapid steps to safeguard Sulla's estates from the resulting mock trials and proscriptions during Marius's seventh consulship. She then joined her father in exile.

In July 1946, the interim People's Committee of North Korea decided to establish a University (ordinance No. 40). Kim Il-sung proclaimed on 1 October 1946 the founding. In 1948, four university faculties (Faculty of Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Medicine) were separated from Kim Il-sung University, to form the origin of Pyongyang University of Technology (currently Kim Chaek Industrial University), Sariwon Agricultural University and Pyongyang University School of Medicine. Buildings at the Paeksong Revolutionary Site near Pyongsong, to which many students from Kim Il-sung University were moved during the Korean War, for reasons of safety. During the Korean War, the university was located at Baeksong-ri under Mount Jamo in Suncheon-gun, which was far from the centre of the city. By late 1955, the reconstruction of the main building on the Pyongyang campus was in progress and soon the university moved back to the centre of Pyongyang. After the war, Kim Il-Sung University became known as a hotbed of intellectual dissent. Academics supported more intellectual freedoms than Kim loyalists, and disadvantageous factions within the Workers' Party of Korea were over- represented in university staff. Following the Revolutions of 1956 in Hungary and in Poland, North Korean exchange students were quickly repatriated from the affected countries. The students started asking \\"improper\\" questions on campus, causing alarm. After that, up to one hundred students and several prominent staff members were purged. The purging of the university gave further impetus to purges against functionalists all over the country. By the end of 1970s more than 50,000 students graduated annually from the university. In addition, the university was an important asset of for the Korean People's Army to train its personnel. Since the 1970s, English courses have been taught at the university. Until 2004, Pak Kwan-o, an authority on nuclear physics and current Chairman of the People's Committee of Pyongyang (de facto Mayor), had been serving as the president for 17 years.[“北 평양시장 경질...전 김일성대 총장 박관오씨 새로 임명 [North, Replaced the Mayor of Pyongyang...

It is one of three isomeric benzenediols, the 1,3-isomer (or meta-isomer). It is a white, water-soluble solid. Production Resorcinol is produced in several steps from benzene, starting with dialkylation with propylene to give 1,3-diisopropylbenzene. Oxidation and Hock rearrangement of this disubstituted arene gives acetone and resorcinol. Resorcinol is an expensive chemical, produced in only a very few locations around the world (to date only three commercial plants are known to be operative: in the United States, West Germany, and Japan), and as such it is the determining factor in the cost of Phenol Resorcinol Formaldehyde PRF adhesives.Wood adhesives, Pizzi & Mittal, 2010 Many additional routes exist for resorcinol. It can be produced when any of a large number of resins (e.g., galbanum, asafoetida, etc.) are melted with potassium hydroxide, or by the distillation of Brazilwood extract. It may be prepared synthetically by melting 3-iodophenol, phenol-3-sulfonic acid, or benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid with potassium carbonate; by the action of nitrous acid on 3-aminophenol or on 1,3-diaminobenzene. Many ortho- and para-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the bromophenols, benzene-para-disulfonic acid) also yield resorcinol on fusion with potassium hydroxide. Properties Resorcinol crystallizes from benzene as colorless needles that are readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. Reactions It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, as does the isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcinol. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160 °C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid When fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, in the presence of dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145 °C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200 °C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine.A. Seyewitz, Bull. Soc. Chins., 1890, 3, p. 811 With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin [(HO)C6H3(O)]2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid.J. T. Hewitt and F. G. Pope, Jour. C/tern. Soc., 1897, 75, p. 1084 In alcoholic solution it condenses with sodium acetoacetate to form 4-methylumbelliferone. In addition to electrophilic aromatic addition, resorcinol (and other poly-ols) undergo nucleophilic substitution via the enone tautomer. Nitration with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of cold concentrated sulfuric acid yields trinitro-resorcin (styphnic acid), an explosive.  Occurrence  Resorcinol per se does not appear to occur naturally in the free state. It is found in argan oil. Parts of a molecule of catechin, another natural compound that is present in tea, has the resorcinol skeleton structure in it. Alkylresorcinols are a marker of whole grain diet. Applications Resorcinol is mainly used in the production of resins. As a mixture with phenol, it condenses with formaldehyde to afford adhesives. =Medical= It is present in over-the- counter topical acne treatments at 2% or less concentration, and in prescription treatments at higher concentrations. Monoacetylresorcinol, C6H4(OH)(O-COCH3), is used under the name of euresol.Euresol, PubChem It is used in hidradenitis suppurativa with limited evidence showing it can help with resolution of the lesions. Resorcinol is one of the active ingredients in products such as Resinol, Vagisil, and Clearasil. 4-Hexylresorcinol is an anesthetic found in throat lozenges. =Chemical= Resorcinol is also used as a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. It is used in the production of diazo dyes and plasticizers and as a UV absorber in resins. Resorcinol is an analytical reagent for the qualitative determination of ketoses (Seliwanoff's test). Resorcinol is the starting material for resorcinarene molecules and the initiating explosive lead styphnate.\\"Military Explosives,\\" Department of the Army Technical Manual, TM-9-1300-214 (Washington, D.C.: Department of the Army, September 1984), p. 7-12. Resorcinol reacts with formaldehyde to form a thermoset resin which can form the basis of an aerogel. Related compounds Resazurin, C12H7NO4, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on resorcinol, forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and warmed to 210 °C, the solution on pouring into water yields a precipitate of resorufin, C12H7NO3, an oxyphenoxazone, which is insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis. The alkaline solutions are of a rose-red color and show a cinnabar-red fluorescence. A tetrabromresorufin is used as a dye- stuff under the name of Fluorescent Resorcin Blue. Thioresorcinol is obtained by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid on the chloride of benzene meta- disulfonic acid. It melts at 27 °C and boils at 243 °C. Resorcinol disulfonic acid, (HO)2C6H2(HSO3)2, is a deliquescent mass obtained by the action of sulfuric acid on resorcin. It is readily soluble in water and ethanol. Resorcinol is also a common scaffold that is found in a class of anticancer agents, some of which (luminespib, ganetespib, KW-2478, and onalespib) were in clinical trials as of 2014. Part of the resorcinol structure binds to inhibits the N-terminal domain of heat shock protein 90, which is a drug target for anticancer treatments.  History, etymology, and nomenclature  Austrian chemist Heinrich Hlasiwetz (1825–1875) is remembered for his chemical analysis of resorcinol and for his part in the first preparation of resorcinol, along with Ludwig Barth, which was published in 1864.Raj B. Durairaj. Resorcinol: Chemistry, Technology and Applications. Springer Science & Business Media, 2005 Benzene-1,3-diol is the name recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in its 1993 Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry. Resorcinol is so named because of its derivation from ammoniated resin gum, and for its relation to the chemical orcin.H. Hlasiwetz and L. Barth (1864) \\"Ueber einen neuen, dem Orcin homologen Körper\\" (On a new substance homologous to orcin), Annalen der Chemie, 130 (3) : 354-359. Resorcinol is named on p. 358: \\"Wir nennen den neuen Körper, da wir gefunden haben, dass er auch aus dem Ammoniakgummiharz erhalten werden kann, Resorcin, um an seine Entstehung aus Harzen und seine Beziehung zum Orcin zu erinnern.\\" (We name the new substance, since we've found that it can be obtained from ammoniated resin gum, resorcin, in order to recall its creation from resin and its relation to orcin [i.e., orcinol].)

It is an extension of Napier's Bones, using two sets of rods to achieve multi-digit multiplication without the need to write down intermediate results, although some mental addition is still needed to calculate the result. The rods for the multiplicand are similar to Napier's Bones, with repetitions of the values. The set of rods for the multiplier are shutters or masks for each digit placed over the multiplicand rods. The results are then tallied from the digits showing as with other lattice multiplication methods. The final form described by Napier took advantage of symmetries to compact the rods, and used the materials of the day to hold system of metal plates, placed inside a wooden frame.. Design of the Promptuary The promptuary consists of four parts: * a set of number strips, engraved with a large digit at one end and with many small digits along the strip * a set of mask strips, which Napier called 'excised or perforated' strips. Each has a single digit engraved at one end and various triangular holes cut in it * a board on which to place the strips when performing a calculation * a box to store the strips. In Napier's design, the top of the box was the board on which the calculations were performed. The dimensions of the strips depends on the maximum number of digits in the numbers to be multiplied. For a device capable of multiplying two N-digit numbers together, the strips should be (N+1) times as long as they are wide, and there should be 10N number strips and 10N mask strips. So for example, for a promptuary capable of multiplying two five-digit numbers together, the strips should 6 times as long as they are wide, with 50 number strips and 50 mask strips. Napier's example specified strips 1 finger (19mm) wide and 11 fingers (209mm) long, enabling the device to multiply two 10-digits numbers to produce a 20-digit result. Napier specified that the number strips should be a different thickness from the mask strips - one quarter of a finger (5mm) versus one eight of a finger (2.5mm). This is not necessary for the operation of the device. The promptuary contains a lot more pieces than a set of Napier's Bones. A set of Napier's Bones with 20 rods is capable of multiplying numbers of up to 8 digits. An equivalent promptuary needs 160 strips. In the examples and illustrations below, N is set to 5 - that is, the illustrated promptuary can multiply numbers of up to 5 digits. =Number Strips= The number strips are divided into five squares, with about half a square free at each end. A large digit, known as the 'simple', is marked in the space at the top of the strip. A multiplication table is placed in each of the five squares. Each of these multiplication tables is identical - it lists the multiples of the simple and is laid out in a particular way: The square is divided into nine smaller squares in a 3× 3 arrangement. Each of these is divided into two triangles by a diagonal line running from lower left to upper right. The multiples of the digit at the top of the strip, the 'simple', are marked in the table as in the diagram. Napier's Promptuary: Placing multiples on promptuary grid * The simple itself is marked in the triangle labelled × 1. * The number that is two times the simple is marked in the two triangles marked × 2. If the number is two digits, the first digit is placed to the left of the main diagonal (marked in red) and the second digit to the right of the diagonal. If the number is a single digit, it is marked to the right of the diagonal * The number that is 3 times the simple is written in the triangles marked × 3 in the same way as the multiple of 2 * The other multiplies of the simple are marked in the other triangles in the same way. * Zeroes may be written in or left blank. This does not affect the operation of the device. * The triangle in the bottom left of the table is always blank. The following diagram shows the multiplication table for the simple 7: Napier's Promptuary: multiple diagram for digit 7 Complete number strips for the simple 7 and the simple 2 are shown in the following diagram. The lines delineating the triangles have been omitted. Napier's Promptuary: two number strips from the promptuary, for digits 7 and 2 =The Mask Strips= Mask strips are placed horizontally across the calculating board, that is, from left to right rather than from top to bottom. They have a large digit written in the space at one end and the rest of the strip contains five squares. Each square has triangular holes cut in it according to the patterns given in the following diagram. Napier's Promptuary: the mask patterns for digits 0 to 9 So for example the mask strips for the simples 3, 6 and 9 will look as follows: Napier's Promptuary: Three mask strips, for digits 3, 6 and 9 The guide lines in the patterns are for positioning the holes. They do not need to appear on the strips. The main diagonal line of each mask pattern, however, shown here is red, is marked on the mask strip. It is an important part of the device. The pattern given here for the simple 0 is from later editions of Napier's book. The version of the 0 strip in the first edition had no holes in it. Performing a Multiplication Number strips for the first of the numbers to be multiplied, the 'multiplicand', are placed on the calculating board side by side, running from top to bottom of the board. In the example shown here, the muliplicand is 772. Mask strips for the second number, the 'multiplier', are placed horizontally on top of the number strips. In the example, the multiplier it 396. Napier's Promptuary: calculating 772 times 396 The result of the multiplication is read from the device by examining the digits visible through the triangular holes in the mask strips. Those parts of the number strips that are not covered by the mask strips are ignored. The diagonal lines on the mask strips divide the device into diagonal bands containing digits visible through the holes. * Starting at the right, the first band with any visible digits contains just one digit, a 2. This is written down as the right-most digit of the result. * The next band from the right has three digits, 2, 1 and 8. These are added together to get 11. The 'units' digit of this addition, 1, is written down as the next digit of the multiplication result. The 'tens' digit, which is 1, is carried into the next band. * The third band from the right has five digits, 2, 4, 3, 1 and 6 plus the carried 1. These are all added to produce 17. The units digit of this, 7, is written as the next digit of the result. The tens digit, 1, is carried into the next band. * This process is repeated for each diagonal band from right to left until all the digits have been processed. The full result has now been written down as 305712. This is the result of multiplying 772 by 396. The multiplication process required only addition, and no intermediate results needed to be written down. An Example of the Promptuary in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain The Promptuary and the Napier's Bones at the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. An example of the Promptuary is in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. It also includes an example of Napier's bones. The apparatus is a box of wood with inlays of bone. In the top section it contains the \\"bones\\" calculation device, and in the bottom section is the promptuary. This example consists of 300 stored cards in 30 drawers. One hundred of these cards are covered with numbers (referred to as the \\"number cards\\"). The remaining two hundred cards contain small triangular holes, which, when laid on top of the number cards, allow the user to see only certain numbers. By the capable positioning of these cards, multiplications can be made up to the limit of a number 10 digits in length, by another number 20 digits in length. In addition, the doors of the box contain the first powers of the digits, the coefficients of the terms of the first powers of the binomial and the numeric data of the regular polyhedra.Diccionario enciclopédico hispano-americano de literatura, ciencias y artes, Mountainer y Simón Editores, Barcelona, 1887, Tomo I, pp. 19–20. It is not known who was the maker of this piece, nor if it is of Spanish origin or came from a foreigner, although it is probable that it originally belonged to the Spanish Academy of Mathematics (which was created by Philip II) or was a gift from the Prince of Wales. The only thing that is sure is that it was conserved in the Palace, whence it was passed to the National library and later to the National Archaeological Museum, where it is still conserved. In 1876, the Spanish government sent the apparatus to the exhibition of scientific instruments in Kensington, where it received so much attention that several societies consulted the Spanish representation about the origin and use of the apparatus.
