Description The first M-48B-1 models may have been Czech M28 mountain guns (bought by Yugoslavia in 1930s) relined from original 75mm calibre to Soviet 76mm (as used on their 76mm regimental and divisional guns), with muzzle-brake added to cope with increased recoil (also Skoda type, borrowed from M.36 AA model). There have been at least five variants of the M48: * The M-48 (B-1) has pneumatic tyres and a maximum towing speed of 60 km/h. It can also be towed by animals in tandem or disassembled into eight pack loads. * The M-48 (B-1A1-I) has the pneumatic tyres and wheels as fitted to the M48 (B-1), plus some of the features of the suspension of the M48 (B-1A2). * The M-48 (B-1A2) can also be used as a field piece but cannot be towed by animals or disassembled for pack transport. * The M-48 (B-1A2) has light alloy wheels with solid rubber tyres and modified suspension, its maximum towing speed is 30 km/h. * The final production model of the 76 mm mountain gun M48 was called the B-2 about which little is known.

Its administrative center was Belgrade. History The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed in 1918 and was initially divided into counties and districts (this division was inherited from previous state administrations). In 1922, new administrative units known as oblasts (Serbo-Croatian: oblasti / –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏) were introduced and the whole country was divided into 33 oblasts. Before 1922, territory of Belgrade Oblast was part of the Belgrade, Novi Sad, and Veliki Beƒçkerek districts. In 1924, as the result of an adjustment of the border between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Romania, the town of ≈Ωombolj (Jimbolia) was transferred to Romania. In 1929, 33 oblasts were administratively replaced with 9 banovinas and one district, and territory of Belgrade Oblast was administratively divided between the Belgrade City Administration and the Danube Banovina. Geography The Belgrade Oblast included small northern part of ≈†umadija near Belgrade, western parts of Banat and eastern parts of Baƒçka. It shared borders with the Baƒçka Oblast and Syrmia Oblast in the west, the Valjevo Oblast in the south-west, the Podunavlje Oblast in the south-east, Romania in the north-east and Hungary in the north.

As of 2018, he was International President of the Dignity Freedom Network (DFN) (previously known as Dalit Freedom Network), President of the All India Christian Council (AICC), and CEO of the Indian arm of the missionary group Operation Mobilisation. On 30 August 2014, he was consecrated as Archbishop of the Good Shepherd Church of India, and associated ministries. Early life and education Joseph D'souza was born into an upper caste Christian family, living in what he calls \\"Christian ghettos\\" surrounded by low caste and Dalit people. He holds a B.S. in Chemistry from Karnataka University, a M.A. in Communications from the Asian Theological Seminary in the Philippines, and an honorary Doctor in Divinity degree from the Gospel for Asia Biblical Seminary, an affiliate of Serampore University. He married Mariam, who came from an Adivasi tribal group, despite the opposition of some of his family and friends. D'souza's daughter Beryl is the medical and anti- human trafficking director of the Dignity Freedom Network. Career One of the factors in D'souza's decision to take up the cause of Christians and Dalits was the start of attacks on Christians in the mid-1990s, including the burning to death of the missionary Graham Staines and his two young sons in Orissa in 1999. D'souza joined the Indian branch of George Verwer's evangelist Operation Mobilisation as an international vice president, and was later promoted to CEO as of 2012. He has set up 107 English Medium Education Centers educating nearly 25,000 Dalit children working with Operation Mercy India Foundation. In 1998, he founded the All India Christian Council (AICC). The AICC is one of the largest interdenominational Christian alliances, formed to deal with human rights issues and national concerns common to Christians in India. In 2002, D'souza co-founded the Dignity Freedom Network (DFN), formerly known as the Dalit Freedom Network, first in the United States and, later, expanded to other countries. D'souza travels widely in campaigning for the fundamental rights of the poor, the marginalized and outcastes of society in South Asia and other nations of the world. D'souza has discussed human rights issues with civil society leaders and politicians in India, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and the United States, and at human rights commission meetings. Dalit advocacy Speaking in October 2005 before a US Congressional hearing, D'souza said that \\"India's tragedy is that society continues the practice of the caste system, with the rule of law not being applied when Dalits are being discriminated against, even though the practice of untouchability stands abolished by the Constitution.\\" He also noted that \\"Christian Dalits continue to suffer for their allegiance to the Christian faith. They are discriminated against both within the Church and outside of the Church. Their rights are trampled upon. Their very existence is one of misery and suffering\\". Talking of a mass conversion ceremony in October 2006, D'souza was reported by the BBC as saying \\"I think it's important to understand that this is a cry for human dignity, it's a cry for human worth\\". On 4 November 2001 thousands of Dalits left Hinduism en masse. Most chose to become Buddhist, but D'souza sees this as a stage towards accepting Christianity. D'souza has given many examples of cases where Dalits have been attacked when they resisted oppression. He has written that \\"Efforts by Dalits such as Surekha Bhotmange to demand their rights have provoked a brutal backlash from higher caste groups. In fact, incidents such as these, where witnesses, or those that seek judicial remedy, are brutally savaged, have become depressingly common\\". Christian advocacy As chair of the All India Christian Council, D'souza has asked Christian leaders to stop publishing incendiary rhetoric, which was being used as fuel for anti-Christian propaganda. He asked them to refrain from \\"bombastic slogans, militant language and a general demeaning of Indian culture\\". Writing in 2002, D'souza said \\"If the Christian Church in India does not abolish caste within the Church and closes its doors to the Dalits because of the pressure of the Brahminical dominated RSS and its fundamentalist affiliates, the Dalits will turn to whoever offers them human dignity, equality and the right to spiritual salvation... The time has come for the Indian Church to clean its own house and to openly offer and give the Dalits their God given dignity as the children of God in Jesus Christ. The time has come for the Dalits to appropriate the full spiritual rights available in Jesus Christ. The time has come to turn away from the Brahminical Social Order and to create a new humanity. The Gospel of Jesus has the solution to the caste problem because the Gospel rejects all forms of discrimination and deals with issues of the heart, soul, body and human relationships\\". D'souza has disputed that Christians are involved in forced, fraudulent and manipulated conversions. He has stated that conversion by force is against the teachings of Jesus. In January 2002, the AICC issued a statement signed by Joseph D'souza as President and John Dayal as Secretary General, asking the national and state governments to prevent efforts by the Sangh Parivar to stir up communal violence in the Adivasi tribal belt in Northern India. It talked of \\"vicious Hindutva communal rhetoric .. targeting Christians in the region\\". It said RSS cadres were running schools that \\"follow a curricula and textual material, which is outside the pale of any academic and public scrutiny, blatantly rewrites history, and poisons young minds\\". Criticism The Hindu American Foundation criticized D'souza's 2005 congressional testimony stating the hearing was \\"deliberately biased and misrepresentative of India and Hinduism\\" with witnesses including D'souza who held \\"virulent Hinduphobic perspectives that lack any credibility in India or abroad.\\" Specifically, the organisation criticized D'souza for terming the conversion of Hindus to Christianity as \\"the process of breaking this spiritual darkness.\\" Bibliography References ;Sources    Category:Indian civil rights activists Category:Living people Category:Indian Christians Category:Dalit activists Category:Karnatak University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Joseph D'souza"},{"id":"35506699","text":"RNA, U4atac small nuclear (U12-dependent splicing) is a small nuclear RNA that in humans is encoded by the RNU4ATAC gene.

The park was a major feature of Alan Bond's Yanchep Sun City plan. It closed in August 1990 due to financial difficulty.  History  In the 1970s Bond purchased 20,000 acres of land in Yanchep with a plan to build a large resort and residential area. The Park was constructed in 1981 with the hope that Perth's rapid expansion would be accompanied by an equal growth in tourism. Six months before the park was opened, seven bottlenose dolphins were caught locally and trained as performance animals for the next ten years. The park was opened by the Premier of Western Australia the Hon. Ray O'Connor and the chairman and president of the Tokyu Corporation Mr Noburu Gotoh. In his opening speech Mr Gotoh explained that Atlantis was the first element in an expansion plan to make the Yanchep Sun City a premier leisure recreation region. In 1988, three female dolphin calves were born, which as a result of changes in regulations for holding marine mammals meant Atlantis would have to construct a larger dolphin enclosure. This, coupled with the park gradually losing money, was the reason for the owners closing Atlantis in August 1990.  Dolphins  Prior to the park's opening, seven bottlenose dolphins were caught from the local coastal population and were used as performance animals for the next ten years. At the time Atlantis closed in 1990, the park had nine dolphins, six wild born, and three captive born juveniles. With the closure of the park, the owners Tokyu Corporation of Japan, ..Yanchep .Sun City Ptv Lt...would take over...the development of 19,186 acres of resort and residential area near Perth, Tokyu Corporation announced to day... agreed to a proposal by Dr. Nick Gales, a marine park veterinarian and research scientist to fully fund the release of the animals to the wild, provided it would end their financial commitment to the dolphins. The project to release the animals into the wild began in March 1991; the rehabilitation program began in the park pools and eventually moved to a sea pen at the Two Rocks Marina in October 1991. The dolphins were fully released into the wild in January 1992. The initial release encountered problems, with some of the dolphins losing a lot of weight. Three of them were recaptured and returned to the sea pen. The three recaptured dolphins were not re-released to the wild, but were relocated to Underwater World, now the Aquarium of Western Australia.  Current situation  King Neptune in 2012. Since its closure in 1990 the park has been abandoned and vandalised, though the site was featured in the CBBC programme All Over the Place ‚Äì Australia in March 2014. The site is currently owned by property developers, the Fini Group. A plan has been put forward to the City of Wanneroo to develop the area into a mix of retail, commercial and entertainment land uses. In the plan, key features of the Marine Park such as King Neptune would be retained. After a several months long restoration, the King Neptune sculpture and surrounding area was reopened to the public in May 2015. The sculpture was previously heritage listed by the Western Australian Heritage Council in 2006.

It is the main band that plays for the school's Annual Parades and other school functions. In the early years of the SJIMB, it was the first school military band that played for the National Day Parade in the 1960s, which then started the series of school bands being involved in the National Day Parades of Singapore. The SJIMB was one of the earliest bands founded in Singapore.  History  The SJIMB was founded in 1957 under the blessings of the then Brother Director of SJI, Brother Lawrence Robless and the first Drum Major of the band was Adrian Villaneuva. It only consisted of a Bugle and Fife Band then. In 1963, the band began to receive its Brass and Woodwind components, making the band become a full military band. Recently, as early as 2010, the band has started to change from being a full-time military band into becoming more focused on its concert aspect. It continues to do marching performances during the school's parades, but on other times, it does concert music and participates in the Singapore Youth Festival.  Achievements  Most of the band's competitions are just the biannually-held Singapore Youth Festival. In 2009's Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging, the band clinched the Gold With Honours award under the baton of Mr Tan Thiam Hee. It is the highest achievable award in that competition and was one of the top 10 bands in the competition to do so. However, in the 2011 Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging, the band managed to clinch the Silver award. The choice piece was \\"The Seventh Night of July\\" and the set piece was \\"Memories of Friendship\\".

There is also a student conductor (Concert Master) appointed by the teachers-in-charge from the leading batch of that year. Mr Tan Thiam Hee was the music director until December 2011, Mr Darence Leng was the music director until June 2019 and the current music director is Mdm Tan Soh Hwa.  Concerts  Every two years, the Band organises a concert for the public to watch. The concerts are generally called Renaissance, and the most recent concert, Renaissance XXI was held on 26 May 2018 at CJC (The 2020 concert was cancelled due to COVID-19). The Band only started to have Renaissance concerts in the late 1990s. The Band also holds some smaller concerts, especially during overseas exchanges.

His father Michael Filalo Chisembele and uncle Romano Filalo Lupambo had come from Mporokoso via Kawambwa to Fort Rosebery in 1915 and started lay-preaching under the direction of visiting priests attached to the Lubwe Mission. Michael Filalo Chisembele was later sent to Rosa Catechist School where he was formally trained as a lay-preacher and teacher. On his return to Fort Rosebery, they encountered great difficulties with the District Commissioner which were resolved after the intervention of the Lubwe Mission priests and the Bishop at Chilubula, in order for them to start to build the first Roman Catholic churches and schools. Michael Filalo Chisembele and his brother Romano established the first Roman Catholic church in Fort Rosebery in 1920.\\"Letter from Bishop Emeritus of Mansa, Ren√©-Georges Pailloux, M.Afr. (White Fathers) (1902‚Äì1988)\\" date: 20 May 1973 They also encountered initial problems with the Chiefs which were overcome. Schools were built with mud, sand and wood for the roofs by the people converted to Catholicism in the surrounding areas.\\"Diary Michael Filalo Chisembele\\" date: circa 1917‚Äì1949 This was the strong religious background to Sylvester's early life. In 1948 he was asked to leave the Seminary due to disagreements on racial equality, his views were considered too radical for that period in time. Business As a trader of finger millet he made enough money to invest in a restaurant and a bakery. He had also introduced Mikwau Fishing Nets on Lake Bangweulu. Activism He joined the African National Congress. By 1955, Mr Chisembele had organised a firm ANC base in Fort Rosebery (Mansa) using his own resources. At Lubwe Mission with the full participation of Mr Sylvester Muchengwa and Mr Protasio Kamayanda, both leading personalities and leaders in the Catholic Church, the ANC spread rapidly. In 1956 Mr Chisembele along with three of his colleagues, were all sent to prison in Fort Rosebery and Ndola's Bwana Mkubwa prison for 9 months with hard labour. Chisembele ‚Äì Visiting Chiefs on Campaign. Upon their return, Mr Chisembele continued organising the ANC and was elected Provincial General Secretary of Luapula Province in 1957. In May 1958 there was an assassination attempt on his life. His life was saved by villagers who ran to his rescue, but the incident left him with a shattered eardrum and impaired hearing for the rest of his life In 1958 Mr Chisembele was called to Lusaka to accompany Mr Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula, leader of African National Congress, on a tour of Luapula Province. The tour was not a success. When there was a split in October 1958, Chisembele formed the Zambia African National Congress (ZANC) party. UNIP was built on the ashes of the ZANC, which the British colonial governor banned. On 12 March 1959 Mr Chisembele was arrested and detained at Kalabo, in the Barotse Province, now Western Province, for 9 months under the restriction order of Governor Sir Arthur Benson. In July 1961, Mr Chisembele successfully organised the burning of the colonial identity cards commonly known as \\"Chitupas\\" throughout Luapula Province. Mr Chisembele was imprisoned for three months with hard labour in Milima prison in Kasama District. Between 1956 and 1962 Mr Chisembele was many times imprisoned ranging from one month to three months for addressing meetings without a permit and on some occasions for addressing indoor meetings without a permit, although these meetings were of Party members and did not, by law, require any permit. Government  After independence, Mr Chisembele served in many portfolios in government in different ministries and at Cabinet Minister level in various provinces. In 1968 general elections, the ruling party UNIP lost all seats in Barotse Province to opposition ANC. In 1969 Mr Chisembele was transferred from Copperbelt to the Barotse Province as Cabinet Minister. He established an excellent working relationship with the Litunga, Mbikushita Lewanika and enjoyed the support of his KUTA and the Ngambela SUU. By 1970 he not only won back the province to UNIP but also had all the MPs cross the floor to UNIP, a feat that drew him congratulations from all his colleagues including telegrams of congratulations from Hon. Sikota Wina amongst others. Apart from the Copperbelt and Western Province, he served as Cabinet Minister in Eastern Province. Constitution process The Constitution for Zambia implemented at the start of Independence was drawn up by the outgoing colonial power, Britain. This Constitution agreed to by the President in waiting, Kenneth David Kaunda, gave him sole power over the affairs of the Nation. No opportunity was given to the Provincial leaders or the UNIP National Council to discuss or debate the merits or failures in this imposed Constitution. As a result, the Constitution was a bone of dissension from the beginning. Luapula Province in particular was opposed to a system of one-man rule as earlier events at the Magoye Conference in 1962 had shown.\\"Zambia, National Assembly Daily Parliamentary Debates, First Session of the Seventh National Assembly 4.12.91, column 109, Although a Referendum was held in 1969 to amend the Zambia Constitution, this did not touch on the powers held by President Kaunda, the purpose was to amend the Referendum clause to allow proposed amendments to be considered by elected representatives rather than the country at large. The hope that consideration of the Constitution clause touching on Presidential powers would be given was not part of the process. It took years before the effects of the one-man rule system became apparent to a sufficiently large enough faction to bring about attempts to amend the Constitution clause that gave all power to one individual. Chisembele made submissions on the necessity of reducing presidential powers to all the subsequent Constitution Review Commissions but these were either ignored or unheeded. Retirement from politics Mr Chisembele retired from active politics in 1983 and concentrated on running his private businesses. History repeated itself, from 1993 to 1997 both his restaurants were expropriated and his farm destroyed and repossessed by government. In October 2004 it was published in the press and stated in Gazette Notice No. 640 dated 22 October 2004, that he had been awarded the Order of the Eagle of Zambia 4th Division, this was a lie. Mr Chisembele had refused to accept the Award. Death Mr Chisembele started suffering ill health in October 2005 and his condition had not been fully diagnosed, despite undergoing several tests up to the time of his death, on 5 February 2006. Mr Chisembele was survived by his wife, Sophena, together for 38 years, and three daughters, Bwalya Matilda, Mary Chewe and Christina Chishimba. His wife, Sophena, wrote a book published in 2016 recounting the freedom struggle and the aftermath with particular reference to the history of Sylvester Chisembele  References  * ZAMBIA ‚Äì 'The Freedom Struggle and the Aftermath' by Sophena Chisembele, Category:1930 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Zambian businesspeople Category:United National Independence Party politicians Category:Members of the National Assembly (Zambia) Category:People from Mansa District, Zambia Category:20th-century businesspeople ","title":"Sylvester Chisembele"},{"id":"35506961","text":"Evropa (English: Europe) is the fourth studio album by Bosnian Serb singer Stoja.

Emperor Stephen Du≈°an asked Buƒáa for advice in every major question, as he was his most reliable advisor, and Buƒáa remained in the service of the Emperor until his death.Blagojeviƒá-Medakoviƒá-Lju≈°iƒá-Popov 2000, p. 221: \\"–ü—Ä–≤–∏ –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—ò–∞—Ä —Ü–∞—Ä–∞ –î—É—à–∞–Ω–∞, –∫–æ—ò–∏ —ò–µ –∏—Å–ø—É—ö–∞–≤–∞–æ —Å–≤–µ –Ω–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–µ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ, –±–∏–æ —ò–µ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –ø–ª–µ–º–∏—õ –∏ —Ç—Ä–≥–æ–≤–∞—Ü –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ë—É—õ–∞. –£–∂–∏–≤–∞–æ —ò–µ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ–≤–æ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ—ö–µ –∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–æ —ò–µ —É —ö–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ—ò —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∏ —Å–≤–µ –¥–æ —Å–≤–æ—ò–µ —Å–º—Ä—Ç–∏.\\" Life Nikola was part of the Buƒáa noble family of Kotor, in the Serbian Kingdom (modern Montenegro). The first known Buƒáa was Tripe Mihov (Trifun Buƒáa, –¢—Ä–∏—Ñ—É–Ω –ë—É—õ–∞). Kotoran families held high offices in the Serbian court, and the most notable was the Buƒça family, while the most notable individual was Nikola Buƒáa.Kostiƒá 2001, Uvodni tekstovi, Nemanjiƒái i Boka His brother was Mihajlo Buƒáa, also a diplomat of Stephen Du≈°an, and his nephew was Trifun Mihajlov Buƒáa.Vizantolo≈°ki institut 2004, pp. 389-390 Nikola and Toma Pavlov, another notable Kotoran, traded in salt.Vizantolo≈°ki institut 2004, pp. 459 Nikola Buƒáa along with Metropolitan of Prizren Arsenije, kaznac Baldovin, vojvoda Gradislav, ≈æupan Vratko, knez Grgur Kurjakoviƒá, stavilac Milo≈° (title mentioned for the first time), vojvoda Dejan Manjak, Gradislav Su≈°enica, and more, signed the letter issued by Stephen Uro≈° III, dated 22 January 1325, for the sale of some maritime possessions to the Republic of Ragusa.Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti 1908, p. 252Istorijski institut u Beogradu, SANU 1976, p. 21 The possessions were Ston and Pelje≈°ac, which the Ragusans earlier had tried to buy through talks with Tripe Mihov. On 15 July 1326, King Stephen Uro≈° III confirmed that Andrija Pe≈°tiƒá, Nikola Buƒáa and Grubeta had paid their bills for some royal markets which they had leased.Univerzitet u Beogradu 1971, p. 209: \\"–°—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–Ω –î–µ—á–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —ò–µ –Ω–ø—Ä. –ø–æ—Ç–≤—Ä–¥–∏–æ 15. —ò—É–ª–∞ 1326. –¥–∞ —Å—É –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –ü–µ—à—Ç–∏—õ, –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ë—É—á–∏—õ –∏ –ì—Ä—É–±–µ—Ç–∞ –∏–∑—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∞–ª–∏ —Ä–∞—á—É–Ω–µ –∑–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–µ —Ç—Ä–≥–æ–≤–µ –∫–æ—ò–µ —Å—É –¥—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ —É –∑–∞–∫—É–ø.\\" Buƒáa had paid several people to gain control of business in Kotor; On 1 December 1326, he entrusted Ilija, the nephew of Bratoslav Dusinj of Ragusa, with 700 perpers, and then he personally invested in goods of Kotor which he sold in Serbia. In January 1336, Nikola and his brother Mihajlo became Ragusan citizens, and received the notable right of counselor (veƒánik). Their sons also received Ragusan citizenship. The granting of citizenship was a result of Buƒáa's involvement in the sale.Orbini-Bari≈°iƒá-Samard≈æiƒá 1968, p. 34 The most notable nobles of King Stephen Du≈°an (the velika≈°i, \\"great ones\\") received up to 1000 ducats, and Nikola Buƒáa was given a plot of land in Ragusa itself, and a part of Ston.ƒÜoroviƒá 1999, p. 253: \\"–î–∞ —Å–µ —Ç–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≥–Ω–µ –∏–º–∞–ª–∏ —Å—É –¥–æ–±–∏—Ç–∏ –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–∏ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—à–∏ –¥–æ 1000 –¥—É–∫–∞—Ç–∞, –∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ë—É—õ–∞ –∑–µ–º—ô–∏—à—Ç–µ —É —Å–∞–º–æ–º –î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫—É –∏ —ò–µ–¥–∞–Ω –¥–µ–æ —É –°—Ç–æ–Ω—É.\\" The city of Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) had highly enriched itself during the rule of Emperor Stephen Du≈°an, who had constantly granted it gifts and delegations. There are sources saying that the Kotoran nobles received fame during the reign of King Stephen Uro≈° III, when they, under the command of Nikola Buƒáa, captured the Bulgarian flag and cross during the Battle of Velbu≈æd (1330). He probably had supported Du≈°an's overthrow of his father, King Uro≈° III, in 1331. In 1344, he asked permission to build the Dominican Monastery of St. Nicholas in Kotor. Buƒáa held the title komornik (In latin documents \\"comes camerarius\\"), prior to the crowning of Stephen Du≈°an as Emperor, at which time the Serbian nobility and clergy were elevated in titles - Buƒáa was elevated to protovestijar. The protovestijar was the chief financial official. Buƒáa had a number of associates and business partners in his near relatives.Srejoviƒá-Gavriloviƒá-ƒÜirkoviƒá 1892, p. 536: \\"–ó–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ —Ü–∞—Ä–∞ –î—É—à–∞–Ω–∞, –∏—Å—Ç–∞–∫–Ω—É—Ç—É —É–ª–æ–≥—É —É –≤–æ—õ–µ—ö—É –¥—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ö —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–∏—ò–∞ –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ –∏–º–∞–æ —ò–µ —ö–µ–≥–æ–≤ –¥—É–≥–æ–≥–æ–¥–∏—à—ö–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—ò–∞—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –ë—É—õ–∞, —É–≥–ª–µ–¥–∞–Ω –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–µ–ª–∏–Ω –∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å–∞–Ω –ø–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–Ω —á–æ–≤–µ–∫. –û–Ω —ò–µ –∏–º–∞–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ –ø–æ–º–æ—õ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ —Å–∞—Ä–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∫–æ—ò–∏ —Å—É...\\" The power of the protovestijar is best testified by the proverb: \\"Car da ‚Äì al Buƒáa ne da\\" (The Emperor gives, but Buƒáa does not). Buƒáa accompanied Emperor Du≈°an on his visits to Dubrovnik and Kotor, in 1350. He died in 1354. His nephew Trifun Mihajlov Buƒáa (fl. 1357), one of the most known and important persons in his time, served Emperor Du≈°an's successor Uro≈° V as protovestijar.

Description A red and black spider hunting wasp with fairly short and thick antennae with well-developed sensory powers which it uses to identify the nests of other spider wasps and tarsal combs on the forelegs for digging into these nests. Biology In Great Britain and Ireland the flight period is May to September. E. crassicornis is a kleptoparasitic species probably preying on various species of spider wasp, although specific hosts have not been identified. It is thought that in Britain the hosts are Arachnospila anceps and Anoplius nigerrimus, and there is a European record of Arachnospila trivialis being parasitised. E. crassicornis spends a lot of time searching for the nests of its host species on open sunny ground. Once the host's nest has been invaded E. crassicornis eats the hosts's egg and lays its own on the paralysed spider and then reseals the host's nest. Adult E. crassicornis visit a wide variety of open flowers which have short corollae, especially Apiaceae and Asteraceae.

According to the New York Times, he was \\"known for his scientific work, including fundamental contributions to the understanding of autism, Tourette's syndrome and other illnesses, and for his leadership in bringing together the biological and the psychological approaches to understanding psychiatric disorders in childhood\\"; his work \\"reshaped the field of child psychiatry\\". He was also known as an advocate for social policy, and for his work to promote the interests of children exposed to violence and trauma. Personal life and education Donald Jay Cohen was born in Chicago, Illinois on September 5, 1940. His father was a businessman. His family says that when he \\"was five years old he went up to his room to study and never came down\\". According to his son-in-law and later colleague Andr√©s Martin, Cohen was an \\"observant Jew with deep ties to Israel and a lifelong preoccupation with the Holocaust\\", who described himself as a \\"Jewish boy of humble origins growing up in Chicago\\". Cohen graduated summa cum laude from Brandeis University in 1961, with a BA in philosophy and psychology, and studied philosophy at Cambridge University on a Fulbright fellowship. He obtained his MD in 1966 from Yale School of Medicine, and completed his general and child psychiatry residency at Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Children's Hospital, in Boston and Washington, DC. According to The New York Times, Cohen said that \\"as a student he honed his fund-raising skills working as a copy writer for a mail order catalog, extolling the virtues of women's hats and other merchandise\\". He was described as \\"an avid scholar who loved French poetry and German philosophy, as well as science and medicine\\". Cohen died in New Haven, Connecticut of ocular melanoma on October 2, 2001 at the age of 61; he was survived by his wife, Phyllis Cohen, a psychoanalyst at the Yale Child Study Center, four children, and five grandchildren, two brothers, and his mother. Career =Medical= Cohen joined the Yale School of Medicine in 1972. Along with other researchers, he had begun looking at non-psychological (organic) causes for Tourette syndrome (TS) by 1976.Kushner, HI. A Cursing Brain? : The Histories of Tourette Syndrome. Harvard University Press, 2000, p. 182. Cohen was named the director of the Yale Child Study Center in 1983‚Äîa position he held until his death in 2001. In 2000, he was named the Sterling Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Psychology at Yale. At Yale, he studied personality development, TS management, the effects of stress on developing children, and the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in neuropsychiatric disorders. According to a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Cohen \\"moved child psychiatry into the biological era, but he continued to put emphasis on the psychological and social aspects affecting child development\\". According to the Yale Bulletin, Cohen made \\"groundbreaking contributions in biological psychiatry, clinical care and the development of international collaborations in child psychiatry\\". As a \\"pioneer\\" in autism and Tourette syndrome research, he proposed treatments for TS which \\"opened new avenues to treating and understanding the disorder\\". His colleague Andr√©s Martin said his work with autism \\"was in large part devoted to understanding and listening to those same individuals who had been written off as incapable of communicating meaningfully and to following the string of their social communicative mishaps to their deepest core\\". At Yale, Cohen helped found the International Working Group on Children and War, and the Yale-New Haven Child Development Community Policing Program, to train first responders to help children exposed to violence and trauma; police were trained to call in the Yale Child Study Center professionals in instances of violence or trauma involving children. Martin said, \\"he dedicated much of his later career to addressing the mental health needs of children in poor and war-torn nations\\". =Appointments= Cohen became a vice-president of the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP) in 1986, and was president from 1992‚Äì98, where his work fostered \\"international collaborations in research and clinical care\\". According to the Yale Bulletin, he was proud of his work in helping to promote child psychiatry in Gaza and in creating the Eastern Mediterranean Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (EMACAPAP), for which he served as chair of the international scientific committee. He served as vice-president of the board of governors of Yale University Press, was an analyst at the Western New England Institute of Psychoanalysis, and was a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He held additional chair appointments with the Child Health and Development Institute, the International President of the Telefon Azzuro Foundation in Italy, and Schneider Children's Hospital of Israel. He served on editorial boards in the United States as well as in France, Israel, and Great Britain. =Other achievements= Cohen was also known as an \\"institutional builder\\"; he is credited with transforming three buildings at Yale to help give the Yale Child Study Center prominence (the Children's Psychiatric Inpatient Service, the Harris-Provence Child Development Unit, and the Nelson and Irving Harris Building), obtaining \\"prominent and central locations at the medical school for each of these buildings\\". He also helped bring kosher kitchens to the University. Publications Cohen authored or co-authored more than 300 professional articles and 159 book chapters, including \\"the definitive textbooks on pervasive developmental disorders and on tic disorders\\". His books include: * Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Diagnosis, Development, Neurobiology, and Behavior (volume 1), * Tourette's Syndrome -- Tics, Obsessions, Compulsions: Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care, * Tourette's Syndrome and Tic Disorders: Clinical Understanding and Treatment, * Life Is with Others: Selected Writings on Child Psychiatry, * The Yale Child Study Center Guide to Understanding Your Child: Healthy Development from Birth to Adolescence, He inspired the production of the \\"first Israeli textbook of child psychiatry in Hebrew, the first modern textbook of child psychiatry in China and a new textbook of child psychiatry in South Korea\\". Legacy Colleagues said Cohen \\"blended a profound spirituality with a broad understanding of science and clinical work\\"; friend Joe Lieberman described him as someone who \\"did more in his 61 years than most anyone else could ever hope to accomplish in a lifetime ... a true professional, and caregiver and friend to the thousands of people who had the good fortune of knowing him\\" and a person who \\"dedicated his life to helping children and adolescents ... working tirelessly to develop and promote programs to assist children\\". He was described as \\"a humanist, with tremendous compassion and insight into his patients\\". Colleague James F. Leckman said, \\"He fostered the development of the next generation of academic child psychiatrists from many countries, in Europe, Korea, China, as well as Israel\\", and described him as \\"committed to forging closer ties between Israel and Palestine through contacts and visits with various psychiatrists, psychologists, and social service agencies active in Gaza and the West Bank.\\" According to Leckman and colleague Joseph L. Woolston, Cohen's \\"ability to put children and adults at ease\\" was \\"just magical\\"; Leckman said of Cohen, \\"To be a good child psychiatrist, you have to be a child at heart, and Donald was always willing to be sort of down there on the floor with the kids.\\" But he was also known for engaging parents; according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network: > Regardless of the disorder he was studying, Dr. Cohen engaged parents to an > unprecedented degree. He took their advice in designing his studies and > shared his papers with them before submitting them for publication. He > called this approach, \\"participatory research,\\" and the children's families > loved him for it. According to Joe Lieberman: > I recently learned from my colleague, Senator Dodd, that Dr. Cohen was the > first person to suggest a special health insurance program for children that > ultimately became the Children's Health Insurance Program. Today, this > program throughout the Nation provides health care for millions of children > who would otherwise go without the basic care they need to grow up healthy > and flourish. =Recognition= In 2001, The Donald J. Cohen National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative was established \\"to improve access to care, treatment, and services for children and adolescents exposed to traumatic events and to encourage and promote collaboration between service providers in the field.\\" The Stress Initiative was a bill by Senator Joe Lieberman and approved by both houses of US Congress to amend the Public Health Service Act to recognize Cohen's contributions to victims of violence-related stress. In 2002, the Donald J. Cohen and Irving B. Harris Center for Trauma and Disaster Intervention was named at Tel Aviv University to honor Cohen's contributions. Cohen's work was recognized by the National Commission on Children and the American Psychiatric Association (APA); he received the Strecker Award from the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital and the Agnes Purcell McGavin Award for Prevention from the APA. Other programs established in his honor include: * The Donald J. Cohen Fellowship in Developmental Neuroscience at Emory University. * The Donald J.

The region is located on the northern slopes of the volcano Karadaƒü, around north of the province capital city of Karaman. The church ruins are situated in and around the settlements Maden≈üehri, √ú√ßkuyu and Deƒüle. Buildings The region was a cultural center of the Byzantine Christians in the era between the 3rd and 8th century. There are remains of churches, monasteries, cisterns, fortifications and habitations that are integrated in the villages. The stone materials were re-used in the today's buildings that caused continuous diminishing of the historical inventory. From the architecture historical viewpoint, the several domed basilicas of Syriac Orthodox type are interesting. The walls were built of large cut stone blocks. Due to lack of wood in the region, the buildings were topped with stone domed roofs instead of flat wooden roofs. Over the aisles, matronea were constructed behind the upper column row. In apses, there were double clerestory windows. The narthexes have mostly double arcades and are supported by a single column in the center. In some churches, primarily in Maden≈üehri, remains of murals can be seen. Also rare relicts from the Hittites, Roman and Hellenistic period are found in the surroundings. History of research work Gertrude Bell's workers at the excavations at Maden≈üehri in 1907 In 1904, Carl Holzmann (1849‚Äì1914) published his Arch√§ologischen Skizzen () about Binbirkilise. Shortly after, the region was described by British traveller and archaeologist Gertrude Bell (1868‚Äì1926), who explored the region in 1905 during her trip through Asia Minor. She published her observations in a series of articles in the Revue Arch√©ologique. During this trip, she met in Konya Scottish archaeologist William Mitchell Ramsay (1851‚Äì1939). The two decided to conduct excavations in Binbirkilise that took place in 1907. The results were published along with many photos in their book The Thousand and One Churches. When Bell returned to the site two years later, she found that a large part of the documented buildings had disappeared as a result of robbery for cut stone. Today, the state of destruction is much advanced as can be seen in comparison with Bell's photos. Turkish art historian Semavi Eyice examined the region and published the result of his research in 1971.  Bibliography  * Carl Holzmann (1904).

He co‚Äëfounded Instagram, the world's largest photo sharing website, along with Mike Krieger. Systrom was included on the list of America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40 2016. Under Systrom as CEO, Instagram became a fast growing app, with 800 million monthly users as of September 2017. He resigned as CEO of Instagram on September 24, 2018. Early life and education Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble, and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.Holliston native strikes it rich with smartphone app Instagram ‚Äì Framingham, MA. The MetroWest Daily News (April 12, 2012). Retrieved on 2013-08-20. Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He worked at Boston Beat, a vinyl record music store in Boston, while he was in high school. Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering. At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography. He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University. The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter. Career =Google= After graduating Stanford, he joined Google working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products. He spent two years at Google as a product marketer; Systrom left Google out of frustration of not being moved into the Associate Product Manager program. =Burbn= After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games. He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera. The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs. Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today. After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received US$500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, an HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users. =Instagram= In 2010, Systrom co‚Äëfounded the photo-sharing and, later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California. In April 2012, Instagram, along with 13 employees, was sold to Facebook for US$1 billion in cash and stock. According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom US$400 million based on his ownership stake in the business. One of the key contributions to the acquisition was that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook was \\"committed to building and growing Instagram independently\\", allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram. Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that \\"we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource\\". In an interview with Forbes, he stated that \\"Instagram is a new form of communication that's an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today's social media world. Instagram's a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or 'like' photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook.\\" Systrom identified Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014. Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013. Instagram offered 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II. Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram. As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram. As of June 2016, Instagram had over 500 million active users. Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top. Instagram as of early 2017 employed around 450 people. The app was used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day. Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employed more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram's daily user base. In May 2017, Systrom planned to better integrate the use of videos into Instagram. He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products. According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken. This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of The Innovator's Dilemma. On September 24, 2018, it was announced that Systrom resigned from Instagram and would be leaving in few weeks.  Views on copying ideas in the industry  Instagram has been accused on multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat. Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are \\"remixes\\" of existing products, and that \\"all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour\\". Systrom also argued that 'you can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology' and that this was simply 'just the way Silicon Valley works.'  Forbes list  In 2014, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category. In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of US$1.1 billion. The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.  Personal life  According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys \\"fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California's Lake Tahoe\\". In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people \\"across borders, cultures and generations\\". On October 31, 2016, Systrom married Nicole Systrom (n√©e Schuetz), founder and CEO of clean-energy investment firm Sutro Energy Group, in Napa, California. The two met at Stanford and were engaged in 2014.

He was a Danish field marshal and also the last Duke of Brunswick-Bevern.  Life  He was the son of Duke Ernest Ferdinand of Brunswick-Bevern (1682‚Äì1746) and his wife, Eleanor Charlotte of Courland. In 1742, he entered the Dutch army as captain and fought two campaigns in 1745 and 1746. He then switched to the Brunswick army and also served as a volunteer in the imperial army. Under the guidance of his uncle Louis Ernest, he commanded the Both'sche regiment during the War of the Austrian Succession. After the Treaty of Aix- la-Chapelle (1748), returned to the Dutch army, where he was promoted to Major General in 1754. After the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, he travelled to Dresden at the end of 1756, where King Frederick II of Prussia gave him command of the Saxon infantry regiment Prince Xaver. However, his soldiers mutinied and ran away and King Frederick held Frederick Charles Ferdinand responsible. He left the Prussian army in 1759 and joined the British army. He fought in the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759 under his cousin Ferdinand. He then joined the Danish army, where he was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1761 and to Command of the Guards on Foot in 1762 and to Inspector General of the Infantry in 1764. In 1766, he was appointed governor of Rendsburg and in 1773 governor of Copenhagen. In 1781, his elder brother August William died and Frederick Charles Ferdinand inherited Brunswick-Bevern and became provost of St. Blaise and the St. Cyriacus Abbey in Brunswick. However, with permission of the King of Denmark, who promoted him to field marshal in 1782, he took up residence in Gl√ºcksburg Castle. On 26 October 1782, he married Princess Anna Caroline (1751‚Äì1824), the daughter of Prince William Henry of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken and the widow of Duke Frederick Henry William of Schleswig- Holstein-Gl√ºcksburg. In 1793, he created a foundation for poor relief in his capital Bevern. After Brunswick was occupied by Napoleon's troops in 1806, he took in the sons of Duke Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel. Frederick Charles Ferdinand died childless in 1809.

Reception The film received mixed reviews, with many criticizing the decision to have the actor portraying Vysotsky to wear a mask.

He has published five books and numerous magazine articles. In particular, his \\"I Don't Want to Be Chinese\\" (), a book which criticises certain aspects of traditional Chinese culture, was a best-seller in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and though banned in mainland China, nevertheless generated controversy on the Internet there, with both support from readers and attacks from critics. Joe Chung was born in the 1960s in Hong Kong. He became concerned with Chinese politics following the imprisonment of Wei Jingsheng in 1979. In 1991 he completed his master's degree in sociology at Chinese University of Hong Kong. In the elections of 1994 and 1999 for the District Councils of Hong Kong (known as District Boards before 1997), he represented the Hong Kong Democratic Party in the geographical constituency of Wong Tai Sin but was not elected. In 2001 he openly called for independence of Taiwan and was criticised by the Chinese Communist Party as \\"more arrogant than Taiwan separatists\\". He is a frequent contributor to Hong Kong Open magazine. In 2012 he contributed several articles to the Apple Daily regarding National Education in Hong Kong and the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands. Political activism In a 1990s, Joe Chung was frequently active in pro-democratic approach human rights activities in Hong Kong. On 9 July 1995, Joe Chung and other activists burnt the flag of the People's Republic of China outside the offices of Xinhua in Hong Kong to protest the arrest by the Chinese authorities of Harry Wu, the Chinese penal colony researcher. On 30 November 1995, Wei Jingsheng Action Group chairman Joe Chung, accompanied by other members of the Wei Jingsheng Action Group, publicly burned a cartoon image of Chinese Communist leader Deng Xiaoping to demand the release of democracy campaigner Wei Jingsheng. The event occurred outside the office of the Xinhua News Agency in Happy Valley on Thursday, 29 November 1995. Both these events were widely reported by local media and news agencies the following day.  Taiwan independence controversy On 4 May 2000, (the anniversary of the 4 May movement), Joe Chung published an op-ed piece in the Hong Kong Ming Pao, titled \\"Taiwan Has the Right to Independence\\" (). An article in the Sing Tao published in Hong Kong on 20 May 2000 titled \\"\\" (Joe Chung accused of inciting break-up of China as Communist newspapers bombard the Ming Pao) commented on the following events. According to the article, the Communist affiliated Hong Kong newspapers Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po responded to Joe Chung's article with a barrage of over 20 articles in the following days with articles such as \\"Taiwan Has No Right to Independence\\" () in the Wen Wei Po on 9 May 2000. The articles refuted Chung's arguments, accusing him of \\"splitting China\\", \\"contravening article 23 of the Basic Law\\", and being a \\"traitor\\" to China. They also attacked the Ming Pao, accusing it of breaking its promise to \\"publish a Chinese newspaper for Chinese people\\". Sing Tao Daily noted that concerted, sustained attacks by the Communist press of this ferocity had not been seen since the pre-handover 1990s when the Communist press had attacked Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. The article also noted that Joe Chung was both glad that his article had stirred up debate, but feared for his personal safety as result. Also according to the article, Ming Pao declined to publish Joe Chung's rebuttal of these attacks, saying that enough had been said on the matter. After the publication of the Sing Tao article, the attacks continued with articles such as \\"Some 'Chinese People' Who Hate Their Own Country\\" () published in the Ta Kung Pao, on 29 May 2001. I Don't Want to be Chinese Again () This is Joe Chung's best selling book and at the time of writing in 2012, five years after publication in 2007, it is still one of the 10 best- selling non-fiction books in Hong Kong retailer CP store, according to their website: http://www.cp1897.com.hk/cpStore_news.php?id=48.

It was named for General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. on July 18, 1917.  Location  Camp MacArthur was located on a 10,699 acre tract of land in northwest Waco, Texas. On March 7, 1919, the camp closed and the land was encompassed into the city of Waco.  History  Shorty after the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, Waco was chosen as a site for a military training camp. 10,700 acres of cotton fields and black land farms were chosen as the cite for construction. Camp MacArthur began its $5 million construction on July 20, 1917. The cite was named for Lt. Gen Arthur MacArthur who was a medal of honor recipient and fought in two American wars. In September 1917, 18,000 troops arrived at Camp MacArthur. Most of those soldiers were from Wisconsin and Michigan, so their arrival boosted the Waco population. Even though Camp MacArthur was built to hold about 45,000 troops, no more than 28,000 ever lived inside the compound. Within the camp was an officer's training school, demobilization facility, and an infantry replacement and training camp, as well as a hospital, administrative offices, and a tent camp. Loretta Johnston, who was a nurse at Camp MacArthur, wrote of the hospital. She described it as \\"very pleasing to the eye\\" and a \\"pleasant place for [the] sick and convalescent soldiers. The Thirty-Second (Red Arrow) division based at Camp MacArthur participated in combat in France in 1918. Between 1917 and 1919, 45,074 soldiers were stationed at Camp MacArthur, nearly doubling the town's population and boosting the area's wartime economy. After the close of the camp, some of its materials were used to build United States-Mexican border stations. After the War's conclusion, many soldiers returned to Waco. Some of the materials were used to build neighborhoods in Waco.

Tanner was a native of Rhode Island. He moved to New York when fairly young. Of his 21 children from three successive wives (his first two wives died before he married his next wife), 14 lived to adulthood. Tanner was a Baptist until he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1832. He was baptized by Jared Carter. Ten of his 14 children who lived to adulthood affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and eventually moved to Utah Territory. In late 1834, Tanner sold his property in and around Lake George, New York which included a hotel. He then moved to Kirtland, Ohio where in early 1835 he lent money and assumed loans to keep the building of the Kirtland Temple moving forward. When Joseph Smith tried to repay him he refused any payment saying they owed him nothing. Tanner moved with the main body of the Church to Missouri, where he was on one occasion attacked as a result of mob and government persecution that led to the Saints fleeing the state. He then moved to Montrose, Iowa where he lived for six years. He then moved for a time to Nauvoo, Illinois. Tanner eventually went west with the pioneers. He led the large family of his son-in-law Amasa Lyman west, since Lyman was in the advanced pioneer company. Two of Tanner's sons were in the Mormon Battalion. He settled in Cottonwood, Utah Territory where he died in 1850. Legacy and descendants T. C. Christensen produced a short film based on Tanner's life, Treasure in Heaven: The John Tanner Story. ;Children Sidney Tanner was involved in the Battle of Crooked River. He then lived in Montrose. His wife and the three youngest of his five children all died at the time that they joined the body of the Mormons in heading west. He later served on the city council and the Mormon high council in San Bernardino, California. In 1857 he moved to Utah, eventually settling in Beaver. He was a polygamist and had 22 children.George Shepherd Tanner, John Tanner and His Family, The John Tanner Family Association, Publishers Press, Salt Lake City, Utah (1974) John Joshua Tanner and Nathan Tanner were part of Zion's Camp. Louisa Maria Tanner married Amasa M. Lyman. Albert Tanner and Myron Tanner were in the Mormon Battalion. ;Other descendants Among Tanner's grandchildren were Joseph M. Tanner and Francis M. Lyman (the son of his daughter Louisa Maria). His granddaughter Emily S. Tanner Richards was one of the main founders of the Utah Woman's Suffrage Association. Other prominent later descendants of John Tanner were Hugh B. Brown and N. Eldon Tanner, members of the First Presidency of the LDS Church, and John S.

History According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, Walcot is derived from the Old English 'walh' with 'cot', which means \\"cottage(s) of the Britons\\".Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.479. Walcot is a probable site of prehistoric or Roman settlement. Earthworks indicating rectilinear ditched enclosures and a circular dwelling have been found, evidenced through crop marks and aerial photographs. Medieval ridge and furrow field systems have also been recorded. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village is written as \\"Walecote\\". In 1086 it consisted of 6 villagers, 14 freemen and 5 smallholders, land for 6 plough teams, a meadow and a church.

Both Heathcote and Brown were Lord of the Manor and principal landowners.Marrat, W.

The parish contained 193 people within of land. Sir William Heathcote, 5th Baronet, was lord of the manor, and also improprtiator of ecclesiastical parish tithes‚Äîreceiving (typically) one-tenth of the produce or profits of the land‚Äîand patron of the incumbent's vicarage, which was held by the vicar of Folkingham, who was supported by glebe‚Äîan area of land used to support a parish priest‚Äîof at Quadring, at Mareham le Fen and at Spanby. Close to the village was a chalybeate spring, White's stating that it was \\"formally noted for medicinal virtues, but it lost its reputation many years ago\\". The poor of the parish received coal at Christmas, paid for by a yearly ¬£14 rental from just over of land at Walcot, and at Spanby; a further 10 shillings yearly came from land rent at Newton. Parish professions and trades listed included the parish vicar, the parish clerk, a schoolmistress of the infants' school, the landlord of the Black Horse public house, a toll keeper, a dressmaker, two tailors, one of whom was also a draper, a shopkeeper, a carpenter, a blacksmith, five farmers, two of whom were also graziers, and a carrier‚Äîtransporter of goods and occasionally people between centres of trade‚Äîoperating between the village and both Bourne and Sleaford.White, William (1872), Whites Directory of Lincolnshire, p.590 In 1885 Kelly's Directory noted that the village contained \\"springs of very pure water‚Ä¶ one strongly chalybeate\\".

The architectural style is mainly Decorated, the interior being of an earlier, Early English date. It consists of a Perpendicular clerestory, a nave, aisles, and a tower with crocketed broached spire containing 4 bells. In the aisle to the south is a canopied niche with buttresses and pinnacles. In the chancel is a piscina and a priest‚Äôs door. Pevsner notes a 17th-century south entrance panelled door incorporating a wicket gate, and the existence of an 1809 paten by William Fountain.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire p.702 ; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press.

Description  The body of an organism is elongated and ovoided. It has a curved anterior apex that is over the peristome. It has a cytostome which is a two-layered undulating membrane, on the right front edge, and also contractile vacuole with cytopyge terminal. It is either brown or rose-coloured. Conjugation Blepharisma japonicum produces sexual pheromones that promote conjugation. There are two mating types (I and II), each type excreting a specific pheromone (termed gamone 1 and gamone 2, respectively). When sexually mature mating-type I cells are moderately starved, they autonomously produce and secrete gamone I. Gamone 1 specifically acts on mating-type II cells, transforming them so that they can unite with type I cells, and inducing them to secrete gamone 2. Gamone 2 then transforms type I cells so that they can unite with type II cells. Cells that can unite may then undergo conjugation. Sexual reproduction involving interaction of opposite mating types promotes outcrossing and the masking of deleterious recessive mutations in the diploid stage of the sexual life cycle.

Insurgents launched the 2012 spring offensive on multiple locations, including government buildings, military bases, and embassies. Attacks occurred in four Afghan provinces, including Kabul and Paktia. Different reports attribute responsibility for the attacks to either Taliban or the Haqqani network although the Taliban have claimed responsibility.  Background  Between 1996 and 2001, the Taliban controlled large portions of Afghanistan following their emergence as a power bloc in 1992. The majority of Taliban political control centered on Kandahar, although the executive government remained based in the capital, Kabul. During the early parts of the war in Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force established a presence in Afghanistan, predominantly around Kabul. Following a period of stabilization in Afghanistan, attacks started to increase with a growth in suicide bombings since 2006. In 2007, the number of Afghan civilian deaths stood at more than 230. In 2008, there were about 1,000 civilian deaths attributed to the Taliban. In 2011, the number of civilians killed rose 8% from 2010, with over 3,000 civilian deaths. The vast majority of the casualties were due to activities by insurgents. According to the Associated Press, there are around 25,000 Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan in 2012. Insurgent activities follow an annual pattern with members of the various insurgent groups migrating out of Afghanistan in the winter months. The Spring Offensive is the yearly increase in offensive activity, related to the improving weather, which increases the insurgent groups' ability to maneuver around the country.  Attacks  In the capital of Kabul, many foreign embassies are located in the so-called \\"Say Wallah\\" of the capital. Since NATO took control of the ISAF in 2003, their headquarters is also in the Green Zone. Major General Carsten Jacobson, the spokesperson for the International Security Assistance Force, said that militants attacked the United States, German, and British embassies in Kabul. The Iranian embassy was also attacked, as was the newly built Kabul Star hotel. The governor of Laghman Province, Lutfullah Mashal, said that men plotted to kill Karim Khalili, the second Vice President of Afghanistan. Within hours, Afghan security forces and Norwegian special forces captured or killed almost all of the militants. Norwegian special forces from the H√¶rens Jegerkommando was crucial in fighting back the attack.http://www.nrk.no/verden/store_-_-ingen-norske-saret-1.8073796 Throughout the offensive on the embassies and government buildings in Kabul, members of the Afghan military, Afghan National Police, and National Directorate of Security repelled attacks from the Taliban, including suicide bombers. During early Monday morning, NATO helicopters searched for militants hiding in buildings near the ISAF headquarters and multiple embassies. The attack on Kabul lasted 18 hours. At the end of the siege on Kabul, almost 40 militants and eight Afghan soldiers were killed. In addition, four civilians were killed and 25 were injured across the country. The Taliban militants reportedly wore suicide vests and carried both rocket-propelled and hand grenades. A lone suspected attacker captured by Afghan forces reportedly confessed Taliban assailants who waged the co-ordinated attacks across Afghanistan were part of a 200-member suicide squad trained in Pakistan. According to Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, the attacks were \\"well- coordinated and planned for almost two months\\".  Aftermath  General John R. Allen, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force, praised the Afghan military's ability to repel the Taliban attacks, saying \\"They [Afghan security forces] were on scene immediately, well-led and well- coordinated.\\" President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai applauded the actions by Afghan security forces. He told CNN that \\"the Afghan forces will be able to defend their country as they demonstrated yesterday\\". However, Karzai said that the attacks were a result of an \\"intelligence failure for us [Afghanistan] and especially NATO\\" and called for an investigation. Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, the Interior Minister of Afghanistan, said the attackers belonged to the Haqqani Network, an insurgency group based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of Iran, Ramin Mehmanparast, denounced the attacks, saying \\"\\"The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns the recent terrorist attacks in the capital and certain other provinces of Afghanistan, particularly the attacks on diplomatic centers based in Kabul, and believes that dialogue is the only solution to Afghanistan's security problems.\\" The United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Foreign Minister of Pakistan Hina Rabbani Khar condemned the attacks in Afghanistan in a joint statement. The Pakistani Foreign Minister also called the Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Zalmai Rassoul to express her condolences. Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard said that Australian forces in Afghanistan will be returning home in the upcoming months, with most troops coming home at the end of 2013. On Tuesday, 17 April, Karzai said the Taliban attacks \\"prolong foreign presence in Afghanistan\\".

When recharging, aluminium ions return to the negative electrode, and can exchange three electrons per ion. This means that insertion of one is equivalent to three Li+ ions in conventional intercalation cathodes. Thus, since the ionic radii of (0.54 √Ö) and Li+ (0.76 √Ö) are similar, significantly higher models of electrons and ions can be accepted by the cathodes without much pulverization.Zafar, Z. A., et al. (2017). \\"Cathode materials for rechargeable aluminum batteries: current status and progress.\\" J. Mater. Chem. A 5(12): 5646-5660 http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/ta/c7ta00282c#!divAbstract The trivalent charge carrier, is both the advantage and disadvantage of this battery. While transferring 3 units of charge by one ion significantly increase the energy storage capacity but the electrostatic intercalation of the host materials with a trivalent cation is too strong for well-defined electrochemical behaviour. Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron- redox properties leading to high capacity. The inertness of aluminum and the ease of handling in an ambient environment is expected to offer significant safety improvements for this kind of battery. In addition, aluminum possesses a higher volumetric capacity than Li, K, Mg, Na, Ca and Zn owing to its high density ( at 25 ¬∞C) and ability to exchange three electrons. This again means that the energy stored in aluminum-batteries on a per volume basis is higher than that in other metal-based batteries. Hence, aluminum-batteries are expected to be smaller in size. Al-ion batteries also have a higher number of charge-discharge cycles. Thus, Al-ion batteries have the potential to replace Li-ion batteries. Design Like all other batteries, the basic structure of aluminium-ion batteries includes two electrodes connected by an electrolyte, an ionically (but not electrically) conductive material acting as a medium for the flow of charge carriers. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, where the mobile ion is Li+, aluminum forms a complex with chloride in most electrolytes and generates an anionic mobile charge carrier, usually AlCl4- or Al2Cl7-. The amount of energy or power that a battery can release is dependent on factors including the battery cell's voltage, capacity and chemical composition. A battery can maximize its energy output levels by: * Increasing chemical potential difference between the two electrodes * Reducing the mass of reactants * Preventing the electrolyte from being modified by the chemical reactions Electrochemistry Anode half reaction: {Al} + {7AlCl4^-} <=> {4Al2Cl7^-} + {3e^-} Cathode half reaction: {2MnO2} + {Li+} + {e^-} <=> {LiMn2O4} Combining the two half reactions yields the following reaction: {Al} + {7AlCl4^-} + {6MnO2} + {3Li+} <=> {4Al2Cl7^-} + {3LiMn2O4} Lithium-ion comparison Aluminium-ion batteries are conceptually similar to lithium-ion batteries, but possess an aluminum anode instead of a lithium anode. While the theoretical voltage for aluminium-ion batteries is lower than lithium-ion batteries, 2.65 V and 4 V respectively, the theoretical energy density potential for aluminium-ion batteries is 1060 Wh/kg in comparison to lithium-ion's 406 Wh/kg limit. Today's lithium ion batteries have high power density (fast discharge) and high energy density (hold a lot of charge). They can also develop dendrites, similar to splinters, that can short-circuit a battery and lead to a fire. Aluminum also transfers energy more efficiently. Inside a battery, atoms of the element ‚Äî lithium or aluminum ‚Äî give up some of their electrons, which flow through external wires to power a device. Because of their atomic structure, lithium ions can only provide one electron at a time; aluminum can give three at a time. Aluminum is also more abundant than lithium, lowering material costs.  Challenges  Aluminium-ion batteries have a relatively short shelf life. The combination of heat, rate of charge, and cycling can dramatically decrease energy capacity. One of the primary reasons for this short shelf life is the fracture of the traditional graphite anode, the Al ions being far larger than the Li ions used in conventional battery systems. When metal ion batteries are fully discharged, they can no longer be recharged. Ionic electrolytes, while improving safety and the long term stability of the devices by minimizing corrosion, are expensive to manufacture and purchase and may therefore be unsuited to the mass production of Al ion devices. In addition, current breakthroughs are only in limited laboratory settings, where a lot more work needs to be done on scaling up the production for use in commercial settings.  Research  Various research teams are experimenting with aluminium and other chemical compounds to produce the most efficient, long lasting, and safe battery. =Oak Ridge National Laboratory= Around 2010, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed and patented a high energy density device, producing 1,060 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) versus 406 Wh/kg for lithium-ion batteries. ORNL used an ionic electrolyte, instead of the typical aqueous electrolyte which can produce hydrogen gas during operation and corrode the aluminium anode. The electrolyte was made of 3-ethyl-1-methylimidazolium chloride with excess aluminium trichloride. However, ionic electrolytes are less conductive, reducing power density. Reducing anode/cathode separation can offset the limited conductivity, but causes heating. ORNL devised a cathode made up of spinel manganese oxide further reducing corrosion. =Cornell University= In 2011 at Cornell University, a research team used the same electrolyte as ORNL, but used vanadium oxide nanowires for the cathode. Vanadium oxide displays an open crystal structure, allowing greater surface area for an aluminium structure and reduces the path between cathode and anode, maximizing energy output levels. The device produced a large output voltage during operation. However, the battery had a low coulombic efficiency. =Stanford University= In April 2015 researchers at Stanford University claimed to have developed an aluminum- ion battery with a recharge time of about one minute (for an unspecified battery capacity). They claimed that their battery has no possibility of catching fire, offering a video of a hole being drilled into the battery while it was generating electricity. Their cell provides about 2 volts, 4 volts if connected in a series of two cells.Aluminum-Ion Battery Cell Is Durable, Fast- Charging, Bendable: Stanford Inventors (Video), John Voelcker, 8 April 2015, Green Car Reports The prototype lasted over 7,500 charge-discharge cycles with no loss of capacity.Nature 2015-05-16 An ultrafast rechargeable aluminium-ion battery The \\"ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery\\" is made of an aluminum anode, liquid electrolyte, isolation foam, and a graphite cathode. During the charging process, AlCl4- ions intercalates among the graphene stacked layers. While discharging, AlCl4- ions are rapidly de-intercalated through the graphene stacked layers. The features of Al-ion batteries include: *A fast charge discharge cycle that can be completed in one minute *High durability that allows the battery to withstand more than 10,000 cycles without a capacity decay *Improved safety, as the thin battery cell is stable, nontoxic, and bendable (i.e., it will not catch fire even if damaged by drilling) *Low cost, as the acquisition cost of raw materials are relatively cheap. This could allow the Al-ion batteries to be used in not only electronic devices, but electric bikes and motorcycles, golf carts, lift trucks, wind turbines, solar cells etc. In 2016, the lab tested these cells through collaborating with Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to power a motorbike. However, that version of the battery had one major drawback in that it needed an expensive electrolyte. In 2017, the newest version includes a urea-based electrolyte and is about 100 times cheaper than the 2015 model, with higher efficiency and a charging time of 45 minutes. It is the first time urea has been used in a battery. The battery exhibits ‚àº99.7% Coulombic efficiency and a substantial rate capability of 100 mA/g at a cathode capacity of 73 mAh/g (1.4 C). =ALION Project= In June 2015, the High Specific Energy Aluminium-Ion Rechargeable Batteries for Decentralized Electricity Generation Sources (ALION) project was launched by a consortium of materials and component manufacturers and battery assemblers as a European Horizon 2020 project led by the LEITAT research institute.HIGH SPECIFIC ENERGY ALUMINIUM-ION RECHARGEABLE DECENTRALIZED ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCES on cordis.europa.euHORIZON 2020 ALION Project Kick Off Meeting @ LEITAT The objective of the project is to develop a prototype Al-ion battery that could be used for storage of electricity from decentralized sources, such as from renewable energy sources. The project is researching various cell and battery concepts as well as electroactive materials to achieve an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, a voltage of 48 volts and a charge-discharge life of 3000 cycles. In May 2019, the project came to an end and published its final results. After four years, the project showed that the high power and cycling performance of the Aluminium-ion battery technology made it an appealing alternative to current commercial products. For example, they found that Al-ion batteries could be a serious candidate to replace lead‚Äìacid batteries in uninterruptible power supplies. They also found uses in telecommunications and stationary applications for grid energy storage. 3D printing of the battery packs allowed for the largest Al-ion cells developed, with voltages ranging from 6 to 72 volts. =University Of Maryland= In 2016, a University of Maryland team reported a rechargeable aluminium/sulfur battery that utilizes a sulfur/carbon composite as the cathode material. The chemistry is able to provide a theoretical energy density of 1340 Wh/kg. The team made a prototype cell which demonstrated an energy density of 800 Wh/kg for over 20 cycles. =Zhejiang University Department of Polymer Science= In December 2017 a team, led by professor Gao Chao, from Department of Polymer Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University, announced the design of a battery using graphene films as cathode and metallic aluminium as anode. The 3H3C (Trihigh Tricontinuous) design results in a graphene film cathode with excellent electrochemical properties. The arrangement of graphene liquid crystals result in a highly oriented structure. A process of high temperature annealing under gas pressure produces a high quality and high channelling graphene structure. This 3H3C design creates an aluminium-graphene battery (Al-GB) which has impressive properties: *The battery works well after quarter-million cycles retaining 91.7 percent of its original capacity. *The battery can be fully charged in 1.1 seconds. *The assembled battery works well across a temperature range of minus 40 to 120 degrees Celsius. *It offers a high current capacity (111 mAh/g, 400 A/g based on the cathode). *It can be folded. *It does not explode when exposed to fire and the materials used are non flammable. However, the aluminum-ion battery cannot compete with commonly-used Li-ion batteries in terms of energy density, according to Gao.Elektor 2018-01-10 Al-ion battery retains 92% capacity after 250,000 charge cyclesXINHUANET 2017-12-23 Chinese scientists develop fast-charging aluminum-graphene battery =Clemson University= In 2017, researchers at Clemson Nanomaterials Institute built a prototype Al-ion battery that uses a graphene electrode to intercalate tetrachloroaluminate (). Their new battery technology uses aluminum foil and thin sheets of graphite called few-layer graphene (FLG) as the electrode to store electrical charge from aluminum ions present in the electrolyte. The team constructed batteries with aluminum anodes, pristine or modified FLG cathodes, and an ionic liquid with AlCl3 salt as the electrolyte. They claimed that the battery can operate over 10,000 cycles and the energy density is 200 Wh/kg. Their hope is to make aluminum batteries with higher energy to ultimately displace lithium-ion technology. = Queensland University of Technology = Researchers from QUT developed earth abundant cryptomelane based electrodes as cathode for Aluminum ion battery with aqueous electrolytes. = Anthraquinone = In 2019 researchers proposed using anthraquinone for the cathode in an aluminum ion battery.

The Court found that the emergency wiretap provisions found in section 184.4 of the Criminal Code infringes the search and seizure rights in section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and cannot be justified as a reasonable limitation under section 1 of the Charter due to the lack of accountability measures. In addition to the two parties to the case (the Attorney General of British Columbia and the various defendants), the Court heard from the following interveners: the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of Ontario, the Attorney General of Quebec, the Criminal Lawyers' Association (Ontario), the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. The unanimous decision of the Court was the first Supreme Court of Canada decision written by Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. Background =Section 184.4 of the Criminal Code= Generally, the police cannot intercept a person's private telecommunications (such as a wiretap), with certain exceptions, such as the consent of one of the parties to the communications in combination with judicial authorization, or with a warrant.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 184. and Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 184.2. Section 184.4 of the Criminal Code does not require any prior judicial authorization. Instead, three requirements must be met:Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 184.4. #The police officer has reasonable grounds that due to the urgency of the situation, prior judicial authorization cannot be obtained with reasonable diligence, #The police officer has reasonable grounds that the interception is necessary to prevent an unlawful act that would cause serious harm to any person or property, and #Either the person sending the communication or the person intended to receive the communication is the person who would perform the unlawful act in question, or is the victim or intended victim of the harm. =Incident= After family members received phone calls from an alleged kidnapping victim, where the victim stated he was being held for ransom, the police initiated an emergency wiretap under section 184.4. Approximately 24 hours later, they received judicial authorization for the wiretap. =Judicial history= As a result of the wiretap evidence, Yat Fung Albert Tse, Nhan Trong Ly, Viet Bac Nguyen, Huong Dac Doan, Daniel Luis Soux and Myles Alexander Vandrick were charged with various offences related to the kidnapping. At the trial, the trial judge found that section 184.4 was unconstitutional, as it violated section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This decision was part of a line of cases in the trial courts of British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario which found section 184.4 unconstitutional (but which differed in how to remedy the situation). The evidence was nonetheless admitted as evidence under section 24(2) of the Charter. The defendants were found guilty, and were sentenced between 10 and 18 years. The trial judge's decision on the constitutionality of the legislation was upheld by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and was appealed by the Crown to Supreme Court of Canada. Reasons of the Court The unanimous reasons of the Court were written by Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. =General constitutionality= The Court first noted that as a general proposition, unauthorized wiretaps in emergency situations could be constitutional, if the authorization was legislated correctly. =Scope of section 184.4= The Court noted that section 184.4 was the only provision in Canadian law for a wiretap that did not require the consent of one of the parties or require a pre-authorization, does not require prior notice, and has no legislated or judicially authorized time-limits. However, section 184.4 is limited to emergency situations where there is serious and imminent harm. The Court also found that the terms used in section 184.4 were not overly broad or vague. The Court also provided a limited scope of who could be considered a \\"victim\\". Although there is specified time-limit, the Court noted that as time goes on, there will be less justification for the argument that authorization cannot be obtained with reasonable diligence. =Interpretation in relation to section 188= Section 188 allows the police to seek prior judicial authorization in urgent situations. The Court found that section 188 does not do away with the need to be able to do a wiretap in an emergency situation, where even the reduced amount of time to obtain the section 188 authorization would take too long. =Lack of notice requirement= Other emergency legislation in Canada, which do not require prior judicial authorization, still requires an \\"after-the-fact\\" notice to be made to a judge or justice of the peace. Section 184.4 has no \\"after-the-fact\\" notice requirement. The Court found that notice ensured that the police would not abuse their extraordinary powers, and provides transparency to the process. As a result, the Court concluded that the lack of \\"after-the-fact\\" notice provisions rendered the current legislation unconstitutional. =Lack of reporting requirement to Parliament= Other wiretap provisions requires that Parliament be notified of each wiretap, so that Parliament can keep track of the frequency wiretaps are made, and under what circumstances. Section 184.4 has no reporting requirement. The Court found that since reporting to Parliament does not create active oversight of wiretaps generally, the lack of reporting does not make the provisions unconstitutional. =Lack of record-keeping requirement= The Court found that a record-keeping requirement would also increase accountability, but would not be necessary if there was a notice requirement. In an emergency situation, record-keeping may be impracticable. =Lack of limitations on use of interceptions= Section 184.1 of the Criminal Code, which allows wiretaps to prevent bodily harm, prevents the intercepted communications from being admitted as evidence, except in proceedings related to bodily harm. Section 184.4 has no similar limitations. The Court noted that sections 184.1 and 184.4 had different pre-requisites, and such statutory limitations for section 184.4 were not necessary. The Court chose not to comment on whether the intercepts would be admissible in proceedings unrelated to the emergency situation. =Section 1 of the Charter= Since the provisions were found unconstitutional due to the lack of accountability measures, the Court went on to decide where the legislation could be justified under the Oakes test for section 1 of the Charter. The second stage of the Oakes test requires that proportionality between the legislation and the objectives of the legislation. In this case, the ability to meet the objective of section 184.4 (using wiretaps in emergency situations) would not be impacted by a notice requirement. It would allow targeted individuals to later challenge invasions of privacy and obtain meaningful remedies. As a result, the Court found there was a lack of proportionality, and could not be saved under section 1 of the Charter. =Remedy= While it was open to the Court to read in a notice requirement, the Court found that it would be inappropriate in this case due to other concerns about the legislation expressed to the Court that the Court chose not to rule on. Therefore, the Court declared the legislation unconstitutional, but stayed the effect of their ruling for 12 months to give time for Parliament to enact a new version. Aftermath In the decision of R v Tse, the Supreme Court of Canada found that a wiretap authority without a court authorization in situations of imminent harm could be justified under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.CONSTITUTION ACT, 1982, CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS However, the Court declared that Section 184.4 of the Criminal Code (interception in exceptional circumstances), which was enacted in 1993, was unconstitutional because it contained no accountability measures. The Supreme Court gave Parliament until April 13, 2013 to amend the provision to make it constitutionally compliant. On February 11, 2013, the Honourable Rob Nicholson, P.C., Q.C., M.P. for Niagara Falls, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, introduced Bill C-55,HOUSE OF COMMONS OF CANADA, BILL C-55 An Act to amend the Criminal Code (\\"Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in R. v. Tse Act\\") that directly responds to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R v Tse. During his press conference on the same day, Minister Nicholson said the controversial Bill C-30,Parliament of Canada, Bill C-30 known as the online surveillance or warrantless wiretapping bill, won't go ahead due to opposition from the public.CBC news, Government killing online surveillance bill The bill, which was known as the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act, was designed to help police combat child pornography. But civil liberties and privacy groups ‚Äì even the federal privacy commissioner ‚Äì said the bill violated the rights of Canadians. =Changes made by Bill C-55= Unlike its predecessor, the new bill, C-55, simply responds to the guidance from the Supreme Court by adding the safeguards of \\"notification\\" and \\"reporting\\" to section 184.4 of the Criminal Code.Department of Justice, GOVERNMENT OF CANADA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO RESPOND TO SUPREME COURT DECISION IN R. V. TSE Bill C-55 would make three specific changes: #Notification within 90 days ‚Äì Notification would require that persons whose private communications have been intercepted in situations of imminent harm be notified within 90 days (subject to any extensions granted by a judge). #Annual reports ‚Äì Reporting would require annual reports on the use of imminent harm wiretaps. #Restricting the usage ‚Äì The changes would limit the authority to use this provision to police officers (currently, it is available to the broader category of peace officers) and only to the offences listed in section 183 of the Criminal Code. Bill C-55 is supported by the New Democratic Party (NDP) and by the Liberal Party of Canada.Parliament of Canada, EDITED HANSARD ‚Ä¢ NUMBER 213 =Critiques= Ms. Fran√ßoise Boivin, NDP member from Gatineau and her party‚Äôs justice critic, made some critical remarks when Bill C-55 was debated at second in the House of Commons: \\"I cannot believe that the brilliant legal minds at the Department of Justice took 11 months to draft Bill C-55. The fact is that the Conservatives made a serious mistake at the outset. They introduced Bill C-30 thinking that it would solve every conceivable problem related to wiretaps.\\"Parliament of Canada, Official Report (at 1230) Mr. Francis Scarpaleggia (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.) made similar critical remarks: \\"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-55, the bill we are debating today, needs to be seen against the backdrop of Bill C-30, the government's Internet surveillance bill introduced in February 2012. When Bill C-30 was tabled it crashed and burned, largely because the government failed to do its homework. Mainly, the government did not Charter-proof the bill or listen to telecommunications service providers about the impracticality of some of Bill C-30's key provisions, nor did the government properly gauge Canadians' views about such a bill in advance of introducing it.\\" Parliament of Canada, Official Report (at 1300) =Proposed amendment to Bill C-55= When the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) appeared before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights on March 6, 2013, it demanded changes to Bill C-55, which would allow emergency warrantless wiretaps of unlimited duration.Parliament of Canada, Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights In particular, the BCCLA urged Parliament to limit emergency warrantless wiretapping by the police to a 24-hour period.BCCLA, BCCLA urges Parliament to put a 24-hour limit on warrantless wiretaps Ms. Raji Mangat, Counsel at the BCCLA, said during her testimony, \\"A wiretap captures all communications taking place on the tapped device, including any and all manner of private, personal and possibly even privileged, confidential communications. Sweeping powers that intrude on the privacy rights of individuals must be appropriately limited by the law. We understand that in very narrow circumstances, the police may need to act immediately to stop serious and imminent harm. However, it is all the more important that this extraordinary power not be used indefinitely where no warrant is required. A 24-hour limit on the use of the warrantless wiretap will give the police clear guidance about how they can use this power appropriately.\\" Despite this concern, the BCCLA‚Äôs proposed amendment was not accepted by Conservative committee members and Bill C-55 has been reported back to the House of Commons unamended. =Royal Assent and Coming Into Force= Bill C-55 passed its third reading in the House of Commons on March 20, 2013.LEGISLATION RESPONDING TO SUPREME COURT DECISION IN R. v. TSE PASSES THE HOUSE OF COMMONS On March 26, 2013, Bill C-55 has been adopted by the Senate legislative committee. It was subsequently referred back to the Senate for the third reading and received Royal Assent on March 27, 2013.

The book helped launch Baddeck, and Cape Breton more broadly, as a tourist destination and may have influenced Alexander Graham Bell's decision to build a home in Baddeck.

It is not to be confused with 'Crouch Hill\\" which runs between Crouch End and Stroud Green. The two roads meet at a \\"Y\\" junction in Crouch End and together the two routes constitute the southern access to Crouch End Broadway. The street proceeds up a steep hill to the top of the ridge which here divides Haringey from Islington. The old name for this ridge along which Hornsey Lane runs and which forms the northern boundary of the Parkland Walk between Crouch End Hill and Crouch Hill is the \\"Hog's Back\\". The street is part of London Buses route 41 and London Buses route 91 Buildings The King's Head pub On the way up the hill on the right hand side can be found the \\"Lanacombe Sauna\\" briefly famous for a court case in 2000 in which the then owner was prosecuted as a brothel keeper.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/madam- ran-pound75m-vice-empire-from-wheelchair-710848.html Further up, still on the right hand side as proceeding from Crouch End, can be seen Christchurch. This fine Church of England building was designed by Arthur Blomfield and consecrated by Archibald Tait, Bishop of London, on Friday 27 June 1862.http://christchurchn8.org.uk/ A short distance beyond Christchurch is to be seen the original site of Coleridge Primary School, now called Coleridge West, with facing it across the road the former premises of the Hornsey College of Art now Coleridge East. The two sites are linked across the road by a light controlled pedestrian crossing.  The Parkland Walk  Crouch End Hill then uses a bridge to cross over a public walkway called the Parkland Walk, a public foot and cycle path and linear Park that stretches from Finsbury Park to Alexandra Palace, and follows some of the course of the Northern Heights planned rail extension to the Northern line, abandoned on 9 February 1954. The only remaining buildings relating to Crouch End Station can be seen just before the bridge on the left hand side of the road; one is a building frequently used as an office, the other is a cafe called the \\"Crescent Cafe\\" after nearby Crescent Road, and which is clearly marked. There is a zebra crossing at this point. Beside the cafe is an access by stairs to the platforms of Crouch End Station and thence to the Parkland Walk and Crouch Hill Park and to the site occupied by Ashmount Primary School from January 2013. (There is also step free access to the Walk by a ramp from Crescent Road.) Immediately beyond the bridge there is a T junction with Hornsey Lane joining from the right with Crouch End Hill continuing straight on down the other side of the ridge, now in the London Borough of Islington and now Hornsey Rise.

It is one of the fastest runaway stars in the Milky Way with a radial velocity around . It was discovered by Paul W. Merrill in 1938, identified as a high-velocity Wolf‚ÄìRayet star. It is listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as QR Sagittae with a range of 0.08 magnitudes. Distance A 2010 study of WR 124 directly measured the expansion rate of the M1-67 nebula expelled from the star using Hubble Space Telescope camera images taken 11 years apart, and compared that to the expansion velocity measured by the Doppler shift of the nebular emission lines. This yielded a distance of , which is less than previous studies, and the resulting luminosity of 150,000 times the Sun () is much lower than previously calculated. The luminosity is also lower than predicted by models for a star of this spectral class. Previous studies had found distances of to , with corresponding luminosities of , as expected for a typical WN8h which is a very young star just moving away from the main sequence. The Gaia satellite measured the distance to WR 124 from its parallax, giving a distance of . Physical characteristics With an assumed visual absolute magnitude of -7.22 and 3.1 magnitudes of extinction, WR 124 would be away. The temperature of around 40,000K means that most of its energy is emitted at ultraviolet wavelengths, the bolometric luminosity is and the radius is . The mass is calculated from evolutionary models to be . WR 124 is measured to still be about 15% hydrogen with most of the remaining mass being helium. A young highly massive and luminous WN8h star would still be burning hydrogen in its core, but a less luminous and older star would be burning helium in its core. The result of modelling the star purely from its observed characteristics is a luminosity of and a mass of , corresponding to a relatively young hydrogen-burning star at around . In either case, it has only a few hundred thousand years before it explodes as a type Ib or Ic supernova. The mass loss rate is ‚Äì per year, depending on the distance and properties determined for the star. Nebula WR 124 is surrounded by an intensely hot nebula formed from the star's extreme stellar wind. The nebula M1-67 is expanding at a rate of over and is nearly 6 light-years across, leading to the dynamical age of 20,000 years. M1-67 has little internal structure, though large clumps of material have been detected, some of which have 30 times the mass of Earth and stretch out up to . If placed in the Solar System, one of these clumps would span the distance from the Sun to Saturn.

Viewed from the east at formal entrance gates Weare Giffard is a small village, civil parish and former manor in the Torridge district, in north Devon. The church and manor house are situated 2 1/2 miles NW of Great Torrington in Devon. Most of the houses within the parish are situated some 1/2-mile east of the church. The church is situated on a hillside to the north and slightly above the wide and flat valley floor of the River Torridge. The Church of the Holy Trinity and the adjacent Weare Giffard Hall are designated members of the Grade I listed buildings in Devon. History The historian of Devon Tristram Risdon (d.1640)Risdon, T, op.cit., p. 278 supposed the name Weare to be derived from a fish weir which was historically situated in the river to catch fish. The construction of a fish- weir generally required a licence from the feudal overlord, as naturally these affected the catches of other inhabitants further along the river. Many disputes are recorded in the medieval records over disputes concerning fish- weirs. Descent of the manor =Giffard= Arms of Giffard: Sable, three fusils conjoined in fesse ermine. These arms can be seen in Chittlehampton Church, Devon, on the monument of John Giffard (d. 1622) of Brightley. They came to prominence again in the 19th century as the arms of Harding Giffard (1823‚Äì1921), Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, who was elevated to the peerage in 1885 as Baron Halsbury of Halsbury in the County of Devon, and was created Earl of Halsbury in 1898 One of the earliest holders of the manor was the 13th-century Sir Walter Giffard, after whom the manor subsequently took its suffix, who lived during the reign of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272). He left a daughter Emma as his sole heiress who married three times: *Firstly to Hugh Widworthy, without issue. *Secondly to Sir William Trewin, for whom she produced issue, William Trewin, who took the surname \\"de Wear\\" in lieu of his patronymic. *Thirdly to Sir Robert Dynham, without issue. Stone effigies of an early member of the Giffard family and his wife exist in the Parish Church, now housed separately in arched niches set into the north wall of the nave. They are believed to represent Sir Walter Giffard and his wife Lady Alice de St George, whose son was also named Walter, however no identifying inscriptions or armorials survive to confirm any attribution of identity. The original location of these effigies was in the north transept, from which they were removed in the 19th century to make room for the new organ. Surviving branches of Giffard The estate of Brightley in the parish of Chittlehampton, about 10 miles east of Weare Giffard, was acquired by Sir Roger Giffard (d.1547) on his marriage to Margaret Coblegh, the heiress of Brightley. Over the porch of Brightley Barton, now a large farmhouse, still exists an escutcheon bearing the arms of Giffard. Roger was a son of Sir Thomas Giffard (c. 1461‚Äì1513) of the manor of Halsbury, about 13 miles west of Weare Giffard. The Giffards of Halsbury appear to have been a cadet line of the Giffards of Weare. Bartholomew Giffard (died c. 1314) of Clovelly, married Joan de Halsbury, the heiress of Halsbury.

The Filleigh Estate, comprising some 5,500 acres (22 km2), together with Castle Hill mansion is still today privately owned by descendants of the Fortescue family. The last Earl Fortescue to own Castle Hill was Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue (1888‚Äì1958) who died in June 1958, aged 70. As he had no surviving male issue he was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, Denzil Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue. However the 5th Earl bequeathed Castle Hill, his principal seat, to his elder surviving daughter, Lady Margaret Fortescue (b. 1923) and bequeathed Weare Giffard to his younger daughter Lady Elizabeth Fortescue (b. 1926),Lauder, R., op.cit. p.80 who sold the manor in 1960. Lady Margaret had married in 1948 Bernard van Cutsem, and had issue.

B 86, 100506(R) (2012), , arXiv:1202.5533 These results demonstrate that previous T1 times were not limited by Josephson junction losses. Understanding the fundamental limits on the coherence time in superconducting qubits such as the transmon is an active area of research.  Comparison to Cooper-Pair Box  Schematical qubit energy levels diagram evolution from charge qubit (top, E_{\\\\rm J}/E_{\\\\rm C}=1) to transmon (bottom, E_{\\\\rm J}/E_{\\\\rm C}=50), plotted for the first 3 energy levels (m=0,1,2), as function of the average number n_g of Cooper pairs across the junction, normalized to the gap between the ground and the first excited state. The charge qubit (top) is normally operated at the n_g=0.5 \\"sweet spot\\", where fluctuations in n_g cause less energy shift, and the anharmonicity is maximal. Transmon (bottom) energy levels are insensitive to n_g fluctuations, but the anharmonicity is reduced The transmon design is similar to the first design of Cooper pair box, both are described by the same Hamiltonian, with the only difference being the increase in the E_{\\\\rm J}/E_{\\\\rm C} ratio, achieved by shunting the Josephson junction with an additional large capacitor. Here E_{\\\\rm J} is the Josephson energy of the junction, and E_{\\\\rm C} is the charging energy inversely proportional to the total capacitance of the qubit circuit. The benefit of increasing the E_{\\\\rm J}/E_{\\\\rm C} ratio is insensitivity to charge noise - the energy levels become independent of electrical charge across the junction, thus the coherence times of the qubit are prolonged. The disadvantage is decrease in the anharmonicity \\\\frac{(E_2-E_1)-(E_1-E_0)}{E_1-E_0}, where E_i is the energy of the state i\\\\rangle. Reduced anharmonicity complicates the device operation as a two level system, e.g. exciting the device from the ground state to the first excited state by a resonant pulse also populates the second excited state. This complication is overcome by complex microwave pulse design, that takes into account the higher energy levels, and prohibits their excitation by destructive interference. Measurement, control and coupling of the transmons is performed by means of microwave resonators with techniques of circuit quantum electrodynamics, also applicable to other superconducting qubits. The coupling to the resonators is done by putting a capacitor between the qubit and the resonator, at a point where the resonator electromagnetic field is biggest. For example, in IBM Quantum Experience devices, the resonators are implemented with \\"quarter wave\\" coplanar waveguide with maximal field at the signal-ground short at the waveguide end, thus every IBM transmon qubit has a long resonator \\"tail\\". The initial proposal included similar transmission line resonators coupled to every transmon, becoming a part of the name. However, charge qubits operated at a similar E_{\\\\rm J}/E_{\\\\rm C} regime, coupled to different kinds of microwave cavities are referred to as transmons as well.

Background The Sultanate of Kedah had been a tributary state to Siam during the Ayutthaya Period, though the extent of Siamese influence over Northern Malay Sultanates varied over time. After the Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Northern Malay Sultanates were freed from Siamese domination temporarily. In 1786, Francis Light managed to obtain a lease of Penang Island from Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah of Kedah on behalf of British East India Company in exchange for British military supports against the Siamese or Burmese. However, in the same year, Siam re-exerted control over Northern Malay Sultanates and sacked Pattani. Francis Light, however, failed to secure the British military assistance against Siam and Kedah came under Siamese suzerainty. The bunga mas was sent triennially to the Bangkok court. During the Burmese Invasion of Phuket in 1809, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II, who was known in Thai sources as \\"Tuanku Pangeran\\" (), contributed a sizable force from Kedah to aid the Siamese against the Burmese. In 1813, King Rama II commanded Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah of Kedah to bring the Sultanate of Perak under Siamese control. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah then sent forces to capture and occupy Perak under the domination of Kedah on behalf of Siam in 1818. This earned Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah a great favor of the Siamese king, who raised the sultan to the rank of Chao Phraya - which was superior to Nakhon Noi the governor of Ligor or Nakhon Si Thammarat who held the rank of Phraya. In 1811, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah came into conflicts with his brother Tunku Bisnu. Tunku Bisnu approached Phraya Nakhon Noi of Ligor and sought Siamese support. Tunku Bisnu was then made the ruler of Setul. In 1820, King Bagyidaw of Burma planned another invasion of Siam, in which the Kedah Sultanate would inevitably become involved. Tunku Mom, a younger brother of the sultan, informed Phraya Nakhon Noi that the sultan of Kedah was forming an alliance with the Burmese against Siam. Lim Hoi, a Phuket-based Chinese merchant caught a Burmese ship bearing a Burmese letter to the Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah. Phraya Nakhon Noi then relayed the information to the Bangkok court. King Rama II ordered the sultan of Kedah to go to Bangkok to explain. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah of Kedah did not go and ceded bunga mas altogether. King Rama II then ordered Phraya Nakhon Noi of Ligor to invade Kedah Sultanate in 1821. Campaigns The Siamese had still been unsure about the intentions of the sultan and Kedah had not aware of Siamese invasion. Phraya Nakhon Noi had already organized a fleet of 7,000 men at Trang and Satun in his preparations against the speculated Burmese invasions. Pretending to launch attack on Mergui and Tenasserim Coast, Phraya Nakhon Noi requested Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin for provisions. When the Kedahan did not arrive to provide supplies, Nakhon Noi headed his fleet towards Alor Setar in November 1821. When Nakhon Noi arrived at Alor Setar, the Kedahan were still unaware of Siamese intention to invade. Paduka Maharaja Sura the Bendahara ceremoniously received the Siamese entourage. Once in the fort, Nakhon Noi ordered his men to attack. Paduka Maharaja Sura the Bendahara was captured and Paduka Seri Raja the Laksamana was killed in battle. However, Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah managed to flee from the city and took refuge on Penang Island, then under British control.http://www.san.beck.org/20-9-Siam,Laos,Cambodia1800-1950.html Villages were torched and homes were looted. A great number of Malays also fled to Penang and Province Wellesley. Aftermath After taking the city, Phraya Nakhon Noi established the Siamese administration over the Kedah State and made his son Phra Pakdiborrirak as the Siamese governor of Kedah. Siam imposed the direct rule through Ligor and installed Siamese personnel in Kedah, thus the sultanate ceased to exist for a time. For his victory over Kedah, King Rama II raised Nakhon Noi to the rank of Chao Phraya and granted his son Phra Pakdiborrirak the title of Phraya Abhaydhibetr. Phraya Abhaydhibetr would govern Kedah on behalf of his father the governor of Ligor for seventeen years from 1821 until 1838. By 1822 there was a rise in the population of the British territories caused by an influx of Malays displaced by the invasion. The Siamese presence in Kedah threatened British holdings in Penang, who speculated the Siamese invasion of the island. This prompted Marquess of Hastings, the Governor-General of India, to send John Crawfurd to Bangkok, leading to the first contact between Siam and the British Empire in the Rattanakosin Period. Crawfurd arrived in Bangkok in April 1822, he presented the personal letter of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah to King Rama II blaming Nakhon Noi \\"the Raja of Ligor\\" for the incidents. The agreements were not reached as Siam asserted her authorities over Kedah and the sultan. Three years later in 1825, Chao Phraya Nakhon Noi prepared a fleet to invade and conquer the sultanates of Perak and Selangor. Robert Fullerton warned the Raja of Ligor that the Siamese invasion of the sultanates would violate the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1824 but the warnings went unheeded. Fullerton then sent gunboats to impose blockade on the Trang River in modern Trang Province where the brigantine fleet of Nakhon Noi was being dispatched and the Siamese expedition was called off. The Burney Treaty was concluded between Siam and British Empire on June 26, 1826. The Burney Treaty allowed the Siamese view of their rights to prevail.Frank Athelstane Swettenham, Map to Illustrate the Siamese Question (1893) p. 62; archive.org. The British accepted Siamese influence over Kedah in exchange for free trade on stocks and provisions between Siam and Prince of Wales Island and Siam's relinquished claims on Selangor. The British also agreed to move Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin to somewhere else. The Article XIII of the treaty stated that: \\"The English engage that they will make arrangements for the former Governor of Queda to go and live in some other Country, and not at Prince of Wales' Island or Prye, or in Perak, Salengore, or any Burmese Country.\\" The former sultan of Kedah was then forcibly moved to Malacca. However, Penang continued to be the center of resistance to Siamese rule. Tengku Kudin, a nephew of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin, captured Alor Setar from the Siamese in 1831, though Chao Phraya Nakhon Noi retook Alor Setar four months later. Another resistance of Kedah came in 1838 when two nephews of Sultan Admah Tajuddin joined with Wan Mali to take Alor Setar. Only after the death of Chao Phraya Nakhon Noi in 1838 that the native Malay rule was restored. Tunku Anom was made the governor of Kedah in 1838 until when Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin pledged for himself to be restored. The Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin, after twenty years of exile, was eventually restored to the Kedah Sultanate in 1842 under Siamese suzerainty.

Being a part of the spectrum known as \\"UHF Bands IV and V\\" (i.e. 470 MHz to 862 MHz) it was allocated by the ITU to Broadcasting as the primary user in Region 1 and was used for analogue television broadcasting before changing to digital terrestrial television in many countries.The 'Mobile Service' in ITU terms, not to be confused with mobile phone operators, was allocated as a secondary user of the band As such it is also referred to as \\"digital dividend\\" spectrum. In Europe and to some extent elsewhere, the band corresponds to UHF channel 61‚Äì69. In most territories the band was also used by Services Ancillary to Broadcasting (SAB) or Services Ancillary to Programme Making (SAP), both often now referred to as PMSE (Programme Making and Special Events) in the form of professional wireless microphones, radio talkback systems and wireless monitor systems. The European Parliament approved May 2010, At Japan on 2012, the change of use of the 800 MHz band making it available for purposes other than broadcasting (television) ‚Äì e.g. mobile broadband.May 14th, 2010, intomobile.com: Europe‚Äôs 800 MHz band = America‚Äôs 700 MHz band; 4G has a long way to go Citat: \\"...Last week the European Commission announced that they‚Äôve chosen 800 MHz as a standard to introduce mobile broadband across the continent...\\" From the year 2013 the 800 MHz band can be used to deliver wireless broadband services, in Europe.16 Feb 2012, techeye.net: EU demands freeing up 800 MHz spectrum by 2013 Quote: \\"...to ensure a comprehensive roll out of high speed mobile broadband...\\"  Possible interference problems  Some claim that there have not been enough interference studies made in the EU.15 November 11, computerworlduk.com: EU rules on radio spectrum ignore interference issues, group claims Quote: \\"...Under the RSPP, all EU countries must make the 800MHz band available for wireless broadband services by January 1, 2013...However, newcomers to the 800MHz band that \\"speaks loudly\\" could drown out other sorts of communications being executed by consumer equipment (such as television tuners or cable modems)...\\" 2 June, 2011, ispreview.co.uk: 760000 UK Households Could Lose Digital TV Due to Superfast Mobile Broadband Quote: \\"...Ofcom warns that some situations could be too difficult or costly to fix and suggests that it may be \\"preferable to maintain the consumers‚Äô access to TV while accepting the loss of the DTT service\\". In other words, you'd (about 30,000 homes) have to fork out for a satellite or cable service...\\" The reason for the interference problem is that the RF chain in TV-equipment is designed to receive 470‚Äì862 MHz (EU channels 21‚Äì69) and therefore includes the range of frequencies which the new services are, or will be, using. Most TV receiving equipment in current use and currently on the market was not designed with the expectation that there would be anything but TV signals in the frequency range 470 MHz to 862 MHz. Due to the very limited guard band between the new services and the existing TV services in some cases the LTE 800 base station signals may cause interference to DTT particularly in EU channels 59 and 60. Strong LTE base station signals in 800 MHz band, may cause limiting or clipping, that is due to overdrive in antenna amplifiers and/or DTT tuners in e.g. flat panels, set top boxes, USB-tuners and digital video recorders. Depending on the dynamic range performance of the affected receiving equipment, the following may happen: * When forward error correction (FEC) is adequate, the TV reception will be unaffected * If the interference is sufficiently severe such that FEC cannot correct all of the errors, there will be pixelation in the picture and/or there will be sound drop-outs. * In severe cases of interference the error correction will not cope at all and this will result in a black TV-screen and / or complete loss of sound. Overload in the RF chain will not only affect one TV channel. All signals passing through the overloaded device will be affected for as long as the device remains overloaded. Essentially there are two types of interference sources in the 800 MHz band: The LTE base stations and the mobile terminals ‚Äî handsets, tablets, dongles ‚Äî which are sometimes close to TV equipment. Although the base stations may be relatively far away from the TV equipment they may be adjacent to the TV antenna, or if further away they may be in the 'beam' of the TV antenna, i.e. in the direction which the TV antenna points, and considerably closer than the TV transmitter which it is desired to receive resulting in a high level of interfering signal in the TV system. In the case of apartments, hotels, schools, colleges, offices, etc. with communal TV antenna systems the base station may be very close indeed, even on the same roof. For the time being there are not many terminals in the European market that use the LTE 800 frequency band but this is increasing rapidly. In the UK an organisation (Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited (DMSL), known as \\"at800\\") was set up specifically to mitigate any interference from the new LTE 800 services to TV reception in the UK.https://at800.tv/find-out-more/about-us/  \\"Channel 70\\" interference  The frequency band between 862 MHz to 870 MHz, or a subset of this band, e.g. 863 MHz to 865 MHz, is sometimes referred to as 'Channel 70'. 862 MHz to 870 MHz is itself divided into many smaller sub-bands used in many territories by vast numbers of a wide range of different low power radio devices, often on a licence exempt basis. For example, 863 MHz to 865 MHz is used in many European countries by cordless audio devices such as some cordless headphones, assistive listening devices (used by the hard of hearing) and some wireless microphones. Any low power radio devices operating in the range 862 MHz to 870 MHz are most likely to be affected by interference from the portable devices using the 800 MHz LTE system since they will be transmitting in the upper part of the 790 MHz to 862 MHz band, i.e. the part of the band which is closest to the frequencies used by Low Power Radio Devices.  868 MHz interference  Systems that use the 868 MHz-band (868‚Äì870 MHz), for example, thermostats, fire systems, burglar systems, and DIN- transceivers may have difficulty communicating when there is a strong 800 MHz broadband transmitter nearby.rfdesignuk.com: LTE 800MHz 4G introduction in Europe and interference to the 868MHz SRD band.

From about 300 to 700 the Manasota culture adopted the ceremonial ceramics and burial practices of the Weeden Island cultures of northern Florida and adjacent Alabama and Georgia. The Manasota culture was defined by archaeologists George Luer and Marion Almy in 1979. Their definition partially replaced an earlier definition of a Perico Island tradition or culture, which failed to hold up under later research. Luer and Almy identify 25 archaeological sites around Tampa Bay and between Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor as belonging to the Manasota culture.Luer and Almy:34‚Äî36 The Manasota culture incorporated ceremonial burial practices of the Weeden Island cultures starting around 300 until 700.Milanich:221 Weeden Island sacred ceramics were first described at the Weedon Island site in Pinellas County.Milanich 1994:8, 156 The Weedon Island site was part of the Weeden Island-related late Manasota culture.

Catharine‚Äôs work extended past her academic research, as she also became an advocate for their rights on issues such as the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline debate in 1976. Her husband was fellow anthropologist John Hitchcock whom she married in 1974; he died in 2001 from natural health complications.Cruikshank, Julie. Obituary. American Anthropologist. 2010 (112:2)  Biography  Catharine was born in York, PA, lived throughout the United States and Yukon Territory throughout the course of her life, and died in Peterborough, New Hampshire. She did extensive work in the Yukon from the 1950s to 1980s, where she conducted a detailed research study using their traditional oral stories as research material to study the Aboriginal peoples in the Yukon. For over 30 years she worked as a scholar and close companion with many northern individuals as they used their traditional stories to instruct and guide her work. Her work became a model for applied anthropology. She was one of the first anthropologists to dedicate research to northern oral tradition, and in doing so, she helped standardize the rules for transcribing oral history.McClellan, Catharine. My Old People‚Äôs Stories: A Legacy for Yukon First Nations. PART 1: Southern Tutchone Narrators. 2007. Catharine‚Äôs attitude towards her Northern research was inherently feminist. At the age of 25 she married cultural ecologist John Hitchcock. Their scholarly partnership began when they worked at the University of Wisconsin, Madison together, though they were not romantically involved until years later.Women Anthropologists: Selected Biographies. \\"Catharine McClellan\\" by Ann Stoler. pp. 246-51.  Education  Catharine graduated from her undergraduate degree in anthropology from Bryn Mawr College in 1942. From there she moved to California to study at the University of California, Berkeley beginning in 1946 where she was supervised by Robert Lowie. In 1950 Catharine received her PhD from American MidWest University in anthropology.York Daily Record. Obituary. 2009.  Fieldwork  Catharine‚Äôs research in the Yukon was characterized by her forerunner interest as an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù documenting their oral tradition. These initial interviews helped to encourage the precise documentation of particular transcripts of narrative accounts which allowed her to begin to identify the nature of differences among these traditional stories. Her research relied on time-intensive work in the North as used oral interviews and many visits to the communities to gain both a proper relationship with her informants, such as Angela Sidney, as well as to act ethically as a participant observer. Her work on the manuscript for My People's Stories began in the 1980s, most were taken down between 1948 and 1952 and appear here as a collection of 175 narratives or cycles of narrative. Thirty-five were told by Southern Tutchone speakers. The Inland Tlingit stories or cycles number sixty-two. Catharine collaborated with Frederica de Laguna in Angoon in 1950 as well as travelling North with her to conduct ethnological investigations at Yakutat in 1952, along with Francis A Riddell. In this ethnological work, the group discovered there were two individuals in the community who were native speakers of the nearly extinct Athabascan language Eyak.de Laguna, Frederica. Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit: Part Three. Catharine's early contribution to documenting oral tradition among the Aboriginal people of the Yukon has opened the region up to study from others. This includes Lynn Echevarria's recent research in Bah√° º√≠ Storytelling. She explores similar stories and myths, though from the perspective of a recently introduced religion. Between 1960-1974, 205 people adopted the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Many of the individuals maintained their oral storytelling traditions, and Echevarria's research ca. 2008 worked to document as much of this history as they could.Echevarria, Lynn. \\"A New Skin for an Old Drum: Changing Contexts of Yukon Aboriginal Baha'i Storytelling.\\" The Northern Review 29 (Fall 2008): 39-62. Echevarria credits the forerunner work done by Catharine and Julie Cruikshank, stating \\"their extensive work with Yukon First nations peoples have done much to show that Aboriginal oral narratives provide types of knowledge different from the western scientific model.\\"  Employment  Catharine was first employed in the U.S. Navy WAVES following graduation from Bryn Mawr for four years until attending University of California, Berkeley. She began working with the University of Washington in 1952 and until 1956 she remained with them while frequently visiting the Yukon as both a friend and scholar. She then held later positions at Barnard College from 1956 to 1961 and then moving to University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1961 to 1983 when she officially retired from professorship. She remained a Professor Emeriti there until her death.*York Daily Record. Obituary. 2009. Her teaching style was unique, and though unstructured, it was comprehensive and multisensory in helping her students understand the way of life in the North. To illustrate important elements of the stories from her research, she would bring in tools, clothes, and weapons from both the Tlingit and Athapaskan peoples for her students. She would also insist her graduate students read Kroeber, Lowie, and de Laguna, as she worked closely with all of them in the prime of their careers. Catharine was also a visiting professor at Bryn Mawr College in 1954, the University of Missouri in 1962, University of Alaska twice in 1973 and again in 1987.

However, A.F.C. Leopards were dissatisfied with the ruling made by the IDCC and opted to drop out of the tournament, but it had been decided that the match would take place on 20 May 2012. Lack of a suitable venue to host the clash led to the match being postponed yet again.

The date for the match was confirmed to be 29 July 2012, with the venue as the Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani.

The latter were consequently fined KSh 500,000, even though they had previously stated that they would not honour the fixture, citing no consultation of an appropriate date with the KPL and financial problems. However, KPL CEO Jack Oguda had stated that Leopards were to be fined KSh 1.5 million, and may have to pay another KSh 3.5 million fine, linked to the incurred expenses that broadcasters SuperSport could forward to the KPL. The Football Kenya Federation, however, suspended the result after, having demanded to be furnished with security measures to be taken for and the rules and regulations governing the tournament, the KPL failed to reply with furnishings. The suspension was lifted on 1 August 2012 after a consultative meeting held between FKF and KPL officials. The FKF also nullified the fine that was imposed on A.F.C.

The issues of equity ownership and control are an important element in defining what is indeed a minority owned media outlet. Minority ownership includes outlets owned by women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian- Americans, or Native Americans. Ownership is often not easily defined as to raise capital for operating expenses or expansion firms that were started as minority owned often include substantial non-minority shareholders.United States: Department of Commerce.(2000).

FCC For many years the FCC's policies to give opportunities, and sometimes even preference, to new minority run stations in underserved areas went unchallenged. In 1983, two companies applied for the same television broadcasting license in the Orlando area. The broadcasting license was initially granted to Metro Broadcasting, Inc., but then the license was reviewed and given to another company, Rainbow Broadcasting because it was under 90% Hispanic-American ownership, therefore meeting the qualifications for being minority owned. This initial granting, and then revoking, the license caused a quick reaction. Metro Broadcasting sued the FCC and case, known as Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, eventually came to the Supreme Court. The charges were that the FCC policy of favoring minorities violated the equal protection clause.Retrieved from http://www.enotes.com/metro-broadcasting-inc- v-federal-communications-reference/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal- communications The Supreme Court ruled that, \\"The FCC policies do not violate equal protection, since they bear the imprimatur of longstanding congressional support and direction and are substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of broadcast diversity Pp. 563-601\\".Cornell University Law School: Legal Information Institute.

This ruling was also significant in that it confirmed the constitutionality of affirmative action policies that promoted diversity rather than simply redressing past discrimination.http://www.enotes.com/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal- communications-reference/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal-communications Even though the Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.

Congressional Support of Minority Ownership Policies: Minority Telecommunications Development Program As part of the U.S. government's efforts to increase the opportunity for minority ownership of media outlets the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has administered a program since the late 1970s known as the Minority Telecommunications Development Program (MTDP). Part of the responsibility of this program, which is run under the U.S. Department of Commerce, is to establish the definition of a minority owned commercial broadcasting unit, monitor the number of active licenses for minority ownership, and how to best facilitate ownership of media outlets.United States: Department of Commerce.(2000).

More media outlets grew in number and major companies, started to consolidate newspaper and television ownership. In the 1980s and early 1990s there was general pressure to reduce government regulation and increase market forces. There was also growing pressure to have the FCC use bandwidth and the licensing of radio, television and other devices as a source of revenue for the people of the United States. In 1993, the U.S. Congress authorized the FCC to grant licenses to auction bandwidth.Hazlett, T. W., Coase, R. H. (1998). \\"Assigning Property Rights to Radio Spectrum Users: Why did FCC License Auctions Take 67 Years?\\" Journal of Law and Economics. 2(2):529-580. The potential monetization of this limited resource by large corporations made it extremely valuable. To be able to compete for bandwidth brought even more pressure for large corporations to try to consolidate. It was obvious that both technology and market forces were changing rapidly. Subsequently, the U.S. Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This required the FCC to review their ownership rules every four years.United States Congress. (1996). \\"Telecommunications Act of 1996.\\" Retrieved from http://www.fcc.gov FCC Major Policy Revisions: Telecommunications Act of 1996 The FCC issued sweeping changes through the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This included major changes to the guidelines that determined who would be eligible for ownership of media outlets. The restrictions of cross ownership were greatly relaxed, which made it even more difficult for minorities to financially compete with the growing conglomerates who were amassing media outlets. The FCC determined \\"that the existing rules were no longer in the public interest, repealed them, and replaced them with a single set of Cross-Media Limits using a methodological tool called the 'Diversity Index'.\\"United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

This would be presuming that all voices represented an equal possible strength, as in a business situation where each producer of a similar commodity has an equal chance of success and all will serve the market equally. Therefore, the FCC evaluated market concentration using a highly modified Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which is used by the U.S. Department of Justice to evaluate proposed mergers and acquisitions to prevent monopolies. However, the FCC added their \\"http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_telecom_and_utilities/000230.html\\" to allow for the obvious inability of the Herfindahl-Hirschman to truly measure market concentration.United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

FCC After the 2002 FCC Biennial Regulatory Review, the FCC continued its movement towards implementing more relaxed ownership standards. A non-profit media advocacy group called Prometheus Radio Project filed suit to block these changes.Prometheus I, 373 F.3d at 382, 421 This case was heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and is commonly known as Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC. The court found that the new policies of the TC Policy Act of 1996 were in violation of both Congress' long-standing mandate to promote diversity in media outlet ownership. The sections that were remanded covered several areas, but the outstanding issues that the court asked the FCC to address primarily concerned ways to ensure access for minority representation in ownership of media outlets. This goal is supported not only by Congressional mandate, but also confirmed by the Supreme Court as an important policy the FCC must consider in their rule revisions.Austin, C. (2011). Overwhelmed by big consolidation: Bringing back regulation to increase diversity in programming that serves minority audiences. Federal Communications Law Journal, 63(3), 733-763. Current Trends That Effect Minority Ownership of Media Outlets =Overall Media Ownership Consolidation= One of the major changes in the guidelines for media ownership is the number of outlets that one entity can own. The original media ownership guidelines were established to encourage competition and diversity. This is to ensure that each community would have the opportunity to have different voices owning media outlets. Media producers proposed that by consolidated ownership they could produce better quality programming at a lower price. These business owners ask that the FCC relax their ownership rules.United States. General Accounting Office. (2008). GAO-08-383, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Retrieved from http://www.gao.gov/assets/280/273682.pdf There are many economic arguments for allowing media outlets to consolidate. Through shared resources one company can produce news and information for television, radio, and newspapers, this reduces production costs and allows the company to invest in better production facilities and improve the quality of their broadcasting. Some proponents of media consolidation also claim that viewers \\"vote\\" by choosing to watch a station and that is why it grows in market power. If a station grows in market power it can in turn command more advertising revenue and then eventually acquire other media outlets.Jenkins, H. (2004). The Cultural Logic of Media Convergence. International Journal of Cultural Studies. Vol. 7(1):33-43 DOI: 10.1177/1367877904040603 Many of the FCC rules and regulations were originally designed to encourage competition and prevent a high concentration of ownership. However, with the relaxation of these rules there has been a fundamental change in the balance of media ownership. \\"Regardless of the methods used, research documents increasing consolidation across all areas that make up the media industries, with many industries reaching \\"highly concentrated\\" status, indicating that the industry is dominated by a handful of firms.\\"Downing, J.

Markets that are ethnically diverse often have outlets that operate in different languages. However, true diversity in markets is not always easy to measure. Smaller outlets often have agreements where they share content or staff to reduce costs.United States. General Accounting Office. (2008). GAO-08-383, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Retrieved from http://www.gao.gov/assets/280/273682.pdf Because of these operating agreements it is very hard to measure how many media outlets are producing independent and local news. Some of these sharing agreements are intended to simplify management or share resources that would otherwise be duplicated and allow the media outlets to remain competitive and financially sustainable. However, in December 2011 the FCC was reexamining sharing agreements because of the potential to limit localism and diversity in reporting and reduce choices for the consumer.Jessell, H. A.

Since the 1996 Telecommunications Act many media outlets have been purchased by large corporations, driving up the prices of outlets. This raises barriers for entry into the market for small or new entities.U.S. House of Representatives. Committee on the Judiciary. (July 9, 2009). Trends Affecting Minority Broadcasting Ownership., pg 37-38 http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/printers/111th/111-24_50863.PDF To help overcome these hurdles and achieve the objective of having more minority-owned outlets the government has started several initiatives. These initiatives include facilitating sale of \\"distress sale\\" licenses to minority owned firms and encouraging banks to utilize Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loan programs as well as making it easier for larger companies to sell to a minority firm a cluster of stations, \\"grandfathered\\" licenses bought before the FCC broadcast ownership rules were changed.Laser, M.

When elected in 2000 she was the first woman to hold that post.Soon after her election it was announced that Menezes and Ines Cotta Carvalho, Secretary General of the AICU, were planning to visit Kuwait, Bahrain, the U.A.E. and Oman in October 2000 to raise support for AICU activities. During her tenure the Union grew rapidly. She was an energetic fundraiser, determined to establish a Corpus Fund of one Crore rupees so the AICU would be able to support the Church and related organizations rather than asking them for support. Following the 2002 Gujarat violence, Menezes and AICU vice-president John Dayal issued a statement in September 2002 voicing profound concern at events in the state. They said Chief Minister Narendra Modi and his rivals were involved in \\"an aggressive misuse of religious sentiments in their political campaigns\\". The statement said Modi and the Sangh Parivar were dismissing the pain of the survivors of the violence and raising fresh fears among minorities. Menezes was unanimously re-elected in September 2002. In her speech after reelection Menezes said the AICU would continue to stress growth of community leadership, and would look for increased participation from Dalits, women and young people. She said the AICU would focus on restoring the rights of Christians of Dalit origin, working at the state and national levels. Speaking at the 49th Annual General Meeting of the Union in Chennai on 6 September 2003, Menezes said the AICU must reshape itself to better deal with \\"present political trends and turmoil within the Church\\". She said \\"It must harvest ideas and bring renewal in the Church and country\\". She said that \\"Proper formation of the laity for the distinctive role in the life and ministry of the Church must continue to be a priority\\". Christians in India were in a somber mood in December 2008 after the anti- Christian violence in Orissa earlier that year and the Mumbai attacks on 26 November 2008. As past president of the AICU, Menezes said \\"Christmas is going to be as always. But the manner of celebrations should be different. In solidarity with their suffering brethren in Orissa, the Catholic community should suppress festivities and instead concentrate on the spiritual aspects of Christmas\\". She called on parishes throughout India to use the money they would have spent on Christmas to help their fellow-Christians who were suffering in Orissa. She said the response had been generally good, but not in Goa.

Expecting it to announce her father's arrival, Tessa is shocked to find it contains news of his death after a fall from a horse. Unbeknown to Tessa her father had been chased by soldiers, wounded and finally killed by a rifle shot by Captain Grisham. Tessa decides it is time to go home to California. Arriving by ship, Tessa, Marta, and their luggage are being transported by carriage and wagon inland to the Alvarado Hacienda. When they stop to assist a broken-down wagon, they are set upon at gunpoint by masked robbers. Tessa recognizes the voice of the main robber as her father's manservant, Carlos, and when she confronts him, he takes off his mask, confessing his family is starving. Tessa, seeing his desperation, gives him some money. A shot rings out and Carlos is wounded in the arm as Captain Grisham and his men ride up. Grisham introduces himself and returns the money to Tessa, offering to escort her and Marta to the Alvarado Hacienda while his men take Carlos to town. When they arrive at the Hacienda, they find it is in disrepair, and Captain Grisham points out that when her father died, there was no money to pay the workers and that back taxes are owed to Colonel Montoya, but the colonel would loan her the house for a few days and they are invited to a party the colonel is holding that evening. Tessa and Marta go to Santa Helena and find Carlos in the town square tied to a post while his wife, Rubina, tries forlornly to give him some water, but a soldier is preventing this until Tessa intervenes. She promises to speak to Colonel Montoya about her husband. Entering the rose garden, Tessa and Marta find Montoya entertaining the Dons and their wives by playing the violin. Don Hidalgo is present with his young wife and recognizes Tessa but before they can speak Montoya interrupts and asks Tessa to dance. Seeing an opportunity to plead Carlos's case, but to no avail, and as a group of Flamenco dancers begin their routine, Tessa hears a commotion in the square and goes outside to find Carlos is about to be shot by a firing squad headed by Captain Grisham. At the climax to the dance, Carlos is killed. Tessa learns that execution is not murder when it is the law and Montoya is the law. Later that night and back at her hacienda, an angry Tessa is shadow fencing determined to send a message back to Spain, but Marta points out that Spain is still recovering from the wounds of Napoleon and would not be interested. Marta has also learned that Tessa's father had been murdered. At the same time, Colonel Montoya visits Captain Grisham, who is in bed with unfaithful Vera, his lover. Montoya, concerned about Tessa, wants to ensure control of her land by having Grisham propose marriage. Grisham cannot refuse as Montoya can blackmail him with information about his past. The next morning. Tessa visits Rubina and her teenage son, who holds Tessa responsible for his father's death much to Rubina's disgust. Rubina refuses to answer questions about Tessa's father but when given some money for the children, she tells Tessa to ask the Dons. Visiting Don Hidalgo, he is not forthcoming and advises her patronizingly to go home, find a husband, and find fulfillment in marriage. Interrupted by one of Grisham's soldiers with an invitation to lunch at a beach with Grisham. At the beach Grisham, talks about marriage. But Tessa only wants to talk about her father's murder yet he insists it was an accident. Tessa asks Grisham to take her back to town. As they arrive back in town, Rubina's son has been arrested, accused of theft by a shopkeeper. But Tessa said she gave the family some money. The boy spits at Captain Grisham, who is incensed. But Tessa asks for mercy and Grisham agrees that the boy will not be executed, but given 50 lashes the next morning. That night, while Tessa sleeps Marta reads some tarot cards, which mirror a dream that Tessa is having about her father, who speaks to her about his wine (referring to it as liquid gold) and his murder. But she should do nothing because his \\"avenging angel\\" will see justice done. Waking, she goes to Marta, who already knows what has happened. Going to their cellar, they find the wine in the dream and the bottle in the rack is a handle to a secret door into a concealed room. Within, they find Don Alvarado's hidden valuables including gold and a sword, a rapier in the family for generations, for the son he never had. There is also a portrait of Tessa as a seven-year-old titled \\"Tessa my Angel.\\" Looking in a mirror with the tarot card of the Queen of Swords, Marta asks what she sees, and Tessa replies ‚ÄùMy destiny!‚Äù Further into the night, Tessa dressed as the Queen of Swords goes to the jail in Santa Helena and, by surprise, overpowers two guards and frees the boy. Her own exit is obstructed by Grisham standing in the doorway with his sword, prepared to kill, and she would be the first woman he has killed. A sword fight ensues with much toing and froing and the Queen retreats into the narrow cell corridor where she is at a disadvantage against a stronger opponent. Grisham gets in close forcing the Queen against the bars believing he has the upper hand but the Queen has maneuvered her sword between his legs. Gaining the advantage, the Queen escapes leaving a calling card from the tarot, the Queen of Swords. Pleased, Tessa goes into town in the morning to find Don Hidago and Montoya discussing the night's events and Hidalgo points out how clever the Colonel is, as the boy went home to his mother and the colonel had men waiting for him and now he will be hung. In Montoya's office, he is surprised when Tessa pays her back taxes but offers her a front row seat at the hanging. But as she leaves his office, she meets Marta and pretends illness so they can be left alone in his office. As the boy is led to the scaffold, Montoya makes a speech from the balcony to the townsfolk when the Queen appears on the church roof and in the ensuing mayhem, to the cheers of the townsfolk, frees the boy once more, then takes him out into the desert warning him not to go home. A furious and thwarted Montoya returns to his office to find Marta tending to a feigning Tessa lying under a cover, and asks her impatiently to get dressed and leave. Tessa goes to her father's grave asking him for guidance when Marta tells her the people are praying for the Queen to return.

Oserian (Masai, \\"Place of Peace\\"; locally, The Gin Palace; later, Djinn Palace) is a flower farm on the south shores of Lake Naivasha, Nakuru County, Kenya. It is Africa's largest rose producer. Oserian's wildlife corridor is more than in width through its property with reaches to the lake; it occupies more than of shoreline. History Originally a country estate, the Moorish-style mansion was built in 1927 by Major Cyril Ramsay-Hill, a rancher, former officer in an Indian regiment, and sometime Hollywood actor. It was based on his grandmother's home in Seville, Spain. The crenellated and domed building features minarets, and contains an \\"inner courtyard, fountains, squash court, swimming pool, and polo grounds\\". During the colonial era, \\"The Djinn Palace\\" was \\"where things usually were very lively\\" for the Happy Valley set, according to Ulf Aschan. It was built for Ramsay-Hill's wife, Molly (n√©e Edith Mildred Maude; 1893‚Äì1939), who had an affair with and later married Josslyn Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll. In 1969, Oserian was established as a small vegetable growing farm. In 1982, it became the first flower farm on Lake Naivasha. Tax avoidance In 2020 it was reported that Dutch firms who were growing cut flowers in Kenya using addresses in Amsterdam to avoid tax on large turnovers. Prof. Attiya Waris who had studied this industry noted they are using Kenyan land but they are avoiding paying for it. Investigators (Investico) had found by using Kenyan data and the Panama Papers that companies like Oserian were avoiding tax. Oserian was using trusts in Liechtenstein and the British Virgin Islands in 2011 to avoid nearly all tax in Kenya despite a 47m Euro turnover.

The term is associated with the Roman Catholic tradition of just war theory, and is found in the writings of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. Depending on the author and the context, the term is used to convey various meanings in theology and politics. These meanings include the divine order imposed on the universe and a theoretical framework for peace. Tranquillitas ordinis remains a cornerstone of Catholic teaching on peace. It is included in the framework laid out by Pope John XXIII in his 1963 encyclical, Pacem in terris, and is a featured topic at The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis, a conference organized by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.  The Augustinian tradition  Augustine of Hippo defines the term \\"Tranquillitas Ordinis\\" in Book 19 of the City of God as \\"the peace of all things\\" or \\"well-ordered concord\\".\\"Peace between man and God is the well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law. Peace between man and man is well-ordered concord. Civil peace is a similar concord among the citizens. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God. The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is the distribution which allots things equal and unequal, each to its own place.\\" Augustine links peace with his meaning of order, in which all things in the universe have their proper place established by God, their creator. Peace is therefore the state a person or thing achieves when it is in accordance with the larger created order. In Book 19, Augustine describes the supreme good and discusses efforts people take in order to reach happiness on earth.\\"Augustine reviews the opinions of the philosophers regarding the supreme good, and their vain efforts to make for themselves a happiness in this life; and, while he refutes these, he takes occasion to show what the peace and happiness belonging to the heavenly city, or the people of Christ, are both now and hereafter.\\" While Augustine denies the possibility of achieving tranquillitas ordinis on earth, he notes that aspects of the peace and happiness of heaven may still be found. Centuries later, Thomas Aquinas continued the tradition of true peace as tranquillitas ordinis in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas built upon the work of Augustine and formalized a theory of just war in which the Augustinian root idea of peace as tranquillitas ordinis is linked to the just war tradition. In the Summa Theologica, Aquinas describes the theory of just war as comprising a jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Jus ad bellum articulates the circumstances under which war may be pursued, while jus in bello describes correct conduct in war. George Weigel George Weigel is a prominent Catholic political and social author who serves as a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. In his book Tranquillitas Ordinis: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace, published in 1987, Weigel defines tranquillitas ordinis as the peace of \\"dynamic and rightly ordered political community\\" and \\"the order created by just political community and mediated through law\\". Weigel also argued that tranquillitas ordinis provided a basis for the establishment of peace as a \\"jus ad pacem\\" to accompany the just war theory terms jus ad bellum and jus in bello, that is, a guide to achieving peace through political means, including war.\\"There I argued that, as a theory of statecraft, the just war tradition contained within itself a ius ad pacem, in addition to the classic ius ad bellum (the moral rules governing the decision to go to war) and ius in bello (the rules governing the use of armed force in combat). By coining the phrase ius ad pacem, I was trying to prise out of the just war way of thinking a concept of the peace that could and should be sought through the instruments of politics‚Äîincluding, if necessary, the use of armed force. Like the just war tradition itself, this concept of peace finds its roots in Augustine: in The City of God, peace is tranquillitas ordinis, the ‚Äútranquillity of order,‚Äù or as I preferred to render it in more contemporary terms, the peace of ‚Äúdynamic and rightly ordered political community.‚Äù Weigel expands on this concept to insist that the U.S. has a moral obligation under the criteria of tranquilitas ordinis to rid the world of terrorist organizations and prevent rogue regimes from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.

Steury was born in Berne, Indiana to David and Mary Habegger Steury. In 1948, while attending a church service in his hometown, Steury became a Christian. Though he didn't know it at the time, that decision set his life on a course that would lead him far from the rural Indiana life he'd known. Steury's first step outside Indiana took him to Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky. He graduated from Asbury in 1953 and the following year married Jennie Sue Groce. Steury obtained a medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1957 and began an internship in tropical medicine at Gorgas Hospital, Panama. In 1956, while still a medical student, Steury signed on with World Gospel Mission and in 1959 was sent to the organization's mission station at Tenwek, Kenya. Begun in 1935 as an aide station, the Tenwek facility had grown into a medical dispensary and clinic, but Steury was the station's first physician. With Steury's leadership, the clinic developed into one of Kenya's largest missionary hospitals with outlying clinics that brought healthcare to the surrounding community. The facility attained a global reputation for its work. Steury died at Avon Park, Florida, in 2002.

It was formally allocated to amateurs at the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12). The band is available on a secondary basis in all ITU regions with the limitation that amateur stations have maximum radiated power of 1 watt effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP); however, stations more than 800 km from certain countries may be permitted to use 5 watts EIRP. The new WRC-12 allocation did not take formal effect until 1 January 2013. However, several countries had already allocated the WRC-12 band to amateurs domestically. Previously, several other countries authorized temporary allocations or experimental operations on nearby frequencies. The band is in the Medium Frequency (MF) region, within the 415‚Äì526.5 kHz maritime band.  History  With maritime traffic largely displaced from 500 kHz band, some countries had taken steps prior to 2012 to allocate frequencies at or near 500 kHz to amateur radio use. During the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) of the International Telecommunication Union, a 15 kHz allocation to the amateur radio service was considered on a secondary use basis. The frequencies studied were between 415 kHz and 526.5 kHz. The result was that 472‚Äì479 kHz was identified as agreeable for all three ITU Regions, except for some countries such as Russia, China, and some Arab states. WRC-12 re- allocated the original 500 kHz frequency back to exclusive maritime mobile use for new navigation systems. On 14 February 2012, the delegates at WRC-12 formally approved allocating 472‚Äì479 kHz to the amateur radio service; however, this new allocation will not take effect until it is entered into the ITU's Radio Regulations. Following that, individual regulatory authorities need to implement the change nationally in order to make the allocation available to radio amateurs under their jurisdiction. Recently amateurs have experimented with weak-signal radio communication near 474.2 kHz, utilising WSPR.  Countries in which operation is permitted  Regions with an amateur radio allocation near 500 kHz. Blue indicates official allocations based on WRC-12. Light blue indicates official allocations that are outside the WRC-12 frequencies. Green indicates experimental allocations. Operation is prohibited in red regions. = Countries with a known band allocation = In Argentina, amateurs have an allocation of 472‚Äì479 kHz. In Australia amateurs now have an allocation from 472‚Äì479 kHz, known as the 630 metre band. The maximum EIRP is 5 watts. In Belgium, on 14 August 2013, a new allocation of 472‚Äì479 kHz has been added to the existing allocation of 501‚Äì504 kHz for ham radio operators holding a HAREC-class license. The maximum EIRP is 5 watts. All modes are permitted. In Brazil, amateurs received privileges as secondary users on 472‚Äì479 kHz in August 2018. In Canada, amateurs have a secondary allocation from 472‚Äì479 kHz beginning 1 April 2014 where they may not exceed 5 W, or 1 W EIRP in some locations. In France (including the French Overseas Departments and Territories) amateurs have access to 472‚Äì479 kHz, with 1 watt EIRP. Germany allocated the frequencies to amateur radio based on the WRC-12 conference, effective 13 June 2012. In New Zealand, the band 472‚Äì479 kHz was allocated to amateur radio, on a secondary basis, with an effective date of 20 December 2012. Amateur transmissions are limited to 25 watts EIRP. In Norway, including Svalbard, Jan Mayen, and the Bouvet Island, amateurs have an allocation of 472‚Äì479 kHz on a secondary basis. Maximum output power is 100 watts, and maximum EIRP of 1 Watt. The Philippines allocated 472‚Äì479 kHz to amateur radio, with an effective date of 30 August 2012. In Poland, amateurs have an allocation from 472‚Äì479 kHz since 18 February 2014. The maximum EIRP is 1 watt. The Principality of Monaco allocated 472‚Äì479 kHz to the amateur service on 18 May 2012. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission approved allocating 472‚Äì479 kHz on a secondary basis to the amateur service, in a report and order released on 29 March 2017. Amateurs wishing to operate on the band will need to notify the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and be separated at least 1 km from electric transmission lines that carry Power line Communication (PLC) signals that use the same band. The maximum EIRP is 5 watts with the transmitter output power not exceeding 500 Watts PEP. CW, RTTY, data, phone, and image emissions are allowed. The first US amateur stations activated the band on Friday 13 October 2017. In The Netherlands, amateurs have an allocation from 472‚Äì479 kHz. Restriction in this is that no contests are allowed, and only the modes A1A, F1A, G1A, and J2A are allowed. The allocation is secondary, and a max. power rating of 100 watts PEP is allowed. As of December 2012, amateurs in some other countries continue to operate on their pre-WRC-12 permits on other frequencies. = Allocations before WRC-12 = In Belgium, amateurs were allocated 501‚Äì504 kHz on a secondary basis on 15 January 2008. Only CW may be used with a maximum ERP of 5 W. On 14 August 2013, an additional allocation for 472‚Äì479 kHz has been added allowing all modes of transmission. In Norway, the band 493‚Äì510 kHz was allocated to radio amateurs on 6 November 2009. Only radiotelegraphy is permitted. After WRC-12, this allocation was replaced with an allocation of 472‚Äì479 kHz. In New Zealand, the 505‚Äì515 kHz band was allocated to amateur radio temporarily, \\"pending an international frequency allocation\\", on 1 March 2010. Amateur use is on a non-interference basis, and transmissions are limited to 25 Watts EIRP, with a bandwidth not exceeding 200 Hz. Now that an international frequency allocation has been made by the ITU and subsequently implemented in New Zealand, this temporary band is being phased out. A transition period of one year was given for amateurs to move to the new allocation. Use of this band will not be permitted after 31 December 2013. In the Netherlands 501‚Äì505 kHz was allocated to Amateur Radio operators, with a maximum of 100 Watts PEP, on 1 January 2012. = Countries with past or current experimental operation = Other regions have granted experimental uses for selected licensees in advance of any international frequency allocation. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the American Radio Relay League an experimental license to explore such uses in September 2006. Eleven years later, the US FCC granted access to all amateurs with a general (or higher) license, effective 13 October 2017. Subsequently, the UK started to issue Special Research Permits for amateurs to use 501‚Äì504 kHz. Ireland has allowed individuals to apply for Test Licenses in the 501‚Äì504 kHz frequency range. Canada has allowed individuals to apply for use in the 504‚Äì509 kHz frequency range. Other regions with experimental operations include Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Spain, and Slovenia.

The origin of the house was as an outstation for Chepstow Castle. In the 18th century, much of the medieval manor was pulled down and replaced. Further additions and alterations were made in the 19th and 20th centuries, including work by Guy Dawber. From the 18th until the mid-20th century, the court was the home of the Curre family, major landowners, who purchased the estate in 1749. It is a Grade II* listed building. History The original medieval manor was a fortified outstation for Chepstow Castle. The gate house, of a 14th-century date is all that remains of the earlier building. In 1749, the court and estate were purchased by the Curre family. The Curres pulled down the remainder of the house, with the exception of a recently constructed wing in the William and Mary style, and built an almost entirely new house in the current Queen Anne style. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sir Guy Dawber, an architect noted for his Arts and Crafts work in the Cotswolds was employed to undertake significant renovations and rebuilding. His work included a \\"very grand\\" billiard room and a long gallery. The house remained the home of the Curres until the death of the last Lady Curre in 1956. It was then sold and was subsequently divided into apartments. Architecture and description The building history of the house is \\"extremely complex.\\" The remnants of the medieval gate tower are mixed with late nineteenth century reconstructions. The architectural historian John Newman considers the East front to be \\"one of the most distinguished in the county.\\" The house is broadly rectangular, with two storeys and seven bays. The interiors are almost unchanged from their late 19th century designs. The house is a Grade II* listed building, recognising its important historical development and its \\"fine interiors.\\" The park and gardens surrounding the house are also recorded, as important survivals with landscaping features from the 17th to the 19th centuries.

The Athenaeum in Princess Street Manchester, England, now part of Manchester Art Gallery, was originally a club built for the Manchester Athenaeum, a society for the \\"advancement and diffusion of knowledge\\", in 1837. The society, founded in 1835, met in the adjacent Royal Manchester Institution until funds had been raised for the building. The society survived financial difficulties to become the centre for Manchester's literary life. It ceased operations in 1938. Sir Charles Barry designed the Athenaeum building in the Italian palazzo style, the first such building in the city. Manchester Corporation acquired the building in 1938. In 2002, Manchester Art Gallery was extended by Hopkins Architects following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions to take in the Athenaeum. It is linked to the art gallery by a glass atrium. The Athenaeum is a grade II* listed building. Society The Manchester Athenaeum for the Advancement and Diffusion of Knowledge was founded in 1835, with James Heywood as its first president. It met initially at the Royal Manchester Institution until funds had been raised for its own building, which was completed in 1837. Their new premises had a newsroom on the ground floor, and a library, lecture hall and coffee room. A billiards room and gymnasium were added later. Richard Cobden was instrumental in promoting education in the city and spoke at the opening. He, along with a significant number of other members of the Anti-Corn Law League's Council, was an important figure in both instigating and developing the society during its early years. He described it as a \\"manufactory for working up the raw intelligence of the town\\". By 1838, there were over 1,000 members, each paying an annual subscription of 30 shillings. The club then hit upon and survived financial difficulties to become the centre for Manchester's literary life. A report about the society in the Sheffield Times in 1847 noted that it catered for the \\"mental and moral improvement\\" of the intelligent among the middle-classes and that the shared pursuit of \\"rational amusement\\" was an aid to bridging the social gap between masters and men. That report, and thus the society, directly inspired two societies with similar goals in Sheffield, confusingly both calling themselves the Sheffield Athenaeum. The society was promoted as \\"an institution for the benefit of the tradesmen, commercial assistants and apprentices, professional students, clerks, of this very populous and flourishing town\\". It also emphasised its admission of women, although in practice until 1844 they had limited membership rights, being barred from full engagement in its activities and from its management. Charles Dickens and Benjamin Disraeli addressed its membership in the 1840s. Manchester Corporation acquired the building in 1938, when the society ceased operations. Architecture Sir Charles Barry, who designed the Royal Manchester Institution in the Greek Revival style, designed the Athenaeum in the Italian palazzo style, the first such building in the city. The building is constructed of sandstone ashlar under a slate roof on a rectangular plan and originally had two storeys and a basement. It has a symmetrical nine-window facade with raised rusticated quoins at the corners and an inscribed frieze under a prominent mutuled cornice. The inscriptions on the frieze are, \\"INSTUTVTED MDCCCXXXV ATHENAEUM ERECTED MDCCCXXXVIII\\" and \\"FOR THE ADVANCEMENT AND DIFFVSION OF KNOWLEDGE\\". The building's interior was damaged by fire in 1874 and was remodelled and an attic floor was added behind a high balustraded parapet with four tall chimneys. A central entrance porch with a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling is accessed by a flight of stone steps and has Doric columns supporting a frieze, moulded cornice and balustraded parapet. The first and second floors have tall two-light casement windows with architraves, balustrades and pediments to the second floor.

He is director to the Institute for Neurophysiology and a university professor at the University of Cologne. Prof. Hescheler is one of the most eminent and the most productive stem cell researchers worldwide, averaging more than 1000 citations of his publications per year. Hescheler has been working with embryonic stem cells since the late 80‚Äôs. He became the first researcher to accomplish an electrophysiological characterisation of stem cells and was also among the first scientists in Germany obtaining permission to do research on human embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, he is founder and chairman to the German Society for Stem Cell Research (GSZ).  Career  Prof. Hescheler obtained his doctoral degree from Saarland University in 1985 and continued his research on Ca2+ currents until his Habilitation in the year 1988. He was offered C4 Professorship positions at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and University of T√ºbingen in 1993. He was appointed Director of the Institute for Neurophysiology at the University of Cologne in 1994. His subsequent accomplishments include the position of a Visiting Professor at University of Vermont (USA, 1992), at Tongji Medical University, in Wuhan (China, 1998), President of confidents of the German National Academic Foundation (2000), University of Texas, Houston (USA, 2001), University of Xian (China, 2003), Founder and President of the German Society for Stem Cell Research (2004). He has been appointed as the Coordinator of various pan-European consortia including the large-scale integrated EU-projects FunGenES (\\"Functional Genomics of Engineered Embryonic Stem Cells), CRYSTAL (\\"Cryo-banking of stem cells for human Therapeutic Application\\"), ESNATS (\\"Embryonic stem cell-based Novel Alternative Testing Strategies\\"), and DETECTIVE - Detection of endpoints and biomarkers for repeated dose toxicity using in vitro systems. In 2009 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Dr. h.c. by the Tongji Medical University Wuhan, China. Hescheler has been working with embryonic stem cells ever since the late 1980s. Beginning with studies on cellular signal transduction, and starting with works on signalling pathways in different cells (g-protein phosphorylation, electrophysiology of channels) he focussed on embryonic stem cells and has since defined many important basic aspects of both fundamental research and clinical applications. He was the first scientist worldwide to perform electrophysiological and functional experiments on stem cells and differentiated phenotypes thereof. He achieved a first functional characterization of cardiomyocytes developed from embryonic stem cells which is an important prerequisite for their subsequent use in regenerative medicine. He thus pioneered the establishment of stem cell research for application in transplantation medicine. In 2002, he was among the first scientists in Germany to obtain permission to work with human embryonic stem cells. In his current position, as Chairman and Director to the Institute for Neurophysiology at the University of Cologne, his research areas include work on embryonic and adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and germline pluripotent stem cells. Among progressing the use of stem cells for translational purposes, aiming at tapping the potential of stem cell biology towards clinical application, Hescheler actively promotes the vision of EPAA through innovative alternative testing strategies, applying stem cells towards toxicity testing. Apart from the rationale of promoting 3R principles it is his goal that coordinating a multidisciplinary research effort undertaken by various projects and consortia led by Hescheler will generate pathway- and evidence-based understanding of long-term toxic effects, thus moving toxicology from a rather descriptive science towards a more mechanistic-driven predictive one. Hescheler has been appointed coordinator of various European Consortia such as FunGenES, CRYSTAL, and more recently ESNATS and DETECTIVE. He is also coordinator of the BMBF consortium ‚ÄúiPS and adult bone marrow cells for cardiac repair‚Äù. In 2004 he founded and since chaired the German Society of Stem Cell Research (GSZ). He is an active member of the Scientific Panel of the AXLR8 Consortium and a member of steering committee of Stem Cell Network North Rhine Westphalia.

Alliances and factions evolve throughout the series; the following list is divided into groups as they are at the beginning of the war. Main characters =Todd Hewitt= Todd Hewitt is the protagonist of the series. When the trilogy begins, he is one month shy of turning thirteen. (Note that New World follows a thirteen-month calendar, meaning he is actually about fourteen Earth/Old World years at the beginning of the series.) Brought up by his adoptive parents, Ben and Cillian, Todd was kept unaware of Prentisstown‚Äôs history until the end of the first book. Mayor Prentiss prevented Todd from gaining an education, and consequently, Todd‚Äôs narrative is illiterate and unrestricted. He cannot read or write, a problem that has prevented him from reading his mother‚Äôs diary and communicating with Viola from the scout ship in book three. His voice has been described as \\"science fiction's Huckleberry Finn.\\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by- topic/authors/profiles/article/43857-in-praise-of-chaos-.html In The Ask and the Answer, Todd is forced to follow the Mayor's commands in his militaristic regime, The Ask. He first commits acts of cruelty against Spackle, but later on the Mayor enforces the same acts on women. This raises questions about the justification of actions when the perpetrator is 'following orders'. Without Viola, he starts to become colder and emotionally detached from the dire situation. He is at first forced to do so because Viola is under the Mayor‚Äôs control, but as the novel progresses, Todd starts to lose who he really is. It is only until Mayor Prentiss reveals his plans that Todd sees he must fight him to save Viola, and New Prentisstown. Throughout the novels, Todd is repeatedly pressured to murder another human being in order to fulfil Mayor Prentiss‚Äô plans. However, his character is labelled unable to kill, until the end of The Ask and The Answer, where his noise reveals that he would kill for Viola. This then leads him to participate in war, and he has since killed many Spackle in self-defence, though has not killed any men. In Monsters of Men, Todd‚Äôs character encounters further challenges. When spending time with the Mayor, the two develop a link (denoted by a small humming in their Noise). Todd gains control over his Noise, thus allowing him to silence it, use it as a weapon, learn with it, and use it to control other people. However, in the end it is revealed that by silencing one‚Äôs Noise, the attack power of the Noise is decreased. Todd ends up trusting the Mayor again, and saves him unconsciously from death several times. However, when Ben shows up, Todd's bond with the Mayor breaks. The skills taught to him ultimately allow Todd to defeat the Mayor in a battle using only his Noise. The Sky, 1017, mortally wounds Todd near the end of Monsters of Men, mistaking Todd for the Mayor, though he admits that he wasn‚Äôt sure when he fired his weapon. Todd‚Äôs Noise leaves, returning in small bursts, and he remains in a coma-like state at the end of book three. However, the final chapter hints that he will wake so long as Viola keeps ‚Äòcalling‚Äô him. A short story released in May 2013 reveals that Todd has awoken from his coma, but no further details have been provided. =Viola Eade= Viola Eade had recently turned thirteen (twelve-month calendar) when she crash-landed on New World with her parents. She was the sole survivor of the crash; her father perished in the fire that caused the crash, while her mother lived for only a few moments following it. She and her family were part of a scouting party sent ahead by a group of new settlers. Her mother was the best pilot on the ship while her father was a skilled engineer of their settlers' spacecraft, the Delta.http://www.booktrust.org.uk/usr/library/documents/short- stories/the_new_world.pdf Her looks are not described explicitly in the novels, the only description being that her hair is short and that her skin is pale. Later on in the 1st book, Viola is described as being smaller than Todd. She was one of the top students on the Delta (out of all the caretaker families' children) and was taught how to survive on the new planet. She saves both of their lives by using a campfire box to set off an explosion, destroying a bridge just before the Mayor's men had caught up to her and Todd. She is introduced in The Knife of Never Letting Go when Todd 'hears' her silence, as she has no Noise. She is the first female he has seen (excluding the women he saw when he was young, which he can't remember). At the beginning, she is still in shock from the crash and the loss of her parents; she doesn't speak to Todd, and, combined with her lack of Noise, this causes him to wonder whether she feels any emotions at all. After Todd helps her escape from Aaron, she tells Todd her name. They begin to cooperate with each other as she shares items from her bag with him to assist them on their journey. She travelled with Todd to Haven in hopes of finding a communication tower, intent on sending a message back to the settlers‚Äô main ship. She was disappointed to learn that New World lacks this technology, and is later averted from this goal by Mayor Prentiss. In The Ask and the Answer, she becomes a POV character along with Todd. The two are separated as Todd is under the Mayor's control, while she is sent to the house of healing. There she meets Mistress Coyle, a fearsome and calculating healer who is also the leader of a resistance army against the Mayor's group. As Viola becomes further entrenched into the workings of The Answer, she learns how to heal, set off bombs, and how to negotiate in war. In the final book, she comes close to death, infected by the virus Mayor Prentiss placed in all the metal bands. She also meets Bradley, her teacher and friend from her ship, when he and Simone land on New World for a scouting mission. Viola starts the Spackle war for Todd by launching a missile from the scout ship, and realizes that she will kill for Todd, noting that it is a dangerous thing. She and Todd finally kiss towards the end of the novel. Relatives and Allies =Ben Moore= Ben is Todd's adoptive father who was a friend of his mother's. He and Cillian raised Todd and helped him escape when he discovered that it was possible to escape the Noise. He later rejoined him and told him and Viola the truth about Prentisstown, how the men killed all the women because they couldn't read their thoughts. When they were found by Mayor Prentiss's men, Ben was seemingly killed by Davy Prentiss Jr. He was revealed to be alive in Monsters of Men and was essential in redeeming the Return from his lust for revenge. Ben was changed from his resurrection and could speak the Spackle language which led him to prefer to speak through his Noise. His return to Todd was the straw that broke the filial bond that the latter had formed with the Mayor and helped bring his Noise back, healing his broken relationship with Viola. Ben, along with Viola and Bradley, negotiated peace with the new Sky when the Mayor ordered his remaining troops to destroy the Answer. Ben is the origin of the phrase \\"War makes monsters out of men\\" which was taken up several times in the trilogy and was the title base of the third book. It is implied that Ben and Cillian were more than friends when 1017/The Return/The Sky refers to Cillian as Ben's 'One In Particular'. A romantic relationship is also confirmed by Ness in several interviews. =Cillian Boyd= Cillian Boyd (kil-i-an) is Todd's other adoptive father, and a good friend of Todd's parents. He and Ben raise Todd after Todd's parents died. Cillian was convinced by Ben to come to New World, and he farms wheat and sheep. Cillian originally wanted to fight against the men of Prentisstown when they were killing the women, but Ben pacified him, arguing that they must pretend to go along with Prentiss so they could look after Todd. It is evident throughout the story that both Ben and Cillian are torn by guilt of essentially letting Todd's mother be murdered. He and Todd fight a lot, but according to Ben, this is because he cares about him. Cillian sacrifices himself in order to give Todd time to escape. Todd doesn't get along with Cillian as well as he does with Ben, but he still cares for him very much. According to Todd, Cillian's Noise is usually a reddish colour. =Manchee= Manchee is Todd‚Äôs pet dog. A gift from Cillian for Todd‚Äôs twelfth birthday, his thoughts are audible because of the Noise germ. Most of his dialogue consists of questions or simple words and declarations, such as \\"Squirrel!\\" or \\"Poo, Todd.\\" He was Todd‚Äôs closest friend, and follows Todd unconditionally after they escape Prentisstown. When Todd is attacked in vengeance by Matthew Lyle, Manchee defends him at the cost of a large chunk of his tail. In The Knife of Never Letting Go, a plan hatched by himself, Todd and Viola goes horribly wrong, and Todd is unable to stop Aaron from killing him. After his death, Todd finds himself unable to ever intentionally separate himself from any of his allies, as he fears that once again, it might result in tragic consequences that they will all regret. =Bradley Tench= The caretaker of the Beta, one of the ships of the convoy. He lands on New World with Simone in a scout ship to survey for possible town locations, because the convoy is under the assumption that the first ship didn't make it to New World due to a lack of communication. He is very disoriented by the Noise bug, especially when it reveals his love for Simone involuntarily, and blames Todd for her death. He is an unswayable advocate for peace during the negotiations between himself, the Mayor and Mistress Coyle, as well as between the humans and the Spackle, earning himself the nickname 'the humanitarian' among the Mayor's soldiers. =Simone Watkins= The caretaker of the Gamma, one of the ships of the convoy. She is killed when Mistress Coyle commits suicide in her attempt to kill the Mayor. Todd could have saved her, but he subconsciously chose to save the Mayor instead. She is a very capable with piloting machinery and negotiations, and she was going to teach Viola more about survival before her scout ship was deployed. She learns about Bradley's feelings for her when he develops Noise, but avoids the issue. The Ask Prominent characters who are members of Mayor Prentiss' army, The Ask. When the Mayor takes over Haven, the army becomes the largest force on New World, excepting the Spackle. =Mayor Prentiss/President David Prentiss= Mayor Prentiss is the mastermind behind the take over, and later becomes self-proclaimed President of New World. He is the one who forced Prentisstown into War, and the one who plotted the start of the next Spackle war. He is extremely charismatic and manipulative, often choosing to play mind games instead of resorting to brute force. Although for most it is an annoyance, he learns to control his Noise, and can even use it as a weapon. Despite his cruelties, a running theme throughout the trilogy is whether or not he can be redeemed. In the second book, he creates the Ask, an organization dedicated to opposing the Answer and destroying unrest within the population of Haven. He also captures Todd and forces him to work with him. Mayor Prentiss dislikes his son Davy, and frequently comments on how Todd would make for a better son. At the end of the second book, Prentiss kills Davy. It is later revealed that he would have sent Davy into war with an empty rifle. Todd and Viola have the Mayor at their mercy for a brief period of time, and just before they are about to end his life, the Spackle launch a surprise retaliation. He is released so that he can lead his army to defend the humans from the incoming war. In the third book, Mayor Prentiss continues to try to recruit Todd, but is instead changed by him. He becomes more moral, but cannot ignore the hollow emptiness he feels towards everything in the world. It is revealed that he had surpassed a point in his knowledge of Noise that has left his completely silenced and hateful of others‚Äô Noise. He treats Todd as if he were his own son, but when Ben arrives, he realizes that Todd will choose to be more like Ben instead of him. In Monsters of Men, Todd tries to kill him by using his Noise to force him to walk into the ocean, where enormous man-eating sea creatures dwell. However, the Mayor declares that he has changed due to Todd's goodness, and he does not want Todd to become like him by killing him. Declaring that the world will be much changed by them, and that he doesn't want to witness it, he walks into the ocean. =Davy Prentiss, Jr.= Son of Mayor Prentiss. In 'Old' Prentisstown, Davy was the local sheriff. In book one he is told to bring Todd and Viola to the Mayor, only he shoots Viola instead. Later, in the second book, he is ordered to work with Todd during The Ask and The Answer, carrying out tasks while constantly seeking his father‚Äôs approval. While initially he and Todd resent each other, they eventually develop a form of friendship during the Ask and the Answer. When Viola is being tortured, he saves her as Todd cannot. He is murdered by the end of The Ask and The Answer by his own father when he starts to turn out to be nice and 'human'. whilst he is dying, he also reveals to Todd through his Noise that he killed Ben, but regretted it later, and he begs Todd for forgiveness as he is about to die. =Aaron= The seemingly insane priest of Prentisstown. He constantly appears during the first book trying to provoke a fight with Todd, which always ends with Todd injuring him without killing him. His face is disfigured in the beginning of the book after being attacked by crocodiles and then later in the book, Aaron's nose is bitten off by Manchee, after Aaron attempted to attack Todd and Viola. At the end of the book, it's revealed that he was selected as the sacrifice for Todd's coming of age which requires him to kill someone in order to become a man, and Aaron has been trying to provoke Todd to kill him so that his aiding of the process will turn him into a saint. The plan ultimately fails, when at the end of the first book, Viola deliberately kills him in Todd's place to prevent Todd from becoming a murderer like Mayor Prentiss wants. =Ivan Farrow= A former civilian of Farbranch, Ivan joined the Mayor's army when his town is destroyed. He later joins the Answer after the Mayor demotes him to private and continuously treats him like dirt. He is an ambitious man who \\"goes wherever the power is\\", as is said by many characters of the novels. The Answer Characters who are part of Mistress Coyle's resistance army, The Answer. =Mistress Nicola Coyle= Mistress Coyle is the leader of the Answer. She sets up a camp away from Haven, committed to removing Mayor Prentiss from power. She enlists Viola‚Äôs help and shows members of the Answer how to set off homemade bombs. Although she does not resort to torture, she is just as manipulative and calculating as Mayor Prentiss. While she calls herself a freedom fighter, the members of The Ask label her as a terrorist. Despite being the head of an organization with just intentions, she is willing to do anything to end the Mayor's regime, even at the cost of sacrificing individual lives. When Viola escapes to find and help Todd, she sets her up with a bomb so that there's a chance that he could be caught in the explosion. In Monsters of Men, she kills herself in a final attempt to remove the Mayor from power and to possibly allow Viola to become a leader. =Wilf= A strange man who shows up periodically in the books. In his first appearance, he lets Todd and Viola ride on his cart as they navigate through a herd of an alien species similar to cattle. Viola tells him that their names are Ben and Hildy, to conceal their identities. Although he can tell that those are not their real names, he decides that it doesn't matter to him. Wilf can also hear in Todd's Noise that they are from Prentisstown, although unlike many other villagers that they run into, he does not react with fear and loathing. Despite his simple disposition, he has shown himself to be the most peaceful and honest man on New World, incapable of lies, and has been likened to the Sky of the Clearing. =Jane= Jane is Wilf's wife, though she does not share her husband's natural charisma. She helps the Mistresses at The Answer's camp. =Lee= A young soldier from the Answer, who falls in love with Viola during her stay with them. He eventually accepts that she will always love Todd, and helps her break him out of his cell during a major raid by the Answer. In the third book, his eyes are irreversibly damaged by a Spackle acid rifle, leaving him blind except for pictures in others' Noise. This does not stop him, however, from helping Todd and Viola during the Second Spackle War. He even leads the remaining soldiers who survived the destruction of New Prentisstown by the Spackle releasing the backed up river. The Land Although the human settlers called them the Spackle, their name for their species is simply the Land. Being a species that evolved with Noise, the entire population acts as one entity. =1017= 1017 is a Spackle who grew up domesticated in Haven. He is introduced in The Ask and the Answer. Forced to work for a violent owner, he falls in love with his ‚Äòone in particular‚Äô, the other Spackle in the household. However the other Spackle is killed whilst trying to protect 1017, and 1017 grows angry and vengeful, directing this hate at Todd (known to him as The Knife) because Todd witnesses the killing and torture of Spackle, and though he knows what is happening is wrong, he does nothing to stop it. When all of the Burden are killed, 1017 is left and runs to the Land, and is named The Return. He then urges the Sky to kill all humans, and lets his need for revenge control him. However, the Sky leads him to Ben and he learns that he cannot kill. When he becomes the new Sky, he almost wages war on all settlers, but stops short because he realises he is not doing what is right for the Land. With the knowledge that only peace can bring calamity, he lets the humans go. At the end of Monsters of Men, he shoots Todd with acid, though he knew he wasn‚Äôt sure if it was Todd or the Mayor in front of him. He offers to be killed by Viola as punishment, because he suffers knowing he killed another person, but Viola refuses to kill him as well as denying him forgiveness, so he will regret his action for the rest of his life. He shelters Todd and offers Viola medicine, in a gesture of peace. =The Sky= An appointed head of the Spackle, who has supreme rule over all Spackle affairs. A separate entity to the Land, who is alone, and must do what is right for the Land, not what is right by them. Orders from the Sky are followed unconditionally. The original Sky is killed in Monsters of Men, when the Mayor burns down the forest. Whilst dying, he chooses 1017 to be the new Sky. =The Burden= The name for those who were left to become domesticated slaves for the humans after the signing of the first treaty. Often regarded with remorse and guilt when remembered among Spackles. The Mayor kills them all to provoke another war with the Spackle. =The Clearing= The Spackle name for humans, due to their destructive nature. Other Various other citizens of New World, including members from towns such as Farbranch, Carbonel Downs, and Haven. =Hildy= Mathilde (more commonly known as Hildy) is a citizen of Farbranch. Hildy built the bridge that Todd and Viola crossed to get away from Prentisstown. She and Tam are the first people that Todd and Viola meet after leaving the swamp, and Hildy is also the second female he has ever met. Todd mistakes her for a man when they first meet and is confused about her lack of Noise. She is old enough to remember what life was like on Old World. It is hinted that she used to be one of the leaders of the town, although she seems to have stepped down from that role. Nonetheless, she still has much authority over the citizens of Farbranch. When Lyle was approaching Todd with hostility, she commanded him to step down, and he obeyed without her having to use any force. She built the bridge that connects Prentisstown to the rest of New World, and guards it every day in case someone tries to cross it. Her sister is the deputy mayor of Farbranch, although it is suggested that Hildy herself is the mayor. She and Tam came to New World on the first settler ship. Their house is made from the ship that they came down in, an Expansion X Three 200 that they remodeled to look like a swan. When talking about their home, Hildy mentions that she was an engineer. Hildy has lived on Old World so her parents weren't caretakers on the settler ship. =Tam= Tam is the husband of Hildy. He has a much more docile, relaxed personality compared to his wife, but they both welcome Todd and Viola into their home. He and Hildy are very close. =Mayor Jessica Elizabeth= Jessica Elizabeth was the Mayor of New Elizabeth, which was renamed Prentisstown after her death. She predicted that the men would attack the women of New Elizabeth and she organised some girls and younger boys to leave through the swamp. She intended to go across the swamp and escape with all of the women and the men who didn't want to kill them, but the rest of the men attacked before this could occur. She perished with the rest of the women of New Elizabeth. =Mayor Con Ledger= The former mayor of Haven, before Mayor Prentiss took over. He is introduced at the beginning of the second book. He shared Todd's cell with him, and gradually gave him information about the Answer, the Spackle War, and recent events. It is later revealed that Ledger was supplying Mayor Prentiss with all the information Todd gave him in return. He attempts to recapture Todd during his escape attempt with Viola and Lee, but is killed when he takes a Thrace bomb from Viola's bag, placed there by Mistress Coyle in an attempt to kill the Mayor.

These stars are known as \\"Goldilocks stars\\" as they emit enough radiation in the non-UV ray spectrum to provide a temperature that allows liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet; they also remain stable in the main phase longer than the Sun, allowing more time for life to form on a planet around a K-type main-sequence star. The planet's habitable zone, ranging from 0.1‚Äì0.4 to 0.3‚Äì1.3 astronomical units (AU), depending on the size of the star, is often far enough from the star so as not to be tidally locked to the star, and to have a sufficiently low solar flare activity not to be lethal to life. In comparison, red dwarf stars have too much solar activity and quickly tidally lock the planets in their habitable zones, making them less suitable for life. The odds of complex life arising may be better on planets around K-type main-sequence stars than around Sun-like stars, given the extra time available for it to evolve. Few planets thus far have been found around K-type main-sequence stars, but those that have are potential candidates for extraterrestrial life. Habitable zone A K-type star's habitable zone approximately ranges between 0.1‚Äì0.4 to 0.3‚Äì1.3 AU from the star. Here, exoplanets will receive only a relatively small amount of ultraviolet radiation, especially so towards the outer edge. This is favorable to support life, as it means that there is enough radiated energy to allow liquid water to exist on the surface, but not so much radiation as to destroy life. The habitable zone is also very stable, lasting for most of the K-type main-sequence star's main sequence phase.\\"Kepler's Hunt for Earths Shows Progress at Space Conference\\" Hadhazy, Adam March 9, 2010 12:00 AM Potentially habitable planets around K-type main-sequence stars A super- Earth orbiting a K-type main-sequence star called HD 85512 b appears to have habitability potential.

He served variously as Minister of Commerce, Minister of Finance and Revenue, and Minister of National Planning and Economic Development. At one time, he ran all three ministries simultaneously. He was considered the country's economic czar throughout the 1990s. Abel retired from the State Peace and Development Council and vacated his position as the Minister of the Chairman's Office on 25 August 2003. Early life and education Abel was born in 1935 in Insein, near Rangoon, but his family's roots were in Maymyo (now Pyin Oo Lwin). Abel's father, Alfred T. Abel was a Burma Railways engineer, while his mother Daw Chai, was a senior school teacher. Abel's father is an ethnic Indian Catholic, but he does have some Jewish ancestry. He is a Roman Catholic of mixed Anglo-Burman and Indian heritage. Abel matriculated from Maymyo's Saint Albert's Catholic Missionary School in 1951. He then studied medicine at Mandalay College but did not complete his degree because of an ongoing insurgency in Upper Burma. He then attended the British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) from 1953 to 1956, graduating with an economics degree. Military and governmental career Abel had served as the personal assistant of then-President General San Yu of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma. He retired the Tatmadaw in 1991 as a Director General of Procurement, with a rank of Brigadier General. Abel serving in the military, he has received many honours. Throughout his military career, he served in various civil administration posts. He was appointed by the State Law and Order Restoration Council to serve as a cabinet minister for the Ministry of Commerce (Burma), the Ministry of Finance (Burma), Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development, and the Ministry of State Peace and Development Council's Office before retiring in 2003. Abel was hailed as the economic architect of the country for pushing for privatisation and establishing some of the largest military-owned enterprises of the country, Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL), Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) in 1990, along with 12 joint venture companies, and served as Chairman of the Myanmar Investment Commission until 1997. Abel stood out as a member of the junta because he was media-friendly, outspoken and a member of a religious minority. He was a Roman Catholic in a junta dominated by Buddhists and before pre-publication censorship was lifted in August 2012 could only be referred to by his family name because his Christian name, ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù, was banned from publication.

Nutinsky 7 May 1920, in Philadelphia ‚Äì 30 January 2005, in Pompano Beach, Florida) was an American record company entrepreneur who, earlier in his career, worked with several independent labels. He then became sales manager at the 1955 startup of ABC-Paramount Records, ascending to president in 1965. He oversaw what became a major multimarket, multi-label company, which, for its jazz subsidiary Impulse!, included Ray Charles, Oliver Nelson, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, and John Coltrane.  Career  Newton's career began in 1938, while still in high school, when he worked in the stockroom of a Columbia distributor in Philadelphia. He became a salesman for Varsity, Combo, and Rainbow Records Newton enlisted December 1, 1941, in the U.S. Army and served as a paratrooper during World War II and was honorably discharged November 15, 1945. In 1946, Newton became sales manager for Black & White Records. In March 1949, Newton left B&W; to become general manager of Peak Records. Also, around July 1949, Newton co-founded, co-owned, and co-managed, with Eddie Heller, Derby Records ‚Äî which produced hit by the Eddie Wilcox Orchestra, with Sunny Gale singing \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" ‚Äì and Jaye P. Morgan. Newton overextended financially and, in 1953, formed a record Central Records with Lee Magid 1953. Eventually, in 1954, he had to file for bankruptcy. The Derby masters were sold to RCA where Newton became an executive. In 1955, Newton became General Manager of Murray Katz's Treat Records, then located at 236 West 55 Street in Manhattan. In 1956, he joined ABC-Paramount as sales manager where, in 1959, he rose to vice president of sales and, in 1965, president. 1967 saw Newton's most infamous decision: to not promote Louis Armstrong's recording of the song \\"What a Wonderful World\\". The song had been written with Armstrong in mind, but when Armstrong, who had recently signed with ABC Records, was recording it, Newton tried to stop the recording session, because he disliked the slow pace. Newton was physically locked out of the studio, and the session continued with him fuming outside. Afterward, Newton put no promotion effort into the single, calling it a mistake. \\"What a Wonderful World\\" did not do well in the U.S. as a result, though it succeeded elsewhere in the world, including hitting #1 in the UK. It remained essentially unknown in the United States until 20 years later, when it gained popularity after being used in the 1987 film Good Morning, Vietnam. In 1970, Newton became vice-president of ABC Pictures. In 1972, Newton returned to the record business by co-founding and heading GSF Records.  Death  Sometime in the 1940s, Newton married Dorothy Liberman (aka \\"Dolly;\\" 1921‚Äì2014). He passed away on January 30, 2005, in Pompano Beach, Florida. He was 84 years old.

Signs and symptoms  Patients usually present with otorrhea, conductive hearing loss, and otalgia, while bleeding and a sensation of a mass are much less common. Diagnosis = Imaging = Although imaging is not required to yield a diagnosis, it may be obtained to exclude other disorders, such as a concurrent cholesteatoma. = Pathology = By gross description, there is usually a solitary, polypoid, reddish mass behind an intact ear drum (tympanic membrane). The tissue is often friable, measuring <2 cm in most cases. All tissue should be processed in order to exclude a concurrent cholesteatoma. By microscopic exam, the polypoid appearance is maintained, showing a granulation-type tissue reaction with edematous stroma and a rich investment by capillaries. The surface of the polyp is covered by stratified squamous epithelium with a prominent granular cell layer. The tissue is filled with lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils. It is not uncommon to see plasma cells with Russell bodies and Mott cell formation. Depending on length of symptoms, multinucleated giant cells and calcifications may be seen. Other disorders may be concurrently present, especially since this is a post infectious/inflammatory disorder, and these include a cholesterol granuloma, \\"tunnel clusters\\" (glandular epithelial inclusions below the surface epithelium), and cholesteatoma. = Immunohistochemistry = Immunohistochemistry is unnecessary for the diagnosis, but will highlight a mixed B- and T-cell population within the lymphoid component, without light chain (kappa or lambda) restriction. Any muscle markers would be negative. = Differential diagnoses = The lesion presents in young patients, so the differential for a \\"polyp\\", especially when the lymphoid component is crushed or dominant, would include a rhabdomyosarcoma, extramedullary plasmacytoma, and a neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear.  Management  Since this lesion is usually a complication of long standing otitis media, it is important to use an appropriate antibiotic therapy regimen. If the patient fails first line antibiotics, then second-line therapies should be employed, especially after appropriate culture and sensitivity testing. Surgery may be required if there is extension into the mastoid bone, or if a concurrent cholesteatoma is identified during surgery or biopsy. In general, patients have an excellent outcome after appropriate therapy.  Epidemiology  This is an uncommon lesion, usually affecting young patients (mean age, 30 years), with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The middle ear is involved, although it may extend to the external auditory canal if there is tympanic membrane perforation.

Maclay began keeping the diary within two months of taking office and kept it almost daily during the 1st United States Congress. It is one of few accounts of the early United States Senate; sessions would not become open to the public until 1795. Composition and publication William Maclay, shortly after being elected by the Pennsylvania Legislature to the U.S. Senate, began to keep a diary of daily Senate proceedings for personal reference; it was not uncommon at the time for Senators to keep personal records of floor proceedings. In the diary, which he kept in the evenings, Maclay opined about his colleagues and commented on various issues of pertinence during the period. It is speculated by some Senate historians that the original incitation for the diary's creation was his somewhat uneasy relationship with the first Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate John Adams; the two differed sharply on many political issues. A nephew of Maclay, George Washington Harris, is responsible for the diary's initial publication after discovering three volumes after Maclay's death. For the next two decades, Harris unsuccessfully sought congressional support for publication of the diary, convinced it should be printed at public expense. Harris later published the diaries, with parts omitted, albeit on his own. An unabridged edition of the diary edited by Edgar Maclay, a distant cousin of the author, was eventually published in 1890 by D. Appleton & Company. Edgar Maclay, in the preface to the edition, criticized the previous, abridged edition. He believed the earlier version, because of its \\"expurgated\\" nature, was of diminished value. The diary is also included in The Diary of William Maclay and Other Notes on Senate Debates, published in 1988 as part of the Documentary History of the First Federal Congress by the Johns Hopkins University Press. To ensure the diary's contents would be available in the Library of Congress, the United States Congress ultimately purchased the original manuscript from Maclay's descendants in 1941 for .

History The CFGS format was apparently developed by the China Research Institute of Film Science & Technology and the China Film Group Corporation. It was created in an attempt to challenge the IMAX film format that dominated the premium large format movie market until that point. The aim was to lower costs and to allow the development of Chinese film projection technology using indigenous Chinese technology and intellectual property.

Biography Oshagan was born in 1883 as Hagop Kufejian in Soloz, a village near Bursa. Oshagan was spared the fate of many of his fellow writers and was able to elude the Turkish secret police until early 1918, when he fled from Constantinople to Bulgaria, disguised as a German officer. After the armistice, he returned to Constantinople in 1919, where he adopted his literary surname, and taught literature, actively participating in the literary activities of the Armenian community. At the end of 1922, as many other Armenian intellectuals, he left Constantinople permanently after the arrival of the Kemalist forces. He lived for a brief time in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and then worked as an instructor of Armenian literature in Egypt (1924-1928), Cyprus (1928-1935), and Palestine (1935-1948), where he forged a reputation as a charismatic educator and prolific writer of fiction, drama, and literary criticism. He died while on a visit to Aleppo, on the eve of a planned visit to Deir ez-Zor, where hundreds of thousands of Armenians had perished during the Armenian Genocide. The genocide of the Armenians defined Oshagan's larger project ‚Äî the literary reconstruction of the lost ancestral homeland. He wrote his major works in exile. He devoted his knowledge of Armenian literature, his intimate experience of village life and of Turkish- Armenian relations to this project. His output as a literary critic and historian is grounded in the monumental Panorama of Armenian Literature (’Ä’°’¥’°’∫’°’ø’Ø’•÷Ä ’°÷Ä’•÷Ç’¥’ø’°’∞’°’µ ’£÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’•’°’∂, 10 vols., 1945-1982), which has been used as a textbook in Armenian high schools. He is also the author of shorter, book-length volumes of literary studies. His son Vah√© Oshagan (1921-2000) followed in his father's footsteps. A poet, short story author, novelist, essayist, and literary scholar, he was one of the most important writers and public intellectuals of the Armenian diaspora.

The episode is written by Jeremy Doner and is directed by Phil Abraham. In the episode, the detectives learn the identity of the bearer of the Ogi Jun manga tattoo; Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) and Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) discuss the future of the campaign; and Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) learns that he is not free of his mob past. Plot Detectives Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) and Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) sit in a car across the street from the Larsen garage, where they see a group of men arrive to get into two Larsen moving vans. Since they are not dressed as movers, Holder believes that the men are not Stan's employees. The detectives follow the vans to the back of a Polish restaurant to watch the men load boxes into the vans. He recalls that the restaurant is owned by Janek Kovarsky, and she ponders if Stan Larsen is back with the Polish mob. The next morning, they visit Corey Petersen (Martin Cummins), an organized crime specialist with the FBI. They speak of the possible mob connection to the Larsen case and show him the Ogi Jun tattoo from Rosie's Super 8 mm film. Not recognizing the tattoo, he does note that arson is Janek's specialty, alluding to the previous Beau Soleil building fire. Petersen also tells them that Stan Larsen is suspected of killing a man named Piotr Michaelski in exchange for being allowed to leave the mob. He shows them a picture of Piotr in the trunk of a car, hands bound, shot in the head. Peterson also mentions Piotr had a wife. Stan Larsen receives a phone call about Belko Royce. He tells them that they are not cremating him and that he will come to claim his body for burial. Terry Marek (Jamie Anne Allman) tells him that his son Tommy has been acting out for two days. He says that he will deal with that later as he has to the morgue for Belko. Later at the morgue, Stan learns that a funeral home has already retrieved Belko's body. He walks into a church and finds Janek Kovarsky (Don Thompson) sitting by Belko's closed coffin. Janek reflects on the difference between Belko and Stan, calling Belko the better man. He informs Stan that school bullies have been teasing Tommy about Rosie. At the school, Stan sees his son (Evan Bird) getting bullied and tells him to fight back rather than walk away. The detectives question Monica Krol (Maria Marlow), Piotr's wife, who says the police should have arrested Stan 17 years ago. She appears to harbor a grudge, but not enough to warrant investigating for Rosie's murder. At the station, Holder suggests asking Rosie's friend Sterling Fitch about the tattoo. Linden gets a phone call from a lawyer, saying that her ex-husband is suing for joint custody of Jack. At the school, Sterling (Kacey Rohl) tells them that the tattoo belongs to a man who used to hang around the Larsen house and creeped Rosie out. Down the hall, Jasper Ames (Richard Harmon) watches them. At the hospital, Darren Richmond orders Jamie Wright to help him into a wheelchair. Jamie cannot support Richmond's weight, and they fall to the floor. Later, Mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler) and Benjamin Abani (Colin Lawrence) visit. Adams says that he will support Darren's campaign in four years but Darren wonders if Adams was responsible for his arrest. Darren later informs Jamie that he is withdrawing from the race. Jamie argues with him, saying he has spent 10 years helping him. He tells Jamie to get a life. In a juvenile prison, the detectives question Benissimo Lee (Eitra Kennedy), who is known for his tattoo work among the inmates. As a bribe, Sarah sneaks him a candy bar and shows him the Ogi Jun tattoo photo. He says he gave the tattoo to a foster kid named \\"Giffs\\". At the police station, Holder tells her that \\"Giffs\\" is Alexi Giffords, a foster child who went through five homes in 10 years. Giffords' file shows his current address, three blocks from the Larsens. While sitting in the car near Alexi's house, Sarah tells Holder that the foster records cannot be viewed without Alexi's consent. He recalls that she, like Alexi, ran away from foster homes as a child. Denying it, she orders him out of the car and to keep an eye on the house. She visits Regi Darnell (Annie Corley) to ask for access to Alexi's foster file. She refuses, but Sarah argues that it might help solve Rosie's murder. While mopping his van, Stan finds frayed wiring on the floor and goes to Janek‚Äôs restaurant to confront him. Janek admits to burning down Beau Soleil, and Stan accuses him of playing a role in Rosie's murder. A young man slips out the door. Minutes later, the young man (Tyler Johnson) arrives at the house that Holder is monitoring. Noticing an Ogi Jun tattoo on the thug's arm, Holder realizes the man is Alexi, who sees Holder, runs, and gets away. A Department of Children's Services case worker (Kelli-Ruth Mercier) meets Sarah in her car. She reveals that Alexi's birth name is Michaelski and that his mother is Monica Krol, as Holder finds a photo of a young Alexi with father Piotr in Alexi's apartment. Sarah arrives to find a piece of paper tucked inside an Ogi Jun manga comic. The paper is a drawing of Rosie with her face scratched out. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Ogi Jun\\" received mixed reviews. Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C, saying \\"Like so many contemporary television dramas and B-movies with exorbitant budgets, The Killing's stuck straddling the expansive gulf between its origins‚Äîmuscular, exploitative, low- rent crime pulp‚Äîand its aspirations‚Äîlong-form prestige drama. So it winds up settling for shallow melodrama, deeply invested in the inner lives, well, inner griefs of all these characters connected to this single crime without much animating thematic purpose. It‚Äôs constantly dusting off the old dark discoveries and presenting them as new insights, when simply crafting a cold, hard narrative is more than enough.\\" Paste Magazine's Adam Vitcavage gave the episode a 7.3 rating, but commented: \\"The moody drama appears to be grasping at straws trying to find a new angle and acts as if the entire first season was a prologue to something bigger.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline called the episode a \\"refreshing change of pace\\", adding \\"'Ogi Jun' was a step in the right direction, but an episode with few actual highlights, making it a pleasing piece of the whole but hardly a stellar night of television on its own.\\" TV Fanatic‚Äôs Sean McKenna rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars, commenting \\"There's still something to be said for this show and, despite certain aspects that can be grating or frustrating, the atmosphere of The Killing is certainly a change from other programs. The world isn't so cookie cutter perfect and as long as the rest of the season maintains balance and avoids clich√©s, the bigger mystery will hopefully be a satisfying payoff. Hopefully.\\" =Ratings= The episode was watched by 1.65 million viewers and obtained a 0.6 adults 18-49 rating, marking the series' third-lowest ratings.

Though any soundtrack of a film is dependent on the visuals for narrative, the soundtrack of Citizen Kane succeeds by itself, no doubt because of Welles's and Herrmann's extensive background in producing radio dramas. ‚Ä¶ Garabadian's release of Citizen Kane's entire soundtrack (47 years after its premiere) is indicative of a changing trend in the release of music soundtracks. After record producers noticed that consumers would accept a compilation of excerpts as they appear in the film, there was less of a desire to record suites and other concert arrangements. Though suites are suitable for the concert hall, their contents reflect a necessary alteration of the original film score.\\" (Robert Kosovsky) -align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\" 1979  align=\\"left\\" 1979  align=\\"left\\" The Late Great Planet Earth  align=\\"left\\" LP record  align=\\"left\\" RCR Productions (ACG-10022)  align=\\"left\\" Original motion picture soundtrack -align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"left\\" 1980  align=\\"left\\" 1967  align=\\"left\\" A King's Story  align=\\"left\\" LP Record  align=\\"left\\" DRG Records (SL 5185)  align=\\"left\\" Original motion picture soundtrack } Interviews { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

It emerged in 2010 as problems with an increased wealth gap became gradually more apparent. If economic development is seen as analogous to baking a cake, one side of the debate suggests that development should focus on 'dividing the cake more fairly,' while the other says development should be focused on 'baking a bigger cake.' Synopsis Thirty years of economic growth in China has resulted in higher standards of living and a substantial growth in national income, but also led to a widening wealth gap and a host of associated social problems. Conflicts are emerging between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' of society. The nouveau riche are seen as variously the beneficiaries of their hard work and enterprising character under the new market economy, or as cheaters of the system and inheritors of unfair privilege. At the 2010 National People's Congress, Premier Wen Jiabao remarked that \\"we must develop our economy to make the cake that is prosperity bigger, but also use a reasonable system to distribute the cake fairly.\\" To deal with the increasingly sharp conflicts between different interest groups, the Communist Party of China was said to have split ideologically over the \\"cake issue\\". On one side, orthodox communists suggest that the solution is to focus on distributing the wealth while pursuing higher growth (\\"dividing the cake\\"), while reformers and liberals suggest that the solution is to pursue continued growth and worry about dividing the wealth once the material wealth threshold is reached (\\"baking a bigger cake\\"). The ideological cleavage surfaced publicly in a war of words in late 2011, when Guangdong party chief Wang Yang stated that \\"one must bake a bigger cake first before dividing it.\\" Original quote: Ë¶ÅÈÄöËøáÂèëÂ±ïÁªèÊµéÔºåÊääÁ§æ‰ºöË¥¢ÂØåËøô‰∏™ËõãÁ≥ïÂÅöÂ§ßÔºå‰πüË¶ÅÈÄöËøáÂêàÁêÜÁöÑÊî∂ÂÖ•ÂàÜÈÖçÂà∂Â∫¶ÊääËõãÁ≥ïÂàÜÂ•Ω Wang said that \\"continued economic development\\" must take precedence over all other tasks. In response, Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai remarked, \\"Some people think [...] that one must bake a large cake before dividing it; but this is wrong in practice. Because if the distribution of the cake is unfair, those who make the cake won't feel motivated to bake it; therefore we can't bake a bigger cake.\\" Original quote: Êúâ‰∫∫ËÆ§‰∏∫Ôºå‰Ω†ÊÄªË¶ÅÂÖàÊääÁªèÊµéÊêû‰∏äÂéªÔºåÊå£‰∫ÜÈí±ÊâçËÉΩÊîπÂñÑÊ∞ëÁîüÂêßÔºÅ‚ÄòËõãÁ≥ï‚ÄôÂÅöÂ§ß‰∫ÜÊâçËÉΩÂàÜ‚ÄòËõãÁ≥ï‚ÄôÔºåËøôÁúã‰ººÊúâÁêÜÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÆûË°å‰∏çÈÄö„ÄÇÂõ†‰∏∫‚ÄòËõãÁ≥ï‚ÄôÂàÜÂæó‰∏çÂÖ¨Âπ≥ÔºåÂÅö‚ÄòËõãÁ≥ï‚ÄôÁöÑ‰∫∫Â∞±Ê≤°ÊúâÁßØÊûÅÊÄßÔºåËøô‚ÄòËõãÁ≥ï‚ÄôÂ∞±ÊÄª‰πüÂÅö‰∏çÂ§ß„ÄÇ The egalitarian 'divide-the-cake' approach is an important component of the \\"Chongqing Model\\" advanced by former star politician Bo Xilai. Bo gave the city's throngs of migrant workers residency status so they could enjoy the same rights and privileges given to urban residents, such as health care and education. In addition, Bo pursued a wide array of public housing programs, and cracked down on local gangsters, businesspeople, and their cronies in government.Jiang, Wenran Bo Xilai, a fallen star in an opaque land , The Globe and Mail, 16 March 2012. While the \\"Chongqing Model\\" won significant accolades from some of China's top leaders, pundits remarked that ultimately it became too dependent on the personality of Bo Xilai himself, and thus the expansion of the model to other areas of the country would be difficult. The metaphor is said to be emblematic of the ideological struggles within the top echelons of China's leadership. It asks the central question of whether further growth or fair distribution should be at the centerpiece of China's political agenda.

Biography Guinot was born in eastern France and educated at the University of Montpellier and the University of Paris, finishing her studies in 1955. She then joined the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle as a research assistant; she remained there for the rest of her career. She earned a doctorate from Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1977. Research Guinot carried out several studies of crabs from exotic environments, including deep-sea crabs from the Indo-West Pacific bathyal zone and from hydrothermal vents, and crabs living in caves in Papua New Guinea. Her doctoral thesis proposed a new classification system for certain crabs based on the position of their reproductive organs. In later studies, she became particularly interested in crab behavior, including stridulation, carrying, and camouflage. Over the course of her career she described 10 new families of crabs, 47 new genera, and 163 new species. Guinot has also studied the history of crabs and of their interactions with humans, including crab fishing techniques, medicinal uses of crabs, and the study of Cretaceous fossil crabs. Awards and honors In 2008, Guinot was the recipient of the Excellence in Research Award of the Crustacean Society.. More than 30 genera and species have been named in honor of Guinot.

She was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for her entire uneventful career. She was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad in 1892 before she became a training ship later that decade. Admiral Greig was decommissioned in 1907, stricken from the Navy List in 1909 and scrapped in 1912. Design and description Right elevation and plan from Brassey's Naval Annual 1888 The Admiral Lazarev-class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors, the , and had an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ships were designed to displace , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced . They were fitted with a plough-shaped ram. Their crew consisted of 269‚Äì74 officers and crewmen. The Admiral Lazarev-class ships had a single two-cylinder horizontal direct-acting steam engine that drove a single propeller, using steam provided by four rectangular fire-tube boilers. The engine was designed to produce a total of which gave a heavily loaded Admiral Greig a speed of from when she ran her sea trials in October 1871. The ships had a range of about at a speed of and were fitted with a light fore-and-aft sailing rig to steady them and aid in maneuvering.McLaughlin, pp. 115‚Äì16, 122‚Äì23 =Armament= The monitors were originally designed to be armed with six 20-caliber Obukhov rifled muzzle- loading guns, a pair in each Coles-type turret. Around 1874‚Äì1875 the guns were replaced by three 17-caliber, 11-inch rifled guns, based on a Krupp design. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, a 9-inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships, but accuracy was poor and they were later removed, probably in the early 1880s. A more powerful, 22-caliber, 11-inch gun was installed aboard Admiral Greig and her sister ship during the 1880s.McLaughlin, pp. 118‚Äì19 Light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to the Admiral Lazarev class during the Russo-Turkish War when a pair of 4-pounder guns were mounted on the roofs of the fore and aft gun turrets and a , 4-barreled Engstrem quick-firing (QF) gun. By the early 1890s, Admiral Greigs light armament consisted of one Baranov QF gun, five QF Hotchkiss guns, replacing the 4-pounders, and a pair of QF Hotchkiss five-barreled revolving cannon. The monitors could also carry 12‚Äì15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage.McLaughlin, pp. 119‚Äì20 =Armor= The hull of the Admiral Lazarev-class monitors was completely covered by wrought iron armor that thick amidships and thinned to aft and forward of the main belt. The turrets had inches of armor, except around the gun ports, where it thickened to . The conning tower was thick and the deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch.McLaughlin, pp. 121‚Äì22 Construction and service Admiral Greig, named for Admiral Samuel Greig,Silverstone, p. 371 was ordered in 1865 from the New Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 1 September although the formal keel-laying was not until 10 May 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 30 October and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep- draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1872 at the cost of 1,596,700 rubles.McLaughlin, pp. 113‚Äì14 The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion, but Admiral Greig was not fully equipped until around 1872. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1881‚Äì1882McLaughlin, p. 123 and again around 1900‚Äì1903, possibly with cylindrical boilers.Watts, p. 107 She was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and frequently served with the Artillery Training Detachment of the Baltic Fleet. Admiral Greig was transferred to the Port of Kronstadt on 31 March 1907 and was stricken on 22 December 1909. The ship was scrapped in Saint Petersburg in 1912.McLaughlin, p. 125 One source suggests that she and her sister , and the two s, were used as floating piers for the railroad bridge over the Svir River during the construction of the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìMurmansk Railroad in 1916 before being scrapped in the 1920s.\\"Russian Monitors and Coast Defense Ships\\", p. 308 Notes Footnotes References  * Further reading Category:Ships built at Admiralty Shipyard Category:Admiral Lazarev-class monitors Category:1867 ships ","title":"Russian monitor Admiral Greig"},{"id":"35510818","text":"The 1973 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team represented Louisiana Tech University during the 1973 NCAA Division II football season, and completed the 71st season of Bulldogs football and their first as members of the reorganized NCAA Division II.

Theory The two-state vector formalism is one example of a time-symmetric interpretation of quantum mechanics (see Interpretations of quantum mechanics). Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by Walter Schottky in 1921, and later by several other scientists. The two-state vector formalism was first developed by Satosi Watanabe in 1955, who named it the Double Inferential state-Vector Formalism (DIVF). Watanabe proposed that information given by forwards evolving quantum states is not complete; rather, both forwards and backwards evolving quantum states are required to describe a quantum state: a first state vector that evolves from the initial conditions towards the future, and a second state vector that evolves backwards in time from future boundary conditions. Past and future measurements, taken together, provide complete information about a quantum system. Watanabe's work was later rediscovered by Yakir Aharonov, Peter Bergmann and Joel Lebowitz in 1964, who later renamed it the Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF).Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: Protective measurements of two-state vectors, in: Robert Sonn√© Cohen, Michael Horne, John J. Stachel (eds.): Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion- At-A-Distance, Quantum Mechanical Studies for A. M. Shimony, Volume Two, 1997, , pp. 1‚Äì8, p. 2 Conventional prediction, as well as retrodiction, can be obtained formally by separating out the initial conditions (or, conversely, the final conditions) by performing sequences of coherence-destroying operations, thereby cancelling out the influence of the two state vectors. The two-state vector is represented by: where the state \\\\langle\\\\Phi evolves backwards from the future and the state \\\\Psi\\\\rangle evolves forwards from the past. In the example of the double-slit experiment, the first state vector evolves from the electron leaving its source, the second state vector evolves backwards from the final location of the electron on the detection screen, and the combination of forwards and backwards evolving state vectors determines what occurs when the electron passes the slits. The two-state vector formalism provides a time-symmetric description of quantum mechanics, and is constructed such as to be time-reversal invariant.Michael Dickson: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics, Jeremy Butterfield, John Earman (eds.): Philosophy of Physics, Handbook of the Philosophy of Science, North-Holland, Elsevier, pp. 275‚Äì416, Footnote on p. 327 It can be employed in particular for analyzing pre- and post-selected quantum systems. Building on the notion of two-state, Reznik and Aharonov constructed a time-symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics that encompasses probabilistic observables as well as nonprobabilistic weak observables. Relation to other work In view of the TSVF approach, and in order to allow information to be obtained about quantum systems that are both pre- and post-selected, Yakir Aharonov, David Albert and Lev Vaidman developed the theory of weak values. In TSVF, causality is time- symmetric; that is, the usual chain of causality is not simply reversed. Rather, TSVF combines causality both from the past (forward causation) and the future (backwards causation, or retrocausality). Similarly as the de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory, TSVF yields the same predictions as standard quantum mechanics.Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidmann: About position measurements which do not show the Bohmian particle position, in: James T. Cushing, Arthur Fine, Sheldon Goldstein (eds.): Bohmian mechanics and quantum theory: an appraisal, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996, pp. 141‚Äì154, p. 141, 147 Lev Vaidman emphasizes that TSVF fits very well with Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation,Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review.

The two-state vector formalism has similarities with the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by John G. Cramer in 1986, although Ruth Kastner has argued that the two interpretations (Transactional and Two-State Vector) have important differences as well.Ruth E.

History Astro Pops were first made in 1963 after two rocket scientists working on the space program in El Segundo, California decided to quit their jobs and create the Astro Pop, modeling the pop after a three-stage rocket. They hand-built equipment, including machines to speed up the production of the cone wrappers. Astro Pops are unusual because the cone wrapper becomes the mold for the candy. Hot candy is poured directly into the wrapper, then a paper stick is added and the pop is capped off with a layer of wax. Because Astro Pops were created in the 1960s, at the same time in history when the Space Race was in full force, millions of Astro Pops were sold when the manufacturers capitalized on this craze. In 1987, Spangler Candy Company (the makers of Dum Dums, Circus Peanuts and Safe-T-Pops) acquired the Astro Pops brand from the Nellson Candy Company of Los Angeles, California. The original three flavors of the candy are cherry, passionfruit, and pineapple. Spangler expanded the Astro Pop line of lollipops with flavors such as banana split and caramel apple. In 1997, Spangler and the 7-Eleven convenience store chain were sued by a couple in Skagit County, Washington, who alleged that their son was injured by an Astro Pop. At the beginning of 2000, Spangler decided to reverse the shape of the Astro Pop, placing the stick at the tip of the pop, rather than the base. They felt it would give the consumer more surface area to lick. In September 2004, Spangler discontinued the product line. In 2010, Ellia Kassoff purchased the brand. It is now part of Leaf Brands, LLC's portfolio of brands. Leaf has also expanded the Astro Pops franchise to include Astro Pop Asteroids (smaller bite-sized pieces), and Astro Pops Sodas. Kassoff paid Spangler cash for the recipes, global rights to the trademark, and three years of royalty payments. The original manufacturing equipment had been sold for scrap so Leaf had to reinvent the manufacturing process. Kassoff, with his company Strategic Marks, has become known as a \\"brand revivalist\\", who revived the Leaf brand that was once owned by his uncle before being acquired by Hershey in 1996. At that time Leaf made candy such as Jolly Ranchers, Milk Duds, and Whoppers.

He served as the politician in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii. He later was baptized into the Anglican Church of Hawaii with the name Albert Fredrick Kunuiakea Oiwiaulani Koenaokalani.  Early life and family  K≈´nuiƒÅkea was born on June 19, 1851 at his mother's residence at Kuaihelani, on Beretania Street, Honolulu, where the Central Union Church now stands. He and his twin brother were born to King Kamehameha III and his mistress Jane Lahilahi. Lahilahi was married to Joshua Ka ªeo by whom she had a son named Peter Ka ªeo, his older half-brother. From his mother's family, he was the grandson of John Young, the British advisor of Kamehameha I, and Ka ª≈çana ªeha, the daughter of Kamehameha I's brother Keli ªimaika ªi. In the Hawaiian language, his name K≈´nuiƒÅkea means \\"K≈´ the Supreme One\\" while his second name K≈´ka ªilimoku means \\"K≈´ the Snatcher of Land\\" and honor the war god K≈´, the patron deity of his grandfather King Kamehameha I who conquered and unified the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1810. Sources are disputed on the name and exact fate of his twin brother. Under the name Kƒ´wala ª≈ç, it was claimed he was taken by Kamehameha III and his wife Queen Kalama to raise while K≈´nuiƒÅkea was brought back to his maternal family to be reared. The Hawaiian custom of hƒÅnai is an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. Other genealogy of the Young family name a son by Lahilahi and Ka ªeo called Alebada Keli ªimaika ªi. He was adopted by their maternal uncle James KƒÅnehoa and died on October 13, 1851. This may or may not be the same person as Kƒ´wala ª≈ç. When this brother died as an infant, K≈´nuiƒÅkea was hƒÅnai (adopted) to the royal couple and raised at the Royal Palace.  Succession to the throne  Kamehameha III died in 1854 and was succeeded by his nephew and adopted heir Alexander Liholiho as Kamehameha IV. K≈´nuiƒÅkea was not eligible for the throne since the Hawaiian constitution only permitted succession through legitimate lines. Later, non-contemporary sources claimed Kamehameha III wanted K≈´nuiƒÅkea in the succession. According to an 1883 publication of the Hawaiian newspaper Ka Nupepa Kuokoa, Kamehameha III wanted to make K≈´nuiƒÅkea his second heir after Alexander Liholiho. However, K≈´nuiƒÅkea's maternal uncle Keoni Ana, who was the Kuhina Nui (premier or co-ruler), opposed this plan and insisted that Alexander Liholiho be followed by Lot KapuƒÅiwa. Keoni Ana's opposition stopped Kamehameha III's plan.  Adulthood  In 1862, he was baptized Albert Fredrick Kunuiakea Oiwiaulani Koenaokalani into the newly established Anglican Church of Hawaii founded by his cousin Queen Emma and her husband Kamehameha IV. K≈´nuiƒÅkea was betrothed to Miriam Likelike, the younger sister of King KalƒÅkaua and Queen Lili ªuokalani. However, she married Scottish businessman Archibald Scott Cleghorn and became the mother Princess Ka ªiulani. In 1876, his cousin Queen Emma considered other possible royal brides for him including Elizabeth Keomailani Crowningburg, Theresa Owana La ªanui, and possibly the Tahitian nieces of Ninito Sumner from the Salmon family. He would marry Mary Lonokahikini, the widow of Reverend Z. Poli, instead. In 1872, Kamehameha V died without naming an heir and his cousin Lunalilo was unanimously elected to the throne. The new king died in 1874 after a short reign, also without naming a successor, causing the legislators to convene and elect a new monarch again. From the pool of eligible ali ªi's, only three candidates were considered seriously ‚Äì Bernice Pauahi Bishop (who did not actively seek the throne), David KalƒÅkaua, and Queen Emma. KalƒÅkaua won the legislative election, and Emma's defeated supporters instigated the Honolulu Courthouse riot immediately after. In order to quell the civil disruption, American and British troops were landed with the permission of the Hawaiian government, and the rioters were arrested.; ; ; After the controversial 1874 election, Emma's former supporters formed the political opposition party to undermine the new dynasty. K≈´nuiƒÅkea became a member of this Queen Emma Party and joined with Representatives Joseph NƒÅwahƒ´ of Hilo and George Washington Pilip≈ç of North Kona in forming the native opposition against KalƒÅkaua. K≈´nuiƒÅkea was elected to the House of Representative, representing the district of Honolulu on Oahu in 1880. On January 17, 1893, the monarchy was overthrown and Queen Lili ªuokalani was deposed by the Committee of Safety with the covert support of United States Minister John L. Stevens and the landing of American forces from the USS Boston. After a brief transition under the Provisional Government, the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii was established on July 4, 1894, with Sanford B. Dole as president. During this period, the defacto government was composed largely of residents of American and European ancestry, although a few Native Hawaiians including K≈´nuiƒÅkea served in political roles.; He became a member of the Constitutional Convention charged with drafting a new constitution for the Republic and was one of the five Native Hawaiian signatories of the document.;  Death and funeral  K≈´nuiƒÅkea died on March 10, 1903, in Honolulu, at the age of 51. As a sign of respect to his position as one of the last descendants of Kamehameha the Great, the Hawaiian territorial government held a state funeral for K≈´nuiƒÅkea. After lying in state in the former throne room of the  ªIolani Palace, he was laid to rest at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna  ªAla. His remains were moved along with political advisor Robert Crichton Wyllie and other members of Queen Emma's family to the newly build Wyllie Tomb in June 1904.

It is the fifth \\"Super Edition\\" in the Warriors novel series. Yellowfang's Secret was first released in hardcover on 9 October 2012. Yellowfang's Secret follows Yellowfang, the former ShadowClan and ThunderClan medicine cat, during her early life in ShadowClan. Yellowfang trains as an apprentice but realizes that she is better suited as a medicine cat and begins her new life. The book takes place chronologically at around the same time as the other Super Editions Bluestar's Prophecy and Crookedstar's Promise. Plot Yellowkit is born to Brightflower and Brackenfoot along with littermates Nutkit and Rowankit. Yellowkit is apprenticed to Deerleap. Yellowpaw becomes close with Raggedpelt, whose father is unknown and suspected to have been a house cat, leading some to shun him as house cats are shunned for being \\"soft\\". Yellowpaw attempts to help him discover the truth, but her efforts only worsen the situation when she and Raggedpelt discover that Raggedpelt was indeed fathered by a housecat named Hal. Hal rejects Raggedpelt. The warrior Raggedpelt, kills his father, and denies having a father as well. Yellowpaw eventually repairs her relationship with Raggedpelt, after saving his life, much to the dismay of Foxheart, who has made her affection for Raggedpelt quite obvious. From a young age, Yellowfang personally experiences others' pain as her own. For instance, as a kit, she and her brother Nutkit both have stomach pains, although Nutkit was the only one who consumed carrion. Eventually, Sagewhisker, the ShadowClan medicine cat, convinces Yellowfang that this ability would make her more effective as a medicine cat if she could learn to control the powers, despite Yellowfang's initial resistance to the idea. Sagewhisker thus takes Yellowfang on as an apprentice, and Yellowfang takes the medicine cats' vows, including the forsaking of taking a mate. Despite this, she and Raggedpelt continue their relationship in secret, up until Yellowfang is declared a full medicine cat. Eventually, it is discovered that Yellowfang is pregnant, a violation of the medicine cat code. Yellowfang gives birth in secret, but only one kit survives. She then hands this kit, Brokenkit, to Raggedpelt, who has them cared for by another she-cat while shielding the mother's identity; many believe the mother to be Foxheart however. Brokenkit grows up spoiled, his parents, who are in positions of power, indulge him and refuse to punish him, and he develops into a vicious cat without learning empathy and other virtuous character traits as a result. Eventually, Brokenkit becomes the warrior Brokentail, and later, deputy. Brokentail trains his apprentices with extreme methods, which go unchecked as his father refuses to see the wrong in his son's actions. When he finally reprimands Brokentail, Brokentail appears to acquiesce, but secretly sets up a ploy to murder his father to gain control of the Clan, while blaming the death on neighbouring WindClan. Having taken over ShadowClan, Brokenstar institutes a vicious regime, bullying his way to eventual near-totalitarian power. Using his father's death as an excuse, he begins to launch many attacks on the neighbouring Clans, many of which Yellowfang considers unnecessary. Brokenstar, however, rejects all criticism, continuing the attacks and eventually implementing extreme tactics to keep his war efforts going: he begins training kits before they are six months old (the age laid down in the warrior code as when apprenticeship may begin), and asking the elders, who cannot contribute to the fighting forces, to leave camp in order to save resources. When a kit dies in battle, Yellowfang speaks out; Brokenstar soon secretly sets up another ploy, accusing his own mother of the deaths of two kits, and banishing her from the Clan. Yellowfang leaves; eventually she enters ThunderClan territory, where, exhausted by rage and hunger, she is apprehended by Firepaw (a scene initially depicted in Into the Wild from Firepaw's perspective), where after a brief fight, Yellowfang admits defeat. Yellowfang is later cared for by Firepaw as a punishment from Bluestar, the Thunderclan leader, from feeding Yellowfang before he fed the clan.  Critical reception  Barnes and Noble described the series as continuing \\"in high style\\".

The Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan Line existed from the opening of the Dan Ryan branch on September 28, 1969 until February 21, 1993. When created, the route united two transit corridors that until 1969 never had through rail service. This routing, which became known as the West-South route, operated from the Harlem terminal in Forest Park on the Lake Street \\"L\\" through downtown Chicago along the Union Loop \\"L\\", and then via the old South Side \\"L\\" and the new Dan Ryan Line to the 95th Street Terminal. The Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan service was planned in conjunction with the former Franklin Street Connector and Chicago Central Area Transit Project (Loop and Distributor Subways), both of which were never constructed. The section of the route between the junction with the South Side \\"L\\" at 17th and State Streets and the Cermak‚ÄìChinatown Station was originally an \\"interim\\" or temporary facility, which was to be torn down when the Loop Subway system was completed, but survived after the project was cancelled in 1979. That section was improved in the 1980s and early 1990s and is currently used by the Orange Line. Train transfers are possible by using the two unused tracks. History The Lake Street branch, Chicago's second oldest elevated rail line, began operations on November 6, 1893 from Madison and Market Streets (present-day Wacker Drive) to California Avenue and Lake Street. It was built by the Lake Street Elevated Railroad Company and originally equipped with small 0-4-4T Forney type steam locomotives hauling wooden coaches. Electrification of the road was completed between 1894 and 1896. \\"L\\" service was subsequently extended west into the western suburbs of Oak Park in 1899 and Forest Park in 1910. The Lake Street branch was also the first \\"L\\" road to operate around the Union Loop \\"L\\" on September 3, 1897, five weeks before its official inauguration. Shortly after the CTA assumed control of the city's bus and rail systems, Lake Street service was changed with the closing of several stations (Morgan, Racine, Ogden, Damen, Oakley, Sacramento, Hamlin, Kostner, Menard, and Lombard) and the old Market Street stub in 1948. The western 2.6 mile section between Laramie Avenue and the Forest Park terminal, which consisted of at-grade trackage, was elevated onto the adjacent Union Pacific Railroad embankment on October 28, 1962. The grade separation improvement (one of CTA's 1958 New Horizons programs) alleviated 22 street level crossings which plagued pedestrian, auto, and rapid transit movements for nearly 70 years. Following the successful introduction of the Congress Line in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway in June 1958, the City of Chicago began construction on two more expressway rapid transit extensions in 1967: the Milwaukee branch from Logan Square to Jefferson Park via Kennedy Expressway, and the Dan Ryan Expressway Line from 17th Street to 95th Street. The nine stations, located at Cermak-Chinatown, Sox-35th, 47th, Garfield, 63rd, 69th, 79th, 87th, and the 95th Street Terminal, were designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, under the direction of Myron Goldsmith who emphasized a modernist approach to their design in the fashion of his mentor and predecessor, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. However, no station was planned at Roosevelt/Wabash (until 1987) because of its close proximity to the State Street subway, and because the \\"L\\" was going to be torn down and Dan Ryan (and eventually Midway) service shifted into the Franklin Street Connector and into the Loop. It was also considered to route Dan Ryan service to the North Side before its construction from 1967 to 1969. Funding for the Kennedy and Dan Ryan rail projects would not allow for the necessary connections to the State Street subway at the time, so, it was decided to combine the Lake Street \\"L\\" with the new Dan Ryan Line uniting the West and South Sides of the City. Thus, at 4:16 a.m. on September 28, 1969, Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan service began from the 95th Street Terminal north to downtown Chicago via the Union Loop \\"L\\" and west to Harlem. Traffic on both legs of the Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan line was nearly level until the mid-1970s when passenger volumes began to shift on the West-South route and the North-South route (Howard‚ÄìEnglewood/Jackson Park), inclusive, with heavier traffic on the Howard and Dan Ryan branches, and lesser traffic on the Lake Street and South Side branches. In February 1993, the CTA overhauled its system and launched a color-coded route plan. In the process, the Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan route was split. The Lake Street branch running west of the Loop became a part of the Green Line, and the Dan Ryan branch running south of the Loop became a part of the Red Line. On February 4, 1977, a train on the Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan line was involved in the worst accident in CTA history, the Chicago Loop Derailment, where the train operator ignored a cab signal and rear ended a Ravenswood train parked at the nearby State/Lake station, killing 11 and injuring nearly 200 people. Operating fleet Trains on the Lake‚ÄìDan Ryan Route consisted of the 2000-series cars from 1969 to 1983; the 2200-series cars from 1969 to 1983; the 2400-series cars from 1983 to 1993; and the 2600-series cars from 1984 to 1993.

Liberal Party Jeremy Thorpe became leader of the Liberal Party in January 1967. The 1970 general election was disappointing as the Liberals lost six of their twelve seats in the House of Commons. But in the February 1974 general election, they increased their number of MPs to 14 and won over 6 million votes (19.3%), their best result in terms of seats since 1945 and in terms of the percentage of the popular vote won since 1929. Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath had won four fewer seats than Labour's Harold Wilson but did not resign. Instead, he entered into negotiations with Thorpe and the Ulster Unionist Party to form a coalition government. Thorpe, never enthusiastic about supporting the Conservatives, demanded major electoral reforms in exchange for such an agreement. Unwilling to accept such terms, Heath resigned and Wilson returned for his second spell as Prime Minister. As Wilson did not have an overall majority, he was widely expected to call another election before too long; he did so in September 1974. Thorpe anticipated a turning point in the Liberals' fortunes and campaigned under the slogan \\"one more heave\\", aiming for a complete breakthrough with entering a coalition a last resort. The phrase is attributed to advertising agent and Liberal parliamentary candidate Adrian Slade. The slogan was memorable, but considered uninspiring. Future Liberal Party leader David Steel called the whole campaign \\"a slightly less successful re-run of February.\\" In the general election, the Liberals received over 700,000 fewer votes and returned 13 MPs, down one. The result was a great disappointment to Thorpe and marked the beginning of the end of his tenure as leader. He was ousted as Liberal leader in May 1976 after the Thorpe affair, which concerned his alleged homosexual relationship with Norman Scott and the shooting of Scott's dog by a hired gunman. Thorpe was later tried and acquitted of conspiracy and incitement to murder, but lost his seat at the 1979 general election. David Dutton wrote in A History of the Liberal Party since 1900 that, \\"By adopting the phrase 'one more heave', the party tried to encourage the belief that its ambitions were eminently realizable [sic]. In practice, however, the task of retaining the fickle support that had been attracted in February, while at the same time persuading another substantial tranche of voters to desert their traditional preferences, was enormous. Even an extra 5 per cent of the total vote, evenly distributed across the country, would only have produced six extra MPs.\\" Labour Party Ahead of the 1992 general election, the Conservatives were campaigning for a fourth straight election victory, having recently replaced Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister with John Major. But with Labour consistently albeit narrowly ahead, with the economy approaching recession and the Conservatives racked by internal divisions, Labour under Neil Kinnock were expected to win. However, the Conservatives confounded the polls and won the election, receiving the most votes at any general election in history, although they returned only 10 more MPs than they needed for a majority. Kinnock announced his resignation and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John Smith was elected to succeed him in July 1992. Under Smith, Labour adopted what many saw as a cautious approach, seeking to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government. This approach was dubbed, sometimes pejoratively, \\"one more heave\\". It exasperated some, with the Fabian Society saying in 1993 that \\"one more heave\\" meant doing nothing, changing nothing and \\"sleepwalking to oblivion\\". Labour \\"modernisers\\" like Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson considered such an approach too timid and were critical of it in private and later. However, others argued that this is an unfair description of Smith's approach. Former cabinet minister and former Labour Deputy Leader Roy Hattersley wrote in 1997 that Smith was \\"determined to modernise the party. But he wanted to bring the old principles up to date, not to replace them. He looked for intellectual improvements not ideological alternatives.\\" The electoral success of such an approach was never tested as Smith died of a heart attack in 1994. Blair won the subsequent leadership election; he and Brown re-branded the party New Labour and then won the 1997 general election in a landslide. Labour strategist Peter Hyman wrote in his memoirs in 2005, \\"I could sense too, and share, the exasperation that some had for the 'one more heave' strategy that John Smith employed, the assumption that if Labour held tight it would win next time round. I think he was right, we would have won, but to sustain us in power and lock out the Tories, possibly for a generation, required far more brutal changes.\\" Numerous political commentators used the phrase (often disparagingly) when writing about potential Labour Party electoral strategy following the 2017 general election. The term has also been used to refer to the leadership style of party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

John Fox and General Manager John Elway mutually agreed the organization and Fox should part ways following the game. 2015 season Throughout his first training camp under new head coach Gary Kubiak, Jackson competed against Antonio Smith and Vance Walker for the starting left defensive end role. Defensive Coordinator Wade Phillips employed a 3-4 defensive scheme that moved Demarcus Ware to outside linebacker, vacating his defensive end position. He was named the starting defensive end to start the season, alongside Vance Walker, who was replacing Derek Wolfe, while he served a four-game suspension. During Week 5 against the Oakland Raiders, Jackson recorded six combined tackles and sacked quarterback Derek Carr during a 16-10 road victory. Three weeks later, he collected two combined tackles, deflected a pass, and recorded the first safety of his career in a 29‚Äì10 victory over the Green Bay Packers. He made the safety after tackling tight end Richard Rodgers in the end zone during the fourth quarter. He finished the season with a career-high 45 combined tackles (34 solo), seven pass deflections, five sacks, and a safety in 16 games and starts. The Broncos finished the season atop the AFC West with a 12‚Äì4 record. After defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots, the Broncos went on to play in Super Bowl 50. In the first quarter, Jackson recovered a fumble by Cam Newton that was forced by linebacker Von Miller. The touchdown gave the Broncos an early 10‚Äì0 lead and Jackson went on to record five combined tackles in the Broncos' 24‚Äì10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. =Jacksonville Jaguars= On March 9, 2016, the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Jackson to a six- year, $85.5 million contract with $31.5 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $10 million. 2016 season Under head coach Gus Bradley, Jackson returned to a 4-3 defensive scheme and was named the starting defensive end to start the season. Jackson chose to wear No. 90 after he was unable to receive No. 97 since it was already issued to Roy Miller. During Week 3 against the Baltimore Ravens, Jackson collected two combined tackles and recorded his first sack as a Jaguar on quarterback Joe Flacco in a 19‚Äì17 loss. The following week, he collected a season-high five combined tackles and deflected a pass during a 30‚Äì27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. During a Week 12 matchup at the Buffalo Bills, Jackson made five combined tackles and sacked Tyrod Taylor twice in a 28‚Äì21 loss. On January 1, 2017, he recorded two solo tackles and made two sacks on Colts' quarterback Andrew Luck as the Jaguars lost 24‚Äì20. Jackson finished his first season with the Jaguars with 33 combined tackles (28 solo), 6.5 sacks, and four pass deflections in 16 games and starts. 2017 season Offensive line coach Doug Marrone was hired as the new head coach and opted to maintain defensive coordinator Todd Wash and their 4-3 defense. Marrone chose to switch Jackson from defensive end to defensive tackle to start the 2017 season. He joined a stout defensive line that consisted of Yannick Ngakoue, Dante Fowler Jr., Marcell Dareus, and was headed by Calais Campbell. They adopted the name \\"Sacksonville\\" and became one of the top defensive lines in the league. Jackson started in the season-opener at the Houston Texans and made three solo tackles, deflected a pass, and a sack during a 29-7 road victory. On December 19, 2017, Jackson was named to his first Pro Bowl. Jackson finished the 2017 season with three passes defensed, four forced fumbles, eight sacks, and 40 total tackles as the Jaguars finished with a 10‚Äì6 record and finished atop the AFC South. In the Wild Card Round against the Buffalo Bills, Jackson started the game and recorded a sack and tackle in the 10‚Äì3 victory. Pro Football Focus gave Jackson an overall grade of 86.4, which ranked 17th among all qualifying interior defensive linemen. 2018 season When asked about his prediction for the Jaguars in 2018, Jackson stated that \\"I'm callin' it, 16-0. I don't think anybody can beat us as long as we stay healthy and do what we're supposed to do.\\" During Week 4 against the New York Jets, Jackson made his first sack of the season when he sacked rookie quarterback Sam Darnold in the 31‚Äì12 win. Prior to the Week 11 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was benched as a result of his poor quality of play. Without Jackson starting, the Jaguars lost to the Steelers by a score of 20‚Äì16. During Week 16 against the Miami Dolphins, Jackson made his first sack in almost three months when he sacked Ryan Tannehill in the 17-7 road victory. In the regular-season finale against the Houston Texans the following week, he made a season-high 1.5 sacks in the 20-3 road loss. Ultimately, Jackson's lofty predictions for the 2018 Jaguars to have a 16‚Äì0 record fell short when they lost to the Tennessee Titans in Week 3 by a score of 9‚Äì6. The Jaguars eventually finished the season with a 5‚Äì11 record and very far from Jackson's goal. On March 8, 2019, Jackson was released by the Jaguars due to salary cap issues. = Philadelphia Eagles = On March 13, 2019, Jackson signed a three-year $30 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. 2019 season During the season-opener against the Washington Redskins, Jackson suffered a foot injury. He was placed on injured reserve on September 10, 2019. =NFL statistics= Regular season { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Season !! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=2Games !! colspan=6Tackles !! colspan=5Interceptions ! colspan=3Fumbles - !

It has its roots in pre-slavery African- American culture, and possibly is based on dance styles originating in Africa. Overview Set de flo' dancing involves drawing a circle on the ground (usually on a dirt floor); dancers are required to not step outside the bounds of the circle, and if they did, they will be disqualified. A caller, usually a fiddler, would call out increasingly complicated dance steps, which the dancers would have to perform without a misstep. Competitors could dance solo, or as couples. The expression \\"set de flo'\\" apparently refers not to the drawing of the circle on the ground, but to a particular dance step where the dancer would stomp on the floor when they began dancing, a move that appeared to set the floor in place for the dancer. When couples competed, the man and woman would bow to one another at the start of the dance. The woman would place her hands on her hips, then her male partner would grin and roll his eyes, then they would begin dancing, it was somewhat humorous to the spectators that watch the couples dance. Couple dances developed some common steps. For example, couple dances often began with the woman placing her foot on the knee of her male partner, and he would tie her shoelace. Strutting was an element always present in set de flo' dancing. \\"Water dances\\" were sometimes present in set de flo'. A water dance is a dance competition during which a dancer keeps a glass or pail of water balanced on his or her head while dancing and tries not to spill the water (see Head-carrying). The Cakewalk and the Buck dance were other dances that could include water dance elements. Comparisons to other dance styles The use of a caller to announce the dance steps is a common one in West Africa. Worshippers of Shango, the god of thunder and fire, may dance with a flaming pan balanced on top of their head. The Egbado Yoruba also have a ritual of challenging dancers by having them dance with a cup of water or a terracotta figurine balanced on their head. The set de flo' dances evolved into other styles, such as the Cakewalk. The common moves included the ritual of a male partner tying his female partner's shoelace at the start of their dance; the award of a cake for the competition winner; and some common dance moves mimicked farm work such as hoeing or swinging a scythe. Competitions Competitions between African- American dancers were at the core of set de flo' dancing. Of the many styles of African-American dancing during the slavery era, most were called simply \\"jigs\\" by whites, using the term for Irish dances that had a similarly strong rhythm. Poor Irish immigrants to the Carolinas introduced jig dancing to the region, and other whites saw the slave dance styles as similar. Set de flo' was among these \\"jig\\" dances. Slave owners would sometimes arrange dance contests between their slaves and slaves from other plantations. The slave owners would bet on the outcome. Slaves, and post-slavery African-American dancers, would compete among themselves with set de flo'.

Recorded at Riverside Studio whilst on a break from Show of Hands, the album is a double album, with disc one, Songs, containing cover versions of songs, whilst disc two, Instrumentals, consists almost entirely of Beer's arrangements of traditional, instrumental pieces. An eclectic array of instruments, influences and guest musicians feature on the album. It was released in May 2005 by Hands on Music, before an altered re-release occurred in 2008 which features the music on one disc instead of two and a different typeface on the artwork. The album was critically acclaimed, with praise given to Beer's musicianship, skill and singing voice. Due to him returning to Show of Hands later in the year, it would take Beer a decade to release a follow-up album, Plays Guitar and Fiddle. Sings a Bit. (2015). Background In the early 2000s, Devon-based folk musician Phil Beer formed the Phil Beer Band whilst on hiatus from his successful duo with Steve Knightley, Show of Hands, and recorded two limited edition studio albums with the band, Mandorock and Once in a Blue Moon. However, his priorities with Show of Hands had prevented him from recording a solo album for some time. After Show of Hands were busy recording two separate albums in 2003, The Path and Country Life, and touring in 2004, the duo took a brief break in 2005 which allowed Beer to record a new solo album. Naming the album Rhythm Methodist as a reference to his methodist upbringing,Living Tradition CD review of Phil Beer - Rhythm Methodist He recorded the album at Riverside Studio, and described it as a \\"bootleg production\\" due to its live, low-key sound and release.Phil Beer - Rhythm Methodist (CD, Album) at Discogs The original version of the album rendered the album title as RHYThM METhODIST.Liner notes. Music The violin played on the album is a Jacob Stainer model. Rhythm Methodist is a double album, with the first disc, Songs, containing cover songs and the second disc, Instrumentals, containing instrumentals, all but one of which are traditional.Biog  Phil Beer Phil Thomas of Living Tradition said that, on Songs, Beer \\"has been let loose with all the 'toys' at his disposal and nobody to gainsay him.\\" Artists covered on the disc include Bob Dylan, Steely Dan and Jackson Browne via Jimmy Cliff. Thomas said that \\"each song has his individual stamp on it and I reckon these arrangements were a labour of love.\\" The disc opens with his cover of Dylan's \\"Old Riley\\", which Beer described as \\"one of Dylan's 'trad' songs\\" that was taught to him by Ashley Hutchings.Rhythm Methodist liner notes. Beer and Hutchings had originally recorded the song together with The Albion Band on their 1990 album. The idea to cover Jim Webb's \\"obscure\\" song \\"All My Loves Laughter\\" was originally suggested by Beer's occasional collaborator Chris While to another of his collaborators, Deb Sandland, for her album Semers Water, but Beer liked it and \\"kept it for himself\\". Beer had long wanted to record a Steely Dan cover, and \\"the rain came as if to order\\" as he covered their song \\"Fire in the Hole\\". The fifth track is Gloucestershire poet Frank Mansell's poems, \\"The Holy Brook\\", set to music written by Beer's old friend, singer-songwriter Johnny Coppin. His cover of Jimmy Cliff's \\"Limbo\\" was the second time he recorded the song, after Show of Hands had recorded it for Out for the Count (1991), although his solo version was described by Beer as being closer to The Neville Brothers' interpretation of the song. The a cappella rendering of Browne's \\"Our Lady of the Well\\" as a duet with Deb Sandland, who adds her \\"dulcet tones\\". After his cover of the traditional song \\"Abroad for Pleasure\\" is Beer's cover of The Band's epic \\"Acadian Driftwood\\", described by Thomas as \\"six minutes or so of real passion.\\" According to Thomas, disc two, Instrumentals, \\"has some interesting arrangements of a variety of mostly traditional tunes.\\" Beer plays almost all the instruments on the disc, with cameo appearances from Steve Crickett and Nick Quarmby. The disc opens with \\"Gloucester Hornpipe/Off to California\\", the first part of the piece being a tune Beer learnt from Paul Burgess of the Old Swan Band, whilst the second part is a ceilidh standard. \\"Vive L'Amour/Masters of This Hall\\", also a traditional piece, is a Breton tune Beer learnt from Johnny Coppin, who himself learnt it from Pierre Bensusan. \\"Alex Patterson's Return\\", Beer's only written piece on the album, celebrates Alex Patterson's return from an expedition to the east. \\"Varso Vienna\\" is a ceilidh tune whilst \\"Lizzie's Set\\" is a jig and a reel featuring, as the title suggests, Lizzie Wescott on fiddle. Beer's version of Linda Thompson's \\"Telling Me Lies\\", recorded several years prior to the album at The Patterson Family Farm before being \\"finally laid to rest\\" by its inclusion on the album, features rare slide guitar playing from Beer. \\"Mampy Moose/Brilliant Pebbles/Philip Brunels\\" is a live set featuring Gareth Turner on diatonic fiddle; the first two parts of the piece were written and recorded by English reggae/folk band E2, whilst \\"Philip Brunels\\" comes from Quebec. The album closes with \\"Flowers of the Forest/When This Bloody War Is Over\\", the first part being a traditional tune learnt in Fairport, whilst the second part is a gospel hymn he had learnt to play in a Methodist chapel many years prior. The words of the songs are from the trenches of World War I, and Beer re- recorded the song with Show of Hands for their Centenary of the outbreak of World War I-commemorating album Centenary: Words & Music of the Great War (2014).Centenary track listing. Release Rhythm Methodist was released on 2 May 2005 by independent record label Hands on Music, co-founded by Beer in 1995 for Show of Hands releases. The album was released to a positive critical reception. Phil Thomas of The Living Tradition was very positive, saying that \\"I feel ashamed to admit that I had forgotten that this man has one of the best voices we have in these islands. This release comes as a timely reminder,\\" and that the album contains \\"terrific musicianship throughout.\\" Beer returned to Show of Hands later in the year, who were releasing their live album As You Were, and in early 2006 the duo recorded their Afro Celt- produced album Witness, released in May of that year.Witness liner notes. The album was re-released on 15 December 2008 by Beer's sporadic record label Talking Elephant, who changed the typeface and spacing of the text on the album cover, and put all the music on one disc instead of two.Talking Elephant edition. After the album was originally released in 2005, Beer would take some time to release another album; in 2010 he released a box set of older material, Box Set One, before finally releasing his next studio album, Plays Guitar and Fiddle. Sings a Bit. in 2015, ten years after Rhythm Methodist.Plays Guitar and Fiddle. Sings a Bit.

Of these, the small but important and ancient Kankali Devi Temple is in good condition, and is usually dated to about 400-425 CE. Unless another building is mentioned, references to \\"the temple\\" below refer to this. Also referred to as Tigowa or Tigwan, the site is about north of Bahuriband between Katni and Jabalpur. The Hindu temple ruins were badly damaged during a colonial era railway project when a contractor demolished and excavated the ruins as building material for the railway project.Cunningham, Alexander (1879). Report of a Tour in the Central Province in 1873-74-75-76 (Vol IX). Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi, pp. 41-47; Of the monuments, the Kankali Devi Temple is most notable and is a Gupta period temple.Momin, A R, The Legacy of G.S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift. 1996.Ramanujan, S R, The Lord of Vengadam: A Historical Perspective. Partridge Publishing, 2014.Prakash, Om, Cultural History of India. 2005. It is one of the oldest surviving Hindu temples, illustrating the formative stages of Hindu temple architecture and the essential elements found in the north Indian style through the modern era. It has a sanctum and an open portico supported on four pillars. The sides of the portico were filled in with walls containing panels at a later period. The sanctuary is, and always was, covered with a flat roof, and is generally very similar to the Gupta period Temple 17 at Sanchi. Despite its name, the temple was probably dedicated to Vishnu, with other elements added later. An image of him as Narasimha is placed inside the sanctum. The portico has an image of the Sheshashai Vishnu (Narayana) and another one of Chamunda (Kankali Devi). Projecting from the front of the portico is a later relief of a seated Vishnu in the yoga asana position with a serpent hood above the head.  Location  The Tigawa temples site is in the eponymous village Tigawa, also called Tigwan, in the Katni district and north of the town of Bahuriband.Census of India 2011: Madhya Pradesh, District Census Book, Katni, Government of India, pages 130-131 It is about west of Katni, north of Jabalpur, east of Bhopal and east of Sanchi and Udayagiri Gupta era monuments. The site is located on a plateau near the Kaimur range of hills, with belts of rocks, where ancient Indians used the local geology to build numerous small dams to harvest rainwater into water reservoirs that locals call jhils. These reservoirs extend from Bahuriband to the north of Tigawa.Cunningham, Alexander (1879). Report of a Tour in the Central Province in 1873-74-75-76 (Vol IX). Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi, pp. 39-43; The local tradition is that there was in the distant past a large city in that location, which would explain the numerous mounds found in their region and when excavated, these mounds have yielded broken pottery and bricks. Alexander Cunningham speculated in 1879 that the Bahuriband (also Bahulaband, about south of Tigawa) may have been the city that Ptolemy transliterated as Tholabana. The name Tigawa (Tigowa, Tigoan, Tigwan) may be derived from \\"Tri-gawa\\" or \\"three villages\\", referring to the neighboring villages of Amgowa and Deori. Local tradition believes that it once had a fort and it was part of a major town named Jhanjhangarh, a suburb of ancient Bahuriband. History The Tigawa site is a relatively small site consisting of a mound measuring about with a length of about . The entire space was covered with over 36 temples of different sizes, the smallest one just built from square cut stones. All these small temples are gone, including some larger standing ones. The square cut stones of these temples were deemed a ready quarry for a railroad project by a late 19th- century railway contractor. They demolished and hauled away about 200 carts of the temple stones. The local villagers submitted a petition to the British official in Jabalpur about 70 kilometers away, to stop the desecration. The official issued a halt order in the 1870s, thus helped preserve the remnants of the site. One stone temple that was too big for the railway project remained untouched, which locals call the Kankali Devi temple and further scholarship identified it to be one of the oldest Hindu temples of the Gupta era. An upset Alexander Cunningham wrote, \\"to the railway contractor the finest temple is only a heap of ready squared stones\\", and \\"the temple of Jerusalem, a ready quarry is to him, and it is nothing more\\". =Date= Relief panels, 1875 photo The Tigawa temple is generally dated to the early 5th-century, though some scholars have dated it to other periods. After comparing it to the hundreds of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments he had seen during his tours, Cunningham argued based on stylistic grounds, iconography, and architecture, that the \\"original [Tigawa] temple undoubtedly belongs to the Gupta period, and cannot, therefore, be later than the fifth century A.D.; but it is more probably as old as the third century\\".Cunningham, Alexander (1879). Report of a Tour in the Central Province in 1873-74-75-76 (Vol IX). Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi, p. 47; In 1957, Mate narrowed the estimate for the Tigawa temple to fourth or fifth century, along with those for Udaigiri and Sanchi.M. S. Mate (1959), The Trivikrama Temple at Ter, Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Vol. 18, (January 1957), pp. 1-4 Percy Brown, in 1959, estimated that the Udaigiri is older, adding that the Sanchi and Tigawa temples were probably completed between 400 and 450 CE. Later scholarship has largely placed the Tigawa temple in the early 5th century, or 400-425 CE range., Quote: \\"The kumbha form is also reflected in the ghatapallava capitals, as seen in the Kankali-Devi temple, in the village of Tigawa, Jabalpur district, Madhya Pradesh dating to 400-425 CE.\\" George Michell calls it \\"late 5th century\\".Michell, George (1990), The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu, p. 192, 1990, Penguin Books, Description The Tigawa site had more than 36 temples, some with sculptures and mandapas. All of these before their destruction, reported Cunningham in 1879, were Brahmanical temples with no sign of any Buddhist or Jain motifs or art. The smallest temples in the range of 4x4 to 6x6 square feet were walled on three sides. Temples bigger than these, but smaller than 12x12 square feet, had a fourth wall with entrance doorways with two pilasters. Those even bigger had a mandapa in front with four pillars. All temples, small or large, had a spire with amalaka on top, confirmed by the remnant ruins. Of these, one named Kankali Devi temple is notable, states George Michell - an art historian and a professor specializing in Hindu architecture, because \\"of the free-standing temples erected during the period of Gupta rule, only those of Sanchi and Tigawa have been completely preserved\\" and these two \\"define clearly the essential architectural scheme of the north Indian temple\\". The Tigawa temple is emblematic illustration of the formative stages of Hindu sacred architecture. =Kankali Devi temple: Vaishnavism tradition= The Tigawa temple square plan and its sanctum's doorway design. The Kankali Devi temple has a square sanctum with a side outside and side inside. The sanctum does not open exactly to the east, but deviates by about 13 degrees, which Cunningham speculated may be intentional and related to \\"one nakshatra\\" (lunar house, Hindu calendar). The temple has an open portico supported on four pillars that projects in front of the sanctum. Both the pillared porch and the sanctum are on a raised plinth, its roof made from horizontal slabs of stone. The pillars of the mandapa are massive, shaped into three symmetric cross sections: a long square sectioned part close to the ground, above it an octagonal and sixteen-edged. Above these is a circular part capped with pot and foliage capitals.KalƒÅdar≈õana: American Studies in the Art of India, Volume 9 of Studies in South Asian Culture, Universiteit van Amsterdam. Instituut voor Zuid-Aziatische Archeologie, Joanna Gottfried Williams, 1981, p.160 On top of the pillars are sculptures of two crouching lions with a tree separating them. The pillars are identical in all respects except the tree: one pillar has a mango tree, another a palm, while the other two trees unclear. The portico was partially walled later, according to Percy Brown. The temple door jambs are intricately carved, in vertical bands that are concentric around the entrance. On top left of the entrance wall is river goddess Ganga holding a water vessel and riding her crocodile vahana, while the top right has river goddess Yamuna also holding a water vessel while riding her tortoise vahana. Goddess Ganga is plucking a fruit from custard- apple tree, while Yamuna is plucking one from a mango tree.Cunningham, Alexander (1879). Report of a Tour in the Central Province in 1873-74-75-76 (Vol IX). Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi, pp. 45-46; A Vishnu relief from the temple narrating the man-boar Varaha legend and the Samudra manthan mythology. The Kankali Devi Temple has reliefs showing Vishnu and generally considered to have been dedicated to Vishnu of Vaishnavism. An image of Narasimha, the man-lion avatar of Vishnu, is placed inside the sanctum. The portico has an image of the Sheshashai Vishnu (Narayana). Another shows Varaha, the man-boar avatar of Vishnu. In front of the temple is a seated Vishnu image in yoga asana position with serpent hood above the head, similar to seated Tirthankaras and the Buddha. The temple also reverentially displays Shaktism and Shaivism themes, including a Chamunda (Kankali Devi) panel which gives the temple its name. On the wall opposite to Kankali Devi is Kali Devi (fierce form of Durga). Cunningham proposed that these Shaiva and Vaishnava reliefs were probably added around the 8th-century.Cunningham, Alexander (1879). Report of a Tour in the Central Province in 1873-74-75-76 (Vol IX). Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi, pp. 46-47; The Kankali Devi temple is similar to the Gupta period Temple #17 at Sanchi, with both illustrating the basic elements of Hindu sacred architecture. The temple style is also similar to the Hindu cave temples of Udayagiri and the Eran temple, both of which can be dated to be from the Gupta era because of the inscriptions found there. A 7th or 8th-century CE Sanskrit inscription mentions the visit of a Umadeva of Kanyakubja, son of Samanya Bhatta, who had come to worship at the temple of Sitabhadra.2.Bhandarkar, D R (1981). Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III. Archaeological Survey of India. New Delhi There are also two inscriptions in Sankha Lipi.Symbol, script, and writing: from petrogram to printing and further, Subrata Gangopadhyaya, Sharada Pub. House, 2004 Significance The Tigawa temple has been one of the Gupta era temples, along with those at Udayagiri, Sanchi, Eran (Airikina), Nachna, Besnagar, Bhumara, Bhitargaon and others, which together helped identify characteristic markers of ancient Hindu temples and to chronologically place Hindu architecture. These were proposed by Cunningham and refined over time. According to a Cunningham proposal, the pre-6th century freestanding and structural Hindu temples were likely closer in appearance to temples made from wood and brick or in caves. The artists would have been inclined to reproduce the older architectural elements, style and designs with new materials of construction such as cut stone, masonry or monolithic rocks. The key markers for ancient Hindu temples, suggested Cunningham, include a square sanctum with a flat roof or simpler spire, an elaborately decorated doorway into the sanctum with parallel vertical bands of carvings, presence of river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna flanking the bottom or top of the sanctum's entrance or the main temple, the use of bosses on capitals similar to those found in Buddhist stupas, and the presence of pillars with massive square capitals. According to Cunningham, another indicator of an ancient Hindu monument is that the temple is not exactly aligned to the east but displaced by between 5 and 15 degrees from a cardinal direction or aligned in other direction, which may have happened to match certain luni-solar calendar calculations or because the standardization of the direction happened a bit later.SK Saraswati, Temple Architecture in the Gupta Age, Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Volume 8, pages 146-158; SK Saraswati (1941), The Origins of the Medieval Temple Styles, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 5 (1941), pp. 227-232 Kramrisch cautions, however, that these guidelines are neither rigid nor imply a sequentially ordered development with abandonment of the style, because a few of these features such as flat or simple superstructure is found in temples dated between the 5th and 10th centuries. The Kankali Devi temple is also significant for being almost identical in its architecture to Temple 17 at Sanchi. The Sanchi shrine too is dated to the early 5th-century. Given the Kankali Devi temple at Tigawa is at a Hindu site while Sanchi shrine is in a Buddhist site, states George Michell, this demonstrates that there were close links between Hindu and Buddhist architecture in the 5th-century.

Stick dance was a dance style that African‚ÄìAmericans developed on American plantations during the slavery era, where dancing was used to practice \\" military drills\\" among the slaves, where the stick used in the dance was in fact a disguised weapon. Origins To add to the dance element of the practise, other slaves would gather around the competitive fighters. They would clap in rhythm, and sing in a call-and-response style, while one caller led the rest of the crowd. Like the banjo and other instruments, the berimbau was based on African instruments and developed by African-American slaves. An early depiction of slaves performing a stick dance is an 18th-century watercolour painting called The Old Plantation, which is in the collections of The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum in Williamsburg, Virginia. It shows a dozen African-Americans gather in front of two slave cabins, with one stick dancer, and two women dancing with scarves to music of a drummer and a banjoist. The watercolour is believed to have been made of a plantation between Columbia and Orangeburg, South Carolina. Minstrel stick dances The stick dance became a standard part of the minstrel shows performed by African-Americans during the late 19th century. It had an element of humour, where the dancer would shuffle onto the stage dressed as an elderly African-American man using a cane, and then suddenly use the cane to perform energetic acrobatic capoeira dance moves.

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 14‚Äì15, 1912 resulted in an inquiry by a subcommittee of the Commerce Committee of the United States Senate, chaired by Senator William Alden Smith. The hearings began in New York on April 19, 1912, later moving to Washington, D.C., concluding on May 25, 1912 with a return visit to New York. There were a total of 18 days of official investigation. Smith and seven other senators questioned surviving passengers and crew, and those who had aided the rescue efforts. More than 80 witnesses gave testimony or deposited affidavits. Subjects covered included the ice warnings received, the inadequate number of lifeboats, the handling of the ship and its speed, Titanics distress calls, and the handling of the evacuation of the ship. The subcommittee's report was presented to the United States Senate on May 28, 1912. Its recommendations, along with those of the British inquiry that concluded a few months later, led to changes in safety practices following the disaster. Background The sinking of , a trans-Atlantic passenger liner owned and operated by the White Star Line, occurred in the early hours of April 15, 1912 while the ship was on its maiden voyage from Southampton, United Kingdom, to New York City, United States. The sinking was caused by a collision with an iceberg in the North Atlantic some 700 nautical miles east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Over 1500 passengers and crew died, with some 710 survivors in Titanics lifeboats rescued by a short time later. There was initially some confusion in both the USA and the UK over the extent of the disaster, with some newspapers at first reporting that the ship and the passengers and crew were safe. By the time Carpathia reached New York, it had become clear that Titanic, reputed to be unsinkable, had sunk and many had died. Official inquiries were set up in both countries to investigate the circumstances of the disaster. Formation The opening day of the inquiry at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, with J. Bruce Ismay being questioned When news of the disaster reached Senator William Alden Smith, he saw an opportunity to establish an inquiry to investigate marine safety issues. Smith, who was a Republican Senator for Michigan, had previously investigated railroad safety issues and had sponsored many of the safety and operating regulations passed by Congress to govern the operations of the American rail industry. He realized the need for rapid action if a US inquiry was to be possible before the surviving passengers and crew dispersed and returned home. He first attempted to contact US President William Howard Taft, but was told by the President's secretary that no action was intended. Despite this, Smith took the initiative and on April 17, 1912 he addressed the Senate and proposed a resolution that would grant the Committee on Commerce powers to establish a hearing to investigate the sinking. Smith's resolution passed, and fellow Senator Knute Nelson, chair of the Commerce Committee, appointed Smith as chair of a subcommittee to carry out the hearings. The following day Smith met with President Taft, who had just received the news that his friend and military advisor Archibald Butt was not on the list of survivors. Taft and Smith arranged additional measures related to the inquiry, including a naval escort for Carpathia to ensure no-one left the ship before it docked. That afternoon, Smith, fellow senator and subcommittee member Francis G. Newlands, and other officials, traveled by train to New York, planning to arrive in time to meet Carpathia as it docked on the evening of 18 April 1912. It was already known that J. Bruce Ismay, chairman and managing director of White Star Line, had survived, and the intention was to serve subpoenas on Ismay and the surviving officers and crew, requiring them to remain in the United States and give testimony at the inquiry. Smith and his colleagues boarded Carpathia and informed Ismay that he would be required to testify before the subcommittee the following morning. The hearings began on 19 April 1912 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, and later moved to Washington, D.C., where they were held in the Russell Senate Office Building. Committee Seven senators served on the subcommittee, with three Republicans and three Democrats in addition to Smith as chair. The other six senators were Jonathan Bourne (Republican, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (Republican, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (Democrat, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (Republican, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (Democrat, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate and liberal wings of the two parties. Questioning was carried out by various members of the committee at different times, rather than all seven senators being present at all times. However, the work of the committee was very much dominated by Smith, who personally conducted the questioning of all of the key witnesses. This caused some tension among the members of the committee and made him a number of enemies, as it was interpreted as an attempt to seize the limelight. It resulted in some members of the committee only attending the hearings infrequently as there was little for them to do. Testimony Witnesses at the Senate inquiry During 18 days of official investigations (punctuated by recesses), testimony was recorded from over 80 witnesses. These included surviving passengers and crew members, as well as captains and crew members of other ships in the vicinity, expert witnesses, and various officials and others involved in receiving and transmitting the news of the disaster. The evidence submitted varied from spoken testimony and questioning, to the deposition of correspondence and affidavits. Subjects covered included the ice warnings received, the inadequate (but legal) number of lifeboats, the handling of the ship and its speed, Titanics distress calls, and the handling of the evacuation of the ship. Surviving officials, crew and passengers who were questioned or provided evidence included J. Bruce Ismay (who was the first to be questioned); the most senior surviving officer, Charles Lightoller (Second Officer on Titanic); the lookout who sounded the alarm, Frederick Fleet; the surviving wireless operator, Harold Bride; and first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV. Those that testified from among the captains and crew of other ships included Arthur Rostron (Captain of Carpathia), Harold Cottam (wireless operator on Carpathia), Stanley Lord (Captain of ), and Herbert Haddock (Captain of ). Expert witnesses, speaking or corresponding on subjects such as radio communications, iceberg formation, and newspaper reporting, included Guglielmo Marconi (Chairman of the Marconi Company), George Otis Smith (Director of the United States Geological Survey), and Melville Elijah Stone (General Manager of the Associated Press). Others called to give testimony included Phillip A. S. Franklin, Vice President of International Mercantile Marine Co., the shipping consortium headed by J. P. Morgan that controlled White Star Line. The inquiry concluded with Smith visiting Titanics sister ship Olympic in port in New York on 25 May 1912, where he interviewed some members of the crew and inspected the ship's system of watertight doors and bulkheads, which was identical to that of Titanic. Report and conclusions The final report was presented to the United States Senate on May 28, 1912. It was nineteen pages long, with 44 pages of exhibits, and summarised 1,145 pages of testimony and affidavits. Its recommendations, along with those of the British inquiry that concluded on 3 July 1912, led to many changes in safety practices following the disaster. The report's key findings were: * A lack of emergency preparations had left Titanics passengers and crew in \\"a state of absolute unpreparedness\\", and the evacuation had been chaotic: \\"No general alarm was given, no ship's officers formally assembled, no orderly routine was attempted or organized system of safety begun.\\" * The ship's safety and life-saving equipment had not been properly tested. * Titanics Captain Edward Smith had shown an \\"indifference to danger [that] was one of the direct and contributing causes of this unnecessary tragedy.\\" * The lack of lifeboats was the fault of the British Board of Trade, \\"to whose laxity of regulation and hasty inspection the world is largely indebted for this awful tragedy.\\" * The SS Californian had been \\"much nearer [to Titanic] than the captain is willing to admit\\" and the British Government should take \\"drastic action\\" against him for his actions. * J. Bruce Ismay had not ordered Captain Smith to put on extra speed, but Ismay's presence on board may have contributed to the captain's decision to do so. * Third-class passengers had not been prevented from reaching the lifeboats, but had in many cases not realised until it was too late that the ship was sinking. The report was strongly critical of established seafaring practices and the roles that Titanics builders, owners, officers and crew had played in contributing to the disaster. It highlighted the arrogance and complacency that had been prevalent aboard the ship and more generally in the shipping industry and the British Board of Trade. However, it did not find IMM or the White Star Line negligent under existing maritime laws, as they had merely followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an \\"act of God\\". Senator Smith made a number of recommendations for new regulations to be imposed on passenger vessels wishing to use American ports: * Ships should slow down on entering areas known to have drifting ice and should post extra lookouts. * Navigational messages should be brought promptly to the bridge and disseminated as required. * There should be enough lifeboats for all on board. * All ships equipped with wireless sets should maintain communications at all times of the day and night. * New regulations were needed to govern the use of radiotelegraphy. * Adequate boat drills were to be carried out for passengers. * Rockets should only be fired by ships at sea as distress signals, and not for any other purposes. The presentation of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards the end of his speech, Smith declared: > The calamity through which we have just passed has left traces of sorrow > everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will > typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of > state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest > due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these > heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the > humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk > will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those > who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house > of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place > permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth > of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning > motive for better things. Rayner's closing words drew applause from the assembled Senators: > The sounds of that awe-inspiring requiem that vibrated o'er the ocean have > been drowned in the waters of the deep, the instruments that gave them birth > are silenced as the harps were silenced on the willow tree, but if the > melody that was rehearsed could only reverberate through this land \\"Nearer, > My God, to Thee,\\" and its echoes could be heard in these halls of > legislation, and at every place where our rulers and representatives pass > judgment and enact and administer laws, and at every home and fireside, from > the mansions of the rich to the huts and hovels of the poor, and if we could > be made to feel that there is a divine law of obedience and of adjustment, > and of compensation that should demand our allegiance, far above the laws > that we formulate in this presence, then, from the gloom of these fearful > hours we shall pass into the dawn of a higher service and of a better day, > and then, Mr. President, the lives that went down upon this fated night did > not go down in vain. Smith proposed three pieces of legislation: a joint resolution with the House of Representatives to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Captain Rostron of the Carpathia; a bill to re-evaluate existing maritime legislation; and another joint resolution to establish a commission to enquire into the laws and regulations on the construction and equipment of maritime vessels. The report's recommendations on the regulation of wireless telegraphy were implemented in the form of the Radio Act of 1912, which mandated that all radio stations in the US be licensed by the federal government, as well as mandating that seagoing vessels continuously monitor distress frequencies. The existing Wireless Ship Act of 1910 was also amended to add new regulations governing how wireless telegraphy aboard ships was to be managed. Reactions \\"The Importance of being Earnest\\", satirical cartoon by David Wilson attacking Smith's chairmanship of the inquiry The inquiry was heavily criticised in Britain, both for its conduct and for Smith's style of questioning, which on one occasion saw him asking Titanics Fifth Officer Harold Lowe what an iceberg was made of (Lowe's response was \\"Ice, I suppose, sir\\"). Even though Titanic was (indirectly) owned by an American consortium, International Mercantile Marine, the inquiry was seen as an attack on the British shipping industry and an affront to British honor. The subcommittee was criticized for having the audacity to subpoena British subjects while Smith himself was ridiculed for his apparent naivet√©. He became the butt of music-hall jokes and was given the nickname of \\"Watertight\\" Smith. London's leading music-hall venue, the Hippodrome, offered him $50,000 to perform there on stage on any subject he liked (an offer that was not taken up) and the press mocked Smith relentlessly as a fool, an ignoramus and an ass. One satirical song of the time went: > I'm Senator Smith of the USA, Senator Smith, that's me! A big bug in the > enquiry way, Senator Smith, that's me! You're fixed right up if you infer > I'm a cuss of a cast-iron character. When I says that a thing has got ter > be, That thing's as good as done, d'yer see? I'm going to ask questions and > find out some If I sit right here till kingdom come ‚Äì That's me! Senator > Smith of the USA. Many newspapers published scathing editorial cartoons depicting Smith in unflattering terms, such as the Irish cartoonist David Wilson's illustration of \\"The Importance of being Earnest\\", published by The Graphic. Such views crossed party and class divides. The Morning Post asserted that \\"a schoolboy would blush at Mr. Smith's ignorance\\" while the Daily Mirror denounced him for having \\"made himself ridiculous in the eyes of British seamen. British seamen know something about ships. Senator Smith does not.\\" The Graphic claimed that the Senator had \\"set the whole world laughing by the appalling ignorance betrayed by [his] questions.\\" The Daily Telegraph suggested that the inquiry was fatally flawed by employing non-experts, which had \\"effectively illustrated the inability of the lay mind to grasp the problem of marine navigation.\\" Similar concerns were expressed by the Daily Mail, which complained that \\"it has no technical knowledge, and its proceedings ... show a want of familiarity with nautical matters and with the sea\\", and by the Evening Standard, which criticized the inquiry for being \\"as expert in investigating marine matters as a country magistrate's bench might have been.\\" Smith's own antecedents attracted ridicule; the Daily Express called him \\"a backwoodsman from Michigan\\", which the newspaper characterized as a state \\"populated by kangaroos and by cowboys with an intimate acquaintance of prairie schooners as the only kind of boat\\". His closing speech to the Senate came in for particularly harsh criticism from the British press, which termed it \\"bombastic\\", \\"grotesque\\" and \\"a violent, unreasoning diatribe.\\" The British government was also hostile towards the inquiry. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, spoke of his contempt for the way the senator had put the blame in a \\"denunciatory\\" fashion on the inadequate regulations implemented by the British Board of Trade. The British Ambassador to the United States, James Bryce, demanded that President Taft should dissolve the committee and refused to recognise its jurisdiction. Some British writers, however, applauded the inquiry. G. K. Chesterton contrasted the American objective of maximum openness with what he called Britain's \\"national evil\\", which he described as being to \\"hush everything up; it is to damp everything down; it is to leave the great affair unfinished, to leave every enormous question unanswered.\\" He argued that \\"it does not much matter whether Senator Smith knows the facts; what matters is whether he is really trying to find them out.\\" The Review of Reviews, whose founder William Stead was among the victims of the disaster, declared: \\"We prefer the ignorance of Senator Smith to the knowledge of Mr. Ismay. Experts have told us the Titanic was unsinkable ‚Äì we prefer ignorance to such knowledge!\\" The American reaction was also generally positive. The New York Herald published a supportive editorial commenting: \\"'Nothing has been more sympathetic, more gentle in its highest sense than the conduct of the inquiry by the Senate committee, and yet self-complacent moguls in England call this impertinent ... This country intends to find out why so many American lives were wasted by the incompetency of British seamen, and why women and children were sent to their deaths while so many British crew have been saved.\\" The American press welcomed Smith's findings and accepted his recommendations, commending the senator for establishing the key facts of the disaster.

The inquiry was overseen by High Court judge Lord Mersey, and was held in London from 2 May to 3 July 1912. The hearings took place mainly at the London Scottish Drill Hall, at 59 Buckingham Gate, London SW1. There were a total of 42 days of official investigation. Lord Mersey and the various counsels, assessors and experts in marine law and shipping architecture, questioned White Star Line officials, government officials, surviving passengers and crew, and those who had aided the rescue efforts. Organisations represented by legal counsels included shipping unions and government organisations. Nearly 100 witnesses testified, answering more than 25,000 questions. The questioning resulted in a report that contained a detailed description of the ship, an account of the ship's journey, a description of the damage caused by the iceberg, and an account of the evacuation and rescue. The final report was published on 30 July 1912. Its recommendations, along with those of the earlier United States Senate inquiry that had taken place in the month after the sinking, led to changes in safety practices following the disaster. Background The sinking of the , a trans- Atlantic passenger liner operated by White Star Line, occurred in the early hours of 15 April 1912 while the ship was on its maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York, United States. The sinking was caused by a collision with an iceberg in the North Atlantic some 700 nautical miles east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Over 1500 passengers and crew died, with some 710 survivors in Titanics lifeboats rescued by a few hours later. There was initially some confusion in both the United States and the UK over the extent of the disaster, with some newspapers at first reporting that the ship and the passengers and crew were safe. By the time Carpathia reached New York, it had become clear that Titanic, reputed to be unsinkable, had sunk and many had died. Official inquiries were set up in both countries to investigate the circumstances of the disaster. Formation Attorney General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, presented the inquiry with a list of 26 key questions to be answered When news of the disaster reached the UK government the responsibility for initiating an inquiry lay with the Board of Trade, the organisation responsible for British maritime regulations and whose inspectors had certified Titanic as seaworthy before her maiden voyage. On 22 April 1912, Sydney Buxton, President of the Board of Trade, asked Lord Loreburn, the Lord Chancellor, to set up a commission of inquiry. The Lord Chancellor appointed Lord Mersey as the inquiry's President. The resultant hearings took place from 2 May to 3 July 1912, mainly at the London Scottish Drill Hall, on Buckingham Gate. The location was chosen for its large size, as sizeable audiences were expected, but turned out to have terrible acoustics that made it hard to hear what was going on. The last two days were held at Caxton Hall, Westminster due to the Scottish Drill Hall being booked for an examination. To assist the inquiry, Titanics builders Harland and Wolff provided a half-model of the ship showing its starboard side, next to which was mounted a large map showing the North Atlantic shipping lanes and locations of sea ice. The Attorney General for England and Wales, Sir Rufus Isaacs, gave the commission a list of 26 questions concerning issues such as Titanics construction, how she had been navigated and the ice warnings received prior to the collision with the iceberg. A further question was added after the inquiry began concerning the role played by , which had been in the vicinity of Titanic but had not rendered assistance to the sinking ship. Legal personnel Those carrying out the questioning and representation included legal counsels, and assessors and experts in marine law and shipping architecture. The five assessors consisted of Rear Admiral the Honourable Somerset Gough-Calthorpe; Captain A. W. Clarke of Trinity House; Commander Fitzroy Lyon of the Royal Naval Reserve; Professor John Harvard Biles, an expert on naval architecture at the University of Glasgow; and Edward Chaston, an Admiralty senior engineer assessor. Also involved were the Attorney General, Sir Rufus Isaacs (representing the Board of Trade), Robert Finlay (representing the White Star Line), Thomas Scanlan, and Clement Edwards. Organisations represented included shipping unions and government organisations. The maritime law firm Hill Dickinson represented the White Star Line. Other counsel (several of whom were also Members of Parliament) included Hamar Greenwood and Henry Duke, the solicitor-general John Simon (also representing the Board of Trade), the prime minister's son Raymond Asquith, Sidney Rowlatt, and Edward Maurice Hill. Organisations with counsel representing or watching on their behalf included the Board of Trade, the White Star Line, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union of Great Britain and Ireland (see National Union of Seamen), the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, the British Seafarers' Union, the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, the Marine Engineers' Association, the National Union of Stewards (see National Union of Ship's Stewards), and the builders of the ship, Harland and Wolff. Organisations with representatives watching the proceedings were Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers, Canadian Pacific Railway, and Leyland Line.Several of the unions were later consolidated and merged. Two (the Imperial Merchant Service Guild and the Marine Engineers' Association) form part of the history of Nautilus UK: Testimony Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon's testimony was a highlight of the inquiry, attracting many society figures During 36 days of official investigations (spread over two months), testimony was recorded from nearly 100 witnesses in the form of answers to set questions that the process was designed to answer. These questions, combined with sometimes extensive cross-examination, resulted in over 25,000 questions being recorded in the official court records. With a cost of nearly ¬£20,000 (¬£ at today's prices), it was the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time. Those testifying included surviving passengers and crew members, as well as captains and crew members of other ships in the vicinity, expert witnesses, government officials, and White Star Line officials and ship designers. Surviving crew members who testified included the most senior surviving officer Charles Lightoller (Second Officer on Titanic), the lookout who sounded the alarm Frederick Fleet, the surviving wireless operator Harold Bride, and the ship's baker Charles Joughin. Those from other ships who gave evidence at the hearings included Harold Cottam (wireless operator on Carpathia), Stanley Lord (Captain of Californian), Arthur Rostron (Captain of Carpathia), and J. B. Ranson (Captain of ). Expert witnesses included Guglielmo Marconi (Chairman of the Marconi Company), and explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. Others called to give testimony included Harold Arthur Sanderson, UK Vice President of International Mercantile Marine Co., the shipping consortium headed by J. P. Morgan that controlled White Star Line. White Star Line officials that testified included J. Bruce Ismay (Chairman and Managing Director) and Charles Alfred Bartlett (Marine Superintendent). From Harland and Wolff, evidence was given by Alexander Carlisle (Naval Architect). Carlisle was the brother-in-law of the shipyard's chairman Lord Pirrie, and together with Pirrie was initially responsible for the design of the Olympic-class liners (including Titanic). Carlisle had retired in 1910, and like Pirrie had not travelled on the maiden voyage of Titanic. The lead designer on board had been Thomas Andrews, Pirrie's nephew, who went down with the ship. The only passengers to testify, other than Ismay, were Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon and his wife Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon. The questioning of the Californians crew and the Duff Gordons were seen as highlights of the inquiry. The failure of Californian to go to the rescue of the sinking Titanic, which had been disclosed by the American inquiry, was already controversial and became even more so with the testimony of Captain Lord and his officers. Lord's claims and explanations were contradicted by his officers and he was portrayed by them as an intimidating and somewhat tyrannical figure. Although Lord appeared only as a witness and was not accused of wrongdoing, as one historian of the Titanic disaster has put it, \\"the image created in the mind of the public ever since has been of the Californian's officers standing idly on the bridge, so thoroughly intimidated by their captain that they would rather watch another ship sink than run the risk of facing his wrath.\\" The testimony of the Duff Gordons, who had been accused of misconduct for their actions in leaving Titanic aboard a lifeboat with 40 seats but only 12 passengers, attracted the largest crowds of the inquiry. Many notable society figures attended, including Margot Asquith, the wife of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith; the Russian Ambassador to London, Count Aleksandr Beckendorf; several Members of Parliament, and various aristocrats. Testimony was given relating to the fire which had begun in Titanics coal stores approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its maiden voyage out of Southampton. Little note was taken of it.Titanic doomed by fire raging below decks, says new theory ‚Äì The Independent. 12 April 2008. Retrieved 3 January 2017.

Report and conclusions The final report was published on 30 July 1912. The lines of questioning at the inquiry had resulted in a detailed description of the ship, an account of the ship's journey, a description of the damage caused by the iceberg, an account of the evacuation and rescue. There was also a special section devoted to the circumstances of Californian. The report found that Titanics sinking was solely the result of colliding with the iceberg, not due to any inherent flaws with the ship, and that the collision had been brought about by a dangerously fast speed in icy waters: > The Court, having carefully inquired into the circumstances of the above > mentioned shipping casualty, finds, for the reasons appearing in the annex > hereto, that the loss of the said ship was due to collision with an iceberg, > brought about by the excessive speed at which the ship was being navigated. It also found that the lookout being kept was inadequate given the navigational hazards Titanic faced, and that the ship's officers had been complacent. There were too few lifeboats available and they had not been properly filled or manned with trained seamen, though they had been lowered correctly. The inquiry concluded that Californian \\"could have pushed through the ice to the open water without any serious risk and so have come to the assistance of the Titanic. Had she done so she might have saved many if not all of the lives that were lost.\\" The Board of Trade's representative suggested to Lord Mersey that a formal inquiry should be held into Captain Lord's \\"competency to continue as Master of a British ship\\" but no action was taken against him due to legal technicalities. The Board of Trade was criticised for its inadequate regulations, notably the failure to ensure that enough lifeboats were provided and that crews were given proper training in their use. The Duff Gordons were cleared of wrongdoing but it was made clear that they should have acted more tactfully. In contrast to the American inquiry, the Mersey report did not condemn the failures of the Board of Trade, the White Star Line or Titanics captain, Edward Smith. The report found that although Smith was at fault for not changing course or slowing down, he had not been negligent because he had followed long-standing practice which had not previously been shown to be unsafe (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives). It concluded that Smith had merely done \\"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position.\\" However, the practice itself was faulty and \\"it is to be hoped that the last has been heard of this practice. What was a mistake in the case of the Titanic would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future.\\" The report's recommendations, along with those of the earlier United States Senate inquiry that had taken place in the month after the sinking, led to changes in safety practices following the disaster. Reactions The report was well received by the British press. The Daily Telegraph commented that although \\"technically speaking, the report is not the last word, but in practice it would probably be treated as if it were.\\" The Daily Mail opined that it was \\"difficult to suppose that any court which had to inquire into the responsibility of the owners of the ship would disregard the expression of opinion of Lord Mersey and those who sat with him ... The report having, in effect, acquitted them of all blame, it is not likely that any attempt will be made hereafter to establish the contrary.\\" Others were more critical. In his memoirs, Charles Lightoller pointed out the inquiry's conflict of interest: \\"A washing of dirty linen would help no one. The Board of Trade had passed that ship as in all respects fit for the sea ... Now the Board of Trade was holding an inquiry into the loss of that ship ‚Äì hence the whitewash brush.\\" Titanic historian Donald Lynch notes the consequences: \\"Apart from protecting itself, the [Board of Trade] had no interest in seeing the White Star Line found negligent. Any damage to White Star's reputation or balance sheet would be bad for British shipping ‚Äì and there was considerable potential for both. Negligence on the part of the shipping company might pave the way for millions of dollars in damage claims and lawsuits that would tie up the courts for years, possibly break the White Star Line, and result in the loss of much of Britain's lucrative shipping traffic to the Germans and the French.\\" Stephanie Barczewski notes the contrast between the approaches taken by the American and British inquiries. The British inquiry was much more technical, \\"the more learned and erudite of the two\\", while the American inquiry's report was a reflection of a comparatively poorly managed inquiry that had frequently allowed itself to get sidetracked. However, the American report took a much more robust stance on the failures that had led to the disaster. As Barczewski puts it, it \\"bristles with criticisms of established seafaring traditions and of the conduct of the Titanics builders, owners, officers and crew\\", and conveys \\"righteous indignation\\" and a \\"passion to right the wrongs\\" done to the victims of the disaster and to prevent any recurrence. The authors of the two reports took markedly different interpretations of how the disaster had come about. The American report castigated the arrogance and complacency that had led to the disaster and held Captain Smith, the shipping industry and the Board of Trade culpable for their failures. The British report emphasized that \\"the importance of this Enquiry has to do with the future. No Enquiry can repair the past.\\" Notes Bibliography  External links *SOS Titanic, details of a TV dramatisation of the inquiry (BBC) Further reading *Complete transcripts of the inquiry and report are available at British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry (Titanic Inquiry Project) *Mersey, Lord (1999) [1912].

Designed by Seabrook and Fildes, it was the first fire station commissioned by the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade to embrace a Modernist ideology.Christine Phillips, 'Planting the seeds of Modernism: The work of Seabrook and Fildes 1933-1950', Master of Architecture (by thesis), Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, The University of Melbourne, 2007. Seabrook's father, who was Chairman of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade at the time, was no doubt influential in ensuring his son's practice was awarded the contract, the first of twelve the firm designed which included the stations at Camberwell (1938), Brighton (1939) and Windsor (1941).Philip Goad, 'Melbourne Architecture', Revised and Expanded Edition, The Watermark Press, 2009, p. 150. Description The Brunswick Fire Station incorporates 2 vehicle spaces with 2 large doors facing Blyth Street, a watch room, toilets and offices. At the time of construction the station boasted state-of-the-art fire fighting equipment and alarm systems. Brunswick Fire Station - NorthEast Perspective The planning reflects a functionalist sensibility,Richard Apperly, Robert Irving and Peter Reynolds, 'A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture', Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1989, p. 184. where the station's various activities are organised into zones that are expressed externally in a series of interlocking cubic forms. The building's keynote vertical element, for instance, conceals the main staircase and boldly protrudes beyond the fa√ßade, bearing the station's flagpole. Although telephony had long surpassed spotters as the means of detecting blazes, this tower is evocative of pre- Federation days when stations such as Smith and Johnson's Eastern Hill Fire Station in East Melbourne (1891‚Äì1893) were invariably positioned on high ground,Philip Goad, 'Fire Stations', in The Encyclopaedia of Australian Architecture, Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 249-251. and denotes the building's important and enduring civic presence. The accommodation for the firemen and their families was originally located in two separate two-storey residential blocks of flats at the rear of the main building. Sizeable garden courtyards were positioned between the flats and station, providing abundant northern light to the residences. Ground floor planter boxes further enhanced the connection between home and landscape. With the introduction of shift work, the need for resident fire fighters disappeared. Only the southernmost residential block remains, located on the corner of Burchett and Barningham Streets. Key Influences and Design Approach The most noteworthy exponents of the Inter-War Functionalist style in Australia were young architects who in their formative years had made trips to Europe.Donald Leslie Johnson, 'Australian Architecture 1901-51: Sources of Modernism', Sydney University Press, 1980, p. 93. Norman Seabrook was one such professional, and along with his practice partner Alan Fildes, played an invaluable, but often unstated role in the development of Modernist architecture in Melbourne. Brunswick Fire Station - Brick Detail In the decades prior to Seabrook and Fildes' first fire station project, polite Georgian revivalist designs were the norm for the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade, often resembling overblown houses featuring squat red brick walls and hipped roofs with prominent eaves. The Brunswick design irrevocably broke this mould. Numerous historians point to Willem Dudok's Hilversum Town Hall as the major influence on Seabrook and Fildes' aesthetic, particularly in the firm's adoption of De-Stijl decompositional techniques. This is clearly evident is Brunswick station's use of prismatic forms, horizontal window banding, cantilevered hoods over fenestrations, flat roofs and minimal ornamentation save for the striking sans serif lettering above the garage doors. Cream brickwork is also strongly associated with Dutch Modernism, however here its usage has special significance, as this colour was first introduced to the local market by Brunswick brick maker John Glew in the 1850s. In the 1930s eclecticism pervaded apartment design in Melbourne, with practitioners such as Howard Lawson, Roy Grounds and Taylor, Soilleux and Overend seeking to overcome Australia's long standing prejudice against high-density living by promoting economical but contemporary solutions that adopted variously, and often in the one project, Modernist, Moderne, Georgian revivalist and Californian inspired styles. Seabrook and Fildes, however, stuck resolutely to their Modernist principles, incorporating the ideas of Frank Lloyd Wright and the International Style in their flat designs with elements such as sizable expanses of glass, built-in furniture and direct engagement with the surrounding landscape.Christine Phillips, 'Seabrook & Fildes', in The Encyclopaedia of Australian Architecture, Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 620-621. The Brunswick site's two rectilinear apartment blocks were orientated in the zeilenbau style, that is parallel to each other and aligned at right angles to Burchett Street. Dating back to the German municipal estates of the 1920s,Miles Glendinning and Stefan Muthesius, 'Tower Block: Modern Public Housing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland', Yale University Press, 1994, p. 39. the aim of this layout was to provide maximum sunlight, airflow and quietude, with equal access to the grounds for all inhabitants. The logical simplicity of the Brunswick design influenced numerous contemporaries, as seen at Winbush's fire station in Kew (1941) and Henderson and Cuthbert's fire station in Forrest, Canberra (1939).

(1996). Effects of lexical frequency and syntactic complexity in spoken-language comprehension: Evidence from the auditory moving-window technique. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 22(2), 324-335. Ferreira and colleagues built the paradigm in order to address the scarcity of (fluent) spoken-language comprehension literature versus the robustness of that for visual-word processing. Auditory moving-window can be used to assess indirectly the processing load of a sentence: this processing load is assessed by an analogue of reaction time within the paradigm (discussed below). Reaction times within the paradigm are sensitive to at least word frequency and garden path effects. The paradigm has been used in the study of syntactic processing in the study of aphasic patients. One such study suggests that many aphasic patients retain their abilities to process syntactic structures on- line. Further, evidence suggests that Expressive aphasics have a degraded ability to process complex syntax on-line, whereas Receptive aphasics are impaired only after on-line comprehension concludes Caplan, D., Waters, G. (2003). On-line syntactic processing in aphasia: Studies with auditory moving window presentation. Brain and Language, 84, 222-249. Application of the auditory moving-window The auditory moving-window paradigm, because of its similarity to the eye tracking paradigm, has a broad range of applications. It is at least sensitive enough to detect frequency effects on comprehension: low frequency words had a greater IRT and DT than high frequency words, suggesting a relative difficulty of lexical access. Further, it is sensitive to garden path effects Technical details ;Stimuli preparation Because one of the aims of the auditory moving-window is to investigate fluent speech, the paradigm is several steps more complex than simple auditory word-by-word presentation: *To begin, a speaker records an unbroken sample of speech. *Following this, the researcher using the paradigm artificially segments the sample, using an audio-editing software such as Computerized Speech Laboratory.http://www.kayelemetrics.com/index.php?option=com_product&controller;=product&Itemid;=3&cid;[]=11&task;=pro_details **The segment size is contingent on the target of the research. In Ferreira et al. (1996), segments follow phrasal boundaries. The practical limit seems to be clausal at the poorest resolution, verbal at the finest: the auditory moving-window is meant to capture \\"fluent\\" speech, which in natural production includes at least the paralinguistic information of prosody. *After the speech sample has been segmented, the researcher may choose to regularize variables such as amplitude or sampling rate of the segments. **A completed sample may read out as the following, where \\"^\\" indicates a segment bound: ***George ^ looked ^ for ^ a new ^ chest ^ for ^ his European ^ clothes. *At the end of a sample, the researcher may elect to insert a single tone to indicate the end of the sample, as sentence-final prosody differs across sentence types and it may not be clear to the subject that the sample has in fact ended. ;Stimuli presentation The presentation of a prepared sample depends on what software is being used. What follows is an abstraction of the general strategy. *The software loads a sample during the experiment. *The participant in the study initiates the sample presentation by pressing a \\"pacing button\\": this introduces the first segment. *Each subsequent button press initiates the next segment. The software may be programmed such that segments must conclude before the next is available. **The software monitors the time between button presses. This is the Inter-Response Time (IRT). The actual duration of the segment is subtracted from the IRT to yield the Difference Time (DT). This DT is the variable of interest. ;Analytical logic The auditory moving-window is roughly analogous to an eye tracking task presented in the auditory modality. The eye tracking variable of interest that is thought to be closest to the DT is that of fixation duration. They are held to be directly related: a greater DT is correspondent to a greater fixation duration. Several eye-tracking studies use fixation duration as an indirect measure of processing load: a greater fixation duration is correspondent to a greater processing load . The same applies to DTs.

Primarily known as a songwriting and record production team, the duo has also released various bodies of work as recording artists, including their debut album, What Dreams Are Made Of, released in November 2015. They are best known for the single \\"Locked Away\\" featuring Adam Levine. In 2007, the duo signed with Geffen Records and American singer Akon's KonLive Distribution. During their time there they released a series of mixtapes with the primary title, PTFAO (Put the F*ckin' Album Out), a reference to the fact that their then- debut album Wake the Neighbors had not been given a release date. In 2011, the duo were released from their contract with KonLive and subsequently founded Rebelution Records. In 2014, they signed a record deal with RCA Records and Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records.

They grew up in the Oswald Harris Court Projects and graduated from Charlotte Amalie High School. As children, the brothers were backup dancers for a local all-girl rap group. They frequently practiced various genres of music and received support from their parents. In 2000, the two left the Virgin Islands to pursue their music career in Miami. They initially performed under the name 2Ekwip. They had limited success on the Miami nightlife scene. During this time, Theron worked for Kroger and Timothy for Party City. They moved back to St. Thomas in 2005. =Career beginnings and record deal (2006-09)= In 2006, the duo sold their first song, \\"The Rain,\\" which appeared on American singer-songwriter Akon's triple platinum-selling album Konvicted.

In 2011, the duo parted ways with KonLive and founded their own label imprint called Rebelution Records. They intended to release their debut album, Free At Last, on their own label, but the release date was later pushed back to 2009. Despite the tumult with their record labels, Rock City continued writing songs for other artists during this period. They penned Rihanna's \\"Man Down\\" and Justin Bieber's \\"Run Away Love.\\" In 2013, the duo wrote numerous Billboard Hot 100 songs, including Miley Cyrus' \\"We Can't Stop\\", Rihanna's \\"Pour It Up\\", and Ciara's \\"I'm Out.\\" \\"Pour It Up\\" appeared on Rihanna's album Unapologetic, which won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards.

Promoted with the tagline \\"this really is modern folk music\\", it featured fifteen different, original tracks by different UK violin-playing folk musicians, and was designed to represent the fiddle and folk scene in the United Kingdom. It was released in April 1999 on the Hands on Music label which Beer co-founded. The album was critically acclaimed, with reviewers impressed by the eclectic array of musicians and sounds, the skill and the crossover appeal. It has since been considered a precursor to the acclaimed Feast of Fiddles compilation series. The album was re-released in late 2001 at the same time as when \\"Ridgeriders\\" In Concert was released. In February 2011, it was announced Phil Beer had remastered The Fiddle Collection and hoped to re-release it by the summer, however, as of October 2016, this release has not occurred. Background and concept Since Beer's collaboration with Steve Knightley, Show of Hands, became his musical priority in 1991, the duo had built up gradual but sure success throughout the rest of the decade. In 1996 they played a sold out performance at the Royal Albert Hall, later released as their best-selling album to date Live at the Royal Albert Hall (1996), and followed it with Dark Fields (1997) and a limited edition set of traditional folk music covers, Folk Music (1998). As a result of their busy schedule, the duo took some time apart in 1999 to undergo solo, side-projects before they would regroup in 2000. Knightley recorded his first solo album, Track of Words, whilst Beer recorded two different collaboration albums. The first of them was a various artists album project in which Beer, a skilled fiddle player, would gather many of the United Kingdom's finest fiddle players. With Beer acting as the producer to the music on the album, and contributing some recordings of his own, the album would be the first time such an album of folk fiddle players had been created. Each song would be by a different folk musician, and would feature original material. Beer enlisted Phil Beer, Chris Leslie, John McCusker, Gris Sanderson, occasional collaborator Paul Burgess, Chris Wood, Tom Leary, Michael Burnham, Dave Swarbrick, Ben Van Wede, Ric Sanders, Peter Knight, occasional collaborator Paul Downes, Welsh celtic rock band The Bluehorses, Gareth Turner and Ian Carr to feature on the album. Composition Phil Beer playing the fiddle (pictured in 2009). The Fiddle Collection begins with Beer's own recording, \\"The Falmouth Packet/Penmere Halt\\", a two-part piece consisting of two \\"Cornish\\" tunes Beer had written to commemorate his childhood holidays in Falmouth. He dedicated the track to his parents for their musical influence, and would later re-record \\"The Falmouth Packet\\" with Knightley for Show of Hands' album Witness (2006).Witness liner notes. The track is followed by \\"While You Sleep/The Willow Arch,\\" a two-part piece by Fairport Convention's Chris Leslie, a member of Feast of Fiddles; the first conveys the stillness of home after a long night drive from a show, whilst \\"The Willow Arch\\" was built from withies over the entrance to a campfire at a woodcraft folk get together. Battlefield Band fiddle player John McCusker's \\"Wee Michael‚Äôs March/Joe's Tuxedo\\" follows, McCusker having come to Beer's attention after his self- titled solo album became one of Beer's favourite albums of recent times. The first part was written for his nephew \\"Wee\\" Michael McCusker, whilst the second part relates to an \\"accident involving sound engineer Joe Rusby and a Tuxedo\\". The fourth track is another Beer recording, \\"The Old Court Waltz\\", which was the last piece of music to be recorded at \\"The Old Court\\" near Gloucester, whilst the fifth track is Gris Sanderson's \\"Uptodden?\\", written in memory of being unsure as to which Galloway Hill Sanderson was \\"standing on at the time\\". Paul Burgess, described by Beer as \\"a veritable repository of English tunes and author of many more that have almost passed into tradition\\", features with \\"Redlegs/The Tipputs\\". Beer noted that \\"he plays with a unique attack and feel that comes from countless energetic dances at which he has performed with outfits such as the celebrated Old Swan Band. These two tunes are a fine example of his individual style.\\" Beer's occasional collaborator Chris While features with the first of two songs on the album, \\"The Burning Babe\\".Liner notes. The second half of the album starts with Feast of Fiddles and Albion Morris member Tom Leary's \\"The Yearning Heart/The Monkey Tree,\\" followed by \\"Herr Rolorffs Farewell\\" by fiddle maker and player Michael Burnham. Beer's next solo recording appears next, shanty \\"The Yankee Clipper\\", which had played with The Albion Band and Show of Hands with several times, including on the latter's live album Show of Hands Live (1992).Show of Hands Live track listing. \\"New South Wales\\" by David Swarbrick, described by Beer as \\"probably the most influential fiddler in Britain,\\" appears next followed by two original jigs by Ben van Wede, \\"The Stone On The Gate/Jiggered.\\" \\"Jiggered\\" pays homage to the many squeeze box players that he has played with over the years and the first tune was written for the album. Fairport Convention's Ric Sanders appers with \\"As Yet\\", inspired by a trip to Slovenia with a middle section written after watching a television program about the 1960s Russian experiments with the Ekranoplus high speed 'ground effect' vehicles. Beer described the song as containing \\"a wonderful mix of folk, rock, and jazz influence from one of Britains great fiddlers.\\" Peter Knight's \\"The Gemini Cadenza\\" was not recorded exclusively for the album and instead taken from his then-latest solo album The Gemini Cadenza. Beer then appears with his sporadic collaborator Paul Downes with the latter's \\"lovely tune\\" \\"Dancing with Nancy\\". The album closes with a song from Welsh celtic rock band, 'The Old Conwy\\", which sees the band depart from their electric sound and record \\"unplugged and in a contemplative mood.\\" Release and reception The Fiddle Collection was released on 12 April 1999 by Hands on Music, the independent label that Beer had co-founded in 1995 with Knightley to release Show of Hands releases; it was the ninth release on the label.Album notes. A print advertisement advertised the album as \\"the finest players in the UK brought together in a special collection celebrating the fiddle in folk music.\\"http://www.folkicons.co.uk/fidcoll.JPG It was also promoted with the tagline \\"This really is modern folk music.\\" The album was released to a very favourable reception from critics. The Ledge said that \\"if you only buy one more CD this year this should be it‚Ä¶ the carefully considered running order has the whole thing hanging together like few compilation albums do‚Ä¶ sheer quality and an absolute must for every collection\\", whilst Shreds & Patches said of the album \\"Phil Beer is to be congratulated on this work. It is a unique collection‚Ä¶ The tracks follow nicely after each other, the presentation is lavish, the notes copious and the photography good. A ‚Äòwannagetit‚Äô for fiddlers, an education for some unaware of the fiddle‚Äôs capability.\\" Folk Spins said the album was \\"a lovely and very varied new collection, compiled by Phil Beer and featuring him alongside a dozen other notables.\\" Folk on Tap said the album was \\"performed by the very best of the British scene‚Ä¶ as well as some delightful accompaniment‚Ä¶ this is an excellent album,\\" and Folk On said that \\"some of the very best in the land on here‚Ä¶ there are sublime moments‚Ä¶ and the album is studded with guest appearances from all over the musical spectrum‚Ä¶‚Äô Folk in Kent too commended the album, saying \\"WELL DONE! There is much here for fiddle players and listeners alike ‚Äì roll on volume 2\\". The album has proven influential, and is often considered a precursor to the acclaimed Feast of Fiddles compilation series. Beer noted it was \\"the first time such an album of folk fiddle players had been created\\". It was not the only album Beer released in 1999, as his collaborative Ridgeriders album with members of The Albion Band was released in September,Ridgeriders liner notes. however, it was the only volume of The Fiddle Collection, as there was never a second volume produced.

Set between 1989 and 1991, the film is a dramatization of the Hillsborough disaster, which saw 96 football supporters lose their lives at Hillsborough in Sheffield. Background In April 1989, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The match was played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield but was abandoned shortly after the match had started when it became clear that the fans packed in to the Leppings Lane end of the ground were being crushed against fencing. 94 fans died that day, with a 95th victim dying a few days later, and the final death toll reaching 96 in 1993. Production In 1995, two women who had lost children in the disaster asked McGovern if he would write their story. He began by interviewing the families of the victims, and became so angry at the unfolding story that he brought in writer Katy Jones to verify that his writing was not skewed in any way. The film was produced by Granada Television for ITV and aired for the first time on 5 December 1996. Since then, it has been repeated four times: 10 years after the disaster (15 April 1999), 20 years after the disaster (17 April 2009), on 14 September 2012 after the report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel was published, and on 1 May 2016 after the conclusion of the second inquest which ruled that the 96 victims were unlawfully killed. Though filmed after the death of the final victim (Tony Bland) who died in March 1993, after being in a coma for nearly four years, the time setting of the film concluded in 1991 when the death toll stood at 95.

The Independent Television Commission praised Granada for the drama in its annual programme review, describing it as 'arguably the most powerful drama on the screen in 1996'. It won the BAFTA Television Award in 1997 for Best Single Drama, Best Editing and Best Sound. In 2000, the British Film Industry placed Hillsborough at number 54 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.

This disorder has been reviewed by the DSM-5 work groups, who have decided that it be called Persistent complex bereavement disorder and placed it in the chapter on Conditions for Further Study in the new DSM-5.Conditions Proposed by Outside Sources  APA DSM-5  Description  Complicated grief is considered when an individual‚Äôs ability to resume normal activities and responsibilities is continually disrupted beyond six months of bereavement. Six months is considered to be the appropriate point of CGD consideration, since studies show that most people are able to integrate bereavement into their lives by this time.Bonanno GA, Wortman CB, Lehman DR, et al.

(2011): *The person has been bereaved (i.e. experienced the death of a loved one) for at least six months *At least one of the following symptoms of persistent, intense, acute grief has been present for a period longer than is expected by others in the person‚Äôs social (or cultural) environment: **Persistent intense yearning or longing for the person who died **Frequent intense feelings of loneliness, or that life is empty or meaningless without the person who died **Recurrent thoughts that it is unfair, meaningless or unbearable to live when a loved one has died, or a recurrent urge to die in order to find (or join) the deceased **Frequent preoccupying thoughts about the person who died; e.g. thoughts or images of the person intrude on activities or interfere with functioning *At least two of the following symptoms are present for at least one month: **Frequent, troubling rumination about the circumstances (or consequences) of the death (concerns about how or why the person died, about not being able to manage without their loved one, thoughts of having let the deceased person down, etc.) **Recurrent feeling of disbelief or inability to accept the death **Persistent feeling of shock; feeling stunned, dazed or emotionally numb since the death **Recurrent feelings of anger or bitterness related to the death **Persistent difficulty trusting or caring about other people, or envy of others who have not experienced a similar loss **Frequently experiencing pain (or other symptoms) that the deceased person had, hearing the voice of (or seeing) the deceased person **Experiencing intense emotional or physiological reactivity to memories of the person who died or to reminders of the loss **Changes in behavior due to avoidance (or its opposite, excessive proximity-seeking‚Äîrefraining from going places, doing things, or having contact with things that are reminders of the loss; feeling drawn to reminders of the person‚Äîwanting to see, touch, hear or smell things to feel close to the person who died). Both symptoms may coexist in the same individual. *Duration of symptoms and impairment of at least one month *Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other major areas of functioning, where impairment is not explicable as a culturally appropriate response  Incidence  CGD is an atypical grief response, occurring only in a minority of the bereaved population.

(similar to PTSD-targeted psychotherapy). Other methods of psycho-pharmacological treatment are under investigation.  CGD and bereavement-related adjustment disorder Although the DSM-5 work groups have suggested using \\"adjustment disorder, specified as bereavement-related\\" to diagnose complicated grief, opposing opinions contend that this does not fit the nature of CGD and is an inappropriate diagnosis for those suffering from CGD.Shear, M. K. (2011). BEREAVEMENT AND THE DSM5. Omega-Journal of Death and Dying, 64(2), 101-118. doi:10.2190  Ethical considerations  = Medicalizing (or misdiagnosing) normal grief = Following the DSM-5 work groups‚Äô recommendation to remove the bereavement-exclusionary criteria,Wakefield and First, 2012 Wakefield JC, First MB. Validity of the bereavement exclusion to major depression: does the empirical evidence support the proposal to eliminate the exclusion in DSM-5?. World Psychiatry 2012; 11: 3-10. there is some concern that the addition of CGD may increase the possibility of medicalizing the grieving process. However, proponents of CGD claim that with proper clinical assessment only those with abnormally incapacitating levels of grief will receive this diagnosis and benefit from treatment. Furthermore, despite the possibility of diagnosis-related stigma the clinical necessity for treatment is a priority for those suffering from CGD. = Cultural norms for grief = An individual‚Äôs culture plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is necessary to consider cultural norms before reaching a CGD diagnosis. There are cultural differences in expected emotional levels, their expression and duration; the external symptoms of grief differ in non-Western cultures, presenting increased somatization.Horwitz, A.

History The club started in 1973 and played in the Sunshine Coast and Gympie Districts AFL. After winning back to back premierships in 1987 and 1988 the club transferred to the QAFL for the 1990 season. The switch was not a success as Morningside kicked a record score against them - Morningside 47.28.310 defeated Caloundra 1.3.9. After returning to the Sunshine Coast in 1991 it won the premiership, and followed up again in 1992. In 1993, the league shut down and the Sunshine Coast clubs played in the Brisbane AFL. Caloundra lost the 1993 Grand final to Maroochydore by eleven points. In 2000, a major reorganization of football in southern Queensland saw Caloundra placed in division one.

The tradition of making rag dolls in Mexico extends back to the pre-Hispanic period with the making of rag dolls reaching its peak in the 19th century. Allende's first doll was made when her sister was about to turn fifteen. For quincea√±era celebrations in Xochimilco, it is customary to give the girl her ‚Äúlast doll‚Äù as a means of marking her transition from child to adult. Allende decided to make this doll herself, using sewing skills taught to her by her grandmother. Soon after, she began to make dolls for her friends and family, and the attention they received prompted her to think of selling them. Allende started her own small business called Retacitos (Scraps) in 2002 involving other members of her family, such as her at that time husband Sinh√∫e Lucas, along with contracting various single mothers in her area to work. She sells directly to the public only on Saturdays at the Art Bazaar in the San √Ångel neighborhood. Her other sales are mainly to stores and museums. She receives a number of custom orders including making dolls that look like famous people such as Frida Kahlo and even those that look like the purchaser. Allende states that her goal is to revive the craft of doll making but in a more modern form. She generally sticks to forms familiar to Mexican concepts of cultural identity such as lucha libre wrestlers, angels, traditional rag dolls, horses, mermaids, rabbits, etc. She has been recognized as an authentic Mexican craftswoman since 2010 by the government of Mexico City, her work has been exhibited in various museums and cultural events and has won the 3rd place at the VI Bienal Internacional de Arte Textil Contempor√°neo WTA (2012) and the 1st place in the toys category at the Gran Premio de Arte Popular of FONART (2006) among other distinctions. History Dolls at the San √Ångel stand The tradition of making dolls in Mexico stretches back to Teotihuacan, with finds of small clay dolls with movable limbs. While toys have been made since the pre Hispanic period, most archeological samples are in poor condition because of the natural materials they were made with. The making of handcrafted dolls continues in various communities, especially indigenous ones in Chiapas, Jalisco, Michoac√°n, Oaxaca and Quer√©taro using various materials, with those made from cloth and ceramic dominating. The making of rag dolls in Mexico reached its peak in the 19th century. Ana Karen's grandmothers taught her how to knit and embroider. Her great grandmother taught her and her sister, Lorena, how to paint and otherwise decorate their toys to personalize them. Her Mother encouraged them to create their own toys out of any material they could lay hands on. From this, she took an interest in painting and drawing, and with her parents‚Äô support took lessons during her teens. Her grandparents lived in the center of Coyoacan, which allowed her to meet many of the artisans which sell there, learning how to work with wire. Ana Karen Allende was taught to sew by her grandmother, using a Singer sewing machine from the end of the 19th century. It was with this machine that she created her first two dolls. When she moved to Xochimilco, she became involved in the local culture through participation in weddings, religious festivals, quincea√±eras and other events. Her younger sister was about to turn fifteen and in Xochimilco it is customary for a girl at her quincea√±era celebration to receive her last doll from her godparents, a sign of passing from childhood to adulthood. These dolls have hallmarks of the rite of passage such as shoes with heels instead of flats. Allende decided to make this doll for her sister herself. This was the beginning of her research on the tradition of making rag dolls in Mexico. She soon began to make dolls as gifts for family and friends. The attention that the dolls received led to the idea of selling them. One of her first items made for sale were stuffed rabbits. She began to make and sell rag dolls and stuffed animals beginning in 2002 with the target market of making the ‚Äúlast dolls‚Äù of quincea√±eras. Her then mother-in-law worked in cartoner√≠a and introduced her to many craftsmen in the city expanding her customer base. Since then, she has developed her craft to revive the tradition of making Mexican style handcrafted dolls and stuffed animals but with modern innovations. Creations Face of one of the dolls She says that commercial rag dolls and stuffed animals are impersonal and merely copies. Her creations are unique with no two exactly alike. The most popular figures include those from lucha libre such as Blue Demon, Santo, and El Rayo de Jalisco, as well as those Mexico's past such as aluxes, chaneques, calacas and Mayan guardian figures. Her works include images of painter Frida Kahlo and creatures reminiscent of alebrijes, as well as traditional rag dolls, fairies, horses, centaurs, mermaids and much more. However, she says that except for custom orders, all the pieces made are based on Mexican culture and tradition in some way. So images are not that of popular culture from outside of Mexico but of figures which have been known to the Mexican handcrafts and folk art tradition. She has also made dolls that look like famous people and of her own clients. One of her creations for Retacitos was a doll made to look like singer Cecilia Toussaint, which was used to open one of the singer's shows. She did a life-sized one of writer Julio Cort√°zar complete with his cat and a cigarette. When she receives an order of this type, she does research on the person to know more about them. Retacitos Since 2003, Allende has sold her wares each Saturday at the San √Ångel art and handcrafts bazaar located at the San Jacinto Plaza. Her work is marketed under the name of Retacitos (scraps), a small family enterprise trademarked since 2005. They also work with contractors for many of the pieces, who are generally single mothers, who can then work at home and take care of their children. The name originated in the fact that most households have small bits of cloth, string and other items which can be used to make dolls and other creative items. Much of this is wasted as many people no longer know how to sew. The business has focused on getting their merchandise in wider circulation in Mexico City, Canc√∫n and Nayarit. She has also worked with the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana and ITESM CCM to develop the business. Retacitos sells directly to the public only in San Angel on Saturdays. Other sales are through stores such as those in Cacha Estudio, Garros Galer√≠a the Museo de Arte Popular and the Museo Mexicano del Dise√±o, Museo del Juguete the Museo de Estanquillo and others. Exhibitions and prizes Allende and husband Sinhu√© Lucas at opening of exhibit at the Centro Cultural Mexiquense. Allende and her team have exhibited Retacitos project work in various states of Mexico and in some countries of the world, in museums, art galleries, fairs, cultural centers, stores with cultural interests. They have also been interviewed in various media, both print and television and internet. With the support of a government agency called FONDESO, the enterprise has participated in exhibitions at the World Trade Center and in various Ferias de Econom√≠a Popular (Popular Economy Fairs). Her work has been exhibited in countries such as Germany, Canada, France, Switzerland, Spain, Uruguay and Guatemala. Allende's work has been shown in the Museo Dolores Olmedo and the Museo de Arte Popular, and at festivals such as the Festival de las Almas in Valle de Bravo. For this festival a set of dolls related to Mexico's Day of the Dead were created. The exhibit was called ‚ÄúDesde el m√°s all√° con alma de trapo‚Äù (From the beyond with a soul of rags), which consisted of about fifty pieces including mobiles, toys and other pieces at the Museo Joaqu√≠n Arcadio Pagaza. They related to death and Mexican popular culture. She had an individual exhibition in honor of International Women's Day at the Carranza Cultural Center called \\"Retazos con Mirada de Mujer\\" (Scraps with the Gaze of a Woman) in March 2012. A cloth work of hers called \\"Yaxch√©, el √°rbol sagrado maya (Yaxch√©, the Mayan sacred tree) is part of the collection of French association Fiber Art Fever, which was also included in an exhibition called \\"M√°gico Textil\\" (Textile Magic) at the Casa Abierta al Tiempo, at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana in Mexico City in May 2011. She won first prize in the toy category at the Gran Premio de Arte Popular FONART in 2006 and is certified by the Consejo de Pueblos y Barrios Originarios del DF city as an authentic Mexican artisan. In 2007, her work was exhibited in the Museo del Estanquillo, which included a meter tall Judas figure and a life sized doll of Frida Kahlo. Today, these pieces belong to writer Iv√°n Restrepo. Her work, ‚ÄúLuchare Por Tus Sue√±os‚Äù (Will Fight For Your Dreams) with a lucha libre theme, earned third place out of sixty entrance at the VI Bienal Internacional de Arte Textil.

Justinian II and the usurpers, 685‚Äì711  Justinian II (685‚Äì711) set in motion a chain of events by embarking on a despotic and increasingly violent course. His policies met with considerable opposition, eventually provoking a rebellion led by Leontios (695‚Äì698) in 695, which deposed and exiled him, precipitating a prolonged period of instability and anarchy, with seven emperors in twenty- two years.Jenkins, Romilly (1966). Byzantium The Imperial centuries AD 610-1071. p. 56 Leontios was popular at first, though the loss of Carthage soon ruined his reputation. John the Patrician led a navy to Carthage, losing in 698. The army feared Leontios, in the same year he was overthrown by Tiberios III (698‚Äì705). Tiberios managed to bolster the eastern frontier and reinforced the defenses of Constantinople, but meanwhile Justinian was conspiring to make a comeback and after forming an alliance with the Bulgars succeeded in taking Constantinople and executing Tiberios. Justinian then continued to reign for a further six years (705‚Äì711). His treatment of Tiberios and his supporters had been brutal and he continued to rule in a manner that was despotic and cruel. He lost the ground regained by Tiberios in the east, and imposed his views on the Pope. However, before long he faced a rebellion led by Philippikos Bardanes (711‚Äì713). Justinian was captured and executed as was his son and co-emperor, Tiberius (706‚Äì711), thus extinguishing the Heraclian line. Justinian had taken the Byzantine empire yet further from its origins. He effectively abolished the historical role of Consul, merging it with Emperor, thus strengthening the Emperors' constitutional position as absolute monarch.  Philippikos Bardanes, 711‚Äì713  Philippikos' rebellion extended beyond politics to religion, deposing the Patriarch Cyrus, reestablishing Monothelitism and overturning the Sixth Ecumenical Council, which in turn alienated the empire from Rome. Militarily the Bulgars reached the walls of Constantinople, and moving troops to defend the capital allowed the Arabs to make incursions in the east. His reign ended abruptly when an army rebellion deposed him and replaced him with Anastasius II (713‚Äì715).  Anastasius II, 713‚Äì715  Anastasius reversed his predecessor's religious policies and responded to Arab attacks by sea and land, this time reaching as far as Galatia in 714, with some success. However the very army that had placed him on the throne (the Opsikion army) rose against him, proclaimed a new emperor and besieged Constantinople for six months, eventually forcing Anastasius to flee.  Theodosius III, 715‚Äì717  The troops had proclaimed Theodosius III (715‚Äì717) as the new emperor, and once he had overcome Anastasius was almost immediately faced with the Arab preparations for the Second Arab siege of Constantinople (717‚Äì718), forcing him to seek assistance from the Bulgars. He in turn faced rebellion from two other themata, Anatolikon and Armeniakon in 717, and chose to resign, being succeeded by Leo III (717‚Äì741) bringing an end to the cycle of violence and instability. It is surprising that the Byzantine Empire was able to survive, given its internal problems, the speed with which the Sassanid Empire collapsed under the Arab threat, and the fact that it was being threatened simultaneously on two fronts. However the strength of the military organization within the empire, and factional struggles within the Arab world enabled it to do so.

Between 29 October 1797 and 12 March 1798, Recovery captured a small French privateer. However, her most significant capture occurred in April. On 17 April 1798 she was under the command of Lieutenant William Ross when she encountered the French privateer schooner Revanche. After an engagement of 45 to 50 minutes, Revanche struck. She was pierced for 12 guns and had 10 mounted. She had a crew of 54 men under the command of Antoine Marin. During the engagement she lost three men killed and nine wounded, four of whom were not expected to recover; Recovery had no casualties.

PNPA was established on August 26, 1977 by the virtue of Section 19, PD 1184 and was tasked to provide tertiary level education to Filipinos aspiring to be officers in the three bureaus of the Department of Interior and Local Government. History In the early 1960s, policemen were hired purely on the basis of personal relations with influential personalities and government officials. City and municipal policemen were after being hired, sworn in, and issued weapons. Despite their lack of knowledge on the police system, they were given the responsibility of safeguarding and protecting the community. The police organization then had no code of conduct. The police service then required neither entry standards nor appropriate training, and had no consistent promotional policies. However, substantial improvements were achieved with the passage of Republic Act 4864 on September 6, 1966, known as the ‚ÄúPolice Act of 1966‚Äù. That law provided for the establishment of the Police Commission and was renamed National Police Commission under the Office of the President of the Philippines. Among the powers, duties and responsibilities of the National Police Commission were to advise the President on all matters involving local police administration, examine and audit the performance, activities and facilities of all local police agencies throughout the country, promulgate a police manual prescribing rules and regulations for the efficient organization, administration, and operation of the local police, including their recruitment, selection and promotion, organize and develop police training programs and operate police training centers, and establish a system of Uniform Crime Reporting. Upon approval of this Police Act, appointment to a local police agency was made by the mayor from the list of eligibles certified by the Civil Service Commission, provided that all appointments were on probationary basis for a period of six months. After that an evaluation and recommendation report for retention or termination by the Chief of Police was required prior to the expiration of the probationary period. The set up was not without its concomitant pitfalls. Training was limited to police service personnel only. Moreover, the system itself lent to locally based, individualized and separate local police units that led to the marked preponderance of political influence and interference over the police forces. Mainly for these reasons, the government opted to integrate all city and municipal police, fire and jail services into a unified national organization. A series of police integration laws culminated on August 8, 1975 in the promulgation of Presidential Decree (PD) 765 constituting the Integrated National Police or INP, providing for the unification of the then separate city and municipal police, fire and jail services in existence within the territory of the Republic. These integrated forces were placed under the operational control of the Philippine Constabulary, by itself an Armed Forces of the Philippines Major Service Command, under the responsibility of the Department of National Defense via the office of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces through the Chief of Constabulary and this served a nucleus to the new organization. The new INP was thus made responsible for public safety, protection of lives and properties, enforcement of laws and maintenance of peace and order within the territorial limits of the Philippines. It had the power to prevent crimes, effect and arrest of criminal offenders and provide for their detention and rehabilitation. It took necessary measures to prevent and control fires, investigate the commission of all crimes and offenses and bring the offenders to justice, all the while to take every necessary step to insure public safety. The power of the administrative supervision and control by the city and municipal governments over their respective local police, jail and fire departments was transferred to the Chief of Constabulary as Director-General of the Integrated National Police in August 1975. The powers and functions of the National Police Commission in the training of policemen was the establishment of the integrated police communication system, the grant of police salary subsidy, and the adjudication and grant of compensation for temporary disability benefits, were transferred to the Integrated National Police, including all appropriate personnel and staff, records and equipment and other resources appertaining thereto, except for the powers and functions vested in and exercised by the NPC. Its powers and functions were the attestation of appointments, examination, investigation, adjudication and review of police administrative disciplinary cases, adjudication and grant of compensation for permanent disability and death benefits, staff inspection and audit, which were extended to the police, fire, and jail components of the INP. = Creation of the academy = Thus, the police, fire and jail services were unified into a single, paramilitary law enforcement organization and the responsibility of training INP personnel was transferred from the National Police Commission on July 1, 1976 to the Integrated National Police Training Command including the 13 regional training centers throughout the country as mandated by Presidential Decree (PD) 765, signed by then-President Ferdinand Marcos. It was the first step towards the creation of an official officer academy for the aforementioned services. On August 26, 1977, PD 1184, otherwise known as the ‚ÄúINP Personnel Professionalization Law of 1977‚Äù, proposed for the creation of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). Immediately after the promulgation of PD 1184, the then chief of Constabulary and concurrently Director General of the Integrated National Police, Major General Fidel V. Ramos (later the President of the Philippines) created a study committee to prepare the corresponding feasibility study and all other prerequisites for the activation of the envisioned PNPA based on PD 1184. Section 19 of said decree provided that ‚Äúthere shall be established in the Integrated National Police a premiere police service training institution to be known as the Philippine National Police Academy for the education and training of the members of the INP.‚Äù In February 1978, General Ramos recommended to Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, then Minister of National Defense, for the activation of the Philippine National Police Academy. As a result of the recommendation, Ministry of National Defense (MND) Order No. 83 was issued on May 25, 1978 activating the Philippine National Police Academy effective June 12, 1978 in line with the national objective to upgrade the law enforcement service in the country. = Opening up to the present = Pursuant to said Ministry Order, General Orders No. 23-P of Headquarters Philippine Constabulary / Integrated National Police dated 23 June 1978 formally announced the activation of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA). The speed that characterized the creation and establishment of the new PNPA was a clear indication of the important role of the institution in the professional development of police officers in the country. In fact, its actual operations began even before its formal inauguration. It conducted entrance examinations for cadetship on May 28 and June 4, 1978 to select the best applicants for its first batch of cadets. When the formal inauguration took place on June 30, 1978, the cadets had to share quarters with the INP Training Command at Fort Bonifacio in Makati for more than two months before it moved to Camp Vicente Lim in Calamba, Laguna as its training venue on August 19, 1978. The apparent infancy of the Academy presented such as lack of formal organization, staffing and a training site. This was, however, resolved by having the Integrated National Police Training Command Headquarters at Fort Bonifacio serve as surrogate organization of the Academy. Simultaneously with the formal establishment of the Academy, the first batch of police cadets was chosen after a rigorous and painstaking selection process ‚Äì including thorough medical and psychiatric examinations that took place on June 30, 1978. Formal academic instructions started on July 17, 1978 with 50 cadets, in formal ceremonies at Fort Bonifacio in the present Philippine Public Safety College grounds. Two years later, 45 of them finally graduated to compose the first Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) graduates ‚Äì the Maharlika Class of 1980, commissioned Police Lieutenants. During its initial years of existence, the Academy limited the admission of its student-cadets to the two-year Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) for qualified members of the Integrated National Police (INP) only. This meant that applicants outside the Integrated National Police (INP) services were not accepted in the cadetship program. When the Philippine National Police Academy was about to complete its third year of existence, the Academy modified its admission requirements to include civilian applicants. On January 15, 1981, less than three years after its establishment, the Academy was granted its Academic Charter through the promulgation of Presidential Decree 1780, otherwise known as ‚ÄúThe Philippine National Police Academy Charter of 1981.‚Äù This decree elevated the Academy to the status as the premier educational and training institution of the country's national police force. Thus, the Philippine National Police Academy was specifically tasked ‚Äúto develop and conduct comprehensive education and training programs with the view of Professionalizing the personnel in every level of command of the Integrated National Police.‚Äù The 1978 Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) curriculum underwent curriculum and training revisions and modifications which brought about the transition from two years to a three-year curriculum, giving emphasis on the separate specialized areas for cadets who would opt for either the police, fire and jail services. In 1991, by virtue of the enactment of Republic Act 6975, otherwise known as the ‚ÄúDepartment of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990‚Äù, the INP became part of a new Philippine National Police, while its fire and jail branches were split, becoming both the Bureau of Fire Protection and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, respectively, all three falling under the Department of Interior and Local Government. The PNPA remained the official joint officer training institution for the public security services of the republic. Finally, on April 13, 1994, the PNPA found its new and permanent home when it moved to Camp General Mariano N. Casta√±eda at Silang, Cavite. By virtue of the provisions of RA6975, The PNPA became a primary component of the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), the institution which was mandated as the premier institution for the training, human resource development and continuing education of all police, fire and jail personnel. It was in January 1997, under the leadership of Police Chief Superintendent Rufino G. Ibay, Jr. that the proposal to revise the Bachelor of Science in Public Safety (BSPS) course into a four-year program was favorably endorsed by then Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President Guillermo P. Enriquez, Jr. that led to its eventual approval by the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) Board of Trustees which is composed of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary as Chairman, the head of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) as members, and the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC) President as ex-officio member. Since the Academy moved to Camp General Mariano N Casta√±eda, Silang, Cavite in 1994 as its new and permanent home, its facilities have been continuously upgraded to make the Academy conducive for learning. Curriculum Police, Jail and Fire Officer candidates attend a 4-year tertiary education course, allowing them to earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Public Safety. Graduating cadets are then commissioned as Inspectors or as a Police Lieutenant, equivalent to a Military First Lieutenant or Lieutenant Junior Grade, in the tri-services of the DILG. Phases of cadetship The Sheep, also known as the plebes or the Fourth Class Cadets, are the newest members of the Cadet Corps who are received during the Reception Rites of the academy.

PNPA academics starts mostly in the month of June after the Incorporation Rites of the plebes. The span of almost 7‚Äì9 months from Incorporation to Recognition Rites of their plebes is the most crucial time of playing the most crucial role as a Third Class men being the direct responsible of leading them.Interview with Police Cadette Maila C Buaquen dated March 26, 2011 The Steward or the Second Class men is a preparatory phase of being a \\"Shepherd\\". Most of the time of Second Class Cadets are concentrated in their academics but at the same time should have control to the Shearers.Kalasag Magazine The Shepherd or the First Class men are the most seniors in the cadet corps. The Ruling Class is the existing most senior class of the year having members who are candidates for graduation. First Classmen are the overseers of the Cadet Corps composed of Cadet Officers, Cadet-In- Charge of Clubs and Organization, and Squad Leaders. They had been chosen by the Outgoing Cadet Officers from the pool of Steward aspirants couple of months before graduation. Upon graduation, the graduates, aside from their degrees, also receive their inspector's commissions within their chosen civil security service. Before their graduation, the First Class cadets in leadership positions hand over these duties to the Second Class cadets, who will take over these in the incoming academic year. Rites The four significant rites a Cadet/Cadette should undergo are as follows: Reception Rites A time-honored tradition for welcoming the chosen few who heeded the call. It is an initiation of the ultimate kind, an ordeal that put into severe test the ambitious' worth and determination. Needless to say, it is a foretaste of the regimental life that lies ahead. Incorporation Rites After the 45-day orientation into the cadetship training termed as ‚Äúbreaking period,‚Äù the rites formally incorporates the new cadets into the activities of the Cadet Corps. The new cadets will now live with their upperclassmen as brothers and sisters in their respective assigned companies. Recognition Rites That simple yet long-awaited, hard-earned and earnestly yearned handshake. To a mammal dwelling in the dim world of plebehood, no experience is far more excellent and glorious than that of clasping with the hands of the immaculate. Recognition is a status. It signifies refinement. Graduation Rites There is no greater victory than to achieve the heights of the Graduation Day. Marking the end of trials and the renaissance of a new life outside the Academy walls... a real image of grandeur realizing cadet's ideals and standing as a role model that sets him apart from the rest, he, being born for greater things honed by honor, discipline and excellence.

Often identified as a pioneer in the study of African cities, Southall is said to have played a significant role in the development of urban anthropology.Jeff Isminger, \\"Doctor Aidan Southall: Urban anthropologist who pioneered the study of African cities\\", The Independent, 13 August 2009. He was married to Christine Obbo, they have a son and a daughter. In 2009, Aidan Southall died. Early life and education Southall, the son of a Church of England parson, was born in Warwickshire, England. Having been born into an impoverished family, Southall was unable to attend boarding school with his friends. He attended a preparatory school, The Perse School in Cambridge, England, at the age of 8 years old. At the age of 11, Southall began his secondary education and eventually worked his way up to Cambridge University where he initially studied Classics. During his last year at Cambridge, at the age of 18, Southall had the opportunity to travel to Jamaica‚Äîhis first exotic experience. Shortly after this, Southall switched over to anthropology after having been persuaded by one of his professors. At Cambridge University, he gained his bachelor's degree in social and cultural anthropology. After graduating in 1942, Southall followed his colleagues to Uganda with the interest of pursuing social anthropology as a career. He eventually attended the University of London where he gained his PhD. Career Southall was given the opportunity to apply for a position at Makerere University in Uganda, and in 1945 he became a professor of social studies at this institution. He had the opportunity to carry out research in that particular area among others in Africa, and eventually conducted fieldwork in Nyanza with a Luo student in Kenya. In Karachuonyo, South Nyanza, being restricted to a short-term study over the span of his vacation, Southall found it difficult to conduct long-term fieldwork and therefore focused on food and lineages. While researching the Luo People, Southall made a short visit to Alur, which became one of his most significant life changing experiences from which he published his first written work called Alur Society. He returned to Alur in 1948 and spent two years there conducting doctoral fieldwork. In the 1950s, Southall became more interested in urban anthropology, and some his work focused on the complexity of developing urban areas. Unlike most anthropologists of his time, Southall was generally interested in urbanisation and the development of African cities in particular. After completing his PhD in 1952 in London, he returned to Makerere as a member of East African Institute of Social Research. During his years at Makerere, he obtained a UNESCO fellowship which slowly contributed to the expansion of his notability and connection through a visit to the United States. There, he encountered other influential researchers, including sociologist Talcott Parsons, who influenced Southall in developing an appreciation for Max Weber's work. As it reflected in his publications, there was a gradual shift in Southall's theoretical position as he began adopting more Marxist views. After teaching at Makarere University, Southall taught at several other schools including the University of East Africa, the University of California, and Syracuse University. He taught from 1969 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, becoming professor emeritus in 1990.Ray Abrahams, \\" Aidan Southall: Anthropologist who studied tribal societies and urbanisation in Africa\\", The Guardian, 17 August 2009. Due to extensive fieldwork and research, Southall was also able to become fluent in several languages including Nilotic languages, Swahili and French. He also became a member of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. Furthermore, Southall was also a member of International African Institute, The African Studies Association of USA and the American Anthropological Association. Work For his doctoral dissertation, Aidan Southall wrote Alur Society: A Study in Processes and Types of Domination (1956), which dealt with political structures among the Alur people of Northwest Uganda. He carried out anthropological fieldwork among the Alur people for approximately two years between 1949 and 1952. Southall described a continuous process of political and cultural domination, done almost entirely without the use of force. His next publication was Townsmen in the Making: Kampala and its Suburbs (1957), featuring two specific reports that were developed as part of a general study of African life in greater Kampala, Uganda. Examining such issues as land, housing, economic activity, and marriage, Southall drew upon the survey results for specific information while also supplementing quantitative data with qualitative material and anecdotes. As Aidan Southall grew more experienced in observing urban systems, he released Social Change in Modern Africa (1961), which contained the proceedings of the First International African Institute Seminar at Makarere, a Kampala school where he taught. This seminar and publication speculated about how complex social systems should be studied. \\"The Illusion of the Tribe\\" was published in 1970 in The Passing of Tribal Man, edited by P.C.W. Gutkind, and reprinted in 2010 in Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation. Southall later published a collection of papers, originally presented at the Wenner-Gren seminar of 1964, about cross cultural similarities in the urbanisation process. This collection of papers was titled Urban Anthropology: Cross Cultural Studies of Urbanization (1973) and attempted to identify and characterise significant issues in urban anthropology. Later that decade, Southall published a collection of essays entitled Small Urban Centers in Rural Development in Africa (1979). His essays are broken down in different categories, the first of which represented the social and anthropological perspective. Other essays took historical or political viewpoints, followed by economic case studies, and finished with an argument about whether their findings are conceptual or theoretical in nature. Aidan Southall's next big published work, in conjunction with Greg Gulin, was entitled Urban Anthropology in China (1993). This text originated at the First International Urban Anthropology Conference in China in December 1989, after being postponed and put on hold many times. This collection of essays involves Chinese urban ethnicity, finished off by Chinese urban culture and life cycles. His final book was The City in Time and Space (2000), written about cities on a grand scale. Having studied urbanisation his entire life, this book was an overview of what he believed the life process to encompass. The book starts off as a survey of implications, varying across time and space, of demographic, social, cultural, political, and economic concentration for society as a whole. According to social anthropologist Ray Abrahams: > Despite the range and undoubted importance of so many of his works, Aidan's > impact on his fellow anthropologists was more diffuse than that of some more > prominent British figures, partly because he worked outside the boundaries > of major \\"schools\\" in Cambridge, Manchester and Oxford. The Marxist > theoretical position he adopted became less fashionable, and the grand scope > of his last book was almost \\"an impossible act to follow\\".

As the chorus comes in, young girls appear with Kimbra, all playing tambourines, and it shows that the tuxedos, blindfolds, and nails of the men begin to change into bright colours of the rainbow as the music continues. But the man in the middle, who is supposed to be Kimbra's \\"cameo lover,\\" does not change colours until later on in the song, as the men next to him encourage him by lip syncing and hitting their desks to the beat. As the set goes dark, the two girls from Kimbra's \\"Settle Down\\" music video join her, dressed in blue, they lip sync with Kimbra and begin to play tambourines as all the other girls. In the end, confetti falls around the girls and Kimbra as the songs begins to end and they dance around happily. The men in the desks all change colours of their suits, and the man in the middle takes off his blindfold revealing his blue eyes to Kimbra.

This crisis was exceptional at the time, as a movement of population this big in such a short period of time was unseen since WWII. In addition to the ones going to Albania, a large number of Kosovo refugees fled to the Republic of Macedonia. Almost all of the remaining 500,000 to 600,000 individuals in Kosovo were also displaced in the region itself, without leaving it.  Refugee crisis, from March to June 1999  In March 1999, the NATO started a military air strike in Kosovo, in the name of a \\"Humanitarian War\\". This led to many Albanians fleeing from Kosovo to neighboring countries,UNHCR, Evaluation and Policy Analysis Unit (2000), The Kosovo refugee crisis, An Independent evaluation of UNHCR's emergency preparedness and response retrieved 3. March 2018 mainly from March to June 1999. Albania opened its borders from the beginning of the crisis in order to let refugees come. People were arriving directly at the border located at the north east of the country, or were transferred from Macedonia. Albania was not prepared for so many people to come and asked for international help in order to cover refugees basic needs. To coordinate the operations, the Albanian government created the Emergency Management Group days after the NATO military air strike began. This group coordinated actions from main structures such as the UNHCR and many other organisations such as NGOs. The situation was nevertheless delicate during the first days because UNHCR and NGOs did not predict that the NATO bombings would last for several months and lead to such a movement of population. Equipment was at first lacking, but many international structures and NGO's raised funds and/or gave practical help to Albania. Several European countries stated that it was in the interests of the refugees to stay in the region and gave financial help. Germany, for example, gave money to build camps in Albania for refugees transferred from Macedonia. On top of the refugees placed in camps, the Albanian population welcomed many of them in their homes, sharing space and food. Almost 435,000 refugees had to leave Kosovo for Albania, according to the UNHCR. Most of them arrived directly in Albania and some of them were transferred from Macedonia. At the height of the Kosovo War, refugees were crossing the border into Albania at the rate of 4,000 people per hour. Afterward, the UNHCR stated that up to 25% of the population of Kosovo had fled. On June the 11th, 1999, the air campaign from the NATO stopped. The day before, a military technical agreement was signed by both parties and ended the armed conflict. Afterward, the UNHCR report written about the refugee crisis stated that it was well managed, regarding the circumstances.  After the crisis - From June 1999  In the peace treaty signed by the Nato and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was asked that refugees could go back to their homes. Most of the refugees were indeed able to go back to Kosovo during the same year, after the armed conflict ended.UNHCR (1999), Global Report, p.321, http://www.unhcr.org/3e2d4d50d.html  Controversy  The NATO blamed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá for the refugee crisis. Because of the instability in the region from 1998 already, the NATO did not separate the mass influx of refugee from 1998 to the end of the conflict in its statistics. According to several researchers, however, the mass influx started just after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

Campaigns * Korean War service Called \\"Little Tigers\\". * Voluntary service in the Vietnam War in 1968-1969 Called the \\"Queen's Cobra\\". * Suppressed communist terrorists and helped civilians in Nan Province in 1975. * Received the Order of Rama for stopping Vietnamese border incursions on the Thai- Cambodian border in 1983. Organization The regiment is composed of three subordinate units: the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Infantry Battalions. *1st Infantry Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, Queen's Guard *2nd Infantry Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, Queen's Guard *3rd Infantry Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, Queen's Guard Uniform * Rajchawanlop hat with black tuft with the royal cypher of the queen. * Purple woolen top with black woolen mane embroidered with the queen's cypher on the wrist. * Black woolen trousers with two purple stripes per side. Training =Selection= Trainee must be serve in the 21st Regiment Queen's Guard or be permitted by the Royal Thai Army to attend the training. =Training content= The Queen's Tigers run a training course every two years. Its duration is 16 weeks. * Physical and mental conditioning in preparation for the next phase. This phase takes four weeks. Only those who passing this phase move to the next phase. * Forest and mountain training (four weeks): This phase focuses on infiltration by air and ground. Small unit tactics. Guerrilla warfare tactics. * Sea phase (three weeks): Water infiltration and tactical diving. Coastal patrolling, amphibious warfare, living off the sea, parachuting into water. * Urban phase (three weeks): Urban operations, anti-terrorist ops, hostage rescue, tactical us of motorbikes. * Air phase (two weeks): Parachuting, parachute packing and problem solving. =Award for completion= Those who successfully complete the tiger training course receive a military capabilities plate from the queen. The metal plate is decorated with a purple heart and the queen's cypher. The lower part is a blue ribbon contain the honorific \\"Tiger Soldier\\". To both sides of the purple heart are tigers soaring above mountains, waves, and clouds. Political influence In the 1990s, according to one academic, \\"...the Eastern Tigers amassed considerable wealth by trading gems with Cambodian Khmer Rouge insurgents based along the two countries' border, a racket which 'directly benefited'... some of its commanders. Within a decade, the Eastern Tigers dominated the Thai military.\\" The Queen's Guard have since had an inordinate influence on Thai politics. Former Queen's Guard commanders led the May 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat that toppled the elected government.

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 91st place out of 180 countries with score 38. (39 in 2016, 36 in 2015, 33 in 2014 and 31 in 2013). Corruption is still considered one of the most problematic factors for establishing business in Albania. Even though anti-corruption legal framework of Albania is moderate, its enforcement is weak and corruption conviction rates are still very low. Corruption and Human Development in Albania After 1990, Albania has passed from a centralized economy to a liberal one. Liberalization has brought both positive and negative effects to the politics, economy and other social aspects. There are two main components that measure a country‚Äôs progress toward success. Firstly, the economic growth is the most used and discussed indicator of the progress. During the last two decades the economists have been more interested in the economic development, consisting of the aggregate of health, education level and income rather than economic growth. Secondly, the corruption level is found to be a significant component of progress. Different researches have founded out a negative relationship between corruption level and countries‚Äô progress. Empirical research of Hysa (2011) reveals that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between corruption indexes and human development. Empirical evidence of the study, comparing Albania with the EU member countries, suggests that more corrupted countries tend to have lower levels of human development. In the Albanian case, the relationship between corruption and human development is found to be much stronger than in the EU countries.Hysa, E. (2011).

Rd. 595) was a proposed primary county road in Marquette County in the US state of Michigan. The road would have provided access from the northern part of the county, near the Eagle Mine in Michigamme Township, to US Highway 41 (US 41) and M-28 in Humboldt Township. The approximately road would have been used primarily for commercial truck traffic hauling rock from the Eagle Mine to a processing facility south of US 41/M-28 in Humboldt Township. At present, such traffic has to use existing county roads which involves passing through the cities of Marquette, Negaunee, and Ishpeming. The northern end would have been northeast of the mine in Champion Township at an intersection with the Triple A Road (Co. Rd. AAA). In 2003, a flood along the Dead River destroyed or forced the closure of several bridges over the river, isolating the northern half of the county. In 2007, Kennecott Minerals received permission to operate the Eagle Mine in the northern part of Marquette County. The company, in a consortium with other local businesses, proposed the construction of a new road to connect their mine with their mill at the former Humboldt Mine. This project, called Woodland Road, was to be built by these private interests. After encountering permitting issues, the private companies involved canceled the project. The Marquette County Road Commission (MCRC) applied for permits from the state and federal governments in 2010, reviving the road as CR 595\\\\. Kennecott pledged to finance construction, but removed its support in early 2011 over uncertainty in the permit timetable. After protests from the City of Marquette and local residents, Kennecott restored its commitments to the project. The MCRC moved forward through the permitting process in 2012. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed two formal objections to the road. In response, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), the state-level agency handling the permit application, opened a public comment period and held a public hearing on the matter. Several groups spoke in support and opposition, various local, state and federal officials expressed support for the project, and the EPA maintained its objections. After several deadline extensions, the agency lifted one objection and reiterated a second, setting a 30-day timetable in December 2012 for a final decision. The DEQ was forced to deny the permit on January 3, 2013, based on the EPA position on CR 595\\\\. With that action, Kennecott Minerals diverted its financial support from the project to upgrade existing roads instead. In late December 2014, state legislators announced interest in suing the EPA in an effort to force federal permits to be issued to build the roadway; the MCRC announced their intent to sue the EPA in January 2015, and the suit was filed on July 8, 2015. The final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied without review on March 4, 2019. Route description The county road would have started at its southern end at an intersection with US 41/M-28 in Humboldt Township. This intersection would be east of the intersection known as Koski Corners, where US 41/M-28 intersects M-95. From its terminus, CR 595 would have run north and passed into Champion Township near a crossing of a line of the Canadian National Railway before turning eastward. The road would have crossed the Middle Branch of the Escanaba River and continued northeasterly into the adjacent Ely Township. Planning maps from late 2011 show CR 595 following what is now Wolf Lake Road in the area but bypassing some curves to follow a straighter route. South of Brocky Lake, the new county road would have crossed the Second River and turned northwesterly parallel to Dishno Road back into Champion Township. This proposed route would have turned back northward near Wolf Lake, crossed Voelkers Creek and passed to the west of Silver Lake through hilly terrain. Immediately west of Silver Lake, CR 595 would have crossed the Dead River and Wildcat Canyon Creek. Through this area, the road would have passed through land owned by one of a few timber companies and other developers. To the north, there would have been a crossing of Mulligan Creek in Michigamme Township south of the mine property. North of the mine, CR 595 was to turn northeasterly through the Yellow Dog Plains and crossed the Yellow Dog River before re-entering Champion Township. Immediately after crossing that political boundary, CR 595 would have terminated at the intersection with Triple A Road (Co. Rd. AAA) near the Salmon Trout River. Along the proposed route, the terrain is heavily forested and hilly, except in the vicinity of the lakes, rivers and streams where there are wetlands. History =Background= On May 14, 2003, a section of the Silver Lake Dam failed in northwestern Marquette County. The area received of rain, and an earthen dike breached. The failure sent of water rushing down the Dead River. The flood waters forced the closure of the Steel Bridge carrying CR 510 over the river. As the waters approached the city of Marquette, the old CR 550 bridge was submerged, and the newer parallel structure that carries CR 550 was closed to traffic as well. The effect of these road closures isolated Big Bay from the rest of the county. The flooding damaged or destroyed the bridges carrying county roads AAO and AAT over the river, as well as the Lakeshore Boulevard and old CR 550 bridges. Several other bridges on tributaries of the Dead River were impacted by flooding. The MCRC and City of Marquette estimated that the road-related damages were in the neighborhood of $650,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Since the flood a new, roughly bridge has been constructed on CR 510, ensuring that any future flooding on the Dead River would not necessitate closure of the modern bridge. This structure was built at that height in order to benefit commercial interests in the area, as well as to provide the area with reliable public and emergency access. Rio Tinto Group, the British-based parent company of Kennecott Minerals received permission in 2007 to operate a nickel mine on the Yellow Dog Plains in Marquette County. The mine, dubbed Project Eagle or the Eagle Mine by the company, has been controversial with area residents. Some residents have praised the project as good for the economy, while others including area Indian tribes, have opposed the development citing environmental concerns. Lawsuits have delayed construction and operation of the mine, in addition to economic concerns. Kennecott started construction on the mine in 2011, and they expected to begin mineral extraction in 2013. Opposition to the mine and its operation extended to plans to construct a new road to carry the ore from the mine to a mill for processing. =Woodland Road= Kennecott Minerals, in a consortium with other businesses, originally proposed a privately built road in the area called Woodland Road. The group included the Michigan Forest Products Council, a local construction company, and local landowners. Kennecott wanted the road to shorten the truck route from the Eagle Mine to its processing mill in Humboldt Township from over the previously approved route along Triple A Road (Co. Rd. AAA), CR 510, CR 550 and US 41/M-28. According to the permit application, the road was also to improve access to the forest lands in the area used by timber companies for logging, and it was to provide enhanced recreational access to remote areas of Marquette County. The private interests involved planned to build and maintain Woodland Road to state and county road standards at no cost to the county road commission. By March 2010 the project had encountered permit issues. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) asked the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) to deny the necessary wetlands mitigations permits and to reconsider \\"alternative transportation routes that utilize existing main roads\\". The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) were also critical of the project. Based on the actions by the EPA, if the DNRE did not deny the permits, and EPA objections were not resolved, the project would require clearance through the CoE under the Clean Water Act. Local citizens' groups joined the federal agencies in criticizing the road. In the face of the federal agency opposition, the consortium withdrew their permit applications in May 2010. The businesses involved indicated at the time that they would revise their proposals and reapply. Local government leaders supported the road as a means to support economic activity and reduce truck traffic through populated areas in the county. =County involvement= The MCRC became involved with the roadway, which they gave the CR 595 designation, in October 2010. The commission approved a resolution to authorize planning of an all- weather, road. Members of the public present for the meeting expressed opposition to the project that would have been funded by Kennecott Minerals. The company provided assurances to the county that they would pay the $50- to 80-million cost to plan and construct CR 595. The director of the DNRE said that the department was weighing the options between environmental impacts of the road and impacts of mine truck traffic using the previously approved route through Marquette, Negaunee and Ishpeming. Kennecott removed its support for the project during January 2011. In a statement, the company said that the timeline for the permit process was uncertain, and they considered their currently permitted route to the best option. This move angered city officials in Marquette because it meant a return to trucking ore through the city along CR 550, Sugarloaf Avenue and Wright Street. MCRC officials had stated that \\"we're going to push it as hard and as fast as we can\\", according to the board chairman. After the company backed away, local officials protested Kennecott's return to its previously approved trucking route between the mine and the mill. Within a month however, the company reinstated support for the project after the MCRC asked Kennecott to reconsider. The company held a series of public forums starting in April 2011 about their operations, including transportation plans, and the road commission did the same that August. =Moving forward with the permit process= In September 2011, the MCRC voted to move forward with a modified routing to CR 595; the new route was to pass to the west of Brocky Lake instead of the east to address concerns from the public. The new route decreased the length by while adding another creek crossing. The EPA and local environmental groups opposed the road, while Humboldt Township officials supported it. As part of the permitting process the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) held public hearings in 2012 about the CR 595 project. In drafting its application, the MCRC said that the purpose of the project is: > To construct a primary county north‚Äìsouth road that # connects and improves > emergency, commercial, industrial and recreational access to a somewhat > isolated but key industrial and recreational area in northwest Marquette > County to US 41; and # reduces truck travel from this area through Marquette > County population centers. Hearings were held by the DEQ on February 15, 2012, and a decision at the state level was due by June 15, 2012. The EPA was to make its decision on the federal level based on input from the USFWS, the DEQ and the CoE; the CoE, USFWS and EPA all submitted comments that were extremely critical of the CR 595 proposal. EPA had recommended that the road commission re-examine two alternative routings; one would add a crossing of the Yellow Dog River immediately downstream of Pinnacle Falls, which the MCRC said would entail high construction costs. The second alignment would increase the length of the road by . In May 2012 the EPA filed a formal objection to the project which gave the MCRC until July 22 to address its concerns. Until the objection could be cleared, the DEQ could only issue a state-level permit for the project which would then require federal approval from the CoE, similar to the situation encountered by the Woodland Road proposal in 2010. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) expressed concerns over the potential for vehicle‚Äìwildlife accidents but also that these concerns could be minimized. The department expressed a willingness to work with the MCRC to address these concerns through consultations over several recommendations. In related news, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) announced a Transportation Economic Development Fund grant that would pay to reconstruct CR 601, which connects M-95 with the Humboldt Mill, and Co. Rd. AAA. The grant money was being provided to the MCRC, with local matching funds provided by Kennecott, to upgrade the two roads to \\"all-weather\\" status. Additional improvements were to include a left-turn lane for southbound traffic turning onto CR 601 from M-95 and the flattening of a small hill on CR 601. By the end of May 2012, the DEQ had lodged an objection to the CR 595 permit application; however, the MCRC was working to address it to receive the permits by the following July. The county expected a permit decision the week of June 23, 2012. One of the opponents of both the mine and the road, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, drew criticism of their stance during a meeting of the Marquette County Commission on June 26, 2012, that was discussing the tribe's plans to move its casino from Chocolay Township to the site of the former Marquette County Airport in Negaunee Township. On July 12, it was announced that the deadline for a permit decision by the DEQ has been extended until October 1, 2012, with the permission of the MCRC; state law allows a permit applicant to approve or request such extensions. The MCRC has stated that any funding for the project by Kennecott Minerals may be impacted if the permit process runs longer than the new time frame. While there was no formal contract, the company has said it would provide funding if permits are granted and work on the road is started before May 2013. The EPA scheduled a public hearing on August 28, 2012, as part of a public comment period that ran through September 4. The DEQ had asked the EPA to render a decision on its objections by October 1. =Political support and bureaucratic opposition= According to Jim Iwanicki, the engineer-manager of the MCRC, and Gerald Corkin, a member of the County Commission, US Senator Carl Levin were willing to help local officials obtain the necessary EPA clearances. In addition, 28 of Michigan‚Äôs 38 state senators signed a letter to the EPA in support of the roadway. The MCRC staged an event on August 27, 2012, where several logging and aggregate trucks drove through the city of Marquette along the route currently used to connect between CR 550 and US 41/M-28. Bill Hennigan, one of the drivers from a local timber company, said, \\"we want people to understand there's a lot of truck traffic through Marquette now coming from the northern part of the county going to various points, and once the mine starts, there's going to be even more truck traffic going through Marquette.\\" Hennigan and Iwanicki both commented in the press to the fact that the current routes from the northern end of the county south to US 41/M-28 involve passing through populated areas in Ishpeming, Negaunee or Marquette, and that the new road would provide a north‚Äìsouth corridor that was west of the Dead River. Officials were pushing the roadway as a multi-purpose facility, aimed to benefit other businesses like logging, tourism, recreation as well as the mine. At the EPA hearing on August 28, 2012, statements of support were read on behalf of US Senator Debbie Stabenow, US Representative Dan Benishek, Governor Rick Snyder, State Senator Tom Casperson, and State Rep. Matt Huuki. The Michigan departments of Agriculture and Rural Development, Natural Resources, and Transportation also sent letters of support for the road project, which is also supported by the Lake Superior Community Partnership (LSCP), and the Central Upper Peninsula Planning & Development Regional Commission. The township supervisors for Michigamme and Powell townships expressed desire for minor routing changes. Michigamme Township wanted the southern terminus shifted away from Wolf Lake Road (Co. Rd. FY) and Powell Township wanted the roadway extended into Big Bay. Supporters speaking at the meeting cited the benefits to public safety, job creation, less pollution, and moving truck traffic out of populated areas. Opponents cited concerns over the ability of the MCRC to maintain the road based on its budgets, destruction of wetlands, and concerns related to Rio Tinto. An official with the National Wildlife Federation questioned why a road was needed instead of a rail line to haul materials in and out of the area. The EPA objection was primarily based on inadequate consideration of alternative routes and unacceptable impacts to aquatic resources; they asked for more information on two alternatives. The Mulligan Plains East route that would run for at a project cost of $126 million and the Red Road/Sleepy Hollow route that was and $107 million. Both alternatives involved less wetland area (15.7 or 18.3 acres respectively vs. 24.3, that is, 6.4 or 7.4 hectares respectively vs. 9.8) and fewer stream crossings, but each runs east of Silver Lake and crosses the Dead River. At the time of the meeting, MCRC announced a plan to preserve additional wetlands as part of the McCormick Wilderness to expand its wetlands mitigation plan for the CR 595 project. The land measured and would be called the \\"Dishno Creek Headwaters Wetland Preservation Area\\". Conservation easements would limit development activities on the parcel owned by various timber companies. The new proposal would mean that of wetlands mitigation would be provided for every of wetlands used to build the roadway. This compared to the 2:1 and 1.5:1 ratios from the county road commission's original plan. Compensation to the land owners would be provided by Rio Tinto if the plan was approved. The deadline was later extended to December 1, 2012, with assurances that Rio Tinto would still finance the road if construction started in the spring of 2013; the delay was to allow the EPA additional time to consider the comments from the public hearing in August. The DEQ had asked the EPA to withdraw its objections so that the project could be approved, reiterating the state's support for the project. The backup plan was to upgrade CR 550 to \\"all-weather status\\" if CR 595 is not approved; currently weight restrictions are enacted each spring on that roadway. CR 595 was even a topic of discussion as part of the 2012 US presidential election as a family member of Mitt Romney discussed the road at a campaign event in Marquette. The EPA dropped one of its two remaining objections to CR 595 on December 4, 2012. The agency no longer found fault with the MCRC's methods for determining the route of the proposed road, but reaffirmed its objection to how the road commission's plan would minimize impacts to wetlands and streams. The MCRC and DEQ had 30 days to modify plans for the road to account for the remaining objection, or the permitting process would restart under the review of the CoE. =Cancellation= The DEQ announced in a letter to the EPA and MCRC on January 3, 2013, that the department would not be issuing a permit for the project. The department supported the road plan, but said that the complexities of the EPA's outstanding objection prevented the roadway from meeting the requirements of the Clean Water Act. After this action, authority to issue construction permits for the road transferred to the CoE in a new permit process. Iwanicki, the MCRC engineer-manager, went on record in an interview with The Mining Journal to say that the EPA changed the requirements to satisfy the agency's objections to the project throughout discussions in December 2012. \\"The EPA moved the bar every time we got close. Throughout the whole process, it's been an ever-changing target\\", he said. The last changes to the project were made on December 27, 2012, to comply with EPA objections, but the DEQ staff working on the permit were sent on vacation rather than continue to work on the project. In the wake of these developments, Kennecott Minerals transferred its financial support from the CR 595 project toward improving existing county roads in the area. The MCRC will not apply for a permit through the CoE, canceling the project instead. Mine trucks would instead use existing roads from the Big Bay area south to Marquette and west to Humboldt Township, including streets that pass through the campus of Northern Michigan University (NMU). Reaction to the decision included disappointment from various elected officials. Congressman Benishek faulted the EPA's regulations for placing \\"too high a hurdle for this project\\" and for killing jobs in the area. Benishek also stated that he would fight for the project and investigate what can be done to move it forward. The congressman has requested a hearing on the matter as well. Marquette County Board Chair Deborah Pellow expressed interest in suing the EPA for its denial of the permits to build the road. The county board thanked the road commission in a letter of thanks, approved unanimously at their January 8, 2013, meeting. Casperson was also of the opinion that the EPA and other regulatory agencies had an \\"agenda\\" against projects related to the mine. On the other side of the controversy, Catherine Parker said that the MCRC could not have done enough mitigation work to satisfy concerns over the road, and that she was \\"relieved that we can finally lay this issue to rest and direct our resources elsewhere, namely to improving existing roads.\\" Officials with the KBIC were also \\"gratified\\" by the decision, and called it a \\"victory for the integrity of the nation's Clean Water Act\\". Margaret Comfort, president of Save the Wild U.P., was \\"relieved\\" about the decision, but expressed the sentiment that the fight over the road was not concluded yet. =Revival= Iwanicki authored a white paper in June 2013 on transportation and road needs in the county. Of the four stages of the proposal endorsed by local governments, the first is a resurrection of the CR 595 proposal. The paper carries the endorsements of Marquette County, the City of Marquette, Marquette Township. NMU also \\"strongly supports the construction of [CR 595].\\" The university is concerned with the levels of truck traffic between the Eagle Mine and the processing mill passing near its campus. State officials are supporting the collaboration between the local governments and NMU; Casperson and State Rep. John Kivela received copies of the white paper, and Casperson's office is looking for ways to provide funding in support of continued efforts to build CR 595. The MCRC estimates that it will cost $500,000 to move forward with a permit application through the CoE. Most of the needed environmental studies have already been completed, and they can \\"repurposed before they are out-of-date\\". Since the cancellation of CR 595 in early 2013, Rio Tinto has sold the Eagle Mine to Lundin Mining, and there are no funding guarantees for construction of CR 595 if the permitting process is resumed. The MCRC board voted in November 2013 to continue consideration of the project, over the recommendations of the county commission. A truck hauling ore from the Eagle Mine down CR 550 tipped over on December 13, 2014, and was not removed from the roadway until the next day; about of ore was spilled in the accident. The roadway, called \\"a notoriously dangerous highway\\" by a local state representative, was the site of the first accident involving an ore hauler since the mine began production. The accident \\"created major delays for drivers\\" of up to two hours on the primary road between Big Bay and Marquette, which was upgraded and designated as part of a truck route into and through the City of Marquette to enable the mine's ore to pass to the processing mill. The accident prompted additional renewed interest in building CR 595. In an interview with WLUC-TV that aired on December 26, 2014, State Senator Casperson (-Escanaba) and State Representatives Kivela (-Marquette), Scott Dianda (-Calumet) and Ed McBroom (-Escanaba) said that they had been discussing options to get the roadway built. The MCRC was expected to file suit against the EPA in January 2015 over the denied permits for the road. Opponents like the group Save the Wild UP are disappointed that the road commission is once again moving forward with the road. Just days later, the chair of the MCRC board said that there had been no decision on a lawsuit, although there are \\"possibilities\\" and interest in a suit. However, during its January 19, 2015 regular meeting, the road commission board went into closed session with their attorneys and emerged with a resolution to sue, which the board unanimously voted to support. The board's chairman, Dave Hall, said \\"[the board] believes strongly in how we feel about this road and the need for its existence.\\" Hall cited the December 2014 accident, and a second in early January 2015, as factors prompting the MCRC to move forward with the lawsuit. The Marquette County Board of Commissioners has opposed the suit, citing issues related to the private funding of the suit, provocation of the EPA when permits related to the Eagle Mill are pending, and funding for the road if it is eventually built. In contrast, the Marquette County Townships Association, a group representing the townships in the county, has supported the suit while Lundin Mining is staying neutral. A local group called Stand UP formed to fund the costs of the lawsuit, soliciting donations from supporters of the road; the group's leaders include former chairman of the County Board of Commissioners and current Tilden Township Supervisor Deborah Pellow, Tony Retaskie of the Upper Peninsula Construction Council in Escanaba, and retired banker Stu Bradley. On July 8, 2015, the MCRC filed their lawsuit in the Marquette division of the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. According to Deb Pellow, chairwoman of the Stand UP board of directors, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA resulted in the disclosure of documents that show that the EPA had pre- determined its decision on the road before the permitting process had begun. The agency, according to Pellow, had told various environmental groups as well as \\"staff members for a California senator\\" that the road would not be allowed before the permit application had been submitted. The state senator and state representatives for the Western and Central UP all repeated their bipartisan support for the lawsuit after it was filed, which is also supported by the LSCP. The lawsuit was dismissed in district court on May 18, 2016, and a request for a rehearing based on the Supreme Court decision in Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. was denied the next month. The suit had been appealed to the Sixth Circuit. The decision in Hawkes states that these types of regulatory determinations are immediately appealable to the courts without the need to continue the licensing process, such as the option to refile for a permit for CR 595 from the CoE instead of the DEQ/EPA. The MCRC and the EPA entered court-ordered mediation to resolve the lawsuit, and the MCRC's lawyers called upon the Trump Administration to settle the case and allow the road to be built. The appeals court ruled in favor of the EPA in March 2017. The case ended when the Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2019.
