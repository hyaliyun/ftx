She is a 2012 Andy Warhol Curatorial Fellow and a 2014 United Nations Programme for People of African Descent Fellow.  Early life and education  Lewis was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to computer analyst father Wayne Lewis and retired social worker mother Patricia Scott. Lewis was introduced to African American history by her father through her own genealogy as a child where she learned she was a descendant of Henri Christophe, the first king of free Haiti in 1811. She comes from a family of teachers: Her paternal great grandfather, Nathan Lewis, was a student at Tuskegee University, and later taught at Southern University A&M; and her paternal great grandmother, Della Atkinson, was a professor at Straight College, which is known today as Dillard University. In 2000, Lewis received a bachelor's degree from Howard University in African American Studies. By then, her childhood experience with Black history grew into a career, teaching African- American Studies at Hyde Leadership Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. Lewis then earned a master's degree in African American Studies from Temple University in 2006. She returned to her hometown after the Hurricane Katrina disaster to help with revitalization and taught African World Studies at Dillard University.  Career  After returning home to Louisiana in 2007, Lewis became Executive Director and Curator of the McKenna Museum of African American Art. From 2009 to 2013, Lewis was the Director of Exhibitions and Programs at the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute (CCCADI) in New York City. In 2010, Lewis began working on The Dandy Lion Project, curating images of black dandies that has taken the form of an international traveling exhibition, a film series and a book. The project connects the subversive contemporary fashion and lifestyle movement to historical images and has dated the movement that blends African aesthetics with European menswear back to the fifteenth century in Africa. Women dandies and trans men are also featured, further complicating the idea of black masculinity. Lewis focused on curating images authored by over 30 photographers of the African Diaspora, thus reclaiming the authorship of images that in another context might have historically been seen as exploitive. This project has been exhibited at Museum of Contemporary Photography at Columbia College Chicago, Silver Eye Center for Photography in Pittsburgh, the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco, the Brighton Photo Biennial, and Lowe Museum of Art in Miami. Lewis gained attention as a cultural critic when Beyonc√©'s Formation video went public, critiquing its colorism, use of Bounce music, and the use of images from New Orleans that viscerally evoked the Hurricane Katrina storm where Lewis lost her grandmother and great-grandmother. Lewis has also curated: SOS: Magic, Revelry, and Resistance in Post-Katrina New Orleans Art, Life After Death: A Multi-Media Analysis of the Persona that Was/Is Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Wearing Spirit: Aesthetically Personifying the Feminine in African Sacred Traditions, Sex Crimes Against Black Girls, and Black Pete, Zwarte Piet: The Documentary. Lewis is also on the Board of Directors for the Black Star Film Festival and is the Chief Philadelphia Dream Director at The Future Project.  Personal life  Lewis lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lewis' exhibition, \\"Sex Crimes Against Black Girls,\\" was partly inspired by her personal experience with abuse as a child. In 2016, Lewis married business owner Tony Oluwatoyin Lawson with a wedding they called the \\"Royal Wedding of Zamunda\\" inspired by the blend of their Yoruba Nigerian, New Orleanian and Lucumi cultures with a nod to the film, Coming to America. The wedding included a traditional second line.

It is located south of the town centre on high ground overlooking the Greater Glasgow urban area. Location and housing The majority of the housing is a local authority 'scheme' constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s to alleviate housing shortages in the area. The territory was previously farmland including the Whitlawburn farm, which itself took its name from the Whitlaw Burn stream which runs down from the Cathkin Braes at the western side of the district. Pedestrian underpass between Springhall and Whitlawburn A dual carriageway which is part of the A749 road running from East Kilbride to Glasgow carries a local bus route, and also separates Whitlawburn from the neighbouring areas of Springhall and Cathkin to the west which are part of the town of Rutherglen - however most local amenities are shared between the three districts. An underpass runs under the road between Springhall and Whitlawburn. To the east, a sprawling network of housing developments at Greenlees spreads out over fields towards Halfway. There is also an entrance to Cambuslang Public Park. Bute Tower, one of six multi-storey blocks in the area The Whitlawburn area itself is dominated visually by six near-identical 13-storey tower blocks (named Arran, Ailsa, Benmore, Bute, Kintore and Roslin and containing 432 apartments) on the south side of the main road through the district, with modern tenements arranged in a grid pattern to either side, along with a local retail area (Nisa, Greggs, William Hill, soft play area, etc.). Built using the Reema method of construction and originally uniformly grey concrete and brutalist in appearance, the area was regenerated from the 1990s onwards with the tenement buildings painted/rendered in brighter colours and given pitched roofs (they had originally been flat-roofed despite the frequently wet conditions in the west of Scotland) and the tower blocks fitted with cladding, roofs and ambient lighting in a ¬£21m project.West Whitlawburn Multi-Storey Flats Overcladding, RIASWest Whitlawburn Tower Blocks, D+B Facades The towers have the same design as five others nearby (Springhall, Halfway, central Cambuslang),The Story of Rosebank Tower, Tower Blocks UK, 16 September 2019 but they now look quite different from their 'cousins' as a result of the refurbishment. In 1989, West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative Ltd was established by residents who were unhappy with deteriorating housing conditions and out of a sense of unfairness at the tenements being prioritised.Lesley Riddoch: The epidemic hospitals can't cure, The Scotsman, 2011 The organisation also put in place an extensive CCTV and concierge system.

However, on 23 January 1810 he took a discharge, due to poor health. In 1812, amidst the French invasion of Russia by Napoleon, Alexander Davydov returned to the army and served under Mikhail Miloradovich at the battles of Tarutino, Maloyaroslavets, Vyazma, and lastly Krasny. For his efforts at Krasny, he received the Order of St. Vladimir (3rd class). In the ensuing year, in 1813, he served at the battles of L√ºtzen, Bautzen, Dresden (received Order of St. George, 4th class) and lastly Kulm. 1814 would be his last year of military action, and he served at the battles of Bar-sur-Aube, Troyes, Arcis-sur-Aube, F√®re-Champenoise and lastly Paris.

Beall, together with Greg Restall (a Melbourne logician and philosopher), is a pioneer of a widely discussed version of logical pluralism, according to which any given natural language has not one but many relations of logical consequence. Beall is also widely known for advocating a glut- theoretic account (see: dialetheism) of deflationary truth (Spandrels of Truth (2009)). Against the standard no-gap tradition in glut theory, also known as dialetheism (most famous in the philosopher Graham Priest‚Äôs work), Beall's early and post-2013 work advocates a gluts-and-gaps account of language, advocating not only the existence of truth-value gluts but also of truth-value gaps. The adoption of both gaps and gluts distinguishes Beall from other researchers in a broadly dialetheist framework, who usually accept only gluts.

Dedicated to advancing the boundaries of contemporary performance, Manson has expanded the field through his use of digital media, creative interdisciplinary collaborations, and teaching. Manson is the Editor in Chief and co-curator at Contemporary Performance Network, a community organizing platform and social network dedicated to facilitating collaboration among artists, presenters, scholars and festivals. He is the co- Artistic director of the Special Effects festival, an experimental performance festival which premiered in January 2014. He was the Head of the John Wells Directing Program at Carnegie Mellon University from 2014-2019 and is currently the Director of the Undergraduate and Graduate Theatre Program at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. Education A Texas native, Manson attended University of Texas at Austin, where he earned awards in acting and a Presidential scholarship that supported his Bachelor of Arts in Theatre. Manson moved to New York in 1995, and in 1999, along with Jemma Nelson, he founded Big Art Group. Initially a small underground performance group, the company has since burgeoned into an internationally appreciated and critically acclaimed ensemble. Direction Manson has been responsible for the direction, co-creation, set and media design of Big Art Group's productions since its initial original work, CLEARCUT Catastrophe in 1999. Since CLEARCUT, the company has produced 22 original works with repeated tours. The People, a serial production adaptively rewritten for each city it is presented in has enjoyed success in Polverigi, Halle, San Francisco, Portland, and most recently New York. Manson's work is characterized by its intense visual spectacle, savvy blending of video and live acting to produce self-reflective commentary on its own genre, and technical sophistication. At its birth, Manson envisioned Big Art Group as a means to, 'aggressively attack the boundaries of performance and art through its experimentation with structure, medium and process.\\" Big Art Group's unique integration of live acting and video, known as Real Time Film, was pioneered and titled by Manson himself, and has remained a characteristic element of the artist's work, revisited and developed in new productions. Much of Big Art Group's work blends elements of popular culture and current events with scenes inspired by literature or Classical mythology. Manson's work seeks to actively engage and challenge its audience and to confront expectations constructed by traditional theatre: \\"Unlike traditional theatrical performance, Big Art Group's extended mediated performances reposition viewers into active editors, challenging audience members to problem-solve complex issues of sexuality, race, narrative and truth as a theatrical mirror to the process of navigation through contemporary society.\\" In an interview with the village voice, Manson remarked on the political quality of Big Art's serial project, The People, and on his broader goal of encouraging popular engagement in art, politics, and thought: \\"For me, culture is a space for critical thought,\\" says Manson. \\"We're not really making a show, we're making a space for people to think.\\" Fellowships, honors and awards Manson has been honored with multiple funding grants from Rockefeller Foundation's Multi Arts Production Fund, fellowships from The Foundation of Contemporary Art, Pew Fellowship in the Arts, MidAtlantic Art Fellowship/ PennsylvaniaCouncil on the Arts, and MacDowell Colony. =Fellowships and honors= :MacDowell Colony (2011) :Pew Fellowship in the Arts (2002) :Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2001) :Named Top 10 New Theatrical Production's for Flicker in Italy by Corriere della Sera (2005) =Funding and awarded support= :Carnegie Mellon The Berkman Pro-Seed Fund (2017) :Carnegie Mellon Fund for Research and Creativity Award (2016) :National Performance Network Performance Residency (2012) :New York State Council on the Arts Grant (2010, 2011) :Rockefeller Foundation's Multi Arts Production Fund (2003, 2009) :Mid Atlantic Arts Fellowship/Pennsylvania Council on the Arts for general creation in the 2009/2010 creation cycle :Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) (2008) :√âtant Donn√©s, The French-American Fund for Performing Arts, (2006) :Florence Gould Foundation (2006) :Trust For Mutual Understanding (2006) :Greenwall Foundation (2004) :Arts International Grant (2004) :National Performance Network Creation Fund (2003) :DNA (Andrew W.

Ketterson is an American evolutionary biologist, behavioral ecologist, neuroendocrinologist and ornithologist best known for her experimental approach to the study of life-history trade-offs in a songbird, the Dark-eyed Junco. She is currently a Distinguished Professor of Biology, Director of the Environmental Resilience Institute, and affiliate professor in Congnitive Science, Gender Studies, Integrative Study of Animal Behavior, and Neuroscience at Indiana University.  Education and career  Ketterson obtained all of her degrees from Indiana University. She received A.B. in 1966 and M.A. in 1968, both in Botany. She received her Ph.D. in 1974 in Zoology. After receiving her doctoral degree, Ketterson was a postdoctoral scholar from 1974 to 1975 at Washington State University working with avian environmental physiologist James R. King. She was an assistant professor at Bowling Green State University from 1975 to 1977 before joining the faculty in the Department of Biology at Indiana University in 1977. Ketterson was appointed as a Distinguished Professor of Biology at Indiana University in 2006. She was also appointed as an affiliated faculty member of the Gender Studies department in 2003 and as a program faculty member of the Cognitive Science department in 2006 at Indiana University. Ketterson co-founded the Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior at Indiana University and served as the co-director from 1990 to 2002. Ketterson has been a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research on Sex, Gender, and Reproduction at Indiana University since 2007. Since 2017, Ketterson has served as the director of the Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University, which aims to predict impacts of environmental change and develop solutions to prepare Indiana businesses, farmers, communities and individuals for those impacts. In 2004, Ketterson received a Guggenheim fellowship to study plumage variation in junco species across North and Central America. Ketterson served as the president of the American Society of Naturalists in 2015. She has also won several major awards recognizing her career achievements in ornithology, including the American Ornithological Society Elliott Couse Award (1996), Wilson Ornithological Society Margaret Morse Nice Medal (awarded jointly with Val Nolan, Jr. in 1998), and the Alden Miller Award from the Cooper Ornithological Society (2014). She is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).  Research  Ketterson and her trainees, with her longtime collaborator and partner Val Nolan, Jr., have conducted long-term field studies combined with experimental manipulation of free-living dark-eyed juncos at the Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia since the 1970s. Early in her career, Ketterson focused on differential migration, a pattern of movement in which females migrate farther than males. Ketterson developed the experimental approach of manipulating levels of the hormone testosterone in free-living birds and comparing behavior, physiology, and fitness to controls in order to study the evolution of life history trade-offs. She coined the coined the term ‚Äòphenotypic engineering‚Äô to describe this approach. Ketterson's research showed that experimentally-elevated levels of testosterone increase aggression, reduce paternal care, and cause males to sing more. In addition, testosterone-treated males are preferred by females in mate choice tests and are more successful at mating outside the pair bond. However, she also found that testosterone-treated males have shorter life spans and reduced immune system function. Her research thus provided a mechanistic understanding of the fitness consequences of altering how animals allocate time and energy to competing demands (i.e. reproduction versus survival). Later, her work explored whether hormones, which affect multiple target tissues simultaneously and mediate coordinated suites of traits, either constrain or potentiate adaptation. This work foreshadowed her interest in addressing limits to organisms' ability to respond to environmental change and the role of hormonally-mediated seasonal timing of behaviors (like reproduction, molt, and migration) in the generation and loss of biodiversity. As the director of the Environmental Resilience Institute, she leads a team of Indiana University researchers to prepare the Hoosier state for the effects of on-going environmental change. The Ketterson research group currently conducts field research at a number of sites throughout the range of junco species, including in Indiana at Kent Farm on the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve, in the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia at the Mountain Lakes Biological Station, in California on the University of California, San Diego campus and at Laguna Mountain, in northwest Wyoming at Grand Teton National Park, Idaho, South Dakota, Mexico, and Guatemala. The 2013 documentary film project, 'Ordinary Extraordinary Junco: Remarkable Biology from a Backyard Bird' highlights years of research conducted by Ketterson and her colleagues.  Personal life  Ketterson was married for 28 years to the ornithologist Val Nolan, Jr., her Ph.D. mentor and long-time collaborator, until his death in 2008.

Berson (May 10, 1924 - January 13, 2017) was an American chemist who was a Sterling Professor at Yale University, and also a published author. He worked on the Sigmatropic rearrangements, the thermal and carbocationic rearrangements, and the role of orbital symmetry in chemical reactions when he was part of the University of Wisconsin. When he was part of Yale University, he was part of many new studies, especially on non-Kekul√© molecules. Early Life and Education Jerome Berson was born in Sanford, Florida to immigrant parents. His father served as a lay rabbi and his mother was a milliner and housewife. As a result of the Great Depression, his parents struggled to earn a living so they moved to The Bronx, New York in 1934 when Berson was about ten years old and stayed there until 1937. During this time Berson attended Junior High School. In 1937 his family relocated to Long Island, where he attended Long Island High School. Berson graduated high school at the age of 15. He worked riding a Good Humor Ice Cream bicycle for a year so he could save to pay for college. Berson attended City College of New York, primarily chosen for economic reasons, and graduated a semester early with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry in 1944. Later in 1947, he obtained a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University. In 1949, mentored by William von Eggers Doering, Berson earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Columbia University. He married Bella Zevitovsky, whom he met when they were undergraduates. They had three children, Ruth, David and Jon. Career and Research After he graduated from City College of New York, Berson began working on penicillin as an assistant chemist at Hoffmann-LaRoche. After brief employment at Hoffmann- LaRoche, he served in the U.S Army Medical Corps during World War II, advancing from private to sergeant. He returned in 1946 and did his dissertation research with William von Eggers Doering at Columbia University. During the academic year of 1949-1950, Berson was a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University with Robert Burns Woodward. He served on the faculties of the University of Southern California from 1950 to 1963, the University of Wisconsin from 1963 to 1969, and Yale University from 1969. During the time he worked at the University of Wisconsin the focus of his laboratory were the thermal and carbocationic rearrangements and the role of orbital symmetry in chemical reactions. Meanwhile, he had taken note of Erich H√ºckel's, which with Hund's Rule provided continuing themes in his thinking and research. While working at Yale University, he was part of many new studies, especially on non-Kekul√© molecules. He held the title Sterling Professor at Yale University since 1992 and Sterling Professor Emeritus of Chemistry and Senior Research Scientist since 1994. In addition to teaching and research, his activities at Yale University included service as chairman of the Department of Chemistry (1971-1974) and director of the Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering (1983-1990). He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1970 and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. Berson died peacefully at his home on January 13, 2017, at the age of 92. Honor Awards *National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship, Harvard University (R.B.

In the most common passenger version it was capable of carrying 13 men besides the driver, or of cargo. Since 1934, the 52 chassis of the Tatra 72 version were extensively modified to produce an armored car OA vz. 30. Other specialized versions have included telephone cable layers (52 built in 1933-1935), and machine gun carriers (23 delivered in August 1934). Also, in the first half of 1935 Tatra has delivered 100 pure cargo chassis. Another common (80 produced) model were command-maintenance cars build with two different cabin lengths, capable of carrying 5 passengers plus mixed cargo- passenger space at the rear. These cars were routinely issued to the commanders of the artillery regiments of the Czechoslovak army. Finally, 14 chassis were built as tourers with passenger space only.

Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, on Monday identified the bomber as 22-year-old Mahmoud Shafiq Mohammed Mustafa, who had worn a suicide vest. el-Sisi reported that three men and a woman have been arrested in connection with the attack; two others are being sought. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.al arabiya.net. This was the first time the church was ever bombed. Bombing The explosion occurred at around 10:00 am on 11 December 2016 in Cairo's Abbassia district. MENA news agency initially reported that an assailant had planted a device in a chapel near the church compound's premises. Security officials did not know at that time whether it was a suicide bombing or a remotely activated device, which they believed would have been a large one. The device reportedly contained of TNT. An unnamed church source told a Nile TV reporter that the bomb was thrown inside the cathedral's hall, adjacent to the entrance of the building. St Mark's Cathedral is constantly patrolled by security personnel. While security officials did not know the bomber's gender, some media organizations speculated that the assailant was a woman since most victims were women and children. Aftermath Roads leading to the site were blocked, after large contingents of security forces arrived. They cordoned off the area and started inspecting the church compound and its security cameras. The health ministry sent fourteen ambulances to the scene to assist the injured. The casualties were taken to the nearby Demerdash and Dar al-Shifa hospitals. The government placed Cairo International Airport and the city's transport system on alert, a measure which included a state of emergency in Cairo's subway network, tightening security protocols at each station's gates. Prime Minister Sherif Ismail and Cairo's security chief, General Khaled Abdel-Aal, visited the scene. The prosecutor general, Nabil Ahmed Sadeq, ordered the Homeland Security department to carry out an investigation. Cabinet spokesman Ashraf Sultan described the incident as a \\"terrorist\\" attack, and denied certain media reports about Interior Minister Magdy Abdel Ghaffar's alleged resignation, stating that Ghaffar had just attended a ministerial meeting to discuss the incident. Sultan also stressed the need for media figures to exercise caution while covering the events. The Interior Ministry said that it was investigating members of the police unit that was assigned to the church complex. On 26 December 2016 Egypt's Army Corps of Engineers stated they'd completed 80% of the renovations at the church and were hoping to have the church ready for 7 January, when Coptic Christians celebrate the Nativity. Perpetrators President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on 12 December, identified the bomber as 22-year-old Mahmoud Shafiq Mohammed Mustafa.Maggie Michael and Hamza Hendawi, \\"Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Egypt's president, says church attack was a suicide bombing\\", The Washington Times, 12 December 2016. el-Sisi reported that three men and a woman have been arrested in connection with the attack; two others are being sought. On 13 December, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility in Amaq News Agency. However, an Interior Ministry official, police Maj. Gen. Tarek Attia, said that the suicide bomber had been arrested in 2014 in Fayoum province, southwest of Cairo, on charges of being a member of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Mahmoud Hassan, one of Mustafa's lawyers, said his client was held for two months and tortured until he confessed to the possession of weapons and explosives. He also faced charges of membership in an \\"illegal organization\\", Egyptian parlance for the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Hassan insisted that Mustafa was not a member of the Brotherhood at that time, but the young Egyptian student appears to have been radicalized by his experience with the police.Maggi Michael and Hamza Hendawi,\\"Suspect in Egypt chapel bombing had 2014 run-in with police\\", Associated Press; Retrieved 12 December 2016. The Egyptian Interior Ministry produced a statement asserting that the Cairo attack was organized and carried out by terrorists led by Mohab Mostafa El-Sayed Kassem, which the Ministry said had links to Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Sinai Province. The ministry claimed that Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood fugitives in Qatar had provided financing and logistical support. However, both the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Qatar have denied that they had any role in the bombing. Mustafa once visited Qatar on 3 December 2015 but headed back to Cairo on 1 February 2016. He had never been detained by Qatari authorities as they received no requests from Egypt to detain him. By early 2017 eight suspects had been arrested for the bombing. Reactions =Egyptian= Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian President, said \\"Vicious terrorism is being waged against the country's Copts and Muslims. Egypt will emerge stronger and more united from this situation.\\" Sisi also declared a national period of mourning for three days. Pope Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria sought to heal any sectarian friction caused by the attack, saying it \\"is not just a disaster for the Church but a disaster for the whole nation.\\" Tawadros cut short his trip to Greece and arrived in Cairo that evening. Bishop Youssef of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States issued a press release saying the church would be fasting and praying \\"not for the martyrs\\" but for the healing of the Egyptian people and for Muslims and Christians to live peacefully together. On 12 December President Sisi and Coptic Pope Tawadros led the funeral procession, after the Coptic Pope officiated over the funeral. Egyptian journalist and talk show host, Amr Adib, interviewed survivors and interviewed the doctors who reconstructed the bomber's face from the pieces that were left at the scene. Doctors described and showed the bomber's head, in graphic detail, even lifting it and opening and closing his mouth, and showed how they had to stuff his head with cotton because it was empty. They explained to the On Ent channel TV audience what can be accomplished through DNA analysis. Azza Radwan Sedky, an Egyptian academic who wrote Cairo Rewind about the Egyptian Revolution, wrote \\"An Open Letter to a Suicide Bomber\\" saying: > I hope you understand the consequences of your atrocious act.

With Ugo Mattei (UC Hastings, Ca., and Turin U., Italy), Bussani developed an innovative comparative law methodology, mixing Rudolf B. Schlesinger‚Äôs and Rodolfo Sacco‚Äôs revolutionary findings on comparative legal studies. This new methodology is embodied in ‚ÄòThe Common Core of European Private Law Project‚Äô, a project which aims to unearth, through an approach based on factual questionnaires, what is common and what is divergent between European private laws. A network of more than three hundreds European and non-European scholars participates in the project, and the latter‚Äôs results are collected in volumes published by Cambridge University Press in a peer-reviewed series named after the title of the project itself, under the direction of Bussani and Mattei. In recent years, Bussani successfully turned his mastery of comparative law methods on more public-attuned themes, starting pioneering investigations on international financial law, the comparative law of human rights, and legal globalization(s).Il diritto dell‚ÄôOccidente.

The film released on 25 June 2017 all over Kerala. Plot The film opens with Gautham being an asocial man, very different from his college days. His father asks Gautham's college friends Rexxie and Jyothish to help him. Coming to know that Gautham insulted a girl during a date at the public library for which her father called him gay as he wasn't interested in females, the two go to his office. But Gautham treats them rather formally. Then they see his boss shouting at him and he listens to it patiently, which they found difficult to believe because he was unlike the Gautham they had heard of. They find out that he isn't gay. Their college days are revealed showing Gautham being a very social person. He was the lead singer of a band named 'Role Models' which consisted of Rexxie, Jyothish and Subhan, a flirt. They were best friends and everyone liked them but Gautham's parents disliked their son being with them. Then it is revealed that Gautham's parents gave a complaint to the principal with Gautham's signature which Gautham signed when he was drunk. As a result, the three were expelled. Gautham tries to explain to them that it wasn't him who gave the complaint and that they all knew each other's secrets and they should not break up. But Subhan asks him in anger why he kept his love affair a secret and the others are surprised. Eventually, they are separated. Rexxie and Jyothish tell Gautham that Subhan was having cancer and that he wants to meet Gautham which was a lie. Gautham goes with them to Subhan's place. Subhan has become a football player and is still a bachelor. Rexxie asks with whom Gautham had a love affair and Subhan tells that it was Christy, a tomboy who they all know. Then it is shown that Christy had written a love letter to Gautham which was caught by the principal. The three of them bring back Christy, who is getting married in a month.

During the Sui dynasty Li Daliang was from Jingyang, close to Daxing, the Sui dynasty capital (which would become Chang'an, the Tang dynasty capital after 618). His great-grandfather Li Yan () had been a Minister of Revenue () during Northern Wei, and his father Li Chongjie () was a local commander-in-chief () in the Sui dynasty. Li Daliang was talented in both the books and martial arts at an early age. In 617, he was serving under general Pang Yu () near the eastern capital Luoyang, when he was defeated and captured by rebels under Li Mi. The other 100 plus captives were all executed, but Li Daliang was somehow spared by the rebel general Zhang Bi (), who befriended him. Under Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan) In 618, Li Daliang joined Li Yuan (posthumously known as Emperor Gaozu) who founded the Tang dynasty. He was appointed county magistrate of Tumen (ÂúüÈñÄ, roughly modern Fuping County, Shaanxi), which was then ravished by famine and bandits. Li Daliang sold his horses to aid the poor and needy, encouraged farming, and led his soldiers to eradicate bandits. When Li Yuan's son Li Shimin passed through the area, he was very impressed with what he saw and heard, so he rewarded Li Daliang with horses and fabrics. Once, knowing that he couldn't resist an incursion by a large G√∂kt√ºrks force numbering more than 1,000 men, Li Daliang went to the enemy camp by himself on a horse. He spoke at length about the risks and rewards, and persuaded the G√∂kt√ºrks to submit. He slaughtered his horse, feasted with the tribesmen, and returned to Tumen on foot. The Tang emperor was very pleased by his accomplishment, and promoted Li Daliang to Adjutant of Area Command () in Jin Prefecture. In 620, Li Daliang participated in the campaign against warlord Wang Shichong, leading an army towards Xiangyang defended by Wang Shichong's nephew Wang Honglie (). He captured over 10 cities, and killed Wang Shichong's general Guo Da'an (). For his success, Li Yuan appointed him governor of An Prefecture. In 623, Li Daliang was named Pacification Commissioner () and sent with an army to Gu«éng Prefecture to pacify the area. On his way, he was in Jiujiang when Fu Gongshi rebelled against Tang. Li Daliang immediately led his men towards Hong Prefecture, defended by Fu Gongshi's general Zhang Shan'an (). With their armies on opposite sides of the Gan River, Li Daliang talked to Zhang Shan'an and tried to induce him to surrender. Zhang Shan'an said he was pressured by his soldiers into rebelling, and he wasn't sure whether he would be punished if he surrendered. Li Daliang said, \\"Commander-in-Chief Zhang, if you plan to surrender, then we are family.\\" He alone crossed the river on his horse, took Zhang Shan'an's hands and gained his trust. Zhang Shan'an agreed to surrender, and went to Li Daliang's camp with more than 10 cavalrymen. Li Daliang asked the cavalrymen to stay outside while he led Zhang Shan'an inside. After chatting for a while, Li Daliang ordered his soldiers to detain Zhang Shan'an, as the cavalrymen outside fled. After a while, Zhang Shan'an's soldiers arrived and demanded Li Daliang return their general. Li Daliang had someone tell them that Zhang Shan'an didn't want to return because he was serious about surrendering. Zhang Shan'an's soldiers thought they were betrayed and deserted, so they all scattered. Li Daliang led his men to capture many of them. Zhang Shan'an was delivered to Chang'an (and eventually killed). In February 624, Li Daliang led his soldiers to You Prefecture (Áå∑Â∑û; around modern Xuancheng), where Fu Gongshi had laid a siege. He defeated Fu Gongshi to save You Prefecture. After Fu Gongshi was killed soon after, the emperor rewarded Li Daliang with hundreds of maidservants, but Li Daliang set them all free, saying: When Li Yuan heard of this, he gasped in admiration, but resent him another 20 girls. Afterwards Li Daling served as Commander-in- Chief () of Yue Prefecture. Under Emperor Taizong of Tang (Li Shimin) Li Shimin (posthumously known as Emperor Taizong) became the Tang emperor in 626. The following year Li Daliang was assigned to Jiaozhou. When he left his post in Yue Prefecture, he left behind hundreds of volumes of his writing as he felt they would help his successors. Later he returned to the capital to serve as Chief Minister of the Court of the Imperial Treasury (), before being sent out to Liang Prefecture in the western parts of the empire as Commander-in- Chief. In 629, an emperor's messenger arrived and noticed a magnificent eagle in Li's possession. To ingratiate himself to Li, he advised Li to present it to the emperor as a gift. Li Daliang then secretly wrote a letter to the emperor, which said: The emperor praised Li Daguang's loyalty and honesty, and wrote this reply: \\"What is there for me to worry about if I have ministers like you!\\" He also endowed Li Daliang with a foreign vase in his personal possession, as well as the historical text Annals of Han () written by Xun Yue in the Han dynasty. In 630, Illig Qaghan was captured as the G√∂kt√ºrk tribesmen scattered in the Yiwu region (around modern Hami City, Xinjiang). Li Shimin appointed Li Daliang Pacification Commissioner of the Xibei Circuit () to induce the surrenders of the Turkic chieftains. Li Shimin had wanted to win over chieftains by providing them with food, cloth and titles, with the plan of resettling them south of the Yellow River. Li Daliang opposed the idea, and wrote a memorial in which he said, Li Shimin listened to his advice and left the G√∂kt√ºrks outside of Tang's border. In 634, Li Daliang was sent to Jiannan Circuit as an Inspection Commissioner (). He attacked corruption and promoted good government, earning the approval of the common people. Later that year, Li Shimin decided to carry out a major campaign against the hostile western neighbor Tuyuhun. Li Daliang was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Hedong Circuit under general Li Jing. The force led by Li Jing, Li Daliang, and general Xue Wanjun () which headed northwest defeated the Tuyuhun main army the following year, as Li Daliang captured more than 20 nobles and more than 50,000 livestock animals in a battle near Mount Shuhun (ËúÄÊ∏æÂ±±; probably around modern Gonghe County, Qinghai). The Tuyuhun khan Murong Fuyun fled (and was killed in flight), and his son Murong Shun surrendered. Li Shimin created Murong Shun a khan to succeed his father and pulled the main Tang army out of Tuyuhun, but Li Daliang with a few thousand men were temporarily left behind to support Murong Shun‚Äîwho was unpopular with his people‚Äîuntil Murong Shun's assassination a few months after. For his merits in this campaign, Li Daliang received a sumptuous gift including 150 maidservants from the emperor, but he gave everything to his relatives. At some point Li Daliang was appointed General-in-Chief of the Right Guard () in the capital Chang'an. In winter 641, the G√∂kt√ºrks under Qilibi Khan (a vassal of the Tang resettled in the Ordos Loop) were attacked by Xueyantuo people under Zhenzhu Khan, and Li Shimin sent Li Daliang and other generals to aid Qilibi Khan, with Li Shiji in overall command. A few months later, the Tang army dealt a major blow to the Xueyantuo troops, which fled back to their territory. In May 643, Li Shimin created his son Li Zhi his crown prince, and Li Daliang was appointed Right Defense Guard Commander for the Crown Prince () while retaining his post with the Imperial Guards. In September 643, Li Daliang was also appointed Minister of Works (). With three concurrent appointments, Li Daliang worked even harder to guard both the emperor's and the crown prince's palaces, often sleeping upright for entire nights when his soldiers were on duty. Li Shimin would say: ‚ÄúWhen you, sir, are on duty, I can sleep soundly through the night.‚Äù Fang Xuanling, the grand councilor, also praised Li Daliang greatly, even comparing him to the virtuous Han dynasty ministers Wang Ling () and Zhou Bo. It was around this time Li Daliang reencountered Zhang Bi, the general who spared his life in the Sui dynasty, by chance on the street. With tears in his eyes, he held Zhang Bi's hands and humbly offered him all his money. Zhang Bi refused. Li Daliang then told the emperor how indebted he was to Zhang Bi, and the emperor promoted Zhang Bi from a Palace Construction Aide () to Commander-in-Chief of Dai Prefecture as a result. Li Daliang was praised for remembering and repaying the kindness he had received. In November 644, as Li Shimin prepared to lead an army against Goguryeo, he went to Luoyang and appointed Li Daliang vice-governor of the capital Chang'an, under governor Fang Xuanling who had spoken highly of him. But soon Li Daming fell ill. When Li Shimin heard of it, he personally prepared medicine and ordered it delivered to him by the relay system, but Li Daliang's symptoms did not improve. On his deathbed, Li Daliang wrote a petition to the emperor, advising him to abandon the campaign against Goguryeo and instead focus on properly managing the Chang'an area. (The first campaign in the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War in 645 turned out to be a failure.) When news of his death reached Li Shimin, the emperor broke down and cried. Imperial sessions were suspended for three days, and Li Daliang received the posthumous name \\"Yi\\" (Êáø; meaning \\"virtuous\\") as well as many posthumous titles. Li Daliang had lived simply so that when he died there was no jade or pearl at home to put in his coffin as was the tradition. Instead, he was buried with only rice and cloth. In fact, Li Daliang had spent a lot of money giving proper burials to relatives without offspring. He had also helped raise so many orphans, that 15 people not his own children mourned him like their father during the funeral. Li Daliang was buried in Zhao Mausoleum, where Li Shimin would later also be buried.

History In 1919 a committee was formed to establish a cottage hospital. Archibald Cook designed the building the following year. A range of gifts and donations allowed the hospital to be established with two four-bedded wards, two single rooms, a consulting room and an operating theatre. An official opening ceremony was held on 8 July 1922. A maternity ward was added in 1930. During the Second World War the hospital took civilian and military casualties. In 1948, following the formation of the NHS in Scotland, the hospital was run by the Board of Management for Isle of Arran Hospitals. In 1972, after some campaigning by the community, an eight-bed extension was built. In 1974 responsibility passed to North Ayrshire and Arran District of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board. Around 1980 a modern surgical theatre was installed and in 1981 a part-time general surgeon was appointed but within two years his hours were being reduced. Two new single rooms were added in 2011. In July 2013, the health board commissioned a new biomass boiler, fuelled by woodchips from locally grown timber. The dental facility at the hospital was refurbished and extended in 2013.

She is known for her participation in the civil disobedience movements of the 1930s and 1940s, which contributed to the independence of India.  Early life  Kiran Bala Bora was born in 1904 in the village of North Haiborgaon in Nagaon district of Assam to Kamal Chandra Pandit and Saroj Aidew. Kamal Chandra Pandit, her father, was a school teacher. Kiran studied in school till the 3rd standard despite of the prevalent restrictions on sending women to school in Indian society at the time. It was at an early age when she was married to Saki Ram Laskar of Paroli Guri, Kampur, Nagaon and also lost her husband soon after. Kamal Chandra then brought Kiran back home along with Kiran's young daughter. It was during her teen years that she gained interest in the revolutionary movements of the country.  Contribution to India's Freedom Movement  =The 1920s= The summer of 1920 saw the resurgence of the idea that India should gain independence from British rule, especially after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Led by Gandhi, hundreds of people participated in non-violent protests across India. Kiran was inspired by the sacrifices and challenges being endured by the leaders of the independence struggle and decided to participate. She started involving herself in the activities of the movement and gradually devoted all her time for it. Her efforts towards fundraising was a major factor that helped Congress gain momentum in north-eastern part of India. Encouragement and co-operation from leaders like Purna Chandra Sharma, Mahidhar Bora, Haladhar Bhuyan, & Devakanta Baruah helped her turn into a strong freedom fighter. During this time, she also met Chandraprava Saikiani, a great writer, social reformer and freedom fighter from Assam. Kiran established a close relationship with her and worked for a lot of social causes under her directions. Kiran Bala Bora involved herself with activity of boycotting the use of foreign goods, one of the objectives of the Non- cooperation movement. In one such incident, she burnt all kinds of valuable foreign goods of her own house including clothes and then lead others to do the same. Instead of buying clothes manufactured in Europe, she started spinning cotton and making her own cloth. She also worked against the use of narcotic substances like opium and bhang. The Lahore Congress, in 1929, resolved to celebrate 26 January 1930, as purna swaraaj (or Complete Independence) day. Accordingly, more than 400 women in Koliabor, led in part by Kiran Bala, joined in the celebrations, in defiance of the government. Police stopped the women from participating, and many were allegedly beaten up. =The 1930s= Kiran was arrested by the British-Indian government for violation of laws several times. She fell severely ill on 7 February 1931 when she was in jail and was released after 4 months. In 1932, she was transferred to Shillong Jail where she lived in dire conditions. Despite the hardships faced during such days she spent in captivity, she kept working towards making India independent. It was during these times that Kiran met Ambika Kakati Aidew, another freedom fighter from Assam. Ambika's daughter, Jagyashini Kakati Aidew, had passed and Ambika proposed Kiran to marry her son-in-law, Sanat Ram Bora. Kiran's father accepted Ambika's proposal and remarried his daughter while she was still involved in the freedom movement. Sanat Ram Bora had five young children from his previous wife and lived in a joint family. Also, being the founder secretary of a newly established spiritual/religious Srimanta Sankaradeva Sangha (Sankardev Community), his house was always frequented by devotees and visitors who were interested to know and learn about the culture of this Sangha. Kiran took to handle the responsibility of her joint family including the children from Sanat's first marriage. She also served the devotees with open-heartedness and derived utmost pleasure in doing so. Thus, she earned the love and respect of all in her new family and at the same time relieved her husband of a lot of homely responsibilities. Her husband, in turn, granted full independence to Kiran and supported her entirely in her political life. In the 1930s, Gandhi had started the Civil Disobedience Movement to end the monopoly by British on salt. Kiran went from door to door explaining about this movement to the villagers of Polaxoni (the place where her spouse Sanat Ram Bora lived), gathering people and continued her activities of collecting food and other relief items. Kiran continued devoting herself to the service of the country and also fulfilling her homely responsibilities. She remained an active participant of the independence struggle.

The film's power of conviction owed much to the real-life Bill Blewitt, the village postmaster.Harry Watt's first meeting with Bill Blewitt Others recall him as having \\"a mesmeric gift of the gab, a glorious Cornish accent, twinkling blue eyes, a grin as broad as 'Popeye' and the charismatic charm of the Celt.\\" Ealing's salt-of-the-earth film star, The Guardian 13 March 2009 Set during the economic slump of the 1930s, the film follows two fishermen who have lost their boat but manage to save enough to buy another with the help of the Post Office Savings Bank. The inter-village squabbles and references to unemployment reflected the actual hardships of the Cornish fishing villages, whose pilchard industry had been suffered from Britain's refusal to trade with Mussolini's Italy. The film was shown around the whole of Britain, often at church halls and other meeting rooms and was generally was well received.\\"Teaching thrift by means of a scenic film\\", Aberdeen Press and Journal, 8 June 1937. On its showing in the village of Mousehole itself, the Post Office Magazine reported that the film caused such excitement amongst villagers that much of the dialogue could not be heard above the chatter.\\"How local film was viewed at Mousehole\\", Western Morning News, 5 June 1939 At the end of a showing in nearby Penzance Bill Blewitt and his wife, who also appeared, stepped onto the stage to be greeted by deafening cheers and hand clapping.\\"Post Office film at Penzance, The Cornishman and Cornish Telegraph, 14 January 1937. Cast * Bill Blewitt * Villagers of Mousehole Critique Against this hardship, the film's promotion of saving with the Post Office occupies a rather ambiguous place. The administrators of the post office savings account are unreal and over-earnest comic figures. Their intrusions into what is an otherwise realistic story have a dream-like quality at odds with the film's otherwise gently comic flow. Influence Acclaimed by film maker Paul Rotha as the first 'story' documentary, The Saving of Bill Blewitt influenced populist Ealing comedies such as Whisky Galore! and the films of Mike Leigh. The real-life Bill Blewitt went on to appear in several other story-documentaries and wartime propaganda films as The Foreman Went to France and Harry's Watt's Nine Men.

The station is surrounded by a residential area. History The first summer houses were constructed in the area in 1898. In the same year, a railway station, Platform of the 10th versta () was open to serve the houses. In 1904, a settlement of Losinoostrovsky was officially established. The name came from the nearby Losiny Ostrov Forest, currently Losiny Ostrov National Park. In 1908, the Moscow Encircle Railway was completed, and the Platform of the 10th versta, renamed to Losinoostrovskaya, became a large freight station. In addition to the freight yard, there was a locomotive depot. In November 1924, the settlement of Losinoostrovsky was renamed Losinoostrovsk and was granted a town status. In 1939 it was renamed Babushkin, after Mikhail Babushkin, and in 1960, Babushkin was merged into Moscow. In 1929, the railway line between Moscow and Mytishchi, including Losinoostrovskaya, was electrified. In 1900, a railway line connecting Beskudnikovo and Losinoostrovskaya was constructed. This was done in order to facilitate the railway traffic between Moscow and Kimry (Savyolovo), since Moscow Savyolovsky railway station was not open yet.

The film makers challenged the conventions of documentary, casting non-professionals, as they had in their previous film The Saving of Bill Blewitt. In the same style, North Sea employed minimal narration and relies on action, dialogue and characterisation to tell its story. Synopsis The John Gillman, a deep-sea castle-class trawler is damaged during a storm in the North Sea and seeks help from the Wick coastguard. Eventually, after a struggle against the elements, the dangers are overcome, and the ship returns safely to harbour. The film was based on an incident in 1937 when an Aberdeen trawler got into distress and was saved through their radio distress calls. Critique The portrayal of real fishermen and their lifestyle is the film's strength. The men are able to speak out and act themselves, rather than have their lives interpreted by professional middle-class actors. Nevertheless, the 'cast' did use some scripted dialogue devised by Watt, who, like many from the Documentary Film Movement, came from a middle-class background. As a consequence, dialogue and characterisation often appears inauthentic and unconvincing. Influence North Sea was the GPO Unit's second dramatised documentary, following from The Saving of Bill Blewitt. It provided a second role for the real-life Bill Blewitt, the Cornish postman who had proved a star turn in the first film. North Sea proved popularSwann, Paul, The British Documentary Film Movement, 1926-1946, Cambridge University Press, 1989 and was to lead to a number of feature-length dramatised documentaries during the 1940s, including Target for Tonight, Coastal Command, Fires Were Started, and Western Approaches.

Published in 1991, this speculative fiction vampire novel follows the experiences of a black bisexual heroine whose power and morality challenge assumptions about the vampire myth. Readers see this central character travel through time and lead multiple lives. In her first life, she is an unnamed runaway slave in Louisiana in 1850. After killing a bounty hunter in self- defense, she is rescued by Gilda, a vampire who runs a brothel named Woodard's. The women at the brothel educate her, become her family, and introduce her to vampirism and eternal life. Eventually, she becomes a vampire herself and adopts Gilda's name. The novel follows by providing historical vignettes of different cities and time periods, which highlight key moments in Gilda's life. She is in California in 1890, Missouri in 1921, Massachusetts in 1955, New York in 1981, New Hampshire in 2020, and the \\"Land of Enchantment\\" in 2050.

In the , Gleneagle had a population of 1877 people. Geography The Logan River and the Mount Lindesay Highway pass through eastern parts of locality. Large sections of land are rural with some parts used for irrigated agriculture. A housing estate was established to the east of the highway. In the centre of Gleneagle is a large man-made dam called Lake Brabazon. The western boundary follows the Sydney‚ÄìBrisbane railway line. History The locality takes its name from a cotton farm called Glen Eagles established in the 1860s by William Tutin Walker (1833-1920). Walker began as a manager on Townsvale established by Robert Towns who pioneered cotton growing in the Logan River valley. Townsvale was in the area of the present-day localities of Gleneagle and Veresdale. After Towns' death, Walker took over Townsvale. St Joseph's Catholic Church was the first Catholic church in the Logan River valley and was opened in 1876 on a site, then known as Tullamore Hill, later as Veresdale, and now within Gleneagle. The site for the church was donated by William Rafter, whose residence was called Tullamore after his home town Tullamore in Ireland. Tullamore was the major centre of the district (prior to the rise of Beaudesert as the major centre). A cemetery was established behind the church. On 2 June 1889 Roman Catholic Archbishop Robert Dunne blessed the Catholic cemetery (now known as the Gleneagle Catholic Cemetery). In 1936 the church was lined and ceiled for the first time. By the early 1950s the smal church was in poor repair and it had a very small congregation (St Mary's Catholic Church in Beaudesert was very large and by then the major town of the district). At that time, Mass was being held regularly at the O'Reilly Guesthouse in Goblin Wood, the private home of Bernard O'Reilly. So it was decided to relocate St Joseph's to the O'Reilly Guesthouse as a permanent church. It was dismantled, transported and re-assembled. On 27 November 1955, Father Steele presided over the first Mass in the relocated church () and Archbishop James Duhig performed the opening ceremony. Although privately owned by the O'Reilly family, it is still strongly associated with the Beaudesert Catholic parish. In 1983 the Catholic cemetery at Waterford West was sold by the Catholic Church for re-development; graves marked with headstones were exhumed and relocated to Gleneagle Catholic Cemetery. Gleneagle railway station () was on the disused Beaudesert railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert. The line opened on 16 May 1888. Gleneagle Provisional School opened on 18 March 1891. It closed circa 1899. In 1902 it reopened as Gleneagle Provisional School and on 1 January 1909 became Gleneagle State School. Allen's Creek Provisional School opened on 4 October 1927 and closed on 18 September 1929. It was a railway camp school and provided schooling for children of workers building the Sydney‚ÄìBrisbane rail corridor. Allan's Creek (as it is currently spelled) crosses the railway line at the intersection of three present-day localities: Allenview, Bromelton and Gleneagle.  Education  Gleneagle State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 126-146 Mount Lindesay Highway (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 211 students with 17 teachers (14 full-time equivalent) and 9 non-teaching staff (5 full-time equivalent). There is no secondary school in Gleneagle; the nearest one is Beaudesert State High School in neighbouring Beaudesert. Demographics Gleneagle has a population of 1877 at the . The locality contains 651 households, in which 48.9% of the population are males and 51.1% of the population are females with a median age of 33, 5 years below the national average. The average weekly household income is $1,332, $106 below the national average. 3.7% of Gleneagle's population is either of Aborigional or Torres Strait Islander descent. 62.4% of the population aged 15 or over is either registered or de facto married, while 37.6% of the population is not married. 31.9% of the population is currently attending some form of a compulsory education.

The melody known today appeared first in the Rheinfelsisches Gesangbuch of 1666. The song is focused on the longing for the arrival of a Saviour. It has been included in both Catholic and Protestant hymnals; in Protestant hymnals sometimes with an added seventh stanza of unknown authorship. It is part of the Catholic Gotteslob as GL 231, of the Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 7, in the ' as RG 361,. in the ' as EM 141, in the hymnal ' as FL 189, and in the ' as MG 244.  Theme and text  The song is based on a verse in the Book of Isaiah, in the Latin text from the Vulgate that the author knew \\"Rorate coeli de super, et nubes pluant justum: aperiatur terra, et germinet Salvatorem\\" which was set in the Gregorian chant Rorate caeli. The beginning is related to another verse by Isaiah: \\"Ach dass du den Himmel zerrissest und f√ºhrest herab, dass die Berge vor dir zerfl√∂ssen\\" From the fourth stanza on, the believers appear as a \\"we\\" (wir), describing the miserable conditions that need to change. Added later and first appeared in David Gregor Corner's collection in 1631:  Melody and settings  First print of the melody, Rheinfelsisches Gesangbuch 1666 The melody in Dorian mode appears first in the Rheinfelsisches Gesangbuch of 1666. It may have been composed especially for the text. The hymn was set to music by composers such as Johannes Brahms, Johann Nepomuk David, Hugo Distler and Johannes Weyrauch.

Nevertheless, her works have also been considered ‚Äúsurreal‚Äù and not constricted by form. √Ösa Hellman writes in the book Taidekeramiikka Suomessa [Ceramic art in Finland]: \\"Johanna Rytk√∂l√§'s works immediately drew attention when she started to participate in exhibitions in the 1980s. The public was used to associating sculpture with stone, bronze, plaster or wood. While clay sculptures had for long been made by Finnish ceramicists they had often had a more industrial design and decorative flavor. Johanna Rytk√∂l√§ presented completely abstract artworks, closer to traditional sculpture in form and expression but still based on mastery of ceramic techniques.\\" thumb With her mastery of the techniques of ceramics, Rytk√∂l√§ has been seen to continue the tradition of Finnish ceramic art but also to stand out due to her stance associated with sculpture.Aav, Marianne: Esipuhe.

It was part of the campaign of the Main and ended with a Prussian victory. Preliminary campaign After the Prussian Mainarmee (German for: army of the river Main) had beaten the Bavarians at Kissingen, the Bavarian army retreated to W√ºrzburg. The Prussians now turned west against the VIIIth Federal Corps (troops of W√ºrttemberg, Baden, Hesse and Nassau) which protected Frankfurt. After the VIIIth Corps had lost combats at Frohnhofen and Aschaffenburg it gave up the defence of Frankfurt and went south-eastward to unite with the Bavarians at the river Tauber.

The Prussians occupied northern W√ºrttemberg and negotiated a peace in August 1866. W√ºrttemberg paid an indemnity of 8,000,000 gulden, and concluded a secret offensive and defensive treaty with her conqueror. Although not officially part of the North German Confederation, the secret treaty effectively bound W√ºrttemberg to Prussia.

B. Hughes Herbert Bristow Hughes (c. 1821 ‚Äì 19 May 1892), generally referred to as \\"H. B. Hughes\\", was a pioneer pastoralist in the colony of South Australia. History Hughes was born in England, a younger brother of Timothy Bristow Hughes, a leading cotton trader in Liverpool for over fifty years, and John Bristow Hughes, who emigrated to Australia from India, and arrived in South Australia from Hobart aboard Porter in February 1841. J. B. Hughes took up land at Emu Flat, around south-west of Clare. Another brother, named Bristow Herbert Hughes joined J. B. Hughes some time before January 1842. Envisaging a bright future in the new colony, they called for H. B. Hughes, who arrived in Adelaide aboard Davidsons in May 1843. The Hughes brothers selected of land, stretching from Crystal Brook in the south-west to Yacka in the south-east, up to Mount Lock and Mannanarie in the north-east across nearly to Mount Remarkable and down the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges back to Crystal Brook. They divided the country into three lots, J. B. Hughes taking the south-eastern portion, which he named \\"Bundaleer\\", and later sold to Maslin? in 1854 to Charles Brown Fisher; the middle section shared by H. B. Hughes and Bristow Herbert Hughes and named \\"Booyoolee\\" (often mis- spelled Booyoolie); the northern end taken by the White brothers, a family with which they had a long relationship and whose sister Hughes was to marry. The White brothers had abandoned the Port Lincoln area after several years of fear and disappointment. They later sold their lease to George Tinline. The White brothers are here mis-spelled \\"Whyte\\". At Booyoolee station, which included some of the best land on the Rocky River, near Mount Remarkable and Gladstone, H. B. Hughes with his brother, who later retired, bred cattle, sheep and horses. He went further north, and founded Nockatunga station on Wilson's River, near Cooper's Creek in Queensland, near the SA/NSW border, from where he drove mobs of cattle to his lucerne paddocks in Netley to fatten up for the Adelaide market. Many of the properties he owned freehold, which proved an advantage when various governments began resuming the larger leasehold properties for closer development. He also owned the Kinchega run on the Darling River in New South Wales. As his sons grew up they took over management of his various properties. The eldest, Herbert White Hughes, took over Booyoolee Estate, where he had a fine residence. Arthur and Harold managed Kinchega cattle station, which they later diverted to running sheep. He was one of the first pastoralists to employ paddocking, using wire fences. Hughes was a pioneer of the meat-preserving industry in South Australia. He established extensive meat canning factories at Booyoolee and on the Port River, using machinery he imported from England. He was also a pioneer of Murray-Darling river transport. The paddle-steamer Decoy and her barges Reliance and Croupier were built for him in Glasgow and brought out in sections, and were used for the carriage of stock and wool from his up-river properties to Morgan. He was appointed justice of the peace and Special Magistrate in 1856, but had no time for politics and public affairs. He was perhaps best known as a breeder of horses. Among the thoroughbreds he imported from England were Croupier and Leonidas, which became the sires of several champion racehorses. Another noted horse in his stable was Sir Edmund, which he purchased from William Blackler, and whose progeny, such as Simpleton, Hughes gave names starting with \\"S\\". He was a prominent member of the South Australian Jockey Club. In 1864 Hughes purchased for his wife the grand residence \\"Athelney\\" on in Hackney. \\"Athelney\\" was built in 1858 by P. D. Prankerd, a man closely associated with St. Peter's College. It was the setting for much liberal hospitality. When Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, on his Australia tour visited St. Peter's College in October 1867, he had lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Hughes at \\"Athelney\\". It was later the residence of Edgar Bristow Hughes, and remained in the family for many years. Although focused on the residence, this article appears a more reliable reference than others. He died after a short illness, and was buried at the North Road Cemetery on Saturday, 21 May. The list of those attending the ceremony reads like a \\"Who's Who\\" of the colony. Family Hughes married Laura White (c. 1829 ‚Äì 5 January 1909) in England in 1854, and named the town of Laura for her.

Hughes was related to Sir Walter Watson Hughes (1803‚Äì1887), pastoralist and founder of the University of Adelaide, are hard to verify, and may be disregarded. =White family= Laura, a daughter of Samuel White-White, had five brothers who arrived in South Australia in December 1839 aboard William Barrass: Samuel White, farmer and flour miller, who married Eliza O'Halloran, daughter of T. S. O'Halloran in 1853; Frederick White; Edwin White; William White; and Alfred White, who died shortly after arrival in South Australia. White's River and White's Flat, near Port Lincoln were named for them. Edwin (who was called Thomas on the William Barrass passenger list) and William may have returned early to England; Samuel and Frederick are remembered as the pioneering White brothers of Wirrabara. Laura's elder sister Elizabeth Hagen White ( ‚Äì 28 October 1881) in 1861 married William Herbert Squires ( ‚Äì 30 November 1911), a senior SA public servant.

The executions took place in the aftermath of the Battle of St√•ngebro (September 1598) and the de facto deposition of the Polish and Swedish King Sigismund III Vasa as King of Sweden by his uncle, the Swedish regent Duke Charles. After the Battle of St√•ngebro, the forces of Duke Charles laid siege to Kalmar, which was controlled by the loyalists of Sigismund. The city fell after a month, and after a further month, Kalmar Castle was taken on 12 May. The victory was followed by the execution of 22 people as Sigismund loyalists without trial. The heads of the governors were placed on poles above the Western city gate.

In January 2014, Irish Water took over management of the project which is currently in the Planning Stage. In 2016 it was proposed that over two million people will benefit from the water supplying not only Dublin but also an area including Arklow, Athlone, Athy, Carlow, Drogheda, Mullingar, Navan, Portaloise and Tullamore. In 2018 Irish Water announced plans to seek planning permission for the project. Project now under review The proposed pipeline has now been sent for review by the CRU, Irish Water‚Äôs economic regulator, amid questions about Irish Water‚Äôs leakage targets, whether groundwater was appropriately considered as an alternative to the pipeline, and the cost of the proposal. Environmental and economic concerns Various groups are opposing the pipeline on, among other things, economic and environmental grounds. The River Shannon Protection Alliance, Fight the Pipe and Kennedy Analysis have been the most vocal opponents. One of the key arguments of those objecting to the pipeline is that if Irish Water met its own leakage reduction targets in Dublin there would be no need for the pipeline at all. Kennedy Analysis appeared before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government (alongside Irish Water) in April 2018 to debate the proposed pipeline. Ireland has extremely high levels of leakage - according to Irish Water‚Äôs 2015 business plan network leakage alone (i.e. leakage on the distribution side of the network, not including any household leakage) was 49%.https://www.water.ie/docs/Irish-Water-Business-Plan.pdf Average leakage in cities around the globe is considerably lower than this ‚Äì a 2017 KPMG study of 35 studies globally found that average leakage was 10-13%.https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2017/10/benchmarking-city- services.pdf Preferred route In November 2016 the Parteen Basin to the south of the lough was chosen as the proposed site of extraction. Water would be pumped via Birdhill to a break pressure tank at Knockanacree near Cloughjordan, all in County Tipperary and gravity fed from there to Peamount in Dublin. Concerns Various groups have been formed by those challenging the pipe. As the proposed extraction of water upstream of the ESB's hydroelectric station at Ardnacrusha may reduce the flow available for the generation of electricity, Irish Water will compensate ESB for any loss.

He was known for his studies on theoretical and experimental structural geology and was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, and the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences in 1977.  Biography  Jadavpur University Born on 1 March 1932 in the Indian state of West Bengal, S. K. Ghosh graduated in science (BSc) from University of Kolkata and after completing a master's degree from the same institution, he joined his alma mater as a member of the faculty of geology in 1958. Simultaneously, enrolled at Presidency College, Kolkata for his doctoral studies under the guidance of Santosh Kumar Ray and secured a PhD working on the time-correlation of the structural and metamorphic histories of the terrain in Kuilapal village in Purulia District. Subsequently, he moved to Uppsala University where he worked under Hans Ramberg, a renowned geologist who would later lend his name to Rambergite mineral. He stayed with Ramberg for two years at the end of which period he received the degree of Filosofisk doktorgrad from Uppsala University in 1967 and returned to join Jadavpur University where he set up an experimental laboratory to continue his researches. He served the university till his superannuation in 1997 but continued his association post-retirement as an emeritus professor, an INSA senior scientist and as an INSA honorary scientist. During this period, he also had a short stint in Sweden as a research associate for the Swedish National Programme for the Geodynamics Project. Ghosh was married to Sheila and the couple had a son, Abhik Ghosh, a professor of chemistry at UiT ‚Äì The Arctic University of Norway. He died on 30 October 2008, at the age of 76.  Legacy  Boudinage Focusing his attention on the theoretical and experimental aspects of structural geology, Ghosh studied the geometrical relationships of the axial surfaces of folds with the principal planes of deformation and his researches assisted in the wider understanding of the geological phenomena such as superposed buckle folding, buckling due to constructional deformation, rotation of spherical and ellipsoidal inclusions in shear zones, deformation of early lineations, chocolate tablet boudinage and evolution of shear zone structures. A theory on conglomerate deformation and an analysis of the mechanism of distortion of planar structure around rigid bodies have been credited to him. His researches have been documented as a book, Structural Geology: Fundamentals and Modern Developments, as chapters in books edited by others and as over 50 peer-reviewed articles, the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed a number of them. He also published a field guide for field research in Ghatsila. He served as a National professor of the University Grants Commission of India during 1979‚Äì80 and sat in the editorial boards of the Journal of Structural Geology of Oxford University Press and Tectonophysics of Elsevier, besides mentoring thirteen doctoral scholars in their studies.  Awards and honors  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded Ghosh the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1977. The Indian National Science Academy elected him as their fellow in 1979, INSA would honor him again in 1998 with K. Naha Memorial Medal. The same year, the Indian Academy of Sciences also elected him as a fellow.

It represents a hugely productive, high-latitude marine ecosystem and supports one of the largest seasonal marine mammal migrations in the world, including thousands of bowhead and beluga whales, hundreds of thousands of walruses and ice seals, and millions of migratory birds. Moreover, it is home to more than 40 tribes of coastal Yup‚Äôik and Inupiaq peoples whose way of life has been linked with the marine environment for thousands of years.  History  Native villages in the northern Bering Sea region of Alaska largely practice a subsistence- based lifestyle that is inextricably tied to the rich marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea. Warming ocean temperatures, Arctic sea ice decline, and increasing ship traffic all threaten the subsistence practices and food security of these communities. The coastal tribes along the northern Bering Sea and the Bering Strait have requested that the Federal Government of the United States of America take action to protect the health of the marine ecosystems of the Northern Bering Sea and Bering Strait while maintaining opportunities for sustainable fishing and sustainable economic development.  Protection  = Shipping = Coast Guard is nearing completion of a Port Access Route Study for the region, which is the first step in assessing the need for vessel traffic control measures and developing a set of recommendations. Any recommended international routing measures would be submitted to the International Maritime Organization which sets international rules for maritime commerce. Coast Guard is directed to give careful consideration to community recommendations regarding environmentally sensitive Areas to Be Avoided and to publish its initial findings by the end of 2016 and to move its conclusions to the International Maritime Organization for action by 2018. = Fishing = Additional to the already banned bottom trawling in the region to protect the sea floor, the executive order makes it a federal policy to support the continued prohibition on bottom trawling. = Oil and gas = Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, President Obama has withdrawn Norton Bay area and portions of the St. Matthew-Hall area from future oil and gas leasing to further protect the regional ecosystem and coastal communities. The total area withdrawn from leasing through the executive order is . = Consultation = The executive order establishes the Federal Task Force on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area (Bering Task Force), under the Arctic Executive Steering Committee established by executive order 13689. The Bering Task Force will coordinate Federal activity and consider additional mechanisms to reduce impacts to subsistence and cultural activities within the Climate Resilience Area. The voice of Alaskan native tribes and the role of indigenous knowledge in decision-making within the region is elevated by mandating that the Task Force establish and engage in regular consultation with a Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council, consisting primarily of tribal government representatives with government officials for coordination purposes.

The public executions included that of the mayor of Kalmar, the city Councillors and a number of the leading burghers of Kalmar by John, King of Denmark, as retaliation for assisting the Swedes in retaking the city of Kalmar from the Danes in 1503. In 1501, John, King of Denmark, who had also been king of Sweden since four years past, was deposed by the Swedish nobility who reinstated Sten Sture the Elder. In May 1504, peace was made between Sweden and Denmark on condition that a meeting by the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian Riksr√•d were to take place in Kalmar in July 1505. When the time came, the situation in Sweden was unstable and the Swedes cancelled the meeting. King John did not accept this and traveled to Kalmar with the Danish and Norwegian riksr√•d all the same. There, he assembled a court and judged the Swedish nobles Svante Nilsson (regent of Sweden), Nils Klausson, Sten Kristersson, Trotte M√•nsson (Eka), Erik Turesson, √Öke Hansson (Thott), Erik Johansson Vasa, T√∂nne Eriksson (Thott) and Peder Turesson (Bielke) to confiscation and imprisonment for L√®se-majest√©.

Carrie makes her case to investigator Christine Lonas (Marin Hinkle), who has determined that Frannie is in imminent risk of further harm after the recent incident with Quinn. The case is presented to a judge the next day. Christine cites Quinn's volatile presence and Carrie's bipolar disorder among other things, and the judge rules in favor of child services. Frannie is put into a foster home. Quinn (Rupert Friend) wakes up in a secluded cabin with Astrid (Nina Hoss) keeping watch over him. Astrid informs him that Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) secured Quinn's release on the condition that he stays out of the public eye. Quinn is resistant and attempts to hitchhike back to New York before Astrid catches him. That night, Dar Adal stops by. Recognizing that Quinn is being tempted back to New York by Carrie's situation, Dar reveals to Quinn that Carrie made the decision to have Quinn awakened from his coma, likely causing the stroke that he suffered. Javadi (Shaun Toub) arrives in New York to report back to Saul (Mandy Patinkin). Dar arranges to have Saul delayed by the Agency on the pretence of an internal debriefing regarding his alleged meeting with Javadi in the West Bank. In the meantime, on his way to the meeting, Javadi is kidnapped by three Iranian men. They tie him in a chair and torture him while accusing him of being a traitor, saying that they have been tipped off about this from someone within the CIA. However, Amir (Alain Washnevsky), one of the Iranians, is loyal to Javadi and rescues him by shooting the other two captors; Amir reveals that he served in the Iranian military with Javadi. Javadi finally makes his meeting with Saul and demands to know who could have tipped off the Iranians that he was in New York. Saul replies that only Dar Adal could have had the knowledge. Javadi tells Saul that Nafisi confessed that he was actually working for Mossad and that his trip to Abu Dhabi and performance in Israel were a charade. Saul asks Javadi to confirm personally to the President-elect that Iran has no parallel nuclear program in North Korea. Javadi shoots and kills Amir.

History  The first edition of the Frames - Portuguese Film Festival took place in 2013 at Filmhuset in Stockholm, between 16 and 22 of November. This initiative originated from the efforts of Ung FAPS, the association of young Portuguese people in Stockholm, wishing the festival could become a significant cultural gathering platform for the Portuguese community in Sweden. The festival seeks to promote the most recent, original and creative content within the Portuguese cinematographic panorama, as well as introduce new and talented Portuguese filmmakers to the Swedish public. Cinema, the main focus of the event, is broadened by other cultural expressions, such as literature, debates and music events. Memory was the underlying subject of the 2014 edition that took place between 24 and 29 November at Filmhuset in Stockholm, with also a day session in Gothenburg, at Bio Roy movie theater. Ricardo Tr√™pa, actor and grandson of Manoel de Oliveira, the world renowned Portuguese director, was present in the edition of 2016 \\"What is memory? What does the act of remembering entail? How do we relate to our past in individual and collective ways?\\" Under Memory, several topics were addressed such as the feminist presence within Portuguese cinema, the politics of colonialism, the AIDS epidemic, and also the 40 year anniversary of the Portuguese revolution (which meant the end of the 48 year-long-dictatorship in Portugal) were subjects addressed by the films presented. In 2016, under the theme Roots, the festival spread for the first time to three different cities, Stockholm, V√§ster√•s and Gothenburg, starting on the 22 February, and having the last session on 6 March. This edition placed its focus on the concept of family through the exhibition of contemporary films, as well as documentaries produced in Portugal. What is family? and which are its invoked affects? Roots are not only a starting point but also what underpins an internal and external structure. Social Tales is the theme of the fourth edition of Frames - Portuguese Film Festival in 2017 . It will take place in Stockholm between 18 and 21 February, in V√§ster√•s and Gothenburg, similar to the 2016 edition. This theme will reveal cinema as a political gesture, through fiction and realistic depictions. Featured films will place focus on current social issues such as social organization, inequality and discrimination, which will serve as a stimulus for debate during the festival. This year, for the first time, the festival will include a Competitive Section with a prize awarded by a jury. This competition aims to bring an element of public participation and engagement to the festival. Any professional or amateur filmmaker can submit a short-film, as along as the producer/director is Portuguese or that the movie takes place in Portugal.

Exaltation is believed to be what God desires for all humankind. The church teaches that through exaltation believers may become joint-heirs with Jesus Christ as stated in Romans 8:12 and Revelation 21:7. The objective of adherents is to strive for purity and righteousness and to become one with Jesus as Jesus is one with God the Father.Joseph Smith, \\"King Follett Discourse\\". A verse in the canonized Doctrine and Covenants states that those who are exalted will become gods, and a 1925 statement from the church's highest governing body said that \\"All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother ... [and are] capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God.\\" A popular Mormon quote‚Äîoften attributed to the early apostle Lorenzo Snow in 1837‚Äîis \\"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.\\" Required ordinances According to LDS beliefs, certain ordinances are required of all those who hope to obtain exaltation. The ordinances that are required for exaltation are called \\"saving ordinances\\". The saving ordinances are *Baptism; *Confirmation; *Melchizedek priesthood ordination (for men); *Endowment, including washing and anointing; *Celestial marriage; *Sealing to parents. The endowment, celestial marriage, and sealing to parents take place in temples. Latter-day Saints are taught that they can receive exaltation through performing saving ordinances. Performance of the saving ordinances does not guarantee exaltation. Rather, individuals must do their best to be faithful to the covenants that the ordinances represent. For those who have lived and died without having received these ordinances, it is believed that exaltation will be available through LDS Church vicarious temple work. Latter-day Saints perform the saving ordinances on each other in temples on behalf of those who are dead. Latter- day Saints believe that all individuals will have an equitable and fair opportunity to hear the \\"fullness of the gospel\\" and that those who did not have an opportunity to accept the saving ordinances in this life will subsequently have the opportunity to accept them in the spirit world. Acceptance of the saving ordinances by those who have died is voluntary and does not take away the agency of those individuals. Should an individual who is in the spirit world subsequently reject saving ordinances performed for them, it would be as if these ordinances were never performed. It is taught that some will accept them, and others will reject them. There is currently a less common temple ordinance which confers exaltation called the second anointing. It is the pinnacle ordinance of the temple and an extension of the Nauvoo endowment which founder Joseph Smith taught was to ensure salvation, guarantee exaltation, and confer godhood. In the ordinance, a participant is anointed as a \\"priest and king\\" or a \\"priestess and queen\\", and is sealed to the highest degree of salvation available in Mormon theology. The ordinance is currently only given in secret to a few select couples chosen by top leaders, and presently most LDS adherents are unaware of the ritual's existence. Nature of exaltation The LDS Church teaches that those who receive exaltation will (1) live eternally in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ; (2) become gods; (3) be united eternally with their righteous family members and will be able to have eternal offspring; (4) receive a fulness of joy; and (5) be given everything that God the Father and Jesus Christ have‚Äîall power, glory, dominion, and knowledge.\\"Chapter 47: Exaltation\\", Gospel Principles, (Salt Lake City, UT: LDS Church, 2011). A 2020 manual for Sunday School teachers quotes Wendy Watson Nelson as stating that marital sex \\"will continue eternally\\".\\"Alma 39‚Äì42 'The Great Plan of Happiness'\\", Come, Follow Me‚ÄîFor Sunday School: Book of Mormon 2020 (Salt Lake City, UT: LDS Church, 2019). Different kingdoms Those who reject the ordinances are still believed to have the opportunity to inherit a kingdom of glory distinct from and of less glory than the celestial kingdom: the terrestrial kingdom or the telestial kingdomThe celestial kingdom is reserved for the members of the Church who have a testimony of Christ and live a Christian life. The terrestrial kingdom is for the honorable and virtuous people of the world as well as those who reject the gospel. The telestial kingdom is for the murderers, robbers, and liars. The celestial kingdom has two separate classes, those who are married and those who are not, who will be servants to others. (DC 130:5, 1 Corinthians. Gospel Topics ‚Äì Kingdoms of Glory, Official LDS Church Website Exaltation in the celestial kingdom is the ultimate goal of faithful LDS Church members. In an LDS scripture, the Book of Moses 1:39, God tells Moses that \\"this is my work and my glory‚Äîto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\\" God shows Moses a vision depicting some of His vast creations including a vast number of worlds created for other people, a sampling of what God created in the past and what he will continue to do forever. Each world was prepared and peopled by God for the purpose of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of His children. Immortality refers to personal resurrection by which each individual can continue to enjoy a perfect, physical body forever. Exaltation refers to living in the presence of God and Jesus Christ; to becoming like God both in terms of holiness or godliness and sharing in God's glory. It is commonly believed by members of the Church that as God's children, people may, through the merits and mercy accorded all through the Atonement of Christ, become like God the Father. As Paul taught the Romans, \\"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\\"Romans 8:17 Eternity will be spent in a process of eternal progression becoming more like the Father (God). Latter-day Saints posit that God has the power to exalt mortal man and even that without the possibility, there is little reason for mortality.The object of our earthly existence is that we may have a fullness of joy, and that we may become the sons and daughters of God, in the fullest sense of the word, being heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, to be kings and priests unto God, to inherit glory, dominion, exaltation, thrones and every power and attribute developed and possessed by our Heavenly Father. This is the object of our being on this earth. In order to attain unto this exalted position, it is necessary that we go through this mortal experience, or probation, by which we may prove ourselves worthy, through the aid of our elder brother Jesus ‚Äì \\"Melchizedek Priesthood Manual\\", Official LDS Church Website 9 June 2008.

In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands. The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(Œ∑6-toluene)2. The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand. The metal evaporates upon being heated resistively or irradiated with an electron beam. The apparatus operates under high vacuum.E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux \\"Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds\\" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley & Sons. In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures. In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes. Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of molybdenum(V) chloride in the presence of the diene.

It was engaged during the Battle of Britain and The Blitz, defending Royal Air Force airfields and the towns of southern England. Origin 76th was the first Territorial Army (TA) searchlight (S/L) regiment to be formed following the outbreak of war: the others existing at that time were converted pre-war Royal Engineers or infantry battalions, which were all transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) in August 1940. The regiment was officially formed on 20 May 1940 at 217th Searchlight Training Regiment (SLTR) at Bradbury Lines, Hereford. It was to comprise Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) and 474th‚Äì477th S/L Batteries. Of these, 474th (from cadres supplied by Edinburgh searchlight units) and 475th had already been formed under orders issued in February, while 476th and 477th were to be newly formed by 217th SLTR from cadres provided by 71st (East Lancashire) and 59th (Warwickshire) S/L Rgts respectively. The first Commanding Officer (CO) was Lieutenant-Colonel A.T. Colthart.76 S/L Rgt War Diary, 1940‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3096.474 S/L Bty War Diary, 1940‚Äì41,TNA file WO 166/3322.Farndale, Annex M.76 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. However, these plans were immediately changed: the CO was posted away within two weeks, and 476th and 477th S/L Btys were disbanded in June and July, the personnel of 477th being posted to help reform 1st S/L Rgt after its return from Dunkirk. Two new batteries were formed: 492nd S/L Bty from 217th SLTR, and 493rd S/L Bty from 222nd SLTR at Yeovil. Then in August 475 S/L Bty was exchanged with 485 S/L Bty from the reforming 2nd S/L Rgt, giving 76th S/L Rgt the following composition from 24 July:Frederick, pp. 860‚Äì1, 873. * RHQ * 474th S/L Bty * 485th S/L Bty * 492nd S/L Bty * 493rd S/L Bty Of these, 474th S/L Bty had already seen service defending Southampton in the early stages of the Battle of Britain. The new CO was Major P.J. Slater, DFC, TD, transferred from 59th S/L Rgt and promoted to Lt-Col, and the regiment came under the orders of 55th AA Brigade, covering the ports of Plymouth, Devon and Falmouth, Cornwall in 5th AA Division. By the end of August the regiment's lights were deployed across Dorset, South Wiltshire and South Somerset, with RHQ at Pythouse, Tisbury, Wiltshire.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376. The Blitz Pythouse, West Tisbury: 76th S/L Regimental HQ 1940‚Äì41 During the autumn, as the night-bombing 'Blitz' against British cities got under way, there was some movement among the regiment's detachments. While 474th and 485th Btys deployed at the standard 3000-yard intervals, 493rd Bty was in four six-light clusters and 485th was in three-light clusters. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with searchlight control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply. 485th and 493rd Btys received their first Gun-Laying Radar Mk I sets in December and became operational at the end of the year. The regiment was fully deployed in three-light clusters by mid-JanuaryRoutledge, p. 393.Sainsbury, p. 137. In November 1940 76th S/L Rgt came under 64th AA Bde in 8th AA Division, both being new formations created in the rapidly-expanding Anti-Aircraft Command. The brigade's prime responsibility was airfield defence in South West England.Farndale, AnnexD.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.8 AA Division at British Military History.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. In January 1941 474th Battery moved to Alderbury in Wiltshire, but its role was unchanged. It began to receive improved GL Mark I E/F gun-laying radar equipped with elevation-finding equipment. It was also engaged in experiments at RAF Boscombe Down to see how searchlights combined with AA guns could deal with low-flying attacks. By the spring the battery manned clusters of three searchlights at Boscombe Down and RAF Middle Wallop. Meanwhile, 485th and 493rd Btys were engaged in large-scale trials for AA Command and RAF Fighter Command.Routledge, p. 98. Mid-war 150 cm S/L with AA Radar No 2 After the Blitz ended in May 1941, the regiment continued its home defence role in AA Command. In September it began to receive its first purpose-built SLC radar (AA Radar No 2) in sufficient numbers to allow the sites to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 6000-yard intervals in a 'Killer Belt' cooperating with night-fighters.Routledge, pp. 99 & 399.Sainsbury, p. 140. In November 1941, the regiment was relieved by 2nd S/L Rgt and redeployed to Devon, with RHQ at Bolham, Devon, to take over sites from 88th and 89th S/L Rgts. For example, 485th Bty was deployed from Taunton to Axminster, with eight sites in the 'Indicator Belt' along the coast and 16 SLC sites in the Killer Belt. On 28 November one of its sites was bombed (with no casualties or damage) when it illuminated a hostile aircraft. By May 1942 the regiment had transferred to 60th AA Bde, and then before October 1942 to 69th AA Bde, both in 8th AA Division in SW England.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. At the end of September 1942 the AA Divisions were disbanded, being replaced by new AA Groups more closely aligned with the Groups of Fighter Command. 76th Searchlight Regiment remained in 69th AA Bde, now part of 3 AA Group, coinciding with No. 10 Group RAF covering SW England and South Wales.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.

The run-down began in the autumn: RHQ of 76th S/L Rgt with 485, 492 and 493 S/L Btys commenced disbandment at Woolacombe, North Devon, on 23 September 1944, completing the process on 3 March 1945. 474 (Independent) S/L Bty disbanded on 15 November 1945.

Early life Richardson was born on September 30, 1886 in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to John and Louisa Storrow (Cabot) Richardson. He attended Noble and Greenough School, Harvard College (A.B. 1908), and Harvard Law School (LL.B. 1911). While at Harvard, Richardson was captain of the Harvard crew and was elected to the Harvard Varsity Club's Hall of Fame. On September 7, 1909, Richardson married Hope Hemenway, the daughter of Augustus and Harriet Hemenway. They had five children, including John Richardson, Jr., who was United States Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs from 1969 to 1977. Legal career From 1911 until his retirement 1970s, Richardson worked for the Boston law firm of Ropes & Gray. For most of that time he specialized in corporate and trustee work and was also responsible for hiring young lawyers to join the firm. Military service Richardson served in the United States Army during World War I, rising from the rank to private to captain. He also worked in the United States Food Administration under the direction of Herbert Hoover. Politics Richardson worked for Herbert Hoover's nomination for President of the United States at the 1920, 1924, and 1928 Republican National Conventions. When White House Press Secretary George E. Akerson resigned in 1931, Richardson was considered a likely successor for the position, however he chose to work for Hoover's reelection campaign instead. On June 13, 1932, Richardson was elected to the Republican National Committee over former United States Senator and Republican National Committee Chairman William M. Butler by a vote of 18 to 15. Richardson's support came from by the younger members of the party, led by President of the Massachusetts Senate Gaspar G. Bacon, Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Leverett Saltonstall, Carl A. Terry, and Christian Herter. At the 1932 Republican National Convention, Richardson and the Massachusetts delegation supported Alvan T. Fuller for Vice President. Vice President Charles Curtis was renominated. In 1933, the Massachusetts Republican Party became split over the position of chairman of the Republican State Committee. Richardson supported Carl A. Terry, who defeated Charles Hiller Innes. The following year, Richardson supported George G. Tarbell to succeed Terry as chairman. In 1936, Richardson chose not to run for reelection and Congressman Joseph W. Martin was elected unopposed to succeed him as the Massachusetts member of the Republican National Committee. Other work and death From 1926 to 1968, Richardson served as president of the Boston Better Business Bureau. He also served as moderator of the Canton town meeting for over 40 years and was chairman of the board of trustees of the Noble and Greenough School.

It protects a mountainous area of cerrado forest and contains slopes that are used for paragliding. The park contains the geodetic center of Brazil. Location The Serra Azul State Park is in the municipality of Barra do Gar√ßas in the east of Mato Grosso. It has an area of . The park contains a landmark for the geodetic center of Brazil. The park is in the Guimar√£es plateau, bounded to the north by the Paranatinga depression, to the east by the Araguaia depression and to the northeast by the Parecis plateau. Altitudes range from at the park entrance to at the highest points. The terrain is rugged, including flatter areas and steep escarpments with slopes of more than 45¬∫. The park is on the bank of the Araguaia River, and is in the Araguaia- Tocantins basin. The mountains give rise to many streams that feed the Araguaia River or the Rio das Mortes. History The Serra Azul State Park was created by state law 6.539 of 31 May 1994. It is administered by the Secretary of State for the Environment (Sema). On 10 August 2015 governor Pedro Taques signed an agreement with the municipality of Barra do Gar√ßas for investment in the park's infrastructure and improved staffing. A fire burned 80% of the vegetation in August‚ÄìSeptember 2014 and the park was closed. It reopened for paragliding by members of the Free Flying Association in December 2015. Schools and universities were also allowed monitored access to the park subject to advanced authorization. SEMA said in 2015 they planned to gradually open new areas for visitors, who average 2,500 per month, to allow better security and conservation of local biodiversity. Environment Soils are mainly litholic, from sandstone formations, but flat areas have yellow latosol. The K√∂ppen climate classification is Aw, with two well-defined seasons. The dry season is from April to September, and the rainy season from October to March. Fires sometimes break out in the dry season. There were fires in 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. The fire in 2007 affected 80% of the park. There are small roads around some areas, remains of old farm roads from before the land was expropriated, which serve as firebreaks. The park is in the cerrado biome. Vegetation includes gallery forests, semi-deciduous forests, typical cerrado and rocky cerrado. About 800 species of vascular plants have been identified, and 180 species of birds, but the flora and fauna had not been subject to thorough inventories as of 2015. The Astyanax xavante is a fish that is endemic to the C√≥rrego Avoadeira, the largest stream in the park. The Boror√≥ people, who used to live in the area, called the park Kieguereiral (\\"Place of Birds\\") due to the great diversity of birds. Activities The park is an excellent location for paragliding. Other attractions include Christ's staircase, the gazebo and trails that lead to 15 waterfalls with an average height of . The Pezinhos Cave contains prehistoric paintings of great anthropological value. The cave was deteriorating due to people touching the paintings and writing on the walls. As of 2015 the cave was closed to visitors until a method of sustainable visitation could be arranged.

A gender-reveal party is an event or celebration had during pregnancy. The primary goal of this event is the eponymous \\"reveal\\" of the baby's expected gender based on the sex expected to be assigned at birth to the expecting parents, family, and friends. Twentieth century medical advancement in early, reliable prenatal sex discernment has allowed the requisite information that underlies these events to develop. Originating in the United States in the late 2000s, gender reveal parties are common only in the English-speaking world. It is distinct from, but sometimes combined with, a baby shower, whose primary activity is gifting expecting parents with important supplies and items for their future infant's care and well-being. A large variety of methods are utilized, often involving gender stereotypes such as pink and blue. The practice is controversial and has been criticized by some for reinforcing gender stereotypes. The implied binary gender essentialism of the practice has resulted in LGBT+ community criticisms, particularly from the transgender and intersex communities.  History and development  A modern creation, the gender reveal party's modern incarnation began in the late 2000s. One of the earliest notable examples was found in the 2008 posts of then-pregnant Jenna Karvunidis on her ChicagoNow blog High Gloss and Sauce announcing the sex of her fetus via cake. YouTube videos of the practice can be found as early as 2008 and 2009, becoming socially significant around 2011, after which the trend continued to grow through the 2010s. In 2019, Karvunidis later expressed regret at having helped start the gender reveal party trend, seeing how far some had taken the trend , learning how the LGBT and intersex communities feel, and finally revealing the daughter they announced back in 2008 to be a gender-nonconforming individual who wears suits while still identifying as female. = Comparison to baby showers = Baby showers, a traditional prenatal celebration, have some key differences with gender-reveal parties. Primarily, the focus on gender-reveal parties is fetal sex, while baby showers focus on the gifting of supplies and items for the future infant to the expectant parent(s). Traditionally, baby showers are for women only, while gender-reveal parties have no inherently-associated gender restriction and attendee limitations (if any) are determined by the pregnant individual or couple. Some couples choose to integrate both events into one for simplicity, efficiency, or economic reasons. = Spread and mediatization = The spread of the gender-reveal party trend can be attributed to social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest, despite the trend originating before the latter two existed. This mediatization has significantly boosted the likelihood of expectant parent(s) to have or take part in gender-reveal parties. Internet remix culture lends the practice great receptivity toward individual creativity, a factor in their growing popularity. Demographic research shows the most gender-reveal parties are done by expecting parents that are middle-class, heterosexual White Americans who are married or partnered.  Planning the event  The focus of gender-reveal parties being the fetal sex, such information is a prerequisite. This can be determined at or after the gestational age required by the method being used. For ultrasound, the most common method, the earliest this can be reliably done is approximately 65 days, however is typically done at around 20 weeks. Both the fetal sex and party are typically held during the second trimester. Post- examination knowledge of the fetal sex by the parents varies. Most commonly, a third party (sometimes called a \\"gender guardian\\") is entrusted with the fetal sex and it remains a secret from the parents until the reveal. This person is responsible for making party arrangements to ensure the reveal happens without the prior knowledge of the parents. However sometimes, it is known by the parents prior and the reveal to specifically for attendees. To help maintain the mystery, party decorations are typically heavily-gendered, but ambiguous and androgynous when taken as a whole.American football-themed gender-reveal party featuring \\"Team Pink\\" vs \\"Team Blue\\".  During the event  While the focus remains on the fetal sex, the reveal is typically the climax of the party. Prior to the reveal, party games are common where attendees or expecting parent(s) guess or assert the fetal sex. This can also take the form of competition between a \\"Team Pink\\" and \\"Team Blue\\" of which parent(s) or participants may form. Sometimes the event includes features of a baby shower. If this is the case, gifts may be given or opened at a specific time before or after the reveal.200x200px = The Reveal = Most reveal methods utilize gender-associated colors, most typically blue and pink representing male and female respectively, decorated with other gender-associated items. The method of reveal varies, however common methods involve cutting special cakes, launching or popping balloons, confetti/streamers, pi√±atas, colored smoke, and Silly String. Other seasonally-related items such as Easter eggs, Jack-o'-lanterns, Christmas presents, or Fourth of July or New Year's fireworks may also be incorporated depending on time of pregnancy. Once these colors are revealed, both the expecting parent(s) and onlookers are made aware of the fetus's sex, typically to great celebration and comment by attendees. The announcement of a predetermined, sex-dependent baby name can also take place.  Criticism  The sex and gender distinction underlies many criticisms of gender-reveal parties. The term \\"gender-reveal\\" is considered a misnomer by those who acknowledge the distinction. Gender is a social construct in this view, not attached to any biological characteristics, with an individual gender identity impossible to determine medically. Thus, when a reveal of a fetus's genitals is made, it is the sex and not the gender, that is being revealed according to this view. Furthermore, gender-reveal parties rely heavily on the male-female gender binary, which assumes the child will not be biologically intersex, which occurs in an estimated 1 in 4500‚Äì5500 births. Gender-reveal parties reinforce sex and gender assignment and gender essentialism, precluding and minimizing transgender identification, which can cause issues with mental and emotional health. Some parents have rejected gender-reveal events because of a greater awareness of gender identity. Overall the practice heavily reinforces stereotypical gender roles, often utilizing polarizing gender dichotomies in party materials such as \\"Guns or Glitter\\", \\"Pistols or Pearls\\", or \\"Wheels or Heels\\". Critics say that there is no reason to assume that a child would fit neatly into the essentialist dichotomy even where the sex is accurately determined and assigned gender remain the same. = Individual criticisms = In 2019, Jenna Karvunidis, considered one of the pioneers of gender reveal parties, called for re- evaluation of the practice due to how it might affect transgender and non- binary individuals, also revealing her own daughter's gender nonconformity. After the El Dorado Fire, Karvunidis decried the parties and pleaded for people to stop having them. In September 2020, writer Allison Hope, a gender- nonconforming individual, wrote in the wake of the El Dorado Fire that the \\"practice [of gender reveal parties] is pointless at best and dangerous at worst\\", adding it's harmful to transgender, non-binary, and intersex individuals.  Incidents and injuries  Some instances of attempted gender- reveals have caused injury, death, and even large-scale damage. The 2017 Sawmill Fire in Arizona was caused by a gender-reveal party that combined blue powder and an explosive. Other dangerous stunts have involved fireworks and alligators. \\"Gender reveal burnouts\\", in which cars emit billowing clouds of pink or blue smoke, are a fad that became popular in Australia around 2018. The Queensland Police Service warns that this practice is dangerous, and that there have been a number of attempted \\"burnouts\\" that resulted in flaming vehicles and arrests. In October 2019, an Iowa woman was killed by debris from the explosion of a homemade device meant to reveal her relative's gender. In September 2020, a gender-reveal pyrotechnic device started the El Dorado Fire near Yucaipa, California, destroying homes, prompting evacuations, burning thousands of acres, and causing at least one death of a firefighter.

Campaign During the Swedish invasion of the Danish province of Blekinge, the soldiers in the far back of the marching Swedish army were taken captive by the locals and hanged from the trees in the country side. In retaliation, King Eric XIV of Sweden gave the order that all lands between Lyckeby and Ronneby were free to pillage, killing and burning by the army. On 3 September 1564, the Swedish army reached the Danish city of Ronneby, which was at that point a flourishing and wealthy merchant city. The city lacked proper defense fortifications or a garrison, but likely expected to be given assistance from the Danish troops, which were positioned some miles away. The city refused to surrender to the Swedes despite been given two opportunities to do so. When the Swedish army stormed the city early on the morning of 4 September, they quickly pulled down the temporary palisade which was its only defense and, with no soldiers defending it, pillaged the city and massacred its inhabitants in accordance with the order of scorched earth issued by Eric XIV. Eric XIV wrote of the storming of the city: \\"The water in the Ronneby [river] was red by the blood from dead bodies. And were the enemies so meek, that one did not bother much with them, but cut them down as a horde of wild boars, and spared no one but killed all that was there, so that in the city there were more than two thousand men killed by their throats aside for some women and children, whom the miserable Finns beat to death\\".Albert Vejde: \\"Erik XIV och √∂del√§ggelsen av Ronneby 1564\\" (Scandia, bind 2 (1929), nr 1; s. 54-64) A great fortune was taken as war price including silver and gold, household goods, wine and salt and many more goods stored by the city merchants, and much of the city was burned down during the pillage. Aftermath When the pillage was over, Eric XIV gave the order that the surviving inhabitants were to be gathered and resettled in Sweden proper. This has been interpreted that he intended to keep the province of Blekinge, and populate it with loyal Swedish and Finnish colonists. This plan, however, was never put in action because of the swift change of the war situation shortly after. Whether Eric XIV was actually present in Ronneby during the bloodbath is unknown; the day after, he is known to have been in Lyck√•, and the day after that, he was already on his way back to Kalmar. The Ronneby Bloodbath was frequently used as propaganda by both Sweden and Denmark during the war: the Swedes to demonstrate a well deserved victory by Eric XIV, and the Danes to gather more resistance toward the Swedes among by pointing to the cruelty during the Ronneby Bloodbath. In practice, the bloodbath in Ronneby was not unusual in accordance with contemporary war custom, where a city taken by storm was left to be pillaged by the conquerors. Many leading citizens of the city are known to have survived, among them its mayor, Birger Jonsson. References Further reading * Larsson, Lars-Olof (2005). Arvet efter Gustav Vasa.

It was built in 1941 by Oskar Vierling as a laboratory for researching High Frequency technology and electroacoustics and was used until 1945 by 250 employees for research into weapons and communication technology as part of the German armaments programme during the Second World War. At the end of the war the castle was seized by American soldiers, from 1946 it was rented by the Archdiocese of Bamberg under Jupp Schneider and sold in 1949. Since then the castle and the entire estate have been in use as a Roman Catholic youth and conference centre.  History  Oskar Vierling was looking for a central location for his laboratories. The choice fell on a hill called the Feuerstein. Its design as a castle blended well into the countryside of Franconian Switzerland and was chosen for camouflage reasons. During the war it was disguised as a hospital and had tiles in the form of a red cross on the roof, but actually housed a laboratory for secret Nazi armament projects. After the end of the war it was abandoned and construction plans and documents were destroyed. Nevertheless, in 2011 a document came into the hands of cryptographer-historian, Norbert Ryska, from the American special unit, Ticom (Target Intelligence Committee), which described the work of Vierling at Feuerstein Castle in more detail. According to this, Vierling worked for the Nazis on speech encoding methods, acoustic torpedo control, acoustic detonation of mines, anti-detection technology for U boats and in the fields of radio and electrotechnology.Nazi-Labor in Oberfranken: Geheimwaffen aus dem Burgverlies. einestages. Zeitgeschichten auf Spiegel Online. Retrieved 22 April 2011. A relict of its construction period is the present wine cellar, formally a walk-in safe with a ten-centimetre- thick steel door. The charm of the castle comes not from any medieval origin, but from its wartime history and its young age. The castle has been expanded by dormitory accommodation, a dining hall, leisure facilities (Kegelbahn, table tennis, volleyball, hard court, sports field), conference rooms, camping sites, agriculture, a riding stable and a glider airfield. Today Feuerstein Castle is a modern youth facility owned by the Diocese of Bamberg. In 1999 Feuerstein Observatory was founded, 500 metres south of Feuerstein Castle Airfield. The observatory took the name of the castle. The tower of the castle is used by the observatory as a microwave radio relay relay station to link it to the town of Ebermannstadt in the valley. In this way the tower built by Vierling to test the first radio relay link continues to fulfil its original purpose.  The churches  In 1961 the Church of the Transfiguration of Jesus was opened. It consists of three spaces: the crypt, the lower church and the upper church. The crypt is accessed by steps from the lower church and only dimly lit. It houses the eternal flame and the tabernacle. On the sides of the tabernacle are twelve candlesticks which represent the twelve apostles. The lower church is dedicated to Mary, the \\"Mother of Wisdom\\". It has an altar, behind which is a mural portraying the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The glass windows are kept dark and portray on one side the head of a beast of prey, fire, broken ears of corn and the reaper, and on the other side, people, a rainbox, the sun and angels' wings. Both the mural and the window are works by the artist, Alfred Heller, from Bamberg. After leaving the lower church, the path runs past windows that portray the fundamental attitudes of Christian spirituality: Oratio ‚Äì Meditatio ‚Äì Contemplatio (\\"prayer - meditation - contemplation\\"). The upper church was designed by the architect Heinzmann and cathedral master builder Sch√§del. It was consecrated in 1961 and constructionally anticipated the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council a year later: the altar is positioned in the nave so that the priest can celebrate mass with the congregation.Siehe die Instruktion zur ordnungsm√§√üen Durchf√ºhrung der Konstitution √ºber die heilige Liturgie \\"Inter oecumenici\\", 26 September 1964, No. 91.

After gaining trading experience in Loviisa, Dahlstr√∂m moved to Turku to work for Abraham Kingelin's trading house. He started his own trading house two years after and focused on retail in Baltic Sea area. Dahlstr√∂m's trading house grew substantially after taking over Kingelin's businesses. Dahlstr√∂m invested on steam shipping and became one of the most significant shipowners of the city. Since the 1850s Dahlstr√∂m invested increasingly on domestic industry. He was founding owner of Aura Sugar Mill, Turku Engineering Works, Kymi Paper Mill and Akaa Steam Sawmill. Dahlstr√∂m took part in the local politics and represented Turku bourgeoisie in Diet of Finland 1863‚Äì1864. Dahlstr√∂m's sone Ernst and Magnus continued their father's businesses and became notable philanthropists in Turku.  Early years  Dahlstr√∂m was born in Loviisa, Uusimaa Province. His parents were Swedish-born gardener Abraham Dahlstr√∂m and Anna Sofia n√©e Tollet. Father died when Carl Magnus was just 12 years old.  Career  = Merchant career = Dahlstr√∂m's first workplace was at local merchant Nordman, and in 1832 he moved to Turku to work as bookkeeper for Abraham Kingelin's trading house. In 1836 he received bourgeoisie rights and founded a retail company together with Carl Gustaf Eschner, who also was originally from Loviisa. In 1842 Dahlstr√∂m became sole owner. He developed business with help of his former employer, Abraham Kingelin, and created a wide network of business partners in Saint Petersburg, Stockholm, Hamburg and L√ºbeck. He travelled almost yearly in Germany, Sweden and France. In 1844 Dahlstr√∂m married Kingelin's daughter Sofia Karolina. When Kingelin's trading house later fell into trouble, Dahlstr√∂m took it over in 1859. The main export articles were timber, butter, iron and pine tar; in the way back Dahlstr√∂m imported coffee, grain, sugar and alcoholic beverages. = Shipping = As Dahlstr√∂m's businesses relied on sea transport, he invested on shipping. The local pioneer in steam shipping, √Öbo √•ngfartygsbolag (\\"Turku Steam Shipping Company\\"), bankrupted in 1849, after which the company was re-established under name √Öbo nya √•ngfartygsbolag (\\"Turku New Steam Shipping Company\\"), in which Dahlstr√∂m was a shareholder. In 1856 he founded Aura √Öngfartygsbolag, which operated new steamship Aura; the ship travelled from Turku to Stockholm in 14 hours. The company was merged to the New Steamship Company in 1861. By the 1860s Dahlstr√∂m was one of the most significant shipowners of Turku. = Aura Sugar Refinery = Aura Sugar Refinery at river Aura in Turku. The new economic policy following to the Crimean War and economic upswing advanced the development of Finland. Therefore, Dahlstr√∂m decided to invest on domestic production. He saw potential in sugar production, as the oldest sugar refinery of Finland, located in Turku, had been closed down already in 1824 and more than 90% of sugar in the Finnish market was imported. A new technology developed abroad made it possible to produce sugar competitively in Finland. A consortium of Turku merchants, including Dahlstr√∂m, Fr. Spoof, Gustaf Adolf Lindblom, E. P. Thom√© and Abraham Kingelin Jr. founded Aura Sockerbruk, (\\"Aura Sugar Refinery\\"). A modern factory building was built in 1856‚Äì1859. Dahlstr√∂m was the first manager of the company, and under his leadership, the operations were profitable since the beginning, and the company became a strong competitor against the other domestic producer, T√∂√∂l√∂ Sugar Refinery. = Engineering = Dahlstr√∂m could see the potential of steam-engine powered seafaring and invested on engineering operations. He was a shareholder in the 1874-started √Öbo mekaniska verkstads (\\"Turku Engineering Works\\"), founded by Carl Korsman. At the beginning the main focus was on shipbuilding, but later the company specialised on machinery. = Forest industry = Dahlstr√∂m saw potential in the Finnish sawmilling and paper industry. He was founding owner of 1872 started Kymi Paper Mill located in Kuusankoski; he owned six of total 20 shares of the company, being the largest shareholder. Dahlstr√∂m's son Ernst Dahlstr√∂m was the first manager of the company. Dahlstr√∂m was the main shareholder also in Viiala-located 1873 founded Akkas √Öngs√•g Ab (\\"Akaa Steam Sawmill Ltd\\"), which was a joint project between Turku and Tampere businessmen. = Other businesses = Dahlstr√∂m was co-founder of Turku Gasworks in 1861; the company built street lighting to the city. Large part of Dahlstr√∂m's industrial property had come through his marriage. He owned shares from Littoinen Baize Factory and Kingelin & Co. brewery. Managing of industrial operations took eventually so much of Dahlstr√∂m's time that he gave up retail business in 1870. = Political career = Since the 1840s Dahlstr√∂m took part in positions of trust. He was selected to follow his father-in-law in the board of city elders. Dahlstr√∂m took part in boards of schools and other institutions. He represented the bourgeoisie of Turku in Diet of Finland in 1863‚Äì1864; as a member of treasury committee, he promoted renewal of economic legislation and building a railway connection between Turku and Helsinki.  Private life  Dahlstr√∂m married Sofia Karolina n√©e Kingelin in 1844. The couple got two daughters and five sons in 1844‚Äì1859; three sons survived until adult age. 1846 born Ernst and 1859-born Magnus continued their father's businesses and became notable philanthropists in Turku.

The Bucky diaphragm and the subsequent Bucky-Potter grid, devices that prevent scattered X-ray particles from reaching the X-ray film, are named for him. Bucky spent significant portions of his career in both Germany and the United States. He was close friends with Albert Einstein and shared a patent with him for a self-adjusting camera. Early life and career Grenz waves (low energy radiation waves) in 1925. Bucky was born in Leipzig. He wanted to become an engineer, but his parents steered him toward medical school. He studied medicine in Geneva and Leipzig, graduating from medical school in 1906 after completing a thesis on the mechanisms of the movement of paratyphus from lymph and blood vessels to the gastrointestinal tract. Since the mid-1890s, physicians had been struggling with a factor that limited the usefulness of X-rays: When X-ray particles hit part of a patient's body, secondary particles were released, scattered and hit the X-ray field, contributing to blurry X-ray images. In 1913, Bucky invented a system of two plates with grids on them. One plate was placed between the X-ray beam and the patient, and the other was placed between the patient and the film. The grids ensured that the secondary particles stayed in columns rather than scattering across the X-ray field. The Bucky diaphragm reduced the blur of X-ray images, but it caused grid lines to appear on the films. Bucky made a presentation to the German Roentgen Society about his new invention and he secured patents in both the U.S. and Germany. Bucky came to the U.S. in 1923, and he was the seventh physician granted an honorary New York state medical license without being required to take the licensure examination. However, after World War I, forfeiture laws affected citizens of the Central Powers and caused Bucky to lose the rights to his patent, so he missed out on any earnings that he could have received for his invention of the Bucky diaphragm. An American radiologist, Hollis E. Potter, modified the grids from Bucky's invention, making them movable so that the lines did not show up on the X-ray image. Later career In 1929, Bucky took a position in Germany as the radiology department head at Rudolf Virchow Hospital. Returning to the U.S. in 1933 for political reasons, he became close friends with Albert Einstein in the course of providing medical treatment to Einstein's wife Elsa. Einstein had also moved from Germany to the U.S. not long before that. Bucky tried to recoup some of his financial losses by patenting modifications of existing imaging technologies. He was often sued for patent infringement, and the normally private Einstein used his patent expertise to help Bucky out of these situations. In 1935, Bucky and Einstein jointly filed a patent application for a camera that self-adjusted the amount of light that was let into the photographic plate. A few years later, Kodak introduced an automatic camera called the Super Six-20, but the two cameras operate on different principles. Bucky and Einstein remained very close, and Bucky was present when Einstein was on his deathbed. Personal life Bucky died in 1963 and he was survived by his wife Frida and two children. In 1967, Bucky's widow decided to auction off a collection of letters from Einstein to Gustav Bucky. One of Bucky's children, Peter A. Bucky, was preparing to write a memoir about the family's relationship with Einstein and he tried to buy the letters, but the collection sold for more than $35,000 and he was outbid. Peter A. Bucky later published his memoir, titled The Private Albert Einstein. Frida Bucky, who had written several children's songs, lived until 1974, when she was 91 years old.

In 2009 she became the first woman to win the Journalistic Distinction in Caricature award. In 2014 El Adl was honoured by the Swiss foundation Cartooning for Peace. The award was presented by Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who said that the prize \\"recognises those who commit their voices and artistic talent to the cause of peace and tolerance and who use a universal language of images to inform and educate and celebrate our common humanity\\". In 2016 she was included in the BBC's 100 Women project. Work After the Egyptian revolution of 2011, her work became strongly critical of President Mohamed Morsi. el-Adl created controversy in December 2012 when Al-Masry Al-Youm published her cartoon depicting an angel informing Adam and Eve that they could have stayed in the Garden of Eden if they had voted for the right candidate. According to el-Adl, the cartoon was intended as a criticism of \\"politicians taking advantage of religion and using it to dominate and influence simple people\\", but led to her being accused of blasphemy by Khaled El Masry, a Salafi lawyer and then Secretary General of the Salafist Front's National Centre for Defending Freedoms. The suit claimed that the cartoon insulted the role of Adam in Islam. An investigation was ordered by Attorney General Talaat Abdallah; this was dropped after the 2013 Egyptian coup d'etat. The same year, she was questioned by prosecutor general Talaat Abdallah for a cartoon in which she criticized Islamists in Egypt and their influence in politics. She was defended by Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff, who depicted el-Adl defending herself against an Islamist with a spear-like pencil. In February 2013, el-Adl created a cartoon to criticise female genital mutilation, by illustrating a seedy-looking man climbing a ladder and stretching, holding a pair of scissors, to cut off a red flower between a woman's legs. Speaking to Clitoraid in 2013, El Adl explained, \\"Before the revolution took place, I was casually drawing about women's issues and their problems, but now I am compelled to draw these cartoons about women in order to defend my own existence, my personal freedom that are threatened under the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" Her cartoons depicting the trial of President Hosni Mubarak were also popular.

She is the president of the Movimiento Migrante Mesoamericano (MMM), a movement initiated in 2006, which aims to help mothers of disappeared migrants to find their lost ones, by travelling via caravan for several days along routes they usually make during the illegal trip to the United States. In 2016, she was one of the 9 inspiring and influential Latin American women named in the BBC 100 Women list. Early life S√°nchez Soler was born in France in 1941 to refugees fleeing Francoist Spain. She was raised in Mexico and then completed her university studies in the United States, majoring in social science at San Diego State University of California. Her second husband, Jos√© Jacques y Medina, was a student activist, who fled to the United States to avoid an arrest for protest during the Mexican Student Movement of 1968. Career In the early part of her career, S√°nchez worked as a teacher in marginalized area of Southern California. Then she spent many years working with impoverished populations. Through the 1990s S√°nchez worked in education and defending the human rights of marginalized people. She was responsible for implementing the Memorando de Entendimiento sobre Educaci√≥n de Adultos (Memorandum of Understanding on Adult Education) in Baja California, which was signed by the Presidents of Mexico and the United States. She developed regional educational materials in Baja California to improve the quality of education delivered to migrant students. As a teacher, she helped improve the education of populations considered geographically dispersed and marginalized in Baja California. In 2005, S√°nchez helped establish the Caravan of Central American mothers, in which mothers search for their children who may have been arrested, kidnapped, or disappeared on their journey through Mexico to the U.S. Each year, since founding the group, mothers from throughout Central American countries, gather and search along migration routes for family members who have gone missing. To raise awareness of the issue, S√°nchez participates in conferences, like the 2nd Mesoamerican Meeting of Human Rights Defenders () held in El Salvador in 2013. In 2006, S√°nchez and her husband, founded the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, to better facilitate the caravans and press for government action to protect migrants. Together with the movement, S√°nchez Soler operates a caravan containing Central American mothers from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, who travel each year to find their children and raise awareness about the risks faced by migrants. Traveling the length of Mexico, but focusing on the southeastern border where most migrants enter the country, S√°nchez has led groups for over a decade resulting in locating more than 250 Central Americans among the missing. S√°nchez and three other activists, Pilar Arrese Alcala, Claudia Medina Tamariz and Brenda Rangel Ortiz attended the North American Leaders' Summit in mid-2016 to urge the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United States to deal with the problems of detention, disappearance and torture, which has plagued various states in Mexico during the last decade as fallout from the War on Drugs.

Football The GER Sports Ground is the Home of March Town United F.C. Greyhound Racing The ground started greyhound racing from 31 January 1931. The first winner was a greyhound called Theaker over a race distance of 600 yards (two laps of the 300 yard course) and then he contested a final later that day. In the 1960s alterations were made to the ground to accommodate changes in the greyhound track which upset the football followers due to the fact that the wooden stand was moved further from the pitch. Racing took place on Wednesday and Saturday evenings on a circumference of 450 yards. Race distances were 325, 550 and 760 yards, and it had an all grass circuit with an inside hare system.

It is located on the University of Notre Dame campus, and is owned by the University. The sculpture, made of bronze and limestone, depicts Father William Corby giving absolution to soldiers at the Battle of Gettysburg. Description Chaplain Corby of Gettysburg is an outdoor sculpture in front of Corby Hall on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. The sculpture depicts Father Corby giving general absolution to the soldiers of the Union Army's Irish Brigade on July 2, 1863. The sculpture is a replica of Samuel Murray's Father William Corby on Cemetery Ridge on the Gettysburg Battlefield. The bronze figure of Father Corby stands atop a limestone boulder brought to Notre Dame from the Gettysburg National Battlefield. The work was dedicated on May 30, 1911 as a part of a Notre Dame Decoration Day celebration. Historical Information Father William Corby (1910), by Samuel Murray, Gettysburg Battlefield. The statue stands atop the same boulder on which Father Corby stood while granting absolution to troops on the second day of the battle. =Father Corby at Gettysburg= During the Civil War, Father William Corby was chaplain of the 88th New York Infantry, one of the five original regiments in the Union Army's Irish Brigade. On July 2, 1863, the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, the Irish Brigade was preparing to enter battle when Father Corby stood on a boulder and began giving the soldiers general absolution. As Father Corby recounted in his memoir, Memoirs of Chaplain Life: \\"That general absolution was intended for all ‚Äì in quantum possum ‚Äì not only for our brigade, but for all, North or South, who were susceptible of it and who were about to appear before their Judge.\\" The scene of the absolution is represented in Paul Wood's 1891 painting, Absolution Under Fire, which is on display at Notre Dame's Snite Museum of Art. The painting helped shape historical understanding of the absolution as a dramatic, heroic, and sacred event. =Gettysburg Sculpture= General St. Clair Mulholland, president of the Gettysburg Memorial Commission and a member of the Irish Brigade, began the movement for the installation of a tribute to Corby at Gettysburg as early as the 1890s. He did not manage to raise much money through his initial efforts. In January 1909, The Catholic Alumni Sodality of Philadelphia proposed the creation of a monument to Father Corby on the Gettysburg National Battlefield. The archbishops of New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore also supported the proposal. They sought contributions from Notre Dame alumni and veterans of the battle to pay for the work, with the cost estimated at $7,000. These groups commissioned Samuel Murray, a sculptor from Philadelphia, to complete the project. After the death of Mulholland in February 1910, Henry A. Daily of the Catholic Sodality of Philadelphia took control of the project. Murray completed a first model of the project on March 3, 1910, but the committee denied the model, as Murray depicted Father Corby in military officer's attire, rather than chaplain's attire. The final sculpture, Father William Corby, was dedicated on October 29, 1910. On the 25th, 50th, 100th, and 150th anniversary of the absolution, priests from Notre Dame, including Father Theodore Hesburgh and Father John Jenkins, celebrated the Catholic Mass at Gettysburg. The Notre Dame Club of Gettysburg organized the 150th anniversary Mass at the statue. =Acquisition of Sculpture at Notre Dame= On March 10, 1911, the residents of Corby Hall submitted a proposal to the University administration to obtain a replica of Father William Corby in Gettysburg to \\"call attention to the historic merits of a great alumnus and official of the University.\\" The proposal stated that the residents would collect the necessary $1,500 from members of the student body. The residents of Corby Hall would also oversee the sculpture's installation and unveiling. University president Father John W. Cavanaugh, who attended the dedication of the sculpture in Gettysburg, endorsed the effort. The student newspaper, Notre Dame Scholastic published weekly fundraising updates with the names of each donor for the following three months. By June 1911, the Corby Monument Fund raised $848 with 132 donations from students, alumni, and others. The University funded the remaining sum. The University held a Decoration Day unveiling event on May 30, 1911 with addresses from General John C. Black, former Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic and Father John P. Chadwick. Artist The Catholic Alumni Sodality of Philadelphia chose Samuel Murray, a Roman Catholic and son of Irish immigrants, to sculpt the piece. Murray had been the student of Thomas Eakins and was one of the preeminent sculptors in Philadelphia at the time. Condition The area surrounding the sculpture is annually decorated with flowers and flags on July 2 to commemorate the anniversary of Father Corby's absolution. The sculpture is popularly known as \\"Fair Catch Corby.\\" See also * List of public art in St. Joseph County, Indiana * List of presidents of the University of Notre Dame * Samuel Murray References External links * Notre Dame Scholastic Archives * Gettysburg National Military Park * Snite Museum of Art * Chaplain Corby of Gettysburg Image 1911 sculptures Outdoor sculptures in Notre Dame University of Notre Dame Public Art Collection ","title":"Chaplain Corby of Gettysburg"},{"id":"52556496","text":"Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are abnormal differences seen in neuroimaging of Alzheimer's Disease patients, associated with amyloid- modifying therapies, particularly human monoclonal antibodies such as aducanumab. There are two types of ARIA - ARIA-E and ARIA-H. The phenomenon was first seen in trials of bapineuzumab.  ARIA-E  ARIA-E refers to cerebral edema, involving the breakdown of the tight endothelial junctions of the blood-brain barrier and subsequent accumulation of fluid. In a double- blind trial of the humanised monoclonal antibody solanezumab (n = 2042), sixteen patients (11 taking the drug, 5 taking a placebo), or 0.78% developed ARIA-E. A further 7 patients developed ARIA-E during an open-label extension of the trial. The effect of ARIA-E depends on the severity and location of the oedema. Symptoms may include headache, changes in mental state, confusion, vomiting, nausea, tremor and gait disturbances.  ARIA-H  ARIA-H refers to cerebral microhaemorrhages (mH), small haemorrhages on the brain, often accompanied by hemosiderosis. mH is usually seen as small, round and low intensity lesions and are small haemosiderin deposits. Some studies define mH as being less than or equal to 10mm, while others define the cut-off as ‚â§ 5mm.

He lives and works in the historic Whitley Heights district of Los Angeles, soaking in the abundant inspiration of his surroundings, and using his intricate works to trace a meaningful dialogue with humanity as a whole.  Early Years  Since childhood, Mudgett has always shown a strong interest in art. At the age of nine he visited the Barnes Collection in Dallas, where he had a first taste of what was possible in painting. His first meeting with the great masters like Van Gogh, C√©zanne and Picasso opened his eyes to the possibility of what art can do, not only for the human spirit, but also as a way of transforming abstract ideas into something that can to be universally shared and understood. However, his journey into the visual arts world does not begin until 2011, after 15 years of music career, when he felt he needed a more immediate and direct form of self-expression to satisfy his creative impulses.  Artistic Style  A stylistic descendant of the cubist movement, Mudgett adds a nostalgic, reflective fingerprint to the genre. Oftentimes, rendering his subjects with a single, continuous line, he uses the fluidity of shapes to explore the genuine na√Øvet√© of his subjects.  Exhibitions  Since 2012, Mudgett has exhibited his work in numerous galleries and art fairs across the country. Most recently LA Art Show & Art Basel Miami.

He was among the most important gods of the Luwians.  Name  The name was written in the Luwian cuneiform of the Bronze Age as , which can be read as *Runtiya or *Kruntiya. In Hieroglyphic Luwian of the Iron Age, he was named \\"Runtiya\\" and his name was generally written with the image of a deer or antlers, as (DEUS) CERVUS (\\"God deer\\"). The name is possibly derived from a word for \\"horn\\" or \\"antler\\", but all the etymologies which have been proposed to date are problmeatic. The relationship between Runtiya and the Kurunta is disputed. Some scholars argue that the two gods are identical and reconstruct an older Luwian form of the name, *Krunti(ya)-; others suggest that there was a pre-Indo-European Anatolian divinity which the Luwian Runtiya and the Hittite Kurunta had developed. Runtiya was often invoked in personal names: the oldest example derives the 18th century BC K√ºltepe, where a man called Ruwa(n)tia and another called Ru(n)tia are attested.Ilya Yakubovich: Sociolinguistics of the Luvian Language. Dissertation, Chicago 2008, pp. 269 f. (PDF; 2.2 MB). The latest attested names are Hellenistic examples from Cilicia: Rondas (Œ°œâŒΩŒ¥Œ±œÇ), Rozarmas (Œ°œâŒ∂Œ±œÅŒºŒ±œÇ; Luwian: *Runt-zalma- \\"Runtiya is safety\\") and Rondbies (Œ°œâŒΩŒ¥Œ≤ŒπŒ∑œÇ; Luwian: Runt(a)-piya- \\"Runtiya-Gift\\").Philo Hendrik Jan Houwink Ten Cate: The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera During the Hellenistic Period. E. J. Brill, Leiden 1961, pp. 128‚Äì131.  Role  During the Bronze Age, he was the treated as a protective deity, the son of the Sun god Tiwaz and the goddess Kamru≈°epa. His partner was \\"Lady Ala.\\" The pair were enovked along with various mountains and rivers, such as ·∏™UR.SAG≈†arpa ( near Emirgazi). Runtiya's epithet ≈°arlaimi (\\"raised\\") was also the name of a mountain god. In the Neo-Hittite period, Runtiya and Ala-Kubaba shared a sanctuary at Ancoz. = Meadow god = Runtiya was closely linked with the deer and his Iron Age epithets Imralli and Imrassi (\\"The meadow\\") indicate his connection to hunting. According to Iron Age evidence, he received sacrifices of gazelles and rewarded the worshipper for this with success in the hunt. Divinities are also known from the Bronze Age which were referred to with the Luwian word im(ma)ra- (\\"field, meadow\\") and are likely to be linked to this aspect of Runtiya. Thus, in the cult of the Hittite city of ·∏™ubi≈°na, the divinity was named immediately before dLAMMA ≈°arlaimi and in the cult of , dImmar≈°ia is listed immediately after the \\"Great Protective God\\" (dLAMMA GAL). Another relevant Luwian deity was . The Carian god Imbramos or Imbrasos (·ººŒºŒ≤œÅŒ±œÉŒøœÇ) which Stephanus of Byzantium identified with Hermes, probably belongs to this group of deities as well. In the Luwian-Phoenician Karatepe Bilingual Runtiya is identified with Resheph (r≈°p ·π£prm \\"Ra≈°ap of the he-goats\\" or \\"Ra≈°ap of the birds\\").Wolfgang Fauth: Gnomon. 46, 1974, pp. 689.  Depiction According to a Hittite description of a statuette of the Protective God, he was depicted as a man standing on a deer, with a bow in his right hand and eagle and hares in his left hand. Iron Age depictions of Runtiya, like the Karasu relief show him as a beardless god standing on a deer, with a peaked cap and a bow over his shoulder.  Subsequent history  It is generally agreed that Runtiya lived on in the cult of Hermes at Korykos in Rough Cilica, especially since the lists of priests of the sanctuary in the nearby grottos of Cennet and Cehennem frequently include Ro(nd)- as part of their personal names.Philo Hendrik Jan Houwink Ten Cate: The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera During the Hellenistic Period.

Early life 1919 - 1934 The second of two children, Joan Court was born on 13 April 1919 in Knightsbridge Square, London, England, where her father Cecil was a solicitor with the family firm. Joan's mother Muriel was the daughter of the mayor of St Albans, Henry Gibson. Joan's parents separated in 1922 when she was three years old, Muriel taking the two children to live at Parsonage Farm, Rickmansworth, where her parents lived. After a year at Parsonage Farm, Muriel moved to Baker Street, London and Peter was sent to boarding school. Muriel succumbed to alcoholism and Joan retreated from her mother's rages and found solace in her pet cats. In 1926 the family moved to 7 Stanley Villas in Marsh Lane, Pinner, not far from the railway station. In 1930 Cecil Court intervened and took Joan to a convent in Torquay. In the holidays Joan would return to Pinner. In the hot summer of 1932 Cecil Court committed suicide. Joan and her mother then entered domestic service in Cornwall to make ends meet, while Peter left for India to work for the Ceylon Tea Company. Cape Town 1934 - 1936 In 1934 the Society for Overseas Settlement of British Women offered Joan and her mother the opportunity to live in Cape Town, working in domestic service in a convent. During this time Joan took inspiration from Indian poets such as Rabindranath Tagore. She determined to become a writer and took up life modelling to pay for a typewriter. By 1936 the Mother Superior suggested to Joan that she become a nurse at St Thomas' in London, which she did, leaving her mother and girlfriend Jane behind in Cape Town. Nursing and midwifery 1936 - 1945 Joan returned to Parsonage Farm before taking up a position at St Monica's Home of Rest in Bristol, in order to prepare for the Entrance Examination of the General Nursing Council. After two years she passed the examination and entered St Thomas' Hospital as a trainee nurse. During the course of her time there she met the soul mate of her youth, Liz, and served as a nurse when WW2 broke out. Unfortunately Liz developed multiple sclerosis and died in May 1943. In January 1943 Joan had begun to train as a midwife at Willesden. India 1945 - 1948 On 14 October 1945 Joan sailed on the SS Strathnaver for India to work as a midwife in Calcutta for the Quakers. Her brother Peter met her when she arrived in Bombay and the next day she was on board the Calcutta Express train. Soon after arriving she was dispatched to areas of Bengal affected by a tidal wave and flooding. She met several of her heroes in India - in Bengal she nursed the daughter of Rabindranath Tagore and met Gandhi; and in Calcutta she heard E. M. Forster give a lecture on English Literature. At this time Joan also visited a number of Hindu and Buddhist sacred sites including the cave paintings in Ajunta. Once the crisis in Bengal was over Joan moved to the Midwifery and Child Welfare Centre on Sitaram Ghosh street in Calcutta. In this service she met one of her dearest life-long friends, fellow nurse Bela Bannerjee. Supported by the Quakers with medicine and vitamin supplies, Joan did what she could to help alleviate the problems of terrible poverty in Calcutta. When the Calcutta riots broke out on 16 August 1946 the streets became dangerous so requests for a midwife would pass to Joan by word of mouth over the rooftops. After a year the riots subsided but the trouble had spread to East Bengal. Joan went to help Gandhi who was fasting and walking from village to village to help restore peace. She would accompany him on walks, Joan walking in a ditch so he could rest his hand on her shoulder. On one occasion she led a gathering of villagers in singing Gandhi's favourite hymn, \\"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross\\". Joan met her first male lover Harry in India. Harry was an American working for another relief agency and although he was married they carried on a romantic love affair. At this time Joan was planning to study public health nursing in England but when she saw an advert for the Frontier Nursing Service in Kentucky (a horseback nursing service for rural communities), she jumped at the chance. The service was happy to take her after completing her health visitor course so on 15 August 1947, Indian Independence Day, she returned to England. Chelsea, London 1948 - 1949 Living in Chelsea while training as a health visitor, Joan completed the course in 1948, the year when the National Health Service came into being. After a year of service Joan continued with her plan to work in Kentucky as a rural health visitor. She left London in 1949, meeting with Harry in New York for a week before going on to Kentucky to take up her position. Kentucky, USA 1949 - 1950 Joan completed six weeks of training in Wendover and Hyden in Kentucky before being allocated to the outpost of Flat Creek by the Red Bird River. The Nursing Service centre covered many families in a five-mile radius. There were two horses allocated to the centre, and Joan's horse Doc became a close companion on her many journeys. Joan's mother died while a severe winter took hold of Kentucky. By the following summer Joan was looking for work in a developing nation again and found a post with the World Health Organization, the team led by Jean Orkney, whose work had inspired Joan many years ago. At the same time Joan's relationship with Harry had ended when his wife found out about their affair. Pakistan 1951 - 1955 Joan arrived in Lahore, Pakistan in May 1951 to work with Jean Orkney training community health workers. Lahore was a city Joan had always wanted to visit - said to have been founded by Alexander the Great, one of her heroes, and home to Kipling's Kim, her role model. In 1951 there was a lot of political unrest following the partition of India and Joan dealt mainly with refugees. As part of this team Joan introduced family planning as part of their initiative. During this period she met and fell in love with a local programme director who she named only as Hussein. After the two-year contract in Lahore finished, Joan spent a month in England before returning to Pakistan, this time based in Karachi. Hoping to be reunited with Hussein she found that he had in fact agreed to an arranged marriage in her absence. Her family planning initiative earned Joan a rebuke from the Ministry of Health, who said they needed young men for the army. Considering the issues, Joan began to feel that social work would be a more appropriate career for her than nursing. She returned to London in May 1955, taking with her her beloved Siamese cat Simon. London and Smith College, Massachusetts 1957 - 1967 After two years of a social work course, Joan was successful in her application to London School of Economics to study for a diploma in psychiatric social work. At the end of the two years, anxieties from her chaotic upbringing came to a head and she entered four years of psychoanalysis with Dr Margaret Collins. After emerging from a period of anxiety and depression, she applied to do a master's degree in psychiatric social work at Smith College, Massachusetts. At some time in the mid 1960s Joan also spent time in Turkey working for the World Health Organization. NSPCC 1967 - 1971 On her return to London, Joan took up a position with the NSPCC as team leader to pioneer research and treatment for battered babies. In 1968 the Battered Child Research Unit was set up in Denver House, Ladbroke Grove and Joan became its first director.Crescy Cannan, Changing Families, Routledge 1992 Joan's work in the department became renowned and she had many visitors nationally and internationally, as well as a great demand for public talks and media interviews. Her favourite visitor was Dame Eileen Younghusband, a famous international pioneer of social work, who became a mentor to Joan over the next twenty years until her death in 1981. Joan was highly influential in promoting child abuse as a social problem category and wrote prolifically on the subject in various welfare journals.Articles by Joan Court included the following: Battering Parents, Social Wk.

On the way she stayed in Kabul, from where she visited the Buddha statues at Bamiyan. Following a disagreement over the prosecution of a single mother, and a direct challenge to the director of the NSPCC, Joan found herself summarily dismissed in 1972, which in turn brought letters of protest in the Times and many petitions but she was not reinstated. Civil Service 1972 - 1977 Joan's next position was in the Social Services Inspectorate of the Department of Health and Social Services. Over the next five years she advised ministers including Sir Keith Joseph on legislation in connection with abused children, and made appearances as an expert witness in court. Cambridge, UK, 1977 At age 57 Joan was approaching compulsory retirement at 60. Fortunately at this time she met an old friend from the convent in Torquay, Professor Mary Douglas, who was now a distinguished anthropologist. Taking some of Mary's books to St Lucia on holiday, Joan realised that she wanted a change of career, to social anthropology. Despite already having an MA in social work, she was accepted onto the undergraduate degree course in social anthropology at Cambridge University, studying at New Hall. She moved to Cambridge in 1977 and made a lifelong friend, Nicola Carmichael, while studying there. When she graduated in 1979 Joan went off to Bengal where she met her friend Bela who she knew from the Calcutta riots in 1946. After a brief attempt at anthropological study in Orissa Joan decided this was not for her and returned to Cambridge, becoming a child protection officer representing children as a Guardian Ad Litem. Animal Aid Cambridge In 1978 Joan went to protest in Trafalgar Square against the Canadian seal massacre. There she met Jean Pink, founder of Animal Aid, who told her about an anti-vivisection march in Cambridge. Joan attended the march, which was followed by a lecture by Hans Ruesch, and then a few days later Joan and a few others set up Animal Aid Cambridge. The new group quickly organised a small all-night vigil outside the Downing Site in Cambridge, where many animal experiments are carried out. The new group met at the Friends' Meeting House, run by Quakers, but were eventually evicted because protests at Huntingdon Research Centre (as Huntingdon Life Sciences was formerly called) were a concern to the Quakers. Joan made another lifelong friend, Hilda Ruse, at Animal Aid meetings from about 1979. Animal Rights Cambridge, 1982 Following disagreements, Joan split from Animal Aid Cambridge around 1982 and formed a new group, Animal Rights Cambridge, which still meets today. A prominent campaign of this era was the protest against Club Row in London, where puppies and kittens were sold in the market with no regard for their welfare. Joan and Hilda went to this protest in 1983 - eventually the sale of pets was stopped. Hilda also took part in Animal Liberation Front raids and some of Joan's rabbits came from such raids. Campaigns and protests With Animal Rights Cambridge Joan organised many campaigns against animal abuse. In the mid 1990s, as well as attending protests in Dover and Brightlingsea against the live export of animals to Europe, she staged a hunger strike outside the Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries against the trade. Campaigning moved to anti- vivisection after this, with ARC joining the campaign to close down Hillgrove Farm, which bred cats for animal research. Hillgrove eventually went out of business and campaigners stepped up efforts against Huntingdon Life Sciences, forming Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty and setting up a protest camp. When Hilda died in 1997, some of her ashes were scattered at HLS. In July 2004 Joan, aged 85, sailed with Sea Shepherd on the Farley Mowat ship to protest against whaling. She travelled with companion Darren Collis, joining the expedition from Brazil. By 2004 Oxford University was coming under attack for its plans to set up a new animal laboratory. Joan protested outside the proposed site of the laboratory, undertaking a fast for 72 hours.Anna Lindsay, BBC News July 2004 In 2004 she had become a Buddhist with the Amida Trust and brought a spiritual dimension to protest. In 2007 Cambridge University also planned to set up a new primate laboratory on the edge of the city. Six national animal rights organisations joined to oppose this plan, with high- profile marches in Cambridge. Animal Rights Cambridge worked with a new organisation, Stop Primate Experiments At Cambridge (SPEAC); actions included a protest at the degree ceremony and a sit down protest in the major road that passed the proposed site. Joan was arrested for initiating this but the authorities were reluctant to prosecute an 88 year old. Joan also conducted another fast in protest. Even aged 91 Joan was still protesting against vivisection at Cambridge University, during the national University Vivisection Week of Action in 2010.Helen Mackreath, Animal rights activists invade Downing Site as mark of protest, Varsity, 20 April 2010 Author In 2002, Joan published In the Shadow of Mahatma Gandhi, her account of her life up to the point she moved to Cambridge. Her story of her many adventures was well received and encouraged her to write a sequel in 2009, The Bunny Hugging Terrorist, which covered the rest of her life in Cambridge and her animal rights activism. This led to a feature-length interview with her in the Cambridge Evening News.Alice Ryan, Joan's long march for animal rights, Cambridge Evening News 24 September 2009 Continuing the theme of explaining animal activism, she published in 2012 her third book, Animals Betrayed, Interviews with Animal Rights Activists. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire interviewed her about her last book in April 2013.

Morena Herrera (born ) is a Salvadoran feminist and social activist, noted for her work against her country's ban on abortion. During the Salvadoran Civil War, which ended in 1992, Herrera served as a left-wing freedom fighter for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) against the United States-supported government. She has been particularly active against abortion since it was abolished in 1997, and in 2009 began working with the Citizen‚Äôs Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, which she now heads. Herrera was named one of the BBC 100 Women in 2016 for her contributions to women's rights in El Salvador. Biography Active in campaigning for social change from a young age, during the Salvadoran Civil War, which ended in 1992, Herrera served as a left-wing freedom fighter. She fought for over ten years with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) against the United States-supported government. Herrera was outspoken on the Peace Accords, signed in 1992, which she saw as deeply problematic for women's rights in El Salvador. She has said of them: \\"Those accords left big holes when it came to women‚Äôs rights. I realized I had to fight another way. Women‚Äôs rights are human rights and they have to be a priority.\\" The situation for women and abortion has worsened since 1997, when changes in the penal code made abortion completely illegal, when it had previously been acceptable in severe cases where a woman's life was at risk or she had been raped. Due to the country being strictly Catholic, abortion is considered unacceptable, even for pregnant teenage girls who face many problems. Since the ban on abortion in El Salvador was passed in 1998, over 600 women accused of having an abortion have been sent to jail for up to forty years. The worst part of this unfortunate circumstance is that in most of these cases, the women had a miscarriage. Now they must deal with the sorrow of losing their child while being jailed for a 'crime' they did not commit. \\"Las 17\\" is a group of jailed women whose freedom Herrera and her colleagues have fought for. Although a few these women have been freed, despite all the efforts by Herrera and her colleagues, many more women have been convicted and sent to jail for the same crime. Herrera says that the government does not recognize women's reproductive rights, despite the risks a pregnancy places on the mother. Currently, a third of pregnancies in El Salvador come from teenage mothers, this could be partly due to young women being raped by the horrendous gangs that are prominent near San Salvador, the nation's capital. Therefore, these young women are more subject to having pregnancy complications since they are still growing and maturing themselves. Political figures don't want to discard the ban on abortion because they fear the church and certain organizations such as the \\"Yes to Life Foundation\\", will not elect them back to office. The idea of 'a woman's sole purpose is to be a mother and take care of the house' is a main one for the church and society of El Salvador, leading to the lack of support for a woman to be in control of her body. To make matters worse, contraception is very hard to obtain for most women and if they do obtain some, it usually does not work properly. Herrera hopes to have make change in the legal rights for women while Salvador Sanchez C√©ren is still president (until 2019), but while his job and life are on the line facing the gangs and society, the changes towards women's rights has been an incredibly slow process. Despite the plethora of obstacles Herrera still has to overcome and the frequent threats on her life and the life of her family members, she continues to work tediously each day towards a better, consented life for all women in El Salvador.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/el-salvador-morena-herrera- meet-the-former-marxist-guerrilla-fighting-for-reproductive-rights-in- a-a7119711.htmlhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/01/defying-el- salvador-s-total-ban-on-abortion/ Since 2009, Herrera has worked with the Citizen‚Äôs Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion, which she now heads. In 2013 she was outspoken when the Supreme Court of El Salvador denied an abortion to a terminally ill woman, who stood no chance of surviving the birth, calling them \\"irresponsible\\". Her work was subject to a report by Amnesty International in January 2015, and in 2016 she was named one of the BBC 100 Women.

She showed top-class form as a juvenile in 2014 when she won her first three races including the Prix de Cabourg before finishing third in the Prix Morny and second in the Prix Marcel Boussac. In the following year she won the Prix Imprudence and then recorded Group One wins in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Coronation Stakes. Later that season she added another major victory when she took the Prix du Moulin. In 2016 she failed to win but ran prominently in several major races. Background Ervedya is a bay mare with small white star bred in France by her owner Aga Khan IV. She was trained throughout her racing career by Jean- Claude Rouget and ridden in most of her races by Christophe Soumillon. She was from the first crop of foals sired by the Aga Khan's stallion Siyouni whose biggest win came in the 2009 running of the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re. His other offspring have included Siyoushake (Prix Perth), Spectre (Prix Imprudence), Volta (Prix de Sandringham), Bourree (Prix de Psych√©), Finsbury Square (Prix de Meautry) and Trixia (Prix des R√©servoirs). Ervedya's dam Elva, showed good racing ability, winning two minor races and finishing second in the Prix Vanteaux. She was a female-line descendant of the French mare Sanaa (foaled 1931) who was the ancestor of several other major winners including Esmeralda (Prix Morny), Coronation, Danedream, Gentoo (Prix Royal-Oak) and Falco (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Ervedya made a successful racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1100 metres at Tarbes on 29 May 2014, winning by a neck from Lostinparadise. In June at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse she started at odds of 1.6/1 for the Prix Pirette over 1200 metres and won by one and a quarter lengths from the odds-on favourite Malicieuse. On 3 August, the filly was stepped up in class for the Group Three Prix de Cabourg over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse and started at odds of 6/1 in an eight-runner field. Ridden by Thierry Jarnet she took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths and a nose from the colts City Money and El Suizo. Three weeks later, over the same course and distance, Ervedya started joint-favourite for the Group One Prix Morny. After being restrained by Soumillon in the early stages she finished strongly to take third place behind the colts The Wow Signal (from England) and Hootenanny (from the United States). On her final appearance of the season Ervedya contested the Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October and started second favourite behind the Irish filly Found. Despite an unfavourable draw on the outside of the twelve-runner she disputed the lead from the start but was overtaken in last 100 metres and beaten two and a half lengths into second place by Found. =2015: three-year-old season= Ervedya began her second season in the Group Three Prix Imprudence over 1400 metres on very soft ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 2 April and started the 11/8 favourite ahead of the Italian filly Fontenalice (Premio Dormello), Ameenah (Prix Miesque) and Queen Bee (Prix du Calvados). After racing towards the rear of the thirteen runner field she accelerated into the lead 200 metres from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and three quarter lengths from Ameenah. On 10 May Ervedya was stepped back up to Group One class for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp and started favourite against thirteen opponents. Ameenah, Queen Bee and Fontenalice were again in the field whilst the other runners included Mexican Gold (Prix de la Grotte) and Sainte Amarante the winner of the Listed Prix la Camargo. Ridden with great confidence by Soumillon, Ervedya raced at the rear of the field before accelerating into the lead in the last 200 metres and winning comfortably by three quarters of a length from the British-trained outsider Irish Rookie. After the race Rouget commented \\"She has Group 1 acceleration, is easy to train and easy to ride. She didn't get away all that well but that wasn't too serious and Christophe had her nicely hidden away\\". On her next appearance, Ervedya was sent to England and started second favourite behind Found in the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot on 19 June. The other seven runners included Lucida (Rockfel Stakes), Arabian Queen, Irish Rookie and Sperry (Michael Seely Memorial Stakes). After being restrained by Soumillon in the early stages, as Arabian Queen set the pace Ervedya began to make rapid progress in the straight. She overtook Found inside the final furlong and won by a neck with Lucida a half length back in third ahead of the outsider Miss Temple City. Explaining his tactics Soumillon said \\"I knew she had a good turn of foot so I just wanted to try to follow one or two good fillies to bring me to the final furlong. At the entrance to the straight, I saw that Ryan was going very easily on Found and that around her everybody was a bit [tired] and I thought that I‚Äôd find a gap. When I came through, she gave me the turn of foot to make it right on the line.\\" Jean- Claude Rouget commented \\"It was a big dream to come and win a group I here. She's the best; mentally she is fantastic and that makes her the best\\". On 2 August Ervedya was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville. She started the odds on favourite but after taking the lead 300 metres from the finish she was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten one and a quarter lengths by the British-trained four-year-old Amazing Maria. The Group One Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 13 September saw Ervedya start odds-on favourite ahead of the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Karakontie. The other four runners were Maimara (Prix de Lieurey), Giuliani (Bayerisches Zuchtrennen), Wild Chief (Meilen-Trophy) and Akatea (Prix Finlande). After racing in second place behind Karakontie, the filly took the lead inside the last 200 metres and stayed on well to win by a length from Akatea. After the race the Aga Khan said \\"There was a slight moment where I wondered whether the jockey would get there in time as it didn't look as though things were going to open up with the other horse on her outside. I think we will probably keep her in training as a four-year-old, as there is nothing particularly in the programme for her now that looks interesting. She's very sound and healthy, so I see no reason why we shouldn't\\". =2016: four-year-old season= On 1 May at Saint-Cloud Racecourse Ervedya began her third campaign by starting odds-on favourite for the Prix du Muguet and finished second, beaten three and a half lengths by the five-year-old Vadamos. In June she made her second appearance at Royal Ascot and started the 9/2 joint-favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes over one mile. After being held up at the rear of the field she made some progress in the last quarter mile but never looked likely to win and finished fifth behind Tepin, Belardo, Lighting Spear and Toormore. In the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville in August she came from well off the pace to finish third behind Ribchester and Vadamos with Esoterique and Galileo Gold among the other beaten horses. On her final run of the year Ervedya was sent to England for the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 October. Ridden by Christophe Lemaire she tracked the leaders before staying on in the closing stages to finish third behind the Irish filly Alice Springs. Assessment and awards In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Ervedya was given a rating of 115 making her the 205th best racehorse in the world and the ninth-best three-year-old filly.

Tiwaz (Stem: Tiwad-) was the Luwian Sun-god. He was among the most important gods of the Luwians.  Name  The name of the Proto-Anatolian Sun god can be reconstructed as *Diuod-, which derives from the Proto-Indo-European word *dei- (\\"shine\\", \\"glow\\"). This name is cognate with the Greek Zeus, Latin Jupiter, and Norse Tyr or Tor. While Tiwaz (and the related Palaic god Tiyaz) retained a promenant role in the pantheon, the Hittite cognate deity, was largely eclipsed by the Sun goddess of Arinna, becoming a god of the day, especially the day of death. In Luwian cuneiform of the Bronze Age, his name appears as Tiwad-. It can also be written with the Sumerogram dUTU (\\"God- Sun\\"). In Hieroglyphic Luwian of the Iron Age, the name can be written as Tiwad- of with the ideogram (DEUS) SOL (\\"God-Sun\\") Tiwaz rarely appears in personal names. The oldest example derives from 19th century BC K√ºltepe, a person called \\"Tiwatia\\".Ilya Yakubovich: Sociolinguistics of the Luvian Language. Dissertation, Chicago 2008, pp. 269 f. (PDF; 2.2 MB). The hieroglyphic Luwian name (\\"Beloved of Tiwaz\\") is the root of the Pamphylian town of Aspendos. The local name of the town, according to the legends on its coins was Estwedi- (ŒïŒ£Œ§œúŒïŒîŒôŒôŒ•). Unlike other Luwian gods' names, Tiwaz is not attested in southern Anatolian personal names of the Hellenistic period. A Lyican women's name, Tewidarma (Œ§ŒµœÖŒ¥ŒπŒ±œÅŒºŒ±; \\"Sun-Moon\\") and a Lydian patronym, Tiwdalis, are derived from Tiwaz. The name also appears in ·∏™UR.SAGTiwata≈°≈°a, the Hittite name for a mountain located somewhere in southwestern Anatolia.  Role  Tiwaz was the descendant of the male sky god of the Indo-European religion, Dyeus, who was superseded among the Hittites by the Hattian Sun goddess of Arinna. In Bronze Age texts, Tiwaz is often referred to as \\"Father\\" (cuneiform Luwian: tatis Tiwaz) and once as \\"Great Tiwaz\\" (cuneiform Luwian: urazza- dUTU-az), and invoked along with the \\"Father gods\\" (cuneiform Luwian: tatinzi ma≈°≈°aninzi). His Bronze Age epithet, \\"Tiwaz of the Oath\\" (cuneiform Luwian: ·∏´irutalla- dUTU-az), indicates that he was an oath-god. In this role he received sacrifices of sheep, red meat and bread. The Luwian verb tiwadani- (\\"to curse\\") is derived from Tiwaz's name. According to Hittite sources, Tiwaz and Kamru≈°epa were the parents of the tutelary god of . Like Kamru≈°epa, Tiwaz is closely associated with sheep. The god Hapantali, who worked with Kamru≈°epa in purification rituals, looked after his sheep in the myth of Telipinu.Volkert Haas: \\"Die G√∂ttin ·∏™apantali(ja) und die Schafe.\\" In: Piotr Taracha (Ed.): Silva Anatolica. Anatolian Studies Presented to Maciej Popko on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday. Agade, Warschau 2002, , pp. 143‚Äì146. His followers include the , who generally appear in bad situations. = Sun god of the Earth = In the Hittite and Hurrian religions the Sun goddess of the Earth played an important role in the death cult and was understood to be the ruler of the world of the dead. For the Luwians there is a Bronze Age source which refers to the \\"Sun god of the Earth\\" (cuneiform Luwian: tiyama≈°≈°i- dU- za): \\"If he is alive, may Tiwaz release him, if he is dead, may the Sun god of the Earth release him\\" (Boƒüazk√∂y cuneiform inscription, 35.48 ii 19.23).  Depiction  There are no known Bronze Age depictions of the Luwian Sun god. There are two reliefs from the Iron Age, which show Tiwaz with the moon god Arma. He is marked out by a winged sun above his head. The image from Arslantepe closely resembles the depiction of the Sun god from the Hittite sanctuary at Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya.

It was used Workington A.F.C. until they moved to their new Borough Park ground built next door on the west side of Lonsdale Park. Greyhound racing Racing began in 1933 but came under new management in 1942. The racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). In the 1960s racing was on Monday and Saturday nights at 7.00pm over distances of 320 and 500 yards. The track circumference was a large 440 yards and an 'Inside Sumner' hare system was used. The principal race was the Workington Derby and amenities included a members club and snack bar. By the late 1980s the distances were 320, 530 and 760 yards, there were kennels on site for 50 greyhounds and a car park for 200 vehicles. Facilities included three bars and a covered stand.

Built in 1891‚Äì92 for the president of a patent medicine maker, it is one of the city's finest examples of Queen Anne Victorian architecture executed in brick and stone. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The house was for many years home to the Delta Psi fraternity; is now owned by the University of Vermont. Description and history The Edward Wells House is located in eastern Burlington, at the northwest corner of Maple and Summit Streets. It is a large 2¬Ω story structure, built out of stone and brick, capped by a truncated hip roof. The first floor is finished in rustically cut reddish limestone, laid in random courses, while the upper levels are finished in brown brick. The main facade is three bays wide, each with a different configuration of windows and decoration. Each bay is topped in the roof by a gabled dormer, that on the left larger than the other two. All three dormers feature terra cotta panels in the gable peaks, and have diamond-paned sash windows. The main entrance is sheltered by a deep hip-roofed porch, supported by clusters of round columns set on stone piers. The interior features lavish woodwork. with The house was built in 1891‚Äì92 for Edward Wells, who rose to great fortune in the manufacture of patent medicines. Wells was instrumental in the success of the Wells-Richardson Company, which advertised widely, and sold its products by mail order. The house was designed by Edgar Allan Poe Newcomb of Boston, Massachusetts. Its interior wood carvings were executed by Albert H. Whittekind of New York City, whose credits include carvings in the New York Public Library Main Branch and the current Chittenden County Superior Courthouse. Wells died in 1907, and his house was acquired in 1924 by the Delta Psi fraternity. By 2003, the fraternity was in decline, and in 2007 the house was purchased by the University of Vermont, which adapted for use as a guest quarters for visiting alumnae.

Proposed or suggested developments =Bury stops= Buckley Wells tram stop and Elton Reservoir tram stop have been proposed to provide better passenger access in southern Bury, and would be on the Bury Line between Bury Interchange and Radcliffe tram stop. =Middleton extension= As of 2013, Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council aspires to link Middleton to the Metrolink network by constructing a branch off the Bury Line routed from Bowker Vale tram stop to Middleton town centre. Rochdale Council first proposed this extension of Metrolink to Middleton in 2008, and priced the scheme at ¬£80 million. In June 2018, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) signalled their support for a Middleton extension after a meeting with the council. In January 2019, it was revealed as part of a plan for new houses in Greater Manchester that the Metrolink would be extended to Middleton. =Oldham extension= In January 2016, Jim McMahon, MP for Oldham West and Royton, proposed two loop extensions to the metrolink system around Oldham: * A spur from Westwood tram stop on the Oldham and Rochdale line to Middleton town centre, then joining the Bury line near Bowker Vale, in line with the proposed Middleton extension. * The Ashton Loop, extending the line beyond Ashton town centre to Oldham Mumps. Both would connect Rochdale to its neighbouring towns without the need to travel in and out of Manchester city centre. Initial high level feasibility work was undertaken by officials at TfGM that demonstrated the route is technically possible.http://www.oldham- chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/96391/jims-loop-lines-vision- for-trams  Retrieved 01 February 2016 =Salford expansion= In Salford City Council's 2004‚Äì2016 unitary development plan: * Extending from Eccles Interchange along the A57 road to Barton-upon-Irwell and then across the Manchester Ship Canal to the Trafford Centre. * Re-opening the Tyldesley Loopline from Eccles to Little Hulton via Walkden with Metrolink services. * Tram-train between Manchester and Wigan via Salford, as proposed by the Regional Spatial Strategy for North West England. In January 2019, it was revealed as part of a plan for new houses in Greater Manchester that the Metrolink would be extended to Salford Stadium. =Stalybridge extension= The Stockport‚ÄìStalybridge line as a proposed line of Metrolink As of 2011, Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council aspires to extend the East Manchester Line from Ashton-under-Lyne to Stalybridge. In January 2019, it was revealed as part of a plan for new houses in Greater Manchester that the Metrolink would be extended to Stalybridge. =Stockport tram-train strategy= In January 2015 Stockport Metropolitan Borough adopted a Rail Strategy proposing substantial conversion of current rail alignments around Stockport to tram- train operation, running into an interchange at Stockport bus station. These proposed services expand on, and are consistent with, those outlined in the TfGM tram-train strategy document. Earlier plans (now discarded) had envisaged the Metrolink line to East Didsbury being extended to Stockport along the Mersey Valley. The revised plan proposes instead a revised alignment for this link via Edgeley and Stockport railway station. * Stockport town centre to Manchester city centre via Heaton Norris, Reddish South and Belle Vue (linking with the proposed Manchester ‚Äì Marple tram-train line); * Stockport town centre to Manchester Airport via Edgeley and Baguley; * Stockport town centre to Altrincham via Edgeley and Baguley; * Stockport town centre to East Didsbury (and on to Manchester city centre), via Edgeley, Gorsey Bank and Cheadle Heath; * Hazel Grove to East Didsbury via Gorsey Bank. In the Rail Strategy, Stockport MBC also outline longer term aspirations to establish tram-train services between Stockport town centre and Marple; and between Stockport town centre and Ashton town centre. In January 2020 it was announced TfGM and Stockport Council are preparing to ask for funding for a long planned direct Metrolink line from the end of the South Manchester line at East Didsbury to the new Stockport transport interchange. =Tram-trains= Metrolink and the TfGM Committee have prepared five costed proposals for extending Metrolink using tram-train technology over the existing heavy rail network in the region; along the Mid-Cheshire Line (between Stockport and Hale), the Hope Valley Line (between Manchester and Marple), the Glossop Line (between Manchester and the dual termini at Hadfield and Glossop), the Manchester to Sheffield Line (between Manchester and Hazel Grove), and along the Manchester to Southport Line (between Manchester and Wigan via Atherton), with an estimated total funding requirement of ¬£870 million as of 2013. TfGM intend to proceed to the identification of potential rail industry funding options, subject to a review of lessons from a tram-train pilot scheme on the Sheffield Supertram system. =Wythenshawe Loop= Although axed in 2005 to control costs, the Wythenshawe Loop on the Airport Line remains an aspiration of TfGM. As of October 2014 there is renewed interest from TFGM, particularly as the route could link with HS2 Manchester Interchange. It would create a loop from Roundthorn tram stop to the Wythenshawe Hospital and Newall Green and back to Roundthorn, and improve access between Wythenshawe and Manchester city centre on a route which is physically impaired by the River Mersey and M60 motorway.

He later served as Superintendent of the District of Columbia Police Department, and was in large measure held responsible for the violence that ended the 1932 Bonus Army protests. The son of a career Army officer, Glassford graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1904 and was commissioned in the Field Artillery. His early assignments included the 1st Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Riley, the West Point faculty and 1st Field Artillery postings to the Philippines and Hawaii. In 1916 and 1917 he served with the 5th Field Artillery during the Pancho Villa Expedition. During World War I, Glassford directed two artillery schools in France, commanded a Field Artillery regiment, and then commanded a Field Artillery brigade. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1918, and was the Army‚Äôs youngest general officer at the time. After the war, Glassford commanded a Field Artillery Brigade in the Army of Occupation. He also graduated from the Army War College, served in several staff and faculty assignments, and commanded the 1st Field Artillery Regiment. He retired from the Army in 1931. Following his military retirement, Glassford was Superintendent of the District of Columbia Police, a position he resigned because of disagreement over the actions taken against the Bonus Army in 1932. He subsequently served briefly as chief of police in Phoenix, and was a federal labor-management mediator in California. During World War II, Glassford returned to active duty and served for nearly two years in the office of the Provost Marshal General. In his later years, Glassford‚Äôs hobbies included painting; he created landscapes and seascapes in watercolors. His works continue to be exhibited, and are bought and sold by collectors. Glassford died in California in 1959. He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. Early life Glassford was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico on August 8, 1883, the son of Allie (Seymour) Glassford and Army officer William A. Glassford (1853‚Äì1931). He graduated from West Point in 1904 ranked 18th of 124 graduates, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Field Artillery. Start of career After his initial service at Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1907 Glassford was promoted to first lieutenant and graduated from the Mounted Service School. He was then posted to West Point to serve on the faculty as an instructor in the department of drawing. From 1911 to 1913, Glassford served in the Philippines with the 1st Field Artillery Regiment. In 1913 he was assigned to Hawaii with the 1st Field Artillery, and in 1914 he was promoted to captain. In 1916 and 1917, Glassford served on the US-Mexico border with the 5th Field Artillery during the Pancho Villa Expedition. At the start of World War I, he was promoted to major and assigned as adjutant of the 5th Field Artillery during its premobilization training. World War I Upon arrival in France with his regiment, Glassford was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and assigned as secretary of the Field Artillery School of Instruction in Saumur. He was subsequently assigned as director of the I Corps field artillery school. In early 1918, Glassford returned to the Saumur school as commandant, and he served until he was promoted to temporary colonel and named commander of the 103rd Field Artillery Regiment in June. Glassford commanded the 103rd Field Artillery until August, and took part in several battles, including Xivray-et-Marvoisin, the Second Battle of the Marne, the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He was wounded in September, but continued in command. In October, Glassford was promoted to temporary brigadier general and assigned to command the 51st Field Artillery Brigade, 26th Division; at the time of this promotion, he was the youngest general officer in the Army. During the war, Glassford became known for riding a motorcycle between his subordinate units so he could perform reconnaissance and conduct command and control based on personal observations rather than reports to a command post. Glassford trained his brigade to become proficient in the technique of reloading on a cannon's recoil; while this practice posed risk to crew members who might be injured by the moving recoil mechanism, it enabled 26th Division artillery crews to shoot so fast that German soldiers were convinced the Americans had automatic fire artillery pieces. Post-World War I Glassford commanded the 51st Field Artillery Brigade until February 1919, when he was assigned to command the 152nd Field Artillery Brigade, a unit of the 77th Division. He returned to the United States with his brigade in July, reverted to his permanent rank of major, and was assigned to the office of the Chief of Field Artillery. Later that year he was assigned to the faculty of the General Service Schools at Ft. Leavenworth. In 1924, Glassford graduated from the Army War College, after which he remained at the school to serve on the faculty. In 1927 and 1928, Glassford commanded the 1st Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill. Glassford subsequently returned to the War Department staff and served as chief of the Mobilization Branch in the Operations and Training Division. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1928. Glassford retired in July 1931, and his rank of brigadier general was restored at his retirement as the result of a 1930 law which enabled World War I generals to retire at the highest rank they had held. During his career, Glassford was known for his out of the ordinary excursions into fields outside the Army. He would frequently save his military leave, and then use it in large blocs to take long motorcycle trips or work in jobs that were atypical for a military professional, which included circus barker and newspaper reporter. Later career =Washington, DC police chief= In November 1931, Glassford was appointed Superintendent of the District of Columbia‚Äôs Metropolitan Police Department. Known for his sense of humor, when queried by a reporter as to his qualifications for the job, Glassford quipped: \\"Well, I've been arrested. Once for driving through a red light and once for speeding on a motorcycle.\\" His tenure was most notable for the Summer 1932 response to the Bonus Army, World War I veterans who converged on Washington during the Great Depression to advocate for early payment of bonuses that were scheduled to be paid in 1945. Members of the Bonus Army established encampments in and around the District of Columbia. Glassford worked to accommodate them, visiting their leaders daily by motorcycle to help maintain order, and arranging for volunteers to provide medical care, as well as donations of food, clothing, tents, and other supplies. Favorable Congressional action was not forthcoming, and many Bonus Army members accepted the government's offer of free transportation home. President Herbert Hoover ordered the remaining veterans to be removed, by force if necessary. Glassford managed to obtain a six day extension before enforcement, hoping to persuade the Bonus Army members to depart voluntarily. On July 28, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans who remained to be removed from government property. Glassford‚Äôs police began to execute the order; they were met with resistance, and during an exchange of shots, two veterans were wounded and later died. After the shooting, President Herbert Hoover ordered the Army to force the veterans' out of the Washington area. General Douglas MacArthur, the Chief of Staff of the Army, took personal command of infantry and cavalry units, which were supported by six tanks. The Army forcibly ejected the Bonus Army members, and wives and children who had accompanied some of them were also force to leave. The Army then burned the campsites. Glassford had established a positive relationship with leaders of the Bonus Army, and disagreed with Hoover and Mitchell about the need to eject the members and destroy the campsites. He also disagreed with the need to use Army troops against the Bonus Army, which brought him into conflict with other members of the police department leadership. When Glassford was unable to name appointees who agreed with his policies, he submitted his own resignation, and left the police department in December 1932. =Move to Arizona= Glassford retired to a farm near Phoenix. He mounted a brief run for governor of Arizona in 1934, and also that year accepted a federal appointment to mediate labor-management disputes between workers and owners of lettuce and cantaloupe farms in Imperial Valley, California. Faced with workers striking in an effort to obtain better pay and working conditions, conservative farm owners resorted to violence, spying on attorneys sent to California to aid the workers, and propaganda asserting that the strike was communist-inspired. Though Glassford was initially sympathetic to the farm owners, their tactics caused him to come down on the side of the workers. =Phoenix police chief= In March 1936, Glassford was hired to serve as chief of the Phoenix Police Department for 90 days. The temporary appointment came with a mandate to reorganize and reform the department to end corruption and outside political influence, and restore morale. He left the position on May 1, when a new mayor and city council took office and decided on a different reorganization plan. In September 1936, Glassford was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in Arizona's 1st congressional district. World War II In March 1942, Glassford was recalled to active duty for World War II and assigned to duty as internal security director in the office of the Provost Marshal General. He retired again in December 1943. Awards Glassford was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Purple Heart. Career as artist Glassford was an artist; among friends in the military, he was well known for his paintings of fireplace screens. After his military retirement, he worked primarily in watercolors; his second wife and he resided in Laguna Beach, California, and many of Glassford‚Äôs paintings depicted scenes of Newport Beach, Balboa Harbor and other areas of the southern California coast. Death and burial Glassford died in Laguna Beach on August 9, 1959. He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego. Family In 1908, Glassford married Cora Carleton (1887‚Äì1958), the daughter of US Army General Guy Carleton (1857‚Äì1946). They were the parents of four children: Guy Carleton (1908‚Äì1974), Cora Elizabeth (Mrs. Lee Parke) (1910‚Äì1986), Pelham Davis (1911‚Äì1992), and Dorothy Seymour (Mrs. William Graham) (1913‚Äì1977). The Glassfords divorced in 1932. In 1934, Pelham Glassford married Lucille Painter (1906‚Äì1957). Glassford‚Äôs brother William A. Glassford, was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy who attained the rank of vice admiral before retiring in 1946. Biography Cora Carleton Glassford prepared a biography of her husband, One Life is Not Enough, the manuscript for which is part of the Cora Carleton Glassford Papers.

She has since been Curator of Ethnobotany at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, and is also an adjunct professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis. One of the focuses of her recent research has been the alpine environment of the Himalayas, and in particular, the effects of climate change and human activities. She worked with partners in China, Nepal and Bhutan to establish the Himalayan team of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA), an international network that aims to document plant life diversity in alpine regions globally and to study how it is affected by climate change over time. Plants used in traditional medicine and other forms of traditional knowledge are another interest. With Wayne Law, Salick documented how the cotton-headed snow lotus (Saussurea laniceps), a rare species of Himalayan snow lotus used in traditional Chinese medicine and also often collected by tourists, has decreased in height over a century, apparently in response to pressure from humans selectively picking taller plants. She has also published on the impact of traditional agricultural and forestry practices, for example, among the Yanesha (or Amuesha) people living on the upper Amazon in Peru. Salick served as a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU) Study Group on sustainable development in 2001‚Äì2. In 2007, with Anja Byg, she organized a symposium on climate change and indigenous peoples, held at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Oxford University, UK. In 2009, with Nancy Ross, she edited a special edition of the journal Global Environmental Change entitled \\"Traditional Peoples and Climate Change\\". She co-edited (with Katie Konchar and Mark Nesbitt) the 2014 textbook, Curating Biocultural Collections, published by Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which won the Postgraduate Textbook Prize of the Royal Society of Biology in 2015. Awards and honors Salick is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1992) and the Linnean Society of London. She served as president of the Society for Economic Botany in 1997‚Äì98 and received the society's Distinguished Economic Botanist award in 2014.

Horses, white, yellow, red rising on hind legs against the ruby-red sky and symbolizing life power, or a dragon representing the evil, all dwell in Jevtovic's rosy heaven like an eternal counterpoint: the fight between the real and imagined, good and bad‚Ä¶ Dozens of portraits of human groups are connected by various incidents. The artist's sense of movement and crowd arrangement shows his innate feeling of composition. Gestures, clothes, and habits display features typical of the area and the people in ecstatic mood. The artist wishes to connect them with a ritual and therefore applies a pictorial structure resulting in perfect and imaginative observations. Thus, his paintings are raised from more description to the heights of distinctive painting formulae.–ù. –ö—Ä—Å—Ç–∏—õ, –ù–∞–∏–≤–Ω–∞ —É–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ, –°–ê–ù–£, –ú–ù–ú–£,–à–∞–≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞, 2003  Exhibitions and awards  Du≈°an Jevtoviƒá participated in representative exhibitions in the country and abroad, such as Salons and Biennials of Na√Øve art in Jagodina, Munich (1968), Rome and Tokyo (1971), Paris, Belgrade (2003), Sofia (2007), Budapest (2008), and in significant international exhibitions: Lugano (1969), Naivi (1979, 1973, 1977).

It became part of the Territorial Force in 1908 and served under various designations as field artillery in Palestine during World War I, and as heavy anti-aircraft artillery in North Africa and Italy during World War II. It disappeared in a merger in 1955. Artillery Volunteers 1859‚Äì1908 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. The 1st Norfolk Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) was formed at Great Yarmouth on 29 September 1859, with further batteries being added on 23 February and 4 June 1860, and 26 December 1862. In January 1864 several AVCs from Essex and Suffolk were attached to the 1st Norfolk for administration, and in November that year the 1st Administrative Brigade of Norfolk Artillery Volunteers was formed with the following composition:Frederick, p. 666.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 67, 135 & 156.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Norfolk and Suffolk Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org. * 1st Norfolk AVC ‚Äì two batteries at Great Yarmouth * 2nd Norfolk AVC ‚Äì two batteries formed from the Norwich men of the 1st Norfolk AVC 1869 * 1st Essex AVC‚Äì formed at Harwich on 18 February 1869 * 1st Suffolk AVC ‚Äì formed at Lowestoft on 19 July 1860 * 2nd Suffolk AVC‚Äì formed at Walton-on-the-Naze on 15 October 1860; disbanded 1871 * 3rd Suffolk AVC‚Äì formed 1864 at Aldeburgh from 21st Suffolk Rifle Volunteer Corps (raised in June 1861). * 4th Suffolk AVC ‚Äì formed at Beccles on 14 July 1868 In the early years the corps used large coastal artillery guns at Great Yarmouth.Trafford. When the Volunteers were reorganised in April 1880 the 1st Norfolk Admin Bde was consolidated into a single unit with headquarters at Great Yarmouth. The batteries were distributed as follows: * 1st and 2nd Batteries ‚Äì Great Yarmouth, Norfolk * 3rd and 4th Batteries ‚Äì Norwich, Norfolk (former 2nd Corps) * No 5 Battery ‚Äì Harwich (late 1st Essex Corps) * No 6 Battery ‚Äì Lowestoft (late 1st Suffolk Artillery Volunteers) * No 7 Battery ‚Äì Aldborough (late 3rd Suffolk Artillery Volunteers) * No 8 Battery ‚Äì Beccles (late 4th Suffolk Artillery Volunteers) However, the Essex volunteers were unhappy with the arrangements and left, so the Suffolk batteries were renumbered as Nos 5, 6 and 7. The unit became the 1st Norfolk (Norfolk & Suffolk) AVC, and was attached to the Eastern Division of the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1886.Army Lists, various dates. As well as manning fixed coast defence artillery, some of the early Artillery Volunteers manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. But the War Office refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for Volunteers and they had largely died out in the 1870s. In 1888 the 'position artillery' concept was revived and some Volunteer companies were reorganised as position batteries to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. On 14 July 1892 the 1st Norfolk Volunteer Artillery were reorganised as three position batteries and seven garrison companies:Beckett, p. 178.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. * HQ and No 1 Battery ‚Äì Great Yarmouth * Nos 2 and 3 Batteries ‚Äì Norwich * No 4 Company ‚Äì Beccles and Harleston * Nos 5 and 6 Companies ‚Äì Lowestoft * No 7 Company ‚Äì Aldeburgh and Orford * No 8 Company ‚Äì Beccles * No 9 Company ‚Äì Southwold * No 10 Company ‚Äì Harleston The Artillery Volunteers were transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) in 1899, and when the RA's divisional structure was abolished on 1 January 1902 the unit was redesignated as the 1st Norfolk RGA (Volunteers). An affiliated Cadet Corps was formed at Beccles in 1906. Territorial Force In 1908 on the formation of the Territorial Force the Norfolk batteries of the 1st Norfolk became the I East Anglian Brigade Royal Field Artillery (TF). (The I (1st) Brigade was going to have been numbered II (2nd), but this was changed by October 1908.) Also formed at the same time from the Suffolk batteries was the III East Anglian (Howitzer) Brigade, comprising the 1st and 2nd Suffolk (Howitzer) Batteries and the 3rd East Anglian Ammunition Column.Frederick, p. 675.Litchfield, p. 135.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Litchfield, p. 217.Norfolk Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org. The 15-pounder gun The new brigade was organised as follows:Osborne, p. 204 * HQ at The Barracks, Surrey Street, Norwich * 1st Norfolk Battery at Nelson Road, Great YarmouthNelson Drill Hall at Great War Centenary Drill Halls * 2nd Norfolk Battery at Norwich * 3rd Norfolk Battery at Norwich * 1st East Anglian Ammunition Column at Norwich The Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Norfolks since 1888 had been Colonel the Earl of Stradbroke, VD; he became Honorary Colonel of the new unit (while remaining CO of the III East Anglian (H) Bde). The brigade formed part of the East Anglian Division of the TF. By 1914 the batteries were each equipped with four 15-pounder guns.Becke, Part 2a, pp. 125‚Äì31.54 (1st EA) Div at Long, Long Trail. World War I =Mobilisation= The East Anglian Division began its annual training on 27 July 1914 and by 3 August the divisional artillery had concentrated at the Redesdale training area in Northumberland. When the order to mobilise was given on 4 August, the units returned to their headquarters and then moved to their war stations. By 10 August the division had concentrated around Brentwood, Essex, and on 20 August it moved to Chelmsford and formed part of the coast defences of the UK until the following May. Meanwhile, the formation of duplicate or 2nd Line TF units from Home Service men and recruits had been authorised, and towards the end of 1914 the 2nd East Anglian Division came into existence at Peterborough. The original (1st Line) I East Anglian Brigade became the 1/I and its 2nd Line became the 2/I East Anglian Brigade.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 91‚Äì8.69 (2nd EA) Div at Long, Long Trail. =1/I East Anglian Brigade= The 1st East Anglian Division was employed on coast defence until May 1915, when it was concentrated at St Albans preparatory to going overseas as the 54th (1st East Anglian) Division. However, when the infantry departed for the Gallipoli Campaign, the divisional artillery was left behind. In August it joined the 2nd Line at Thetford and Brandon, Suffolk, rearmed with modern 18-pounder guns and handed over its obsolete 15-pounders to the 2nd Line batteries. On 17 November 1915 the 54th Divisional Artillery embarked for France, where it joined 33rd Division, a 'Kitchener's Army' division whose artillery were still under training.Becke Pt 3b, pp. 31‚Äì9. After a month on the Western Front, during which parties of officers and men had been attached for training to other divisions in the Front Line, 54th Divisional Artillery was warned that it was to be transferred to Egypt to rejoin its parent division, which had been withdrawn from Gallipoli. Embarkation began at Marseille on 30 January 1916 and disembarkation was completed at Alexandria by 14 February. The divisional artillery rejoined 54th Division at Mena Camp near Cairo and in April moved into No 1 (Southern) Section of the Suez Canal defences. On 29 May 1916 the 1/I East Anglian Brigade was renumbered CCLXX (270) Brigade RFA and its batteries became A, B and C. It was renumbered again on 21 December, becoming CCLXXII (272) Brigade RFA, and was reorganised into two six-gun batteries, with C Battery split up between A and B.Frederick, p. 687. An 18-pounder crew in action in Sinai, 1916. The infantry battalions of 54th Division were slowly brought back up to strength with drafts from home during 1916, and by mid- January 1917 the whole division had assembled at Moascar in preparation for the British invasion of Sinai.Burrows, pp. 112, 127‚Äì8. After crossing the Wilderness,Burrows, p. 133. the division took part in the First (26‚Äì7 March) and Second Battle of Gaza (17‚Äì9 April) Between 26 June and 1 July 1917 the brigade was reorganised, with A Bty transferred to CCLXIV Bde of 52nd (Lowland) Divisional Artillery and C (Howitzer) Bty (originally the 1st Suffolk Battery, see above) joining from CCLXXI (1/II East Anglian) Bde. Henceforward the brigade comprised six 18-pounders in B Bty and four 4.5-inch howitzers in C Bty. The campaign was renewed in the autumn at the Third Battle of Gaza (27 October ‚Äì 7 November) and the final capture of Gaza (1‚Äì7 November). At the end of the year the division was engaged in the Battle of Jaffa (21‚Äì22 December). 54th Division was next engaged in the action at Berukin (9‚Äì10 April 1918). Finally it took part in the opening stage of Allenby's final offensive (the Battle of Megiddo), known as the Battle of Sharon (19‚Äì23 September). The division was then taken out of the line and concentrated at Haifa, where it was engaged in repairing communications for the rapidly advancing army. It next moved to Beirut, where it was concentrating when the Armistice of Mudros was signed with Turkey and hostilities ended on 31 October. In late November 1918 the division was ordered to return to Egypt, the artillery proceeding by sea and arriving in mid-December. Demobilisation began in January 1919, and the TF units were slowly reduced to cadres. In March and April, when its guns had been handed in and about one-third of its men had left, 54th Divisional Artillery was converted into an ad hoc cavalry regiment to act as mounted police during disturbances in Cairo. Demobilisation recommenced in May and was completed in June.Sainsbury, Hertfordshire Batteries, p. 88. =2/I East Anglian Brigade= Training for the 2nd Line artillery was hindered by the shortage of equipment, and several months passed before guns, horses and harness were received. Even then, only obsolete French De Bange 90 mm cannon were available for training. Early in 1915 the 2nd East Anglian Division (which was numbered 69th in August 1915) concentrated round Thetford, where it formed part of First Army in Central Force. The divisional artillery was distributed around Brandon, Cambridge and Tuddenham. In November the divisional artillery took over the 15-pounder guns released by its 1st Line (see above). The division's role throughout the war was to train drafts of reinforcements for units serving overseas. In May 1916, the 2/I East Anglian Brigade was numbered CCCXLV (345) Bde, the batteries became A, B and C, and it was joined by 2/1st Suffolk (Howitzer) Bty from 2/III East Anglian Brigade, which became D (H) Bty. The following month the division was transferred to Northern Command and moved to Harrogate in North Yorkshire. On 1 September 1916, C Bty changed places (and designations) with 533 (Howitzer) Battery, RFA, at Cowshott (near Aldershot). In November 1916, B Bty was broken up to bring A and C Btys up to six-gun strength. However, the following month the whole brigade was broken up, with A and D (H) Btys becoming B and D (H) Btys in CCCXLVIII (2/IV East Anglian) Bde and C Bty becoming B Bty in CCCXLVI (2/II East Anglian) Bde. =3/I East Anglian Brigade= A 3rd Line Depot brigade (3/I East Anglian Brigade) was formed early in March 1915. At first, training had to be carried out without any guns, harness or horses. In May the unit was affiliated to No 4 TF Artillery School at High Wycombe, which took over training while the 3/Ist became a holding a draft-finding unit. The 3rd Line East Anglian brigades were merged into the school in August 1916, when it became 4th Reserve Brigade, RFA (TF).Sainsbury, Hertfordshire Batteries, pp. 93‚Äì5. Interwar years =84th (1st East Anglian) Field Brigade= When the TF was reformed on 7 February 1920 the unit was reformed in 54th (East Anglian) Division as 1st East Anglian Brigade, RFA. On the reconstitution of the TF as the Territorial Army in 1921 it was numbered as 84th (East Anglian) Brigade, RFA,, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 522.Titles and Designations, 1927 * RHQ at The Barracks, Surrey Street, Norwich * 333rd (Norfolk) Field Bty at Norwich * 334th (Norfolk) Field Bty at Norwich * 335th (Norfolk) Field Bty at Nelson Road, Great Yarmouth * 336th (Northamptonshire) Field Bty (Howitzer) at 36 Queen's Road, Peterborough Queen Street drill hall at Drill Hall Project ‚Äì from the pre-war IV East Anglian (Howitzer) Bde When the RFA merged into the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1924, the unit changed its title to a 'Field Brigade, RA', and the subtitle '1st East Anglian' was restored in 1937. The brigade moved into new drill halls at All Saints Green, Norwich, Artillery Square, Great Yarmouth, and Lincoln Road, Peterborough. =78th (1st East Anglian) Anti-Aircraft Regiment= In 1938, the unit was one of a number of field artillery units selected for conversion to the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role as 78th (1st East Anglian) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (still termed a brigade until 1 January 1939). The process began in November 1938, when 336th (Northamptonshire) Bty joined 135th (East Anglian) (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Field Regiment, and was replaced by 409th (Suffolk) Independent AA Bty at Lowestoft.Frederick, pp. 756‚Äì9, 775.78 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45.135 Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. (The latter had originally been the 1st Suffolk AVC in the 1st Norfolk Administrative Bn, and later C (H) Bty of CCLXXII Bde, see above.) The new regiment therefore had the following composition: * RHQ at All Saints Green, Norwich * 243rd (2nd Norfolk) AA Bty at Norwich * 244th (3rd Norfolk) AA Bty at Norwich * 245th (1st Norfolk) AA Bty at Artillery Square, Great Yarmouth * 409th (Suffolk) AA Bty at Lowestoft The regiment was assigned to 41st (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 2nd AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II =Mobilisation= In February 1939 the TA's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations, which in the case of 41st (London) AA Bde was in East Anglia.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. =Phoney War= On the evening of Saturday 23 March 1940, a Royal Air Force bomber crashed in flames. Among the first on the scene were Sergeant H. Aspland and Gunners L. Thomas and H. Greenacre of 78th AA Rgt. In spite of the danger of explosion, Sgt Aspland and Gnr Thomas got one member of the crew out from under the wing just before the fuel tank exploded, while Gnr Greenacre carried the unconscious rear gunner to safety. The three men received a commendation from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of AA Command.Copy of commendation in Company Orders 1 May 1940, in 2nd (AASL) Company, Carmarthen Fortress RE War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew,file WO 166/3325. =Battle of Britain and Blitz= On 1 June 1940 the AA regiments equipped with 3-inch or newer 3.7-inch guns were redesignated 'Heavy AA' (HAA) regiments. During the Battle of Britain and Blitz, from July 1940 to February 1941, 2nd AA Division split 78th HAA Rgt up into detachments between 32nd (Midland), 40th and 41st (London) AA Bdes, covering airfields in East Anglia and the East Midlands, and 39th AA Bde covering the Humber Gun Zone.Farndale, Annex D.2 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.91 HAA Rgt Operation Orders in TNA file WO file 166/7462.

The regiment sent a cadre to 205th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, to provide the basis for a new 468 Bty; this was formed on 7 August 1941 and joined the regiment on 6 October 1941 to replace 409 Bty, which transferred to 136th HAA Rgt.

During April 1942 the regiment left AA Command (except 468 HAA Bty which joined 136 HAA Rgt, reducing 78th to the three-battery establishment for overseas service) and came under control of the War Office to prepare for overseas service.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional units), 2 April 1942 with amendments, TNA files WO 212/515. =Middle East= 3-inch AA guns on cruciform travelling carriages. 78th HAA Regiment left the UK in June 1942 with 243, 244 and 245 HAA Btys and sailed for the Middle East. The commander of Persia and Iraq Command (PAIFORCE), Gen Henry Maitland Wilson, had urgently requested additional AA units, to cover the vital oilfields and other facilities in case of Luftwaffe attack from the Caucasus,Routledge, p. 200. and the regiment joined Ninth Army in October.Joslen, p. 487.Routledge, p 198. In the event, the Germans did not break through in the Caucasus and the Luftwaffe was never able to bomb Iraq or Persia, which made the job of AA units in PAIFORCE rather dull. By January 1943, 78th HAA Rgt was part of 'AA Defence Area Levant' in 20th AA Bde, which covered Haifa, Beirut and Tripoli. The regiment's three batteries between then deployed 20 x 3.7-inch and 4 x 3-inch HAA guns.Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162, Table XXV, p. 164. In November 1943 the regiment moved to Egypt as part of Middle East Forces. 3.7-inch AA gun in action in Italy. =Italy= From January 1944 the regiment was in Italy.Joslen, p. 467. Here it came under the command of 8th AA Bde, which was defending airfields in the Brindisi area for Eighth Army. In July the brigade was relieved and moved across Italy to defend Civitavecchia and US airfields on the Tiber plain, then back across to Ancona.Routledge, p. 289.Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293. However, by this stage of the Italian Campaign the Luftwaffe was incapable of serious attacks, while the British ground forces were suffering a severe manpower shortage, so many AA units were deemed surplus to requirements and the personnel made available for drafting to other units. 78th HAA Regiment was withdrawn for disbandment in September, and was placed in suspended animation with 243, 244 and 245 HAA Btys on 26 December 1945. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the unit reformed at Great Yarmouth as 284th (1st East Anglian) (Mixed) HAA Rgt, the 'Mixed' now indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the regiment.Frederick, p. 1001.266‚Äì288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. (The regiment's previous number was taken when the regular 1st Searchlight Rgt reformed as 78th HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 958.76‚Äì80 Rts RA at British Army 1945 on.) Meanwhile, 409th (Suffolk) HAA Bty reformed as 660 HAA Rgt at Lowestoft, became Mixed in 1950 and was disbanded in 1955.Frederick, p. 1029.Litchfield, p. 220.638‚Äì667 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. Both regiments initially formed part of 66th AA Bde (the old 40th AA Bde), though that was disbanded the following year.Frederick, p. 1051.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. On 1 August 1950 the 284th HAA Rgt absorbed the 418th (Norfolk) (M) HAA Rgt (previously 514th (Suffolk) Coast Rgt, originally the Suffolk RGA).Frederick, p. 1010.Litchfield, p. 188. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, resulting in a large number of disbandments and mergers among TA AA units. The 284th HAA Rgt merged with the 389th (Norfolk Yeomanry) LAA Rgt to form 284th (The King's Royal Regiment, Norfolk Yeomanry) LAA Rgt, of which the old 284th formed RHQ and Q Btys, with HQ returning to Norwich. This regiment in turn later merged with 358th (Suffolk Yeomanry) Field Rgt, becoming 308th (Suffolk and Norfolk Yeomanry) Field Rgt, with HQ moving to Ipswich and ending the Norfolk Artillery Volunteers lineage.Frederick, pp.1004, 1007, 1009.Litchfield, p. 186.

Graven was created some time before year 1500 on and in the northernmost moat used to defend the early Viking settlement. It is one of the oldest streets in the city and used to mark the northern city limits along with Klostergade. Graven runs 220 meter west to east from Klostergade to Mejlgade and is situated in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood. Graven is fairly narrow and is a designated one-way street for motorized traffic in the direction of Mejlgade towards Klostergade. Graven is characterized by low housing, caf√©s and speciality shops, and has much foot and bicycle traffic. As Klostergade and Mejlgade, Graven is a shared bikeway, part of the city's bicycle infrastructure network.  Etymology  The earliest name of the street was \\"Gravene\\", meaning \\"the moats\\" or \\"the digs\\", referring to the previous moats around Aarhus, dug as part of the Viking town fortifications. The moats, the ramparts and the palisades were all dismantled, but carried over in some street names. The singular \\"Graven\\", which names the street today, is known from the late 1500s. The pronunciation of the name today still references the original plural name as the first syllable is pronounced with a long \\"a\\" as if it was the plural case.  History  The early Viking settlement was fortified by moats and ramparts to the north, west and south. During the Middle Age the city grew beyond the boundaries marked by these defenses and at the same time advancements in warfare had made them less useful in potential military conflicts. Some time before 1500, the ramparts and moats were dismantled and the street Graven was established on and in the northernmost moat. It is believed the moat was filled in using earth from an adjoining rampart. Graven became an extension of Klostergade which had previously been the northmost street in the city. In 1914, the city council hotly debated whether to lengthen Graven to newly built port facilities south of the city. The plan would entail demolishing Juuls Gaard and another property in Mejlgade. The later mayor Jakob Jensen argued against the plans as insufficient. In the end it was decided to wait for the Goods Station to be relocated to the west of the city and for the river to be paved over and the new street √Öboulevarden to be established. The changes proved sufficient and Graven kept its original medieval structure. Today, Graven is reminiscent of a typical European medieval street with low dense housing and a somewhat curved alignment. The majority of the buildings are from the 19th century interspersed with medieval half-timbered structures.  Buildings  Graven no. 21 was designed and built by architect Carl Lange in 1876 and commissioned by the city to house a social institution but since 1917 it was home to the municipal dental care facilities for public school.

Alcorn, also a U.S. Senator and former governor. Alcorn's estrangement from Ames, his northern-born colleague, deepened in 1871, as African-Americans became convinced that Alcorn was not taking the problem of white terrorism seriously enough; and, in fact, Alcorn resisted Federal action to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, contending that state authorities were sufficient to handle the task. By 1873 the quarrel had deepened into an intense animosity. Both men ran for governor. Ames was supported by the Radicals and most African Americans, while Alcorn won the votes of conservative whites and most of the scalawags. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490. Alcorn withdrew from active politics in the state, emerging to assail the new governor as incapable and an enemy of the people of Mississippi. =Results= References 1873 gubernatorial Mississippi November 1873 events ","title":"1873 Mississippi gubernatorial election"},{"id":"52557832","text":"Nadia Khiari in 2016 Nadia Khiari (; born 21 May 1973) is a Tunisian cartoonist, painter, graffiti artist and art teacher. She is best known for her chronicles and cartoon collections about the Arab Springs, particularly her character Willis the cat, dubbed the \\"Cat of the Revolution\\" in some sources. Academic background Academically, Khiari is a graduate of the Faculty of Plastic Arts in Aix-en-Provence, France, and teaches art at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Tunis. In 2013 she received the Docteur Honoris Causa from the University of Li√®ge. Arab Spring Khiari's work has been published in Sin√© Mensuel, Courrier International and Zelium. In criticism of the now- deposed leader, Ben Ali, she created a cartoon character, a cat named Willis, in January 2011, as an outlet on Facebook to air her feelings about the Arab Spring, and she now has over 41,000 followers. She confessed that she draws \\"to take the heat off certain situations\\". Due to the Ali regime's strict policies on criticism, to avoid being thrown into prison she was careful to \\"learn to trick, to suggest rather than to say\\". She has said of her artwork and the revolution: \\"For me it's not a job. It's a freedom. Like I'm being born. Before the revolution, I was a zombie. I think, but I cannot express myself. So I didn't feel like I was alive. With the revolution I was born, like a baby. My first screaming was my drawing. And now for me it's a revolution in my art, totally. I can finally express myself and say what I think and criticize the government. For me I can finally do my passion: cartoons.\\" Aside from her cartoons, Khiari is also known for her work as a graffiti artist. Acclaim Khiari has received significant acclaim for her artwork. She has been awarded the Honor√© Daumier Award during the Second International meeting of Cartooning for Peace in Caen (2012), the Political Satire International Award in Forte dei Marmi (2014), and the Agora Med Award for Intercultural Dialogue in the Mediterranean (2015).

Founded as a mission church in 1953, the church was granted parish status in 1955, and was incorporated in 1958. The church moved into its present structure in 1961. History Interior of the Quonset Hut The parish was founded as a mission church in 1953, with its first service being held on November 15, 1953. Initial services were held in various locations on private properties, until moved to a Quonset hut located at 132 W. Main Street in Scottsdale, which was consecrated on October 3, 1954. Paul L. West was named as the parish's first rector in 1954, and St. Barnabas held its first service on March 3, 1954, which was Ash Wednesday. By the end of 1954 the mission church was financially self-sufficient. On January 4, 1955, Mr. & Mrs. Fowler McCormick donated the land on Mockingbird Lane in Paradise Valley where the current structure is located, very close to the property they would later donate to the city of Scottsdale for the McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park. The ten acre parcel sat across the street from the Judson School. Pre-construction site Sanctuary under construction While continuing to conduct services in the Main Street location, the parish began raising funds for a permanent structure to be built on the donated property. Part of the Arizona Missionary Jurisdiction, the church was granted parish status by Bishop Arthur Barksdale Kinsolving II on November 1, 1955 (All Saints Day). On May 2, 1958, the church was officially incorporated in the state of Arizona. Later that year, the Missionary District officially became a Diocese of the Episcopal Church. In September 1959 Henry B. Getz became the rector of the parish. In 1959, the design and construction of the new church building was awarded to T.S. Montgomery. In September 1960 it was announced that the parish had accepted the conceptual drawings for the church complex to be built on their 10-acre parcel. The design included four buildings. A 460-seat main sanctuary, a 60-seat chapel, and offices would occupy the main building; a meeting hall with kitchen facilities would be a second building, with the remaining two buildings named Education Buildings A & B housing classroom and small meeting rooms. The estimated cost of construction was $456,950. Construction on the current sanctuary, along with the chapel, offices and education building B began in 1960, with the official ground breaking occurring on December 4. It was undertaken by the Redden Construction Company of Phoenix. Construction was completed the following year and the first service in the present sanctuary was held on September 11, 1961. On November 12, 1961 all the new buildings were dedicated. The sanctuary was \\"originally designed to have the acoustic properties of larger cathedrals\\". 1961 also saw the creation of the Church's \\"Memorial Acceptance and Fine Arts\\" committee (MAFA). Composed of between seven and nine congregation members with fine arts interests, the committee is responsible for approving all religious items, artwork, and decorations for the church. The first work commissioned and completed was a baptismal font, designed by Paradise Valley artists, Allen Ditson and Lee Porzio. When the church installed its new organ in 1962, the notable American organist, Richard Purvis, flew into Scottsdale to perform the dedication ceremony. The parish hall, now called Hutton Hall, was added to the church's campus in 1964, the fallowing year John H. Parke became rector. In November 1970, William Purdis Rowland was installed as the parish's new rector. In 1973, in honor of the congregation paying off the original mortgage, a mortgage burning ceremony was held. The church was consecrated, and blessed by several Episcopalian dignitaries, including George R. Selway, Robert Donohoe (the ecumenical director of the Episcopal Diocese of Arizona), and the former pastor of St. Barnabas, Henry B. Getz. The consecration took place because a church in the Episcopal faith may not be consecrated until it is debt-free (\\"all possibility of alienation to secular uses be erased\\"). The sanctuary received new main doors which involved a new art form invented by Ditson and Porzio, called \\"traforato\\". The doors are cut forms of steel depicting scenes of children in the Bible, as well as the different stages of childhood. The cut steel is encased in glass. Some of the scenes depicted include David and Goliath and Tobias. Also seen in the artwork include images of musical instruments, natural objects and animals. In addition to the doors, Ditson and Porzio created many other pieces of artwork for the church. Among these include a massive tapestry entitled, \\"Ode to Joy,\\" designed by Porzio; the main altar and cross, acolyte chairs, candelabra, and various basins and stands. 1976 saw the completion of the parish's memorial garden, located to the north of the main sanctuary; the garden had its first interment in February of that year. The second education building, the learning center, located to the east of the initial education structure and to the north of the memorial garden, was erected in 1988; the last of the three education buildings, named \\"Sean's Place\\", was built in 1999, located just to the east of the learning center. Sanctuary, opening week 1961 In 2006 the parish underwent a building expansion which saw the addition of a music center, a bookstore and lounge, and renovation of the existing parish hall. The music center includes a tower containing a 25-bell carillon, designed by Royal Eijsbouts. The carillon is the only carillon in the state of Arizona, and only one of approximately 200 in all of the United States. The bells were dedicated in a special concert on October 7, 2006. The set consists of 25 bells, weighing 4,074 pounds, and are played electronically every hour from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with occasional manual performances as well. The bells were dedicated to John S. Thornton and his wife, Jan. Thornton had served as Rector of the parish from 2002‚Äì2004. The sanctuary underwent a $4.5M renovation in 2010. The updates included replacing the 2,768-pipe organ dedicated in February 1962, as well the tapestry, \\"Ode to Joy,\\" which had been damaged over the year due to exposure to light. The organ was replaced by Casavant Fr√®res, the same company which had crafted the original organ, this time with 2,929 pipes.The organ was donated by John C. and Mary Dell Pritzlaff. Also during the renovation a new sound system was installed, to relieve ongoing acoustical issues. A unique feature was combining the organ's pipes with a mosaic, titled \\"Wondrous Love\\", which spans the back wall of the sanctuary, designed by renowned Canadian glass artist, Sarah Hall. St. Barnabas today Hutton Hall, constructed in 1964 St. Barnabas is one of the Arizona centers for Contemplative Outreach, for those interested in the practice of Centering Prayer as taught by Father Thomas Keating. Outside organizations are also allowed to use the church's facilities, including Alcoholics Anonymous. St. Barnabas' current Rector, Jim Clark, along with clergy colleagues, parishioners, and biblical scholars, has developed a specific type of small group Bible study, called \\"The Art of Engaging Holy Scripture\\" (TAEHS). The practice is meant to create \\"... a lively method of engaging the Scriptures through reading and study, conversational prayer and silent prayer, and group sharing.\\" The practice gives the participants a succinct Biblical and Ecclesiological framework to enhance their prayer life and bible study, both in group sessions and on their own. The church also has its own chapter of the Order of Saint Luke. Current campus Since the construction of the original sanctuary, chapel and education building, the campus has grown over the decades. Office space was built in between the sanctuary and chapel in 1961 as part of the original plan, and was expanded in 1984, and a state of the art music building was constructed across the courtyard from the sanctuary. The sanctuary's original design contains rhythmic columns and arches, a high ceiling and a raised circular altar. The church's carillon is housed in the building. North of the music building is another structure holding a bookstore and coffee shop. Hutton Hall (constructed 1964) lies still further to the north, which also contains the parish's kitchen. To the north of the sanctuary lie the Memorial Garden, with a Labyrinth just to its east. The most northerly buildings include the original education structure, which has now been joined by two more education/meeting buildings, which also house the parish's library. The rest of the campus contains gardens, walkways, parking lots and a children's playground. Covered walkways connect the various structures. The main sanctuary incorporates indirect lighting sources which \\"provide a visual depth to the contemplative space.\\" The campus contains several pieces of art. Until its removal to a climate controlled facility, a tapestry by Lee Porzio and Allen Ditson's, \\"Ode to Joy,\\" hung behind the altar. Hanging behind its counterpart in the chapel is a 15th-century oil painting by Francesco Zaganelli. Ditson created the main altar, based on the concept of the crown of thorns as the support for a ship, symbolizing the church. However, that design was not accepted by the church's fine arts committee, and so was modified to its current form. The current base is made of triangular pieces of flamed steel, symbolizing mind, heart, and spirit, the three aspects of mind. Man's constant striving to reach ever upward is symbolized by the stand's pyramid shape. Other items designed by either Porzio or Ditson include the main sanctuary cross, candelabras, the door to the chapel, and alms basins.

Created in 1957, the sculpture resides in front of O‚ÄôShaughnessy Hall on the campus of the University of Notre Dame as part of the Shaheen-Mestrovic Memorial, which was completed in 1985 by the Department of Landscape Architecture and Planning in the South Bend office of Cole Associates. The marble and bronze sculpture depicts the events in John 4, in which Jesus converses and evangelizes to a woman from Samaria, with whom the Jews would not normally associate. Eli J. Shaheen, a Notre Dame alum, was the donor for the project, which is owned by the university. The ‚ÄúWoman at the Well,‚Äù as it is often referred, is flanked by sculptures of the gospel writers Luke the Evangelist and John the Evangelist. Description Christ and the Samaritan Woman is a larger-than-life-size marble and bronze sculpture. Two bronze figures, Jesus and the Samaritan Woman, surround the marble well. The Christ figure looks upward, hand raised as if speaking. The woman holds a water jug and looks downcast. Me≈°troviƒá also completed a smaller-scale version of the same piece, composed of plaster. It measures 28 X 23 inches, and, at the date of print of the 1974 collection, is part of the Notre Dame Art Gallery collection, being a gift from Rev. Theodore Hesburgh. The piece itself has some visual wear, as the aging bronze has obtained a greenish tint over the years weathering snow, rain, and immense heat in the upper-midwestern South Bend. The sculpture underwent conservation work in 2019 by Kline Fine Art, LLC - Cedar Springs, Michigan. Biblical Reference Based on the events chronicled in the Gospel of John, Chapter 4, Christ meets a Samaritan woman at a well. He asks her for a drink, and the woman is surprised, because Jews and Samaritans do not normally associate with one another. Jesus then speaks of the living water, the water which will satisfy all thirst, and tells her that He is the Messiah. This story emphasizes unity amongst those of different backgrounds. Use The Shaheen-Mestrovic Memorial, and especially the ‚ÄúChrist and the Samaritan Woman‚Äù statue, is used for many purposes by students and faculty on campus. During the day, students sit around the memorial. Some student groups and residence halls hold prayer services, retreat activities, reflection time, or faith meetings by the statue. In November 2016, Father John I. Jenkins, President of the University of Notre Dame, held an interfaith prayer service for the campus community in front of the statue. Held in conjunction with Notre Dame Student Government, the service sought to ‚Äúsupport everyone affected by the recent election,‚Äù with an invitation to ‚Äújoin us for this service of compassion as we pray for peace and unity in our nation,‚Äù sent to all students. Artist Ivan Me≈°troviƒá was a Croatian sculptor (1883-1962). Throughout his life, he lived all throughout Europe, in Rome, Vienna, Belgrade and Zagreb, and traveled to many other European cities with his art collections. He was exiled for a time from his home in Yugoslavia for political reasons during World War I. He became an art professor, and often donated his work to the Catholic Church if they were not able to pay for it. During World War II, Mestrovic refused to cooperate with the ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù Croatian government set up by Adolf Hitler and the Axis powers. He was put in jail. When released, he and his family fled to Rome. No longer able to return to Croatia after the war, he accepted a professor position at Syracuse University in 1946. In 1955, Mestrovic moved to the University of Notre Dame to be the sculptor-in-residence and a ‚ÄúDistinguished Professor‚Äù, where then-president, Father Theodore Hesburgh, built him a studio. At Notre Dame, Mestrovic created many art pieces that reside on campus, and his influence is seen in pieces created by his students as well. As he said, ‚ÄúSculpture and art in general should contribute to human civilization, to human progress and mankind‚Äôs spiritual development.‚Äù As such, much of his work on Notre Dame's campus is faith-centered, including his famous replica of the Piet√† statue housed in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame.

It is located in the locality of Wannsee in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough. Close to Glienicke Bridge (known as Bridge of Spies) the park is open to the general public. The park is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin (Potsdam cultural ensemble). Within the ensemble it is one of the five main parks, the others being Sanssouci Park, New Garden (Neuer Garten), Babelsberg Park and Peacock Island (Pfaueninsel). Regarding diversity in gardening styles within the Potsdam park ensemble Park Glienicke is only superseded by Sanssouci Park. Furthermore, it is a park especially characterized by one personality due to the intense involvement of Prince Charles of Prussia. The park covers approximately Ulrich, Horst et.al.

The Encyclopedia of the Federal Capital], FAB Verlag, 1993, Berlin, p. 653 History In 1682 Frederick William of Brandenburg, the Great Elector, commissioned the first hunting lodge Jagdschloss Glienicke next to the uninhabited village Klein-Glienicke which suffered badly in the Thirty Years' War. The lodge had a garden with four carp ponds. South of the lodge was an enclosed wildlife park; north a tree garden and two vineyards.Schulthei√ü- Block, Gabriele (Ed.): ‚ÄúDas Gantze Eyland muss ein Paradies werden, Jagdschloss Glienicke: 300 Jahre in Ansichten, Pl√§nen, Portraits‚Äù [The Whole Island has to become a paradise, Hunting lodge Glienicke: 300 years by Views, Plans, Portraits], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Haus am Waldsee (de), Berlin, 20 June ‚Äì 9 August 1987 Already since 1660 the first wooden Glienicke Bridge linked the area to Potsdam. In 1715 under Frederick William, the Soldier King, the lodge became a military hospital for soldiers to be quarantined. In 1747 the hospital head Dr. Mirow bought the tree garden and the new vineyard which were neglected since the Soldier King's death and established there an estate where besides farming kilns for bricks and lime were operated. In 1758 the lodge itself was turned into a wallpaper factory which became an orphanage in 1827. From 1789 on the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee (de) was built distinctly separating former lodge and new estate. The Mirow estate had different owners until the Prussian lieutenant general and head equerry Count Carl von Lindenau (de) bought it in 1796Bergau, Rudolf: ‚ÄúInventar der Bau- und Kunstdenkm√§ler in der Provinz Brandenburg‚Äù[Inventory of Historic Monuments and Works of Art in the Province of Brandenburg], Voss Verlag, 1885, Berlin and converted it into an ornamented farm.Seiler, Michael: ‚ÄúDie Entwicklungsgeschichte des Landschaftsgartens Klein-Glienicke 1796‚Äì1883‚Äù[The evolution of the landscape garden Klein-Glienicke 1796‚Äì1883], Dissertation, 1986, Hamburg/ File:Klein-Glienicke Plan Suchodoletz.jpgMap of the first Hunting Lodge Glienicke, North to the right (Samuel de Suchodolec, 1683) File:Klein-Glienicke Jagdschloss und Br√ºcke Nagel 1788.jpgSecond wooden Glienicke Bridge and first Hunting Lodge Glienicke (Johann Friedrich Nagel, 1788) File:Klein-Glienicke 1796 Parkansicht.jpgView from vineyard (later site of Roman Bench) across estate towards Potsdam (Berger following L√ºdtke, 1796) File:Plan Glienicke 1805.jpgMap of Lindenau's Ornamental Farm, North to the right (J.

Lenn√©, 1816) After the Prussian Chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg had purchased the estate in 1814, he commissioned the Prussian gardener Peter Joseph Lenn√© to design a park in 1816. The first part was the pleasure ground inspired by English landscape gardening. In 1822 Germany's renowned landscape gardener Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau brought the English architect John Adey Repton(son of the great English landscape designer Humphry Repton) to Glienicke. After his return to England J.A. Repton designed a Hardenberg basket supposedly inspired by a wooden basket containing a bed of roses in Glienicke. Prince Charles tending trees in Park Glienicke, (H. L√ºdeke, around 1880) In November 1822 Chancellor Hardenberg died. In 1824 the estate was sold to Prince Charles of Prussia. It has remained a mystery why the unmarried third-born son of the Prussian king was the first son to get his own estate.Seiler, Michael ; Sperlich, Martin: ‚ÄúSchlo√ü und Park Glienicke‚Äù [Palace and Park Glienicke], Zehlendorfer Chronik[Chronicles of Zehlendorf], no. 6 (1987), Berlin While the mansion was converted into Glienicke Palace, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Prince Charles developed the park together with Lenn√© and other gardeners in the following decades to the extent which is still visible today. Being a particular anglophile he had the nickname ‚ÄûSir Charles Glienicke‚Äú within the Prussian royal family. Yet he never travelled to England as he was opposed to British politics like his anglophile sister Charlotte, the wife of Russian Emperor Nicholas I. Visiting his sister Prince Charles travelled several times to Saint Petersburg, where he was especially fascinated by Pavlovsk Park, which was designed as a classic English landscape garden. Park Glienicke was well known to the European aristocracy as the protocol for state visits to the Prussian capital required to pay also a visit to Prince Charles in Glienicke. On 14 August 1858 Queen Victoria and Prince Consort Albert visited Palace and Park Glienicke. Earlier that year their daughter Victoria had married Charles' nephew Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia. After the park had been officially called Prince's Charles of Prussia Park(Park des Prinzen Carl von Preu√üen) since 1824 it was renamed to Prince's Friedrich Leopold of Prussia Park(Park des Prinzen Friedrich Leopold von Preu√üen) in 1885. As Charles' son Friedrich Carl of Prussia survived him by only two years the grandson Friedrich Leopold inherited Palace and Park Glienicke. Despite the instruction in Charles' will that the heirs should spend each year 30,000 Mark on the park Friedrich Leopold neglected the park. When Germany became a republic in 1919 Palace and Park Glienicke remained part of the Prince's property. Palace and park suffered further neglect as Friedrich Leopold moved to Lugano in Switzerland and took several pieces of art with him to pay off his debts.Sternaux, Ludwig: ‚ÄúPotsdam ‚Äì Ein Buch der Erinnerung‚Äù [Potsdam ‚Äì A Book of Recollection], Edwin Runge Verlag, 1924, Berlin In 1924 the Prussian state bought the part of B√∂ttcherbergpark. A development plan of 1928 for that area was not carried out.Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù [Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987 Friedrich Leopold's intention to sell off the areas of the 1841 park extension was blocked by the Prussian state resulting in a lawsuit which ended with the Prince's death in 1931.Julier, J√ºrgen: ‚ÄúGlienicke im 20. Jahrhundert‚Äú[Glienicke in the 20th century], in: Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987 After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 the City of Berlin bought most of the park in 1934 and 1935. Julius Lippert, Reichskommissar of Berlin pressed the legal guardian of the heir(a minor) to sell and used the confiscated assets of the German bank manager and art collector Herbert M. Gutmann to pay. The Prince's family kept a triangular area in the southwest of the park including palace and pleasure ground. The park was opened to the public and named Volkspark Glienicke(People's Park Glienicke) indicating Lippert's populist intention. The official opening was on Adolf Hitler's birthday.von Krosigk, Klaus; Wiegand, Heinz: ‚ÄûGlienicke‚Äú, Berliner Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten[Berlin Sights] vol. 6, Verlag Haude und Spener, 1992, Berlin The following years the park suffered e.g. from the changes to the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee which became part of the Reichsstra√üe 1. After being appointed mayor of Berlin in 1937 Julius Lippert planned to have Glienicke as his official residence and let acquire the remaining part which was not owned by the city. In 1940 Lippert lost his office and the palace became a military hospital afterwards. Lithographic map of Park Glienicke after last extensions, around 1862 After World War II early ideas to convert the park into a huge West Berlin sports complex close to the border to the Soviet occupation zone were dropped. In 1952 the park became a nature reserve. Besides the restoration of Palace Glienicke and some other buildings by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and his students since the 1950s it took until 1969 for the park itself being regarded as a work of art by the West Berlin city administration. Since 1978 a special department for the conservation and restoration of historic gardens focused on Tiergarten and Park Glienicke. In 1981 the \\"Schinkel Year\\" provided further public funding and in 1982 the whole ensemble of Palace and Park was registered as historic monument and historic garden respectively. The Berlin Wall along the Berlin- Potsdam Chaussee on the one hand caused the demolition of some Swiss chalets in the part of the B√∂ttcherbergpark south of the chaussee, but on the other hand brought about the rebuilding of the chaussee to its original dimension. After the German reunification the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin were registered as UNESCO World Heritage Site on 1 January 1991. Since 1992 the park is part of the EU special protection area for wild birds \\"Western D√ºppel Forest\\" (Westlicher D√ºppeler Forst). In 2000 the Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg, formed in 1995, took over permanently the pleasure ground and the gardens near the palace. The rest of the park has remained with the Borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf. Garden areas around the Palace Pleasure ground, detail of map of 1862 Following the design guidelines by Humphry Repton for the classic English landscape garden Park Glienicke has the flower garden at the palace in the specific form of a garden courtyard. From 1816 on Lenn√© created the adjacent house garden, the pleasure ground, one of his early works and one of his masterpieces.B√∂rsch- Supan, Helmut: ‚ÄúDie Kunst in Brandenburg-Preu√üen. Ihre Geschichte von der Renaissance bis zum Biedermeier dargestellt am Kunstbesitz der Berliner Schl√∂sser.‚Äú [Art in Brandenburg-Prussia. Its history from Renaissance to Biedermeier described by the art owned by Berlin palaces.], Gebr. Mann Verlag, 1980, Berlin The pleasure ground has seemingly a natural landscape, yet Lenn√©'s whole design is artificial and artistic. The area was developed between palace, chaussee and bridge keeper's house. Lenn√© persuaded Hardenberg to buy a small farm estate, a so-called B√ºdnerei (de), on a flat terrain at the chaussee. The topography of the ‚ÄúB√ºdnerei‚Äù and of four terraces for growing fruit and wine(north of ‚ÄúB√ºdnerei‚Äù) vanished with the landscaping. =Flower beds = Elliptical and round flower beds with terracotta palmette borders are typical for garden courtyard and pleasure ground. The restoration was supported by discovering original border stones in the cellar of the Curiosity pavilion.Seiler, Michael: ‚ÄúNeue Untersuchungen zur urspr√ºnglichen Gestaltung und zur Wiederherstellung des Pleasuregrounds von Klein- Glienicke.‚Äù[New research on the original design and the restoration of the Pleasure Ground at Klein-Glienicke.] In: Heikamp, Detlef (Ed.): ‚ÄúSchl√∂sser, G√§rten, Berlin. Festschrift f√ºr Martin Sperlich zum 60. Geburtstag 1979‚Äù[Palaces, Gardens, Berlin. Festschrift on Martin Sperlich‚Äòs 60th birthday in 1979], Ernst Wasmuth Verlag, 1980, T√ºbingen, pp. 121‚Äì128 In the underground the beds are walled in allowing for specific irrigation, therefore the pleasure ground has been crisscrossed with water pipes. As the clay pipes on Peacock Island lasted only ten years after being installed in 1824 expensive iron pipes supplied by the Prussian industrial pioneer F.A. Egells (de) were installed in Glienicke when in 1838 the pumping station started operating with a steam engine, a gift by Charles‚Äô father which was also manufactured by F.A. Egells. The beds were filled with a loose subsoil which facilitated the quick replacement of plants. There are some figurative designed beds bordered with buxus which add to the pleasure ground an artificial aspect, e.g. the Oak Leaf bed near the Lions Fountain and the Diana(Greek:Artemis) or Pliny bed at the Casino. An Athena statue, which is now at the British Museum, stood in a niche on the northside of the Casino characterizing it as a place of art. Most striking is the Lilies bed beneath Charles' bedroom windows at the western facade of the palace. It is a heraldic sign referring to Charles' younger sister Louise who was married to Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. She was very supportive sending bulbs to Charles. In Glienicke planting of roses has been almost non-existent in contrast to Babelsberg Park and Peacock Island. The pleasure ground in Glienicke is rather a portrayal of an antique villa complex as described by Pliny the Younger than a reflexion on a longing for Italy(Italiensehnsucht).

The pleasure ground itself has several architectural elements: =Lions Fountain= The planning for a big new fountain started after the construction of the pumping station began in 1836. On 23 October 1837 Prince Charles, Schinkel, Persius and Lenn√© met in Glienicke to discuss the fountain near the greenhouse which Count von Lindenau commissioned at the end of the 18th century. Schinkel drafted the fountain and a new greenhouse which never got beyond the design stage as on its site Persius build the Stibadium in 1840. The Lions Fountain has two gilded cast-iron sculptures of Medici lions which were a present by Charlotte to her brother Charles on his 30th birthday in 1831.Julier, J√ºrgen: ‚ÄúParkgeb√§ude nach Entwurf Schinkels ‚Äú[Park buildings designed by Schinkel], in: Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987 The lions were placed on two high, zinc cast pedestals, which flank the fountain, each resting on four zinc cast Doric columns concealing the iron supporting structure. Charlotte and her husband, the Russian Emperor, were present at the official opening of the fountain on 2 June 1838. On the balustrade at the rear of the fountain, which is divided by the flight of steps from the palace, were placed four allegorical terracotta statues (created around 1855) describing both commerce, science, art and military as the cornerstones of the state and the four seasons.Sievers, Johannes: ‚ÄúBauten f√ºr den Prinzen Carl von Preu√üen (Karl Friedrich Schinkel Lebenswerk)‚Äú[Buildings for Prince Charles of Prussia (Karl Friedrich Schinkel‚Äôs lifework)], Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1942, Berlin The creator of the statues was probably Christian Daniel Rauch's student Alexander Gilli (de) who was ‚Äúcourt sculptor‚Äù in Glienicke. Through the years the jet of water changed. At first a simple jet of water was projected vertically from a triton statue. Later that changed to aigrette and bell shapes. Also the Lions sculptures spouted water. The Lions Fountain has become a symbol for Park Glienicke. The view from the chaussee to the fountain with the palace in the background was the most common subject of the numerous vedute of Park Glienicke. After World War II the whole fountain was in a ruinous state. During the restoration from 1960 to 1964 most of the parts above ground had to be renewed. Fifty years later the fountain had again serious construction defects. After the fall of a tree on the fountain the restoration could not be delayed anymore. As in 2009 the work started more defects were discovered and investigated. Financed by considerable private donations the restoration was completed in August 2010. =Curiosity Pavilion= Curiosity Pavilion, view from garden The pavilion named Curiosity dates back to 1796 and was rebuilt in strict Doric order by Schinkel in 1825. It has a cellar. Its name derives from the fact that it could be used to watch the traffic on the adjacent Berlin- Potsdam chaussee through the shutters while being invisible to passers-by. Around 1848 the pavilion became a place for arts collection. Spolia were inserted in the entrance hall. At the same time a Florentine Renaissance arcade was installed as a cover on the garden fa√ßade. Already in 1842 the arcade was bought from the Russian arts collector Anatoly Demidov who lived in Florence. = Stibadium = The Stibadium was designed by Friedrich Ludwig Persius and built on the site of a neoclassical greenhouse with a garden room(built after 1796) in 1840.Eggeling, Tilo: ‚ÄúLudwig Persius als Architekt in Glienicke.‚Äù[Ludwig Persius as architect in Glienicke.] In: Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù [Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987 The semi-circular Tholos structure with a wooden half-cone roof was the main place for having tea. On the underside of the roof a twelve deities programme is painted. As there are 14 fields the Twelve Olympians were supplemented with Bacchus and Amphitrite. The middle pillar had originally a zinc-cast Kore designed by August Kiss which later was replaced with a marble copy of the Felicitas Publica in the monument Max-Joseph Denkmal by Christian Daniel Rauch in Munich.Fontaine, Susanne: ‚ÄúStibadium in Glienicke‚Äù. In: Stiftung Preu√üische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin-Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg](Ed.): ‚Äúludwig persius architekt des k√∂nigs ‚Äì baukunst unter friedrich wilhelm IV.‚Äù[ludwig persius, the king‚Äôs architect ‚Äì architecture for Frederick William IV], Verlag Schnell und Steiner, 2003, Regensburg, pp. 189-190 On the terrace stands a granite bowl by Christian Gottlieb Cantian which Charles inherited after his father died in 1840. The Stibadium had the function to be a shield between pleasure ground and Drive. It had also the opposite purpose of the Curiosity pavilion. While looking on the common people from such an elevated and prestigious building the Prince's tea party was on show to the people at the same time. The paintings of the Twelve Olympians may seem presumptuous, yet they are an artistic expression of how Prussian aristocrats saw themselves in the age of European Restoration. =Rotunda= After Glienicke Bridge was rebuilt in stone in 1834 Prince Charles asked for a round summerhouse at the new corner of the garden. Based on ancient examples Schinkel designed a Rotunda in which the first tea party took place on 2 July 1835. At Prince Charles‚Äô instigation the pavilion was crowned with the reproduction of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The completed rotunda was opened with a big party on 16 August 1837. Rotunda, stone bridge and the residence Villa Sch√∂ningen on the opposite bank of the river Havel formed a little architectural ensemble on its own. This was destroyed when the stone bridge was replaced by the steel bridge in 1907. In 1935 the Rotunda was moved furthermore when the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee was expanded and became part of the Reichsstra√üe 1.

X. Sandmann, 1845) North of the Rotunda at the shore of Jungfernsee lies the two-storey Casino from 1824. Its terrace, overlooking the lake, was the most beautiful place for having tea. It was the first building Schinkel designed for Prince Charles. On the one hand its name refers to a one-storey building previously used to play billiards in it, which Schinkel redesigned; on the other hand there is the Italian origin of the word \\"Casino\\" and that the building resembles country houses at the Gulf of Naples. In autumn and winter 1822/23 Charles had accompanied his father and his brother William on a four and a half month journey to Italy, where they spent four weeks in the Naples region visiting the excavation sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii. =Dummy Frigate= Just north of the Casino was a dummy frigate, designed by Schinkel, on an artificial peninsula which presumably was thrown up as a bank of earth only in the 18th century serving as wharf for the ships transporting bricks and limestone. After the kilns were closed down in 1824 the peninsula became a mooring and was included in the garden design. The wooden construction of the frigate with three tall masts was used as a toolshed for the sailors who operated the Prince's miniature fleet. The dummy frigate was singular in the German landscape architecture. Presumably the Prince was inspired to having such a construction by travelling as a 13-year- old aboard the miniature frigate (first Royal Luise) which in 1814 the Prussian King Frederick William III received as present from the British King George III, a coalition partner in the Napoleonic Wars.Leiste, Susanne: ‚ÄúGlienicke in Ansichten des 19.

The buildings were erected to the west of the coach house at the edge of the pleasure ground where three little greenhouses stood previously. The arcade of the orangery referred to the adjacent coach house. The greenhouses, flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern gable end of the orangery.Schulze, Margrit-Christine: ‚Äú Orangerie und Treibh√§user im Park Glienicke ‚Äù[Orangery and Greenhouses in Park Glienicke], In: Stiftung Preu√üische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin-Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg](Ed.): ‚Äúludwig persius architekt des k√∂nigs ‚Äì baukunst unter friedrich wilhelm IV.‚Äù[ludwig persius, the king‚Äôs architect ‚Äì architecture for Frederick William IV], Verlag Schnell und Steiner, 2003, Regensburg, pp. 208‚Äì210 Figs, peaches, pineapple, prunes and strawberries were grown in the greenhouses. The area in front of the greenhouses was used for extensive seedbeds. Orangery and one part of the greenhouses were demolished in 1940 and reconstructed in 1981. = Cloister Courtyard = Cloister Courtyard, painting on vase, 1854 In 1850 the Cloister Courtyard between Casino and the greenhouses was erected as the last building on the pleasure ground. The formal reason for the building was to house Charles' extensive collections of medieval art and Byzantine sculptures. Historic building parts were purchased in Venice to be used as spolia in the Cloister Courtyard where Charles developed the first collection of Byzantine works of art in modern Europe.Zuchold, Gerd H.: ‚ÄúByzanz in Berlin. Der Klosterhof im Schlo√üpark Glienicke ‚Äù [The Byzantine Empire in Berlin. The Cloister Courtyard in the Park of Glienicke Palace], Berliner Forum[Berlin Forum], no. 6 (1984), Berlin, p. 54 The building has been described as a political statement by Prince Charles in the aftermath of the revolution of 1848. It is regarded as a tribute to the Byzantine Empire as a God-given unity of throne and altar in the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages. Furthermore, it is seen as a hidden tribute to Russia and its political order as the Russian emperors saw themselves as successors of the Byzantine Emperors.Zuchold, Gerd. H.: ‚Äú Der Klosterhof im Park von Schloss Glienicke in Berlin‚Äù [The Cloister Courtyard in the Park of Glienicke Palace in Berlin], Die Bauwerke und Kunstdenkm√§ler von Berlin [The historical buildings and works of art of Berlin], supplement 20/21, Gebr. Mann Verlag, 1993, Berlin The Cloister Courtyard represents an unusual mixture of a romantic architecture depicting the contemporary atmosphere and of the function as a museum, so to speak a very late Hermitage with scientific pretension and political statement. Part of the collection in the Cloister Courtyard was the Imperial Throne of Goslar which Charles acquired with the help of his former tutor Heinrich Menu von Minutoli who had fostered Charles‚Äô interest in antiquities.Sch√ºtte, Margret: ‚ÄúPrinz Friedrich Carl Alexander von Preu√üen (Biografische Skizze ).‚Äú[Prince Frederick Charles Alexander of Prussia (Biographical Sketch).], in: Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987, pp. 191-210 The throne was kept together with other medieval treasures in a chapel-like vault. In 1871 Charles loaned the throne to his brother Emperor William I to be used as the Emperor's seat in the imperial ceremony opening the first Berlin Reichstag. Charles left the throne in his will to the town of Goslar. The most precious relief on the walls of the Cloister Courtyard was a late 12th century tondo of the Byzantine Emperor. Nowadays only a reproduction is on display. The original is part of the Byzantine Collection of the Dumbarton Oaks Museum in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.. =Coach House Courtyard and Palace Tower= The Coach House Courtyard dates from 1828 (design by Schinkel) and housed Charles' collection of coaches. The four arches refer to the Roman Agoranomion in Athens which Schinkel and his contemporaries thought of as the most important arch architecture of the \\"Old Greeks\\". The Palace Tower adjacent to the coach house was built in 1832 and was used as a difficult to climb vantage point. Charles called the tower the ‚ÄúGood Charles‚Äù(Guter Carl). In 1874 a late neoclassical observation loggia was put on the tower and the coach house was expanded including a second storey which was removed after World War II.Bernhard, Andreas: ‚ÄúDie Baut√§tigkeiten der Architekten v.

Due to its great weight it was probably kept at outdoor places for the tea parties during the summer season which lasted from 1 May(day of purchase of Glienicke) until 3 November (Hubertus's hunt). Some of the garden furniture was probably designed by Schinkel,Sievers, Johannes: ‚ÄúDie M√∂bel (Karl Friedrich Schinkel Lebenswerk)‚Äú[The Furniture (Karl Friedrich Schinkel‚Äôs lifework], Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1950, Berlin, pp. 24-25 other parts were in Louis Quinze style or Empire style. Wrought iron benches were presumably placed at smaller vantage points like e.g. the Lilac Pergola on the Lenn√© hill(as it is called nowadays) or the Lime Trees Pergola. The Lime Trees Pergola is the only non-architectural pergola in Glienicke which is still visible today. It consists of eight lime trees at a junction near the Cloister Courtyard which are the remains of the late 18th century geometrical aligned avenue trees. Near Lions Fountain and Stibadium the ‚ÄúSphingentreppe‚Äù, a low rise flight of steps, is covered with a trellis designed by Persius. The flight of steps is named after the Sphinx statues placed at the foot of the steps which like the ill-fitting steps are from the demolished neoclassical greenhouse with a garden room at the site of today's Stibadium. =Smaller Architectural Elements= There are some smaller architectural elements on the pleasure ground. Near the Lions Fountain a mosaic floor marks a former place for tea parties under the former King's Lime Tree which was one of the most impressive solitary trees on the estate. In front of the Curiosity pavilion is the ‚ÄúLa Laiti√®re‚Äú Fountain. It is an erratic crowned with a milkmaid bronze sculpture. The sculpture was a gift to Charles by his sister Charlotte in 1827. It was a copy of the original sculpture by Russian sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835) on the pleasure ground at the palace of Tsarskoye Selo. The sculpture refers to the fable about the milkmaid and her pail by Jean de La Fontaine. Today's copy was created in the Soviet Union in 1987.Seiler, Michael: ‚ÄúEntstehung des Landschaftsgartens Klein-Glienicke.‚Äú[The evolution of the landscape garden Klein-Glienicke.], in: Julier, J√ºrgen et. al.(Ed.) : ‚ÄúSchloss Glienicke: Bewohner, K√ºnstler, Parklandschaft‚Äù[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 1 August ‚Äì 1 November 1987 The Boy's Fountain is located in the middle of the pleasure ground. At its place was at first a sentimental memorial fountain called the ‚ÄúMonument‚Äú. Only after 1851 it was rebuilt into today's Boy's Fountain. It was inspired by a fountain design draft by Friedrich August St√ºler published in 1850 on which the (destroyed) Frog's Fountain in Sanssouci was modelled. For the Frog's Fountain Friedrich Wilhelm Dankberg (de) created a statue of a boy carrying a bowl from which Prince Charles commissioned a zinc copy. On Lenn√© hill half hidden at bushes a ‚Äûremnants of columns arrangement‚Äù is placed. The arrangement includes two column sections of the ancient Greek temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, a capital from the Pantheon in Rome and another one from the St. Paul's outside the Walls basilica in Rome.

In the middle of today's park lies the part of the Big Meadows(Gro√üer Wiesengrund). In the west of it the part of the Shore Ridge Path(Ufer-H√∂henweg) is located which is continued to the north by the part of the Hunter's Court (J√§gerhof). In the northeast the part of the Karpathen is a mountain park with steep slopes. South of it and east of the Big Meadows stretches a part which is dominated by Wooded Valleys(Waldt√§ler-Partie). South of the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee are the B√∂ttcherberg-Park with its Swiss chalets area and the adjacent Hunting Lodge Garden(Jagdschlossgarten). The east of the Hunter's Court and the wooded valleys became part of the park when Frederick William, who became King of Prussia in June 1840, gave the area on the basis of a kind of perpetual usufruct to his brother Charles as a Christmas present in 1840. The B√∂ttcherberg-Park belonged already to the Lindenau estate since 1804, yet the main landscape design effort started only in 1841. The largest part of the Karpathen was bought in 1851. Charles‚Äô work on the plans for the Hunting Lodge Garden started about the time when his brother, the King, suffered several strokes in summer 1857. The Swiss chalets in B√∂ttcherberg-Park were built from 1863 to 1867. after the owner of the adjacent Babelsberg Park, Charles‚Äô brother William, the Prince regent, became King in 1861. Some of the names of the parts are historical. Big Meadows, Shore Ridge Path, the part of the Hunter's Court and the part of the Wooded Valleys are auxiliary names as the traditional names by Charles and his family are not known. Map of Park Glienicke, Detail without park extensions, (P. J. Lenn√©, 1831) Lenn√©'s park design is characterized by very many and seemingly surprising sightlines in the park itself as well as in the Potsdam cultural ensemble. The continuous interlocking of meadows creating the highest degree of views is also typical for Lenn√©. Figurative flower beds, lively structured ponds and mountainous designed park parts are typical for landscape gardening by Prince P√ºckler. In Glienicke Prince Charles united both approaches, yet the western parts of the park show clearly the hand of Lenn√©. Regarding the park design Charles did not meet P√ºckler in person for decades, although they were introduced at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. Yet it is remarkable that Charles used the presence of P√ºckler's employee Jacob Rehder (de) at Babelsberg to consult him about P√ºckler's approach to landscape design while P√ºckler travelled through the north of Africa and the Near East from 1834 to 1840. Around 1837/38 Charles deviated from Lenn√©'s design principles when he designed three ‚Äùgorges‚Äù in the part of the Shore Ridge Path and started to subdivide Lenn√©'s unified designed park into parts. P√ºckler started the first of his eight visits to Prince Charles in Glienicke only in 1853, the same year the court gardener Friedrich Schojan, who had already served Hardenberg, retired. Schojan was succeeded by August Gieseler who previously worked at Muskau Park.Wimmer, Clemens Alexander: ‚ÄúVerzeichnis der Hofg√§rtner und leitenden Beamten der preu√üischen Gartenverwaltung bis 1945‚Äú[Index of court gardeners and senior officials of the Prussian administration of gardens until 1945], p. 311, in: Stiftung Preu√üische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin- Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin- Brandenburg](Ed.): ‚ÄúPreu√üisch Gr√ºn: Hofg√§rtner in Brandenburg- Preu√üen‚Äú[Prussian Green: Court Gardeners in Brandenburg-Prussia], accompanying book to the exhibition ‚ÄúPreu√üisch Gr√ºn. Vom k√∂niglichen Hofg√§rtner zum Gartendenkmalpfleger‚Äú[Prussian Green. From Royal Court Gardener to Curator of Historic Gardens] at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 18 July - 17 October 2004, Henschel Verlag, 2004, Leipzig, pp. 302‚Äì339 1824 was a busy year for Charles in Glienicke. Besides the architectural work with Schinkel and Persius he worked with Lenn√© and Schojan regarding the park design and ordered as much coppice as possible for planting in autumn and spring. For the first phase the planting of around 26,000 copses was recorded, mostly oaks, poplars, locust trees and lilac trees. The huge number of copses resulted in a big logistical effort. On the park terrain of that time planting on a massive scale of between 40,000 and 50.000 copses happened during the first years. Despite consisting mostly of young beeches procurement did get difficult. As neighbouring tree nurseries and forests ran fast out of copses sourcing took Lenn√©, who was in charge, to more distant regions, especially the state forest L√ºdersdorf in the Uckermark. At more exposed places in the park up to 40-years old trees were planted at huge costs during the following years. Sketch of Drive and park road network Through a network of park roads and footpaths most of the park was accessible. Pure footpaths were to be found in difficult terrain. At very steep slopes footpaths with steps were available which were lost when most of the park became ‚ÄúVolkspark‚Äù. One path with steps was across the Karpathen, another one linked the main park road, the Drive, with the Big Hunting Parasol. There were also paths with steps to reach the lower parts of the Alders Bridge in the part of the Shore Ridge Path. Touring Park Glienicke by coach was done on the Drive, the main park road, which began at the Middle Gate, nowadays an inconspicuous flight of stairs at the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee(K√∂nigstra√üe). When the chaussee was expanded to become Reichsstra√üe 1 the street level was raised at the park. Middle Gate was not anymore at the level of the Big Meadows requiring a flight of stairs. To access the ‚ÄúVolkspark‚Äù a monumental limestone flight of stairs was probably built in 1935 which was replaced by a more modest construction after 1945. In the 19th century visitors drove through Middle Gate, then past the big erratic with the date 1 May 1824(date of purchase of estate by Prince Charles) and along Big Meadows where the Palace Pond and the Workers‚Äô Quarters were on sight to finally reach the open part of the Garden Courtyard where they entered the Palace. From the Palace the Drive, allowing a view of Coach House Courtyard, went north along Shore Ridge with the Tent as highest vantage point. Close to Hunter's Court after a rather sharp bend the park road went south to the Big Meadows during the first years. Only at the end of the 1830s the completion of the three ‚Äúgorges‚Äù with the pertinent bridges on Shore Ridge and buildings like the Court Gardener's House with the adjacent water tower of the pumping station increased significantly the number of sights inside the park along the sightlines from the Drive. With the park extensions after 1840 the Drive was also extended to include the new parts in the north and the east. Several times the curve in the north was redesigned to a larger radius enabling a new route in the north which offered e.g. a splendid view of Peacock Island from the Drive. In its design the main park road became more dramatic in the east. From a dam leading southeastward views were possible into ‚Äúgorges‚Äù adorned with erratics. Passing the Hermitage the Drive descended into the wooded parts from where in a big westward curve it ascended to the edge of a steep slope which was impressive regarding the usual regional topography. From vantage points there magnificent long distance views on the Potsdam cultural ensemble were possible. At the Upper Gate the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee was crossed and the tour continued into B√∂ttcherberg-Park. Following another steep ascent the Alexandra Bench offered a view into the gorge there. At the Rondell the tour would usually be continued to the adjacent Babelsberg Park. On a shorter tour the coach would drive from the Rondell via the Middle Gate back to the Palace. The park roads were built in layers. Coarse material was covered with fine material. The camber ensured that rain ran fast off the surface.Dreger, Hans- Joachim Dreger: ‚ÄúGartendenkmalpflege in Brandenburg‚Äú [Preservation of Historic Gardens in Brandenburg], in: ‚ÄúLandesdenkmalamt Berlin und Brandenburgisches Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege und Arch√§ologisches Landesmuseum‚Äú[Department of Heritage, State Berlin and Department of Heritage Preservation and Archaeological Museum, State Brandenburg] (Ed.): ‚ÄúGartenkunst und Gartendenkmalpflege‚Äú [Garden Design and Preservation of Historic Gardens], ‚ÄúDenkmalpflege in Berlin und Brandenburg‚Äú[ Heritage Preservation in Berlin und Brandenburg], ‚ÄúArbeitshefte‚Äú[working papers], no. 2 (2004), Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg, p. 25 At slopes the park roads had narrow and flat gutters which were flanked by pebbles of erratics preventing erosion.

With up to 75 cm high stems, it is the smallest of the species of Scolymus. Its stems are lined with uninterrupted spiny wings. It also has the largest flowerheads in the genus, of approximately 5 cm wide. It has yellow, sometimes yolk-yellow ligulate florets. Its vernacular name in Maltese is xewk isfar kbir, meaning \\"large yellow fin\\", cardogna maggiore in Italian, scoddi on Sicily, and scolyme √† grandes fleurs in French.  Description  Scolymus grandiflorus is a spiny herbaceous annual or biennial of up to ¬æ m high, that contains a milky latex. It has twenty chromosomes (2n=20). = Root, stem and leaves = The stems carry uninterrupted spiny wings along their lengths. The rosette leaves are usually 10-16, exceptionally up to 24 cm long and ovate to oblong in shape, pinnately incised, with a wavy, spiny and dentate margin. The leaves on the stem are alternately set and are smaller but comparable to the rosette leaves. = Inflorescence, flowers and fruits = detail of a flowerhead The flowerheads are seated at the end of the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, and are arranged in a spike, which are subtended by two or three leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an involucre that consists of many spine-tipped bracts of usually between 9 and 15 mm long, in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency and have a white papery margin. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is mostly 13‚Äì18 mm in diameter conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a palea, the outer rows higher than the inner ones. There are three to seven pappus bristles on top of the cypselas in the centre, three to five with bordering the involucre. The yellow to yolk-yellow, strap-like corolla is usually 25‚Äì37 mm long, ends in five teeth, and does not carry black hair. Flowers are present from May to July. = Characters common to all Asteraceae = Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers that are fused together forming a tube through which the style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an indehiscent fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre. = Characters common to Cichorieae = Golden thistles are assigned to the Cichorieae tribe that shares anastomosing latex canals in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Scolymus these are ligulate florets, common to the group except for Warionia and Gundelia, which only have disk florets. A unique character setting Scolymus apart from the other Cichorieae are the dorsally compressed cypsellas which are surrounded by scales (or paleae). = Differences with other Scolymus species = S. grandiflorus is an annual or biennial of up to ¬æ m high with one, two or three leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerheads and these are spiny dentate. The yellow to orange florets do not have black hairs. The cypselas are topped by three to seven bristles of smooth pappus hairs (and are encased by the paleae). The spined wings along the stems are uninterrupted. S. maculatus is an annual of up to 1¬Ω m high, there are more than five leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerhead, and these bracts are pinnately divided. The yellow florets carry some black hairs. The cypselas do not have pappus at their top (but are encased by the paleae). The spined wings along the stems are uninterrupted. Leaves have a whitish vein along their margin. S. hispanicus is an annual, biennial or perennial of up to 1¬æ m high and it also has one, two or three spiny dentate leaflike bracts subtending each cluster of flowerheads and the yellow, orange or white florets also lack black hairs. The cypselas however are topped by two to five bristles of scabrous pappus hairs (and are encased by the paleae). In this species the spined wings along the stems are interrupted. This species can at first sight be confused with Carthamus species, such as C. lanatus, which is a true thistle with yellow disk florets, and although prickles are present on the stems, spiny wings are absent.  Taxonomy  In 1601, Carolus Clusius described this species for the first time, naming it Scolymus Dioscor. Castos Theophrasti. This name originates from before the start of the Linnean nomenclature and is therefore invalid. The correct name was given by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1799. In 1825 Henri Cassini described Myscolus megacephalus, but this is regarded a synonym.  Distribution  The species is most widely present in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Libya, and on Sicily. It further occurs in Lebanon, Turkey, Italy (Sicily, Sardinia, Lombardia, Tuscany, Basilicata, Calabria, Puglia and Abruzzo), and in France (the coast of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, the departement Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne and on southern Corsica), but has a patchy distribution in these parts.

The cycle was presented at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1978. Her artistic persona on this release has been described as \\"a Linda Ronstadt for the avant garde\\". She would collaborate again with Rosenboom (and percussionist William Winant) in 1979-80 on the song cycle Daytime Viewing (released 1983), which uses the framework of soap operas to deal with themes of commercialism, family, fashion, and abuse. She enjoyed a longstanding working relationship with the avant-garde opera composer Robert Ashley.  Discography  * Robert Ashley - Atalanta Acts of God 2, Lovely Music, Ltd.

It is a dense, compact shrub with wiry branches, three-part leaves and small, cream to pale pink flowers with four petals and four stamens. Description Zieria actites is a dense, compact shrub which grows to a height of and has erect, wiry branches. The leaves have three parts, resembling clover leaves and have a smell like aniseed. The central leaflet is long, wide with the other two leaflets slightly smaller. The leaflets have a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface and transparent oil glands. The leaf stalk is long. The flowers are cream to pale pink and are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and twenty on a stalk long. The four petals are narrow elliptical in shape, about long and hairy near their edges and the four stamens are less than long. Flowering mainly occurs from September to May and is followed by fruit which is a glabrous capsule, about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Zieria actites was first formally described in 1941 by Marco Duretto and Paul Forster from a specimen collected on Mount Larcom, north-west of Yarwun and the description was published in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (actites) is said to be derived from the Greek word actites, meaning \\"watcher\\", referring to the fact that the Pacific ocean can be seen from the mountain tops where this species occurs. In Ancient Greek, aktitƒìs (·ºÄŒ∫œÑŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ) is however the word for \\"dweller on the coast\\".Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Distribution and habitat This zieria grows in open woodland in crevices on rocky cliffs and outcrops on Mount Larcom, higher than about above sea leavel. Conservation This zieria is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992.

Early life  Brouk grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. The name \\"Brouk\\" is an alternative spelling of the Dutch name \\"Broek\\", a cognate with the English word \\"brook\\". She received a B.A. in Creative Writing and Electronic Music from the University of California, Berkeley. Inspired by the cadences of poetry and the human voice, as well as the rhythms and soundings of nature, she began creating music. She went on to receive an M.A. in Electronic Music from Mills College. While at Mills, Brouk studied under Robert Ashley and Terry Riley.  Career  After graduating, she went into radio production, and composed music for documentaries and other programs. Brouk self-released a number of recordings on cassette via her own label, Hummingbird Productions. Brouk's first release, Healing Music, featured the flute of American composer Maggi Payne. Her 1981 recording, Sounds of the Sea, included field recordings of nature sounds, vocals, and manipulated electronic and acoustic instruments. Brouk's music was known in New Age Music circles but did not receive a great deal of mainstream recognition. In 2016, a collection of archival recordings and selections from cassette releases, Hearing Music, was released by The Numero Group.  Personal life  In 1985, Brouk stopped composing and recording music after moving to San Diego, California, where she married and gave birth to a son, and took up the practice of transcendental meditation. Under the name Joanne (with an \\"e\\") Brouk, she became a prolific writer of historical fiction and plays, as well as a notable producer of Internet content. She died on April 28, 2017, at the age of 68.

Plot In their first adventure, Dreadly has a map that shows the location of buried treasure on Bing Bong Island, and he drags Moop along to help him find it. Of course, the villainous pirate Captain James Trench wants the treasure too and sends his bumbling henchmen to dig it up first. Synopsis The game begins with Moop reading a book on an island before his friend captain Dreadly interrupts by picking him up on his ship and telling him about a piece of a map to the treasure of Bing Bong island which he has found. The two then make there way to Bing Bong island by crash landing their boat onto the island. Its here where they meet chief Earwig who, after a trial, gives them the other half of the map. Moop and Captain Dreadly venture forth to find the treasure. After searching they see the pirate Captain James Trench who is also after the treasure. Moop and Dreadly find the treasure and the Chief's daughter, Princess Connie before being captured by Captain Trench. The three escape with the treasure and are chased before dropping the treasure into a volcano. Captain dread, Princess Connie , Moop and Captain Dreadly all make attempts to get the treasure from a rock in the middle of the volcano. The rest of the islands residents turn up and warn them the volcano is about to erupt before helping them get the treasure and escaping. The volcano erupts and Captain Dread is assumed to have escaped as well although not seen again. The game then has two endings, the first is to leave the island with the Golden Glockenspiel (the treasure) or to give it to Chief Earwig and Princess Connie. If the player chooses the first option they leave with the Glockenspiel and find that it's fake gold, if they give it to the villagers, they tell them the treasure was fake and give them real gold to leave with. In either ending you see Moop and Dreadly waved off and see them sail away to their next adventure. Gameplay The game allows the player to pick up items, go to different locations, listen to characters, and find trivial click points. Clicking on an item allows the player to drag it over the screen. Clicking on a certain place while holding an object allows our heroes to use it. Most puzzles require the player to make exchanges with characters and trade items. Characters *Moop: Moop is Dreadly's greatest friend and opposite number. He is interested in peace, contentment, and simple pleasures but will allow himself to be dragged along on Dreadly's wild adventures, largely out of a sense of protectiveness. *Captain Dreadly: Dreadly is always looking for the latest adventure, which he follows with a vigor and single mindedness rarely seen in a boy of his age. He typically projects his own enthusiasms onto Moop, dragging him along on these adventures, regardless of Moop's previous plans. *Chief Earwig: Chief Earwig is a man that goes by the book. He has established a thorough set of rules and regulations for the running of Bing Bong Island and executes each of them to the \\"T\\". If it's not on his schedule, or goes against his rules, it simply does not exist. *Mrs. Hornswoggle: Mrs. Hornswoggle hails from England, but travels extensively, and is always on her way to her next destination. She has a tendency to invent new words with which to express herself, but does not appear to be aware that she does this. *O'Grady Ugerman: O'Grady Ungerman has some very interesting ideas. He's creative and smart but a bit out of touch with reality. He always has some sort of plan which might seem like it makes sense at first, but which is ultimately completely whacko. *Jack Tick: The consummate Entertainer, Jack Tick is forever searching for the perfect act for his show at the Bing Bong Lounge. Trouble is, Jack's not very talented. *Captain James Trench: Captain Trench rules the pirate waterways with his malevolent smirk and magnificently evil laugh. Always on the look out for treasures, Trench and his henchmen pose a threat to Moop and Dreadly and the precious Golden Glockenspiel. *Henchmen Mort & Wort: As Captain Trench's faithful yet blundering henchmen, Mort and Wart tend to do more damage to Trench's plans than help. *Princess Connie: A determined and capable young girl, Connie can always be found in the thick of things, usually pursuing her own agenda. Connie's loyalty is to her Island and the Golden Glockenspiel. *Carl Teuffgei: Carl is a very good construction worker. He can build just about anything, but he'll take his own sweet time about it and you'd better not rush him.

Adrienne du Petit-Cambrai was appointed abbess of Forest Abbey by royal letters patent, and was installed 27 September 1587. The monastery had been devastated during the early decades of the Dutch Revolt, and was rebuilt under her leadership. Both the Abbey of Forest and the parish church of Dilbeek claimed to possess the remains of Saint Alena, a situation which Mathias Hovius, Archbishop of Mechelen, regarded as problematic. On 25 September 1600 the reliquary of St Alena was opened and the contents inspected by Pierre Vinck, dean of Brussels. The abbess took the opportunity to remove four small bones from the spine and present them to the countesses of Berlaymont and Arenberg. On 14 February 1601, the archbishop issued letters patent authenticating the relics of St Alena in Forest, and ordering that henceforth nothing resembling human remains was to be carried in the procession of St Alena in Dilbeek, but instead a statue of the saint be used. On 24 June 1601 Abbess Adrienne had the relics in Forest carried in solemn procession.B. Bossue, \\"Les Reliques de Sainte Al√®ne\\", Pr√©cis historiques 10/235 (1 October 1861), pp. 447-450.

Besides her medical practice and outreach, she led many efforts for the American women's suffrage movement through her local clubs and the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. Early life The eldest of the eight living children of Bernard and Eleanor Flemming Southgate, Louise Southgate was born February 20, 1857, in Walton, Kentucky. She was educated at Western College in Oxford, Ohio, then graduated with a medical degree from Laura Memorial College in Cincinnati, Ohio. She then spent two years studying in hospitals in New York and Europe, traveling as far as to the Pasteur Institute in France for advanced work. She lived with her younger sister Virginia and never married. Professional career Dr. Southgate started practicing medicine at the Presbyterian Hospital in Cincinnati in 1893 and also taught at the Laura Memorial College in 1894. She then left for Europe where she practiced medicine for two years. Returning to the U.S. she took up as a clinician again at the Presbyterian Hospital and to the Laura Memorial College where she taught surgical pathology in 1897. She became a member of the American Medical Association, Cincinnati chapter. In 1910 she purchased her maternal grandmother's ancestral home, (the old Thomas Kennedy Home at 124 Garrard Street) and used it also for her private practice. Later, she also worked at the Booth Memorial Hospital as well as its auxiliary. She wrote scholarly articles, including for the State Medical Journal of Kentucky. =Community medicine outreach= Dr. Southgate was part of the growing movement in women's reproductive health and family planning of the time. She spoke on hygiene (\\"Care of the Growing Girl\\"), birth control and eugenics (\\"Sociological Status of Women\\"), connecting this with women's rights (e.g., \\"Women's Duties in Civil Affairs\\") for women's clubs, Mothers' meetings, as well as for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Her work with schools and local clinics helped start the requirements for physical examinations for schoolchildren in Covington. In 1905, Dr. Southgate spent some time at the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, eastern Kentucky, where she taught classes and practiced medicine. She was advocating for women's health concerns there long before the more famous Mary Carson Breckinridge of the Frontier Nursing Service or Jean Tachau worked in this area. =Women's clubs and suffrage organizations= Her work with women's clubs and suffrage organizations was extensive. A partial list of her memberships follows: * Emergency Association of Covington, president * General Federation of Women's Clubs * Kentucky Equal Rights Association, served as KERA press superintendent and State Historian * Kentucky State Federation of Women's Clubs * National Equal Rights Association * Ohio State Federation of Women's Clubs * Woman's Club of Cincinnati In 1910 she spoke at the 21st Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA) state convention in Covington on the \\"Sisterhood of Women.\\" She offered a resolution at that meeting that the KERA \\"extend cordial greetings to the Ky. State Federations of Colored Women's Clubs.\\" Dr. Southgate's influence was revealed in that it was also resolved at that convention that KERA formally requested that the State Board of Charitable Institutions appoint a woman physician at the state asylum for the Insane at Hopkinsville and that each local chapter would begin lobbying for establishing a juvenile court if there wasn't one already in that county. In 1912 she spoke for suffrage in Cincinnati during the campaign for a suffrage amendment of the Ohio Constitution. Hobbies Dr. Southgate was an avid Egyptologist and collected many artifacts that decorated her historic home in Covington (now known as the Kennedy-Southgate House). Death After her sister Virginia died in September 1929, Dr. Southgate retired from medical practice. After a long illness and at 84 years old, she died on August 14, 1941, at the home of her sister Eleanor Green in Walton, Kentucky. She was buried in Linden Grove Cemetery in Covington.https://networks.h-net.org/dr- louise-southgate The St. Luke Hospitals named their Women's Center after her in 1990, and her legacy was honored by an entry in the Kentucky Women Remembered collection by the Kentucky Commission on Women in 2000.

Plot The travelogue format of the film documents the crumbling of the Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe. The film was conceived ‚Äúin the aftermath of impressions, memories, and emotions‚Äù which Akerman brought back following a research trip for a film about the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, whom Akerman cites as a great influence. The structure of D‚ÄôEst is characterized by its sobriety and rigour, used to articulate the film‚Äôs expressiveness. The film utilizes an obsessive, asynchronous rhythm of repetitions and looping. Characters and locations within the film are meticulously examined but their consequent fates are never resolved. The film's long, meditative shots emphasize the circularity of connections between personal and collective histories. The film presents a complex assemblage of images, sounds and connected fragments, which results in a ‚Äúhypnotic inventory of people and landscapes.‚Äù Cinematography The cinematography of D‚ÄôEst uses only available light and is executed through long, real-time shots, contributing to the genuine and unstaged nature of the film. Akerman uses two main filming approaches: the stationary fixed perspective, with figures flowing towards the camera, and the tracking shot, with the camera moving slowly along streets and paths. The film also includes examples of the panning shot, where the camera rotates around a central point. The moving shots convey a sense of anxiety and vertigo. The stalking nature of the shots reveals the inhumanity of the camera. The film does not make a claim to realism or objective expertise regarding the collapse of Communism but instead examines the individual stories of characters in intimate ways, surveying their fear of the surrounding political opacity. Akerman presents a continuous, nonsynchronous montage of images and sounds, provoking unfiltered optical and auditory impressions. The smoothness of the visual continuity is used as a tactic to accentuate the effects of narrative disjunction and discontinuity. Iterations of the film D‚ÄôEst has had several iterations of presentation. Akerman originally showed the film in a traditional format, and later expanded into a multi-media installation. The installation was a part of a discourse about Eastern European identity at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 1991. Kathy Halbreich, executive director of MoMA, describes the exhibition as a deconstructive tour of the production process, examining the nature of filmmaking in reverse. The museum installation was segmented into three viewing chambers. In the first gallery, the film plays in a dark theatre space on a continuous loop. In the second gallery, eight triptychs of video monitors show short sequences from the film simultaneously. In the third gallery, a single video monitor shows Akerman reciting two texts: a biblical passage in Hebrew and a selection from her own writing on the film. Based on the performativity of Akerman‚Äôs work, Hans Ulrich Obrist, critic, curator and art historian, points to the artist‚Äôs occupation of a unique space between the cinema movie and the art installation.

Among the builders were Geo. P. Petersen & Son and M.M. Moen Company (later Davey & Moen). There are also several examples of architect designed buildings. They include Parker's Opera House (1883) by William Foster, the former Mason City Public Library (1904) by Patton & Miller, the Park Inn Hotel (1909) and the City National Bank (1910) by Frank Lloyd Wright, First National Bank (1911) by Liebbe, Nourse & Rasmussen, the MBA Building (1917) by Bell & Bentley, the Hanford Hotel (1921) by Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson, the YMCA (1926) by Tyrie and Chapman, and the former First Church of Christ, Scientist (1928) by Clyde W.

The Bloodbath was used by the Swedes to portray Christian II as an evil tyrant during the Swedish War of Liberation, as it was said that the monks were executed without cause or trial by the king. In practice, however, the monks were likely executed because they cooperated with the Swedes against Danish domination, and as Christian II is confirmed to have been in Denmark the following day, he was most likely not present in Nydala when his army executed the monks.
