On 7 June, the ridge was attacked by the British Second Army; the 36th (Ulster) Division and the 16th (Irish) Division of IX Corps captured the fortified village of Wytschaete on the plateau of Messines Ridge, which had been held by the German 4th Army since the First Battle of Ypres (19 October ‚Äì 22 November 1914). In April 1917, the senior German commanders in Flanders were willing to contemplate a retirement from the Messines salient () but the local (corps) and divisional commanders objected. The convex slope of the eastern side of the ridge would obstruct artillery observation and the proximity of the Ypres‚ÄìComines Canal and the river Lys would hamper the assembly of reserves. The Germans had spent two years fortifying the defences and the local commanders had been assured that British mining attempts had been defeated. The British attack at Messines was set for 7 June and the plan included the detonation of deep mines that had been laid under the German front position since 1915. IX Corps was due to attack the apex of the German salient and advance , to capture the fortified village of Wytschaete and the far side of the plateau. The divisional boundary of the 36th (Ulster) Division and the 16th (Irish) Division ran through the village and battalions of both divisions overran the remaining defenders and captured the village by The German 2nd Division occupied the Wytschaete sector and its infantry was devastated by the seven mine explosions along its part of the front position. The defenders in the village had also suffered severely in heavy artillery and gas bombardments and were not able to resist a British tank and the Irish infantry who overran the village, although at considerable cost to the 16th (Irish) Division. The commander, (Lieutenant-General) Maximilian von Laffert was sacked after the battle; writing after the war, Hermann von Kuhl wrote that had Crown Prince Rupprecht overruled the local commanders on 30 April, the Germans would have avoided one of the \\"worst tragedies of the war\\". Background =Messines ridge= A chain of low hills runs from south-west to north-east around the Belgian city of Ypres in West Flanders, with spurs extending from the east side of the ridge. A spur from Wytschaete to Messines is also a ridge and runs for about south-east from Wytschaete. The ridge has a shallow decline on the east side but an incline of up to the west side. South of the ridge is the marshy valley of the Douve river, then Ploegsteert (Plugstreet to the British) Wood and Hill 63. The Wulverghem (also Spanbroekmolen) Spur is parallel to the ridge on the west side, the Oosttaverne Spur is to the east and lesser spurs descend towards Gheluvelt, Becelaere and Keiberg. South of Ypres, the land is marked by low ridges and shallow depressions; the ridge blocks access to the district of Heuvelland from Werviq, Comines and Warneton in the Lys valley to the east. In 1917, the two villages on the flat-topped ridge were in ruins but had been fortified for all-round defence. The plateau extended further north, via a sunken road known as Damm Strasse to the White Ch√¢teau on the south side of the Ypres‚ÄìComines canal. North of the canal is Hill 60, Observatory Ridge, Stirling Castle and Zonnebeke. =Battle of Messines (1914)= The British 1st Cavalry Division occupied Messines on 14 October 1914. German troops began to attack the ridge during the morning of 21 October and slowly forced back the British left flank. Next day the 2nd Cavalry Division dug in and by 31 October held a line just in front of Messines village. Early in the morning, the Germans attacked and overran the defences on the south-east side of the village but were forced back as dawn broke, as were attackers further north. As mist cleared German artillery bombarded the village and after more attacks the British began slowly to retire to the west side of the village and after a lull the Germans began to fight hand-to hand through the village. During the afternoon, British counter-attacks forced back the German infantry but recaptured few houses. The 2nd Cavalry Division held a line further north was also attacked on 31 October but no ground was lost. At on 1 November Messines and Wytschaete were attacked again and German infantry filtered through gaps in the line and attacked from the flanks and from behind and by early in the morning had captured Wytschaete and the ridge between the villages. Wytschaete was eventually re-captured by British cavalry and infantry of the French 32nd Division but the garrison of Messines was ordered to retreat at to avoid being cut off from the north. By now the line further north was held by French troops, with 32nd Division troops in Wytschaete, which was attacked on 2 November from the south by the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division; the French being forced out of the village. =4th Army= The 4th Army ( (Lieutenant-General) Sixt von Armin) began operations in Belgium in 1914 and by 1917 held the Western Front from the junction with the 6th Army at Warneton to Dixsmude (Diksmuide), under the command of (Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria, Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria). The 4th Army defences on Messines Ridge were held by the divisions of , the IX Reserve Corps headquarters, with the 204th, 35th, 2nd (holding the Wytschaete sector), 40th Division (being relieved by the 3rd Bavarian Division) and the 4th Bavarian Division, where the front line had settled during the Battles of Ypres in 1914. The German defences were on a forward slope and overlooked from Haubourdin Hill south of the Douve valley and Kemmel Hill, west of Wytschaete, which the experience of the battles of 1916 showed to be obsolete. In February 1917, work began on the , incorporating the experience of the Battle of the Somme, behind Messines ridge, northwards from the Lys at Werviq, giving good artillery observation to the west. In April, Rupprecht and his chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Hermann von Kuhl, favoured withdrawal to the , a reserve line just west of Warneton, to forestall a British attack. The divisional commanders objected, having been assured that counter-mining had neutralised the British underground threat and because of the inferiority of the as a defensive position. The convex eastern slope of Messines Ridge limited artillery observation, the Ypres‚ÄìComines Canal and the river Lys restricted the space below the ridge where infantry could manoeuvre for counter-attacks. British observation from the ridge would make the ground to the east untenable as far back as the . A withdrawal to the east would uncover the southern slopes of Menin Ridge, the most vital part of position. Rupprecht re-examined the and the (Oosttaverne Line to the British) to the west between the and the (higher line) on the ridge and dropped the withdrawal proposal. By June, had guns, guns and guns and howitzers on its front from St Yves to Mt Sorrel. Prelude =German defences= The German front line regiments in the (Wytschatete arc/salient) held areas wide with one (the , battle battalion) forward, a second (, readiness battalion) in support and the third (, rest battalion) in reserve back. About posts per regimental sector were dispersed around the defensive zone. The German defence was intended to be mobile and in Ic the third breastwork, were to conduct immediate counter-attacks to recapture Ia and Ib. If they had to fall back, the support battalions would advance to restore the front system, except at Spanbroekmolen, which due to its importance was to be held at all costs (). (General Maximilian von Laffert) held Wytschaete with the 2nd Division on a front of ; the front position was lightly held, with strongpoints distributed up to back. At the end of May, British artillery fire was so damaging that the relief of the 2nd Division was promised for June. was substantially reinforced with artillery, ammunition and aircraft and the 35th and 3rd Bavarian divisions, which had been trained as (specialist counter-attack divisions), were used to relieve the and to replace them, two divisions were transferred from , which did not know the area and had no training. The preliminary bombardment began on 8 May and intensified on 23 May. The breastworks of the front position trenches were demolished and concrete shelters on both sides of the ridge were systematically destroyed. Air superiority allowed the British artillery observation aircraft to cruise over the German defences, despite the efforts of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1, the Richthofen Circus) of the . On 26 May, the German front garrisons were ordered to move forward into shell-holes in no man's land at dawn and return to their shelters at night. When the shelters were destroyed, the shell-hole positions were made permanent, as were those of the support companies further back. Troops in the were withdrawn behind the ridge and by the end of May, the front battalions were being relieved every two days instead of every five, to maintain their battle-worthiness. The village of Wytschaete was on the summit of the ridge and the main defensive position at the north end of the plateau, having been fortified and prepared for all-round defence. A line of trenches traced the edge of the village and an inner line went round the houses at the village square and the church. The most formidable part of the defences were machine-gun nests in emplacements and house cellars along the western fringe of the village. Some troops on the ridge were convinced that their positions had been undermined and their morale was depressed further by a prisoner taken on 6 June, who said that the attack would be synchronised with mine explosions. On 1 June, the British bombardment became more intense and nearly every German defensive position on the forward slope was obliterated. British heavy and super-heavy artillery bombardments Wytschaete on 3 June and were followed up by a gas bombardment from the field artillery, which smashed many of the defensive positions in the village. Infantry Regiment 44 lost 57 men killed and 198 wounded from 1‚Äì6 June, Grenadier Regiment 4 and Fusilier Regiment 33 having about the same number of casualties each. The German air effort reached its maximum from when German aircraft observed counter-battery shoots. Wireless interception by the British showed that German aircraft escorted by up to seven fighters each, were directing the German artillery reply against the Second Army. British air observation on the reverse slope was less effective than in the foreground but Messines and Wytschaete villages were demolished, as were much of the and (Oosttaverne Line) although many pill boxes survived. Long-range fire on Comines, Warneton, Wervicq, smaller villages, road junctions, railways and bridges caused much damage and several ammunition dumps were destroyed. =British preparations= The British had begun to mine under Messines Ridge in 1916; sappers tunnelled into a layer of blue clay below the surface, then drifted galleries to points deep underneath the German front position. Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and British miners laid 26 mines with of ammonal explosive. On the right flank of the 36th (Ulster) Division the 107th Brigade faced three mines at Kruisstraat and north was the larger Spanbroekmolen mine. The mine close to Peckham House was opposite the 109th Brigade on the left flank. The 47th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division was to advance into the area of the Maedelstede mine and the 49th Brigade past two at Petit Bois. On the left of the 16th (Irish) Division, the 19th (Western) Division was also to advance with the assistance of mines north of Wytschaete. The Second Army devised a centralised artillery plan of great sophistication, using field survey, gun calibration, weather data and a new and highly accurate map, to increase the accuracy of British artillery. Wire cutting bombardments had to destroy about of barbed wire and using the new methods, all German guns within of the attack front were to be neutralised. Methodical target-finding with new sound-ranging equipment, better organisation of flash- spotting and the centralisation of command at a new Army Report Centre, based at Locre Ch√¢teau were introduced. Second Army counter-battery artillery bombardments increased from twelve in the week ending 19 April, to in the last ten days before the attack. IX Corps arranged four counter-battery groups, each with one heavy artillery group and five bombardment groups, one for each of its three attacking divisions and two (with the heaviest howitzers) in reserve. A Heavy Artillery Group Commander was attached to each divisional artillery headquarters, to command the heavy artillery once the infantry attack began. The IX Corps field artillery groups and sub-groups were formed to have an artillery liaison officer for every infantry brigade, with two sub- groups, one with six batteries and one with six batteries. Surplus field artillery brigade headquarters planned forward moves for the guns and were kept ready to replace casualties. It was expected that much of the artillery would need to switch rapidly from bombardment to engaging German counter- attacks and divisional Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) were to control the artillery which had remained in place. The reserve divisions due to advance to the Oosttaverne Line would control artillery hidden close to the front line and the guns moved forward into no man's land. Two thirds of the were to fire a creeping barrage of shrapnel immediately ahead of the advance, while the remainder of the field guns and howitzers were to fire a standing barrage, further ahead on German positions and lift to the next target, when the infantry came within of the barrage. Each division was given four extra batteries of field artillery, which could be withdrawn from the barrage at the divisional commander's discretion to engage local targets. The field batteries of the three reserve divisions were placed in camouflaged positions, close to the British front line. As each objective was taken by the infantry, the creeping barrage was to pause ahead and become a standing barrage, while the infantry consolidated. During this time the pace of fire was to slacken to one round per-gun per-minute, allowing the gun-crews a respite, before resuming full intensity as the barrage moved on. The heavy and super-heavy artillery was to fire on German artillery positions and rear areas and were to fire a barrage over the heads of the advancing troops. In the week up to 7 June, and howitzers bombarded the German trenches, cut wire, destroyed strong-points and conducted counter-battery fire against the guns opposite, using The intensity of bombardment in the salient began to increase on 8 May, wire cutting began on 21 May and an extra two days were added to the bombardment for more counter-battery fire. The general bombardment intensified again from 23 May, smashing the German breastworks in the first position and the pillboxes on the forward slope. The main bombardment began on 31 May, with only one day of poor weather before the attack and until the infantry advance, more than 3,000,000 shells were fired on a front. The attack barrage was rehearsed on 3 June to allow British air observers to plot masked German batteries, which mainly remained hidden but many minor flaws in the British barrage were reported. A repeat performance on 5 June induced a larger number of hidden German batteries to open fire and reveal themselves. Wytschaete was subjected to a special super-heavy bombardment and the garrison from Grenadier Regiment 4 reported that the village was smashed by columns of shells dropping onto the village. =Air operations= Two flights of each artillery-observation squadron concentrated on counter-battery observation and one became a bombardment flight, working with particular artillery bombardment groups for wire-cutting and trench-destruction; when the attack began, these flights undertook contact-patrols to observe the positions of British troops. German artillery positions and the were on the reverse slope and not visible to British ground observers. For observation over the rear slopes of the ridge, were concentrated in II Brigade RFC and eight balloons of II Kite Balloon Wing were placed behind the British front line. British fighter aircraft tried to prevent German aircraft observing for their artillery, by dominating the air from the British front line to the German balloon line, about beyond. The \\"barrage line\\" was patrolled all day for the week before the attack by fighters at , with more at in the centre of the attack front. The weather was fair or fine except for , when it was very bad). No British corps aircraft were shot down by German aircraft until 7 June, when aircraft were directing artillery fire simultaneously. Behind the British barrage line was a second line of defence, which used wireless interception to take bearings on German artillery observation aircraft and guide British aircraft into areas where German flights were most frequent. Aeroplane compass stations and an aeroplane intercepting station, were linked by telephone to the army wing headquarters, fighter squadrons, the anti-aircraft commander and the corps heavy artillery headquarters. Areas threatened by German bombardment could be warned, German artillery-observation aircraft could be attacked and German artillery batteries fired on, when they revealed themselves. From , II Brigade had through wireless interception, shot down one German aircraft, damaged seven and stopped artillery bombardments. Normal offensive patrols continued beyond the barrage line out to a line from Ypres to Roulers and Menin, where large formations of British and German aircraft clashed in long dogfights, after German air reinforcements arrived. Longer-range bombing and reconnaissance flights concentrated on German-occupied airfields and railway stations; the night bombing specialists of 100 Squadron attacked trains around Lille, Courtrai, Roulers and Comines. Two squadrons were reserved for close air support on the battlefield and low attacks on German airfields. IX Corps preparations The 2nd Field Survey Company (2nd FSC) set up W Section for sound-ranging in the IX Corps sector, which provided targeting information for the corps counter-battery artillery. Communication was to be by visual means, messenger pigeon, wireless, Fullerphone, runners and SOS rockets. Two cable lines up to the front line were buried by the Royal Engineers Signal Service for the Fullerphones and advanced bases were chosen in the German lines at Spanbroekmolen and Peckham, to be connected by armoured cables across no man's land. When the infantry reached the final objective the advanced stations were to move up to the crest of the ridge. Brigade intelligence sections were to set up observation posts at Spanbroekmolen and Peckham and battalion intelligence sections were to follow their battalions and find places to observe the infantry up to the final objective and send scouts to contact flanking battalions and establish the situation. A divisional signal station was installed on Kemmel Hill in line of sight with the brigade advanced sections to communicate via Lucas lamp. Attack training took place on ground marked to show the German defences and officers of flanking battalions attended training sessions to ensure that plans were compatible. A scale model of the ridge was built by the IX Corps Chief Engineer on the Scherpenberg Hill between Locre and La Clytte, with boards around the edges for about a company of men to examine the model together. To assist with communication a message map was devised with the map on one side and a form on the other containing a list of the information needed by the recipient to act on it. Supply dumps for the 36th, 16th and 19th divisions were established at Lindenhoek crossroads, on the Lindenhoek‚ÄìNeuve Eglise road and beyond these was an advanced dump a brigade dump and one for each of the six attacking battalions. A pack- transport system and packs for carriers were issued, along with plans to carry up a hot meal to the front line on the midnight before the attack. Oranges, Oxo cubes, chewing-gum and lime juice were issued to each man and every fourth man had a tin of solidified alcohol for cooking. The 16th (Irish) Division began training for the attack in April, the 49th Brigade rehearsing over a replica of the ground around Wytschaete, during which the junior officers were put under great pressure to perform. The division used the model of Messines Ridge near the Scherpenberg for everyone to become familiar with Wytschaete and the vicinity; the model was adapted to every German alteration to the defences as the British artillery smashed some and the Germans dug others. The division patrolled and raided almost nightly to gather information; a raid on 27 May consisting of took killed troops and lifted many valuable documents and reconnaissance photographs, for On 4 June, raided Wytschaete Wood, killed and captured From the 16th divisional artillery 18-pounder field gun shells 4.5-inch howitzer rounds beyond the divisional sector from Maedelstaede Farm to the Vierstraat‚ÄìWytschaete road. The attack was to be conducted by the 47th Brigade and the 49th Brigade, in which each brigade would attack on a two- battalion front, with two battalions in support, the 48th Brigade and a brigade of the 11th Division being held in reserve. IX Corps Plan IX Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon) was to attack Wytschaete with the 36th (Ulster) Division and 16th (Irish) Division, supported by of the II Brigade, Heavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps and the 11th (Northern) Division in reserve. IX Corps had three intermediate objectives, where fresh infantry would leap-frog through the troops on the objective to continue the advance to the next objective, followed by an advance down the far slope in the afternoon. IX Corps was to attack on a front, which tapered to on the plateau. At the mines would be detonated and the blue line (first objective) was to be occupied by followed by a two-hour pause. At the advance to the black line (second objective) would begin and consolidation was to start by Fresh troops from reserve would then pass through, to attack the Oosttaverne Line at As soon as the black line was captured, all guns were to bombard the Oosttaverne Line, conduct counter-battery fire and place a standing barrage beyond the black line, the in reserve would join the tanks still operational and join in the advance to the Oosttaverne Line. Battle =IX Corps= 36th (Ulster) Division Zero hour was when visibility was expected to be . The usual pattern of night bombardment had continued as a deception but then the mines and the British artillery were fired. Crimson cylinders of flame rose from the mines and pieces of earth landed distant. Black smoke rose after the flames; there was a flash, the earth shook and then a great roar moved outwards from the detonations. In twilight and dust the first wave advanced at an interval of in case of a German counter-barrage. The Spanbroekmolen mine was fifteen seconds late and some soldiers of the 14th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles (RIR) were knocked over, then got up and closed up to the creeping barrage. Keeping direction was difficult while going round the crater edges and platoon commanders used compasses to find the way. Men from the 25th Division on the right strayed into the 36th (Ulster) Division area causing minor congestion but the Germans still alive in the front position were incapable of resistance. Two machine-guns fired on the 109th Brigade front after the British barrage had passed over them; one gun was knocked out by rifle-grenade fire and the other by a Lewis gun. The German artillery reply was poor and fell on the empty British front line as the British infantry followed the creeping barrage, reaching the red line at the mopping up battalion collecting prisoners. The barrage stood still for fifteen minutes and the two following companies in each battalion leap-frogged the leading ones, ready to take over the advance to the blue line. As the advance resumed, the right hand battalion of the 107th Brigade descended into the Steenbeek valley on the right; as soon as the barrage had passed, German machine-guns began to fire from L'Enfer Wood (), Earl Farm, Skip Point and Scott Farm. Machine-guns at Skip Point fired until the 9th RIR and troops from the 14th RIR rushed them from two directions; the garrison fought on inside until more than surrendered. At Scott Farm, the commander stood on the blockhouse rallying the garrison until shot down by a sniper, which caused the Germans inside to surrender. The most formidable German position below the ridge was at Jump Point but this fell quickly and the leading waves reached the blue line at in contact with the flanking divisions. The advance halted again and the troops began to consolidate the ground as the four battalions to attack the black line moved forward in artillery formation, the 107th Brigade battalions encountering a small amount of German artillery-fire in the Steenbeek valley but losing few casualties. At the barrage began to move forward towards the green intermediate line and as the troops moved beyond it, the garrison of Pick House offered resistance. Rifle-grenades were fired along with a captured machine-gun from the flank and the troops inside surrendered. (The British Vickers gun crews had fallen behind, toiling over the crater- fields with the guns, tripods and ammunition boxes.) The 10th Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (RIF) to the north was held up by a machine-gun but a tank nearby was directed towards it and knocked out the gun. The left flank of the Inniskillings was pinned down by German infantry lined along a ditch until a platoon of the 9th Battalion outflanked the position, killed three of the Germans and took the rest prisoner. The 9th Inniskillings and two tanks attacked right-hand side of Wytschaete and the battalion fought its way through the village, taking a battalion headquarters and about fifty prisoners in a house near the Messines‚ÄìSt Eloi road. The German defence was most successful on the right flank against the 15th RIF, where before the road between Messines and Wytschaete, German machine-gunners forced the attackers under cover until the positions of the strongpoints were found. A Lewis gun fired at Lumm Farm () on the right, while the rest of the platoon attacked and another machine-gun nest on the left was engaged; Lumm Farm was captured by hand-to-hand fighting. Consolidation of the black line began and at patrols went forward, keeping touch with the flanking divisions, for about to the dotted black line (later called the mauve line), which was to be held as an outpost line. Field artillery began to move up to the old front line and some crossed no man's land to the red line, the move being completed just after but no sign of a substantial German counter-attack was seen for another two hours. Around noon, IX Corps HQ reported that German infantry and transport had been reported moving west from the Ypres‚ÄìComines Canal at Houthem by aircraft and balloon observers. The digging in on the black line and strong points further back was well advanced, engineer stores were delivered by pack mule and a big dump of German barbed wire found at Guy Farm was commandeered. 16th (Irish) Division The attacking troops began their assembly on 6 June, collecting equipment from dumps as they moved to their jumping-off points. From on 7 June, the British artillery fell silent and then at the mines began to detonate. As soon as the mines had gone off, the British artillery opened fire, creating three barrage lines and the counter-battery groups bombarded German artillery positions with gas. The infantry began to advance, finding it darker than expected, thevisibility being reduced by the smoke and dust of the mines mixing with that of the shell explosions. The view was limited to , illuminated only by white and green SOS flares rising from the German lines. The 16th (Irish) Division attacked between Maedelstede Farm and the Vierstraat‚ÄìWytschaete road and found that the mines at Maedelstede and the two on the left at Petit Bois had devastated the defenders. The mines at Petit Bois in the 49th Brigade area were about late and knocked over some of the advancing infantry. The advance continued through the remains of Wytschaete wood and Grand Bois, which had been hit by a Livens Projector bombardment on the night of and by standing barrages on all the known German positions in the woods. The garrison of l'Hospice in the northern part of the wood were by- passed and did not surrender until The second intermediate objective, the first trench of the German second line, on the west side of the plateau, was reached just after (Captured records showed that the Germans had predicted that an attack could be stopped short of the western crest, until reinforcements from the divisions arrived.) A two-hour pause ensued, before the attack on the next objective, the second trench of the German second line at the rear (eastern) crest of the ridge, began and at the British artillery barrages began to creep forward again. The infantry of the 16th (Irish) Division followed with some of the of the II Tank Brigade in support. A tank drove into Wytschaete, followed by the 1st Battalion Munster Fusiliers, who advanced into the wreckage of the village from all sides as the 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment captured the northern fringe. The infantry found that the special bombardment on 3 June had demolished the houses and the area was quickly overrun. The Germans in the woods nearby held out for longer, despite the Livens Projector bombardment, managing to get several machine-guns into action. Half of the attacking companies were reserved for mopping up in the village and by the village had been secured. The supporting battalions leap- frogged through the attacking battalions and several tanks passed through to the eastern side of the village on schedule at although all the tanks broke down. The attacking battalions overran other troops of Grenadier Regiment 4 in the (Heights Line) and reached the objective on the far side of the Messines‚ÄìSt Eloi road, in touch with the 36th (Ulster) Division on the right. By the division had captured and passed on another to neighbouring divisions. =Air support= As the infantry moved to the attack contact-patrol aircraft flew low overhead, two being maintained over each corps during the day. The observers were easily able to plot the positions of experienced troops, who lit flares and waved anything to attract attention. Some troops, poorly trained and inexperienced, failed to co-operate, fearing exposure to the Germans so aircraft flew dangerously low to identify them, four being shot down in consequence. Although air observation was not as vital to German operations because of their control of commanding ground, the speed by which reports from air observation could be delivered made it a most valuable form of liaison between the front line and higher commanders. German infantry proved as reluctant to reveal themselves as the British so German flyers also had to make visual identifications. Reports and maps were dropped at divisional headquarters and corps report centres, allowing the progress of the infantry to be followed. During the pause on the ridge crest, an observer reported that the Oosttaverne Line was barely occupied, at a balloon observer reported a heavy German barrage on the II Anzac Corps front and a counter- attack patrol aircraft reported German infantry advancing either side of Messines. The German counter-attack was \\"crushed\\" by artillery fire by Each corps squadron kept an aircraft on counter-attack patrol all day, to call for barrage fire if German troops were seen in the open. The speed of the British advance resulted in few German counter-attacks. Artillery observers watched for German gunfire and made calls but only to have German guns engaged. (Zones were based on lettered squares of the army 1:40,000 map; each map square was divided into four sections of . The observer used a call-sign of the map square letter then the zone letter to signal to the artillery. All guns and howitzers up to able to bear on the target, opened rapid fire using corrections of aim from the air observer. The observers regulated the bombardment of the Oosttaverne Line and the artillery of VIII Corps to the north of the attack, which was able to enfilade German artillery opposite X Corps. Fourteen fighters were sent to strafe from low altitude, German ground targets ahead of the British infantry, roving behind German lines, attacking infantry, transport, gun-teams and machine-gun nests; the attacks continued all day, with two of the British aircraft being shot down. Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at Bisseghem and Marcke near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at Ramegnies Chin, Coucou, Bisseghem (again) and Rumbeke. Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy‚ÄìWarneton, led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes. German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps observation aircraft over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day. After dark, the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton, Menin and Courtrai. Ignorance of the situation at the northern end of the II Anzac Corps front, was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June.  At on 7 June, the British artillery bombardment ceased; expecting an immediate infantry assault, the German defenders returned to their forward positions. At mines began to explode, destroying most of the middle breastwork Ib of the front system, killing most of the garrison and paralysing the survivors of the eleven German battalions in the front line, who were swiftly overrun. The 2nd Division, holding the Wytschaete sector received seven of the mine detonations. Some of the (Stormtroops) in breastwork Ic were able to counter-attack but were overwhelmed quickly, as the British advanced. The usually held half of the support battalions but had been reduced to about and six machine-guns in each regimental sector (). Smoke and dust from the British barrage limited visibility to and some defenders thought that figures moving towards them were German and were also overrun. After a pause, the British continued to the , held by half of the support battalions, a company of each reserve battalion and machine-guns, per regimental . The sun was up but the defenders only saw occasional shapes in the dust and smoke as they endured a deluge of artillery fire and strafing by swarms of British aircraft. The German defence around Messines at the south end of the ridge collapsed, uncovering the left flank of each unit further north in turn, forcing them to retire to the , except for the garrison of Wytschaete, which held on, waiting to be freed by counter-attacks. Laffert expected the two divisions to reach the before the British. The divisions had reached assembly areas near Gheluvelt and Warneton by and the 7th Division was ordered from Zandvoorde to Hollebeke, to attack into the British northern flank across the Comines canal towards Wytschaete. On the southern flank, the 1st Guard Reserve Division was to move to the Warneton line east of Messines, then advance around Messines to recapture the original front system. Neither division had been trained for operations, were new to the area and their advances were plagued by delays; the 7th Division was shelled by British artillery all the way to the Comines canal. Part of the division was diverted to reinforce the remnants of the front divisions around Hollebeke and when the rest of the division arrived at the British had already taken the . The 1st Guard Reserve Division was bombarded as it crossed the Warneton (third) line but reached the area east of Messines by only to be devastated by the British barrage as it began to creep forward again. The division was forced back to the and Laffert contemplated ordering a further withdrawal, until discovering that the British advance had stopped. Aftermath =Analysis= Cyril Falls, the 36th (Ulster) Division historian, wrote in 1922 that at conferences and in questionnaires there was some criticism of H-Hour being a few minutes too early and that the creeping barrage had moved too quickly but that the troops had kept up, which contributed to the success of the attack. The mine explosions had guaranteed the capture of the front system up to the red line and had thoroughly demoralised the Germans further back; the tanks had been useful and had prevented some casualties but were not essential to the success of the attack. All regimental officers praised the rear-area services for their prompt arrival on the ridge with supplies, stores and equipment. The infantry judged the new platoon structure introduced in February 1917 with SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, to have turned platoons into \\"...a little self-sufficing force, an army in miniature....\\", some of which had been led with great tactical skill. In 1948, the British official historian, James Edmonds wrote that the Battle of Messines was a great victory, which had been achieved with a speed surpassing all other British defeats of the Germans; only the capture of Vimy Ridge in April stood comparison. After two years of occupation, the Germans had been ejected from the high ground on the south side of the Ypres Salient; all of the objectives had been captured and had been taken. The British had suffered few casualties in the attack but the unexpectedly low losses had led to overcrowding on the ridge which was exploited by the Germans close to the ridge to engage with machine-guns and such artillery as was still operational. The division of authority between two artillery command structures had also caused problems, with one set of observers accidentally bombarding troops in contact with the other organisation and of from more than 50 percent were in the II Anzac Corps. Edmonds wrote that the victory was not exploited by gaining ground at the west end of the Gheluvelt Plateau, which had been emphasised in earlier plans. =Casualties= In 1948, James Edmonds, the British official historian, gave casualties of in IX Corps. Cyril Falls, the 36th ( Ulster) Division historian wrote in 1922, that the division had about in the attack, inflicted around three times that number on the defenders; up to 9 June the division had and took In 2014, Terence Denman wrote that the 16th (Irish) Division had from the night of Edmonds recorded including from using strength returns for , and in Der Weltkrieg. Edmonds then wrote that should be added for wounded likely quickly to return to duty, since they were \\"omitted\\" in Der Weltkrieg, a claim that has been severely criticised ever since. In 2007, Sheldon gave for the German 4th Army from 1917. On 8 June, Grenadier Regiment 8 of the 2nd Division was relieved and only were left of the troops in the front position; in one day the regiment had suffered Fusilier Regiment 33 had and Infantry Regiment 44 lost =Subsequent operations= Oosttaverne Line A pause of five hours was considered necessary to defeat the German divisions, before resuming the advance on the Oosttaverne () line. The pause was extended by two hours to , after Plumer received reports on the state of the ground. More artillery joined the masked batteries close to the front line and others moved as far into no-man's-land as the terrain allowed. On the nearside of the ridge, were prepared to fire an overhead barrage and each division placed sixteen more guns in the observation line on the eastern slope. The in reserve began to advance at twelve to join IX Corps; surviving tanks of the morning attack in X Corps, were to join in from Damm and Denys woods. On the IX Corps front, the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) had been ordered to advance to Vandamme Farm at but the message was delayed and the troops did not reach the assembly area at Rommens Farm until half an hour late. To cover the delay, the corps commander ordered the 57th Brigade (19th Division) from reserve, to take the Oosttaverne Line from Van Hove Farm to Oosttaverne village then to Bug Wood, so that only the southern were left for the 33rd Brigade. These orders were also delayed and the 19th Division commander asked for a postponement then ordered the 57th Brigade to advance without waiting for the 33rd Brigade. The troops only knew that they were to advance downhill and keep up to the barrage but were able to occupy the objective in against light opposition, meeting the Australians at Polka Estaminet.

Whittaker was the first female CEO of a TSX listed company and during her career held senior positions at Electronic Data Systems, Royal Bank of Canada, CanWest Global Communications Corporation and Standard Life. She has regularly spoken on feminist issues. Early life Whittaker was born in Ottawa and raised in Alberta, Canada. Career Whittaker began her career as a federal anti-trust officer and gained her MBA at York's Schulich School of Business. She spent much of her early career working for The Canada Consulting Group, now Boston Consulting Group, as a director and then partner. Following this, Whittaker became Vice President of Planning and Corporate Affairs at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. While at the CBC, Whittaker helped to secure the CRTC licence to operate CBC Newsworld. She then became the President and CEO of Canadian Satellite Communications, better known as Cancom and now a part of Shaw Broadcast Services. In doing so, Whittaker became the first female CEO of a TSX listed company. In 1993, Whittaker joined Electronic Data Systems (EDS) based in Plano, Texas (now a part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise), at that time one of the leading providers of information technology services. Serving first as the President and CEO of EDS Canada, Whittaker went on to become the Executive Vice-President in Asia Pacific in 2001, before transferring to London where she served as the Managing Director, United Kingdom, Africa and Middle East until her retirement in 2005. Whittaker has sat as a non-executive director on several major corporate boards including the Royal Bank of Canada, CanWest Global Communications Corporation and insurance company Standard Life. She is also one of the longest serving independent directors of Imperial Oil, the Canadian subsidiary of ExxonMobil. As a result, Whittaker has been featured on the front of The New York Times as having broken the glass ceiling and been labelled ‚ÄòThe Pioneer‚Äô by The Globe and Mail in their ‚ÄòWomen in Power‚Äô series. Executive appointments While serving at both Cancom and Electronic Data Systems, Whittaker was appointed to several non-executive roles in North America and the UK. In 1993, Whittaker was asked to join the board of the Royal Bank of Canada, by then Chairman and CEO, Allan R. Taylor. She then became an independent Director of Imperial Oil in 1996. During her tenure at Imperial Oil Whittaker has chaired the corporate governance and nominations committee, working with and reporting to Rex Tillerson who headed up the Imperial Oil's US parent company ExxonMobil until his appointment as US Secretary of State by President Trump in 2017. She worked as an Independent Trustee of CanWest Mediaworks Income Fund as well as later serving as both a Director for CanWest Mediaworks in Canada and a General Partner of the CanWest Mediaworks Income Fund. Following her move to the United Kingdom and subsequent retirement from EDS in 2005, Whittaker was appointed to the board of the insurance company Standard Life in September 2009. She served on the board for four years, before retiring in 2013, moving from the parent company to join the board of Standard Life Canada with Chairman David Nish announcing Whittaker would assist the company's ‚Äòimplementation of their strategy in the evolving Canadian market environment‚Äô. During her career, Ms. Whittaker has served as a corporate director on three different continents. Feminism and advocacy for gender equality Whittaker has been featured in the Women of Influence lecture series and is a member of Maclean's Magazine‚Äôs Honour Roll. Mount Saint Vincent University described her as ‚Äòan accomplished Canadian businesswoman with a history of breaking glass ceilings‚Äô. Peter C. Newman, the author of Here Be Dragons: Telling Tales of People, Passion and Power, described Whittaker as a part of a generation of powerful women who were taking up senior executive roles in Canada. Along with Diane McGarry, CEO of Xerox in Canada and Maureen Kempston Darkes, President of General Motors Canada, Whittaker was thought to have been among the first women to cross gender lines and gain power and wealth in an increasingly meritocratic society in Canada. Whittaker has often described how she attempted to make the corporate world work for her. She reportedly used to pretend to be her own secretary to better screen calls and breastfed her youngest son in the boardroom of RBC. Whittaker felt anecdotes of this kind should serve as inspiration to other women who wished to reach senior executive heights; ‚ÄúThere is a point in women‚Äôs lives when they see others going to the top and they ask themselves why not me? I can do this too.‚Äù A self-described feminist, Whittaker has been an advocate for the promotion of female executives. She has said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have true equality when we have as many incompetent women in positions of power as we have incompetent men‚Äù. She has argued for quotas for executive positions and boards. However, her views have often been met by opposition. Whittaker views herself as a part of a generation who have sought to ‚Äústamp out personal and corporate complacency‚Äù in the board room. For her advocacy of gender equality in the workplace and for her career in business, Whittaker has been the recipient of several honorary degrees, including one from Mount Saint Vincent University in 2016 and one from Cape Breton University in 2001. She also received the Outstanding Executive Leadership Award from York University in 1992, the same year she was chosen as ‚ÄúWoman of the Year‚Äù by Canadian Women. Publications Whittaker has published two books. The first, The Slaidburn Angel was published in 2012 by Dundurn Press. Her second book, Evaline: A Feminist‚Äôs Tale was published by Departure Bay in 2016. The Slaidburn Angel tells the true-crime story of a murder in Whittaker's own family, the infanticide of Thomas Gardner in May 1885. The murder occurred near a village in the north of England called Slaidburn. The boy's mother Grace Gardner and her sister Isabella were put on trial for the murder of the child as the only suspects in the crime. Grace Gardner's stepdaughter was Margaret Isherwood, Whittaker's grandmother who was a key witness in the trial. Her second book, Evaline: A Feminist‚Äôs Tale, is a chronicle of the impact of the sixties Women's liberation movement on the life and career of a fictional woman called Evaline Sadlier.

Ahirbudhnya-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ literally means a compendium (samhita) of the serpent-from-the-depths (from ahi for serpent and budhna for bottom / root).Sukumari Bhattacharji, (1988). The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the PurƒÅ·πáas, p.150. CUP Archive It is now practically extinct, with few remnants preserved in southern India, though it was once cultivated in diverse places, including Kashmir, Orissa and Mysore. Description =Characteristics= In the Ahirbudhnya Samhita, Vishnu emanated in 39 different forms.Muralidhar Mohanty, (2003). Origin and development of Vi·π£·πáu cult, p.105. Pratibha Prakashan. The Samhita is characteristic for its concept of Sudarshana. It provides mantras for Shakti and Sudarshana, and details the method of worship of the multi-armed Sudarshana. Its chapters include explanations on the origin of astras (weapons), anga (mantras), Vyuhas, sounds, and diseases, how to make Sudarshana Purusha appear, how to resist divine weapons and black magic, and provides method for making and worshipping the Sudarshana Yantra. The Ahirbudhnya Samhita is the source of Taraka Mantra, Narasimhanustubha Mantra, three occult alphabets, Sashtitantra and select astra mantras. It also mentions the Purusha Sukta. The four Vyuhas in this samhita are Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.Bahadur Chand Chhabra, 2008. Findings in Indian archaeology, p.21. Sundeep Prakashan. As with other samhitas, Ahirbudhnya provides its views on creation, siddhantas, senses, bondage and liberation, and rationale of avatars. There are compositions on rakshas, yantras and yoga. It mentions castes and periods of life, interdependence of two higher castes, and provides its characterization of the ideal purohita, the Mahashanti Karman. Besides the story of Madhu and Kaitabha, the Ahirbudhnya details stories of nine personages, namely, Manishekhara, Kasiraja, Shrutakirti, Kushadhvaja, Muktapida, Vishala, Sunanda, Chitrashekhara, and Kirtimalin. Another characteristic of the Ahirbudhayna Samhita is that it parallels descriptions of philosophical systems found in the Mokshadharma in which Samkhya is mentioned with four other systems, that is, Vedas, Yoga, Pancharatra (satvata) and Pashupata. The Sashtitantra of Ahirbudhnya is close to the Samkhya representation of brahman as the ultimate principle, shakti as synonym for prakriti, with a prominent description of kala (time). A note on yoga is attributed to Hiranyagarbha, who in Shvetashvatara Upanishad is identified with Kapila, though Ahirbudhnya itself makes no such identification. Another feature of the Ahirbudhnya is that the opening line of Yogasutra appears in the Sashtitantra of Ahirbudhnya. The Ahirbudhnya Samhita describes Kundalini Yoga with its chakras. =Concept of caste= In the Ahirbudhnya concept of caste, in the Satya Yuga, a pure group descends from Pradyumna. and a mixed group from Aniruddha and Brahman. However, Manus pass from Pradyumna's care to Aniruddha, with their withdrawal into Aniruddha accompanied by pralaya. The pure beings are Anagamins and Sakrdagamins of Buddhism who owing to their advanced stage of liberation return for one or two lives only. At the end of Satya Yuga, Manu's descendants begin to deteriorate; while the Brahman are filled with better ones among the mixed specimen, until the Kali Yuga when reincarnation becomes possible for everyone. The 400 manavas of Ahirbudhnya become 800 Vishnus of Mahasanatkumara Samhita each of whom is a chieftain (nayaka) of 1000 subjects each, located in 8 regions. But among the 800 Vishnus there are only 300 twice-born manavas, while the original group of Shudras are replaced by 5 mixed groups to eliminate Shudra males altogether. Names are given for each loka having descendants from permutations between mothers and fathers of all 4 varnas, with the samhita noting that innumerable Vishnus reside in Kapila-loka. Notably, the text positions Anagamins and Sakrdagamins of Buddhism as descendants of Pradyumna. =Philosophy= Schrader notes the general trend of Pancharatra is non-advaitic. Though a verse is found in the Padma Tantra where the Lord says to Brahman that there is no difference between the Lord and the liberated soul, pluralism is maintained with the Lord reinstating that \\"liberated souls become like me except for governance of the world\\". While Lakshmi Tantra puts Shri at par with Vishnu, the Ahirbudhnya Samhita puts forth an ambivalent position where the lord and his shakti are inseparable, yet not equal.Pratap Kumar P.,(1997). The Goddess Lak·π£mƒ´: The Divine Consort in South Indian Vai·π£·πáava Tradition, p.135. Volume 95 of AAR Academy Series. Scholars Press. The Ahirbudhnya recognizes one of the eleven Rudras; that is Shiva himself in his Satvik form, in the form of a teacher. In the Veda ahi budhna (serpent of the bottom) is an atmospheric god who Schrader says merged with Rudra-Siva (Pashupati); with Ahi Budhanya in later vedic texts connected to Agni Grahapatya, suggesting this was a benevolent being and not the malevolent Ahi Vritra. Ahirbudhnya and Aja- Ekapada had their share of allocated ghriya (Grihyasutra) rituals. In later puranic literature, Ahirbudhnaya becomes one of the 11 Rudras. Ahirbudhnya Samhita was a Bhagavata text, in which the conceptions of Sudarshana as Ayudhapurusha and Chakravartin were invoked. As per the Samhita, a king who worships Chakravarti inside the Sudarshana Chakra attains the Chakravartin rank; a concept which according to VS Agarwala was new and helped the Bhagavatas to use religious tenets in influencing political thought and state.Wayne Edison Begley.

Extinct samhitas In the 12th chapter of Ahirbudhnya Samhita, 10 Samhitas are mentioned, namely Bhagavat Samhita, Vidya Samhita, Karma Samhita and seven other samhitas all of which are now extinct (non-surviving). Additionally, tantras mentioned in Ahirbudhnya such as Pati tantra, Pasu tantra, Pasa tantra from the Satvata and Pashupata religion are also extinct; though the Sattvata Samhita survives. A small portion of Ahirbudhnya Samhita is available in Telugu. =Inaccessible samhitas= Among the inaccessible (not easily available) samhitas of Pancharatra, documented by Schrader for surviving copies found in different places are: * Isvara Samhita (in Telugu from Mysore) * Kapinjala Samhita (in Telugu from Thirukkovalur) * Parashara Samhita (in Telugu from Bangalore) * Padma Tantra (in Telugu from Mysore) * Brihad Brahma Samhita (in Telugu from Thirupati) * Bharadvaja Samhita (in Telugu from Mysore) * Lakshmi Tantra (in Telugu from Mysore) * Vishnutilaka (in Telugu from Bangalore) * Sriprasna Samhita (in Grantha from Kumbakonam) * Sattvata Samhita (in Devanagari from Conjeevaram).

Biography  = Early life and career = Xia was born in Guixi, Jiangxi. His father, Xia Ding (), was the subprefectural magistrate of Linqing. In the early reign of the Jiajing Emperor, the emperor paid more attention on ceremony. Xia rationalized the emperor's grand scheme for four separate sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, the Sun, and the Moon, and endorsed it. Thus, he gained the emperor's favor. When the Jiajing Emperor went back to Zhongxiang and prayed at Xianling Tomb, Yan Song requested to let officials convey their congratulations. But Xia delayed the congratulations until they were back to Beijing, which depressed the emperor. Then one day, the emperor visited Changping, Xia was late for the reception. This infuriated the emperor, and Xia was reprimanded for his discourtesy. The emperor pointed out that Xia had originally been recommended for promotion from a minor post and that he enjoyed his high status at the emperor's pleasure, thus the emperor issued an order to strip Xia's title, left him a minor one and forced him to retire. Within a matter of days, the emperor relented and prevented Xia from heading home. The punishment was quashed in the end. = Fall from grace = There was a censor Gao Shi () as Xia's closet friend. With his support, Xia Yan caused his political adversary Guo Xun () to be imprisoned in 1541 until his death in the next year. Xia had previously disagreed with Guo Xun's proposal to move the crown prince into one of the two inner palaces that became vacated due to the deaths of two empresses. But when the emperor consulted him, on the issue, Xia made self-contradictory comments that appeared to take Guo Xun's side in the end. Finding it highly objectionable, the emperor began to suspect the censors involved in Guo's case. The emperor also ordered to keep Xia under constant surveillance, and noticed Xia was too indolent to draft the imperial edicts. Although Xia had taken part in various Taoist ceremonies during the 1530s, he was not an enthusiastic participant in the 1540s. On July 1542 the emperor asked several high-ranking officials to ride a horse to work, he also granted them xiangye jin (; a special headgear as something between laurel wreath and kerchief for Taoist rituals, it may be made from leaves of Aquilaria sinensisÂÖÉÊòé‰∫ãÈ°ûÈàî, Vol. 24) to wear. Xia Yan was the only one to refuse; he took a litter and wore the normal trappings, since he thought the wreath violated the rites. = Animosity and retirement = Yan Song seized these opportunities to oust Xia. Yan was promoted to be the Minister of Rites with Xia's help. Nevertheless, they had feuded since Yan entered the Grand Secretariat. Yan conformed with the emperor's expectations as Xia's counter, so he won favour. On one occasion, Yan Song listed Xia's faults to the emperor, especially noting how Xia engineered Guo Xun's downfall. The emperor reproached Xia furiously:History of Ming, Vol.196 > (Since Guo Xun had been imprisoned, why did Xia Yan fabricate evidence > against him, still? The censors ought to be the ears and eyes of the court, > how dared Xia to control them as puppets? If I don't hold court in the > morning, neither Xia went to the Grand Secretary. Such significant military > and political affairs related to national security, Xia actually made > decisions at home in private. Xia regards the classified words I uttered as > a trifling matter. The censors are blind to these situations, they merely > cheated and defamed me. What you have done incur the wrath of gods, the > heavy rains had destroyed crops.) Xia became frightened, he not only apologised but also submitted his resignation to the emperor. Just then a solar eclipse took place. The emperor gave another edict, blaming the officials' misconduct for the abnormal eclipse, and sanctioned Xia's resignation. Many officials expressed their desire to share the responsibility with Xia. The emperor was outraged by their memorials taking Xia Yan's side and punished them. Thirteen officials were exiled in total, and Gao Shi was banished to the frontiers for his impeachment of Guo Xun. = Back to Beijing = Xia's influence was on the skids since 1539. Being angered by Yan's presumptuousness, the Jiajing Emperor longed for a sense of balance. Xia was recalled to Beijing in 1545 as a counterbalance to Yan. Again, they competed fiercely for dominance of the imperial court. When Xia became the Senior Grand Secretary again, he vented his anger by excluding Yan Song from the court affairs, and even exiled the officials that Yan Song had promoted. However, Yan did not dare to resist. Widespread disgust at Yan made Xia popular among his peers and the subordinate officers. Meanwhile, Xia Yan's growing arrogance had offended various persons at court, including the eunuchs, who began to speak disparagingly of Xia in the emperor's presence. The emperor also became increasingly dissatisfied with Xia's qingci (, green poetry; a special poetry for prayer in the Taoist ceremony which was written on a green paper). Xia was not in favour any longer. = Death = Later, the Supreme Commander of Shaanxi Zeng Xian appealed to the emperor to recover Hetao. Xia sought backing from the emperor for this proposal, which the emperor initially took a liking to. In February 1548, however, he suddenly withdrew support. Yan Song disassociated himself from this campaign, and indicated that Xia should be blamed for such an impracticable operation. At the same time, there was a rumour going around against Xia, which made the emperor more angry. He scolded Xia, then stripped of Xia's official title and privileges in the beginning of 1548, but had no intention of executing Xia. There was a gossip that Xia expressed resentment at being punished by the emperor, while Yan kept fabricating evidence against Xia. Thus, the emperor was furious, he ordered to kill Zeng and incarcerate Xia. Heard that he was implicated in Zeng's case as soon as he arrived in Tongzhou, Xia was so scared that fell off his carriage, saying \\"Alas! I have to die! ()\\". He fought to prove his innocence and affirmed that Yan set him up, but his letter to the emperor failed to redress. Several senior officials attempted to intercede with the emperor, the latter not only refused, but also kept all their wages. Perhaps what rankled the emperor was Xia's arrogance rather than the apparent contention. Eventually, Xia was executed at the market publicly on 31 October 1548, following Zeng Xian's death in April. Xia's wife was exiled to Guangxi. = Family = Xia's wife came from Su clan, Su had no child, while Xia's concubine was pregnant, Su envied and forced her to remarry. The latter gave birth to a boy, Su got him back after Xia's death. He died when he was about to be an official, so Xia had no descendant eventually.

War on drugs  On March 16, 2017, Gary Alejano, an opposition lawmaker, filed an impeachment complaint against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, citing thousands of deaths in his crackdown on drug abuse and alleged corruption. The House Justice Committee officially threw out the charge by unanimous vote.  South China Sea dispute  Later, Alejano added changes about his relations with China, saying: \\"He utterly failed and/or refused to assert the country's exclusive sovereign rights and maritime rights and territorial claims over Benham Rise and Panatag Shoal and the rest of the West Philippine Sea.\\" In response to the allegations, Duterte sent the Philippine Navy to occupy several \\"disputed\\" islands. In May 2018, former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay asserted that Duterte may be impeached if he fails to protect the country's territory in the South China Sea. This comment followed reports that the Chinese Army had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defenses on outposts also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines over the previous last 30 days. Duterte has been under harsh criticism for its ineffectual policy of appeasement with the Chinese government. In response, Duterte claimed to the press that Chinese President Xi Jinping swore to protect him from moves that will result in his removal from office. \\"The assurances of Xi Jinping were very encouraging...'We will not allow you to be taken out from your office, and we will not allow the Philippines to go to the dogs,'\\" Duterte said. In July 2018, former Solicitor General Hilbay further explained that, in his legal opinion, Duterte's inaction may cause the Philippines to lose their legal claim due to the waiver doctrine. Such conduct would constitute a betrayal of public trust, is ground for impeachment: \\"I'd say it's a culpable violation of the Constitution,\\" Hilbay said. \\"There's no doubt in my mind as a constitutionalist, as the agent who served as counsel for the Republic, that these are clear betrayals of public trust.\\" Following an incident at the Reed Bank in June 2019 wherein the F/B Gem-Ver, a boat carrying 22 Filipino fishermen sank after being rammed by a Chinese vessel, the wife of its captain opined that she was in favor of impeaching Duterte for continuing to allow Chinese boats to fish in the area. Similarly, Fisherfolk group Pamalakaya also filed an impeachment case against Duterte. Maria Lourdes Sereno ouster The controversial and politically-motivated ouster of the Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno may provide further grounds for Duterte's removal. On May 16, Duterte said, \\"if there's one congresswoman or congressman or a single justice who will say I talked to them (regarding Sereno's removal), I can guarantee you, I will resign.\\"  Others  On 21 June 2019, Rhema International Livelihood Foundation, an alleged donor of Kapa Community Ministry International which was involved in an Ponzi scheme, petitioned the Supreme Court to have Duterte submitted for impeachment proceedings in relation to his actions involving the shutting down of Kapa Community Ministry International. In addition, the petition urged the removal from office of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Emilio Aquino.

These negotiations arose following the decision of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, following the UK's EU membership referendum on 23 June 2016. The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017, when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50. Withdrawal was then planned to occur on 29 March 2019, two years after the date of notification, as specified by Article 50. Negotiations formally opened on 19 June 2017, when David Davis, the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, arrived in Brussels to meet with Michel Barnier, the Chief Negotiator appointed by the European Commission. They began to discuss a withdrawal agreement, including terms of a transitional period and an outline of the objectives for a future UK-EU relationship. In November 2018, European Union officials announced that they would accept no further negotiations or changes before the UK legally leaves. A Brexit withdrawal agreement was finally ratified by the UK and the EU, and came into force from 1 February 2020. With the Brexit negotiations to establish a trade agreement treaty between the EU and the UK has started. In addition, the EU's existing Free Trade and WTO tariff-rate quotas with third countries (agreed while the UK was still a member) may need be split or renegotiated. In March and April 2019, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May and European Union leaders agreed to move the date of the UK's departure to 31 October 2019. May resigned as leader of the ruling Conservative Party on 7 June 2019, and on 23 July, Boris Johnson was elected as her successor. The Johnson ministry reopened negotiations on the withdrawal agreement on 28 August 2019, but declared a pre-condition that the Irish backstop must be scrapped, which the EU said it wouldn't accept. In October 2019, following bilateral talks between Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the UK and EU agreed to a revised deal, which replaced the backstop. In the new Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland protocol, the whole of the UK comes out of the EU Customs Union as a single customs territory. Northern Ireland will be included in any future UK trade deals, but it remains an entry point into the EU Customs Union, creating a de facto customs border down the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly can unilaterally choose to leave the protocol via a simple majority vote. Following the 2019 UK general election, which returned a Conservative majority, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and its programme motion passed first reading in the House of Commons. The agreement was ratified by the UK, on 23 January 2020, and by the EU on 29 January 2020, confirming that a withdrawal agreement was in place when, as planned, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. The withdrawal is followed by negotiations on the future partnership, including a trade deal. Background =2015 United Kingdom general election= In its election manifesto for the United Kingdom general election in May 2015, the Conservative Party promised to call an EU referendum by the end of 2017. The referendum, held on 23 June 2016, resulted in a 51.9% majority vote for leaving the European Union. Preparatory work, and intentions According to the European parliament, \\"For the moment, it appears that the two sides have different views on the sequencing and scope of the negotiations, and notably the cross-over between the withdrawal agreement and the structure of future relations, and this divergence itself may be one of the first major challenges to overcome.\\" =UK negotiation= The Department for Exiting the European Union was originally responsible for overseeing the negotiations to leave the EU and for establishing the future relationship between the UK and EU. This role was later taken over directly by the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office. Original withdrawal agreement (November 2018) negotiation * Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom * Oliver Robbins, Europe Advisor to the Prime Minister and chief negotiator * David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union until 8 July 2018. * Dominic Raab, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 9 July 2018 until 15 November 2018. * Stephen Barclay, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 16 November 2018. * Sir Tim Barrow, UK Permanent Representative to the EU Revised withdrawal agreement (October 2019) negotiation * Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom * David Frost, Europe Advisor to the Prime Minister * Stephen Barclay, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. * Sir Tim Barrow, UK Permanent Representative to the EU Article 50 invocation The United Kingdom's proposed principles were set out in the Article 50 notification: * Constructive discussions * Citizens first * Comprehensive agreement * Minimise disruption * Ireland/Northern Ireland position * Technical talks on detailed policy * Work together on European values The Prime Minister's formal letter of notification was delivered in Brussels on 29 March 2017. It included withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community. The letter recognised that consequences for the UK of leaving the EU included loss of influence over rules that affect the European economy, and UK companies trading within the EU aligning with rules agreed by institutions of which the UK would no longer be part. It proposed agreeing to seven principles for the conduct of the withdrawal negotiation. These are for: # engaging with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. # aiming to strike an early agreement about the rights of the many EU citizens living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union. # working towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking in both economic and security cooperation, and agreeing the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. # working together to minimise disruption and giving as much certainty as possible, letting people and businesses in the UK and the EU benefit from implementation periods to adjust in an orderly way to new arrangements. # in particular, paying attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. # beginning technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, including a Free Trade Agreement covering sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. # continuing to work together to advance and protect our shared liberal, democratic values of Europe, to ensure that Europe remains able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats. Role of the countries of the United Kingdom The constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated his opinion that separate negotiations with the EU institutions by Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection. UK general election The start of negotiations was delayed until after the United Kingdom general election, which took place on 8 June 2017. Antonio Tajani, speaking on 20 April, said the early election should bring stability to the UK, which would have been good for negotiations. In the event, the election led to a hung parliament which has reduced the Prime Minister's room for manoeuvre; in particular in respect of the Irish border question due to her dependency on a confidence and supply agreement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. =EU27 negotiation= * Michel Barnier, Chief Negotiator * Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit Coordinator for the European Parliament and Chair of the Brexit Steering Group * Donald Tusk, President of the European Council * Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission * Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach (October 2019 renegotiation) Following the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50, draft guidelines for the negotiations were sent to EU delegations of the 27 other member states (the EU27). The draft, prepared by the President of the European Council, states that the guidelines define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 and set out the overall positions and principles the Union will pursue throughout the negotiation. It states that in the negotiations the Union's overall objective will be to preserve its interests, those of its member states, its citizens and its businesses, and that, in the best interest of both sides, the Union will be constructive throughout and strive to find an agreement. The draft sets out two core principles: # The European Council will continue to base itself on the principles set out in the statement of Heads of State or Government and of the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission on 29 June 2016. It reiterates its wish to have the United Kingdom as a close partner in the future. It further reiterates that any agreement with the United Kingdom will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and ensure a level-playing field. Preserving the integrity of the European Single Market excludes participation based on a sector-by-sector approach. A non-member of the Union that does not live up to the same obligations as the members cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits. In this context, the European Council welcomes the recognition by the British Government that the four freedoms of the Single Market are indivisible and there can be no \\"cherry picking\\". # Negotiations under Article 50 TEU (Treaty on European Union) will be conducted as a single package. In accordance with the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, individual items cannot be settled separately. The Union will approach the negotiations with unified positions, and will engage with the United Kingdom exclusively through the channels set out in these guidelines and in the negotiating directives. So as not to undercut the position of the Union, there will be no separate negotiations between individual member states and the United Kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union.\\" According to the European Parliament, the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) should enter into force \\"well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019\\", and the negotiations should focus on: * The legal status of European Union citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other member states, as well as other provisions concerning their rights; * The settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union; * The European Union's external border; * The clarification of the status of the United Kingdom's international commitments taken as a Member of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 member states will be the legal successor of the European Union of 28 member states; * Legal certainty for legal entities, including companies; * The designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement. On 18 April 2017, a spokesman for Donald Tusk said \\"We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May\\". On 29 April, the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate. In a speech to a plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels on 22 March 2017, Barnier, as EU Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations, said the EU wanted to succeed by reaching a deal with the British, not against them. On 22 May the European Council, following the approval of the negotiating directives that the EU27 had adopted by strong qualified majority voting, authorised the Commission to open Article 50 discussions with UK, with Michel Barnier appointed as the negotiator. It further confirmed that all agendas, EU position papers, Non-papers and EU text proposals would be released to the public and published on line. =Intergovernmental organisation= Intergovernmental organisations also involved in Brexit uncertainty considerations include the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA expects an agreement to avoid disruption. =Phases= EU27 guidelines include: * Agreement on the so-called \\"divorce bill\\"; * Agreement on rights of EU citizens living in the UK; * Agreement on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic within the withdrawal phase. The second phase, covering the post-Brexit relationship between the EU27 and the UK, was to begin \\"as soon as the European Council decides that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal\\". The earliest opportunity for this decision was 19 October 2017, at a summit of EU leaders. although at that meeting it was agreed to start negotiations during the December meeting. Negotiation policy Some effects of the UK withdrawal could emerge before the UK and the EU27 conclude the Article 50 negotiation, as a result of policies existing when the negotiation begins, or some change of policy later. At the outset policy provisions binding on the EU include principles, aspirations and objectives set out in the TEU (Treaty on European Union) Preamble and Articles, of which :Article 3 mentions the promotion of \\"scientific and technological advance\\" in a context governed by \\"The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples\\", the Union's internal market, \\"work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress\\", and the requirement that \\"The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties\\", and :Article 4 mentions \\"competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States\\". Policies mentioned in the Preamble include: * Achieve the strengthening and convergence of member states' economies and establish an economic and monetary union including a single and stable currency, * Promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection, and implement policies ensuring that advances in economic integration are accompanied by parallel progress in other fields, * Establish a citizenship common to nationals of their countries, * Implement a common foreign and security policy including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, thereby reinforcing the European identity and its independence in order to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world, * Facilitate the free movement of persons, while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples, by establishing an area of freedom, security and justice. * Continue the process of creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. UK policy was stated in a white paper published in February 2017: The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union. In the white paper, UK negotiating policy was set out as twelve guiding principles: :# Providing certainty and clarity, including a \\"Great Repeal Bill\\" to remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the statute book and convert existing EU law into domestic law. :# Taking control of the UK statute book and ending the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the UK. :# Strengthening the Union of all parts of the Kingdom, and remaining fully committed to the Belfast Agreement and its successors. :# Working to deliver a practical solution that allows for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area whilst protecting the integrity of the UK immigration system, and which protects the strong ties with Ireland. :# Controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK. :# Securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other member states. :# Protecting and enhancing existing workers' rights. :# Forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU. :# Forging free trade relationships across the world. :# Remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners. :# Continuing to work with the EU to preserve European security, to fight terrorism, and to uphold justice across Europe. :# Seeking a phased process of implementation, in which both the UK and the EU institutions and the remaining EU member states prepare for the new arrangements. =Pre-negotiation events= On 28 June 2016, five days after the referendum, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel advised the German parliament of the agreed EU negotiation position: the UK could remain in the European Single Market (ESM) only if the UK accepted the ESM's four conditions (free movement of goods, capital, services and labour). While she expected the UK to remain an important NATO partner, the EU's priority was unity and self-preservation. She warned the UK not to delude itself. The next day, Tusk confirmed that the UK would not be allowed access to the ESM unless they accepted its four freedoms. In contrast, at her October 2016 party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were priorities. She wished \\"to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market ‚Äì and let European businesses do the same here\\", but not at the expense of losing sovereignty. The European Commission said it would not start any negotiation before the UK formally invoked Article 50. In November 2016, May proposed that Britain and the other EU countries mutually guarantee the residency rights of the 3.3 million EU citizens in Britain and those of the 1.2 million British citizens living on the Continent, in order to exclude their fates being bargained during Brexit negotiations. Despite initial approval from a majority of EU states, May's proposal was blocked by European Council President Tusk and German Chancellor Merkel. In January 2017, the Prime Minister presented twelve negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek permanent single market membership. She also called for an end to ECJ jurisdiction, a new customs agreement excluding the common external tariff and the EU's common commercial policy, an end to free movement of people, co-operation in crime and terrorism, collaboration in areas of science and technology, engagement with devolved administrations, maintaining the Common Travel Area with Ireland, and preserving existing workers' rights. She also confirmed, \\"that the Government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a meaningful vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force.\\" The European Parliament's lead negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that there could be no \\"cherry picking\\" by the UK in the talks. The statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the letter notifying withdrawal, authorised by the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and signed by the British Prime Minister, was handed to the President of the European Council. The letter called for a \\"deep and special relationship\\" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organization terms, and a weakening of the UK's cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. In the letter, the Prime Minister reasoned that, as the EU leaders did not wish \\"cherry picking\\" of the ESM, the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU. In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future cooperation without first settling the terms of the divorce, Verhofstadt referred to the letter as \\"blackmail\\" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that the UK's decision to quit the block was a \\"choice they will regret one day\\". A meeting at 10 Downing Street took place on 6 April 2017 between Theresa May and Donald Tusk to discuss \\"the way ahead on Brexit\\". Another meeting took place in London on 20 April 2017, this time between Theresa May and Antonio Tajani to discuss the rights of EU citizens. After the 20 April meeting, Antonio Tajani said the UK and EU27 timetables fitted well together, with a two-year exit deal negotiation followed by a three-year transition phase. A 10Downing Street meeting between Theresa May, Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker took place on 26 April to discuss the withdrawal process. May reiterated the UK's aim for a \\"deep and special partnership\\" after Brexit. On 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state unanimously accepted, without further discussion, negotiating guidelines prepared by the President of the European Council. The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, whereby the UK first needs to agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, before the EU27 will entertain negotiations on a future relationship. Nevertheless, a 4 March 2017 report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords stated that, if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the two-year negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment. Similarly, the Prime Minister insisted to EU Commission President Juncker that talks about the future UK-EU relationship should start early and that Britain did not owe any money to the EU under the current treaties. At 29 April summit, a meeting took place between Michel Barnier and both houses of the Irish parliament on 11 May, where Barnier assured members of D√°il √âireann and Seanad √âireann that Europe would \\"work with you to avoid a hard border\\". Barnier went on to say that \\"the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in the negotiations\\", and that \\"there is always an answer\\". In May 2017, unflattering details of a four-way meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and his chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr were leaked to the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, presumably by Martin Selmayr. According to the leaked description, Juncker claimed that Theresa May was \\"living in another galaxy\\" when suggesting that British and EU migrant rights could be rapidly negotiated and agreed in the course of June 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel concurred the next day, saying there were \\"illusions\\" on the British side. A few days later, Juncker disclaimed responsibility and called the leak a mistake, Der Spiegel magazine reported that Angela Merkel was annoyed with Juncker for the leak, while European Council President Tusk admonished participants to use discretion during the negotiations. The background for German nervousness allegedly is the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which for example in the immediate term amount to four billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and \\"will hurt us\\" according to German MEP Jens Geier. On 22 May 2017, the Council of the EU authorised its negotiators to start the Brexit talks and it adopted its negotiating directives. The first day of talks took place on 19 June, where Davis and Barnier agreed to prioritise the question of residency rights, while Davis conceded that a discussion of the Northern Irish border would have to await future trade agreements. The UK and EU negotiators agreed that initial negotiations, relating especially to residency rights, would commence in June 2017 (immediately after the French presidential and parliamentary elections), and full negotiations, relating especially to trading agreements, could commence in October 2017 (immediately after the 2017 German federal election). EU negotiators have stated that an agreement must be reached between Britain and the EU by October 2018 in order to leave time for national parliaments to endorse Brexit. Negotiation for withdrawal agreement =2017= The United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 2017. This started a two-year negotiation period but negotiations did not formally begin until 19 June 2017 =2018= The UK Government published several proposals during 2018, including the Chequers plan in July which sought to serve as the basis of the UK-EU trade deal, and a draft Withdrawal Agreement which the UK Government and EU agreed in November 2018. The Chequers plan led to the resignation in July of David Davis as the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and his replacement, Dominic Raab, resigned in November after the publication of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. He was replaced by Stephen Barclay. Negotiations over the Irish border question and the Irish backstop were frequently central to the debate around the Withdrawal Agreement. =2019= Approaching the end of the two-year negotiation period in March 2019, Theresa May and European leaders agreed a delay for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to approve the proposed Withdrawal Agreement. As it was rejected for the third time, a further extension (to 31 October 2019) was agreed in April 2019, with an option to terminate UK membership earlier should the Withdrawal Agreement be passed by the UK Parliament before then (which it did not). The consequence of this extension was that the UK (being still a member) had to take part in the 2019 European Parliament election in May 2019. In early October the UK parliament approved delay until 31 January 2020. On 17 October, Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker announced that they had finally reached agreement (subject to ratification) on a new Brexit withdrawal agreement on terms which both parties considered acceptable. On 30 October 2019, the day named as \\"exit day\\" in UK legislation was changed to 31 January 2020 at 11.00 p.m.The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30th October 2019. The Parliaments of the UK and of the EU approved the agreement in January 2020 and Brexit finally happened at that time. Financial settlement Two different legal approaches arose in determining the financial element of the Brexit withdrawal agreement and (at least initially) the UK and EU negotiators differed on which would be the more appropriate. From Michel Barnier's point of view, the budget contributions that were agreed by 28 member states have to be paid by 28 member states, until the end of that budget period. David Davis said the \\"UK wants to go through the Brexit bill line-by-line to work out what it owes the EU.\\" A leaving state is legally obliged to contribute to the EU budget beyond its membership period or to continue to honour the commitments it made during the (pre-Brexit) budget setting process. The leaders of France and Germany both stated that the UK would need to agree to terms regarding departure before discussing future relationships. This has been reinforced by EU27 guidelines issued to the remaining 27 countries. The UK has signalled that it may consider paying the EU to attain preferential access to the European Single Market and may offer to pay liabilities on a moral and co-operative basis, even if not legally obliged to do so, to secure a preferential working relationship with the EU. In March 2017 the Bruegel think tank estimated the UK would need to pay at least ‚Ç¨25.4 billion, but the method of calculation is debatable and their calculations using seven different methods produced estimates between ‚Ç¨30 and ‚Ç¨45 billion. Speaking on 20 April 2017, Antonio Tajani said it was too early to quantify the amount the UK would need to pay and that it was not a bill to leave the EU; it was money needed for farmers and small businesses. =House of Lords report= A March 2017 House of Lords report acknowledges that the EU may claim for (1) part of the current budget (which runs from 2014 to 2020) post March 2019, because it was approved by the UK, (2) part of the EU future commitments which amount to ‚Ç¨200 billion, and (3) a contribution if the UK is to continue with access to some EU programmes. The report concluded that the UK had no legal obligation to make \\"exit\\" payments to the EU if there was no post Brexit deal. Discussing financial and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget is funded by revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU's Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the European Union (Finance) Act 2015. The revenue includes contributions from import duties and VAT collected by member states. The report also mentions the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for controlling the annual expenditure. =Assets and liabilities= The EU has considerable assets including buildings, equipment and financial instruments, and there is a potential claim by the UK for a portion of these assets. Boris Johnson, the UK's Foreign Secretary, commenting on the Brexit \\"divorce bill\\" in May 2017, said the valuable EU assets the UK has paid for over the years should be properly valued, and that there were good arguments for including them in the negotiations. The Bank of England (BoE) has invested in the European Central Bank (ECB) amounting to 14.3374%, representing paid up capital of ‚Ç¨55.5 million. The BoE does not participate in any profits (or losses) of the ECB. The BoE has also made loans to the ECB. The ECB set up the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of ‚Ç¨440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the European Commission and the Budget of the European Union as collateral to borrow a further ‚Ç¨60bn. The UK withdrawal will affect the ECB. The EU has a pension liability of ‚Ç¨64 billion (which includes current and former British MEPs as well as current and former employees of the Institutions). The UK benefits from a rebate which reduces its contribution to the EU budget. The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020. =Position paper= The EU drafted an 11-page position paper setting out the essential principles for a financial settlement and the methodology for calculating the obligation but does not estimate the final obligation. On 11 December 2017, Theresa May confirmed that the UK and the EU had agreed \\"the scope of commitments, and methods for valuations and adjustments to those values.\\" The UK Government's estimate of the financial settlement in March 2019 is ¬£37.8 billion (‚Ç¨41.8 billion). UK citizens elsewhere in the EU and other EU citizens in the UK Concerns have been raised by UK citizens who live in other EU countries, and by citizens from those countries who live in the UK. In May 2017, Michel Barnier stated: \\"Currently around 3.2 million EU citizens work and live in the UK, and 1.2 million British citizens work and live in the EU.\\" Issues include rights of movement, citizenship, abode, education, social support and medical treatment, and the payment of pensions; and the extent to which these rights apply to family members. Considerations for UK citizens resident in an EU27 country include their rights to work or live in a different EU27 country. Beyond the 27 EU countries, workers have certain freedom of movement rights to/from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. \\"Associate citizenship\\", suggested by EU27 negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, would allow UK nationals to volunteer individually for EU citizenship, enabling them to continue to work and live on the continent. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, is not opposed to the idea. Antonio Tajani spoke after a meeting with Theresa May on 20 April 2017, saying \\"the issue of reciprocal EU citizen rights should be negotiated 'immediately' with a view to getting an agreement by the end of the year.\\" The European Commission published a position paper on \\"Essential Principles on Citizens' Rights\\" on 12 June 2017, proposing that current and future family members of European nationals in the UK would keep their rights to settle in their residence country at any time after Britain's withdrawal. Speaking in advance of publication of the paper, David Davis described the demands as \\"ridiculously high\\". The UK government published their policy paper \\"Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU\\" on 26 June. The policy paper proposed that EU citizens living in Britain will be required to apply for inclusion on a \\"settled status\\" register if they wish to remain in the country after Brexit. By the end of September 2017 progress had been made on several of the 60 points which became green, while 13 out of the 60 points remain red. Three points (points #14, #15, and #16 related to monitoring and CJEU) have to be addressed at governance level. Few points remain to be clarified (that is yellow). On this basis European parliament will have to assess if sufficient progress has been made. As of October 2018, UK residents in the EU have not yet had their fates decided on. On 16 October 2018, just before departing for the EU27‚ÄìUK summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking to the German parliament, asked \\"How do we treat the 100,000 British citizens in Germany on the day after Brexit if there is no deal?\\", without supplying an answer. =Implications= The general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost, but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate. The situation of a person acquiring EU citizenship when the UK joined the EU in 1973 compared to a person born in the UK after 1973 and was therefore born into EU citizenship, may differ. It may be necessary for the ECJ to rule on these issues. The ECJ ruled in a 2017 decision (Ch√°vez-V√≠lchez and others) that the third-country (non-EEA) national parent of a child with EU nationality may be entitled to a ‚Äòderivative right of residence‚Äô, even if the other parent were an EU national and were ‚Äúable and willing to assume sole responsibility for the primary day-to-day care of the child‚Äù. The ability of the other (EU-national) parent to care for the child would, nevertheless, be a ‚Äúrelevant factor‚Äù in assessing whether the third- country national parent should be granted residence. The Ch√°vez-V√≠lchez decision built upon the ECJ‚Äôs decision in Ruiz Zambrano, which gave a ‚Äòderivative right of residence‚Äô to a third-country national primary carer of a child with EU nationality. The Ch√°vez-V√≠lchez decision may have consequential effects for UK residents who have young children and wish to live in the EU27 territory post Brexit, but this remains to be tested. =Immigration and mobility= Until the UK effectively withdraws from the EU in 2019 or at another agreed date, the current system of free movement of labour between the EU27 and the UK remains in place. The report of the House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee on The Government's negotiating objectives, published in April 2017, proposed (paragraphs 20 and 123) that the future system for EU migration should meet the needs of different sectors of the UK economy, including those employing scientists, bankers, vets, care workers, health service professionals and seasonal agriculture workers. Theresa May, answering press questions on 5 April 2017, commented that the free movement of labour would not end in March 2019; an implementation period of possibly five years would give business and government time to adjust. The UK currently charges an annual levy of up to ¬£1,000 for each non-EU citizen employed within the UK. Proposals are under consideration to increase this 'immigration skills charge' to ¬£2,000 p.a. and to implement a similar levy on EU citizens employed in the UK. According to an unconfirmed newspaper report, a leaked Home Office paper has a proposal that the UK will end the free movement of labour of low- skilled workers immediately after Brexit, focusing on highly skilled EU workers instead. The proposal would limit lower-skilled EU migrants' residency permits to a maximum of two years, and the implementation of a new immigration system ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants while placing tough restrictions on their rights to bring over family members. Those in \\"high-skilled occupations\\" could be given permission to work in the UK for a period of three to five years. Migration Immigration is one topic requiring partnership between EU and UK, as according to Theresa May, \\"Mass migration and terrorism are but two examples of the challenges to our shared European interests and values that we can only solve in partnership\\". In the context of Brexit, the question of migration might contain two subtopics: on one hand migrations between EU including UK and third countries which might be dealt with at a local level; and on the other hand migration between EU and UK once UK has become a third country which was discussed for the withdrawal agreement. European Court of Justice (ECJ) The concept of European Court of Justice competence creates complications. Some pro-Brexiteers believe the Court of Justice might be completely removed from the UK landscape. Various other opinions consider that the Court of Justice or some equivalent should be able to rule on remaining issues after Brexit (for instance between a European and a British stakeholder), at least in respect of the TEU (Treaty on European Union), European Union citizens, or access to the European Single Market. After the 2017 negotiations, in February 2018 the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community consider for instance that: * \\"The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period. That jurisdiction shall extend to all stages of proceedings, including appeal proceedings before the Court of Justice and proceedings before the General Court after a case has been referred back to it.\\" * \\"The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on requests from courts and tribunals of the United Kingdom referred to it before the end of the transition period.\\" Sectoral issues Documents setting out how the Brexit will affect parts of the British economy were set up for the government, \\"the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue\\" containing \\"excruciating detail\\" according to Brexit Secretary David Davis. The ministers were reluctant to publish them but in November 2017, a vote in Parliament allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions to avoid news leaks. They were released online on 21 December 2017 but lawmakers were unimpressed: \\"Most of this could be found on Wikipedia or with a quick Google search\\", said Labour's David Lammy, \\"these documents [were made] in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises.\\" =Trade= Without a trade agreement in place, UK trade with the EU would be governed by the World Trade Organization's Bali Package. This would lead to common tariffs and non-tariff barriers being imposed by the EU27 upon the UK's access to the European Single Market, because the Market is also a customs union. However, the UK would then have an opportunity to control immigration as well as develop its own trade regulations. The UK is not permitted to hold trade talks until after Brexit is concluded, however the UK can do preparatory work with other countries regarding the UK's future trading relationships; this is not to the liking of some EU27 countries. Before Britain leaves the EU, they may put trade agreements in place with non-EU countries. Only the EU can act in areas where it has exclusive competence, such as the customs union and common commercial policy. In those areas member states may not act independently. The UK can still negotiate its own bilateral investment protection treaties subject to Commission authorisation. Strategic controls on military goods are primarily a member state competence. As a result, member states themselves negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements on the strategic aspects of trade in defense goods. The EU27 wish to exclude the UK from sitting in on trade negotiations held by the EU during the period ending March 2019, seeing the UK as a competitor. Theresa May rejected this idea, saying \\"While we're members of the European Union we would expect our obligations but also our rights to be honoured in full.\\" Regional foods The Geographical indications and traditional specialties in the European Union, known as protected designation of origin (PDO) is applied internationally via bilateral agreements. Without an agreement with the EU27, UK producers of products such as the Cornish pasty, Scotch whisky and Jersey Royal potatoes are at risk of being copied. Fisheries The EU27 have stated that UK fish suppliers could lose tariff-free access to the continent unless EU countries have continued access to UK waters after Brexit. Agriculture The Irish agricultural sector is heavily dependent on UK markets for its exports. =Financial services= Banks Investment banks may want to have new or expanded offices up and running inside the EU27 bloc before the UK's departure in March 2019, with Frankfurt and Dublin the possible favourites. Ireland's investment arm, IDA Ireland, witnessed an increase in inquiries from London-based financial groups considering to open up on an office in Dublin by the end of 2016, mostly coming from North American companies. In May 2017, JP Morgan became the first major bank to officially choose Dublin to transfer some of its personnel and operations from its London office. Insurance Lloyd's of London has confirmed that it will open a subsidiary in Brussels, hoping to ensure continuation of continental business which currently generates 11% of its premiums. Asset management companies The situation may be different when it comes to the fund management industry, as British asset owners, notably UK pension funds, often constitute an incommensurate share of total turnover for German, French, Dutch and other Continental European asset managers. This imbalance could potentially give Britain some negotiating leverage e.g. power of retorsion in case the EU attempts to impose an abrupt cancellation of the mutually-binding obligations and advantages pertaining to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 (\\"fund passporting\\"). Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) shows that Stock exchanges The London Stock Exchange issued a warning over a proposal by the EU to allow euro-denominated transactions to be cleared only within the EU eurozone, claiming it would increase business costs by ‚Ç¨100bn over five years and isolate the euro capital market. =Security= The letter of 29 March 2017 giving the UK's notice of intention to withdraw from the EU stated \\"In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.\\" This was seen by some as a threat. On 31 March, Boris Johnson, the UK Foreign Secretary, confirmed that the \\"UK commitment to EU security is unconditional\\". The call by the United States to other members of NATO to increase their defence expenditure to the 2% of GDP level coincides in timing with Brexit. The UK is the second largest contributor to NATO defence, one of only five to meet the 2% level and one of only two EU members who have nuclear weapons. The possibility of a new Franco- German partnership to fill the vacuum left by Britain has been raised as a possibility and post Brexit an EU military headquarters, previously vetoed by the UK, may be created. The UK is fully committed to NATO. =Academic research= The UK government's negotiating policy when the negotiating period started on 29 March 2017 included remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation, and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners. British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies Location of the UK and the British Overseas Territories In the Great Repeal Bill white paper published on 30 March 2017, the UK government stated \\"The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU.\\" =Overseas territories= Robin Walker MP, a junior minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, is responsible for managing the relationship between the overseas territories and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27. Gibraltar Brexit raised issues around sovereignty for Gibraltar, the only British Overseas Territory in the EU. Gibraltarians voted to stay in the European Union by 96%. Spain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar; however, in 2002 Gibraltarians voted 99% to keep British sovereignty. The EU27 draft guidelines allow Spain a veto over any effect the Brexit agreement has as regards Gibraltar. The guidelines state: \\"After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.\\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez has called for joint U.K.-Spanish sovereignty over Gibraltar. He publicly warned that Spain would \\"veto\\" Brexit deal over the issue of Gibraltar. =Crown dependencies= The Crown dependencies are not part of either the UK or the EU. They have a unique constitutional relationship both with the UK and, as encapsulated in Protocol3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession, with the EU. They have no voting rights in EU or UK referendums or elections and no international voice, the UK government having the responsibility to act for the dependencies on foreign matters. Oliver Heald QC MP is responsible for managing the relationship between the Islands and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27. Possibility of an extended transitional period Most of the major UK political parties support the idea of a transition period for applying temporary trade arrangements after the end of the UK's membership of the EU. According to a speech by Michel Barnier in September 2017, the EU would have to define the conditions for a transitional period, if the UK requests one, and the transition period would be part of the Article 50 withdrawal agreement. =UK government's legal advice= Following an unprecedented vote on 4 December 2018, MPs ruled that the UK government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to provide to Parliament, the full legal advice it had been given on the effect of its proposed terms for withdrawal. The key point within the advice covered the legal effect of the \\"backstop\\" agreement governing Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the UK, in regard to the customs border between the EU and UK, and its implications for the Good Friday agreement which had led to the end of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and specifically, whether the UK would be certain of being able to leave the EU in a practical sense, under the draft proposals. The following day, the advice was published. The question asked was, \\"What is the legal effect of the UK agreeing to the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular its effect in conjunction with Articles5 and 184 of the main Withdrawal Agreement?\\" The advice given was that: :The Protocol is binding on the UK and EU [para 3], and anticipates a final future resolution of the border and customs issues being reached [para 5,12,13]. But \\"the Protocol is intended to subsist even when negotiations have clearly broken down\\" [para 16] and \\"In conclusion, the current drafting of the Protocol... does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement. This remains the case even if parties are still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement.\\" [para 30] \\"No-deal\\" as a negotiating position A No-deal Brexit would involve the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without any Free Trade Agreement and relying on the trading rules set by the World Trade Organization. The UK government has consistently said it will aim for the \\"best possible deal\\" but that \\"no deal is better than a bad deal\\". This position was restated in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election.Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2017. 18 May 2017. pp35-36. \\"The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK. But we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to getting the best deal for Britain.\\" In July 2017, Michel Barnier said that \\"a fair deal is better than no deal\\", because \\"In the case of Brexit, 'no deal' is a return to a distant past\\". In June 2017, a Parliamentary inquiry concluded that \\"the possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to justify planning for it. The Government has produced no evidence, either to this inquiry or in its White Paper, to indicate that it is giving the possibility of 'no deal' the level of consideration that it deserves, or is contemplating any serious contingency planning. This is all the more urgent if the Government is serious in its assertion that it will walk away from a 'bad' deal.\\" In September 2017, the BBC reported that there was little evidence of UK government preparations for a \\"No Deal\\" scenario: \\"our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal ‚Äì and the EU27 can surely see it.\\" Projections in 2017 and 2018 for a possible post- Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU While withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were in progress in 2017, Barnier, as the EU's chief negotiator, speaking in Rome to Committees of the Italian Parliament on 21 September, said a future trade deal with the United Kingdom is the trade deal which will be negotiated after sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal. Barnier commented that the EU will want to negotiate a future trade deal with the United Kingdom, because trade with the United Kingdom will continue. At the same time Barnier said \\"the future trade deal with the United Kingdom will be particular, as it will be less about building convergence, and more about controlling future divergence. This is key to establishing fair competition.\\" The United Kingdom's then prime minister, in a speech at the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence on 22 September 2017, proposed an economic partnership between the UK and the EU which respects both the freedoms and principles of the EU, and the wishes of the British people. At the same time she re-affirmed that after the UK leaves the EU a period of implementation would be in their mutual interest, to be agreed under Article 50 for a strictly time-limited period. The European parliament voted a Brexit resolution (the European Parliament resolution of 14 March 2018) on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship (2018/2573(RSP)) with 544 MEP against 110 (with 51 abstentions). The 14 page document states that an association agreement between EU and UK could be an adequate framework for the future. This resolution proposes that the agreement address four domains: trade, interior security, foreign and defense policy collaboration, and thematic cooperation (for instance for research and innovation). The resolution also urges the UK to present a clear position on all outstanding issues pertaining to its orderly withdrawal. In December 2018, then Secretary for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd suggested that a Norway-plus model‚Äì the membership of the European Economic Area (EEA)‚Äì could be an alternative if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected. Trade deal negotiation between the UK and EU, 2020 Beginning in March 2020, representatives of the UK and the EU commenced negotiations for a trade agreement to make trade easier than it would be without such a deal. The deal might cover (or eliminate) both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. During the Brexit negotiations in 2017, the two sides agreed that trade negotiation could only start after the UK's withdrawal, because such negotiations could not happen when the UK still has a veto right within the EU. For this and other reasons, a transition period after Brexit day was defined to allow those negotiations. This transition period started on the first February 2020, in accordance with the withdrawal agreement. The first deadline is the 31 December 2020, a deadline which can be extended for two years. The British government has declared that it will not apply for any such extension. In addition, it clarified the only kind of trade deal the UK is interested is in, if any, is a Canadian style trade deal, as documented in Barnier's \\"staircase\\" slide. , negotiations had reached deadlock but, the Financial Times reported, \\"afterwards both sides showed fresh signs of a willingness to compromise to get a deal\\". Nevertheless, the UK side continued to assert that it would not request (or accede to any EU request) to invoke extension clause that expired on 30 June 2020.

The project started as a mobile blind school in 2012. Tiffany Brar (visually impaired) herself, traveled through rural areas in public transport in search of blind people of all ages in rural areas in India, with the aim of bringing out of the four walls of their house, to which they are confined, and brings a new light to their eyes, which has nothing to do with their eye- sight.Jyothirgamaya Foundation holds Special consultative status with United Nations.  Jyothirgamaya, the word  Jyothirgamaya(‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§Æ‡§Ø) is a Sanskrit word which means leading to the light. The philosophy behind this concept of leading to a light, is to bring the blind who are confined within their homes, out and give them a healthy exposure to the outside world, and enlighten them in various fields, so that they may not be in a world of darkness, but become well informed productive citizens History Jyothirgamaya Foundation was first started as a mobile blind school, with the philosophy, that \\"if blind cannot go to school, let the school go to them\\" Tiffany Brar, traveled to rural areas with her white-cane in search of blind people. She was shocked to see the blind living in worse conditions, some of them not even able to use their limbs properly, simply on account of being blind, she provided guidance and counseling to parents who were full of despair, not knowing what to do. Tiffany went from house to house in public transport with her white cane seeking the blind and trying to rehabilitate them, integrate them, and bring them to the forefront of society.  Founder  Tiffany Brar, who became blind due to carelessness of doctor during her childhood, due to constant battles of discrimination and stigmatization on account of her disability, decided to attempt in making a small difference in the lives of her blind colleagues, and so with the knowledge she possessed she started the Jyothirgamaya Foundation to bring her community to the forefront.

Although aiming for the peaceful implementation of democracy in Syria, the party has generally sided and cooperated with the Ba'athist government since the 1990s. In course of the Syrian Civil War, the Assyrian Democratic Party has come to be closely affiliated with the Khabour Guards and Nattoreh. It is part of the Syrian Democratic Council of Rojava.  Ideology  Since its foundation, the Assyrian Democratic Party has been considered to be \\"overtly sectarian\\", regarding the Eastern Assyrians as the only \\"true\\" Assyrians while distrusting the Western Assyrians. Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, the party has however gradually broadened its aims and become more inclusive. In 2014 it began to work closely with other Assyrian and Christian denominations in the \\"General Authority of the Chaldean Syriac Assyrians\\", a committee whose stated aims also include ensuring social equality and more rights for all Christians of al-Hasakah Governorate. In 2017, the party declared that it wanted a new constitution for Syria that recognized all Assyrians as native people of Syria and granted them \\"cultural, administrative and other rights\\". The ADP also officially rejects partisanship and supports the peaceful implementation of democracy in Syria, and is social democratic according to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed. Nevertheless, the party has generally sided and cooperated with the Ba'athist government since the 1990s, and supported pro-government militias in the civil war. The ADP advocates the unity of Syria, though has begun to support plans for the country's federalization since 2017. By July 2018, an ADP member stated that the \\"federal model that was set up [in northern Syria] is satisfying as we feel sufficiently represented\\".  History  = Foundation and early years = The Assyrian Democratic Party was founded in 1978, when a splinter faction under Adam Homeh seceded from the Assyrian Democratic Organization (ADO). From its outset, the ADP understood itself as proponent of rights for the Eastern Assyrians as opposed to the Western Assyrians, who dominated the ADO. Over time, a strong rivalry developed between the pro- opposition ADO and the ADP, which shifted increasingly closer to the Ba'athist government in the 1990s. As result, the Assyrian Democratic Party came to present itself as the pro-government alternative to the ADO, and when taking part in various Syrian parliamentary elections, supported Assyrian candidates that were not strongly opposed to the rule of the al-Assad family. = Activities during the civil war = When the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2012, the ADP openly opposed the Syrian opposition, with some of its members even joining the government militias (Popular Committees) in Qamishli. The Assyrian Democratic Party also expressed support for the pro-government Sootoro. In late 2013, the ADP lamented that the Free Syrian Army had occupied the Assyrian villages in the Khabur valley, saying that even though the FSA fighters did not harass the locals, their presence caused the area to become a target for government attacks. This in turn forced the Assyrians to flee their homes. The ADP also protested against the declaration of the autonomous region \\"Rojava\\" by the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria around that time. Party president Ninos Isho stated in early 2014 that it is \\"not logical to have 30 percent of the population [the Kurds] in this area rule over the other 70 percent [the Arabs and Assyrians]\\", and that \\"the Kurdish political groups must accept real power-sharing\\". In September 2014, the Assyrian Democratic Party put up a shelter in Qamishli for Yazidis who had fled the Sinjar massacre, and distributed food, clothing and medicine to them. The party also participated in the formation of the \\"General Authority of the Chaldean Syriac Assyrians\\" in the next month. This committee aimed at strengthening the cooperation of the different Christian churches, parties and organizations in al-Hasakah Governorate, and ensuring the rights of all Christians in the region. Among the participants was also the pro-Kurdish Syriac Union Party. After the assassination of one of its commanders by the YPG, the Khabour Guards (a small Assyrian self-defense militia) broke their ties with the Syriac Union Party and aligned themselves with the ADP around mid-2015. In November 2015, the ADP issued a statement condemning purported human rights violations in Rojava by the governing Democratic Union Party (PYD). Despite this, the ADP joined the PYD-led Syrian Democratic Council one month later, with Wail M√Ærza serving as the party's representative in the assembly. In January 2017, the Assyrian Democratic Party reached a deal with the PYD, according to which the Khabour Guards and Nattoreh would become the sole security force for the Assyrian villages in the Khabur valley. In return, the Khabour Guards and Nattoreh joined the Syrian Democratic Forces, while the ADP agreed to support the PYD's federalism project for Syria. Nevertheless, the party continues to advocate \\"the unity of Syria, as a country and people\\". On 13 April, PYD forces officially handed over the valley's villages to the Khabour Guards and Nattoreh, though the YPG kept a military base near Tell Tamer. The Assyrian Democratic Party said that this was a first step towards establishing Assyrian self-administration in the Khabur valley. Party President Ninos Isho also stated during a meeting with Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov in April 2017 that the party wants a new Syrian constitution that grants self-determination, more rights and recognition as native people to the Syrian Assyrians. The Assyrian Democratic Party also took part in the Northern Syria regional elections in December 2017 as part of the PYD-led \\"Democratic Nation List\\". Party official Wail M√Ærza called the election \\"historical\\", and further said that such elections are what Assyrians \\"are striving for all over Syria\\". The ADP took part in the Sochi peace talks of January 2018. On 20 September 2018, the Assyrian Democratic Party announced the creation of a united military leadership for Nattoreh and the Khabour Guards, known as \\"General Command of the Assyrian Forces\\". The Khabour Guards already left the \\"Assyrian Forces\\" in the following December.

He is also a clinician-scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Framingham Study at the Boston University School of Medicine. The subject of his 2017 book, Mirror Touch: A Memoir of Synesthesia and the Secret Life of the Brain is a collection of patient case histories and his personal experience with multiple forms of synesthesia, including mirror-touch synesthesia.  Early life and education  Salinas was born in Miami Beach, Florida, to Nicaraguan immigrants granted political asylum during the Contra War of the Nicaraguan Revolution. He grew up in Miami, Florida with his younger brother and sister, though he spent a formative period in Managua, Nicaragua, after his parents declared bankruptcy under financial strain and temporarily returned to Nicaragua. He was recognized as the Miami-Dade County Student of the Year in 2000 and graduated valedictorian from Miami Southridge High School in 2001. Salinas earned his bachelor of arts magna cum laude in Biology and Society from Cornell University in 2005. While an undergraduate, he performed research in the Amazon rainforest of Par√°, Brazil, studying the methyl-mercury contamination and ethnography of the Gorotire Kayapo watershed, which he described in his honors thesis dissertation on the sociocultural influences that affect people‚Äôs response to health risks. Salinas graduated with a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in 2011. In 2006, while in medical school, a tumor over his right brain was discovered. When successfully resected, the tumor was discovered to be vascular. The tumor was fortunately also benign and its invasion was isolated to destroying the overlying skull bone. From 2008 to 2009, he spent a year as a Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellow in neuropsychiatric imaging at the University of Iowa‚Äôs Carver College of Medicine, where he suffered a devastating car accident. He also completed a joint MD-MBA program, earning a Master of Business Administration in Health Sector Policy and Management at the University of Miami Business School and winning the University of Miami Annual Business Plan Competition‚Äôs Grand Prize. Salinas completed his neurology residency at Harvard from 2011 to 2015, training at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital.

After the death of Murtadha al-Ansari, he was known to be the supreme Shia leader of his time, and gained fame for his celebrated 1891 verdict against the usage of tobacco in what became known as the Tobacco Protest in the Qajar era. He is dubbed as the mujaddid (renewer of the religion) of the 13th century of the Islamic era.  Early life and education  Born in Shiraz, to the renowned al-Shirazi family. HIs father was Mirza Mahmud Shirazi, and his mother was Khanum Musawi. His father died when he was young, and his maternal uncle, Sayyid Husayn Musawi‚Äìmajd al-ashraf‚Äìbecame his guardian. = Education = He began his religious education at the age of four, and completed his introductory studies by the time he was eight years old. He began his advanced classes in jurisprudence and methodology in the seminary of Shiraz. He studied at the religious seminary in Isfahan beginning in 1832, and was granted ijtihad in 1835. He then moved to Najaf in 1845, and studied under many senior scholars including Sheikh Muhammad-Ibrahim al-Karbassi, Sayyid Sadr al-Din al-Ameli, Sayyid Hassan al-Mudarris and Sheikh Muhammad-Hassan Najafi. He studied for a short while under Sayyid Ibrahim al-Qazwini, author of al-Dhawabit. Najafi equipped Shirazi with another certificate of ijtihad and a letter of recommendation to Hossein Khan Sardar, governor of Iran. Upon the death of al- Ansari in 1864, Shirazi was nominated the best qualified scholar to succeed him.  Tobacco Protest  Tobacco Protest verdict issued by Shirazi in 1891 Shirazi was considered the leading marja' of the Shia world, especially in Persia. This meant that he was in a position of huge influence, over the Shia community. Two scholars were involved in bringing what was happening in Iran to Shirazi's attention, one of them sent a letter, whilst the other sent one of his students to Samarra to explain matters to Shirazi in person. The protest started with Shirazi sending a telegram to Naser al-Din Shah on July 26, 1891, protesting the granting of the tobacco monopoly. Shirazi was left with no reply, however, the Shah sent his ambassador in Iraq to Shirazi to try and persuade him to abandon his motive, and that the deal was beneficial to the nation. After another attempt by Shirazi, that was also met with no response, a fatwa began to go around in Tehran, declaring that the use of tobacco to be tantamount to war against the Hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. Some doubts arose as to whether the fatwa was genuine, however this was quickly dismissed as there was no sign of any remarks of renunciation from Shirazi, upon the circulation of the fatwa. The case came to a close on January 26, 1892, when Naser al-Din yielded to the public pressure and cancelled the concession.  Ecumenical policy in Samarra  Shirazi's protest allowed Shiism to become more popular in Samarra. The Sunnis began participating in the mourning ceremonies of Muharram, with their Shia neighbours. Shirazi's demeanor also inspired them to pursue religious careers. Shirazi tried to use this advantage to strengthen ties between the Shias and Sunnis. His great-grandson, Radhi al-Shirazi narrates when the Sunnis decided to build a seminary for themselves, after reaching a specific stage, they had run out of funds to complete the construction. They then turned to Shirazi for financial aid, to which Shirazi gladly provided them a generous sum, that helped complete their seminary. Unfortunately, this level of influence gained by a Shia marja', wasn't going down well with Sultan Abdul Hamid II, who decided to establish more Sunni madrasas in Samarra to \\"protect the Sunnis from the tricks of the heretics [Shias]\\". In 1893, when chaos began to spread across Samarra due to sectarian tensions, leading to the death of Shirazi's son, Muhammad, as well as one of his nephews. Pressures rose on the Shia's, many Shias from the south were adamant on going to Samarra and violently ending the conflict, but were constantly rejected by Shirazi. Eventually, a complaint was made to the sultan, who allegedly worked hard to extinguish the conflict. However, the British and Russians both tried to take advantage of the situation and interfere, by deploying their powers to one side of the conflict, choosing Shirazi. But to their disappointment, Shirazi would rebuff them, claiming \\"it was a simple dispute among brothers\\" and of no concern to foreign powers.  Personal life  Shirazi was married to his cousin, the daughter of Mirza Radhi al-Din Shirazi. From her he had four children, two sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Muhammad, was killed in Samarra; reports indicate that his death was at the hands of the sectarian tension that happened at the time, and other reports, like that of his great grandson, Muhammad al-Shirazi's, claim he was killed by the British. His second son Ali, became a high ranking scholar, and if it wasn't for his death in 1936, he would have been the marja' of his time. His great grand-daughter is married to the current grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani.  Death  After facing a strenuous period after the tobacco protest, Shirazi died in Samarra on Wednesday February 20, 1895. He was then taken to Najaf to be buried in the Imam Ali shrine.  Legacy  Shirazi produced a large number of prominent students that proved to be great scholars of the age, and had a huge impact on the dissemination of the Islamic sciences. Some of them included: * Sheikh Muhammad-Kadhim al-Khurasani * Sayyid Muhammad-Kadhim al-Tabatabaei * Sheikh Muhammad-Husayn al-Naini * Sheikh Fadhlallah al-Nuri * Sheikh Muhammad-Taqi al-Shirazi * Sayyid Ismail al-Sadr. As the supreme marja' of his time, this left him very little time to attend to scholarly His duties as marja' did not leave him much time for publishing religious literature. He only had a few writings on the works of his mentor, al-Ansari. The role he played in the tobacco boycott has been dubbed a \\"stunning\\" demonstration of the power of the marja'-i taqlid, and the protest itself has been cited as one of the issues that led to the Constitutional Revolution a few years later.

The metro line will run parallel to the existing Main Suburban and Main Western railway lines, with the main aims of doubling rail capacity between the City Centre and Greater Western Sydney, and relieving overcrowding on the Western Line. The line will form part of the Sydney Metro network. Alignment , seven stations have been proposed for the line. *The Bays *Five Dock *Burwood North *North Strathfield *Sydney Olympic Park *Parramatta *Westmead Stations at Pyrmont and the Sydney CBD in the east are still being considered. The line will run via twin tunnels for its entire length. Project history Sydney Metro West geotechnical survey locations up to May 2018 The line was first mentioned in a discussion paper released in September 2016 that investigated new rail projects to service Western Sydney and the proposed Western Sydney Airport. Media reports indicated the project had found favour with Transport for NSW and the New South Wales Government. The line was announced by the Baird government as an official project on 14 November 2016. Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park, the Bays Precinct and the Sydney CBD were announced as initial station locations, with up to 12 stations being considered. The preferred alignment was scheduled to be announced in late 2018, while the line is expected to open in the second half of the 2020s. The government will use a value capture scheme to help pay for the project. The contributions from value capture are expected to amount to between 10 and 15 percent of the capital cost. Construction was originally planned to begin by 2022. During the state election campaign in March 2019, the Liberal/National coalition government announced a funding of $6.4 billion to the project and commitment to start construction earlier in 2020, if re-elected. The Labor opposition also announced its commitment to fund the project if it won the election, at the expense of cancelling other announced transport and road projects such as the Western Harbour Tunnel & Beaches Link. The coalition government was subsequently re-elected in the election that month. In June 2019, the 2019-2020 New South Wales state budget reaffirmed the government's commitment and funding of $6.4 billion over four years to the project, with construction to be fast-tracked to start in 2020. On 21 October 2019, the locations of seven stations were announced. Initial work is expected to start in 2020, with tunnelling to begin in 2022. The line is expected to open to the public by 2030. =Design= Planning When the project was first announced, up to 12 stations including Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park, the Bays Precinct and the Sydney central business district were announced as initial station locations. In March 2018, the government expanded the project scope, including: *an additional station at Westmead *a new station that will connect to existing stations either at Concord West or North Strathfield. *an interchange at the western end of the line, connecting with the existing railway stations at either Westmead or Parramatta Other options for new metro stations include Camellia/Rydalmere, North Burwood/Five Dock, Kings Bay (Five Dock) and Pyrmont. Media reports indicate that Martin Place will be the main CBD interchange. During the state election campaign in March 2019, the government announced new stations at Five Dock, North Burwood and North Strathfield. In October 2019, the locations of seven stations were announced: *Bays Precinct *Five Dock *Burwood North *North Strathfield *Sydney Olympic Park *Parramatta *Westmead At the time of announcement, the government was considering further stations at Pyrmont and Rydalmere. A stabling and maintenance facility and a service facility was also proposed to be built at Clyde, adjacent to the Auburn Maintenance Centre, and Silverwater respectively. The Clyde facility would be on the site of Sydney Speedway, which would be demolished, and would be accessed from the main tunnels via the former Carlingford railway line corridor.Sydney Speedway to be Demolished Auto Action 21 October 2019 On 30 April 2020, the project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was released to the public for exhibition. The Rydalmere station option was confirmed scrapped due to the cost of extra 3 kilometres of tunneling and the increase in commuter travel times. Parramatta City Council has also urged the government to build a station at Camellia to trigger urban renewal of the precinct. The Pyrmont station option continued to be considered by the government, with a decision to be made by the end of 2020. The station is likely to be close to The Star casino, and will likely involve an office and retail development above the station. Parramatta Light Rail The metro project serves a similar area to the Parramatta Light Rail, whose stage 1 alignment runs between Westmead and Carlingford. Stage 2 of the light rail project was initially deferred, then redesigned and truncated from Strathfield to Sydney Olympic Park via the suburbs to the north of the Parramatta River. Possible extensions The government have announced they will safeguard the ability to extend the eastern section of the line to the south-east via Zetland and Green Square, and also extend the western section beyond Westmead to areas such as the new Western Sydney Aerotropolis. =Construction= Tunnellling In August 2020, the government announced a shortlist of three consortia to deliver the project‚Äôs first two major tunnelling packages: *John Holland, CPB Contractors and Ghella Australia Joint Venture (JHCPBG JV) *Gamuda and Laing O‚ÄôRourke Australia Joint Venture (GALC JV) *Acciona Australia and Ferrovial Australia Joint Venture (AF JV) The three consortia would first bid for the Central Tunnelling Package to build 11 kilometres of twin tunnels between The Bays and Sydney Olympic Park. The remaining two consortia who were not successful would then bid for the Western Tunnelling Package to build 9 kilometres of twin tunnels between Sydney Olympic Park and Westmead. Tunnelling is expected to commence by the end of 2022. Associated works Works in The Bays is expected to start in late 2020. Past proposals In the 2000s, there were two previous proposals to link Sydney CBD to Western Sydney via a new alignment. The first of these was the Western Fast Rail which was proposed by a private consortium, linking Wynyard and Penrith stations. The second proposal was the West Metro, first announced by Premier Morris Iemma in 2008 as a possible future route in the Metro Link proposal. The proposal was carried forward to the Sydney Metro project announced by Iemma's successor Nathan Rees in 2009. It is important to note that the Sydney Metro project is a different and separate project to the current Sydney Metro, which was first proposed by the new Liberal government in 2011. =Western FastRail= Concept art for the proposed Western FastRail Western FastRail was a proposed $2 billion privately-funded underground and above-ground train line that would link central Sydney with Western Sydney independent from the CityRail network. Western FastRail was being backed by a consortium led by businessman and former union leader Michael Easson, which includes Dutch bank ABN AMRO and Australian construction company Leighton Holdings. The project was prompted by congestion on Sydney's westbound trains and roads, the growing importance of Parramatta as a business centre, higher petrol prices, public opposition to tolled roads and environmental concerns. An unreleased government document leaked to The Daily Telegraph suggests that such a train would eliminate the need of around 18 million car trips per year, reducing between 34,000 and 45,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions being put into the atmosphere. The proposal was first made on 11 April 2002 when Col Gellatly, the state's top civil servant and director-general of the Department of Premier convened a meeting of Treasury secretary, John Pierce, the Transport NSW director-general, Michael Deegan, and the State Rail Authority chief executive, Howard Lacy. Before them consortium leader Michael Easson made a presentation for a privately financed rail line linking Sydney's far west with the city. For a $8 return toll on top of the normal fare, trains travelling at 160 km/h could carry up to 16,000 commuters an hour to the city in 28 minutes, taking 11 minutes from Parramatta to the city. The proposal depended on the construction of two tracks from St Marys to Penrith, as well as taking over existing CityRail tracks between St Marys to Westmead. Costed at $2 billion, it was deemed extraordinarily cheap, and in December 2003 the Government formally rejected the unsolicited proposal. In March 2005, the proposal was again brought up, and again in December 2006 by then federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd during a visit to Penrith should the Australian Labor Party win the 2007 Federal Election. The plan received approving comments by the NSW State Government.Hildebrand, J. Rudd's road and rail cash. Daily Telegraph 19 December 2006 In September 2007 the proposal was again shown to the NSW Government. Under the proposal, the project is proposed to be funded by the private sector, with Fastrail‚Äôs assets being returned to the NSW Government after 30 years.Leighton Contractors Infrastructure Investment: Western FastRail On 18 March 2008, the NSW State Government announced SydneyLink, which included plans for the West Metro. Premier Morris Iemma was asked about the Western FastRail proposal, and said that \\"the proposal on Penrith has got to stack up,\\" and \\"the work that has been done shows that it does not stack up, for a number of reasons.\\" On 25 August, the State Government made a public announcement that it had ruled out the project two weeks earlier due to cost concerns, with the head of the consortium saying that the Government has failed to adequately review the proposal. Proposed Alignment It was proposed that two 26 km tunnels will link Sydney (possibly Wynyard station or a new nearby station to be built as part of MetroPitt) with Parramatta, with high-speed trains traversing across the distance in eleven minutes at speeds of up to 160 km/h. The line would continue above-ground to Blacktown in six minutes, and onwards to Penrith in a further eleven minutes. At the time, journeys on existing CityRail lines take up to three times as long. There were 10 stations proposed for the Western FastRail:Western FastRail * Wynyard *Metro West (new station) * Central * Olympic Park (possible new station) * Parramatta * Seven Hills * Blacktown * Mount Druitt * St Marys * Penrith =West Metro= The SydneyLink project was a massive infrastructure scheme announced by the state government led by premier Morris Iemma on 18 March 2008. The centrepiece of the scheme was \\"Metro Link\\", a future rapid transit system of underground, privately operated, single-deck, automated trains. One of the possible future metro lines was the West Metro, from the Sydney CBD to Parramatta and Westmead. After Nathan Rees replaced Iemma later that year, the West Metro was incorporated into Rees's Sydney Metro project, announced in 2009. The West Metro would be the second stage 2 of the project, and would extend CBD Metro (stage 1 - Central to Rozelle) from Central westward to Olympic Park. Stage 5 of the project would further extend the line westward from Olympic Park to Parramatta, planned for completion in 2024. Rees' Sydney Metro project was cancelled in February 2010 by the government led by newly-appointed premier Kristina Keneally. Keneally said \\"We've listened to the community and made a tough decision,\\" and pledging to reimburse tenderers and property owners for losses incurred as a result of the work that had occurred to that point. Keneally announced a $50 billion transport plan to replace the metro project, including a new heavy rail line under the CBD. Legislation to remove references to the Sydney Metro Authority was enacted later that year. Keneally's altnernative was the CBD Relief Line, which would be heavy-rail bypass of the existing city-centre stations.Keneally unveils transport blueprint ABC News 21 January 2010. Keneally lost office just over a year later in the 2011 New South Wales state election, and the relief line was cancelled by the incoming government led by premier Barry O'Farrell.Saulwick, J. No rail plans for Barangaroo's commuters, Sydney Morning Herald, 16 June 2011. Criticism The metro line will pass through several suburbs that will not be serviced by the line. These include Rozelle, Leichhardt and Rosehill. Since the closure of the Carlingford railway line, none of these suburbs will be serviced by either metro or heavy rail once the metro is completed. The line will also pass through Pyrmont and Silverwater, which have only been noted as potential metro stops.

Equipment quay with engineering and dry dock in 1947. √ñresundsvarvet was a Swedish shipyard in Landskrona that was established in 1915 and largely phased out between 1980 and 1982. Foundation √ñresundsvarvet was constituted on 16 December 1915 by Gothenburg shipbuilder, Arthur Du Rietz. During a visit to Landskrona, Du Rietz heard that the city wanted to complement its industry with a shipyard. The authorities suggested an area alongside the harbor called Sydpiren, which was then under water. Du Rietz was contracted to build a shipyard with two slipways on a plot, above sea level. The city committed to provide a long railway embankment and a berth. Du Rietz pledged to immediately then build a shipyard with two slipways. Construction began in 1916 and included a large dry dock in length. As World War One wasn't resolved in \\"a few months\\" (which was the general assumption by most people in the summer of 1914), there was a period of an increasing demand, both for more vessels in general, as well as an equal demand of more modern ships. By November 1918, √ñresundsvarvet was already more than well ready to continue delivering various kinds of vessels. But after the 1918 Armistice, which ended the war, the number of ordered ships began to decrease. Despite this decrease, the shipyard survived and better times was to come. MS Trelleborg Growth The shipyard was opened on 21 September 1918 with the launch of the first ship, the steamer Torild, built by Rederi AB Percivald in Landskrona. The company expanded quickly and by Autumn 1920 the yard had grown to with a long fit-out in of water. In 1922, the shipyard could build eleven new vessels of , but it was declared bankrupt due to poor economic conditions. New Oresund Shipbuilding Company () was formed in April 1923 which could build seven vessels of deadweight. In 1935, the company name was changed to √ñresundsvarvet AB. A floating dock for vessels up to was purchased from Copenhagen in 1936. The shipyard was taken over in 1940 by G√∂taverken, who then supplied the shipyard's newbuildings with new machinery. During World War II, the yard built a coastal destroyer and two minesweepers. In all, during the period from 1931 to 1944 the shipyard built fifty ships totalling . The yard experienced post-war economic growth and had expanded by 1975 to 3,500 employees. In 1972, it built one of the world's largest container ships Nihon for the Swedish East Asiatic Company. Closure After the 1973 energy & oil crisis, the demand for new oil tankers rapidly decrease World Wide. As such vessels had been a major product for most shipyards during 15-20 years prior to 1973, did the aftermath of this enormous crisis (as OPEC nearly quadrupled the oil price in dollars, in a response to US President Nixon's aid to Israel during the Yom Kippur Warhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil_shock_of_1973_74) include a severe crisis for most larger shipyards, also in Sweden. √ñresundsvarvet was taken over by the state-owned shipbuilding group Svenska Varv AB in 1977. The last ship, building number 282, was delivered in 1982. The shipyard was sold in December 1982 for 1 krona to Landskrona Finance. Subsequent activities Smaller activities continued in the area after the yard closed. A new repair yard named Cityvarvet AB took over about 200 employees, while a similar number joined Bruces Shipyard making hulls.

The first student to graduate as an illustrator from the Danish Design School in 1972, she has become one of the country's most productive illustrative artists, gaining popularity in particular for her children's books. Biography Born on 27 January 1950 in Nordby on the Danish island of Fan√∏, Br√∏gger was brought up in Copenhagen where she studied at the Danish Design School from 1967 to 1972. The first work with her illustrations, the 25-page book for small children, Der hvor Linda bor (The Place Where Linda Lives), was published in 1975. She has since illustrated over a hundred books in a variety of unconventional styles. She is generally regarded as a post- modern illustrator who breaks the rules of proportion and representation. She varies her techniques with each new book, always careful to create images which appeal to children. In 2002, Br√∏gger received the H.C. Andersen award for her illustrations in Hj√∏rdis Varmer's biography of Hans Christian Andersen Den fattige dreng fra Odense (The Poor Boy from Odense). It took her more than half a year to create some 100 illustrations consisting of collages, cuttings and drawings, inspired by Andersen's own approach to art. As a result, she became the first illustrator to receive the Danish Writers' Association's H.C. Andersen prize (Dansk Forfatterforenings H.C. Andersen Legat) since it was established in the mid-1950s. More recently, Br√∏gger has received the Forening for Boghaandv√¶rks √Ürespris (2009) awarded to the person who has contributed most to book development, and Kulturministeriets Illustratorpris (2010) awarded by the Danish Minister of Culture to the artist whose illustrations have most enhanced the written word.

The Regal was also the site of theatrical premiere of Bollywood and Hollywood films. The Academy Award- winning Gone with the Wind had its Indian premiere at the Regal in 1940. Films involving Raj Kapoor and Nargis also made its premiere at the theatre. The Regal was the first in Connaught Place to screen Hindi films and fared on its own against competitors, such as the Chanakya which was established in the 1970s. The opening of the PVR Anupam, a four-screen multiplex marked the decline of the theater. As multiplexes started to gain widespread reception in the 2000s, the Regal Theatre resorted to screening B-grade Bollywood films to stay operational. On the last day of the theatre's operation on 30 March 2017, the Raj Kapoor-directed films Mera Naam Joker and Sangam were screened. The owner of the cinema plans to open a multiplex in its place. Building The building of the theatre, the Regal Building, was built in 1932. It was designed by architect Walter Sykes George. and has three floors. In 1996, the first and second floors above the ground floor were sold to Madame Tussauds to open a wax museum in the building.

As a two-year-old in 1975 he won twice, finished second six times and third once from nine races, showing consistent form but appearing to be some way short of top class. In the following spring he was beaten in his first four races before recording an upset win in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He continued his improvement when moved up in distance, winning the Blandford Stakes and finishing third in both the Irish Derby and the Champion Stakes. After his retirement from racing he was exported to stand as a breeding stallion in Australia. Background Northern Treasure was a chestnut horse with a white star bred in Ireland by Tim Rogers and C. G. St Lawrence. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold for 3,100 guineas. He entered the ownership of A. D. Brennan and was sent into training with Kevin Prendergast. He was sired by Northfields, an American horse whose biggest win came in the Louisiana Derby in 1971, before spending most of his stud career in Europe. His other winners included Northjet, Oats, North Stoke and No Pass No Sale (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). He was the second foal of his dam Place d'Etoile, a high-class racemare who won the Pretty Polly Stakes in 1970. Her dam Etoile de Paris was an influential broodmare whose descendants have included Dubawi, High-Rise, In The Wings and Virginia Waters. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= Northern Treasure began his racing career in April 1975 and failed to win in his first five races although he showed very consistent form, finishing second four times and third once. On his sixth appearance he contested a maiden race over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in August and recorded his first victory, beating Poacher's Moon by four lengths. On his next appearance he was stepped up in distance and won a nursery (a handicap for two-year-olds) over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. In his last two races of the year ran in nurseries and finished second over five furlongs at Leopardstown in September and over six furlongs at Naas in October. =1976: three-year-old season= Northern Treasure began his second campaign by finishing third over five furlongs and then ran third behind the top weight Northern View in the Madrid Free Handicap at the Curragh in April, beaten more than five lengths by the winner. Later that month he was moved up to Group Three class for the Vauxhall Trial Stakes at Phoenix Park and finished fourth behind Lucky Wednesday, Sovereign Dice and Wolverlife. Despite a defeat over six furlongs on his net appearance, Northern Treasure was then moved up to the highest class for the Group One Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 15 May, in which he was ridden by Gabriel Curran and started a 33/1 outsider in a seventeen-runner field. The French colt Comeram (second in the Grand Crit√©rium and third in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains) started favourite ahead of the Italian challenger Northern Spring (Gran Criterium) and the main English hope Patris (fourth in the 2000 Guineas) while the other runners included Northern View, Lucky Wednesday, Wolverlife and Poacher's Moon. The field was tightly grouped for most of the way and there was a considerable amount of barging and scrimmaging for position but in the last quarter mile the contest devolved into a three-way struggle between Lucky Wednesday on the rail, Northern Treasure on the outside and Comeram (partnered by Lester Piggott) racing between his two rivals. In a closely contested finish the outsider prevailed over the favourite as Northern Treasure won by a short head from Comeram, with the weakening Lucky Wednesday a length behind in third place. On 26 June Northern Treasure was moved up in distance to contest the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh and started the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. He proved the best of the British and Irish challengers as he finished third of the seventeen runners behind the French- trained colts Malacate and Empery. He was dropped in class for the Group Three Blandford Stakes over the same course and distance in August and won easily from his stable companion Whistling Deer. In the inaugural running of the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes at Leopardstown on 25 September he started second favourite but failed to reproduce his best form as he finished fourth behind Malacate, Mart Lane and Niebo. On his final racecourse appearance he was sent to England for the Champion Stakesover ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Ridden by Brian Taylor, he produced what was arguably his best performance as he finished third behind Vitiges and Rose Bowl, with Malacate, Crow and Wollow finishing behind. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. Northern Treasure was given a weight of 116 in the Irish Free Handicap, thirteen pounds behind the top-rated Malinowski. The independent Timeform organisation, in their annual Racehorses of 1975 gave him a rating of 107, 23 pounds behind their best two-year-old colt Manado. In 1976 he was rated 126 by Timeform, nine pounds behind their top three-year-old Youth. Stud record In August 1976 Northern Treasure was purchased privately the bloodstock agency BBA (Ireland). At the end of his racing career he was exported to Australia and began his career as a breeding stallion at the Newhaven Park Stud in New South Wales. The best of his offspring included Northern Reward (Phar Lap Stakes, Villiers Stakes), Chinese Treasure (Black Opal Stakes) and Bullion Broker (Caulfield Sprint).  Pedigree  *Northern Treasure was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Nearco, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generations of his pedigree.

From the records it shows that the first to use the botanical name of \\"Bellflower\\" was the Belgian naturalist Rembert Dodoens, who lived between 1517 and 1585. This name was still in use for some time, although modified, in many European languages. In fact, in these plants they were archaic French \\"Campanelles\\" calls (today we say \\"Campanules\\" or \\"Clochettes\\"), while in German are called \\"Glockenblumen\\" and in English \\"Bell-flower\\" or \\"Blue-bell\\". In Italian they are called \\"bells\\". All these forms that derive from the Latin language course. The specific name (alpestris) refers the typical habitats of these plants; in particular it refers to the lowest mountain areas where the vegetation is influenced by the foothills. The scientific name of the species was defined for the first time by the Italian botanist and physician Carlo Ludovico Allioni (Turin, September 23, 1728 - Turin, July 30, 1804) in the publication Auctarium ad Synopsim Methodicam Stirpium Horti Reg.

They form part of Maddox's redevelopment of the centre of Monmouth and stand opposite his Market Hall. The architectural historian John Newman has written that Maddox's work \\"gives Monmouth its particular architectural flavour,\\" and considers Priory Street to be \\"his greatest work.\\" History In the early 19th century, the main thoroughfare out of Monmouth towards London was Church Street, a relatively narrow street now pedestrianised. Increasing traffic on the street led to a number of accidents and demands for the construction of a new road. At the same time, developments at the Shire Hall in Agincourt Square meant that the market, previously located there, required new accommodation. In 1834, the Town Council offered a prize for a redevelopment scheme, which was won by George Vaughan Maddox. Maddox, the son of another Monmouthshire architect, John Maddox, had already established a reputation within the town. Maddox's proposals envisaged a new road, described by John Newman as \\"a remarkably early inner bypass\\", that would run north of Church Street along the west bank of the River Monnow. Above the embankment side would stand slaughterhouses, supporting the new Market Hall, and facing the Hall, a row of grand residential houses, backing on to Swan Court. The road was called Priory Street, as its course ran next to Monmouth Priory on the route from the centre of the town. Architecture and description Numbers 1‚Äì6 Priory Street form a curved, symmetrical frontage at the beginning of Priory Street as it runs north-east from Agincourt Square. The whole block is of three storeys and nineteen bays. The frontage is stuccoed, and decorated with pilasters, typical of Maddox's \\"good facades.\\" The roofline has a central attic, under a pediment and lit by a shallow window. The composite grouping has been designated a Grade II* listed building for \\"its exceptional architectural interest as part of an important piece of early 19th century town planning.\\" Notes Sources  History of Monmouth, Wales Buildings and structures in Monmouth, Wales Tourist attractions in Monmouthshire Grade II* listed buildings in Monmouthshire ","title":"1‚Äì6 Priory Street, Monmouth"},{"id":"53658238","title":"Something's Going On (Trace Adkins album)"},{"id":"53658262","title":"Craving You"},{"id":"53658272","text":"Dorota Chylak (born 14 November 1966) is a Polish swimmer.

It is in the Amazon biome. It encompasses an upland region with diverse fauna and flora, which contains dramatic tepuis, or sandstone table mountains. The region has been inaccessible in the past and is generally fairly intact, apart from the north and northeast where large scale agriculture, ranching and mining operations are steadily encroaching on the ecosystem. New roads are opening the interior to logging, and planned dams will have a drastic impact on the riparian zones. Location The ecoregion includes parts of southern Venezuela, western and southern Guyana and northern Brazil, with scattered portions in Suriname and French Guiana. It extends into eastern Colombia. It has a total area of . The ecoregion lies on the Guiana Shield, an ancient upland area between the Amazon and Orinoco basins. It is surrounded by lowland grassy savannas and lowland forest. All areas of the ecoregion contains enclaves of the Pantepuis ecoregion on the tops of table mountains. Most areas of the ecoregion in the east are surrounded by the Guianan moist forests ecoregion, and most areas in the west are surrounded by the Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests ecoregion. Sections of the ecoregion in the east border the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests to the south. The central part of the ecoregion surrounds the northern part of the largest section of the Guianan savanna ecoregion The southwestern part of the ecoregion rises above the Negro-Branco moist forests ecoregion. The Guayanan Highlands moist forests and the Tepuis together make up the Guayanan Highlands Forests Global 200 ecoregion. Physical The terrain is rugged, with elevations in the ecoregion from above sea level. Taller table mountains in the region rise to elevations of and host the Tepui ecoregion. The Guayanan Highlands ecoregion is an \\"island\\" of higher land surrounded by lower grasslands and forests. Most of the land drains into the Orinoco through the Ventuari, Caron√≠, Paragua and Caura rivers in Venezuela. In the south, it is drained by the Uraricoera and Branco rivers in Brazil into the Amazon. The upland terraces and mountains consist mainly of quartzitic or sandstone rocks, with granitic rock in some areas. The lowland plains are recent, formerly flooded by lakes or by the sea. Most of the landscape is forest-covered rolling peneplains and floodplains. The undulating peneplains between the Caura and Paragua rivers hold low hills up to high. There are scattered upland areas of undulating plains, rounded hills, low mountains and Tepuis up to high, and the lower slopes of the higher tepuis. Soils are mostly sandy and low in nutrients. Ecology The Guianan Highlands moist forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. Yearly average temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of , with a mean of . Annual rainfall varies considerably, but in some areas averages . Monthly rainfall is lowest in January at and highest in July at . =Flora= There are various habitats including large areas of tall primary rainforest, open savannas and gallery forests. The peneplains hold evergreen forests with dense canopies of with emergent trees in the Calophyllum, Anacardium, Manilkara, Protium, Inga, Parkia, Copaifera, Erythrina and Dipteryx genera. Common trees on the plains include Micropholis melinoniana, Dacryodes species, Euterpe precatoria and Quassia cedron. There are fewer emergent trees in the hilly areas, where tree species include Newtonia suaveolens, Couratari guanensis, Alexa species, Euterpe precatoria and Micrandra minor. The seasonally flooded forests along the rivers have similar formations of flora to the Amazon region. Common tree species on the upper Orinoco include Combretum frangulifolium, Gustavia augusta, Pterocarpus species, Etaballia dubia, Albizia corymbosa, Spondias mombin, Mabea nitida, Eschweilera tenuifolia, Astrocaryum aculeatum and Inga species. Floodplain trees include Caryocar microcarpum, Caraipa densifolia, Macrolobium acaciaefolium, Abuta grandfolia and Panopsis rubescens. =Fauna= The black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) is endangered. 209 species of mammals have been recorded, including jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), brocket deer (Mazama genus), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris), lutrine opossum (Lutreolina crassicaudata), Robinson's mouse opossum (Marmosa robinsoni), Davy's naked-backed bat (Pteronotus davyi), Fernandez's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina fernandezi), highland yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira ludovici), eastern lowland olingo (Bassaricyon alleni), fiery squirrel (Sciurus flammifer), Guyanan spiny rat (Proechimys hoplomyoides) and Orinoco agouti (Dasyprocta guamara). Endangered mammals include black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), Fernandez's sword- nosed bat (Lonchorhina fernandezi) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). Snakes include fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis genus), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta). There are many green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis genus). Endangered amphibians include the demonic poison frog (Minyobates steyermarki). 631 species of birds have been recorded, including white-cheeked pintail (Anas bahamensis), aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis), brown-throated parakeet (Eupsittula pertinax), pavonine cuckoo (Dromococcyx pavoninus), Middle American screech owl (Megascops guatemalae), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), emeralds and hummingbirds in the Amazilia genus, chestnut-tipped toucanet (Aulacorhynchus derbianus), smoke-colored pewee (Contopus fumigatus), orange-crowned oriole (Icterus auricapillus), grey seedeater (Sporophila intermedia), two-banded warbler (Myiothlypis bivittata) and black-backed water tyrant (Fluvicola albiventer). Endangered birds include the yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". The interior forests have been inaccessible in the past and are generally intact, although roads are being built that open them up to logging. Logging is illegal in the state of Amazonas, Venezuela, but continues elsewhere. Legal and illegal mining for gold, diamonds, bauxite, and iron ore are a serious threat. Near urban centers in the north and northeast of the ecoregion the habitat is steadily being destroyed by large-scale agriculture, cattle ranching and mining. Planned hydroelectric dams on the Caroni and Paragua rivers would huge areas with devastating effect on the riparian habitats.

Life Mauritius Vogt Vogt was born in Bad K√∂nigshofen, Bavaria. As a child he came with his father, a geodesist, to a monastery in Plasy in Western Bohemia. He was educated there, before studying Philosophy and Theology at Charles University in Prague. After graduating, he returned to Plasy and joined the order in 1692, taking the monastic name Mauritius. He was ordained as a priest in 1698. Apart from occasional trips to Italy and Germany to study music, and temporary stays at the residences of his aristocratic supporters, most of his later life is closely connected with the monastery in Plasy and its surroundings. His main focus while at the monastery was music; he was the organist and music director of the monastery, as well as a composer. In 1724 he was appointed Superior at Mari√°nsk√° T√Ωnice, a pilgrimage church connected to the monastery, and he held this position until his death. Works Vogt‚Äôs first published and most famous work entitled Das jetzlebende K√∂nigreich B√∂hmen, an introduction to the geography and history of Bohemia, was printed in 1712 in Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig. The book became celebrated especially for its copperplate illustrations, maps and plans. It includes a total of 45 engravings depicting views and ground plans of Bohemian towns, castles, and monasteries, as well as a large detailed map of Bohemia. This highly valued map was added to the book as a separate supplement, and is thus rarely found in volumes today. Das jetzlebende K√∂nigreich B√∂hmen contains an engraving depicting Roudnice, the seat of the Lobkowicz family, in the early 18th century, including the ruined bridge over the Elbe river. The original Gothic bridge constructed in 1333‚Äì1340 (one of the first stone bridges built in Bohemia) was first damaged by the Army of the Czech Estates shortly after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 and then completely demolished by Swedish troops in 1634. Though there was a plan to reconstruct the bridge over the river during the radical rebuilding of the castle and the town under V√°clav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz in the late 17th century, a new bridge over the river was constructed only in 1910. Among the engravings included in the book is a view of the capital Prague, divided into two parts. The first copperplate presents the Prague Castle, Lesser Town and Charles Bridge, while the second part depicts a view over the river Vltava toward the Old Town, New Town and the fort Vy≈°ehrad. The copperplates were engraved by a German engraver, Christoph Friedrich Krieger. An exhibition of Vogt's work was hosted at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague, until 31 May 2015.

The project, located on Hunter's Point south of the Anable Basin, is a joint project sponsored by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey (PANYNJ)http://www.panynj.gov/real-estate-development/queens-west.html and the Empire State Development Corporation (ESD). The Queens West Development Corporation (QWDC), a subsidiary of ESD, was established in 1992 to facilitate implementation of the approved development plan. History Hunters Point Library under construction The project on was first announced in 1983 when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a new development along Long Island City's underused industrial waterfront, much of it brownfield land. There were no specific proposals, but one plan would include 11 residential buildings with about 4,500 units on , as well as of state park land, a public library, two public schools, and of retail space. Legislation authorizing the development was passed in 1983 or 1984, but delays arose due to the need to purchase land from several owners, as well as the fact that roughly a quarter of the proposed development was underwater. The Empire State Development Corporation joined the project in 1989, by which time the Port Authority had only purchased about a third of the necessary land. The proposals for the Long Island City waterfront development changed during the planning process. By 1990, when the project was sent to the New York City government for review, the development was slated to contain 6,300 apartments, a hotel, office space, and a school spread across 15 buildings, as well as of open space. About 80% of the space would be residential, and the rest would be commercial. The landmarked Pepsi-Cola sign The Queens West master plan ultimately called for three office towers, a hotel, apartments, and of waterfront space, which were to be developed incrementally. The project officially began construction in with the start of Hunters Point Community Park. The park was constructed first partially because developers wanted to convince the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide funding for the first apartment buildings, and HUD would only provide that funding if amenities were guaranteed for the apartments. Gantry Plaza State Park first opened in May 1998 and was expanded in July 2009. The Pepsi-Cola sign in Gantry Plaza State Park was made a New York City designated landmark in April 2016.

It may be either intentional or unintentional, and it may involve either public or private institutional policies. Such discrimination occurs when these policies have disproportionately negative effects on the opportunities of certain social groups. Some conceptualizations of structural discrimination focus on past forms of discrimination that have resulted in present-day inequality, while others focus on policies that still exist today and can have disproportionately negative effects on minority groups. One overt past example of structural discrimination was Jim Crow laws in the Southern United States, which were explicitly aimed at limiting the rights of black Americans in education, employment, and other areas of society.

After serving in the party apparatus of the state, S√°gv√°ri began her career at the Party History Institute and then became the director of the Budapest City Archives. In 1980, she was honored with the Ervin Szab√≥ Medal for her contributions as a librarian. From 1986 to 1998, she was the chair of the department on Administrative and Comparative History of the 20th Century at Budapest University. Early life √Ågnes S√°gv√°ri was born on 19 November 1928 in Budapest, Hungary to Erd≈ës Roz√°lia (n√©e S√°ndorn√©) and S√°ndor S√°gv√°ri; the original family name was Spitzer. She came from a middle-class, well-educated background. Of Jewish heritage, her father was a well-known lawyer and her mother was a teacher and the vice president of the Hungarian Jewish Women's Association. Her aunt, Jozefina S√°gv√°ri (formerly Spitzer) was the mother of the Hungarian scientist, Egon Orowan. She was the sister of the communist dissident, Endre S√°gv√°ri (hu). She attended a shorthand and typing school in M√≥ricz Zsigmond Square, completing her studies in 1944. Career After her studies, S√°gv√°ri worked in a factory between 1944 and 1945 and then became an administrator at the Hungarian Communist Party center beginning in 1945. At the same time, she joined the communist party and the Hungarian Democratic Youth League (), becoming a student organizer. In 1947, she went to work at the Hungarian State Police Department State Security (), and entered college to become a detective lieutenant. The following year, she joined the apparatus of the Hungarian Working People's Party working in the cadre department for the next eight years. During the same period, S√°gv√°ri was studying history and political economics at P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University and graduated in 1951. In 1956 she was appointed to the commissioner's office of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Central Committee and in 1960 was made a senior research fellow and deputy director of the Party History Institute. In 1962, she defended her PhD thesis Mass movements and political struggles in Budapest from 1945 to 1947. Two years later, in 1964, S√°gv√°ri became the senior fellow of the Institute of History for the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1968, she became a lecturer at the Department of Scientific Socialism at the J√≥zsef Attila University. Beginning in 1970, S√°gv√°ri joined the Budapest City Archives as its director until 1985. She immediately set out to organize the materials for the archive which had been neglected for some time. Because the old Town Hall building had insufficient space, and documents were located at various holding sites throughout the city, the first task was to collect them and organize them. S√°gv√°ri resumed the publishing efforts of the archive, and implemented bookbinding, filming and restoration efforts to preserve and safely maintain the records. In addition to writing and promoting the archive, she worked with the Association of Hungarian Librarians to create a series for the study of the city history. S√°gv√°ri was awarded the Ervin Szab√≥ Medal (hu), in recognition of her significant contributions as a librarian, in 1980. In 1986, she led the drive to create the Association of Hungarian Archivists. S√°gv√°ri began publishing works on Hungarian political history in 1945. Her early work was ideologically based, but to gain scientific recognition for her work, S√°gv√°ri increasingly moved away from politics and began work on the post-1945 history of Budapest. Using comparative urban history research, she gained insight into Hungary's history through a broader study of European history. Though an unpopular subject, she studied the Hungarian Holocaust and in the later period of her work evaluated the deportation of Hungarian Jews in Transcarpathia and looted Jewish property. After she left the Archives, S√°gv√°ri continued her career at Budapest University, serving as the chair of the department on Administrative and Comparative History of the 20th Century, until her retirement in 1998. Death and legacy S√°gv√°ri died on 13 June 2000 in Budapest. In 2001, she was one of the subjects of Margit Stolzenburg's work Women's Anger: Life stories of eleven unusual European women ().

It carries two tracks of the main railroad line between Hartford, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts. Built in 1867, it is one of the state's finest examples of a stone arch railroad bridge. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Farmington River Railroad Bridge is located north of the village center of Windsor, spanning the east-flowing Farmington River in a north-south direction, just north of Pleasant Street. It is a masonry structure long, built out of locally quarried sandstone, with seven arches mounted on piers and abutments of similar stone. The stone is formed into dressed rectangular blocks of varying sizes. The sides of the piers are articulated as pilasters, with a captstone set on a stone balustrade over each one. The upstream sides of the piers have triangular projections to minimize damage caused by ice floes. The bridge was built in 1867 by the Hartford and New Haven Railroad, and has carried the main line between Hartford and Springfield since then. This is particularly noteworthy, because the weight and force of modern trains is substantially greater than those at the time of its construction. The bridge was designed to allow for the transit of barges beneath it on the river.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film Trolls, directed by Walt Dohrn with co- direction by David P. Smith, produced by Gina Shay, and written by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, Elizabeth Tippet, Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky, from a story by Aibel and Berger.

Trolls World Tour was released in the United States in a limited amount of theaters on April 10, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it was also released for digital rental on the same day. It became successful by topping the digital renting charts, and its success led to Universal looking forward into doing more simultaneous theatrical and video-on-demand releases. AMC Theatres announced that they would no longer distribute the films of the studio, along with the confirmation that the release window of films are shortened.AMC bans Universal films from its theaters over Trolls World Tour CNN, April 29, 2020 AMC, largest cinema chain in US, announces boycott of Universal theguardian.com April 29, 2020 Universal and AMC are quarreling: What it says about Hollywood cnbc.com April 30, 2020 Plot Six Troll tribes represent the musical genres Pop, Funk, Classical, Techno, Country, and Rock. Each tribe keeps a magical string that powers their specific kind of music. Queen Barb of the Rock tribe summons all the tribes to a reunion, intending to steal the strings to unite the trolls under rock music. Queen Poppy takes their tribe's string and tries to unite the other trolls, bringing along Branch, who is seeking to express his feelings towards her, and Biggie, a stowaway who was tempted by cotton candy. En route to Volcano Rock City, the trio wind up in Lonesome Flats, the home of the Country trolls. After hearing how downbeat their music is, they try to cheer them up with a pop medley, but wind up in jail. Hickory, a smooth-talking Country troll, comes to their rescue and builds them a raft to take them to Volcano Rock City. On the way, they encounter Chaz, prompting Biggie to leave. Chaz is a Smooth Jazz troll bounty hunter sent by Barb to capture Poppy. Cooper embarks on a quest to find trolls like himself, but a spaceship beams him up. He learns he is a lost prince of the Funk trolls, raised by the Pop tribe. The spaceship beams up Poppy's group. Inside, the Funk trolls tell Poppy that the Pop Trolls tried to unite the others under their pop music, causing each tribe to separate. They tell Poppy that differences matter. The Rock trolls hijack the ship and steal the Funk string. Poppy is captured, and the Pop string is taken by Hickory, who was secretly a Yodel troll, with his brother and partner Dickory. Biggie urges the Pop trolls to save Poppy, as for Branch he was attacked by the Reggaeton and K-Pop trolls, who were about to fight each other, until Branch conviced them that their own music goes well together and they should work together to save all of music. Barb imprisons Poppy over a concert stage: the audience is captive trolls. With her six-string guitar, Barb turns the trolls into Rock zombies. Poppy is seemingly transformed but reveals she was wearing gumdrop earplugs. Poppy admonishes Barb and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, stopping the flow of music, and taking the trolls‚Äô colors with it. Her plan now foiled, Barb blames Poppy for destroying music and ruining everything. When Cooper hears his heartbeat and amplifies it over a microphone while his brother Prince D creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls join in with other forms of sound-making, thus reviving the power of their music. In song, Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of music are and encouraged by her father Thrash, the repentant Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and accepting Poppy's offer of friendship. Branch confesses his love to Poppy, who reciprocates. Back at the Pop village, everyone performs together, and all Trolls are finally reunited while celebrating their differences. Voice cast Production On February 28, 2017, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation announced a sequel to the 2016 film Trolls, with Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake reprising their roles as Poppy and Branch. In March 2017, podcasters the McElroy brothers began campaigning for roles in the film via a podcast titled \\"The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls World Tour\\". Following the campaign's success, DreamWorks confirmed in September 2018 that the McElroy brothers would make cameo appearances in World Tour. Sam Rockwell, Chance the Rapper, Anthony Ramos, Jamie Dornan and Flula Borg were added to the cast in May 2018. Corden, Icona Pop, Funches, and Nayyar returned to reprise their roles. On June 12, 2018, the film was retitled as Trolls World Tour. In October 2018, it was confirmed that Kelly Clarkson had joined the cast, and will perform an original song. In June 2019, along with promotional posters, new cast members have been announced, which include: J Balvin, Mary J. Blige, Rachel Bloom, George Clinton, Ester Dean and Gustavo Dudamel.

The Trolls World Tour: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on March 13, 2020. Release Universal Pictures had originally planned to release Trolls World Tour theatrically in the United States on April 10, 2020. It was later pushed up to February 14, 2020 before being pushed back to April 17, 2020. Following the delay of No Time to Die, it was once again pushed up to the original April 10 release date. It was also set to be released on March 20 in the United Kingdom, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, its release date was pushed back to April 6. On March 17, Universal announced that the film would be released simultaneously in theaters and for digital rental on April 10 in the United States and Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By then, Trolls World Tour had only been released in Russia, Singapore, and Malaysia. Other films distributed by the studio, such as The Invisible Man and The Hunt were also released digitally before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. As the pandemic receded, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020. Theatres in Hong Kong also started to show the film a week later on May 8, 2020. In Russia the film was made available in IMAX cinemas. In Austria and the Netherlands, it was released in both 4DX and Dolby Cinema. =Home media= Trolls World Tour was made available for an early digital purchase on June 23, 2020. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on July 7, 2020. All releases include an original short film entitled \\"Tiny Diamond Goes Back to School\\". By July 19, the film had totaled $23.6 million worth of DVD and Blu-ray sales. =Controversy= In response to Universal releasing the film without consulting theater owners, as well as comments from NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell suggesting that future Universal releases would premiere simultaneously in theaters, AMC Theatres stated that they would not license films that also premiere at the same time on digital release; \\"Going forward, AMC will not license any Universal movies in any of our 1,000 theatres globally on these terms.\\" Regal Cinemas followed suit in a statement not just directed at Universal, saying they will \\"we will not be showing movies that fail to respect the windows\\". In July 2020, AMC and Universal announced they had come to a deal to shorten the minimum theatrical window to 17 days (down from the usual 90), and that AMC would receive an undisclosed share of subsequent PVOD sales. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that some of the cast, including Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake, were not aware of the film's VOD release, and that their representatives were trying to secure the actors' bonuses they would have received had the film performed well theatrically. Reception =Box office= In the U.S., the film made about $60,000 in its opening weekend from 25 drive-in theaters, amid extensive movie theater closures due to restrictions targeted at the COVID-19 pandemic. By May 12, despite no official reports, it was estimated the film was approaching $1 million from theatrical grosses. By June 7, the film had amassed $3.6 million from the domestic box office, and likely had been the first place film every weekend since its release. It continued to play in drive-ins in the following weeks. , the film had grossed $19.9 million from international territories. =VOD sales= Following its debut digital streaming weekend, it was reported by FandangoNow that the film had set the record for most streams on a release weekend by the company. The film also finished number one for Amazon Prime, Comcast, Apple TV, Vudu, YouTube, and DirecTV, with Universal reporting it was purchased 10-times more than its previous day-one rental Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which had made $2‚Äì3 million on its first day. Altogether, the film made at least $40 million over the weekend. Through the first 19 days of release, it was estimated between three and five million people had streamed the film, resulting in about a $95 million gross ($77 million of which went to Universal, more revenue for the studio than the original film made during its entire theatrical run). After three months of release the film remained in the top-five across most services, and occasionally returned to the top spot on Amazon Prime, FandangoNow, and iTunes. By August, IndieWire estimated the film had made about $150 million from rentals. Deadline Hollywood estimated that due to the film's approximate $95 million production cost, plus another $30 million spent on marketing (although rival studios claim Universal spent more than that, as high as a normal $80‚Äì100 million campaign), the film could break-even if 9‚Äì12 million people rent the film, resulting in about $200 million in revenue. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \\"in the opinion of some industry veterans, [the film] may never make a dime\\" although \\"Universal believes it can make $40 million or more in profit from all revenue sources.\\" =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 6.15/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"A fun follow-up for fans of the original, Trolls World Tour offers a second helping of colorful animation, infectious energy, and sing-along songs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety magazine called it a \\"music-drenched fairy tale\\" and \\"for all its surface pleasures, it's a likable but underimagined one, with more enthusiasm than surprise and, at the same time, an overprogrammed sense of its own thematic destiny.\\" Notes References External links 2020 films Trolls (franchise) 2020 computer- animated films 2020 fantasy films 2020s American animated films 2020s animated films 2020s fantasy-comedy films 2020s musical comedy films American 3D films American children's animated comedy films American children's animated fantasy films American films American children's animated musical films American computer-animated films American fantasy-comedy films American musical comedy films American romantic comedy films American romantic musical films Animated films featuring female antagonists English- language films Films about trolls Films based on toys Jukebox musical films Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Films with screenplays by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger DreamWorks Animation animated films Universal Pictures animated films Universal Pictures films 2020s children's animated films Films about music and musicians Films set in 2020 ","title":"Trolls World Tour"},{"id":"53659545","text":"Nimgaon Mhalungi is a village located in the Shirur subdivision of Pune district, Maharashtra.

For nearly 20 years he was the cover artist for Interview Magazine.  Early life and education Bernstein was born on October 31, 1939, in New York City to a family with an older brother, David and younger sister, Ellen. His father, Herbert Bernstein, was a clothing manufacturer and his mother, Florence, was a homemaker. His mother first took him to the Museum of Modern Art children's school, where he saw works by Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, and other artists. Bernstein received a bachelor's degree in fine arts from the Pratt Institute and M.F.A. from Columbia University, studying with Richard Lindner.  Career  Bernstein's first exhibition was at the Iris Clert Gallery in Paris. His work was also presented at the Axiom Gallery in London, the Gallery Barozzi in Venice, the Gallery Monet in Amsterdam, and the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in New York City. His works are in several museum collections, including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., the Stejdlik Museum, Amsterdam, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. In the early 1960s, he moved into the Hotel Chelsea, where he lived until his death in 2002. In the late 1960s, he met Andy Warhol who had become an admirer of Richard Bernstein's art work.

For cantonal elections Geneva, her home canton and political base, introduced female suffrage as early as 1960, but at a national level Switzerland was more of a laggard, retaining male only voting for general elections till 1971. This meant that Bauer-Lagier was something of a trail blazer: women's rights featured strongly on her political agenda.  Life  Monique Lagier was born in Meyrin, then a farming village in the Canton of Geneva located a short distance to the north-west of the city. Jean and Th√©r√®se Lagier, her parents, were teachers. She underwent a classical education and passed her school leaving exams (Matura) in 1941. Being female she was not required to perform military service, instead going on directly to obtain a degree in Pedagogy from the Institute of Education Sciences (\\" Institut des sciences de l'√©ducation\\") in Geneva. After this she worked for eight years as a teacher. Her political career started with her election in 1973 to the Geneva cantonal parliament: she retained her seat till 1977. Meanwhile in 1975 she was elected to the National Council - effectively the lower house of the Swiss federal parliament. She switched to the upper house in 1979, remaining a member till 1987. She also became a member of the national committee of the Liberal Party. She supported women's rights and was a strong advocate for the new marriage law and for equal rights for men and women more broadly in government commissions. She focused on Minority rights, Ecological protection, a new economic world order internationally between north and south, and meaningful dialogue between east and west. She was chair of several organisations - a parliamentary group for refugees, the International Geneva Peace Institute, Swiss Aids Support, Bread for All and the International Union of Swiss language parliamentarians.

Infinite chess is any variation of the game of chess played on an unbounded chessboard. Versions of infinite chess have been introduced independently by multiple players, chess theorists, and mathematicians, both as a playable game and as a model for theoretical study. It has been found that even though the board is unbounded, there are ways in which a player can win the game in a finite number of moves. Background Taikyoku sh≈çgi (36√ó36 squares) Classical (FIDE) chess is played on an 8√ó8 board (64 squares). However, the history of chess includes variants of the game played on boards of various sizes. A predecessor game called Courier chess was played on a slightly larger 12√ó8 board (96 squares) in the 12th century, and continued to be played for at least six hundred years. Japanese chess (shogi) has been played historically on boards of various sizes; the largest is taikyoku sh≈çgi (\\"ultimate chess\\"). This chess-like game, which dates to the mid 16th century, was played on a 36√ó36 board (1296 squares). Each player starts with 402 pieces of 209 different types, and a well-played game would require several days of play, possibly requiring each player to make over a thousand moves.boardgamegeek/taikyoku-shogi boardgamegeek/taikyoku-shogi.chessvariants.com/taikyoku-shogi chessvariants.com/taikyoku-shogi.abstractstrategygames/ultimate-battle- chess.html abstractstrategygames/ultimate-battle-chess.history.chess.taishogi history.chess/taishogi.

An infinite chess scheme represented using ASCII characters. Numerous other chess players, chess theorists, and mathematicians who study game theory have conceived of variations of infinite chess, often with different objectives in mind. Chess players sometimes use the scheme simply to alter the strategy; since chess pieces, and in particular the king, cannot be trapped in corners on an infinite board, new patterns are required to form a checkmate. Theorists conceive of infinite chess variations to expand the theory of chess in general, or as a model to study other mathematical, economic, or game-playing strategies.\\"Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series\\" PBS Infinite Series.\\"A position in infinite chess with game value w^4\\" Transfinite game values in infinite chess, January 2017; A position in infinite chess with game value w^4, October 2015; An introduction to the theory of infinite games, with examples from infinite chess, November 2014; The theory of infinite games: how to play infinite chess and win, August 2014; and other academic papers by Joel Hamkins. Decidability of short mates For infinite chess, it has been found that the mate-in-n problem is decidable; that is, given a natural number n and a player to move and the positions (such as on \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}) of a finite number of chess pieces that are uniformly mobile and with constant and linear freedom, there is an algorithm that will answer if there is a forced checkmate in at most n moves. One such algorithm consists of expressing the instance as a sentence in Presburger arithmetic and using the decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic. However, the winning-position problem is not known to be decidable. In addition to the lack of an obvious upper bound on the smallest such n when there is a mate-in-n, there could also be positions for which there is a forced mate but no integer n such that there is a mate-in-n. For example, there could be a position such that after one move by black, the number of moves until black gets checkmated will equal the distance by which black moved whichever piece black moved.  guards are on (1,1),(8,1),(1,8),(8,8); hawks are on (‚àí2,‚àí6),(11,‚àí6),(‚àí2,15),(11,15); chancellors are on (0,1), (9,1), (0,8), (9,8) * Chess on an infinite plane: 76 pieces are played on an unbounded chessboard. The game uses orthodox chess pieces, plus guards, hawks, and chancellors. The absence of borders makes pieces effectively less powerful (as the king and other pieces cannot be trapped in corners), so the added material helps compensate for this.Chess on an infinite plane game rules. * Trappist-1: This variation uses the huygens, a chess piece that jumps prime numbers of squares, possibly preventing the game from ever being solved.Trappist-1 game rules.

They form part of Maddox's redevelopment of the centre of Monmouth and stand on Church Street, to the rear of Maddox's Priory Street. The architectural historian John Newman has written that Maddox's work \\"gives Monmouth its particular architectural flavour\\" and Cadw describes the grouping of 12‚Äì16 Church Street as \\"the best preserved early 19th century shopfront in Monmouth.\\" History In the early 19th century, the main thoroughfare out of Monmouth towards London was along Church Street, a relatively narrow street now pedestrianised. Increasing traffic on the street led to a number of accidents and demands for the construction of a new road. At the same time, developments at the Shire Hall in Agincourt Square meant that the market, previously located there, required new accommodation. In 1834, the Town Council offered a prize for a redevelopment scheme, which was won by George Vaughan Maddox. Maddox, the son of another Monmouthshire architect, John Maddox, had already established a reputation within the town. Maddox's proposals envisaged a new road, described by John Newman as, \\"a remarkably early inner bypass\\", that would run north of Church Street along the west bank of the River Monnow. This would allow the redevelopment of Church Street and here Maddox constructed the block comprising 12‚Äì16, with an entry into White Swan Court CADW is of the view that the building has probably held a dispensary since the time of its construction, a period of 180 years.

In its most popular and not highly intellectual slope, it only includes the description of the most apparent and colorist matter of the daily life. Appearing in prose and hardly ever in the verses, it reached its peak with the novel of manners and in the minor genre called custom picture in the journalism sector. In relation to the theater, by its own part, it created the comedy of manners and sainete,Theatrical gender that includes funny and popular topics a continuation of the earlier entrem√©s.Theatrical gender that includes funny and popular topics that can be written in prose or in verse.  History and origins  Categorized as a minor genre in the Spanish literature and the English literature of the 19th century, there are several precedents ‚àí3 along the history of the literature- that can be regarded in the use of traditional topics. Its relevance in the context of the 19th century had aimed to be excused as a reaction of the middle class, after the romantic revolution (or even during that time), predicting the possible loss of the traditions and folklore ‚Äúsmashed by the Industrial Revolution\\". Nevertheless, it was the progress achieved by this revolution the one which would catapult the costumbrismo, as one of his most known representative authors clearly states:Larra establishes the origin of the modern literature of customs in England, since Addison‚Äôs The Spectator. * Another view of the costumbrismo was the new possibility of travelling, a romantic passion that created the literary descriptive model of the libros de viajes (literally, books of traveling), usually more focused on the pictures and hackneyed things, the simple impressions or emotions, rather than the critical analysis or the ethnographic study = Custom pictures = The custom pictures -also called the articles of customs- are short sketches in which customs are painted, also the uses, habits, typical or representative types of the society, landscapes, amusements and even animals, sometimes with the purpose of entertaining (pleasant pictures) and sometimes clearly intended to criticize the society and indicate reforms with a moral intention. With the precedent of Juan de Zabaleta's 17th century, in the 19th century the customs picture Transido de queja of Mariano Jose de Larras, the most calmed part of Ramon Mesonero Romanos and the Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n's lyric part. Then, some big collective compilations were written based on these pieces that described types and popular professions, like Los Espa√±oles por s√≠ mismos (The Spaniards on its own way) (1843‚Äì1844), a collection that contains ninety eight articles of fifty-one authors. Its success gave birth to similar collections: * El √°lbum del bello sexo o las mujeres pintadas por s√≠ mismas (The album of the lovely sex or the women painted by themselves) (1843) * Los cubanos pintados por s√≠ mismos (The Cuban painted by themselves) (1852) * Los mexicanos pintados por s√≠ mismos (The Mexicans painted by themselves) (1854) * Los valencianos pintados por s√≠ mismos (The Valencian painted by themselves) (1859) * Las espa√±olas pintadas por los espa√±oles (The Spanish women painted by the Spanish men) (1871‚Äì1872) * Las mujeres espa√±olas, portuguesas y americanas (The Spanish women, Portuguese women and American women) (1872, 1873, 1876) * Los espa√±oles de hoga√±o (This year‚Äôs Spaniards) (1872) * El √°lbum de Galicia. Tipos, costumbres y leyendas (The album of Galicia. Types, customs and legends) (1897). = The novel of Costumbrismo = Some studies accept as novels of Costumbrismo during the 19th century Spanish period: Sotileza (Subtlety), Pe√±as arriba (Cheer up people) of Jose Maria de Pereda, La gaviota (Seagull) of Fern√°n Caballero, Pepita Jim√©nez (Pepita Jim√©nez) of Juan Valera, La hermana San Sulpicio (Sister San Sulpicio) of Armando Palacio Vald√©s, and certain passages in Benito Perez Gald√≥s's work. Yet in the 20th century, we find examples like La casa de la Troya or Currito de la Cruz (The house of Troy) of Alejandro P√©rez Lug√≠n and the works of Pedro de R√©pide, among others. = The costumbrist comedy = The comedy of manners appeared in Spain in the 19th century in hand of Romantic authors like Manuel Eduardo de Gorostiza (Contigo, pan y cebolla) (With you, bread and onion) and Manuel Bret√≥n de los Herreros with important works such as A la vejez, viruelas (To an old age, smallpoxes) (1824), A Madrid me vuelvo ( Going back to Madrid) (1828), El pelo de la dehesa (Pasture's hair) (1837) or Mu√©rete ¬°y ver√°s! (Go Ahead and Die, You'll See!) (1840). The formula prospered and at the beginning of the 20th century it became popular in the work of the brothers Seraf√≠n and Joaqu√≠n √Ålvarez Quintero and in the sainetes of Carlos Arniches (Del Madrid Castizo) (From pure's Madrid). = Costumbrismo in English literature = In England Richard Steele (1672‚Äì1729), who published his costumbrist magazine The Tatler, and Joseph Addison (1672‚Äì1719), who with the first one founded The Spectator magazine, were costumbrist writers and both of them have been considered the inventors of what they themselves called Essay or Sketch of manners. = Costumbrismo in French literature = The abb√© √âtienne de Jouy (1764‚Äì1846), whose work that notably influenced in the Spanish costumbrist Mariano Jos√© de Larra appeared in the Gazette de France between 1811 and 1817, is a representative of the costumbrist genre in the French literature, after the translations of Pierre de Marivaux (1688‚Äì1763) and the essays of Louis S√©bastien Mercier (1740‚Äì1814). Paul-Louis Courier (1772‚Äì1825) is less known among the Spaniards but also as important as Jouy. = Costumbrismo in Spanish literature = One of the features of the Spanish art, especially in its literature, is its tendency towards Realism that begins to take shape even yet in the first written text of the Spanish narrative literature that is preserved, Cantar de Mio Cid (The Poem of the Cid), and that is extended through the popular element that impregnates the Libro de Buen Amor (The Book of Good Love), La Celestina (Tragicomedy of Calisto and Melibea), Lazarillo de Tormes (The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities) or Don Quijote (Don Quixote) itself. Costumbrismo, as one of the elements that constitute this complicated feature, begins to develop in Spain especially in the 17th century because of the popularizing guidelines that come since the Council of Trent and the Counter-Reformation and because of the cultural borderlines closing ordered by the king Phillip II of Spain. Thus, popular people and environments that are not presumptuous, and that enable people to identify themselves with a kind of a closer religiosity, are taken as models by painters like Caravaggio. We can see popular types in paintings of Diego Vel√°zquez and Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, and Costumbrism becomes one of the elements that make up satiric literary genres like the picaresque novel and comic literary genres like the entrem√©s. Generally, it is considered that Juan de Zabaleta, , Antonio Li√±√°n y Verdugo and Bautista Ramiro de Navarra are the first costumbrist baroque writers who specialized in this kind of topics. In the 18th century, the entrem√©s is transformed into a sainete with such important authors as Ram√≥n de la Cruz, who specialized in a kind of Madrile√±ismo (from Madrid), and Juan Ignacio Gonz√°lez del Castillo, who reproduces types and customs from Cadiz. In the 1700s some painters begin to pay attention to the popular customs and types through fads like Majismo (Kindness). Francisco Goya in his Cartones para tapices,Collection of paintings painted by Francisco de Goya for the Real F√°brica de Tapices de Santa B√°rbara (Royal Tapestry Factory) between 1775 and 1792. (Cardboards for tapestries) or in his prints about bullfighting, and the B√©quer family, with their popular Sevillanas (from Seville) scenes, arrive at create quite a school of painting consecrated to the Andalucian customs, and formed by Jos√© Dom√≠nguez B√©cquer (1805‚Äì1841), father of the famous poet Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer (1836‚Äì1870) and of the painter Valeriano B√©cquer (1833‚Äì1870), whose cousin, Joaqu√≠n Dom√≠nguez B√©cquer (1817‚Äì1879), was also a costumbrist painter. Furthermore, in the cultural environments Casticismo (literally purity), a tendency to fix a natural, popular and national pattern for the literary style based on the native tradition, was set against the Cosmopolitanism and the frenchification of the Enlightenment. In the 19th century, that element acquires independence through the subjective element that the Romanticism covers, what makes that the interest in the colectiv or volksgeist (national or popular character) identity be renewed through the Nationalism and the Regionalism, being expressed on purpose in genres like the article or the custom picture, and cultivated in the press and then gathered in individual or collective collections by authors like Sebasti√°n Mi√±ano y Bedoya, Mariano Jos√© de Larra, Ram√≥n de Mesonero Romanos and Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n, among many others, and the novel of manners, but also in the theater through the chico genre (literally, little genre), and it appears as a non depreciable element in the novels of the Realism (Fern√°n Caballero, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda, Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, Emilia Pardo Baz√°n and Juan Valera.) In the Naturalism Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez, who finds an interrelationship in the attractive and dazzling valencian paintings of Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, is distinguished for his novels of Valencian ambientation. Another literary genre, the libro de viajes (literally, books of travelling), cultivated by national authors and by foreign authors, is also a son of the curiosity that feels the epoch for everything related to the picturesque customs. Costumbrismo invades the 19th century zarzuela and a certain type of the teatro por horas heir of the entrem√©s. The born science of the folklore, which studies in a scientific way the popular traditions, deals in compiling, classifying and studying traditional lyric, short stories, coplas, music, games, superstitions and beliefs, sayings, handicraft, gastronomy, ceremonies, rites, folklore, parties, legends, songs, dances and vulgar romances, area in which stand out a few experts like Agust√≠n Dur√°n, Antonio Machado √Ålvarez, Francisco Rodr√≠guez Mar√≠n, Eusebio Vasco and many others. In the literature, this interest in the popular literature is spilled across the so-called Neopopularism of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 19th it was even written serious literature in dialects like Extremaduran language (Jos√© Mar√≠a Gabriel y Gal√°n, Luis chamizo), Asturian language or even the Murcian language. In the 20th century stand out Quintero brothers for their Andalusian costumbrist comedies and Carlos Arniches for his pieces from Madrid; the costumbrist element appears as fundamental in the expressionist painter and writer Jos√© Guti√©rez Solana, one of the few costumbrist writers who doesn‚Äôt extol the popular aspects and who shows himself brutally critic in, for example, La Espa√±a negra (The black Spain) (1920), against the obliging paintings by Julio Romero de Torres (however, expressionists in essence) or more balanced by Ignacio Zuloaga; nevertheless, since the Civil War, this Costumbrismo involutes as it is identified with the superficial and uncritical picturesqueness of the European travellers to Spain from the 19th century and with an Andalusian (from Andalusia) impoverishing reductionism that was good to the economic necessity of promote the Tourism, especially in the cinema, where this type of products became known as espa√±oladas. Nevertheless, some prewar and postwar authors headed by Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna (Elucidario de Madrid, El Rastro) (Explanation of Madrid, The Track) are saved because they follow the 19th century tradition of the Sketch of manners. This group revolves around the so- called Madrile√±ismo (from Madrid), like Eusebio Blasco (1844‚Äì1903), Pedro de R√©pide (1882‚Äì1947), Emiliano Ram√≠rez √Ångel (1883‚Äì1928), Luis Bello or, in the postwar, Federico Carlos Sainz de Robles. As for the Andalucismo (meaning in English Andalusian literary expression), the deep 19th century vein is renewed by writers like Jos√© Nogales (1860‚Äì1908), Salvador Rueda (1857‚Äì1933), Arturo Reyes (1864‚Äì1913) and others. The Costumbrismo of the called Generation of ‚Äò98 has more value and shaded dyes, and looks in its trips the real Spain opposite the official Spain: Miguel de Unamuno writes De mi pa√≠s (From my country) (1903), Pio Baroja his Vitrina pintoresca (Odd display cabinet (1935), receiving in his Basque (from the Basque Country in Spain) trilogies, customs of that region, as in his etchings and literature his brother Ricardo Baroja; Azor√≠n appears to the Castilian (from Castile in Spain) and Andalusian scenery (Los pueblos, Alma espa√±ola, Madrid. Gu√≠a sentimental...) (The villages, Spanish Souls, Madrid. Sentimental Guide). Hereinafter, only authors like Camilo Jos√© Cela, seems to have counted with the costumbrista element, who is the creator of a new type of Sketch of manners, the esbozo carpetovet√≥nico, near to the esperpento, and authors like Francisco Candel, Ram√≥n Ayerra or Francisco Umbral, the last one is the author of a type of anti-burgues Costumbrismo with a radiant style.  Literary Costumbrismo in Latin America  The costumbrist novel had an especial repercussion in some countries. Thus, in Mexico or in Colombia for example, where Costumbrismo is inserted also in the field of other novels, not specifically in the costumbrist ones, it is well known the weight that elements of this nature have in a sentimental novel like Mar√≠a, by Jorge Isaacs. On his behalf, the article of customs, very popular and with wide dissemination, recreates sketches of manners of pure localism in his types and language, emphasis on the approach of the picturesque, occasionally container of a satire and social criticism with intention of reform, and other times almost photographic reproductions of the reality (sometimes with very raw scenes and rough, even rude, vocabulary.)Orlando G√≥mez Gil, Historia cr√≠tica de la literatura hispanoamericana 344 The American costumbrist work was usually abounding in localisms, in its desire to reflect a reality in a way as faithful as possible.Emilio Carilla, \\"El romanticismo en la Am√©rica hisp√°nica\\" 323-25 Notes  References   Bibliography  * Costumbrismo, literary Costumbrismo ","title":"Literary costumbrismo"},{"id":"53659819","text":"Vernon Kirk Armitage (20 October 1842 - 8 May 1911) was an English first-class cricketer who played in one match for Cambridge University Cricket Club in 1864. Cricket websites indicate that he was born at Hope Hall, Eccles, then in Lancashire; a history of Salford, however, indicates that his father did not purchase Hope Hall until 11 years after Vernon's birth, and lived at Pendleton before 1853. Vernon Armitage died at Birkdale, also then Lancashire. Vernon Armitage was the sixth son of the Lancashire industrialist Sir Elkanah Armitage and the only child of his father's second marriage. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. There is no record that he played cricket at Harrow and his only first-class appearance came in the match between Cambridge University and the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1864, when he batted low in the order and scored six runs in his only innings. Armitage graduated from Cambridge with both Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) degrees in 1865; the BA converted automatically to a Master of Arts in 1868.

He was born at Brisley, Norfolk and died at Petersfield, Hampshire. The son of the rector of Brisley, Edward Ash was educated at Rugby School and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Having played cricket at Rugby, he appeared in matches for Cambridge University only in his final year at the university, when he was awarded his Blue by playing in the 1865 University Match against Oxford University. A right-handed middle-order batsman, Ash made scores of 18 and 8 in that game, which Cambridge lost. Earlier in the same 1865 cricket season, Ash's best first-class match had been his first one: he scored 47 (out of a total innings of 98) and 17 in the game against Cambridgeshire. He played no further first-class cricket after the University Match. Ash graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1866; this was automatically converted to a Master of Arts in 1869. Before graduation, he had joined the staff of Haileybury College as an assistant master in 1865, and he stayed there until he retired in 1902.

Shepard Marshall Lorenzo Shepard, Sr. (July 10, 1899 ‚Äì February 21, 1967) was an American Christian clergyman and politician. Affiliated with the Democratic Party, his political career was focused in the city of Philadelphia. Born to an African American family in North Carolina, he came to Philadelphia to serve as pastor of Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church, a black Baptist congregation. He worked as pastor there for forty years and gained a national reputation as a preacher, rising to prominence within the denomination. Shepard also became involved in Democratic politics in Philadelphia. He was elected to three terms in the Pennsylvania General Assembly and three terms on the Philadelphia City Council, where he served until his death in 1967. Early life and education Shepard was born July 10, 1899, in Oxford, North Carolina, the son of Robert Shepard and Pattie Gilliam Shepard. Robert Shepard was born a slave and later became a Baptist minister and the superintendent of the Colored Orphanage Asylum of North Carolina. Pattie Shepard was also involved in charitable work and served as the head of the Women's Baptist Home Convention of North Carolina. Marshall Shepard followed his parents in joining the First Baptist Church of Oxford. He attended Slater State Normal School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, then received his Doctor of Divinity in 1921 from Virginia Union University, a historically black university in Richmond, Virginia. After graduation, Shepard moved to New York City, where he received additional education at the City College of New York and the Union Theological Seminary. From 1922 to 1923, he served as secretary for religious work at the 135th Street branch of the YMCA in Harlem. In 1923, he married Willia Lucille Owens, with whom he had two sons. That same year, he was hired as assistant pastor at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, of which Adam Clayton Powell Sr. was the pastor. Philadelphia pastor In 1926, Shepard accepted the position of pastor at Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, where he would remain for the rest of his life. The church struggled financially, especially after the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, and several congregation members mortgaged their homes to keep the church afloat. Shepard's reputation as a minister grew, and he served as assistant secretary of the National Baptist Convention and associate editor of the National Baptist Voice. Shepard chaired the National Baptist Convention's Board of Foreign Missions for many years, and in 1947 he was a delegate to the World Baptist Alliance meeting in Copenhagen. Despite his growing renown, he remained dedicated to his Mount Olivet church. His Sunday morning sermons were especially celebrated, and his preaching style drew praise from many contemporaries, including Gardner C. Taylor, who called him \\"the best extemporaneous preacher the Black race has produced.\\" In 1960, he endorsed Senator John F. Kennedy for president and decried those Protestants who would oppose him based on their opposition to his Roman Catholic faith. Political career Shepard spoke at the 1936 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Philadelphia. Shepard's congregation encouraged him to become involved in secular politics, and he held several offices over his lifetime. Running as a member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1934 as one of three members from the 18th district, along with fellow Democrats Joseph Ominsky and John J. Finnerty. (House members at that time were chosen from multimember districts.) While in the legislature, he co-sponsored a bill that would have banned racial discrimination in state contracting. Shepard was chosen to offer a prayer at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Philadelphia that year. The sight of a black minister on the podium led Ellison D. Smith, a segregationist Senator representing South Carolina, to storm out of the convention. Shepard's response to the incident was to say \\"it was just a sign the good brother needs more prayer.\\" In 1936, Shepard, Ominsky, and Finnerty were all reelected to the legislature. The following year, he was appointed to a commission charged with drafting a new city charter for Philadelphia, but the resulting document was rejected by the voters at the polls that November. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951. At that time, Shepard and Mary McLeod Bethune were the only two black people in government service in the nation's capital. Shepard resigned from his federal post to run in the 1951 election in Philadelphia. The Democrats nominated him for the recorder of deeds post which, unlike the Washington position, was elected by the voters. He was victorious in the election, winning as a part of a Democratic wave that swept the Republican Party from power for the first time in 67 years. The job, a former county-level position, was eliminated and the department consolidated into city government in 1953. Shepard was named to the equivalent civil service position, Commissioner of Records, after the consolidation. In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large seat on the Philadelphia City Council. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April. Shepard was reelected in 1959 and again in 1963. In February 1967, he underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. Three weeks later, he died at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital at the age of 67. After a funeral at his church, he was buried in Oxford, North Carolina. His son, Marshall Jr., went on to lead the Mount Olivet Church until his death in 2002. In 2008, the Philadelphia Housing Authority opened a new housing development near the church, which they named after Shepard.

Early life Bill Edley was born March 16, 1948 in Canton, Illinois. He attended Spoon River College and received his bachelor's degree in investment finance from University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. While at the University of Illinois, he was the President of the Young Republicans and affiliated with the Republican Party until Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal shifted his political leanings. From 1974 to 1989 he was owner and president of Automotive Wholesale, an auto parts store in Macomb and Monmouth. In 1985 he became president of the Macomb Area Chamber of Commerce. The next year he managed the race of Democrat George Lipper in the 95th district against Republican incumbent Kent Slater. Lipper, who received no outside help, lost. Edley was a delegate pledged to Paul Simon at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Illinois House of Representatives Slater then vacated the seat to run for a judgeship. In response to the candidacy of former State Senator and Republican Ken McMillan, Edley chose to run as the Democratic candidate. In an upset, Edley won the historically Republican 95th district by 2,000 votes. At that time, the 95th included all or parts of Fulton, Hancock, Henderson, McDonough and Schuyler counties. Slater resigned to take his judgeship and was succeeded by Leroy A. Ufkes for the period between Slater's resignation and Edley's inauguration. During his tenure, he was a staunch critic of Jim Edgar. Edley, with fellow Democrat Thomas J. Homer, was an opponent of the decision to rebury the unearthed remains of Native Americans found at Dickson Mounds unburied. In 1994, he led a group of rural Democrats in support of a measure to end an increase in benefits for individuals on welfare who had more children after the effective date of the legislation. He lost reelection in 1994 to farmer Richard P. Myers. Post- legislative life After his terms in the Illinois House, he became a financial consultant for Merrill Lynch, and a portfolio manager for Smith Barney. Edley, by then a resident of Peoria, ran as a delegate for the presidential campaign of Bill Bradley. In 2004, Ted Brunsvold, the son of Joel Brunsvold, resigned from the Western Illinois University Board of Trustees. On December 16 2004, Edley was appointed to complete this vacated term until January 2005 and then to serve a full term from January 2005 until January 2011. In August 2005, Edley resigned from the board to take employment with the Illinois Department of Corrections. Rod Blagojevich appointed Robert Cook to the vacancy. In 2008, Edley explored a run for Congress from Illinois's 18th congressional district in the race to succeed Ray LaHood. When presumptive nominee Dick Versace dropped out of the race, he reiterated this interest. Ultimately, the Democratic county chairmen of the district chose Colleen Callahan who lost to Republican Aaron Schock. In the 2010 Democratic primary, now a resident of Springfield, he ran for central committeeman from Illinois's 18th congressional district against incumbent James Polk of Peoria. The position of central committeeman serves as one of a congressional district's two representatives to the Democratic Party of Illinois; the other is a central committeewoman. Edley lost. As of 2014, Edley was still a resident of Springfield. As of 2017, he writes as a guest columnist for various newspapers including The State Journal-Register and the Quad-City Times.

History  The multi-century history of Savoy included the period before the County of Savoy, then the County of Savoy, the Duchy of Savoy, the period from Savoy to Sicily and Sardinia before Italian unification, and thereafter. From the Middle Ages, the state comprised the Duchy of Savoy, the Principality of Piedmont, the Duchy of Aosta and the County of Nice. From 1708, it included the Duchy of Montferrat, then the Kingdom of Sicily from 1713 until 1720, the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1720, and the Duchy of Genoa from 1815. These territories formed a composite state under the House of Savoy until the promulgation of a single constitution, the Statuto Albertino, was established in 1848. By 1861, this unified state had acquired most of the other states on the Italian peninsula and formed the Kingdom of Italy, while its territories north and west of the Alps (including Savoy proper) became part of France. The Final Act of the Congress of Vienna of 1815 refers to them as the \\"States of His Majesty the King of Sardinia\\". Among contemporaries, \\"Kingdom of Sardinia\\" and \\"Sardinia\\" were used as common short forms, even though they were confounded with the island. \\"Piedmont\\", \\"Savoy-Piedmont\\" and \\"Piedmont-Sardinia\\" are also sometimes used to emphasise that the economic and political centre of the Savoyard state was the Piedmont since the late Middle Ages. The seat of the rulers was in Turin. Each state had its own institutions and laws.

Kathy Brodsky (born January 8, 1945) is an American author and poet. She has written eleven books, ten of which are children's books, and one that is a collection of 65 poems reflecting her observations and insights about life. She was the writer- in-residence at the Pierce School in Bennington, New Hampshire, and at the Harold Martin School in Hopkinton, New Hampshire. Brodsky is a presenter for the Children's Literacy Foundation and has spoken at writer's conferences around the United States, and she has made guest appearances at libraries and schools across New England. According to the WorldCat global catalog of library collections, Brodsky's works are held by 111 libraries worldwide. Some of Brodsky's books have been published in a Braille edition for readers who are blind or visually impaired. One of her titles has been translated into Spanish. Brodsky's books have won multiple awards, including two national honors from the Green Book Festival, Book of the Year from Creative Child Magazine, and a top 10 listing from the International Literacy Association and Children's Book Council's Children's Choice Reading List. Each year 12,500 school children from throughout the United States read newly published children's and young adult books and vote for their favorites. Brodsky was selected for this list in 2014. Her books have been featured and reviewed in Publishers Weekly, The Huffington Post, Orange County Register, Edmonton Sun, The Guardian, New Hampshire Union Leader, Concord Monitor, Cape Cod Times, Monadnock Ledger-Transcript, The Portsmouth Herald, The Amherst Citizen, Foster's Daily Democrat, and The Telegraph. Brodsky is a psychotherapist and Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in women's, couples', and family issues. She has been quoted for her expertise as a therapist in The Wall Street Journal, The Sunday Independent (South Africa), the New Hampshire Union Leader, and Parenting NH. Psychotherapy career Prior to attending graduate school at Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston, Brodsky worked at Massachusetts General Hospital at a walk-in clinic connected to the psychiatry department. Later, as part of her clinical social work training in grad school, she worked at a youth guidance center in Framingham, Massachusetts, followed by a year counseling veterans at the VA Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts. After earning her MSW in 1970, Brodsky worked for five years as a therapist for the Greater Manchester, NH, Mental Health Center, an outpatient and acute residential treatment facility, where she was responsible for intake and therapy for adolescents and adults. Starting in 1976, Brodsky was a therapist at Child and Family Services of New Hampshire, a non-profit agency, where she counseled individuals; she later began helping couples, often prior to divorce, deal with their next phase of life. Following her eight-year tenure at Child and Family Services, Brodsky was named the citywide school and family education liaison, helping families of children with special needs in Manchester ‚Äì the largest and most diverse public school district in the state, with 14,000 students. In 1987, she opened her private counseling and therapy practice, which she continues to this day. Writing career Brodsky began her writing career with a poetry book, Moments in our Lives: A Woman's Eye View, published in 2004. The book consists of a series of poems capturing her experiences as a woman and a therapist. According to The Laconia Daily Sun, these poems \\"reveal joys, strength and courage in dealing with stressful personal situations.\\" Florence Henderson wrote of the book, \\"Brodsky's poems are a delight. They are full of humor, compassion, and insight into women's joy, frustration, and sadness.\\" Brodsky also recorded Moment of our Lives for audio listening. Brodsky's writing focuses on simple, everyday events that bring to mind larger issues in the world. Her first volume of essays, Moments in our Lives, illustrates universal life events and experiences ‚Äì memories of childhood, the joys of pets, and walks in the woods. = Children's Stories = After Moments in our Lives, Brodsky turned to writing children's books. The stories are all told in rhyming verse, and the poems aim to entertain while integrating social messages about the important issues children deal with in their lives. The Laconia Daily Sun writes that Brodsky's work \\"features lovable characters and their lively adventures concluding with questions designed to engage readers and activities meant to enjoy individually or in a group.\\" While each of Brodsky's stories has its own protagonist, the characters from her other books make appearances in each other's stories, allowing for recurring supporting characters in all Brodsky's books. \\"And rhythm is important,\\" Brodsky told book reviewer Ella Johnson, in a 2011 interview. \\"Each of my books started as a poem. What I like about poetry is that it's very succinct. Each character in my books comes from either something someone has said to me or something I‚Äôve seen.\\" Kathy Brodsky with a young reader at Books and Cookies bookstore in Santa Monica, California, following her book signing in May 2017. Brodsky's stories reflect her lifelong interest in animals and nature. The characters in them include dogs, cats, pigs, horses, and a talking tree. All stories have discussion questions at the back of the book, so that teachers and parents can talk about the major themes of each book, turning each story into an opportunity for further discussion. The stories cover issues that include peer pressure, healthy eating, and self-confidence. According to WorldCat, psychological themes found in Brodsky's books include the subjects: self-actualization, self-esteem, self-realization, change, identity, and individual responsibility. ‚ÄúBecause I am a therapist, my books all have very positive messages,‚Äù Brodsky told the New Hampshire Union Leader in a 2017 interview. Her books focus on topics such as being true to who you are, accepting others who are different, the advantages of unusual friendships and adjusting to change, she told the newspaper. In a review in the Children's Book Review, Hannah Coloson writes that Brodsky's stories \\"gently promote conversations about the issues today facing children and families, like childhood obesity, bullying, and the amount of time children spend plugged in.\\" = Inspiration for Brodsky's writing = Brodsky attributes her 47 years as a clinical social worker as a partial inspiration for her writing. In an interview with author Rebecca Rule, Brodsky said the stories her clients have told her \\"often reveal great courage, inner strength and joy.\\" Brodsky said she has witnessed the human struggle to \\"overcome personal difficulties that started in childhood.\\" \\"My books for children have messages in them that come from my social work experience...differences, friendship, loyalty, and social action,\\" Brodsky told journalist Michael Cousineau in a 2008 interview in the New Hampshire Sunday News. \\"I feel very strongly that all of us can be productive and contribute, even if we may be different in some way.\\" ‚ÄúKids go through so many changes in their young lives, and my books help teach them how to grow stronger through those difficult times,‚Äù Brodsky told journalist Kimberly Houghton in a 2017 interview. Brodsky‚Äôs books also highlight the importance of safety and kindness ‚Äî two things that she believes are critical for children to learn at a young age.  My Bent Tree  A walk in her neighborhood inspired her first children's story, My Bent Tree. She was walking her dog and saw a crooked pine scarred by an old lightning strike. It reminded Brodsky of her own childhood encounter with polio, as well as her many clients' challenges with adversity, yet \\"reveal great courage, inner strength and joy‚Äù by overcoming those challenges. The poem became a reflection upon early life experiences marking us permanently, but also becoming aspects of our lives that help us to grow into who we become.Kathy Brodsky, left, being interviewed by New Hampshire Union Leader correspondent Kimberly Houghton, before Brodsky's reading at the Nashua, NH, Soup Kitchen and Shelter for the Children's Literacy Foundation in August 2017. In addition to telling the importance of embracing diversity and overcoming hardships, My Bent Tree also concerns issues of environmentalism. The book received an award at the Green Book Festival, which honors \\"books that contribute to greater understanding, respect for, and positive action on the changing worldwide environment.\\" It has additionally been showcased by the Children's Book Council. The Girl Scouts magazine The Studio featured My Bent Tree in its article discussing how inspiration can come from anywhere. The Girl Scouts magazine also awarded a Brownie Badge to My Bent Tree under the category \\"My Best Self\\" for promoting self-esteem awareness. My Bent Tree was recorded as a talking book by the Perkins School for the Blind for its students to listen to Brodsky's writing. The Perkins School also published this book in Braille. While writing My Bent Tree, Brodsky commissioned artist Cameron Bennett to provide full-color illustrations for the story. The two have since collaborated on all of her picture books. Bennett's illustrations are created with acrylic paint on canvas.  The Inside Story  Brodsky‚Äôs third book, The Inside Story, began as an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, \\"they'll be very happy.\\" This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review that it is a story \\"about what happens on those occasions (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told from the point of view of an envelope.\\" This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: \\"Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I think the main theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods.\\" For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.  Just Sniffing Around  Kathy Brodsky at a Barnes & Noble signing to celebrate the release of Just Sniffing Around, in December 2009. Her fourth book, Just Sniffing Around, was dedicated to her French mastiff Cali, who died in 2008. The book opens with a picture of Cali, as well as a poem entitled \\"We are so Lucky to Have Each Other.\\" The illustrations in the book are modeled from Cali. Just Sniffing Around tells the story of a curious dog and the challenges of raising him. The discussion questions in the book focus on the responsibility of pet ownership, as well as the roles dogs play within the lives of their human companions. Pamme Boutselis of Parenting NH magazine writes that the book emphasizes \\"the special qualities that Brodsky feels these incredible four-legged beings bring to our lives.\\"  Purrsnikkity  The popularity of Just Sniffing Around brought requests for a companion poem for cat lovers. In response, Brodsky wrote Purrsnikkity, and held a contest to find a cat to be the main character. For every three pictures they submitted of their cat, children were encouraged to donate $5 to a local rescue shelter. The winning cat was selected by illustrator Cameron Bennett to be the model for the illustrations in the book. The Midwest Book Review writes, \\"Told from the cat's point of view (is there any other?), Pursnikitty presents many recurring themes in tales of pet care and responsible pet ownership.\\" Reviewer Steve McEvoy writes, \\"this book captures the essence and spirit of a cat and the cat's relationship to the family and the environment it lives in.\\" Brodsky said in a 2010 interview about the book, \\"the book's messages deal with family interaction and tolerance,\\" noting \\"how important it is to look beyond first impressions.\\"  The Winner Is...  Brodsky followed up Just Sniffing Around and Purrsnikkity with a book that combined both with The Winner Is..., a story of a bored dog that reads about a contest for a cat to be the star of a book. Jealousy ensues, and the dog decides to pretend to be a cat in order to enter and win the contest. Reviewer Cindy Donnelly writes, \\"Any parent of a budding 'star' knows that kids can get excited about winning, and sometimes they get frustrated if they are not the best singer, dancer, speller etc. This book can help them cope with the possibility of not being first place and being happy with who they are and the talents they possess.\\" Brodsky promoted a contest to find a floppy eared dog, similar to her cocker spaniel Sophie, to be the protagonist of the book. Photos of 100 dogs from around the United States were submitted by dog owners for the contest. The winning dog, a one-year-old bloodhound named Gabriel, was selected as the model for the book. Gabriel and his owner, Jim Schoch, are from Contoocook, New Hampshire.Publisher‚Äôs Weekly praised the story's humor and the book's illustrations. The Winner Is‚Ä¶ won a \\"Preferred Choice Award\\" in the Character Building category from Creative Child Magazine's Creative Toy Awards.  Stover  Brodsky decided to make a pig the focus of his own book because she thought he would be a great role model. In an interview, she notes, \\"we have a huge problem with obesity in this country. I thought that Stover would be a great role model for kids. He's a pig who knows how to be fit and eat healthy foods.\\" Her sixth children's book, Stover, is based on a pig featured in The Winner Is.... The story focuses on Stover's healthy lifestyle, which consists of healthy eating and working out. The book won a \\"Preferred Choice Award\\" from Creative Child Magazine in the Health and Fitness Storybook category, and the Children's Book Council spotlighted the book in its \\"On the Move\\" showcase, which presented books about \\"setting and achieving personal and physical wellness goals\\" for children. The book has received several favorable reviews, both for its poetry, and for its focus on the role of exercise and the dangers of poor eating. Reviewer Christopher Lewis notes the discussion questions at the end of the book \\"should lead to a discussion about exercise and how exercise can become a part of your life.\\" However, a reviewer from the Edmonton Sun in Alberta, Canada, objected to one illustration in the book that referred to Stover's body self-image. Kathy Brodsky at Barnes & Noble in 2011, reading her book, A Horse Named Special.  A Horse Named Special  After Just Sniffing Around, Purrsnikitty, and The Winner Is..., Brodsky decided to write a book about horses. For the story, Brodsky held another contest to find a model horse for the book's illustrations, this time with money going towards equine rescue organizations. The book Brodsky wrote, A Horse Named Special, is a story about a race horse who becomes a therapeutic horse and changes the lives of others after an injury. Diane Walters notes in a review, \\"the relationship between rider and horse is an empowering one: bringing new skills in the mastery of horsemanship, which can be life changing when normal physical limitations or emotional issues are continually a challenge to manage on a daily basis.\\" A Horse Named Special has been showcased by the Children's Book Council. The story has been recommended by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in its featured booklist on therapy horses, and was cited as a real-life inspiration to children using service horses.  A CatFish Tale  Brodsky‚Äôs 2013 book, A CatFish Tale, tells of a cat asked to care for some delicious-looking fish. The story teaches the responsibility of taking care of a pet, as well as the importance of making good choices. In her review, Diane Walters writes, \\"although clever and fun, also shows how hard it is to have self-control sometimes‚Äîespecially from a cat's point of view when minding the fish.\\" A CatFish Tale has won several awards, including Creative Child Magazine's Picture Book of the Year. It has also been highlighted by the Children's Book Council's \\"Silver & Gold: Friends New & Old\\" booklist, as well as selected by children to be one of the top 10 books on the International Literacy Association and Children's Book Council's \\"Children's Choices Reading List Award,\\" which allows over 12,000 children to choose their favorite books of the year. The book and its discussion questions have been praised for helping children understand vital issues of responsibility and compassion. Richard Davidson, psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, writes that, \\"through rhyme, illustration and probing questions, Kathy Brodsky offers a delightful tale of friendship and kindness that will help nurture positive social skills in our children.\\" Bill McManus, a reviewer for The Huffington Post, wrote, \\"A CatFish Tale is a funny book about unusual friendships. The author is quite talented in her use of rhyme in telling her stories.\\" The book was named the Storytime Pup's \\"Pick of the Litter\\" in Story Monsters magazine March 2017 issue. In early 2017, A CatFish Tale was translated into a Spanish-language edition - El Cuento de Don Gato Pez. El Cuento de Don Gato Pez is the first of three of Brodsky's books that will be translated into Spanish. The next two will be printed with both English and Spanish translations on the same page.  High Wire Act  Brodsky's 2016 High Wire Act tells the story of the personification of a traffic light that is blown down by a strong gust of wind. Watching traffic stand still without it, the traffic light comes to realize its own importance. High Wire Act was named the 2016 Book of the Year by Creative Child Magazine in its life skills category. It was additionally showcased by the Children's Book Council. = Brodsky's advice to parents = Brodsky told book reviewer Ella Johnson, in a 2011 interview: > Encourage your kids to read, read, read! Then when they're older, they'll > have tons of images and stories in their heads. When they're asked to write > something, they can 'reach inside' and pull out something in their > imagination. That's what happened to me. Writing is whatever you make it, > and it's yours. It can be so much fun!

It is a nine-acre woodland containing mainly silver birch trees with some oak and a smattering of holly trees, rowan, hawthorn and gorse. The wood is owned by the Friends of Harmers Wood Trust as a not-for-profit business managed on behalf of the local community. Geology As with much of the geology of Cheshire, the forest floor sits on 225-million-year old Triassic sandstone. Layers of soft red sandstone can be found with the harder white sandstone that has been quarried in four places in the woodland, during the 19th century for use in local buildings. Sports Harmers Wood has developed a reputation amongst the rock-climbing fraternity, with over sixty climbs of varying difficulty in two of the quarries. History The wood was originally known as the Pine Wood, presumably when pine trees grew in the area. However, most trees were destroyed during World War Two from jettisoned incendiary bombs from German planes after bombing raids on the city of Liverpool. Quarrying was carried out between 1830 and 1870 using hand-held tools and steam cranes with the stone being used in local buildings including St Paul's Church in Helsby.

Hair volumizers are used by both men and women. Men turn to hair volumizers to make their hair look more dense. Volumizers come in many forms such as shampoos, conditioners, sprays, pomades and lotions. Hair volumizers contain humectants, which work by attracting moisture from the surrounding areas to the hair strand, thereby swelling the hair and making it look thicker. Various polymers present in the volumizer coat the hair strand, making it look thicker and shiny.Evelyn R. Scott Hair Care Like A Pro 2015 When shopping for a volumizer, look for ingredients like starch, which soaks up extra oil, protein that helps your hair's texture, humectants for dry hair and polymers, which help to thicken each strand of hair. Shampoo and conditioner forms of the volumizers are used just like ordinary shampoo or conditioners. The spray and lotion form of volumizers are used on damp hair near the roots of the hair. In order to use a hair volumizer, the person using the product must flip their head downward and gradually blow dry the hair, with the air being blown along the shaft of the hair until the hair is dry. Drying the hair in this position will increase volume and achieve the desired effect. While the hairstyling products listed above are the most commonly used, there are other types of products as well.

It is also the name of a historical timber mansion which stood at the same location. The original pavilion was used by the then Ottoman ≈üehzade (prince) Mehmed Vahdettin. The site of this monument, which was demolished in 2013 and replaced with an inaccurate concrete replica, is now an official residence assigned to the President of Turkey. It is also used as state guest house. The residence was designed by the French-Ottoman architect Alexander Vallaury (1850‚Äì1921) and built by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876‚Äì1909). The sultan allocated the building to his brother, Mehmed Vahdettin (1861‚Äì1926), who resided in the pavilion before he ascended the throne in 1918. As he was removed from throne in 1922, and was forced to leave the country, he gifted the property to one of his odalisque. The real estate was parceled and sold to third persons. It is situated on a hill in √áengelk√∂y, on the Asian part of Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus. The real estate covers an area of . There are additional buildings in the property including Old K√∂√ßeoƒülu Pavilion, Kadƒ±n Efendi Pavilion and Aƒüalar Apartment. In 1988, Prime minister Turgut √ñzal (in office: 1983‚Äì1989) instructed the development of the pavilion into a rest home for the prime ministry. The restoration works terminated with the death of √ñzal in 1993. The contractor abandoned the buildings as the appropriations stood away. In 2007, the property was handed over from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to the General Directorate for Foundations, which assigned it to the Prime Ministry. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan (in office: 2003‚Äì2014) ordered the restart of the renovation works. All the buildings were pulled down. During the 'reconstruction' no attention was given to the architectural details, materialization, orientation, location, or the existing surrounding landscape design. Three adjoining historical timber mansions were demolished as well, and similarly all of them were 'rebuilt' without giving any attention to the original designs. The buildings resemble the original monuments only superficially. For landscaping, an area of was nationalized by governmental decree in 2013. Hundreds of trees were felled surrounding the Pavilion, and a tall concrete wall now surrounds the complex. During Ramadan 2014 residents of 14 neighboring structures were evicted from their homes. The transformation works completed in August 2014. Vahdettin Pavilion is used by the prime minister and serves also as a state guest house. There are a greenhouse, a decorative pool with water lilies, a helipad and a parking garage in the residence area.

Yavneh was named after a now-defunct Jewish school in Cologne, Germany that closed during World War II, which itself was named for an ancient city and academy in Israel. Yavneh is Dallas's first Jewish high school, following the closing of Torah High School of Texas. Yavneh Academy opened in 1993 with grades 9 and 10 and phased in the other two grades in subsequent years. Initially classes were held at the Jewish Community Center in Dallas. Rabbi Moshe Englander was the first principal; he was previously the assistant principal of a Jewish high school near Detroit. When the school opened, the yearly tuition was $7,000.

Following Dr. Portnoy's retirement in 2019, the school merged with Akiba Academy of Dallas (preschool through grade 8) to become Akiba Yavneh Academy. Beginning in 2019, the new Head of School is Rabbi Yaakov Green. Athletics and Extracurricular Activities Yavneh student-athletes have won numerous national tournaments, and its boys and girls soccer, volleyball, and basketball teams have advanced regularly to Texas state playoffs.

In 2020, they won the Texas State TAPPS 3-A Championship. In 2013, Yavneh's student newspaper, The Bulldog Print, was named the #1 student newspaper in the nation during the National High School Journalism Conference in San Antonio, Texas. Its Engineering Team, under the auspices of CIJE, was also awarded top national honors in 2017 and 2018. The school's Math Team has won #1 North Texas individual and team titles since 2016.

Originally it served as garrison and heavy artillery but transferred to the Territorial Force (TF) in 1908 as field artillery, in which role it served through both World Wars. In World War I it fought on the Western Front with 51st (Highland) Division. In World War II it briefly saw service in France after Dunkirk and was with Eighth Army in North Africa and Italy. Its wartime duplicate regiment served with distinction in the Burma Campaign. Postwar the regiment continued in existence until amalgamation in 1967. Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì4.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. One such unit was the 1st Midlothian Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) formed on 16 September 1859 at Leith in Midlothian, near to the City of Edinburgh. In December the title was changed to Midlothian Coast AVC, but by March 1860 it had changed again to 1st Midlothian (Midlothian Coast) AVC. The Major in command was Sir James Gardiner Baird, 7th Baronet of Saughton Hall, a former Regular Army officer in the 10th Hussars, from which he had been obliged to retire because of an injury sustained in a steeplechase. He had since served with the part-time East Lothian Yeomanry.Baird baronets at Landed Families BlogspotArmy List, various dates. Within months there were four AVCs in the county:Beckett, Appendix VIII.Grierson, pp. 130‚Äì2.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 128‚Äì30. * 1st (Midlothian Coast Artillery) Midlothian AVC (four batteries) at Leith * 2nd (Leith Artillery) Midlothian AVC (two batteries) formed at Leith 28 February 1860 * 3rd (Portobello) Midlothian AVC formed at Portobello, Edinburgh, 17 December 1859 * 4th (Musselburgh) Midlothian AVC formed at Musselburgh 28 February 1860 These were soon consolidated into a single unit (the 2nd being absorbed in 1863) of eight batteries, with Baird commanding in the rank of Lieutenant- Colonel: The 1st Haddington AVC, formed at Dunbar, Haddingtonshire (or East Lothian) on 20 January 1860, which had been attached to the 1st Administrative Battalion, Haddington Rifle Volunteers, since 1864, was attached to the 1st Midlothian AVC from 1873. (A proposed 2nd Haddington AVC at North Berwick had never been formed.)Litchfield & Westlake, p. 89. From 1 April 1882 the unit formed part of the Scottish Division of the Royal Artillery (RA); on 1 July 1889 the Volunteer artillery were regrouped into three large divisions, the 1st Midlothian being assigned to the Southern Division.Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. It unit dropped the 'Midlothian Coast' subtitle in 1888, and moved its headquarters (HQ) to a new drill hall at 30 Grindlay Street in Edinburgh the following year. There were modern guns available at Portobello and Musselburgh for drill. Gun practice was carried out at the annual camp, and for carbine practice it used the Queen's Edinburgh Rifles' range at Hunter's Bog in Holyrood Park.Osborne, p.274Midlothian at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. 16-Pounder RML gun manned by Artillery Volunteers. The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed coast defences, but a number of the early units manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth- bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. In 1886 the 1st Midlothian obtained two 40-pounder rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns on travelling carriages pulled by Brewer's dray horses from Younger's and McEwan's breweries. Previously the War Office (WO) had refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for the Volunteers, but the concept was regularised in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as 'position artillery' to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. In 1889 the 1st Midlothian AVC was issued with two position batteries of 16-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns, which were manned by four of the garrison batteries (referred to as Companies from 1891).Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9. The 1st Haddington AVC was consolidated into the corps in 1897, when it became No 9 Company, with it HQ remaining at Dunbar. In 1899 the artillery Volunteers were transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), and the unit was redesignated 1st Midlothian RGA (V) (MRGAV) when the divisional organisation was abolished in 1902. In 1901 a further battery of 16-pounders was issued to the corps and manned by the two remaining garrison companies in Edinburgh. In 1903 the RGA (V) position batteries were modernised and became heavy batteries; the 1st MRGAV reorganised as follows: * No 1 Heavy Battery ‚Äì from Nos 1 and 2 Companies * No 2 Heavy Battery ‚Äì from Nos 3 and 4 Companies * No 3 Heavy Battery ‚Äì from Nos 5 and 6 Companies * No 4 Garrison Company at Musselburgh ‚Äì from Nos 7 and 8 Companies * No 5 Garrison Company at Dunbar ‚Äì from No 9 Company Lieutenant A.H.M. Jamieson of the 1st Midlothian RGA (V) served during the Second Boer War as machine gun commander with the 6th (Scottish) Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. In 1902 the unit's 1st Battery won the King's Prize for heavy artillery at the National Artillery Association meeting, and in 1905 the 2nd Bty won the prize, with the other two batteries coming second and third. Territorial Force 15-pounder gun issued to TF units. When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the MRGAV was transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) and provided the bulk of the I (or 1st) Lowland Brigade, RFA, with one battery coming from the 1st Edinburgh (City) RGA (V), giving the following organisation:London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, pp. 295‚Äì6. * Headquarters (HQ) at 30 Grindlay Street, Edinburgh * 1st City of Edinburgh Battery ‚Äì from 1st Edinburgh RGA * 2nd City of Edinburgh Battery * Midlothian Battery * 1st Lowland Ammunition Column The unit was the senior field artillery brigade in the TF's Lowland Division. The batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.Conrad, British Army, 1914.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì14.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5. World War I =Mobilisation= The order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday 4 August 1914 when the Lowland Division was at its annual training camp on the Ayrshire coast. It immediately began guarding vulnerable points around Glasgow and the Clyde estuary. Mobilisation was complete by 10 August and the units proceeded to their designated war stations. For the I Lowland Brigade this was at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh. On the outbreak of war, units of the Territorial Force were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service: the majority of men in every unit of the Lowland Division did so. On 15 August the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/I Lowland Brigade= 18-pounder field gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. During the winter of 1914‚Äì15 the division underwent war training and served in the Forth defences. It was warned for overseas service on 5 April and on 11 May 1915 it was officially numbered as the 52nd (Lowland) Division. However, the division was destined for the Dardanelles Campaign and it was decided that the difficulties of operating artillery on the Gallipoli Peninsula precluded taking all the divisional artillery. 1/1st Lowland Brigade was therefore left behind when the division embarked, and remained in the Forth defences.Thompson, pp. 7‚Äì8. The brigade finally went overseas in October 1915, when it landed at Le Havre to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. On arrival in France the batteries were rearmed with modern 18-pounder guns, and on 10 November the brigade joined the 51st (Highland) Division, with which it would serve for the rest of its career in World War I.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 101‚Äì7.51 (H) Division at Long, Long Trail.51 Divisional RA at Long, Long Trail. In May 1916 the TF brigades of the RFA received numbers, the 1/I Lowland becoming CCLVII (257) Brigade ‚Äì though this was changed to CCLX (260) Brigade within a few days ‚Äì and the batteries became A, B, C and D. D Battery was then exchanged for 2nd Renfrewshire Howitzer Bty from the 1/III Highland (CCLVIII) Howitzer Bde, which became D (H) Bty, equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers. The brigade ammunition columns were abolished at the same time, and absorbed within the divisional ammunition column. 18-pounder in action on the Somme Somme In July 51st (Highland) Division joined in the Somme Offensive. An attack on 14 July had failed to capture the dominating ground of High Wood, and 51st (H) Division was tasked with renewing the attack on High Wood a week later. A night attack was to be tried: the bombardment began at 19.00 on 22 July, under the direction of low-flying artillery observation aircraft. German sources reported that the shelling was of 'painful accuracy' and prevented the troops in High Wood from being relieved, despite the number of casualties.Miles, p. 136. At 01.30 the following morning the division attacked, but by 03.00 they were back on their start line having suffered heavy casualties. British gunners had difficulty supporting attacks on High Wood, because they had to fire over Bazentin Ridge. The low elevation of the guns meant that shells skimmed the British trenches, the margin for error was small and numerous complaints were made that British infantry casualties were caused by friendly fire. Worn guns, defective ammunition and inaccurate information about the location of British infantry positions were blamed for short-shooting.Miles, p. 195. The setback seemed to confirm the division's nickname of 'Harper's Duds' (from their commander, Major-General George Harper, and their 'HD' formation badge). The division was withdrawn from the front on 7 August for rest and reorganisation. On 23 August CCLX Bde was reorganised again, with C (Midlothian) Bty being split up between A and B to bring them up to six guns each. 51st (Highland) Division's objectives at Beaumont-Hamel on 13 November 1916. The division returned to the front in October for the Battle of the Ancre Heights, the final series of actions of the Somme Offensive. A mass of guns was assembled, with the artillery of no less than eight divisions and eight heavy artillery groups supporting 51st (H) Division's attack on Beaumont-Hamel, which had been an uncaptured objective on the first day of the offensive on 1 July. The operation was planned for 24 October, and the batteries began firing to cut the barbed wire on 20 October, but it was postponed several times because of bad weather. Eventually 13 November was chosen. H hour was 05.45, when the 18-pounders started a Creeping barrage (a recent innovation) moving in front of the infantry at every five minutes. A quarter of the 18-pounders deliberately fired short of the barrage line ‚Äì this would have suppressed German outposts sheltering in shell craters in No man's land. The attack was helped by a dense fog, which screened the infantry from retaliatory shellfire as they struggled through the mud towards their objectives. The barrage halted for an hour on the first objective before moving on. Some of the infantry were held up by machine guns in the notorious 'Y Ravine', which had caused so much trouble on 1 July, but reserves were employed and both attacking brigades had reached the third German trench line (the Purple Line) by 07.50. The Green Line was next taken, but the fourth wave of attackers lost the barrage on their way to the final (Yellow) objectives and had to pull back to the Green Line to consolidate a position in captured trenches. Beaumont Hamel had finally fallen, and 51st (Highland) Division had gone some way to shaking off the 'Harper's Duds' slur.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 154‚Äì6.Cave, pp. 75‚Äì98. Disbandment On 18 November 1916 CCLX Bde was joined by the newly-formed 535 (H) Bty from the UK, which became C (H) Bty. However, on 28 January 1917 CCLX Bde was broken up and its batteries distributed as follows: * A (1st City of Edinburgh + half Midlothian) Bty ‚Äì became C Bty, CCCXV (2/I Northumbrian) Army Field Artillery Brigade * B (2nd City of Edinburgh + half Midlothian) Bty ‚Äì became C Bty, LXXXVI Army Field Artillery Brigade * C (535) (H) Bty ‚Äì R Section made D (H) Bty, CCLV (I Highland) Bde, up to six howitzers; L Section made up D (H) CCLVI (II Highland) Bde * D (2nd Renfrewshire) (H) Bty ‚Äì became D (H) Bty, LXXXIV Army Field Artillery Brigade Army Field Artillery (AFA) brigades were used to support different formations as required. LXXXIV and CCCXV AFA Bdes continued to support 51st (H) Division during the Arras Offensive in early 1917, but thereafter they were regularly moved around. By the Armistice in November 1918, LXXXIV and LXXXVI were with Fourth Army and CCCXV was with Third Army.Farndale, Western Front, p. 169; Annex M. =2/1 Lowland Brigade= Recruiting for the 2nd Line unit was good, and 2/I Lowland completed at Grindlay Street by the end of 1914.Thompson, p. 6.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5.65 (2nd L) Division at Long, Long Trail. 2nd Lowland Division formed in January 1915 (numbered as 65th (2nd Lowland) Division in August) but the lack of equipment and need to supply drafts to 1st Line units delayed training. 2/I Lowland Brigade remained around the Edinburgh area throughout 1915. In March 1916 the division moved south to Essex and joined Southern Army (Home Forces). By May, the artillery brigades had received 18-pounders and that month they were numbered: 2/I Lowland became CCCXXV (325) Brigade and the batteries became A.B and C. Later, CCCXXVIII (2/IV Lowland) (H) Bde was broken up, with one battery joining CCCXXV as D (H) Bty. Ireland In January 1917 the division moved to Ireland to relieve 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been the first TF formation to serve in that country. Before the end of the year a decision was made to break up the 65th Division. The infantry units were transferred or disbanded, but a number of divisional units remained in Ireland after the division ceased to exist in March 1918. These included CCCXXV Bde, which stayed at Fermoy until it was disbanded on 29 December 1919.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 7. Interwar years After the war, the unit was reformed and when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1921, it was designated the 78th (Lowland) Brigade RFA (TA) (becoming a Field Brigade, RA, in 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery). It had the following organisation:WO, Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at Grindlay Street * 309 (1st City of Edinburgh) Battery * 310 (2nd City of Edinburgh) Battery * 311 (Midlothian) Battery * 312 (5th City of Glasgow) Battery (Howitzers) at Elder Street, Glasgow ‚Äì from the old 4th Lowland (H) Brigade The unit returned to the reformed 52nd (Lowland) Division in Scottish Command. Royal Artillery brigades were redesignated regiments in 1938. World War II =Mobilisation= The Territorial Army was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, and existing units split to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 78th Field Regiment reorganised as follows:Scottish Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 78th (Lowland) Field Regiment, RA78 Fd Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.Field Rgts at British Artillery in WW2. * RHQ at Edinburgh * 309 (1st City of Edinburgh) Field Bty at Edinburgh * 310 (2nd City of Edinburgh) Field Bty at Edinburgh 129th Field Regiment, RA129 Fd Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * RHQ at Edinburgh * 311 (Midlothian) Field Bty at Edinburgh * 312 (5th City of Glasgow) Field Bty at Glasgow 78th Field Rgt remained part of 52nd (L) Division, while 129th joined its duplicate, the 15th (Scottish) Division, formed on 2 September 1939.Joslen, pp. 85‚Äì6.Joslen, pp. 58‚Äì9.Martin, pp. 1‚Äì3; Appendix C. =78th (Lowland) Field Regiment= After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been evacuated from Dunkirk, 52nd (L) Division was sent to Cherbourg to form part of a reformed '2nd BEF', arriving on 10 June. However, the situation of the French armies was hopeless and the division was evacuated again after only a week.Ellis, Chapter XXI.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 89‚Äì3; Annex H. As one of the few formations that still had its guns and equipment, the division became part of Home Forces' mobile reserve around London. Its field regiments had an almost complete establishment of modern Mk II 25-pounders.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 95‚Äì6; Annex D.. 52nd (L) Division returned to Scottish Command in November 1940. In May 1942 it began mountain warfare training for a potential operation in Norway, but 78th Fd Rgt left almost immediately. North Africa 25-pounder and Quad tractor moving up to the front in the Western Desert, 29 October 1942. The regiment, together with a signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals and a light aid detachment of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, came under direct WO Control in June 1942 preparatory to proceeding overseas. It left in August bound for Egypt as part of the reinforcements for Eighth Army.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 2 April 1942, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/515. It arrived in time to take part in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October. The regiment was officially attached to 1st Armoured Division, but actually three Troops (12 x 25-pounders were with 51st Highland Division, and the other three with 2nd New Zealand Division.Joslen, p. 567.Eighth Army Order of Battle, TNA file WO 201/693. After the pursuit across North Africa, the regiment was involved in the fighting in Tunisia. For the final advance on Tunis (Operation Vulcan) it formed part of a battle group of 4th Armoured Brigade (30 April to 21 May 1943).Joslen, p. 154. Italy Gunners of 78th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery queuing at a NAAFI refreshment van in Italy, 22 November 1943 (IWM NA8953) The regiment served in 5th Army Group Royal Artillery (5 AGRA) in the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).AGRAs at British Artillery in WW2. It then landed in Italy under Eighth Army's command in September 1943.Joslen, p. 467. In January 1944 it formed part of 2 AGRA supporting 56th (London) Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Garigliano on 17 January.Molony, Vol V, pp. 606‚Äì12. It was then switched to the Anzio beachhead, where it supported 1st Infantry Division, firing to disrupt German preparations for a counter-offensive that was finally launched on 7 February and defeated by 12 February.Molony, Vol V, pp. 731‚Äì6. =178th (Lowland) Medium Regiment= In April 1944 the regiment was re-equipped to serve in the medium artillery role. Because there was already a 78th Medium Regiment, the new regiment took the designation 178th (Lowland) Medium Regiment in May. Medium regiments consisted of two batteries, each equipped with eight 5.5-inch guns; 309 and 310 Btys continued with the regiment.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Medium Rgts at British Artillery in WW2. At various times in the latter part of the Italian Campaign the regiment was in 7 AGRA and 10 AGRA serving with Fifth US Army. For the Allies' final Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot) the regiment fired in support of US 10th Mountain Division in its crossing of the River Po, 15‚Äì23 April.Jackson, pp. 275‚Äì6, 288, 315. 178th (Lowland) Medium Regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. =129th (Lowland) Field Regiment= 25-pounder gun on exercise in Scotland, March 1941. Shortly after the outbreak of war, 15th (Scottish) Division moved to training areas in the Scottish Borders, the artillery going to Selkirk and Jedburgh. After three months it went into winter quarters that were chosen for tactical considerations, with 44th Lowland Brigade and 129th Fd Rgt disposed across the River Forth. It returned to the Borders for training in April 1940, with 129th Fd Rgt at Selkirk near 44th (L) Bde at Galashiels. However, the division had to make room for units returning from the Norwegian Campaign, so it moved south to Wiltshire and then after the German invasion of France and the Low Countries in May 1940 it moved into defensive positions in Essex, which it was holding when the BF was evacuated from Dunkirk. To cover over of coastline the division's three field regiments each had an average of only eight 18-pounders of World War I vintage.Martin, pp. 4‚Äì8. As the threat of invasion receded, the division was able to concentrate on mobile training in 1941. In September the field regiments finally got their full complement of 25-pounders. However, in November the division was placed on a lower establishment and became purely a mobile coastal defence formation in Northumberland, with 44th (L) Bde and 129th Fd Rgt around Wooler. It was used to supply drafts and complete units for service overseas. 129th (Lowland) Field Rgt (the regiment received its 'Lowland' subtitle in 1942.) left the division and came under WO Control in May 1942, and embarked in June for the Far East with 311, 312 and 493 Fd Btys.Martin, pp. 10‚Äì14. Burma 129th (Lowland) Field Rgt arrived at Bombay on 10 August 1942 and moved up to Ranchi, the base for operations in Burma, where it joined 70th Infantry Division with 24 x 25-pounders. On 21 November it moved to Chittagong, where it joined 14th Indian Infantry Division for the First Arakan Campaign.Farndale, Far East, Annex K.Joslen, p. 506. Since September the 14th Indian Division had been advancing into the Arakan through difficult terrain and appalling weather, road-building as it went. Its objective was Akyab, but only part of its strength could be supported at the front and 129th Fd Rgt was withdrawn on 10 January 1943 without coming into action. It moved to Imphal, on the India/Assam border, where it came under the command of 17th Indian Infantry Division, which had been refitting as a 'light' division designed for jungle fighting.Farndale, Far East, pp. 126‚Äì8.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 239, 242, 253‚Äì65. 17th Indian Division was covering the construction of the Imphal‚ÄìTiddim road. 129th Field Rgt moved up to the base at Shillong on 8 May, but guns could not be moved up the single Jeep track to the advanced posts at Fort White and Kennedy Peak in the Chin Hills, where skirmishing with the Japanese went on through the Monsoon.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 306, 390, 405. =129th Jungle Field Regiment= 3.7-inch Howitzer in action in Burma, 1944. The problem of operating artillery in jungle terrain was tackled by converting field regiments into 'Jungle Field Regiments' equipped with jeep-towed 3.7-inch mountain howitzers and 3-inch mortars. 129th (Lowland) was the first unit to convert and build up experience with this equipment. However, neither weapon had sufficient range or weight of shell, but the regimental fitters under Sergeant Farrell and Bombardier Clifford Jones worked out that they could fit a jeep axle and wheels to a 25-pounder, reducing the weight and width of the whole assembly. The regiment tried it out on the Tiddim Road and found that with very few modifications to the gun carriage and trail it remained stable even when firing the highest charges. The CO, Lt-Col Younger, reported the success in October 1943 and the regiment received a gun converted to this 'jury axle' format for trials the following month. By January 1944 the gun had proved its worth and jeep-towed Jury axle 25-pounders began to be issued to one field regiment in each light division. In really rough terrain the whole gun could be broken down into jeep-sized loads like a mountain gun.Farndale, Far East, pp. 141, 172‚Äì3; Annex L. Retreat from Tiddim The regiment moved to the Manipur Road with 17th Indian Light Division on 13 November 1943, but by 8 December it was with 5th Indian Infantry Division at Kohima and Imphal. From January it was back with 17th Indian Division, with which it remained for the rest of the war. 17th Division was still skirmishing from Kennedy Peak towards Fort White with a battery of 129th Jungle Fd Rgt supporting 48th Indian Infantry Brigade. 493 Field Battery was deployed with its jury axle guns at a height of , within of the crest of Kennedy Peak, claiming to be the highest guns in the world. The guns were constantly in action supporting infantry patrols, but enemy strength in the area began to increase in February as a prelude to the forthcoming Japanese offensive (Operation U-Go). 17th Division switched over to a defensive posture, with administrative units in the Imphal Plain grouped into self-contained defensive boxes.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, Appendix 19; Vol IV, Appendix 18; Vol V, Appendix 29.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 187‚Äì90.Farndale, Far East, pp. 174‚Äì6. U-Go was launched in March, with the aim of cutting off 17th Indian Division. The decision to withdraw the division from Tiddim came too late, and although it successfully disengaged from Kennedy Peak it was cut off by a series of roadblocks. On 15 March it was stopped at the Taitum Saddle. Lieutenant- Colonel Younger organised a fireplan with 393 Bty firing from the north and 311 and 312 from the south, which gave the Japanese no reverse slope for protection. The first attack on the block failed, but next day, reinforced by mountain and anti-tank guns, and one 25-pounder firing directly into enemy bunkers, the position was taken on 16 March and the following day the regiment provided Defensive Fire (DF) tasks to prevent it being recaptured. Suffering heavy casualties from the artillery fire, the Japanese suddenly fell back and opened the way to the bridge over the Manipur River. For the final stage of the retreat the division had to clear a block and recapture a supply dump at Milestone 109. A first attack on 22 March failed, but the following day with 311 and 312 Btys firing in support the enemy aa driven of the positions. The regiment's Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) were able to range their guns onto the objective when their own advancing infantry were only away from it. By now ammunition was down to five rounds per gun (the regiment had fired 6900 in three weeks), and attempts to air-drop supplies had failed, but on 4 April the regiment marched into Imphal where it met 5th Indian Division, which had been flown in.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 190‚Äì2, 195‚Äì8, 201, 235, 239‚Äì42.Farndale, Far East, pp. 176‚Äì9. Kohima‚ÄìImphal The whole of IV Corps was now dug in on the Imphal Plain with 17th Indian Division at Imphal in Corps reserve. While the emphasis was on IV Corps' efforts to relieve the besieged base at Kohima in the north, 17th Indian Division at Bishenpur on the Tiddim Road was still under pressure from the south. The divisional artillery was disposed in two 'boxes', most in the north, but with RHQ and three troops of 129th Fd Rgt in the southern box. The gunners themselves had to defend their boxes against attacks by Japanese infantry, as well as firing in support of troops fighting to clear the hills and to counter thrusts by Japanese columns. On 23 June the siege of Imphal was broken, and the position of the Japanese troops at Bishenpur became precarious as IV Corps went over to the offensive. By 31 July 17th Indian Division was withdrawn for rest. From the retreat from Tiddim to the end of July 129th Fd Rgt was in action for 244 days in which it fired 121,253 rounds.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 306‚Äì7, 329, 334, 347‚Äì9, 359, 361, 365, 371.Farndale, Far East, pp. 209, 213. On 4 September 1944 the regiment left Burma with 17th Indian Division and returned to Ranchi for extended rest and preparation for the 1945 offensive. For example, on 26 October 1944 311 Fd Bty carried out trials on firing 25-pounders from landing craft, which would be necessary for future river crossings and coastal landings. 17th Indian Division was now organised with two brigades motorised and one air-transportable. On 31 January 1945 it completed its retraining and the regiment returned to the front on 6 February.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 173, 180‚Äì1. Meiktila The division was to cross the Irrawaddy River and then act as a fast striking force towards Meiktila. It was ferried across the river on 18 February and drove towards Meiktila in a series of short actions.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 255, 266, 271. Farndale, Far East, p. 267. During this fighting a FOO of 129th Fd Rgt was killed; his Observation Post Assistant ('OP Ack') was Lance Bombardier G.C. Huntley, who made his own fire plan to neutralise the enemy, then organised a stretcher party to bring out a wounded officer and the body of his FOO. Huntly was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) but was killed a few weeks later.Farndale, Far East, p. 271. 17th Indian Division reached Meiktila by 1 March, but the Japanese cut the road behind the division, which then had to rely on air supply. Nevertheless, the guns came into action and the town was cleared by 4 March where the division prepared to meet the expected Japanese counter-offensive (the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay). There was bitter fighting around the perimeter during March as the Japanese tried to retake the airfield. The gunners used Airburst rounds to dislodge enemy snipers from treetops, and once again had to defend their own gun positions, but the airfield was held and the division's air-transportable brigade was successfully flown in. At the end of the month the road was opened, and reinforcements arrived on 1 April.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 286, 306‚Äì9, 313. Farndale, Far East, pp. 274, 277, 279‚Äì81. The regiment had fired 11,721 rounds in March. 17th Indian Division then hurried forward to catch up with the rest of the corps. It took over the lead on 28 April and after running fights along the road it had captured Pegu by 30 April. Although the offensive's objective, Rangoon, was only away, torrential Monsoon rain halted the advance. The abandoned city was occupied by amphibious forces (Operation Dracula). Having made contact with the Dracula force, 17th Indian Division was diverted to trap the retreating Japanese in the Sittang Bend.Farndale, Far East, p. 292.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 357‚Äì61, 389‚Äì98.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 19‚Äì22, 35, 47. The Battle of the Sittang Bend carried on through the Monsoon, with 129th Fd Rgt very active in the fighting as Japanese thrusts were stopped and pockets of resistance mopped up. The next phase of the offensive was due to be an amphibious assault on Malaya (Operation Zipper), but this was forestalled by the end of the war in mid- August. After a period with the Burma garrison,Farndale, Far East, pp. 305‚Äì6, 311.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 256‚Äì93. 129th (Lowland) Field Regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946 and disbanded in 1947. Postwar In 1947, the unit was reformed at Edinburgh as 278th (Lowland) Field Regiment in 51st/52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division with the following organisation:266‚Äì288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Watson, TA 1947.Litchfield, Appendix 5. * P (1st City of Edinburgh) Bty * Q (2nd City of Edinburgh) Bty * R (Midlothian) Bty In 1961, the regiment was amalgamated with the 357th (Lowland) Light Regiment RA (TA) to form the 278th (Lowland) Field Regiment RA (The City of Edinburgh Artillery) (TA). When the TA was reduced to the TAVR in 1967, the regiment merged with 277th (Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) Field Regiment and 279th (City of Glasgow and Ayr) Field Regiment and became Q (City of Edinburgh) Bty in The Lowland Regiment, RA, which was disbanded in 1975.Litchfield, pp. 278‚Äì9, 294, 304. Uniforms and insignia The original uniform of the corps was dark blue tunics and trousers, the latter with broad scarlet stripes. The tunic had a scarlet collar with silver grenades embroidered on both sides, blue cuffs, five rows of black cord lace on the breast, and black cord shoulder cords and Austrian knot. The head-dress was a busby, a round forage-cap with red band being worn in undress, and the belts were black. The 2nd Midlothian at first had scarlet cuffs and collar and white belts, but on amalgamation conformed to the dress of the 1st Corps. This uniform was worn down to the spring of 1881, when the corps changed to the regulation clothing. In the 1930s the CO of 78th (Lowland) Fd Bde introduced silver cap badges and buttons, and trouser turn-ups, for officers in walking- out and mess dress. This custom was revived in the 1950s when white metal beret badges were issued to all ranks at regimental expense. In 1958 the sword and full-dress pouch that had belonged to Sir Joseph Noel Paton, the first CO of 1st Edinburgh Bty in 1859, was presented to 278th (Lowland) Fd Rgt by his family, They were worn by the battery commander on every Royal saluting parade until 1967.

Its origins are older but the present building was constructed by the Delahayes at the very end of the 17th century when the house sat in Herefordshire. It has since been extended and reconstructed giving an \\"obscure and complicated\\" building history. The house is Grade II* listed. The parkland has traces of 17th-century terracing and a rare Grade II* listed dovecote. History The origins of the house are late-medieval, evidenced by the construction of the \\"extensive, vaulted cellars.\\" The house was purchased by the Delahayes in the late 17th century, who rebuilt the house in 1672. At that point, the house was located in Herefordshire. In the late 18th century, the house was owned by Jeremiah Rosher, whose family promoted the seaside resort of Rosherville, at Northfleet in Kent. The Roshers owned the house until the late 19th or early 20th century, undertaking significant restorations in the 1870s directed by Isobel Bernadette Rosher, an amateur architect. In the early 20th century, the house was again restored to its 18th-century appearance, with alterations in the Arts and Crafts style. Remaining in private ownership, the house was again restored in 1990-5. Architecture and description The house is of two storeys and seven bays, and is constructed of Old Red Sandstone with Welsh slate roof tiles. The house has undergone considerable modification during its history; many of the windows and doors are replacements, dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. The interior has also seen much restoration and many of the architectural fittings have either been moved from their original locations within the house or are later additions. Trewyn House is Grade II* listed, its designation describing it as \\"a manorial house which retains much of its historic character\\". The terrace and garden walls, steps, gate piers and gates, which give the house the \\"ceremonious\\" setting described by the architectural historian John Newman, are of Old Red Sandstone rubble and wrought iron. All have a Grade II* heritage designation. In the grounds is an early dovecote, dating from either the end of the 17th century or the start of the 18th century. The structure is octagonal, constructed of red brick, with a slate and wooden roof. It reportedly contained seven hundred and sixty-four nesting boxes. Described by Newman as \\"exceptionally fine\\", it is a Grade II* listed structure.

All of his known works are portraits; both full size and miniatures. Biography  Born in Paris, his father was a carpenter at the royal Palace of Versailles. One of his aunts on his mother's side was married to the Polish court painter, Louis de Silvestre.Gutowska, Krystyna, Louis Marteau i jego portrety uczestnik√≥w obiad√≥w czwartkowych, Rocznik Muzeum Narodowego, XIX, National Museum, Warsaw, 1975 It is not known exactly when he arrived in Poland, but it appears that his teacher, Maurice Quentin de La Tour made the recommendation to go and Silvestre arranged for his position there.Ryszkiewicz A., Francusko-polskie zwiƒÖzki artystyczne w krƒôgu J.L. Davida, Warszawa: Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe, 1967 In 1752, on the way, he spent some time at the court of Jan Klemens Branicki in Bia≈Çystok, where he painted portraits of the hetman's family. Once in Warsaw, King August III gave him the position of court painter. Initially, he lived at one of Branicki's manors then, from 1768 to 1780, he lived near the Royal Castle.Derwojed, Janusz, Bal, Irena. (eds.) S≈Çownik artyst√≥w polskich i obcych w Polsce dzia≈ÇajƒÖcych, Vol.5, Warszawa: Instytut Sztuki Polskiej Akademii Nauk, 1993 . Micha≈Ç Jerzy Mniszech From 1780-1783, he gave lessons to Anna Rajecka, a favorite of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who was meant to become a court painter, but spent most of her life in Paris. Later, her husband, Pierre-Marie Gault de Saint-Germain, would give Marteau a prominent place in his history of French painting. According to the art historian, Edward Rastawiecki, Marteau was a bit of a fop and always dressed in French style, even sporting short pants and white stockings in the middle of winter, and refusing to attend the fanciest affair if there was too much mud or snow on the streets. From 1765 to 1795, he is shown on Royal Records as \\"The King's Painter\\". He received a fixed salary as well as payments for each individual work. An art academy project that would have made him a professor at the annual rate of 300 ducats never materialized. He was given a monopoly on painting portraits of the guests that attended the King's famous Thursday Dinners. After the death of Stanis≈Çaw August, he came under the protection of Princess Izabela Lubomirska, the King's cousin and a favorite, whose father had forbidden her to marry the King when she was a girl. Andrzej M≈Çodziejowski In many instances, attribution is difficult to ascertain, as Marteau did not sign his paintings. Even so, his catalogued portraits constitute a who's-who of notable 18th century Poles, including Stanis≈Çaw Konarski, Adam Naruszewicz, Ignacy Krasicki, Joachim Chreptowicz, Celestyn Czaplic, Micha≈Ç Jerzy Mniszech, Ignacy Potocki, Andrzej Mokronowski, Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, Stanis≈Çaw Trembecki, Andrzej Hieronim Zamoyski, Grzegorz Piramowicz, Franciszek Bohomolec and (one of his best-known) Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj. In 1831, following the November Uprising, most of his portraits were transported to Saint Petersburg by order of Tsar Nicholas I. Three years later, they were burned in an effort to destroy significant records of Polish culture.

Bonar Law Bonar Law is briefly mentioned several times in Ken Follett's historical novel Fall of Giants (Book One of the Century Trilogy). Bonar Law plays a supporting, if off-screen, role in Upstairs, Downstairs. He is even said to have recommended family patriarch, Richard Bellamy, to be offered a peerage. His name was referenced by Julian and Sandy in Round the Horne, in a sketch called \\"Bona Law\\". Rebecca West's novel Sunflower features a portrait of Bonar Law as the statesman Hurrell.Literary London, books.google.co.uk; accessed 2 April 2017. Arnold Bennett's novel Lord Raingo features Bonar Law as the chancellor of the exchequer Hasper Clews. Lord Dunsany gently satirised the quiet way in which government decisions are made which affect many (but with little input from the many) in his short story The Pearly Beach. It begins \\"We couldn't remember, any of us at the Club, who it was that first invented the twopenny stamp on cheques. There were eight or nine of us there, and not one of us could put a name to him. Of course, a lot of us knew, but we'd all forgotten it. And that started us talking of the tricks memory plays...\\" The name they were groping for was that of Bonar Law.

In Harry Turtledove's novel, The Big Switch, Eden appears as a member of a group of disgruntled MPs who are gathered together by Ronald Cartland after Britain allies with Germany in mid-1940. In Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series of alternate history science-fiction novels, Eden first appears as the representative of the United Kingdom at the peace talks with the alien Race in Cairo. As it does not have nuclear weapons at that point in the story, the United Kingdom is not fully recognised by the Race, but is also too powerful for them to fully discount. Eden attempts to secure full recognition of the United Kingdom by the Race, but fails. Atvar, the Race's commander, notes that Eden is highly competent but attempting to negotiate from a position of weakness. In the succeeding series, Colonization, Eden is Prime Minister in 1962, leading a government which cultivates close relations with the German Reich. When Germany and the Race go to war, Eden refuses to lend British military assistance to the Reich, though formally supports German efforts against the Race. Music Eden is mentioned in a song by The Kinks, \\"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\\", from the album Arthur (1969). Plays Eden appears as a character in the play Never So Good (2008)‚Äîportrayed as a hysterical, pill-addicted wreck, spying on members of his own Cabinet by ordering government chauffeurs to report on their comings and goings. He is shown being overwhelmed by the chaos of the Suez Crisis and eventually forced out of office by his Conservative Party colleagues, at the urging of the American government. He also appeared in Peter Morgan's stage play The Audience (2013); in the premiere, he was played by Michael Elwyn). In the 2015 West End revival version, featuring Kristin Scott Thomas as the Queen, Eden is portrayed by Scottish actor David Robb. His scene in the play is a prediction of Eden's audience with the Queen the day before the invasion of Anglo-French forces in Egypt. The conversation that takes place features Eden attempting to feed selected information to the Queen rather than the whole facts about the Suez crisis and the Queen's reaction to the proposed invasion. In the play's 2015 rewrite, the Queen makes reference to Tony Blair, seen in a flashback, and his proposal to send troops to Iraq, likening it to the conversation she'd had with Eden 50 years previously about Suez. Television As Secretary of State for War in 1940, Eden authorised the setting-up of the Local Defence Volunteers (soon renamed the Home Guard). In the film of the TV sitcom Dad's Army, the (fictional) Walmington-on-Sea platoon is formed in response to Eden's radio broadcast. The debonair Sergeant Wilson takes enormous pride in being often said to resemble Eden. Eden is portrayed by Jeremy Northam in the Netflix television series The Crown. Eden is portrayed by Anthony Calf in the BBC television series Upstairs Downstairs (2010 edition). The first season of the UK TV series The Hour revolves around the Suez Crisis and the effect of journalism and censorship on the public's perception of Eden and his government, as a metaphor for modern Western military involvement in the Middle East. In the Ian Curteis television play Suez 1956 (1979), Michael Gough portrayed Eden.'Personal Choice', The Times (London, 24 November 1979), 11. Film Eden is portrayed by Samuel West in Darkest Hour (2017). Harold Macmillan *Beyond the Fringe (1960‚Äì66) **During his premiership in the early 1960s Macmillan was savagely satirised for his alleged decrepitude by the comedian Peter Cook in the stage revue Beyond the Fringe.Horne, Macmillan, vol.

The play was directed by Christopher Morahan. *Eden's Empire (2006) **Macmillan was played by Kevin Quarmby in Gemma Fairlie's production of James Graham's play Eden's Empire at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2006. *Never So Good (2008) **Never So Good is a four-act play by Howard Brenton, a portrait of Macmillan against a back-drop of fading Empire, two world wars, the Suez crisis, adultery and Tory politics at the Ritz. **Brenton paints the portrait of a brilliant, witty but complex man, tragically out of kilter with his times, an Old Etonian who eventually loses his way in a world of shifting values. **The play premiered at the National Theatre in March 2008, directed by Howard Davies with Jeremy Irons as Macmillan. *The Crown (2016) **Macmillan is portrayed by Anton Lesser in the Netflix series The Crown. *Pennyworth (2019) **Macmillan is portrayed by Richard Clothier in the Epix series Pennyworth.

During the pre-dawn hours of 1 April 2017, locally heavy rain triggered flash flooding and landslides in the city of Mocoa, Putumayo, Colombia, killing at least 336 people, injuring 400, and leaving 200 others missing. It is the third- deadliest weather-related disaster in Colombian history, and is regarded as the worst catastrophe in the history of Mocoa. \\\\-  Background  Situated in the Andes, the department of Putumayo is notorious for deadly landslides. The region's mountainous terrain and frequent rainfall makes it prone to such disasters. Much the same as the Himalayas, the Andean mountains in this region have ultra steep drops, from over 5,000 meters to 500 meters within 50‚Äì100 km, with that kind of drop, heavy rains tend to take boulders at high speeds along with them (locally called huaycos), not just water.https://phys.org/news/2017-04-south-america-deadly-landslides.html Throughout much of the first three months of 2017, the northwestern coast of South America saw above-average rainfall, leading to deadly floods in Peru and Ecuador. The rainy season in Colombia typically begins in mid-March and continues through mid-June. March 2017 proved unusually wet, with areas around Mocoa receiving 150 percent the average monthly rainfall.  Disaster  Debris left behind along a previously swollen river in Mocoa On 31 March 2017, moist tropical air from the Atlantic Ocean flowed west across the Amazon toward the Andes. A broad swath of ample precipitable water, or atmospheric moisture, extended across this region. During the evening hours, a slow-moving mesoscale convective complex developed within this region and produced heavy rainfall in southern Colombia. Infrared satellite imagery from GOES-13 depicted cloud tops of , indicating the storms were capable of producing torrential rain. With the system moving perpendicular to tall mountains, orographic influence likely enhanced rainfall and further contributed to the subsequent disaster. According to residents, the rain became particularly intense between 11:00 p.m. and 1 a.m. local time. A total of of rain fell during the event, largely within a few hours. This caused the Mocoa, Sangoyaco and Mulato rivers to overflow and send mudflows towards residences and infrastructure in the city of Mocoa by 3:00 a.m. \\\\- Neighborhoods built along the banks of the aforementioned rivers were completely devastated. Numerous poorly constructed homes were leveled, and large portions of the city were left buried in several feet of mud. The disaster adversely affected 17 of the city's neighborhoods, with the mayor of Mocoa, Jos√© Antonio Castro, stating some areas \\"[had] basically been erased\\". The Independencia neighborhood was entirely destroyed. Approximately 45,000 people were directly affected throughout the city. At least 329 people are known to have died in the disaster. An additional 332 were injured and a further 70 were missing. At least 22 of the injured were in a \\"delicate health situation\\" and transferred to Neiva. Another 21 victims were flown to Popay√°n.  Aftermath  Rescuers combed piles of debris for potential survivors President Juan Manuel Santos declared a state of emergency and stated that his \\"heart and the hearts of all Colombians are with the victims of this tragedy.\\" More than 1,100 soldiers and police officers deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts. Santos labeled the incident \\"a disaster caused by nature, by climate change.\\" A temporary morgue was established to handle the large number of deceased. The Colombian Red Cross activated its National Crisis Room in response to the disaster and deployed a team of 47 people to assist in recovery. Hospitals in the city were overwhelmed with the influx of patients, and much of the area was left without power and water. By 2 April, more than 2,500 personnel ‚Äî including 1,400 soldiers and 800 police officers ‚Äî were scouring debris for survivors. The army provided 63 vehicles, 10 helicopters, 7 boats, and 6 planes for the rescue operation. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res deployed an assessment team to the affected area on 2 April.

Life Verepaeus was born in Dommelen in the Duchy of Brabant (now North Brabant) around 1522. After studying the Liberal Arts and Theology at Leuven University he was ordained priest and became chaplain to the Augustinian canonesses of Mount Thabor Convent outside Mechelen. There he compiled the Enchiridion precationum piarum, one of the most reprinted prayer books of the Tridentine Church, which was translated into all the major languages of Western Europe except English.Stanley Morison, English Prayer Books: An Introduction to the Literature of Christian Public Worship (Cambridge University Press, 1949), p. 111.Herbert Thurston, \\"Prayer-Books.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

During the early stages of the Dutch Revolt Verepaeus sought refuge first in Cologne, where he stayed at the College of the Three Crowns in 1567, and later in Hilvarenbeek, where he taught at the town's college under the headmastership of Nicolas Busius. His introduction to Latin grammar and his handbooks on Latin composition were initially written for use in the school. In 1572 he returned to his duties at Mount Thabor Convent, but on 2 October 1572, during the Spanish Fury at Mechelen, the convent was burned down and his library destroyed. He nevertheless remained in the city, contributing to its reconstruction, until 1578, when the community he served temporarily disbanded. In 1580 he was living in Helmond, and from 1585 he lived in 's-Hertogenbosch, where he held a canonry in the cathedral and was headmaster of the city's college.

Produced for Adult Swim by the companies 6 Point Harness, Mosaic and Williams Street, its pilot episode was aired on December 4, 2016, while the series aired from July 9 to August 13, 2017. The series was not picked up for a second season.https://twitter.com/swimpedia/status/1133772624260149248 Plot Apollo Gauntlet is the pseudonym of Paul Cassidy, a police officer on Earth who gets sent to a futuristic medieval society by Dr. Benign. His namesake derives from the pair of sentient talking gauntlets he wears along with his magical suit. In this society, Apollo Gauntlet fights evil while trying to capture Dr. Benign.

The pilot aired in December 4, 2016, and was previously released on Adult Swim's official website in August 2016, along with the pilots for several prospective television series, including Brian Wysol's Hot Streets. Viewers could rate each pilot by clicking one of five buttons corresponding to their reactions. Daniel Kurland of the Den of Geek called the plainness of its animation style unique, identifying influences from the He-Man animated series and other animated fares from the 1960s and '70s. Kurland wrote that its setting would allow many stories to be told and that the \\"rogues' gallery of creatures\\" prevalent in the pilot were indicative of many more \\"exciting\\" creatures. The A.V. Club William Hughes called both Apollo and Hot Streets \\"very Adult Swim‚Äìesque\\", writing that they felt in tandem with Adult Swim's \\"core aesthetic of cheap-looking, surrealist animation mixed with self-aware dialogue, delivered with a distinctive slacker vibe\\".

In 1954 he was seriously burned while painting himself in a wedding dress but subsequently won the Slade diploma prize for the portrait he was working on at the time. In 1974, he won the John Moores Painting Prize for Figure with Yellow Foreground. Early life Myles Murphy was born on 14 February 1927 in Bury, Lancashire, into a Catholic family of eight children. His parents intended him to train as a doctor but instead he was influenced into art by L. S. Lowry who was teaching evening classes in Bury. He entered the Slade School of Art where he stayed for four years until 1955 and was taught by William Coldstream and Claude Rogers. He joined a group of students to whom Coldstream taught a precise method of depicting the human form using mathematical measuring that Murphy used for the rest of his life. In 1954, at his flat in Lower Marsh, in London's South Bank, Murphy planned to paint his then-girlfriend in a wedding dress. When she failed to arrive to model it, he decided to prepare a self-portrait in front of a mirror, wearing the dress himself. While doing so, the dress caught fire when it touched a paraffin heater and Murphy fell backwards on to a sofa that had been covered by his flatmate with petrol in order to kill bedbugs. In attempting to extinguish the flames, Murphy threw burning furniture out of the flat window onto the street market below. He was badly burned but recovered sufficiently to win the Slade diploma prize for the painting he was working on at the time. In 1955, he and Craigie Aitchison, a fellow student and close friend, won an Abbey Travelling Scholarship and drove to Ravenna in Italy in a dilapidated old London taxi that Aitchison bought for ¬£45.Myles Murphy.

It was opened in 1827. Urban expansion had meant that the old burial ground at the south end of Howe Street had become surrounded by houses and so could not be enlarged. While the old cemetery was still used for the descendants of Nova Scotia and Maroon settlers, this was subsequently turned into a playground. History of neglect The cemetery has a long history of neglect. Writing in 1958, Christopher Fyfe complained that the cemetery was little cared for, mentioning that John Bowen, the bishop of Sierra Leone in the late 1850s had described the place as ‚Äúa wild, neglected cemetery‚Äù. Lee Karen Stow made similar complaints after visiting the cemetery in 2015. Freetown City Council is responsible for the cemetery's upkeep. However the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment has been issuing documents which legitimise otherwise illegal occupation of parts of the cemetery. In this way the building of first temporary structures and then more permanent buildings has been encroaching on the land. The lack of any fencing has not helped the authorities to discourage this, or the dumping of waste there which is also prevalent. In October 2016 there were accounts of graves being opened and body parts removed. Although some fences had been erected, they were not sufficient to deter trespassing during the night after cemetery staff had gone home. Three people were arrested for this, two of whom were released for lack of evidence.

The election used the seven wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 23 councillors being elected, an increase of 1 from 2012. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. Following the Fifth Electoral Review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland, minor changes were made to several of the ward boundaries and one additional Councillor was added moving the total number of Councillors from twenty-two to twenty-three. The election saw the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party increased their representation on the council by five and significantly increase their vote share. The SNP retained their nine seats (though lost the council seat they had won in a 2015 by-election) and the Scottish Green Party retained their one seat. The Scottish Labour Party saw their representation on the Council drop by four seats and the Scottish Liberal Democrats and all independent candidates failed to win any seats. Following the 2012 election a coalition had been formed between the Labour Party and the Conservatives which replaced the previous SNP minority administration. In the aftermath of the 2017 election a new coalition was agreed between the SNP and Labour with Labour Councillor Christine Simpson becoming Provost of Stirling and the SNP's Graham Houston becoming depute convener of the council. 2017 Results Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes.

It consists of layers of sponge cake with a cream filling and is often covered with nuts or crumbs made from leftover cake. While the thin layers harden shortly after coming out of the oven, the moisture of the filling softens it again over time. There are many recipes and variations of this cake, but, the main ingredient is honey, giving it the characteristic taste and flavor.

Empress Elizabeth couldn‚Äôt stand honey, and any dish made with it drove her mad.

He later moved to Auckland and played for Manukau Rovers at club level and represented Auckland provincially. On his debut for Manukau he scored a try and kicked a goal in a 19 to 5 loss to a strong Ponsonby side. Scoring records were very patchy for the Manukau team with the newspapers often failing to send out reporters to matches in Onehunga and therefore it is unknown how many points Hardgrave scored for Manukau beyond the 2 tries, 1 conversion and 2 penalties he was credited with during the 1912 season. The Manukau senior team collapsed during the 1913 season and in the 1914 season Hardgrave joined the newly formed Otahuhu senior team. In 1912, Hardgrave was selected for the New Zealand national side who toured Australia. No test matches were played on the tour but Hardgrave became the 74th player to represent New Zealand.

(2017‚Äìpresent), and the video games. Introduced in The Lego Movie and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part =Emmet Brickowski= Emmet Joseph Brickowski (voiced by Chris Pratt in The Lego Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part and Lego Dimensions, A. J. Locascio in The Lego Movie: 4D ‚Äì A New Adventure, The Lego Movie 2 Videogame and some promos, Keith Ferguson in The Lego Movie Videogame) is the main protagonist of The Lego Movie. He is a construction worker chosen by the prophecy to find the Piece of Resistance to save the Lego World as \\"The Special\\" and stop the evil Lord Business. Wyldstyle, who helped him defeat Lord Business, becomes his girlfriend at the end of the original film. In the second film, Emmet must use his Master Builder skills to save his friends from a new danger. It turns out Emmet maintains his livelihood and is unaffected by the aftermath of the Duplo invasion unlike everyone else in Bricksburg (now called \\"Apocalypseburg\\"). Emmet also wants have a bright future with Lucy, but Lucy disagrees due to the fact that everything is rather bleak than awesome. After Lucy and his friends are abducted by General Sweet Mayhem of the Systar System galaxy, under the orders of shape-shifter Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi, he meets Rex Dangervest, a galaxy-defending (referencing Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy) archaeologist, cowboy (referencing Josh Faraday from The Magnificent Seven), and raptor trainer (referencing Owen Grady from Jurassic World), who is later revealed to be Emmet's future self as a time-traveler. After he destroys the cake wedding of Wa'Nabi and Batman, Emmet realizes the real intentions of Rex Dangervest and Rex knocks him under the same dryer to ensure his existence, but Lucy rallies the others into escaping from the storage bin (bringing them back into the LEGO world) and rescues him from Rex. They both overpower Rex and destroy his time machine and he is erased from existence. The LEGO universe is transformed into a mishmash of Apocalypseburg and the Systar System called \\"Syspocalypstar\\" which is peaceful. Emmet's dream house is rebuilt and Lucy reveals that she was one of the original artists of \\"Everything Is Awesome\\" much to Emmet's surprise. Emmet is the mascot of The Lego Movie franchise. =Wyldstyle / Lucy= Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks in The Lego Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, The Lego Movie: 4D ‚Äì A New Adventure and Lego Dimensions, Jessica DiCicco in The Lego Movie Videogame and some promos, Carla Tassara in The Lego Movie 2 Videogame) is a female Master Builder who met Emmet after saving him from the Super Secret Police's Melting Chamber. She was Batman's girlfriend and Emmet's love interest at the start of the movie. However, after Emmet saves the world, she leaves Batman and becomes Emmet's girlfriend with Batman's blessing. Her real name is Lucy, and Vitruvius implies that she kept changing her name due to being insecure about it. In the second film, Lucy inadvertently provokes the transition from Bricksburg to Apocalypseburg. In the five years that had passed, she has lost all hope things can still be awesome after Taco Tuesday. However, a cheery Emmet always buys her and himself two overpriced coffees every morning and meets up with her. Then, he shows her around a dream house he built. However, she wants Emmet to be tough like everyone else. Sweet Mayhem arrives and abducts her along with Batman, Benny, MetalBeard, and Unikitty. They are taken to the Systar System ruled by Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi. Lucy resists while the others are tempted into staying. She escapes and meets up with Emmet and rugged adventurer Rex Dangervest. They crash a wedding between Wa'Nabi and Batman. Mayhem reveals that Benny, MetalBeard, Batman and Unikitty were not brainwashed and the Systar System was not evil- and it becomes clear Rex is the bad guy. Rex manipulates Emmet into thinking Lucy is brainwashed while she tries to open her heart to him by exposing her true self and regretting for asking Emmet to change. He causes Ourmamageddon (they end up in a storage container while Emmet is abducted by Rex). Eventually, everyone escapes and Lucy saves Emmet from his fate on Undar in the Dryar System. Since Rex is a future Emmet who got stuck on Undar for years, and Lucy saves him, Rex ceases to exist. She reconstructs the dream house and reveals to Emmet she wasn't always dark and brooding. She was once a girly-girl with colorful hair and had exactly the same personality as Emmet. In addition, she was an artist behind Emmet's favorite song \\"Everything Is Awesome\\", much to Emmet's surprise. In Lego Dimensions, Lucy teams up with the \\"real\\" Lego Batman and Gandalf to save the universe by dimensions from Lord Vortech. She is also the mascot of The Lego Movie franchise. =Lord Business= Lord Business / President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell in The Lego Movie and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Keith Ferguson in The Lego Movie Videogame, Nolan North in Lego Dimensions) is the main antagonist of The Lego Movie. He is the president of the Octan Corporation and the Lego World. When President Business is not doing his job as a president, he is a despicable villain named Lord Business who wants to freeze the Lego World with Kragle, because he finds the Master Builders' creations combined with his too confusing. In his Lord Business form, President Business wears a fire-spurting helmet, a long cape, and extending leg attachments that light up in the middle. With some persuasion from Emmet, Lord Business caps the Kragle and makes amends by spreading the antidote for Kragle. Lord Business was also present when aliens from the planet Duplo show up to destroy everyone. Lord Business has a minor role in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. After the Duplo Invasion, Business flees Bricksburg to play golf and isn't seen again until the end of the film where his hair is accidentally set alight by Benny and he falls into a firework store. In The Lego Movie 2 Videogame, Business initially returns to his former reputation to take over Bricksburg, but changes his heart again when his robots program themselves to go against him. =Bruce Wayne / Batman= Bruce Wayne / Batman (voiced by Will Arnett in The Lego Movie, The Lego Batman Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Lego Dimensions, Unikitty! and promos, Jim Meskimen in The Lego Movie Videogame) is a DC Comics superhero from Gotham City, the secondary character and comic relief of The Lego Movie, and the main protagonist of The Lego Batman Movie. In The Lego Movie, he is a Master Builder and Wyldstyle's boyfriend, who helps Emmet save the Lego World. At the end of the movie, Batman gives Wyldstyle his blessing to be Emmet's girlfriend. In Lego Dimensions, there are two types of Batman: The Lego Movie Batman, as Lucy's ex-boyfriend, and another Lego Batman who is the \\"real\\" Batman. In the game's first cutscene, when the two Batman(s) meet each other, they have a brief argument about who is the real Batman before the real Batman takes Lucy with him to save the universe. In The Lego Batman Movie, as the main protagonist, he is depicted as an arrogant, selfish and sarcastic person like in the original movie, and teams up with his adopted son Richard \\"Dick\\" Grayson, his butler Alfred Pennyworth and the new Commissioner of Gotham City (and his crush) Barbara Gordon to stop his greatest enemy Joker. In The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, he develops a crush on Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi after being among those abducted by General Sweet Mayhem and decides to take her hand in marriage even though he has no interest of being a husband at first. =MetalBeard= MetalBeard (voiced by Nick Offerman in The Lego Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, The Lego Movie: 4D ‚Äì A New Adventure and Lego Dimensions, Roger L. Jackson in The Lego Movie Videogame) is a large, bionic makeshift robot pirate and a member of the Master Builders. MetalBeard originally had a normal pirate body, which he lost in a mission to the Octan Tower. He later rescued Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, Princess Unikitty and Benny after the destruction of Unikitty's kingdom, Cloud Cuckoo Land. In The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, it is shown MetalBeard can transform other forms, including a bike, to fight off the Duplo Invasion. After the Duplo Invasion, his body was destroyed and he has to use his treasure chest to move around. However, at the end of the film, his body was rebuilt from some instruments. In Lego Dimensions, MetalBeard was pulled into a vortex and captured by Lord Vortech as he had one of the twelve Foundation Elements (his Treasure Chest). His body (along with the bodies of Robin and Frodo Baggins) later becomes part of Vortech's minion, the Tri. =Princess Unikitty= Unikitty (voiced by Alison Brie in The Lego Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, The Lego Movie: 4D ‚Äì A New Adventure and Lego Dimensions, Jessica DiCicco in The Lego Movie Videogame, Tara Strong in Unikitty! and DFS Promo) is a unicorn-horned cat and Master Builder who is the ruler of the secret sky location called Cloud Cuckoo Land, where there are no rules or unhappy things. She is cute, positive, and optimistic, but also has a dark side when she gets angry. She was first seen welcoming Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius and Batman to Cloud Cuckoo Land and attends the meeting of the Master Builders. She was devastated when the Super Secret Police destroyed Cloud Cuckoo Land and is comforted by Emmet. There is also an animated spin- off series centered around the character, named Unikitty!, produced for Cartoon Network. In this show, Princess Unikitty is the ruler of the Unikingdom and has a little brother named Prince Puppycorn. She makes a silent cameo appearance in The Lego Ninjago Movie. In The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Unikitty is shown to be Emmet and Lucy's pet cat and is shown to grow to a full-sized version of herself called Unikatty. Unikitty was captured along with Lucy, Batman, Benny and MetalBeard. She was one of Batman's best men (despite the fact that she is female) at his and Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi's wedding. =Benny the Spaceman= Benny (voiced by Charlie Day in The Lego Movie, The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, The Lego Movie: 4D ‚Äì A New Adventure and Lego Dimensions, Mark Silverman in The Lego Movie Videogame) is a blue \\"1980's something spaceman\\" who loves to build blue classic spaceships. He's also a Master Builder and helps Emmet to save the Lego World. While attending a meeting with the Master Builders at Cloud Cuckoo Land, Benny was among those who join Emmet in the escape from the Super Secret Police. Both times in Cloud Cuckoo Land and on MetalBeard's ship, he tried to build a spaceship only to have his plans cancelled. During the escape from the Octan Tower upon Bad Cop approving the idea, Benny makes a spaceship which the others used to make their way back to Bricksburg. In The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Benny loses his right arm in the invasion of Bricksburg and is given a metallic one. He was captured with Lucy, Batman, Unikitty, and MetalBeard and taken to another planet where he met other spacemen.

One face is the bad one, which is mostly with Lord Business and when he questions people, while the other one is good, kind, and friendly. Besides being the son of Ma Cop and Pa Cop, Bad Cop/Good Cop is the leader of the Super Secret Police and works for Lord Business to find the Special. He also throws multiple chairs in the first movie. He first appears where he interrogates Emmet on the Master Builders and fed up with Emmet's refusal to admit anything, sends Emmet to the Melting Chamber. When Wyldstyle frees Emmet, Bad Cop and his forces pursue them to one of the secret tunnels. During a meeting with Lord Business, Bad Cop/Good Cop is introduced to a prototype of the Kraglized weapon that he is going to use on Taco Tuesday. He wants Bad Cop to test it on his parents. However, both his faces get into an argument and eventually he turns into Good Cop, with his conscience rendering him unable to \\"Kraglise\\" his parents. Realising Good Cop is taking over, Lord Business used nail polish remover and a q-tip to erase Good Cop's face enabling Bad Cop to do the job much to the horror of his parents. Bad Cop later helps the Master Builders escape and uses a marker to draw a scribble face to replace the Good Cop face he lost using a permanent marker. Upon the Kragle being disarmed, Bad Cop/Good Cop was reunited with his parents. In The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Bad Cop is a security guard for Apocalypseburg and has no dialogue. His name is changed to Scribble Cop since his face has been scribbled to replace the one he lost in the last film. =Vitruvius= Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman in The Lego Movie, Josh Robert Thompson in The Lego Movie Videogame) is a blind old wizard and a teacher of Wyldstyle.

He comes home from work and chastises his son for \\"ruining\\" the set by creating variations of different playsets while stating that he left the child blocks for him and his sister to use. With every Krazy Glue in his possession, \\"The Man Upstairs\\" proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together. Eventually, he finds that Finn based Lord Business off of him and joins Finn into removing the Krazy Glue from him. Upon being called up to Taco Tuesday by Finn's mom, \\"The Man Upstairs\\" tells Finn that he will now allow his younger sister to play with them. This resulted in aliens from the planet Duplo beaming down and announcing their plans to destroy them. He does not appear in the second film, only flashbacks from the first film. His voice is heard when Finn and Bianca's mother talks to them about putting the Legos into storage as he tells them to listen to what their mother said. The Man Upstairs is later heard at the end of the movie asking \\"Honey, where are my pants?\\" in a reference to the sitcom from the first movie. =Finn= Finn (portrayed by Jadon Sand in The Lego Movie and The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Graham Miller as a younger kid in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part) is a boy who is the son of \\"The Man Upstairs\\".

A recurring gag in the film is when she steps on Lego pieces with her foot causing her to scream \\"Ayeeee!\\" due to her being barefoot at the time. She even says that the pain is close to the pain she had during childbirth. The mother is the source of the \\"Armamageddon\\" (Our Mama Gets In) in which she is tired of Finn and Bianca fighting over their LEGOs and nearly has their figures all shut up in storage. This started \\"Armamageddon\\" which Rex Dangervest took advantage of. After Rex is defeated and Finn and Bianca reconcile, their mom watches them play with their father's Lego sets until she hears her husband asking her where his pants are. =Ma Cop and Pa Cop= Ma Cop and Pa Cop (voiced by Melissa Sturm and Liam Neeson) are police officers who are the parents of Bad Cop/Good Cop. Lord Business brought them in as a demonstration to Bad Cop on the Kragle weapon that he will be using on Taco Tuesday.

By the end of the movie, Ma Cop and Pa Cop are freed from the Kragle and reunited with their son. =Star Wars characters= The following characters from Star Wars appear in the film: Han Solo Han Solo (voiced by Keith Ferguson) appears from nowhere in the Millennium Falcon when Emmet and the Master Builders are arguing about where to get a hyperdrive from in order to invade Lord Business' tower. He complains to Chewbacca about their hyperdrive malfunctioning and they should not be in the \\"loser system\\" that the Lego characters are in. However, Lando Calrissian points out that Wyldstyle is a pretty girl, and it is clear Lando has fallen for her. Batman engages in a brief chat with Wyldstyle, and suddenly uses a grapple cable to jump onto the Falcon, attempting to socialise with the Star Wars cast members. This leaves Wyldstyle heartbroken and Emmet disappointed. Just as they discuss about Batman being \\"blind\\" and \\"a bad partner\\", the Dark Knight suddenly reappears behind Emmet with the hyperdrive. Benny then asks \\"...But won't they know their hyperdrive is missing?\\". The scene then shows a section from The Empire Strikes Back where the Star Wars characters are escaping from an asteroid with a Space Slug. Han tells Chewie to \\"hit the hyperdrive\\", but the spaceship fails. The Space Slug then emerges and swallows the Falcon. Lando Calrissian Lando Calrissian (voiced by Billy Dee Williams) is a friend of Han Solo. He was present with Han on the Millennium Falcon. C-3PO C-3PO (voiced by Anthony Daniels) is a droid.

After Armamageddon is thwarted and Rex's time machine is destroyed, Rex's future is rewritten as he fades away. He calls his fate \\"Back to the Future-ing\\" (although it also alludes to Star-Lord's death in Avengers: Infinity War and unlike in Avengers: Endgame, Rex is not revived) and shows redemption but states, \\"No regrets\\" except for not trademarking this same line. In The Lego Movie 2 Videogame, Rex is a playable character and has aviation powers with a jet-pack equipped to him.

Lower-limb amputees are unable to maintain the characteristic walking patterns of an able-bodied individual due to the removal of some portion of the impaired leg. Without the anatomical structure and neuromechanical control of the removed leg segment, amputees must use alternative compensatory strategies to walk efficiently. Prosthetic limbs provide support to the user and more advanced models attempt to mimic the function of the missing anatomy, including biomechanically controlled ankle and knee joints. However, amputees still display quantifiable differences in many measures of ambulation when compared to able-bodied individuals. Several common observations are whole-body movements, slower and wider steps, shorter strides, and increased sway. Presentation and causes  Lower-limb amputations  Human leg bones labeled An athlete with a single below-knee amputation using a running blade prosthetic Over 185,000 amputations occur annually, with approximately 86% of incidents being lower-limb amputations. The majority of cases are reportedly caused by vascular disease (54%) and trauma (45%). Lower-limb amputees are further categorized by where the amputation occurs with respect to the knee joint. However, 34.5% of individuals with an initial foot or ankle amputation experience a progression of symptoms leading to subsequent amputations at higher levels of limb loss. Out of these reamputation cases, diabetic patients had a higher likelihood of requiring further amputations, regardless of initial amputation location. The rate of amputation has decreased significantly with the introduction and optimization of revascularization to combat vascular disease. An increasingly studied trend in amputation rates is the gender disparity of women receiving more surgical revascularization treatments and less amputations than male counterparts. =Transtibial= An amputation between the knee and ankle joints transecting the tibia, or shinbone, is referred to as a transtibial amputation. In this situation, the patient may retain volitional control over the knee joint. The cause of amputation may dictate the length of the residual limb and the corresponding level of control of the prosthesis. The main impairment for transtibial amputees is the lack of adjustment of the foot and ankle. The foot acts as a lever arm directly attached to the calf muscle, but more than that, it absorbs the impulse from the ground and adapts dynamically to changes in the ground's surface. Transtibial amputees lose the muscle activation pathways necessary for the physical ability to generate work about the ankle joint, as well as the somatosensory and proprioceptive pathways of the lower leg. =Transfemoral= Unlike transtibial amputations, transfemoral amputations occur between the hip and the knee joints, along the length the femur. Therefore, the patient's residual limb is controlled solely by the hip joint. Implementing a prosthetic leg requires the user to mechanically control the behaviors of the prosthetic knee and ankle joints through gross adjustments of the hip, rather than the finer and more precise movements of the missing joints. Simple tasks such as walking on level ground, sit-to-stand transfers, and climbing stairs require complex alternative muscle activation patterns because the amputee cannot generate a moment about the prosthetic knee. This poses a problem when knee flexion is required, especially during the transition from the stance phase to the swing phase. Transfemoral amputees, on average, have more variability in stride length and walking speed, more asymmetry in temporal measures between limbs, and have an overall slower walking speed than transtibial amputees.  Compensatory Behaviors  A man with two prosthetic legs uses a hands-free harness walking gait training device during a therapy session Unimpaired human gait is characterized by its symmetry about the sagittal plane. In impaired individuals such as amputees, gait abnormalities are visible to the naked eye. Amputees often employ strategies known as protective gait behaviors to compensate for their impaired balance and control. These behaviors are most commonly categorized into increased general [body] and [torso] movement and increased variability of strides. The variability can manifest as a combination of differences in the length and width of the strides in comparison to the intact limb. =Bodily involvement= Before microprocessor-controlled prosthetic joints, the major findings were that the most noticeable movements could be seen in the shoulders, not the hips, and all subjects had uneven pelvic rotations, with more rotation on the prosthetic side. On average, the pelvic inclination is highest in transfemoral amputees in static non-walking studies. The integration of motion capture technology has been beneficial to more recent dynamic walking studies. Rotation of the pelvis is especially essential in transfemoral amputees for lifting the prosthesis and providing foot clearance. This behavior is colloquially known as 'hip-hiking'. As such, rotation and obliquity of the pelvis have been determined to be instrumental in producing more symmetric gait, even when the rotation itself is asymmetric between intact and impaired limbs. Torso or trunk motion is also linked to amputee gait, specifically increasing upper-body ranges of motion with decreasing walking velocity. Another study observed a coupling of torso and pelvis rotations. They noted that the 'hip-hiking' behavior made the rotations of the upper and lower body 'in' or 'out' of phase depending on the severity of the walking impairment, with the amputee subjects having a near-fully coupled bodily rotation. Torso involvement is not as readily apparent in able-bodied individuals. It is hypothesized that this gait deviation could lead to lower back pain. =Stride length= Stride length refers to the distance in the direction of forward motion that is between heel strikes of successive footfalls or steps. During the gait cycle, amputees have characteristically shorter time spent in the stance phase on the prosthetic limb compared to the intact limb. Stride length is arguably the most visible of the changes in amputee gait because it creates such an asymmetry between the intact and impaired limbs. However, the shorter stance time may help the amputee compensate for the greater margin of error of the prosthetic limb, and several sources suggest the shorter strides are beneficial towards maintaining a straight walking path. =Step width= Step width refers to the distance between the feet. A connection exists between step width and gait instability, though it is difficult to discern the difference between correlation and causation. Increased step width is commonly accepted as an indicator of gait instability because it is a coping mechanism to deal with external or environmental balance perturbations. A similar widening of step width and concordant slowing of gait speed has been observed between populations of elderly, obese, pregnant women, and amputees. Physically widening the distance between feet in a standing posture increases the structural stability of the body by widening the base of support or foundation. External lateral support mechanisms have been used to isolate the variable of balance in able-bodied subjects and succeeded in reducing both metabolic cost and step width. A similar experimental setup was used on transtibial and transfemoral amputees: transtibial amputees had reduced energy cost and step width, but transfemoral subjects had increased cost and a more marginal reduction in step width, possibly due to the harness interfering with necessary pelvic movements. Gait Deviations upright=2The compensatory behaviors listed above describe the observable differences in ambulation between amputees and able-bodied individuals. The following gait deviation measurements quantify differences using gait analysis and other tests that typically necessitate specialized instrumentation or clinical environments. =Metabolic cost= Energy expenditure is commonly used as a measure of gait quality and efficiency. Human metabolic rates are usually recorded via measuring the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) during controlled incremental exercise under observation. Treadmills are used for gait analysis and standard walking tests. Able-bodied and athletic individuals on average have smaller metabolic costs than impaired individuals performing identical tasks. The values from a theoretical model and experimental analyses are listed below: *Transtibial amputees experience 9-33% increase *Transfemoral amputees experience 66-100% increase Another source compiled a list of average metabolic cost increases categorized by amputation location and by cause of amputation: *Transtibial (traumatic) amputees experience 25% increase *Transtibial (vascular) amputees experience 40% increase *Transfemoral (traumatic) amputees experience 68% increase *Transfemoral (vascular) amputees experience 100% increase =Comfortable walking speed= Although heavily related to the metabolic cost and overall optimization of the gait, the self-selected walking speed of amputees is significantly lower than able-bodied individuals. Average values for comfortable walking speeds drastically vary between subjects because it is a personal measure. The speeds can be lower than 0.60 m/s or as high as 1.35 m/s. In comparison, self-selected elderly walking speeds are commonly below 1.25 m/s, and the reported comfortable walking speed of the able-bodied subjects is approximately 1.50 m/s. =Mechanical work= To compensate for the amputated segment of the limb, the residual joints are used for behaviors such as foot placement and general balance on the prosthetic limb. This increases the mechanical work generated by the residual joints on the amputated side. The intact limb is typically more adept at maintaining balance and is therefore relied upon more drastically, such as the behavior in a limping gait. Accordingly, the joint torques and general power of the intact side must increase as compared to an able-bodied individual. Even with the advanced computerized knee joint of Otto Bock's C-Leg transfemoral prosthesis, the subjects experienced increased braking and propulsive impulses than that of the standard double inverted pendulum model of normal human gait. =Other deviations= *Lateral sway *Step variability *Internal rotation Similar to decreased stride length and increased step width, lateral sway is generally postulated to be an indication of gait instability. The gait naturally widens to account for a greater instability or external perturbations to balance. Step variability is also related to balance and lateral stability. The variability in length and width of steps can be attributed to a level of responsiveness to external factors and perturbations, or an indication of inherent instability and lack of control. This has been a common discussion in analysis of elderly gait as well. Internal rotation is a culmination of measures of the hip and knee joints as well as the pelvic rotation and obliquity during gait. Typically, this has to be measured through motion capture and ground reaction force. Individual parameters can be calculated with inverse kinematics. Influential Factors upright=1.5 Across the field of research, many studies are focused on assessing how different factors can influence the overall gait of amputee subjects. The following list shows examples of factors that are believed to influence the gait characteristics of lower-limb amputees: *Weight of prosthesis *Distribution of weight *Alignment of components *Overall fit of prosthesis =Prosthetic weight and distribution= A common trend in modern technology is the push to create lightweight devices. A 1981 collection of studies on amputees showed a 30% increase in metabolic cost of walking for an able-bodied subject with 2-kg weights fixed to each foot. Correspondingly, transfemoral prostheses are on average only about one third of the weight of the limb they are replacing. However, the effect of added mass appears to be less significant for amputees. Small increases in mass (4-oz and 8-oz) of a prosthetic foot had no significant effect and, similarly, adding 0.68-kg and 1.34-kg masses to the center of the shank of transfemoral prostheses did not alter metabolic cost at any of the tested walking speeds (0.6, 1.0, and 1.5 m/s). In another study, muscular efforts were significantly increased with added mass, yet there was no significant impact on walking speeds and over half of the subjects preferred a prosthetic that was loaded to match 75% weight of the sound leg. In fact, it has been reported in several articles that test subjects actually prefer heavier prostheses, even when the load is completely superficial. =Alignment and fit= Initial alignment of a prosthetic leg is conducted by a prosthetist or physician to ensure proper use of the limb. The length of the residual limb is related to the amount of asymmetry in the walking pattern, with longer stumps on average having greater control. Misalignment of joints could result in postures similar to those seen in congenital malformations such as bow-leggedness, knock-knee, pigeon toe, and club foot. Misaligned sockets can simulate excessive hip and knee flexion and extension. As individuals get more experience on the limb, it is expected that they will optimize the alignment for their own preference. Transtibial In transtibial amputees, the adjustment of the foot is highly influential to gait changes. Proper alignment of the prosthetic foot about the ankle joint causes metabolic cost and gait symmetry at the anatomical hip and knee joints to improve, with hip flexion-extension motion being the most sensitive to alignment. Excessive rotational misalignment of the foot is compensated by internal rotation of the residual hip joint. Proper alignment of the transtibial prosthesis socket significantly reduced the loading on the intact limb during an 11-meter walk test, indicating that a misaligned limb could have drastic long-term consequences on the sound side of the body. Transfemoral Systematic changes to transfemoral prosthetic alignment altered the flexion-extension behavior of the hip, changing fore-aft ground reaction forces and the antero-posterior moments at the knee and ankle joints. The sole reliance on the hip joint to control the entire prosthetic limb makes fine-tuning foot placement difficult. Lowering the knee joint height was found to effectively increase the hip joint's lever arm, thereby increasing precision control of the hip joint to improve gait symmetry and increase running velocity by 26% on average.

Cases were first observed among black- capped chickadees in Alaska in the late 1990s, and it has spread rapidly since then. The cause of AKD is unknown, but may be Poecivirus, a prospective new species of virus within the family Picornaviridae.  Symptoms  In AKD, accelerated growth of the keratinized outer layer of the beak (the rhamphotheca) causes elongation and crossing of the mandibles of the beak. This is debilitating and often deadly, as it obstructs the birds' ability to feed and preen themselves, with the resulting dirty and matted plumage unable to play its role in thermoregulation. One potential secondary symptom is the formation of lesions on various other keratinized tissues. Areas affected include the skin, legs, feet, claws, and feathers. Since AKD is not yet well understood, it has not been determined whether these lesions are strictly a secondary symptom or part of a systemic disorder.  Prevalence  Initially, AKD was reported in only two species of Alaskan bird, the tree sparrow and a single specimen of the white-winged crossbill. While overgrown and crossed beaks have been identified in upwards of 30 species within Alaska alone, many of those have had only a handful of individuals affected. Other than black- capped chickadees, the species most affected are various corvids, nuthatches, and woodpeckers. In addition, surveys of Northwestern and American crow populations have indicated the possibility of regional clusters of AKD.

In 1969 an outbreak of communal violence in Northern Ireland broke out, and drawn to the conflict as a means of expression for his radical politics, Conway traveled to England in 1970 to join an Official IRA unit that was setting up paramilitary operations there to wage war against the British State's presence in the island of Ireland in the form of the Northern Ireland state. His first activities in London with the IRA consisted of taking part in a series of armed robberies of banks to raise finances for the organization. In the early 1970s he attended IRA training camps back in the Irish Republic, where he received instruction in firearms and bomb making, and became a full-time paramilitary, taking part in many gun attacks upon the British Army and bombings in Northern Ireland.Interview with Kieran Conway, 'HARDtalk' BBC, 20 October 2016. Published on Youtube 27 October 2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGu78sfInPA In November 1971 he was arrested in Derry by the Royal Ulster Constabulary for illegal firearms possession, and imprisoned in Long Kesh prison until September 1974, where he took part in protest hunger strikes. On being released from imprisonment in 1974, Conway was appointed by the newly formed \\"Provisional Irish Republican Army\\" (which he had joined after the faction had split from the \\"Official IRA\\") to organize from scratch a strategic level intelligence capability based in Dublin to assist in its operations. However his brief period in this role was hampered by the inherent parochialism of the PIRA, with its different units preferring to rely on their own information gathering resources in their individual localities for their gun and bombing attacks, and resenting what they regarded as outside interference from Conway's role in this regard.'Southside Provisional: From Freedom Fighter to the Four Courts', K. Conway (Pub. Orpen Press, 2014). On learning of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings in England, that killed 21 civilians, Conway was \\"horrified\\", and left the PIRA in 1975 in consequence. (Conway later stated that D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill told him that the \\"early indications\\" of why civilians were killed was due to phone boxes not working so the warning that was to be sent to evacuate the area was delayed). He rejoined the PIRA during the 1981 Irish hunger strike, and was active in the organisation in the 1980s before leaving it on 15 December 1993, with conflicting sentiments upon the acceptance by its leadership of the terms of the \\"Downing Street Declaration\\" (i.e. that the governmental status of Northern Ireland could only be altered by the democratic decision of its population). In part he regarded the ending of the campaign by the PIRA leadership as a \\"betrayal\\" of its political objective of the eradication of the state of Northern Ireland and the acquisition of its territory by an Irish Republican state, but at the same time he recognized that the PIRA was faced with imminent military defeat by the United Kingdom's security forces in the early 1990s, and that calling a formal cessation of its campaign and a disciplined disbandment of itself whilst it still retained the authority of command for the decision, was an act of realpolitik on its leadership's part.Interview with Kieran Conway, 'HARDtalk' BBC, 20 October 2016.

He has also stated that although not renouncing his actions in Irish Republican paramilitarism when viewed from their contemporary perspective, he wouldn't have engaged in it if he had known at the time that it would end in political failure, and that a \\"United Ireland\\" is unachievable as long as the Ulster Scots people oppose it.Interview with Kieran Conway, 'HARDtalk' BBC, 20 October 2016.

The large bronze sculpture is displayed on a high plinth in the piazza outside the British Library in London. The sculpture is based on William Blake's 1795 print of Newton: Personification of Man Limited by Reason, which depicts a naked Isaac Newton sitting on ledge beside a mossy rock face while measuring with a pair of compasses or dividers. The print was intended by Blake to criticise Newton's profane knowledge, usurping the sacred knowledge and power of the creator Urizen, with the scientist turning away from nature to focus on his books. Paolozzi had admired Blake since viewing a large print of Newton at the Tate Gallery in the 1940s. He was also a friend of Colin St John Wilson, the architect of the British Library, since they both participated in the This is Tomorrow exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956. Wilson intended to site a seated sculpture at the junction of the two main axes in the piazza of his library. Paolozzi was then working on a sculpture of Newton, and he was commissioned to create the sculpture for the library. The new library was constructed from 1982 to 1999, and the sculpture was installed in 1995. The sculpture includes Paolozzi's self-portrait as the naked Newton, measuring the universe with his dividers. The eyes were copied from Michelangelo's David. It can be interpreted as symbolising a confluence of the two cultures, the arts and the sciences, and illustrating how Newton changed our view of the world to one determined by mathematical laws. The sculpture makes the body resemble a mechanical object, joined with bolts at the shoulders, elbows, knees and ankles. The sculptures shows the visible seams of Paolozzi's technique of dividing his model and reassembling the pieces, for example on the head. The final full-size sculpture stands high, and is mounted on a high plinth. The bronze was cast by the Morris Singer foundry; it was funded by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. It was included in the Grade I listing of the library, granted in 2015. A maquette was donated by the artist to the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge. A bronze model cast in 1988 \\"from the model made to show the Library committee\\", has been held by the Tate Gallery since 1995.Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, Newton, 1988, Tate Gallery A similar sculpture from 1989, Master of the Universe, is at the Scottish National Gallery Of Modern Art in Edinburgh, with another example in Hong Kong.
