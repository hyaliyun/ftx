He is also Vice President Research of euRobotics, the European Association which has also functioned as the private side of the Public Private Partnership branded as SPARC, the biggest civil robotics program in the world which has been running until the end of the H2020 Program. He was also the funder and chair of the first robotics center in the Netherland started in 2008, first called Romech and then LEO Center of Service Robotics. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) since 2015 for contributions to modeling, control and realization of complex robotics systems and also a member of the Royal Holland Society of Science and Humanities (KHMW). He is recipient of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Distinguished Service Award and he is an ER] Advance Grant Laureate on the project PortWings. Early life After obtaining a Technical Degree in Computer Science in 1988 and then a Laurea (cum laude) from the University of Bologna in 1992, he moved to the Netherlands for a research position at the University of Twente until 1994. He then moved to the Delft University of Technology to receive a Ph.D. (cum laude) in 1998. The dissertation has also been published as a Springer monograph . During the Ph.D. he was also a visiting Scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA, USA, in the lab of Prof. Neville Hogan, the pioneer of Impedance Control in Robotics. Right after his Ph.D. he was appointed as Assistant Professor and short after Associate Professor at the Control Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology. In 2001 he moved back to the University of Twente as an Associate Professor and became full professor in 2006 at the age of 38. Short after he moved back to the University of Twente, he set up and coordinated a unique EU-FP5 research project called GEOPLEX, Geometric Network Modeling and Control of Complex PhysicalSystems, who gathered all key players in port-Hamiltonian system theory and control and delivered in the years of the project fundamental contribution in the field. The final deliverable was the book Modeling and Control of Complex Physical Systems which is still the main reference for the field of port Hamiltonian System Theory and Control. After a partial steering of the Control Group originally led by Prof. Job van Amerongen, in 2011 he took over complete leadership of the group which he grew to a Robotics Research Lab of more than 60 people focus on robotics and now called the Robotics And Mechatronics (RAM) Lab. Research Stefano Stramigioli has contributed and has been active in the fields of Control Engineering, Physical modelling, System Theory and Robotics. His research is characterised by the consistent use of energy-based techniques stemming from ideas of bond graphs and port-Hamiltonian system theory, originally introduces by Arjan van der Schaft and Bernhard Maschke who he brought and vastly used in the field of Robotics. Specific contributions can be found in the first use of Casimir functions for control, the Energy Router where also the idea of Energy Tanks was introduced for the first time, Sample Passivity and the Dual Architecture for tele-manipulation. He introduced the term of Energy-Aware Robotics, rather than using the term passivity, because the term passivity is usually wrongly associated to a los of performance in control, which is not the case. The main ideas related to Energy-Aware Robotics can be found in where also a fundamental theorem is introduced which shows the necessity of a concept called Control by Interconnection for any interactive Robotics systems. Another broader tutorial of topic related to this can be found in.

Bred and owned by Bertram Firestone and trained by Dermot Weld he was one of the best two-year-olds in Ireland in 1985 when he won his last three races including the Beresford Stakes. In the following spring he took his winning run to five by taking the Tetrarch Stakes and recording his biggest victory in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He ran unplaced in both The Derby and the Irish Derby and was retired from racing at the end of the year. He stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, Italy, Australia and Japan but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Flash of Steel was a \\"good-topped, strong-bodied\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by his American owner Bertram Firestone. He was trained throughout his racing career by Dermot Weld. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Kris an outstanding miler who won fourteen of his sixteen races. Kris went on to sire many other major winners including Unite, Shamshir, Balisada and Oh So Sharp. Flash of Steel's dam Spark of Fire showed little racing ability but was a half-sister to Musical Lark (Matron Stakes), Hartebeest (Prix de la Grotte, ancestor of Rosdhu Queen) and Spark of Life (Ladies Handicap). Racing career =1985: two-year-old season= Flash of Steel made no impact in his first two races, finishing unplaced in maiden races over six and seven furlongs respectively at the Curragh. He was dropped back to six furlongs for a maiden at Naas Racecourse in September, started odds-on favourite, and won by three quarters of a length from Wolf Call after taking the lead in the closing stages. He returned before the end of the month in a minor race over seven furlongs at Down Royal and won in more impressive style. On this occasion he was restrained by his jockey in the early stages, overcame some trouble obtaining a clear run and beat Halo's Sword by one and a half lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. The colt was moved up in class and distance for his final race of the year, the Group Two Beresford Stakes over one mile at the Curragh. The unbeaten British challenger Robbama started favourite ahead of the Vincent O'Brien-trained Obligato while the other five runners included Hungry Giant (runner-up to Woodman in the Futurity Stakes) and the Michael Stoute-trained Eve's Error. Ridden by Mick Kinane Flash of Steel looked outpaced i the early stages as Dancing Zeta set the pace but began to make progress on the outside in the straight. Despite hanging to the right he took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from Eve's Error. =1986: three-year-old season= Flash of Steel began his second season in the Tetrarch Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at the Curragh in April. Ridden by Kinane he won by three quarters of a length from Equator, to whom he was conceding nine pounds in weight. The 1986 edition of the Irish 2000 Guineas, run on heavy ground at the Curragh on 17 May drew an unusually small field of six, with three Irish-trained colts being matched against three British challengers. The British appeared to have a clear advantage as the Dick Hern-trained Sharrood started favourite ahead of Huntingdale and Green Desert whilst Flash of Steel was the 9/2 fourth choice in the betting alongside Fioravanti. The only other runner was Mr John who had finished fourth in the Tetrarch Stakes. Sharrood set a steady pace with Kinane positioning Flash of Steel towards the rear of the closely grouped field. In the last quarter mile most of the runners began to struggle in the testing conditions but Flash of Steel stayed on strongly, took the lead a furlong out and won by three quarters of a length from Mr John. As in the Beresford Stakes he hung to the right in the closing stages, slightly hampering the runner-up but there was no stewards' inquiry and the result stood. ON 4 June Flash of Steel was stepped up in distance and started a 25/1 outsider for the 1986 Epsom Derby over one and a half miles. He never looked likely to win but stayed on well in the straight to finish sixth, four lengths behind the winner Shahrastani. He faced Shahrastani again in the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 28 June but after reaching third place in the straight he faded to finish seventh of the eleven runners. Assessment In the official International Classification of European two-year-olds for 1985, Flash of Steel was rated on 73, ten pounds behind the top-rated Bakharoff. The independent Timeform organisation gave the colt a rating of 117 p, with the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual improvement. In 1986 he was rated 120 by Timeform, 20 pounds behind their Horse of the Year Dancing Brave. The International Classification concurred, rating him on 120, 21 pounds inferior to Dancing Brave. He was the top-rated Irish-trained horse in the 7 furlongs plus division and the second-best Irish-trained three-year-old colt. Stud record Flash of Steel began his career as a breeding stallion at the Irish National Stud in 1987 where he stood at an initial fee of IR£11,000. He later stood in Italy and Australia before being exported to Japan in 1991, where he covered his last mare in 2004. The best of his offspring was probably the filly Nagara Flash, a Grade III winner in Japan.

The excavations uncovered a series of Mesolithic platforms and stony layers, with Mesolithic activity dating from around 4500 cal. BC, with a range of dates into the Neolithic, with a final date of around 2500 cal. BC. As well as the Mesolithic stony platforms and layers, the excavations uncovered a series of pits, and prehistoric field walls related to the Céide Fields complex. The stone tool assemblage is dominated by vein quartz artefacts, with a smaller amount of flint and siltstone.

He lived in New Zealand from infancy and together with his brother, took over his father's company. The company flourished under their guidance and became one of New Zealand's largest builder of bridges for roads and rail. Early life Anderson was born at Edinburgh in 1850. His father was John Anderson, who was to become mayor of Christchurch and an influential businessman. His mother was Jane Anderson (née Gibson). The Andersons emigrated to Canterbury in New Zealand at the end of 1850 on , one of the First Four Ships, and settled in Christchurch. His parents, who had married in 1845, had previously lost two children during infancy and it is thought that this contributed to their decision to emigrate; John Anderson Jr. was their only child alive at that point. Another son, Andrew, was born in 1851. The Anderson boys received their education at Scots College in Christchurch. In 1866, they were both sent to Scotland for further education at the Merchiston Castle School in the Edinburgh suburb of Colinton. His brother then worked with a firm of civil engineers, while he himself worked at the Clutha Ironworks at Glasgow as a mechanical engineer. He furthered his education by attending classes of Professor William John Macquorn Rankine at the University of Glasgow. John Anderson returned to New Zealand in 1873; his brother followed him in 1876. Rugby union career =Amateur career= Anderson played for West of Scotland.The Essential History of Rugby Union: Scotland. Nick Oswald and John Griffiths. =International career= He was capped only once for Scotland. His debut came in the second international match on 5 February 1872 playing against England at The Oval, London. Professional career Upon his return to New Zealand, Anderson Jr. joined his father's company. 'J. Anderson, Engineer, Millwright, Boiler Maker &c;' manufactured steam boilers and the plant necessary to process agricultural products. A foundry was part of the business that was located in the heart of Christchurch, between Cashel and Lichfield Streets. The firm started to really prosper when both sons worked in the business. It took on large projects, first for the Canterbury Provincial government, and then other provincial councils and also central government. One example of a significant bridge was the Beaumont road bridge over the Clutha River, which is also known as the Dunkeld Bridge, as this was the original survey name for the township that soon took the name of Beaumont. The bridge was opened by John Anderson Jr. on 4 March 1887 with a champagne lunch. A champagne lunch of such proportions that the location for the presentation is still called Champagne Flat was held at the opening of the Waiau Ferry Bridge, these days a Category I heritage item registered with Heritage New Zealand. Another early and outstanding bridge was the Waiteti Viaduct, the northernmost viaduct on the North Island Main Trunk railway a few kilometres south of Te Kuiti. This structure was also completed in 1887. Probably the most significant structure on the North Island Main Trunk Railway is the Makatote Viaduct south of National Park. At , it is the highest on this line. It took three years to build and Andrew Anderson moved his family to the construction village, so that he could oversee the work. The viaduct was commissioned in 1908. The company diversified by importing engines, locomotives, they built steam engines, and started building oil storage tanks once the importation of oil began. Other interests Anderson family grave at Addington Cemetery Like his father, who was Christchurch's second mayor in 1869, Anderson Jr. was elected a member of the Christchurch City Council. In September 1892, he was declared elected unopposed in the North-West ward. At the time, councillors were elected for two-year terms. Anderson resigned in mid-April 1894 as he was about to leave for a trip to England. Anderson was succeeded in the North-West ward by Harry Beswick, who would a year later be elected mayor. Anderson returned from his trip in November 1894. John Anderson, Sr. was an inaugural director of the New Zealand Shipping Company and when he died in April 1897, the directorship was transferred to Anderson Jr. Death Anderson died on 26 May 1934 in Christchurch. He is buried at Addington Cemetery.

The election was marred by accusations of voter intimidation and a near total domination of Serbia's media by Vučić and his populist conservative Serbian Progressive Party. The protests started on 3 April and thousands of people had been gathering on the streets of Serbia's cities on a daily basis. They informed themselves via official Facebook protest pages. Protests The leading participants were university students, however on Saturday, 8 November, they were joined by the police syndicate, the army syndicate, taxi drivers, lawyers, postal office workers and other organizations who are protesting against the president-elect's authoritarian regime. Protests erupted on 3 April when Nemanja Milosavljević, member of the hip hop group Middle Finger Kru under the stage name German, posted an event called Protest Against Dictatorship 2017 saying \\"Sloba also won an election, remember that\\", referring to the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. On the first day, media reported up to 10.000 participants. Popular chants included \\"Vučić, you fag\\" and \\"Av av av\\" (Vučić's initials, also represents a barking sound). A group of protesters threw eggs at the National Assembly building and a makeshift wall displaying victims of the Kosovo War called the Serbian Wailing Wall was severely damaged causing public outrage. During the 8 April protest, according to president of the Army union, there were more than 80.000 people in Belgrade walking against dictatorship. A set of demands have been presented to endorse a democratization of the country, including measures to limit and oversee the President-elect's firm control. Portestors also demand independent monitoring and a new assessment of the recent presidential election, with responsibility to be shouldered by \\"those responsible for any irregular campaign, as well for [any] irregularities during voting and counting.\\" They also called for all \\"corrupt public officials\\" to quit, and for all media editors not respecting the press code to be held accountable. Protester holding Lord Acton's quote, referring to Aleksandar Vučić's absolute power On 11 April, protests were joined by NKPJ and left-wing union \\"Sloga\\". They protested against \\"bad situation of worker class\\" and against expulsion of their members from one Kruševac factory. The largest protest so far was on 12 April. The protesters have called for a break due to the Easter in the demonstrations; the deadline for their ultimatum to the government was 17 April. Since their demands were not fulfilled, the demonstrations are continued after the Easter holidays. The media reported that there is a possibility of protest radicalization by blocking the major city streets, bridges and universities. On 1 May, several thousand members of unions and left-wing parties, including New Communist Party of Yugoslavia, protested on International Workers' Day and supported the student protests. They protested against worker law and the International Monetary Fund, and for higher pay and better workers rights. In the meantime, the union \\"Sloga\\" also protested in Kruševac. On 31 May, the day of Vučić inauguration, there was opposition protest, as well the pro-government rally. There were large number of incidents on government rally, including attacks on journalists and anti- government protesters by SNS supporters and, so called, party parapolice members. On opposition protest were few thousand people from Belgrade, and on government rally was 10 000 people from entire Serbia. Organization Protests were held without formal organization and leadership. Anyone could participate in deciding and voting via a Facebook group concerning next steps of protests. Walking routes were posted on the Facebook page and discussed on the spot. Due to a decline in number of people walking and \\"loss of meaning\\", group of protesters in Belgrade made a separate faction called \\"With Culture Against Dictatorship\\" which will continue in protesting. Another fraction called \\"Seven Demands\\" has been formed. An informal group of students dissatisfied with protesters who expressed a will to cooperate with the opposition in achieving the protest goals broke out of main group. They stated their will to pursue action for \\"Seven Demands\\" but without implications for political parties and politicians. In early May, a faction \\"Against Dictatorship\\" announced via their official Facebook page that they would protest once a week instead of every day. Protests in Niš Protests broke out on 3 April.< A few thousand protesters spontaneously gathered at Trg Kralja Milana to support the Belgrade protest which had been held earlier that day. On 5 April, at National Theatre in Niš, plato protesters announced a set of demands, the same as those in Belgrade. On the same day, protesters had been throwing eggs at a billboard from Aleksandar Vučić's presidential election campaign. On 13 April, protesters set local demands including stronger budgetary control of institutions, introduction of participatory budgeting at the municipal level, criminal prosecution of corrupt judicial officials, fiscal transparency, and stopping nepotism.

He also wrote a gardens manual Lehrbuch der schönen Gartenkunst: mit besonderer Rücksicht auf die praktische Ausführung von Gärten und Parkanlagen (1873) which included a historical view on gardening styles from Arabia, China, England, Italy, France and Holland. Meyer trained at the Royal Gardening School in Potsdam under Peter Joseph Lenné and others. He worked on the planning of gardens, landscape photography and designed several gardens around Potsdam on orders from Frederick William IV. The style of gardening is called the Lenné Meyer school and used both geometric forms and free-form styles. He was appointed as court gardener in 1859. On July 1, 1870 he was appointed garden director of Berlin. His work included the design of Treptower Park and Humboldthain in which he used Humboldt's idea of using vegetation from different parts of the world. He died in 1877 and is buried at Saarmunderstraße, now Heinrich-Mann-Allee 25, in Potsdam. He was succeeded by Hermann Mächtig (1837-1909).

Hughes House Hughesdale is a neighborhood in the town of Johnston, Rhode Island. Hughesdale is a primarily residential neighborhood in the southeast corner of the town, centered near Central Avenue and Atwood Avenue. It is situated near the villages of Simmonsville and Thornton. The neighborhood is named for the local 19th-century mill owner Thomas Henry Hughes, an Englishman who arrived in America first to Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1839, and later to Johnston in 1849. Thomas Hughes established what would later be known as the Hughesdale Dye and Chemical Works on the Dry Brook, a tributary of the Pocasset River, in 1850. Hughesdale grew as a small mill village around the chemical works. Much of the village including the mill was destroyed by a flood in 1868, but the mill was quickly rebuilt larger than before. Hughes set up a post office at his store in 1876, and the Hughesdale Congregational Church was established the following year. By 1878, the village was occupied by some 300 inhabitants, and the mill employed over 50 men. Thomas Hughes died in 1883, and two of his four sons took over the business. The Hughes Chemical Works was destroyed a second time in a fire in 1914. Thomas Hughes's personal home from 1865 to around 1877, pictured on the right, is one of the few buildings still standing from this early era.

Several characteristics in particular make nanoparticles strong candidates as a traditional antibiotic drug alternative. Firstly, they have a high surface area to volume ratio, which increases contact area with target organisms. Secondly, they may be synthesized from polymers, lipids, and metals. Thirdly, a multitude of chemical structures, such as fullerenes and metal oxides, allow for a diverse set of chemical functionalities. The key to nanoparticle efficacy against antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria lies in their small size. On the nano scale, particles can behave as molecules when interacting with a cell which allows them to easily penetrate the cell membrane and interfere in vital molecular pathways if the chemistry is possible.  Metal Nanoparticles  A strong research focus has been placed on triggering production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) using nanoparticles injected into bacterial cells. The presence of excessive ROS can stress the cell structure leading to damaged DNA/RNA, decreased membrane activity, disrupted metabolic activity, and harmful side reactions generating chemicals such as peroxides. ROS production has been induced generally through the introduction of both metal oxide and positively charged metal nanoparticles in the cell, such as iron oxides and silver. The positive charge of the metal is attracted to the negative charge of the cell membrane which it then easily penetrates. Redox reactions take place in the cell between the metals and oxygen containing species in the cell to produce ROS. Other novel techniques include utilizing quantum dots such as cadmium telluride, under a bright light source to excite and release electrons; this process initializes ROS production similar to the metal nanoparticles.  Carbon Structures  Carbon nanostructures such as graphene oxide (GO) sheets, nano tubes, and fullerenes have proven antimicrobial properties when used synergistically with other methods. UV radiation directed at GO sheets, for example, disrupts bacterial cell activity and colony growth via ROS production. Doping nano tubes or fullerenes with silver or copper nanoparticles may also harm the cells ability to grow and replicate DNA. Nano tubes and fullerenes in particular are being studied as aqueous dispersions rather than polymers, metals or other traditional dry solid particulates. The exact mechanism which promotes this synergy is not clearly understood but it is believe to be linked to the unique surface chemistry of carbon nanostrctures (i.e. the large aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes, high surface energy in GO sheets). Human applications of carbon nano materials have not been tested due to the unknown potential hazards. Current research on the carcinogenic effects, if any, of carbon nanostructures is still in its infancy and there is therefore no clear consensus on the topic.  Drug Synergies  Nanoparticles can enhance the effects of traditional antibiotics which a bacteria may have become resistant to, and decrease the overall minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required for a drug. Silver nanoparticles improve the activity of amoxicillin, penicillin, and gentamicin in bacteria by altering membrane permeability and improving drug deliveryFlórez-Castillo, J.M., Ropero-Vega, J.L., Perullini, M., Jobbágy, M.

DOI: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01872 . nanoparticles themselves may have antimicrobial properties enhanced or induced with the addition of organic drugs. Gold particles, while not inherently antimicrobial, were discovered to express antimicrobial properties when functionalized with ampicillin. In addition to this, gold nanoparticles demonstrated improved membrane permeability with the addition of 4,6-diamino-2-pyrimidenthiol (DAPT) and non-antiobiotic amines (NAA) to their surfaces.

Therefore, often sharing the same family tree, heritage, Jat roots and ancestors. Many people who use \\"Maan\\", \\" Gill \\" and \\" Waraich \\" as their last names have Sasanian roots as well as Jat heritage. It is safe to say that many Muslim and Sikh people have these 3, Jatt Sikh and Jutt Muslim last names due to cultural and blood ties with the original Jat clans. Also noteworthy, that the Sasan people were originally hunters and were known for their superior hunting skills.

Six others who were with Pehlu Khan were also beaten by the cow vigilantes. Background The Supreme Court has issued notices to Rajasthan along with four other Indian states (Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Karnataka) and to the central government asking for a ban on such groups. During the attack, Rajasthan and the neighboring state of Haryana were ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, and cow vigilante groups were active in those states. Incident The victim was Pehlu Khan, a 55-year old resident Jaisinghpur village, in Nuh tehsil of Mewat. On 31 March, he left his village for Jaipur to purchase dairy cattle. Khan was one of only 10 dairy farmers in his village, and he was hoping to increase milk production for the upcoming holy month of Ramadan. On 1 April, Khan, along with six others, was returning from Jaipur to his village in Nuh, Haryana, carrying cows and calves. They were allegedly stopped near Jaguwas crossing at Jaipur-Delhi national highway by 200 cow vigilantes. Khan showed a Jaipur civic document as proof the cows had been bought for milk. According to Irshad, the son of Pehlu Khan who with him, \\"We had all the relevant papers to show that we were carrying the cows for dairy farming. We showed them the receipt of sale and purchase. But they were in no mood to listen to us. They tore our documents and attacked my father in front of my eyes.\\" Despite the documentation, Khan and others were dragged out of their vehicles. The mob beat them with rods and sticks. Pehlu Khan later died from his injuries, whilst others, though seriously injured, survived. The perpetrators also reportedly robbed the victims of their cellphones and wallets (the victims said they lost Rs. 110,000). Arrests Police have arrested three people; Kalu Ram aged 44 of Ratanpura, Vipin Yadav aged 19, and Ravindra Yadav aged 30 from Behror. Home Minister Rajnath Singh has assured justice for the lynching incident. Response The incident was widely condemned, and many called for the government to crack down on cow- protection vigilante groups. =Government= Rajasthan's Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria defended the cow vigilantes, describing their deed as \\"alright\\" and blaming the victims for illegally transporting animals though the victims had documents from Jaipur Municipal Corporation for the purchase of cows. Initially, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi also denied the incident and stated \\"Alwar gau rakshak attack did not happen\\", but later admitted the incident and tried to clarify his earlier remark. Federal Minister Hansraj Ahir condemned the incident. Congress vice President Rahul Gandhi condemned the killing. =Other= Sadhvi Kamal Didi praised the vigilantes accused of carrying out the lynching. Kamal Didi is the president of Rasthriya Mahila Gau Rakshak Dal, a cow-protection group. She equated the accused to popular historical Indian figures like Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad, saying the vigilantes of today will \\"be known as heroes in the future\\".

Succeeding on the death of his father Rostom Gurieli, Giorgi's rule over his small principality, located in southwest Georgia, was a period of conflict with the neighboring Dadiani of Mingrelia and increasing assertiveness of the Ottomans whom Gurieli submitted in 1581. His reign was interrupted, from 1583 to 1587, by a Mingrelian invasion, but Giorgi was able to resume the throne with Ottoman support.  Accession  Giorgi II Gurieli succeeded on the death of his father Rostom Gurieli in 1564. The entire length of his reign saw continuation of political strife, territorial disputes, plots and counterplots, jealousies and feuds among the rulers of a now-fragmented Georgia, occurring against the background of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into western Georgia and the Ottoman–Safavid rivalry in the Caucasus. In modern historiography, he is sometimes assigned the regnal number \\"III\\" by virtue of his being the third Giorgi with the style of Gurieli, the first being a son of Kakhaber I Gurieli in the 14th century and the second being Giorgi Gurieli, ruling from 1483 to 1512.  Conflict with Dadiani  In 1568, Gurieli supported his nominal royal suzerain, King George III of Imereti, against Levan I Dadiani, who was expelled from Mingrelia. Beyond political and territorial disputes, the Gurieli–Dadiani conflict also had personal dimensions: Gurieli's pride was wounded by repudiation of his sister by her husband, Levan Dadiani's son Giorgi; Giorgi Gurieli responded by marrying and then divorcing Levan's daughter. The ousted Dadiani returned with an Ottoman force and compelled Gurieli to buy peace for 10,000 dirhams. Shortly after Levan's death in 1572, Giorgi Gurieli invaded Mingrelia and deposed Levan's successor and his former son-in-law Giorgi Dadiani in favor of Mamia IV Dadiani, whom he then gave his sister in marriage. The king of Imereti intervened in 1578 and, having extracted territorial concessions from Giorgi Dadiani, brokered a deal between the two Giorgis: the deposed Dadiani was allowed to resume his reign in exchange of paying an indemnity to Gurieli for the past offences such as his abandonment of his first wife, Gurieli's sister. As Giorgi Dadiani was short of money, he had to surrender to Gurieli Khobi until the due amount of gold was extracted in full from that town. Around 1580, Giorgi Gurieli profited from yet another disorder in Mingrelia. Giorgi Dadiani's uncle Batulia, the lord of Sajavakho, whom the Mingrelian ruler had earlier humiliated by taking his wife, plotted a revolt. Dadiani mobilized his loyal forces in time; Batulia had to flee to Guria. In exchange of capturing the rebel, Gurieli took Sajavkho for himself and then allowed Dadiani's agents to kill Batulia in a prison in Ozurgeti.  Raid in Kartli  While the Georgian rulers were preoccupied with their own struggles, a new war between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia had erupted in 1578. The Ottomans, who claimed suzerainty over all of western Georgia, compelled the king of Imereti, Gurieli, and Dadiani to join war efforts against the Safavid-dominated Kingdom of Kartli in eastern Georgia in 1581. The three crossed into the marchlands of Kartli, found the locals in flight, burned down the emptied villages, and returned with no losses.  Deposition and comeback  In 1582, Giorgi Gurieli's old adversary Giorgi Dadiani died and the princely throne of Mingrelia was taken over by his brother Mamia IV Dadiani, Gurieli's son-in-law, who persuaded Gurieli to capture and incarcerate his underage nephew Levan. Mamia then exploited the boy's death in a defenestration accident as a pretext to attack Guria in 1583. Giorgi Gurieli was defeated and replaced with Dadiani's protégé, Vakhtang I Gurieli. In his flight from Guria, Giorgi had to recourse to the Ottoman support and repaired to Constantinople. In 1587, aided by the death of Vakhtag, he succeeded in resuming his rule.  Intervention in Imereti  In 1589, Giorgi Gurieli intervened in a chaotic civil war in the Kingdom of Imereti. He had his own nominee to the throne of Imereti, Bagrat IV, whom he installed as king after defeating and expelling Rostom, a Mingrelian protégé, from Kutaisi. Gurieli left his son Mamia, to protect Bagrat and, with the help of a Turkish force, destroyed the fortress of Sebeka, possessed by the Chijavadze family, in the Imeretian borderlands, on his way back to Guria. Bagrat was quickly deposed by King Simon I of Kartli, who sought to bring all of Georgia under his scepter.  Death  According to the 18th-century historian Prince Vakhushti, Giorgi Gurieli died in 1600, the dating supported also by one contemporary document and generally accepted in modern scholarship. On the other hand, a note attached to the 17th-century liturgical collection (gulani) from the Shemokmedi Monastery dates Giorgi's death to 1598. He was succeeded by his son Mamia II Gurieli.  Family  Giorgi II Gurieli was married twice. He first married, c. 1566, a daughter of Levan I Dadiani, whom he divorced and married, c. 1582, Tamar, of the Shervashidze family, the widow of Giorgi III Dadiani. He had three children: * Prince Mamia II (died 1625), Prince-regnant of Guria (1600–1625); * Princess Rodam, who married, in 1571, Mzechabuk Jaqeli (died 1572), a son of Kaikhosro II Jaqeli, atabag of Samtskhe; * Prince Malakia (died 1641), Catholicos of Abkhazia (1619–1641).

Cato Salonianus was born in 154 BC, and lived to obtain the praetorship, but then died in office, leaving two sons, Marcus and Lucius.

Since Caepio died during the Social War, he and Livia must have been divorced. The cause is not known, but it might have been the result of the enmity that developed between Caepio and his brother-in-law, Marcus Livius Drusus, although they had previously been close friends.

I, pp. 645, 1076 (\\"Porcius Cato\\", No. 6, \\"Stemma Drusorum\\"), vol. II, p. 788 (\\"Livia\\", No. 1). Career Cato was tribune of the plebs in an uncertain year, probably early in the first decade of the first century BC. Broughton assigns his tribunate to 99 BC, in which year the tribunes Cato and Quintus Pompeius Rufus attempted to recall Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus from exile. This bill was opposed by Gaius Marius, a prominent general and rival of Numidicus, and with his support the proposal was vetoed by the tribune Publius Furius. Drumann identifies this Cato as Lucius, the brother of Marcus, but the year of his tribunate is equally uncertain.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 2, 3 (note 6).Drumann, Geschicte Roms, vol. V, p. 214.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 645 (\\"Porcius Cato\\", No. 6). Cicero relates an anecdote concerning a decision that Cato gave in a civil trial, relating to a vendor's duty to disclose hidden defects to a purchaser. A certain Claudius, having been ordered by the augurs to demolish his house on the Caelian Hill, because it obstructed the auspices, sold the house to the plaintiff, Calpurnius, without mentioning the demand of the augurs. When Calpurnius learned that his house was to be demolished, he brought suit against Claudius for fraud, and Cato rendered a decision in his favour, requiring Claudius to pay him damages.Cicero, De Officiis, iii. 16. Death At the time of his death, which occurred some time before the outbreak of the Social War in 91 BC, Cato was a candidate for the praetorship. Livia also died while her children were young. They were raised in the household of their uncle, Marcus Livius Drusus. Both Drusus and Caepio were killed in the Social War, as was Cato's brother, Lucius, during his consulship in 89 BC. Marcus Cato had been a friend of the general Sulla, who took an interest in his son after Cato's death.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Cato the Younger\\", 1–3. Cato's daughter, Porcia, married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who became consul in 54 BC.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Cato the Younger\\", 1, 41.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xiii. 37, 48.

The singular form (Nav or Nawia) is also used as a name for an underworld, over which Veles exercises custody—it is often interpreted as another name for the underground variant of the Vyraj (heaven or paradise). Etymology The words nawia, nav and its other variants are most likely derived from the Proto-Slavic *navь-, meaning \\"corpse\\", \\"deceased\\". As souls or spirits The nawie, nawki, sometimes also referred to as lalki (all plural forms) was used as a name for the souls of the dead. According to some scholars (namely Stanisław Urbańczyk, among others), this word was a general name for demons arising out of the souls of tragic and premature deaths, killers, warlocks, the murdered and the Drowned Dead. They were said to be hostile and unfavourable towards humans, being jealous of life. In Bulgarian folklore there exists the character of 12 navias that sucked the blood out of women giving birth, whereas in the Ruthenian Primary Chronicle the navias are presented as a demonic personification of the 1092 plague in Polotsk. According to folk tales, the nawie usually took the form of birds. As an underworld The phrase Nawia or Nav was also utilised as a name for the Slavonic underworld, ruled by the god Veles, enclosed away from the world either by a living sea or river, according to some beliefs located deep underground. According to Ruthenian folklore, Veles lived on a swamp in the centre of Nav, where he sat on a golden throne at the base of the Cosmic Tree, wielding a sword. Symbolically, the Nav has also been described as a huge green plain—pasture, onto which Veles guides souls. The entrance to Nav was guarded by a Zmey. It is highly likely that these folk beliefs were the inspiration behind the neopagan idea of Jav, Prav and Nav in the literary forgery known as the Book of Veles.

Background =The railway line= The accident location at Merișor is situated on the line between Filiași to Simeria, commonly known as the \\"Jiu Valley Line\\", since it crosses the Charpatian Mountains along with the Jiu river, being considered one of the most scenic railway lines in Romania. The exact section at Merișor is situated on the Petroşani to Subcetate segment of the line, known for its steep inclines and twisty sections as its leaving the Petroşani basin trying to cross a hilly area to get to the Hațeg basin. When the line was electrified on 31 October 1973, a neutral section was installed a few hundred meters from the accident location, which soon became known as \\"the hardest neutral section in Romania\\" due to the fact that its situated on a steep gradient and that trains cannot go at speeds higher than 30 km/h in the area, due to the poor maintenance of the railway line. The line at the site of the accident was designed to take speeds of 60 km/h at most. =The train= The train was made out of a CFR Class 40 locomotive, commonly classed as the LE 5100 series made by Electroputere Craiova, and 16 E-type carriages, normally used for carrying gravel, waste iron, logs, etc. The exact locomotive in question was 40-0759-7, it was made at the Electroputere works in 1983, and previously it had serviced in Bulgaria around 2008–2009, being used by \\"Unitranskom\\" at Burgas. At the time of the accident it was refurbished, but it is believed that the compressor failed. Another theory is that the INDA-type throttle installation was jammed in a superior position that would have reduced the efficiency of the braking and failed to reduce the traction motor current intensity. 40-0759-7 was also involved in another incident relating to overspeeding on inclines near Predeal before the accident. The railway company who owned this locomotive, Unicom Tranzit was apparently involved in multiple train accidents/incidents during the time period before and after this accident, and many safety irregularities have came out after the accident. However the operating licence of this company was not suspended. Accident The map of the accident location When the accident occurred the train was en route from Slatina to Curtici, carrying waste iron. Whilst en route from Petroşani to Subcetate, near the village of Bănița, the train driver and helper noticed that the train was speeding uncontrollably and whilst trying to slow down, the train drivers also noticed the brake systems failed. The runaway train derailed on a bridge in a curve after overspeeding (entering the curve at 95 to 100 km/h, on a 30 km/h zone), killing both train drivers and destroying most of the consist in the process. The damage was severe. The locomotive was severely damaged whilst most of the freight cars got destroyed, falling into a river ten meters below. The railway line also suffered damage too, with most of the trackside objects and OHLE being destroyed in the process.

Early life John Moore was born in London on 3 April 1814.

In September 1848, he made his first appearance on the American theater scene, playing Flitterman in James Planché's \\"Somebody Else\\" at the Park Theatre. Career as a stage manager The majority of Moore's career was spent as a stage manager and prompter at various theaters in New York, and was described in his obituary as \\"the most noted in his calling of any in the country.\\" By 1852, Moore had become a prompter at the Bowery Theatre. In the late 1850s, he was the stage manager at Burton's Theatre. In the early 1860s, he returned to the Park Theatre, then under the management of Frederick and Sarah Conway, as stage manager. Several years later, he joined the staff of Wallack's Theatre. Around 1870 (or possibly 1874, according to his obituary), he became the stage manager at Augustin Daly's theatre, where he stayed for twenty-three years. He occasionally took on small acting roles, such as Vincentio in Daly's 1886 revival of The Taming of the Shrew, Shallow in The Merry Wives of Windsor the same year, and a groom in Daly's 1875 production of Richard II featuring Edwin Booth in the title role. Death and legacy Moore died in New York City on 11 January 1893 after several years of ill health. He was survived by a son and daughter. Moore was described as \\"one of the most genial and companionable men who ever lived.\\" He was an avid book collector and owned a large theatrical library, which he left to Daly. Portions of Moore's collection, including many of his detailed promptbooks, later ended up in the Harvard Library system and the Folger Shakespeare Library.

In 2017 he became the second horse trained in Scotland to win the Grand National. Background One For Arthur is a bay gelding with a white blaze bred in Ireland by J P Dwan. He was sold as a yearling for €14,000 and made €34,000 when returning to the sales ring as a three-year-old. In December 2014 he was again put up for auction at the Brightwells Cheltenham sale and was bought for £60,000 by the trainer Lucinda Russell. He entered the ownership of Deborah Thomson and Belinda McClung who formed the Two Golf Widows partnership after their respective partners took to spending most of their weekends on the golf course. He has been trained throughout his professional racing career at Arlary near Kinross in Scotland by Russell, assisted by her partner Peter Scudamore. He was sired by Milan, who won the St Leger and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Turf in 2001. Milan's other progeny include Jezki, and Darlan. His dam Nonnetia, who won one race over hurdles in France, was a granddaughter of Wavy Reef, the female-line ancestor of the Irish St. Leger winner Duncan. Racing career =2013/2014 National Hunt season= One For Arthur began his racing career on the amateur point-to-point circuit and was beaten in his first four races before winning at the Lingstown meeting in November 2013. When moved up to compete against professional competition following his move to Russell's yard in early 2014 he finished second in a National Hunt Flat race at Newcastle Racecourse in February and a Novice Hurdle at Kelso in March. =2014/2015 National Hunt season= As he had failed to win under professional rules One For Arthur was campaigned in novice hurdles in the 2014/2015 season.

He won again at Ayr in March but when stepped up in class for the Sefton Novices' Hurdle at Aintree Racecourse in April he started a 40/1 outsider and was pulled up in a race won by Thistlecrack. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= In the 2015/2016 season One For Arthur was campaigned in novice steeplechases and made a successful debut over the larger obstacles when winning at Kelso in October. He failed to win again in six subsequent races that season, but ran consistently, finishing second once and third on three occasions, =2016/2017 National Hunt season= On his first appearance of the 2016/2017 National Hunt season One For Arthur started 5/2 favourite for a handicap at Kelso in October and won by six lengths after taking the lead at the penultimate fence. In December he was tried over the Grand National course at Aintree and finished fifth of the 22 runners behind Vieux Lion Rouge in the Becher Chase. In the Classic Chase at Warwick Racecourse on 4 January One For Arthur was assigned a weight of 151 pounds and started at odds of 14/1 in a field of 20 chasers. He took the lead at the second last fence and drew away to win by six lengths from Goodtoknow. One For Arthur was assigned a weight of 10-11 (151 pounds) for the Randox Health Grand National over four and a quarter miles at Aintree and started at odds of 14/1 in a forty-runner field. He was ridden by Derek Fox who had just returned from injury having sustained a broken wrist and a dislocated collarbone in a fall on 9 March. One For Arthur raced towards the rear of the field before beginning to make progress early on the second circuit. He moved into contention three fences out, at which point the favourite Blaklion had opened up a clear advantage. One For Arthur overtook the favourite approaching the final obstacle and stayed on up the run-in to win by four and a half lengths from Cause of Causes, with Saint Are taking third ahead of Blaklion. He became the second horse trained in Scotland to win the race, following Rubstic's victory in 1979. After the race Fox said \\"It's the best feeling I've ever had. He's just such a brave horse. It's a sign of a true racehorse to win the Grand National. It's unbelievable... I don't often get a chance to ride a horse as good as that\\". Russell commented \\"I am so proud of the horse. He jumped fantastically and Derek gave him a great ride. He has done us proud, done Scotland proud and done everyone at the yard proud\\".

He became a teacher of theology at the abbey. Later, he took over the parish of Schluchsee. On 21 June 1793 he gave the eulogy at the graveside of the abbot, Martin Gerbert.

Early life  Fraze was born on a farm near Muncie, Indiana, but later moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he assembled novelties for Cracker Jack boxes.  Career  He started his career in Ohio as a machine tool operator in the 1940s. Using a loan from his wife, Martha, he established the Dayton Reliable Tool & Manufacturing Company, his own machine tool business in 1949. The company produced tools such as improved gun barrels for war planes, including the NASA, General Electric, and Ford. Fraze patented many of his innovations later graduated from Kettering University. In 1959, while at a picnic with friends and family, Fraze discovered he had left his \\"church key\\" can opener at home, forcing him to use a car bumper to open cans of beer. Fraze decided to create an improved beverage opening method that would eliminate the need for a separate device, leading to his creation of the pull-tab opener. His first design included a lever that pierced a hole in the top of the can, but this caused a safety hazard as it produced sharp edges that could cut the user's finger. Later that year, he established a mechanism known as the \\"pull- tab\\" can, with its users simply being required to pull a removable tab to open the drink. He received U.S. patent No. 3,349,949 for the invention in 1963, and subsequently sold it to Alcoa. By 1965, around 75% of U.S. breweries were using them, but in the mid-1970s, pressure from environmentalists due to litter led to the development of the non-removable tabs used today. By 1980, his company was supplying can-end machinery worldwide making over $500 million in annual revenue.  Death  Fraze died in 1989, in Kettering, Ohio from a brain tumor. Soon after his death, the family sold the Dayton Reliable Tool Company to business managers, but the business remained in Dayton.

Life  Walter König was born on 25 of June 1903 in Bielitz, in a Jewish family. No sooner did Poland regain its independence than he acquired Polish citizenship. He spent his early life in Bielitz. Having had finished school, he headed for Vienna to study at the local university. Unfortunately, as Austria did not recognize dual citizenship, he had to renounce Polish citizenship. In 1925 he patented the manufacture of objects of early plastics. In 1930, Eng. König founded the \\"Rogolith\\" company in Bielsko, which produced buttons from these artificial materials. About 60 people were employed in this company. In 1938 he was baptized. At the end of the 1930s König also applied for Polish citizenship. However, it was not easy, even though he married a Polish woman. His attempt was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. While many Polish citizens of German origin living in Bielsko supported the Wehrmacht and conducted sabotage against the Polish soldiers, Walter König volunteered to join the Polish Army. After losing the September campaign he was sent to the Soviet Union. There, due to his education, he was sent to Siberia, where he was involved in infrastructure development. Though, he still wanted to fight for Poland's freedom. Despite his efforts, he failed to join General Anders's Army. It was not until 7 November 1943 that he became a private soldier in the 5th Heavy Artillery Brigade in Sletsy. Later on, he participated in numerous battles, including liberation of Warsaw, Oder-crossing and battle of Berlin. When he returned to Bielsko, it came to light that he did not have Polish citizenship. The new communist regime suggested that he should go to Germany. His past as an industrialist was also a detriment. In 1946, however, he managed to bring his wife back from the USSR, and a year later he was called to receive Polish citizenship. Sadly, his button factory was taken away from him. König found work in a building materials' warehouse. For the next years he was subject to surveillance and even arrested under false charges of stealing materials from his workplace. At the end of his life, he fell seriously ill.

Roberts (born Feb.5, 1965 in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American applied mathematician, the Executive Director of the American Mathematical Society, and a professor of mathematics at the College of the Holy Cross.  Education  Roberts graduated, magna cum laude, from Bowdoin College in 1987 with an A.B. in Mathematics & Art History and a teacher certification in math. She graduated from Northwestern University in 1992 with a Ph.D in Applied Mathematics & Engineering Sciences.  Professional career  Roberts was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Rhode Island from 1992-1995. She then was appointed an assistant professor at Northern Arizona University from 1995-1998 and from 1998-2001 she worked as an associate professor at that same University. Roberts was appointed an associate professor at the College of the Holy Cross from 2001-2013 and a full professor from 2013-2018. From 2004-2016 she served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Natural Resource Modeling journal. Roberts is the Executive Director of the American Mathematical Society, having been appointed in 2016.  Research  Roberts' research focused on the analysis of nonlinear Volterra integral equations that arise in studies involving diffusive media as well as the mathematical modeling of interactions between humans and their natural environment. The objective of these studies is to investigate the phenomena of explosion, quenching, and anomalous diffusion within a diffusive medium in the context of nonlinear Volterra integral equations. These problems are characterized by spatially localized nonlinearities, distinguishing them from the work of earlier researchers. Such nonlinearities are motivated, for example, by applications where the event occurs within a very confined area (e.g., flooding events in porous media, internal electrode energy stimulation on a heated surface). These phenomena are of wide importance in applications. Studies of explosion have been conducted on theoretical models that are originally presented as nonlinear partial differential equations. Unlike previous studies, which have required a smoothness property for spatially dependent nonlinearities, this research replaces such requirements by strongly localized behavior. In this case, conversion of the theoretical models from partial differential equations to integral equations represents a very effective format for the analysis. This reformulation permits a more direct and efficient inquiry into the challenging scenario of spatially localized nonlinear behavior. Her work with interactions between humans and their natural environment sought to characterize complex human-environment interactions in a recreational setting. Specifically, the research studied problems related to human decision-making and how it influences the routing of recreational white water rafting traffic on rivers. This research developed traffic models that simulate the responses of humans to an ever-changing natural environment. Roberts developed the Grand Canyon River Trip Simulator. This model uses artificial intelligence and statistical techniques to capture the unique nature of this interaction.  Personal life  Roberts was born in 1965 in Boston, Massachusetts. Her family subsequently moved to Cape Cod, Massachusetts where her father opened a law practice and her mother became an important civic leader and social advocate in the community. Roberts enjoyed a happy childhood growing up with her 3 sisters. She loved her childhood of swimming in the ocean and the ponds of Cape Cod. Roberts met her spouse while living in Chatham and attending high school. Roberts' spouse is a chemistry professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. She and her husband have two sons both currently attending colleges.

Along with KaiA and KaiC, KaiB plays a central role in operation of the cyanobacterial circadian clock. Discovery of the Kai genes marked the first-ever identification of a circadian oscillator in a prokaryotic species. Moreover, characterization of the cyanobacterial clock demonstrated the existence of transcription-independent, post-translational mechanisms of rhythm generation, challenging the universality of the transcription-translation feedback loop model of circadian rhythmicity.  Discovery  =Prokaryotic circadian rhythms= Circadian rhythms - endogenous, entrainable oscillations in biological processes with periods that roughly correspond to the 24-hour day – were once believed to be an exclusive property of eukaryotic lifeforms. Prokaryotes were thought to lack the cellular complexity to maintain persistent, temperature-compensated timekeeping. In addition, the widely supported \\"circadian- infradian rule\\" stipulated that cellular functions could only be coupled to a circadian oscillator in cells dividing only as fast as once in a 24-hour period. Prokaryotes, which often undergo cellular division multiple times in a single day, failed to meet this condition. Over time, mounting evidence began to challenge this assertion. For example, discrete temporal separation of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation observed in cyanobacteria suggested the existence of some mechanism of circadian control. Finally, in 1986 Tan-Chi Huang and colleagues discovered and characterized robust, 24-hour rhythms of nitrogen fixation in Synechococcus cyanobacteria, demonstrating circadian rhythmicity in a prokaryotic species. Following these discoveries, chronobiologists set out to identify the molecular mechanisms governing operation of the cyanobacterial clock. =Discovery of the cyanobacterial clock= Takao Kondo, Carl Johnson, and Susan Golden used bacterial luciferase, a reporter for gene expression, on the gene psbAI to monitor the activity of this clock gene found in Synechococcus cyanobacteria. The transformation of a 44 hour long-period clock mutant, C44a, with wild-type (WT) genomic DNA library in a plasmid vector allowed testing for “rescue clones” with a normal period of 25 hours. When the DNA library from this rescued clone was placed into a plasmid at the original site, C44a was found to be completely rescued. One single gene cluster, kaiABC, was found to be rhythmic in nature when the fragment of the plasmid responsible for rescue was sequenced. kaiABC is composed of three individual genes: kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC. Examination of rescue patterns in over 50 clock mutants showing either short periods, long periods or arrhythmia revealed restoration to WT phenotype in all mutants. Further sequencing revealed 19 total kaiABC specific mutants, 14 of which had mutations in kaiC, 3 in kaiA, and 2 in kaiB. The mutant phenotypes being all caused by a single amino acid substitution on one of the aforementioned genes determined that Kai proteins play a significant role in the Synechococcus circadian clock. Initially, it was thought that a transcription-translation feedback loop was necessary in creating circadian rhythms so it was believed that kaiABC would have this function as well. However, it was later discovered that inhibition of kaiBC mRNA accumulation using a transcription or translation inhibitor did not prevent the circadian cycling of kaiC phosphorylation. Thus, it is the case that cyanobacterial clock rhythmicity is independent of both transcription and translation. Additionally, experiments were conducted to test the self-sustainable oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation, which is important in the regulation of the kaiABC gene cluster. By incubating KaiC together with KaiA and KaiB, as well as ATP, the temperature compensation aspect of the KaiABC clock was proved. Additionally, such circadian periods seen in kaiC in vivo mutants were also observed in in vitro strains.  Evolutionary history  Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic, nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are known to be one of the first life forms on Earth, and are thought to have emerged at least 3,500 million years ago (Mya). They are the only known oxidative photosynthetic prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use circadian clocks to regulate nitrogen-fixation, cell division, and other metabolic processes. The vast majority of cyanobacterial genes are expressed in a circadian fashion, generally falling into Class I (dusk-peaking) and Class II (dawn-peaking) categories depending on their specific function. The rhythmic expression of cyanobacterial genes is driven by oscillation in the phosphorylation state of the Kai oscillator and its interaction with various output mechanisms. The evolution of the three kai genes – kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC – remains an area of active study. Recent phylogenetic evidence suggests that the kai genes emerged sequentially: kaiC nearly 3,800 Mya, kaiB between 3,500-2,3200 Mya, and kaiA most recently around 1,000 Mya. The fusion of kaiC and kaiB into an operon under the control of a single promoter occurred shortly after kaiB’s appearance in the genome. While all three kai genes are independently required for sustained circadian rhythmicity in cyanobacteria, the kaiA gene is restricted to a group of higher-order cyanobacteria. For example, while the Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cyanobacterial genera are closely related, kaiA is absent in Prochlorococcus species. Cyanobacteria lacking kaiA demonstrate oscillations in gene expression and cell cycle progression, but these rhythms are not self-sustaining and rapidly disappear under constant conditions. Contrasting cyanobacterial species lacking kai genes, some members of the Synechococcus family express paralogs of kaiB and kaiC referred to as kaiC2, kaiB2, kaiC3, and kaiB3. The function this expanded set of clock genes remains speculative, but current evidence suggests these paralogs help to fine-tune a central circadian rhythm established by kaiA, kaiB1, and kaiC1. Orthologs of kaiB and kaiC genes have been identified in some species of Archaea and Proteobacteria. Likely originating from lateral transfer, some of these orthologs – particularly in cases where kaiB and kaiC are coincident - have been tentatively implicated in rudimentary timekeeping mechanisms. Others play roles in strikingly divergent cellular processes, such as the Legionella pneumophila oxidative and salt stress responses.  Function  =Role in the circadian clock= The core cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, encoded by the kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC genes, regulates global patterns of gene expression and governs essential cellular processes including photosynthesis and cell division. Cyclic, sequential rhythms of KaiC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation constitute the oscillator’s timekeeping mechanism both in vivo and in vitro. KaiC is organized as a ring-shaped homohexamer. Each monomer component contains four essential structural motifs: a CI domain, a CII domain, a B-loop binding domain, and a tail that protrudes from the C-terminus known as the A-loop. Because the CI and CII domains are aligned in the KaiC hexamer, they are collectively referred to as the CI and CII rings. KaiC has both intrinsic autokinase and autophosphate activity, each of which can be modulated by KaiA and KaiB binding. In particular, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues Ser431 and Thr432 in the CII ring drive circadian rhythms in the Kai oscillator. At the start of the subjective day, the Ser431 and Thr432 residues of the KaiC hexamer are unphosphorylated, and the A-loop domains of its constituent monomers are exposed. KaiA binds to the A-loop domain of KaiC, promoting autokinase activity. Phosphorylation of the protein occurs in an ordered, sequential manner – Thr432 is phosphorylated first, followed by Ser431. Phosphorylation of the Ser431 residue drives a significant conformational change in the KaiC hexamer. The CI and CII rings of the protein complex stack more tightly, exposing the previously occluded B-loop. The B-loop in turn recruits KaiB, which simultaneously binds to KaiA and KaiC. KaiB binding removes KaiA from the A-loop, and in turn both promotes the autophosphatase activity of KaiC and inhibits its autokinase activity. Dephosphorylation of KaiC occurs in the subjective night, and proceeds in the reverse order of phosphorylation; Thr432 is dephosphorylated before Ser431. Ultimately, these circadian rhythms in KaiC phosphorylation governed by KaiA and KaiB binding create a post-translation oscillator that can interact with both input pathways to entrain to changing environmental conditions and output pathways to mediate transcriptional events. Cyclic rhythms in phosphorylation of the KaiC hexamer serve as a timekeeping mechanism for the cyanobacterial Kai oscillator. Circles shaded red represent phosphorylated residues. =Circadian outputs and KaiB fold switching= Though the Kai oscillator is capable of generating endogenous rhythms in phosphorylation, it does not directly influence gene expression; none of the Kai proteins possess DNA- binding domains. Instead, a two-component system consisting of SasA, a histidine kinase, and RpaA, a transcription factor, connect changes in KaiC phosphorylation to transcriptional events. SasA can bind to the exposed B-loop of the KaiC molecule upon phosphorylation of the Ser431 residue. This interaction drives SasA autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphotransfer to RpaA. Phospho-RpaA activates the expression of dusking-peaking (Class 1) genes and represses the expression of dawn-peaking (Class 2) genes. Conversely, unphosphorylated RpaA represses the expression of Class 1 genes. As a result, rhythmic phosphorylation of the transcription factor, driven by the Kai oscillator and associated SasA activity, produces rhythmic patterns in gene expression. KaiB serves as a major regulator of the SasA-RpaA pathway, and exhibits structural adaptations that both contribute to circadian rhythm generation and facilitate interaction with SasA and KaiC. The majority of KaiB expressed in cyanobacteria exists as an inactive homotetramer, incapable of interacting with KaiC. The KaiB tetramer exists in equilibrium with a monomeric form of the protein. However, monomeric KaiB must undergo a radical change in tertiary structure to associate with KaiC, shifting from a so-called ground state conformation (gs-KaiB) to a fold-switched conformation (fs-KaiB) capable of binding to the KaiC B-loop. To date, KaiB is the only known metamorphic clock protein – a class of proteins capable of reversible fold- switching. Fs-KaiB has a thioredoxin-like fold that closely resembles the N-terminus of SasA, and competitively displaces the kinase’s binding to KaiC. However, the conformation change from gs-KaiB to fs-KaiB occurs slowly, permitting SasA binding to KaiC and downstream activation of RpaA from midday – when the B-loop first becomes exposed - until dusk. As a result, phospho- RpaA accumulates as the day progresses and peaks near dusk, appropriately timing increases in the expression of Class 1 genes. Moreover, this time-lag in KaiB binding delays the onset of autophosphatase activity in KaiC, contributing to the circadian period of the cyanobacterial oscillator. =Regulation of the Kai oscillator= While rhythmicity in the KaiABC oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro, the clock is subject to various additional levels of regulation in vivo. For example, a stoichiometric ratio of clock components must be maintained to preserve rhythmicity. kaiB and kaiC – whose transcript and protein levels oscillate considerable over the course of the day - constitute an operon under the control of a single promoter and are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. By contrast, protein levels of KaiA, which lies under the control of an independent promoter, remain fairly across a 24-hour period. In addition, the phase of the Kai oscillator can be shifted in response to environmental changes. However, unlike phase-shifting mechanisms characterized in eukaryotic organisms, photopigments do not appear to play a role in entrainment of the cyanobacterial clock. Instead, identified input mechanisms rely on biochemical changes that track photosynthetic reactions performed by the cyanobacterium, reactions that exhibit rate increases proportional to ambient light intensity. CikA and LdpA, for example, sense the redox state of the intracellular environment and relay changes to the Kai oscillator. In addition, KaiA and KaiC appear to directly detect metabolites of photosynthesis – specifically quinone and ATP – and adjust the phase of the oscillator accordingly. To date, KaiB has not been implicated in an input pathway capable of entraining the cyanobacterial clock.  Current research  Both Dr. Carl Johnson’s lab at Vanderbilt University and Dr. Michael Rust’s lab at the University of Chicago have research efforts focused on the KaiABC complex. The Johnson lab, in collaboration with Dr. Hassane Mchaourab’s lab, focuses on using biophysical methods to explain how the cyanobacteria clock oscillates in vitro. Additionally, they hope to discover the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms using clock gene mutants of cyanobacteria.\\"Carl Johnson Laboratory.\\" Carl Johnson Laboratory.
