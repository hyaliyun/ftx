InMoov is a robot developed for artistic purposes by French sculptor Gaël Langevinhttp://inmoov.fr/project/ in September 2011 (The first blueprint files were published in January 2012 on Thingiversehttps://www.thingiverse.com/tag:inmoov) Its peculiarity is that it is reproducible with a simple 3D printer small format (12cm3) and its files are under Creative Commons license (CC-BY-NC). The project is a platform for development and robot learning. On this basis and through this concept there were developed different iterations. InMoov uses MyRobotLab software for control. MyRobotLab is an open source service based robotics frameworkhttps://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/54951/. Its primarily written in Java[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html, but has bindings for Python. It has a Web UI written in AngularJS which allows remote control. One of the services is a virtual InMoov which can be used to develop or test without the physical robot. virtual InMoov InMoov is able to perceive sound, see, speak and move independently. The robot is able to identify its environment and through micro-cameras in some projects recognize voice commands that are issued by the owner. It features different touch sensors, PIR and 3 dimensional, in addition, the Kinect allows InMoov to see and analyze the 3-dimensional space of the robot's environment. Through the use of open technologies and open source components such as printed circuit Arduino, many developers have changed InMoov in order to extend its functions to be used as the basis for many types of development. The most ambitious is the artificial recognition programs because the robot incorporates on its single platform a micro-camera, sensors and operating motion system, and the ability to connect to any computer. The original prototype participated in the Maker Faire Rome in 2013, where he aroused great interest for its potential as a development model for robotic prostheses. Because its parts can be entirely made with a 3D printer, its potential uses are varied.

Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non- breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. The fish's natural diet includes zooplankton. Description The body of A. pacificus is pinkish brown dark brown, usually grading to yellowish or orange on lower side of body including abdomen. It is a member of the skunk complex with the characteristic white stripe along the dorsal ridge line, from the midline of the snout through to the base of caudal fin. The fins are whitish to semi-translucent. It has 9 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 18-20 dorsal soft rays and 12-13 anal soft rays. The four specimens that were the basis of the description ranged from . =Color variations= Some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location, sex and host anemone. A. pacificus, like other members of the skunk complex does not show any of these variations. =Similar species= A. akallopisos is almost identical, however there is a wide geographic separation such that geographic location is the easiest distinction. Despite the similarity in appearance, genetic results indicate that A. pacificus is well differentiated from A. akallopisos and is more closely related to A. sandaracinos which has a uniform coloration and the white stripe on the dorsal ridge extends onto the superior lip. 3 other species of anemonefish are found within its range, A. barberi, A. chrysopterus and A. clarkii, however these are easily distinguished by the absence of the white stripe on the dorsal ridge. Image:Amphiprion akallopisos 2010.JPGA. akallopisos (Skunk anemonefish) Image:Amphiprion sandaracinos.jpgA. sandaracinos (Orange anemonefish) showing the broader white stripe extending to the upper lip. Distribution and Habitat A. pacificus is found the western Pacific at Wallis Island, Tonga, Fiji and Samoan Islands, a regional hotspot of endemism. It is not common within its range and is generally found at depths of . =Host anemones= The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure. A. pacificus is highly specialised, being hosted by only 1 out of the 6 host anemones found in the region. A. pacificus is hosted by the following species of anemone: *Heteractis magnifica magnificent sea anemone Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation. A. pacificus has each of these characteristics, being an endemic species, with small local population and only one host anemone suggest that it is of particular conservation concern. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List.

He was also member of the Syrian Parliament. He is the author of several books. For his work as a scholar and military serviceman, Karamanoukian received medals from Egypt, Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, and France. Life and career Aram Karamanoukian was born on May 1910 in Aintab (today Gaziantep), Ottoman Empire to his father Hagop (Effendi) Karamanoukian, a lawyer by profession, and his mother Mariam Leylekian. During the Armenian Genocide, the Armenians of Aintab were deported and Karamanoukian, along with his family, were driven into the Syrian desert where they arrived in Hama and ultimately settled in Aleppo, Ottoman Syria. He received his early education at Atenagan and the Haigazian Lyceum in Aleppo, graduating from there in 1923. Setting aside his education for a few years, he briefly became a dentist in 1924. Thereafter, he resumed his education at the Marist Brothers College in Aleppo. Thereafter, in 1932, Karamanoukian entered the Syrian Military Academy in Damascus and specialized in artillery. After graduating from the academy in 1934, he was then transferred to France to the School of Applied Artillery where he received additional training from 1938 to 1939. He furthered his education at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, graduating from there in 1945 with the rank of officer. Returning to Syria, Karamanoukian was admitted into the newly formed Syrian Army and was responsible for various positions. He participated in the First Arab-Israeli war at the Quneitra front as the leader of the Syrian artillery regiment. From 1949 to 1957, he became the commander in chief of the Syrian Army's artillery. While serving this post, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1956. He was transferred to Washington D.C. where he served as a military attache to the Syrian embassy. After spending a year abroad, he retired from the military in 1958 and went into public service. In the same year, he married Hasmig Meghrigian, an Armenian American from New York City. He became a member of parliament in 1961 as an independent representing Aleppo. During his brief political career, he was elected as a member of the National Defense Commission. However, due to growing instability in the country, he retired from the political sphere in 1964 to further his education. In 1964, Karamanoukian returned to scholarly activity. He attended courses on law at Saint Joseph University in Beirut and graduated with a law degree. He was then accepted into the Sorbonne University in Paris. He continued his PhD studies there and eventually graduated with a LLD degree in 1972. His thesis was on military service and foreigners with a special emphasis on the French Armenian Legion. He became a United States citizen in 1990. He was then awarded by the New Jersey Association for Lifetime Learning as an Outstanding Adult Learner from Bergen County for the 1989–1990 academic year. During the Nagorno- Karabakh war, he visited various battlefronts. He was particularly elated about the Armenian victory at the Battle of Kalbajar. In the last months of his life, Karamanoukian toured around the world and visited friends and family in Syria, Armenia, France, and Lebanon. After returning to the United States, he fell gravely ill, and died in Fort Lee, New Jersey on 23 December 1996. In accordance to his will, his remains were transferred to Aleppo and Armenia. In Armenia, part of his remains were buried next to his brother Levon in Yerevan. In Aleppo, the rest of his remains were buried at a local Armenian church. His funeral was attended by many senior officials and dignitaries. Decorations Aram Karamanoukian received medals from Egypt, Armenia, Lebanon, Syria, and France. Some of Karamanoukian's awards and decorations include: * Knights of Cilicia medal (Armenian) * Nerses Shnorali medal (Armenian) * Croix de Guerre (French) * Officier de la Légion d'honneur (French) * Order of Merit (Lebanese) * Palestinian War Medal (Syrian) * Order of Civil Merit (Syrian) * Order of Military Merit (Syrian) Scholarly works * La double nationalité et le service militaire (1974) * Les étrangers et le service militaire (1978) =Books about Karamanoukian= * Zōravar Garamanukeani keankʻn u gortsĕ by Hasmik Garamanukean (in Armenian) References Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Gaziantep Category:Syrian Armenians Category:École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr alumni Category:Saint Joseph University alumni Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Syrian military personnel Category:Syrian generals Category:Military writers Category:Armenian Genocide survivors Category:People of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War Category:Grand Officiers of the Légion d'honneur Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre (France) Category:Members of the People's Council of Syria Category:Recipients of the Order of Civil Merit (Syria) Category:Recipients of the Order of Merit (Lebanon) Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Middle Eastern Christians Category:Syrian Christians Category:Armenian generals Category:Armenian military personnel ","title":"Aram Karamanoukian"},{"id":"47717491","text":"Hindustan Zinc Limited Ground is a cricket ground in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

The parish lies in Aarhus N 3 kilometers north-west of Aarhus city centre on the outskirts of the urban area. The parish has 816 inhabitants of which 655 are members of the Church of Denmark.  History  Skejby Church was built in the 12th century but not much is known from this period. Skejby was at the time a village, since incorporated as a neighbourhood in Aarhus, and the church functioned as the local church for that village. In 1420, on May 26, Skejby Church was annexed by the bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus in order to establish a parish and control the appointment of the priest. Between 1620 and 1631 the priest of Skejby Parish also became priest of the villages in Hasle and Lisbjerg. During the Swedish Wars in the 1630s and 1660s the church suffered from pillaging and loss of tithe as members of the congregation were impoverished. The church and parish has since been controlled by Aarhus bishopric until the state confiscated it during the reformation. In 1912 it became self-owning. The parish was annexed to Aarhus in 1962 and in 1966 Lisbjerg and Hasle were separated into their own independent parishes.  Church  The church is whitewashed with many visible granite ashlars and consists of a romanesque choir and nave. The tower with pinnacle adorned gables was built in the 1910 and the whitewashed chapel in gothic style 1904. Originally the church had a porch but it was torn down in 1816. The church is oriented towards the Sun.

In matters of faith, jurisprudence, and legislation, Quranists differ from ahl al-Hadith, who considered the Quran and Hadith to be the only legislative authority in matters of law and creed.. Quranism is similar to movements in other Abrahamic religions such as the Karaite movement in Judaism and the Sola scriptura view of Protestant Christianity. Terminology Adherents of Quranic Islam are referred to as \\"Quranists\\" (), but also as \\"reformists\\" or \\"progressive Muslims\\". Quranists should not be confused with Ahle-e-Quran (\\"People of the Quran\\"), which is an organisation formed by Abdullah Chakralawi. Quranists may also refer to themselves simply as \\"Muslims\\" or \\"Submitters\\". Doctrine Quranists believe that the Quran is the sole source of religious law and guidance in Islam and reject the authority of sources outside of the Quran like Hadith and Sunnah. And, citing Quranic verses like 6:38–39 and 6:114–115, they believe that the Quran is clear, complete, and that it can be fully understood without recourse to the hadith and sunna. Therefore, they use the Quran itself to interpret the Quran:Jens Zimmermann, Hermeneutics: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2015, pg. 90 > \\". . . .a literal and holistic analysis of the text from a contemporary > perspective and applying the exegetical principle of tafsir al-qur'an bi al- > qur'an (explaining the Qur'an with the Qur'an) and the jurisprudential > principle al-asl fi al-kalam al-haqiqah (the fundamental rule of speech is > literalness), without refracting that Qur'anic usage through the lens of > history and tradition.\\"Mahmoud Ayoub, Contemporary Approaches to the Qur'an > and Sunnah, International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), 2012, pg. 27 This method of interpreting the Quran is different from the method favored by most Sunni and Shia exegetes, known as tafsir bi-al-ma'thur (interpreting the Quran with narrations, i.e., hadiths). In contrast to Quranists, Sunnis do not believe that the Quran is fully detailed. They believe that, \\"the Qur'an needs the Sunnah more than the Sunnah needs the Qur'an (inna l-Quran ahwaju ila l-sunna mina l-sunna ila l-Quran)\\".Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an, Vol. 5, Brill, 2006, pg. 165 This methodological difference has led to considerable divergence between Quranists and Sunnis and Shia in matters of theology and law. For example, in the centuries immediately following Muhammad's death, Muslims who rejected hadiths did not believe in Naskh.Daniel W. Brown, Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought, Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 16-17 The Kufan scholar Dirar ibn Amr's rejection of hadith led him to reject the belief in Al-Masih ad-Dajjal, Punishment of the Grave, and Shafa'ah in the 8th century.Josef Van Ess, Theology and Society in the Second and Third Centuries of the Hijra. Volume 3, Brill, 2018, pp. 56-58 And the Egyptian scholar Muhammad Abu Zayd's rejection of hadith-based commentaries led him to reject the belief in the Isra and Mi'raj in the early 20th century. In his rationalist Quran commentary published in 1930, Al-hidaya wa-l-'Irfan fi tafsir al-Qur'an bi-l-Qur'an (Guidance and Instruction in Interpreting the Qur'an by the Qur'an), which uses the Quran itself to interpret the Quran, he claimed that verse 17:1 was an allusion to the Hegira and not Isra and Mi'raj.J. J. G. Jansen, The Interpretation of the Koran in Modern Egypt, E.J. Brill, 1980, pp. 87-89Egypt’s Quest for Cultural Orientation , Mafhoum.com, Accessed May 26, 2020 Syed Ahmad Khan argued that, while the Quran remained socially relevant, reliance on hadith limits the vast potential of the Quran to a particular cultural and historical situation.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.65 The extent to which Quranists reject the authority of the Hadith and Sunnah varies, but the more established groups have thoroughly criticised the authority of the Hadith and reject it for many reasons. The most common view being the Quranists who say that Hadith is not mentioned in the Quran as a source of Islamic theology and practice, was not recorded in written form until a century after the death of Muhammad, and contain internal errors and contradictions. For Sunni Muslims, \\"the sunnah\\", i.e the sunnah (the way) of the prophet, is one of the two primary sources of Islamic law, and while the Quran has verses enjoining Muslims to obey the Prophet, the Quran never talks about \\"sunnah\\" in connection with Muhammad or other prophets. The term sunnah appears several times, including in the phrase \\"sunnat Allah\\" (way of God), but not \\"sunnat al-nabi\\" (way of the prophet) -- the phrase customarily used by proponents of hadith.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.8 History =Early Islam= Quran from the 7th century written on vellum. Quranists date their beliefs back to the time of Muhammad, who prohibited the writing of hadiths.Aisha Y. Musa, Hadith as Scripture: Discussions on the Authority of Prophetic Traditions in Islam, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp.25-29 One of Muhammad's companions and successor Umar, also prohibited the writing of hadith and destroyed existing collections during his rule as Caliph. When Umar appointed a governor to Kufa, he told him: \\"You will be coming to the people of a town for whom the buzzing of the Qur'an is as the buzzing of bees. Therefore, do not distract them with the Hadiths, and thus engage them. Bare the Qur'an and spare the narration from God's messenger (peace and blessing be upon him)!\\". The centrality of the Quran in the religious life of the Kufans that Umar described was quickly changing, however. A few decades later, a letter was sent to the Ummayad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan regarding the Kufans: \\"They abandoned the judgement of their Lord and took hadiths for their religion; and they claim that they have obtained knowledge other than from the Koran . . . They believed in a book which was not from God, written by the hands of men; they then attributed it to the Messenger of God.\\"Aisha Y. Musa, Hadith as Scripture: Discussions on the Authority of Prophetic Traditions in Islam, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 37-38 In the following years, the taboo against the writing and following of hadiths had receded to such an extent that the Ummayad leader Umar II ordered the first official collection of Hadith. Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Hazm and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri, were among those who wrote Hadiths at Umar II's behest. Despite the trend towards hadiths, the questioning of their authority continued during the Abbasid dynasty and existed during the time of Al-Shafi'i, when a group known as \\"Ahl al-Kalam\\" argued that the prophetic example of Muhammad \\"is found in following the Quran alone\\", rather than Hadith.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.15-16excerpted from Abdur Rab, ibid, pp. 199–200. Later, a similar group, Ahl al-Tawḥīd wa l-ʿAdl, \\"people of monotheism and justice\\", known as the Mu'tazilites by their opponents, also viewed the transmission of the Hadith as not sufficiently reliable.Sabine Schmidtke, The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology, Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 264-265 The Hadith, according to them, was mere guesswork, conjecture, and bidah (innovation -as a quip/fabrication), while the book of God was complete and perfect, and did not require the Hadith to supplement or complement it.Azami, M. A., Studies in Hadith Methodology and Literature, Islamic Book Trust, Kuala Lumpur, 92; cited in Akbarally Meherally, Myths and Realities of Hadith – A Critical Study, (published by Mostmerciful.com Publishers), Burnaby, BC, Canada, 6; available at http://www.mostmerciful.com/Hadithbook-sectionone.htm ; excerpted from Abdur Rab, ibid, p. 200. There were prominent scholars who rejected hadith like Dirar ibn Amr. He wrote a book titled The Contradiction Within Hadith. However, the tide had changed from the earlier centuries to such an extent that Dirar was said to have been beaten up by the ashab al-hadith and had to remain in hiding until his death.Josef Van Ess, Theology and Society in the Second and Third Centuries of the Hijra. Volume 3, Brill, 2018, pp. 35-37 and 55-57 Like Dirar ibn Amr, the scholar Abu Bakr al-Asamm also had little use for hadiths.Josef Van Ess, Theology and Society in the Second and Third Centuries of the Hijra. Volume 2, Brill, 2017, pg. 461 During the Abassid dynasty, the poet, theologian, and jurist, Ibrahim an-Nazzam founded a madhhab called the Nazzamiyya that rejected the authority of oral Hadiths. His famous student, Al-Jahiz, was also critical of those who followed Hadith, referring to his Hadithist opponents as al-nabita (\\"the contemptible\\"). A contemporary of An-Nazzam, Al-Shafi'i, tried to refute the arguments of those who reject the Hadiths and establish the authority of Hadiths in his book Kitab Jima'a l-'Ilm. And Ibn Qutaybah tried to refute An-Nazzam's arguments against Hadith in his book Ta'wil Mukhtalif al-Hadith. =19th century= In South Asia during the 19th century, the Ahle Quran movement formed partially in reaction to the Ahle Hadith whom they considered to be placing too much emphasis on Hadith. Many Ahle Quran adherents from South Asia were formerly adherents of Ahle Hadith but found themselves incapable of accepting certain hadiths. Abdullah Chakralawi, Khwaja Ahmad Din Amritsari, Chiragh Ali, and Aslam Jairajpuri were among the people who promulgated Quranist beliefs in India at the time. =20th century= In Egypt during the early 20th century, the ideas of Quranists like Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi grew out of the reformist ideas of Muhammad Abduh, specifically a rejection of taqlid and an emphasis on the Quran.Rein Fernhout, Canonical Texts. Bearers of Absolute Authority. Bible, Koran, Veda, Tipitaka: A Phenomenological Study, Brill Rodopi, 1994, pp. 218-219 Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi of Egypt \\"held that nothing of the Hadith was recorded until after enough time had elapsed to allow the infiltration of numerous absurd or corrupt traditions.\\"Sidqi, Muhammad Tawfiq, Al-Islam huwa al-Qur'an wahdahu, al-Manar 9 (1906), 515; cited in Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi wrote an article titled Al-Islam Huwa ul-Qur'an Wahdahu ('Islam is the Qur'an Alone) that appeared in the Egyptian journal Al-Manar, which argues that the Quran is sufficient as guidance: \\"what is obligatory for man does not go beyond God's Book. If anything other than the Qur'an had been necessary for religion,\\" Sidqi notes, \\"the Prophet would have commanded its registration in writing, and God would have guaranteed its preservation.\\"Musa, Aisha Y., Hadith as Scripture: Discussions on the Authority of Prophetic Traditions in Islam, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008, p.6. Like some of their counterparts in Egypt such as Muhammad Abu Zayd and Ahmed Subhy Mansour, some reformist scholars in Iran who adopted Quranist beliefs came from traditional institutions of higher learning. Shaykh Hadi Najmabadi, Mirza Rida Quli Shari'at-Sanglaji, Mohammad Sadeqi Tehrani, and Ayatollah Borqei were educated in traditional Shia universities in Najaf and Qom. However, they believed that some beliefs and practices that were taught in these universities, such as the veneration of Imamzadeh and a belief in Raj'a, were irrational and superstitious and had no basis in the Quran.Said Amir Arjomand, Authority and Political Culture in Shi'ism, State University of New York Press, 1998, pp. 160-161 and 166-167 And rather than interpreting the Quran through the lens of hadith, they interpreted the Quran with the Quran (tafsir al-qur'an bi al- qur'an). These reformist beliefs provoked criticism from traditional Shia scholars like Ayatollah Khomeini, who attempted to refute the criticisms made by Sanglaji and other reformists in his book Kashf al-Asrar.Pillars, proofs and requirements of the Quran-Sufficiency Theory, along with its criticism , Profdoc.um.ac.ir, Accessed June 22, 2020A Criticism of the “Qura’n-through- Qura’n Interpretation Method” of the Shiite Quraniyan , Pdmag.info, Accessed June 22, 2020 Quran-centered beliefs have also spread among lay Muslims like Iranian American, Ali Behzadnia, who became Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare and acting Minister of Education shortly after the Iranian Revolution.

Some ways that swimmers can increase the risk of an injury are by overuse of a specific part of the body, lacking crucial flexibility and strength, etc. These injuries, like swimmer’s shoulder and breaststroker’s knee, cause pain to the swimmer in certain regions that permit necessary movement for the required precise technique. Although these injuries can halt a professional swimmer’s career, many can be treated and some can even be prevented. There are different procedures and exercises that can either prevent an injury or help with recovering from an injury. Many of the exercises are specific to the injury and vary in helpfulness according to the person and the technique used for the exercise. Compared to athletes who play other sports, competitive swimmers are at higher than average risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and teenagers.  Swimmer's shoulder  Swimmers shoulder is the name given to a broad range of shoulder injuries that occur in swimmers and results in pain felt within the shoulder and in areas surrounding the shoulder, including down the arm and up the neck. Pain associated with swimmers shoulder often starts as an irritating niggle when swim training and can persist to intense pain while swim training and also a constant pain while resting. While there are a number of contributing factor leading to the development of swimmers shoulder, it is believed that the two main causes of swimmers shoulder are overuse and the biomechanics of the stroke also known as stroke technique. The first cause of swimmers shoulder is overuse. Overuse of the shoulder muscles and surrounding muscles can lead to fatigue of the muscles. Due to the muscles being fatigued they are in a weakened state and with continuous use will therefore work less effectively when swimming and will result in the swimmer having to work the shoulder muscles twice as hard by taking double the number of strokes they would usually take in order to cover the same distance. This would ultimately result in more fatigue and inflammation of the muscles. Unilateral breathing may also cause swimmers shoulder due to the fact that the opposite shoulder to the breathing arm has to work harder to support balanced position and forward movement while the head is turned. Some training equipment such as paddles and kick boards can also put stress on the shoulder and surrounding muscles and cause fatigue and inflammation. The second cause of swimmer shoulder is the biomechanics of the stroke also known as stroke technique. Incorrect stroke technique for example the swimmers hand entering the water across the mid-line of the swimmers body then proceeding to stroke back or the swimmers hand entering the water palm out thumb down and any other type of incorrect technique when done repetitively can cause pain, fatigue and inflammation of the shoulder and surrounding muscles. = Treatment methods = thumb Some treatment methods include; warming up slowly prior to training, avoiding strokes and positions that cause pain (butterfly/freestyle), fixing any bad technique that could be causing the pain, adjusting the distance and frequency of training to avoid further overuse of the muscles, discontinue the use of paddles, increase kick sets to allow the shoulder to rest however limit the use of kickboards and avoid pulling sets. Increase the use of fins to assist with maintaining a good body position and to avoid drag, avoid dry land upper body weight training, ice the shoulder daily, consider the use of anti- inflammatory creams and medicines and seek the advice of a medical professional.  Breaststroker's knee  Breaststroker’s knee is the name given to pain felt within and around the knee that is experienced by swimmers. It is named this due to the fact it is most commonly only breaststrokers that experience pain within the knee and around the knee. Most swimmer will have no problems with their knees however ‘the majority (86%) of breaststroke swimmers will have experienced knee pain at one point in their career and 47.2% of them will have had this problem at least one time every week.’ There are several factors that increase the swimmers chances of developing knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles such as, the increasing age of the swimmer, the length of the competitive career, the length of the event, inadequate warm-up, strength imbalance of hip abductors/adductors and flexibility imbalance of hip abductors/adductors. = Prevention and treatment = In order to prevent the development of knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles it is recommended that swimmers use a well-designed strength and stretching program, warm-up adequately, use correct breaststroke kick technique, gradually build up the distance of breaststroke swimming and have a balanced training program that focuses on not only breaststroke and also has training sessions that allows for adequate recovery of the knee muscles to prevent fatigue of the muscles causing overuse, inflammation and pain. Treatment of breaststroker’s knee includes resting the knee muscles, icing daily, elevating the limb, strengthening and stretching, support e.g. strapping or knee braces, seeking medical advice which can lead to physiotherapy, cortisone injections and in few cases surgery.

The company now has over 190 employees and is based in Hamburg's HafenCity. It had a funding volume of over 9 million Euros in August 2015. In December 2014, the company launched their online platform. In October 2017 with 61 million euro annual investments it occupied 60% of the German real estate crowdfunding market. In January 2018, Exporo was the first crowdinvesting platform to launch a bond for its real estate project \\"Mitten in Hannover\\". The investment object consists of four existing buildings with 54 apartments and five commercial units in a central location in the state capital of Lower Saxony. The properties are held and managed by an Exporo subsidiary. Half of the financing is provided by investors and half by a bank loan. In June 2019, Exporo received a 43 million euros funding by German and international venture capital investors. About half of the sum was invested by Partech, a globally active VC specialist, which holds stakes in Auxmoney and Acatus, among others. In addition, the former shareholders Eventures, Holtzbrinck Ventures and Heartcore also participated in the funding.  Platform  Exporo was purposely built to serve self-directed investors instead of institutional ones. It offers investors an overview of real estate projects in which they can invest using their digital platform. Private investors benefit from two complementary product categories: # On the one hand, they can participate in high-yield real estate projects at short notice and at a fixed interest rate via Exporo Financing. # On the other hand investors can participate directly in selected portfolio properties via Exporo Equity by receiving quarterly distributions from the rent surpluses and additionally participating in the real estate value.  Internationalization  In August 2018, Exporo was offering its investors a real estate investment in other European countries. The project “Wohnen im 5. Bezirk\\" is located in the Margareten district of Vienna. Exporo investors financed EUR 1,690,000 with a fixed interest rate of 5.5% p.a. and a minimum term of approximately 16 months. After successfully completing its financing round mid 2019, Exporo is since looking to further expand to other foreign countries, mainly targeting the french and dutch markets.

Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict dominance hierarchy. Description A. thielli has reddish orange body, with a single white head bar that may be connected at the top with a bonnet and two saddles on the dorsal fin and tail base. They have 10-11 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 16 dorsal soft rays and 14 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . The species was described from two aquarium dealer specimens. Hybridisation In 1992 Fautin & Allen stated that until more specimens are studied, its status as a valid species was provisional and postulated that it might represent a rare variant of another species or a hybrid. More than 30 years after A. thielli was originally described, its scientific status does not appear to have been clarified, although the scientific consensus appears to be that it likely to be a naturally occurring hybrid. One theory is that it is a cross between A. chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos. A second theory is that it is a cross between A. ocellaris and A. sandaracinos. Some support for the latter theory comes from the observations that two thiellei have never been seen as a pair in the wild, and it often pairs with A. ocellaris in the wild. In any group of anemonefish, there is a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. This strict sized based dominance hierarchy makes the relative size of the parent species critical in shaping the outcome of hybridization In this regard A. chrysopterus is one of the largest anemonefish, growing to 17 cm in length. while A. sandaracinos is significantly smaller growing up to 11 cm as a female and just 3 to 6.5 cm as a male. A.. ocellaris is similarly small. Constraints upon hybridization are overlap in distribution, depth and host anemone. Each of the three proposed parents have a common host anemone in Stichodactyla mertensii. There is some doubt as to the distribution of A. chrysopterus with Fautin & Allen including the Philippines and Gainsford et al. excluding the Philippines. The distribution of A. sandaracinos and A. ocellaris largely overlap from northern Australia through the central Malay Archipelago to the Philippines. If they are the parents, is A. thiellei to be found throughout the overlapping distribution, and if not, why not?

Some species of anemonefish, such as A. clarkii show melanism when hosted by S. mertensii however the small number of observations of A. thiellei make no reference to any such melanism. =Similar species= A. perideraion has a pinkish body and a continuous white stripe along the base of the dorsal fin, rather than broken into a bonnet and two saddles. A. nigripes is distinguished by its black belly, pelvic fins and anal fin and the absence of the saddles on the dorsal fin and tail base.

Towards the end of the 19th century, a strong nationalist movement and identity arose within the Indian subcontinent, which was particularly prominent in Bengal, which by the start of 1900 had seen the beginnings of the Swadeshi movement, which drew a substantial contribution from the youth of Bengal. Leading nationalists saw the Calcutta University as a predominantly a Western Institution. Its focus on Western Themed philosophy and humanities at the expense of Indian ones, and the large number of ICS and administrative officers from amongst its graduates were seen to form the bulwark of British colonialism, and the Calcutta University came to be termed Goldighir Ghulamkhana (the slavehouse by the lake, with reference to a lake beside which the university was situated). Dawn society Satish Chandra Mukherjee, a Bengali Indian teacher who taught in the South Calcutta suburb of Bhowanipore, set up in 1895 the Bhagabat Chatushpati. This institute promoted history and understandings of Indian religions and philosophy. In 1897 he founded the Dawn Magazine and in 1902, Mukherjee founded the Dawn society. Through his society and magazine, Mukherjee promulgated Indian philosophies and teachings and criticized the Calcutta University's syllabus for its lack of emphasis on what he believed to be necessary for nation building. Mukherjee's work, in the nascent nationalist sentiments, found support among leading luminaries of Bengal at the time. Soon, the Dawn society was calling for nationalist education with an emphasis on sciences and focus towards Indian values. Universities act 1904 Lord Curzon had introduced the Universities act, 1904, much to the chargin of the native populace of Bengal who saw this as a means to limit access to English educational institutions from the native populations. The government also decided to disaffiliate many private Indian colleges, which had come up lately and were regarded by the Government as hot beds of nationalist agitation. The measures stirred the educated middle class to move for alternative systems of education. The real impetus though was provided by the partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General of India, into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become Bangladesh in 1971) and West Bengal and Odisha on the other. The young men of Bengal were amongst the most active in the Swadeshi movement, and the participation of university students drew the ire of the Raj. R.W. Carlyle prohibited the participation of students in political meetings on the threat of withdrawal of funding and grants. The decade preceding these decrees had seen Bengali intellectuals increasingly calling for indigenous schools and colleges to replace British institutions. National Council for Education On 10 December 1905, the Landholders Society organized a meeting at Park Street, attended by around 1500 delegates, including Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo Ghosh, Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick and Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury. The idea of the National Council of Education was mooted here. While in a meeting held on 9 November 1905 at the Field and Academic Club, Subodh Chandra Mullick pledged Rupees one lakh for the foundation of a National University in Bengal. The objective in setting up the institution that was to challenge the British rule over education by offering education to the masses 'on national lines and under national control'. Generous sums of money were also donated by Brojendra Kishore Roy Choudhury, Maharaja Suryya Kanto Acharya Choudhury and Rashbihari Ghosh, who was appointed the first president of the university. Aurobindo served as the first Principal of the college. The organisation in its early days was intricately associated with the nascent revolutionary nationalism in Bengal at the time. It was during his time as Principal that Aurobindo started his nationalist publications Jugantar, Karmayogin and Bande Mataram. The student's mess at the college was frequented by students of East Bengal who belonged to the Dhaka branch of the Anushilan Samiti, and was known to be hotbed of revolutionary nationalism, which was uncontrolled or even encouraged by the college.

He was arrested and executed in 1938 as part of the Great Purge during the Stalin period. Life =Career= Ikramov was born in 1898 in an Uzbek family in Tashkent, then part of the Russian Empire. In 1918 he joined the Communist Party.Keller; p.109 From 1921 to 1922 he was secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkestan. In 1922 he moved to Moscow where he studied at the Sverdlov Communist University. While in Moscow, Ikramov kept on campaigning within the Party for raising the cultural level of Turkestan by increasing literacy and building more schools. Fourth Conference of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) with Responsible Workers of the National Republics and Regions; June 9–12, 1923; response by Stalin: \\"I take upon myself some of the charges Ikramov made against the work of the Central Committee, to the effect that we have not always been attentive and have not always succeeded in raising in time the practical questions dictated by conditions in the Eastern republics and regions. Of course, the Central Committee is overburdened with work and is unable to keep pace with events everywhere. It would be ridiculous to think that the Central Committee can keep pace with everything. Of course, there are few schools in Turkestan. The local languages have not yet become current in the state institutions, the institutions have not been made national in character. Culture, in general, is at a low level. All that is true. But can anybody seriously think that the Central Committee, or the Party as a whole, can raise the cultural level of Turkestan in two or three years?\\" Meanwhile, Ikramov became involved in a power struggle among the Communists between those favoring a Pan-Turkist government like Turar Ryskulov, and those in favor of dividing the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into smaller ethnic or regional units, such as Fayzulla Khodzhayev and Ikramov. The latter group won, as national delimitation in Central Asia began in 1924. In January 1925 he became secretary of the Tashkent Oblast committee in the newly formed Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and was also for a time active as chief editor of the magazine Communist. In 1929, he became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and thus de facto head of government in Soviet Uzbekistan. He was the first ethnic Uzbek in this office, which he held until 1937. In 1930 his predecessor Isaak Zelensky tried to depose him, but since the Central Committee supported Ikramov, this attempt failed.Ikramov Akmal Ikramovich at rin.ru =Anti-religious policies= Ikramov bore the most responsibility for designing the specifics of the design of anti-Islamic actions during the first five-year plan. Sometimes he personally ordered the arrest of clergymen.Keller; p.124 Further measures to struggle against the clergy were taken, as Ikramov put it, \\"not by prohibitive measures, but by measures developed from broad party-organizational and cultural enlightenment work.\\"Keller; p.129 =Great Purge= Like many other early Communists, Ikramov fell victim to Stalin's Great Purge. Together with Khodzhayev he was arrested in 1937 and accused of anti-Soviet, Trotskyist activities, like being connected with agents of the British Intelligence Service.Andrei Vishinski, \\"The Treason Case Summed Up\\" ; 11 March 1938. From Soviet Russia Today, April 1938 Vol. 7 No. 2 In the following Case of the Anti-Soviet \\"Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites\\" Ikramov confessed being a British spy, and was quoted saying: \\"We had to rely on a strong European Power to help us. We thought England most reliable because she is so strong.\\" He was sentenced to death and shot on 13 March (other sources indicate 15 March) 1938. =Rehabilitation= During the Khrushchev Thaw, Ikramov's son Kamal requested that the first secretary of Uzbekistan rehabilitate his father. The secretary brought the case to Nikita Khrushchev personally, who then asked Vyacheslav Molotov to look at it. After a year, in 1957, Akmal Ikramov was reinstated in the Party, although the document reinstating him was classified as \\"Confidential.\\" Remembering Stalin's Victims: Popular Memory and the End of the USSR by Kathleen E.

Several techniques exist for decellularization with the majority based on detergent or enzymatic protocols which aim to eliminate all donor cells while preserving the mechanical properties of the remaining matrix. Top view of a fresh decellularized, non- seeded, aortic homograft with three pliable cusps.  Background  Aortic valve disease affects the valve between the left ventricle and the aorta, and can be present as a congenital condition at birth or caused by other factors. Several therapeutic options are open to patients once the indication for aortic valve replacement has been confirmed. One option is replacement using a mechanical valve. This, however, necessitates a strict lifelong anticoagulation regime to avoid cerebral thromboembolism. These blood thinners hold an inherent risk for severe bleeding episodes, which affects both professional and leisure activities and the majority of patients opt for mechanical valves for this reason. Biological prostheses, i.e. pericardial heart valves of animal origin (xenogenic), offer a viable alternative. However, in particular for young patients, it has been found that xenogenic valves do not provide satisfactory durability and rapid valve degeneration can occur within months.Svensson LG, Adams DH, Bonow RO, Kouchoukos NT, Miller DC, O'Gara PT, Shahian DM, Schaff HV, Akins CW, Bavaria JE, Blackstone EH, David TE, Desai ND, Dewey TM, D'Agostino RS, Gleason TG, Harrington KB, Kodali S, Kapadia S, Leon MB, Lima B, Lytle BW, Mack MJ, Reardon M, Reece TB, Reiss GR, Roselli EE, Smith CR, Thourani VH, Tuzcu EM, Webb J, Williams MR. Aortic valve and ascending aorta guidelines for management and quality measures. Ann Thorac Surg. 2013 Jun;95(6 Suppl):S1-66. A further avenue open to patients is a so- called Ross operation, an extensive surgical procedure in which the diseased aortic valve is replaced by the patient's pulmonary valve (autograft). The pulmonary valve then needs to be replaced by a heart valve prosthesis. A drawback of this method is that it can frequently result in a \\"two-valve\\" diseased heart, as almost all autografts are impaired by progressive dilatation in the long term, and the pulmonary valve prosthesis, often a conventional cryopreserved homograft, is subject to the same rate of degeneration as all biological valves. This can thereby lead to frequent reoperationsSievers HH, Stierle U, Charitos EI, Takkenberg JJ, Hörer J, Lange R, Franke U, Albert M, Gorski A, Leyh RG, Riso A, Sachweh J, Moritz A, Hetzer R, Hemmer W: A multicentre evaluation of the autograft procedure for young patients undergoing aortic valve replacement: update on the German Ross Registry.

In: Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2015 Feb;47(2):269-80.  Tissue engineering concepts  The lack of durable heart valve prostheses for young patients has driven forward research in tissue engineering approaches for valve replacement. Current tissue-engineering concepts are based on either artificial polymeric or biological scaffolds, derived from donated human tissue (allogeneic ) or animals (xenogenic). While more readily available, there have been reports of dramatic failure in the use of xenogeneic matrices in paediatric patients, leading to scepticism regarding their application.Kasimir MT, Rieder E, Seebacher G, Nigisch A, Dekan B, Wolner E, Weigel G, Simon P. Decellularization does not eliminate thrombogenicity and inflammatory stimulation in tissue-engineered porcine heart valves. J Heart Valve Dis. 2006 Mar;15(2):278-86. Total artificial tissue-engineered heart valve concepts are currently under development and would solve many unmet clinical demands, such as the permanent availability of different sizes and lengths. These concepts have shown good results in the technical implementation of valved polymeric conduit production and have successfully been used for in vitro and in vivo seeding of different (stem) cell lines. However, preclinical testing in long-term animal models has yet to deliver satisfactory results due to a lack of mechanical, leading to early failure of the valvular function.Emmert MY, Weber B, Behr L, Sammut S, Frauenfelder T, Wolint P, Scherman J, Bettex D, Grünenfelder J, Falk V, Hoerstrup SP.

Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2014 Jan;45(1):61-8. Conventional homografts Aortic valve replacement using a homograft was first performed over 50 years ago on 24 July 1962 by Donald Ross at Guy's Hospital, London and has been assessed in prospective randomized studies, e.g. in comparison to the Ross procedure.El-Hamamsy I, Eryigit Z, Stevens LM, Sarang Z, George R, Clark L, Melina G, Takkenberg JJ, Yacoub MH. Long-term outcomes after autograft versus homograft aortic root replacement in adults with aortic valve disease: a randomised controlled trial. Lancet. 2010 Aug 14;376(9740):524-31. Aortic valve replacement using conventional cryopreserved homografts is currently performed only in about 3% of all patients, mostly to treat acute aortic valve endocarditis.1 Severe calcification of conventional homografts frequently occurs and is the main reason for its restrictive use, however, current guidelines confirm homografts as a valid alternative for young patients requiring anatomical reconstruction of the outflow tract.  Decellularized aortic homografts (DAH)  Decellularized aortic homografts (DAH) for aortic valve replacement and decellularized pulmonary valves (DPH) for pulmonary valve replacement have been developed by several groups and companies over the last decade. DPH have been clinically implanted since 2002 in paediatric patients and have shown excellent early to midterm clinical performance, challenging conventional cryopreserved homografts as the \\"gold standard\\" for pulmonary valve replacement in congenital heart disease.Cebotari S, Tudorache I, Ciubotaru A, Boethig D, Sarikouch S, Goerler A, Lichtenberg A, Cheptanaru E, Barnaciuc S, Cazacu A, Maliga O, Repin O, Maniuc L, Breymann T, Haverich A.

Haemodynamic performance in terms of effective orifice area of DAH was outstanding compared to all other options and no calcification of the DAH has been observed to date.

As a naval militia, the Minnesota Naval Militia served as a Navy and Marine Corps parallel to the National Guard, where, like the soldiers of the Army National Guard and the airmen of the Air National Guard, sailors and marines could serve in a dual federal and state role as state military forces answerable to the governor, unless federalized and deployed by the federal government. The naval militia served as an active component of the organized militia from 1903 until the end of World War II. History =Creation= The Minnesota Naval Militia was first authorized by the Minnesota Legislature, when in 1899, they authorized a state naval reserve open to veterans of the United States Navy who had completed at least one tour of duty. In 1903, after obtaining permission from the State Department and the War Department, two divisions were organized. In 1905, the legislature officially changed the designation of the naval reserve to the Minnesota Naval Militia, bringing it in line with federal legislation that offered support to state naval militias. In 1906, the Minnesota Naval Militia received the USS Gopher for training purposes. The same year, a boathouse and pier were built near the yacht basin on the harbor side of Park Point to serve as a meeting place for the naval militia. In 1911, the naval militia used the USS Gopher to bring firefighters and supplies to fight a forest fire near Grand Marais, Minnesota. In 1915, a new 65-room National Guard armory was opened in Duluth to be used jointly by the Minnesota Army National Guard and the Minnesota Naval Militia. =World War I= During World War I, The Minnesota Naval Militia trained men and maintained chapters in Bemidji, Crosby, Duluth, and Pine City. The naval militia, under its commander, Captain Guy A. Eaton, traveled to Philadelphia where its sailors were integrated into the United States Navy command structure and deployed. =Inter-war period= Following the war, the Minnesota Naval Militia was reorganized with new units being created, with new members being members of the Minnesota Naval Militia as well as the United States Navy Reserve. In 1921, the USS Gopher was placed back under United States Navy control and sent to the Atlantic coast. In 1922, the gunboat cruiser U.S.S. Paducah was assigned to Duluth and used as a training ship, where it remained in service until 1940. In 1927, the U.S.S. Essex was brought to Duluth and used as a receiving ship until 1930. In 1932, members received updated training and were reorganized under the command of United States Navy officers. Before the onset of World War II, an aviation unit was added to the naval militia. =World War II= On December 3, 1940, the naval reservists in Duluth were activated. They disembarked from the Port of Duluth and landed in New York, where they were assigned to various U.S. Naval units that later served during World War II. Seaman First Class Alan Sanford, a member of the Minnesota Naval Militia, fired the first American shot of World War II when he fired at a Japanese midget submarine from his post on the USS Ward. Following the end of the war, the Minnesota Naval Militia was not reactivated. There were two ships named after Minnesota cities. Personnel Naval militias are partially regulated and equipped by the federal government, and membership requirements are set according to federal standards. Under 10 U.S. Code § 7854, in order to be eligible for access to \\"vessels, material, armament, equipment, and other facilities of the Navy and the Marine Corps available to the Navy Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve\\", at least 95% of members of the naval militia must also be members of the United States Navy Reserve or the United States Marine Corps Reserve. Legal status The naval militia is recognized as a component of the organized militia of the United States under 10 U.S. Code §7851. Article 5, Section 3 of the Minnesota Constitution recognizes the Governor of Minnesota as the commander-in-chief of the naval forces of the state. Responsibility therefore for the reactivation of the naval militia of the state falls on the Governor's office through executive action.

It is the second highest point of the Swabian-Franconian Forest, a natural region and forested hill range in the northeast of the state. In former times the Hagberg (as e. g. the Asperg and the Hesselberg) formed part of the border between the Swabians and Franks.  Location  The Hagberg lies 2.4 km (as the crow flies) west of the municipality of Gschwend in the Welzheim Forest.  Observation tower  The Hagberg Tower (Hagbergturm) is a 23-metre-high observation tower on the Hagberg that is constructed of wood on a reinforced concrete pedestal. It is crowned by two pagoda-like structures and is visible for miles around. A first tower was erected on the hill in 1901, but even before the First World War it had been replaced by the tower in its present form. In 1936 it was acquired by the Schwäbischer Albverein, which still maintains it today. During the Second World War the Luftwaffe established an observation post in the tower.Walter Hees: Die Amerikaner kommen … Kriegszeit und Kriegsende in Gschwend und auf der Frickenhofer Höhe. Hennecke, Remshalden-Buoch, 2006, . At that time the upper pagoda was removed. In 1949 the tower was renovated, in 1973 it had to be closed, however, due to its state of disrepair. In 1979/80 it was rebuilt in its original shape and opened again on 21 June 1980. From the two observation platforms there are views in good weather as far as Stuttgart, Heilbronn, Crailsheim and Aalen. From Easter to the end of October the Hagberg Tower is open on Sundays and holidays. On other days it may be opened on request to Gschwend Branch of the Jura Club. 500 metres away is a car park.

It involved a force of the German 2nd Army attacking elements of the VII Corps, which included British and Australian troops, and resulted in a complete defeat of the German assault. The Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions had been sent south from Belgium to help stem the tide of the German Spring Offensive towards Amiens and, with the British 35th Division, they held a line west and north of the Ancre river and the area between the Ancre and Somme, forming the southern flank of the Third Army. Much of the VII Corps front line consisted of a series of posts strung out along a railway embankment between Albert and Buire-sur-l'Ancre. The main German assault force was the 50th Reserve Division of the XXIII Reserve Corps, which concentrated its assault on the line between Albert and Dernancourt, attacking off the line of march after a short artillery preparation. Supporting attacks were to be launched by the 13th Division further west. Some German commanders considered success unlikely unless the embankment was weakly held, and the commander of the German 2nd Army ordered the attack to be postponed, but that message did not reach the assaulting troops in time. The Germans attacked at dawn under the cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a company in the early morning that was quickly repelled, partly due to the actions of Sergeant Stanley McDougall of the Australian 47th Battalion, the Germans failed to break through the VII Corps defences. McDougall was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry in the face of the enemy. By late afternoon, rain set in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. The Germans suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, and the Australians lost at least 137 killed or wounded. The British 35th Division suffered 1,540 casualties from 25 to 30 March. In the week following the battle, the Germans renewed their attempts to advance in the sector, culminating in the Second Battle of Dernancourt on 5April, when the Germans were defeated in desperate fighting. Background After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front fell into its usual lull over the winter months. In early 1918, it became apparent to the Allies that a large German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard just north of the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Third and Fifth Armies, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a series of staggering blows, a breach between the two British armies developed, and they were forced into a rapid, and in parts disorganised withdrawal, suffering heavy losses. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened. Shortly after the Spring Offensive began, the Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions were deployed south in stages from rest areas in the Flanders region of Belgium to the Somme river valley in France to help stem the German offensive. Initially it was intended to use them to launch a counter-offensive, but this idea was soon shelved due to German successes. On their way south, the 4th Brigade was detached from the 4th Division to help halt the Germans near Hébuterne in the centre of the Third Army sector. Travelling by train, bus and marching on foot, the remaining two brigades of the 4th Division, the 12th and 13th Brigades, concentrated in the area west of Dernancourt, under the command of the VII Corps led by Lieutenant General Walter Norris Congreve, which now formed the right flank of the Third Army. The commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, was ordered to support and then relieve remnants of the 9th (Scottish) Division, which was holding the front line along a railway between Albert and Dernancourt, west of the Ancre river. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General John Gellibrand. The 13th Brigade was held in support positions between Bresle and Ribemont-sur-Ancre. To the right of the 12th Brigade was the British 35th Division, positioned between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre, and commanded by Brigadier General Arthur Marindin. That division had been involved in a series of fighting withdrawals since being committed to battle on 25 March near Cléry-sur-Somme, some east of Dernancourt. The 3rd Division, commanded by Major General John Monash, was deployed further to the south, between the Ancre and the Somme around Morlancourt, with its 10th Brigade to the right of the 35th Division. Preparations =VII Corps dispositions= alt=a black and white sketch map From before midnight on 27 March, the now tired 12th Brigade had been holding the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having relieved the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. Northwest of Dernancourt, a mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as the outskirts of the village were very close to the railway line at this point, and provided good concealment for approaching enemy troops. If the line there was overrun, the enemy would be able to fire into the rear of the troops deployed along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire. On the left of the brigade front, with its northern flank short of the Albert–Amiens road, was the 48th Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Leane. To its left was the British 12th (Eastern) Division of V Corps. The 48th Battalion was holding its sector with two companies in a series of posts along alternate cuttings and embankments of the railway line as it ran south from Albert. Close to that town the railway line was not in VII Corps hands, and the posts were thrown back along the side of a gully short of the Albert–Amiens road, in contact with the southern posts of the 12th (Eastern) Division, which extended south of the road at this point. The battalion frontage was about . The 48th Battalion support line was located about to the rear on the high ground, astride the Albert–Amiens road. Due to the curvature of the slope, the two companies in the support line were out of sight of its forward companies at the railway line. On the right of the 48th Battalion was the 47th Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Imlay, with its two forward companies also strung out along the railway line. The total frontage of the 47th Battalion was , which meant that the 180–200 men of the forward companies were positioned in widely spaced posts. Between the forward companies was a section of embankment near a level crossing which was not garrisoned, but was covered from a shallow cutting to the south and a low embankment to the north. The 47th Battalion's support line was also located on the hill some distance to the rear. The 12th Machine Gun Company was deployed with eight of its Vickers machine guns in each battalion area, mainly sited along the railway line. Leane and Imlay had their headquarters co-located on the summit next to the Albert–Amiens road. Of the two remaining battalions of the 12th Brigade, the 45th Battalion was deployed on the slope behind the 106th Brigade of the 35th Division, and the 46th Battalion was held in reserve near the village of Millencourt. On the right of the 12th Brigade were elements of the 35th Division, the first of these was the 19th (Service) Battalion (2nd Tyneside Pioneers) of the Northumberland Fusiliers (19th NF), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.P.S.Foord. It was deployed near the railway arch on the northwestern outskirts of Dernancourt. The right-hand gun of the 12th Machine Gun Company was positioned with this unit, which was under the control of the 106th Brigade. To their right the 106th Brigade was deployed along the railway line as far as Buire-sur-l'Ancre, the front line there being held by the 17th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots, and the 12th (Service) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry. This section of the railway ran along flat ground. On its right, the 104th Brigade line ran from Buire-sur-l'Ancre past Treux, its forward battalions being the 18th (Service) Battalion (2nd South East Lancashire) of the Lancashire Fusiliers, and the 19th (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry. The 104th Brigade overlapped and sheltered the left flank of the 10th Brigade of the 3rd Division, which was deployed just east of Méricourt-l'Abbé. The VII Corps positions had excellent observation of the surrounding countryside, but were tactically weak. A significant amount of artillery support was available to the defenders. The divisional artillery of the 4th Division, consisting of the 10th and 11th Australian Field Artillery (AFA) Brigades, were within range, as were the British 50th and 65th Royal Field Artillery (RFA) Brigades. The S.O.S. lines of the 10th AFA Brigade were on a copse south of Albert, ahead of the 48th Battalion and those of the 11th AFA Brigade were on the far side of Dernancourt. The Australian batteries were in the open, as pits had not yet been dug for them due to their recent arrival. =German plan of attack= alt=a black and white sketch map The main German attack was to be made by the 50th Reserve Division of General der Infanterie Hugo von Kathen's XXIII Reserve Corps. The 50th Reserve Division was a Prussian division that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the British at Albert and Dernancourt and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the 9th Reserve Division north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 19th NF. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III Battalion, 230 RIR (III/230 RIR) would assault the embankment. After the capture of the embankment, the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II Battalion, 230 RIR (II/230 RIR) was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could succeed only if the embankment was weakly held and made representations to their brigade commander, to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes. Further west, supporting attacks were to be launched by the 13th Division, with the 15th Infantry Regiment (IR) assaulting across the Ancre towards the front line held by the 106th Brigade between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre and then exploiting success by driving west towards the village of Ribemont-sur-Ancre. The 13th IR was to attack the 104th Brigade at Marrett Wood. The German artillery preparation was to start at 05:15 on 28 March, and the assault to begin at 06:00. During the night of 27/28 March, the commander of the German 2nd Army apparently came to the same conclusion as the regimental commanders of the 50th Reserve Division, as at 03:00 he ordered the attack to be delayed until noon, and later further postponed it, but the orders did not reach the divisions in time. Battle alt=a black and white portrait of a male in uniform During the night of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had observed German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, heard the sound of bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running along the top of the embankment, saw German troops of II Battalion, 229 RIR (II/229 RIR) advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the unmanned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two-man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First, he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He turned the gun on them, and as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded. Other members of the 47th Battalion had garrisoned the northern end of the previously unoccupied bank, but the southern half remained open. A group of about 50 Germans of the 6th Company of II/229 RIR, advancing earlier than planned, had overrun the Lewis gun team covering the level crossing, and began advancing southwards behind the embankment to the rear of the right forward company of the battalion. Seeing their movement, McDougall and others opened fire on them. The barrel casing of McDougall's Lewis gun had grown so hot that his left hand became blistered, but he continued to fire it with the help of another sergeant. Of the party of Germans who had penetrated about beyond the railway line, two officers and 20 men had already been killed. Australian troops converged on the remaining Germans, and they quickly surrendered. A total of one officer and 29 men were captured. For his actions that morning, McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry in the face of the enemy. alt=a black and white aerial photograph with markings showing key features By this time, the rest of the front line between Albert to beyond Dernancourt was also being heavily attacked. In the north, forward troops of the 48th Battalion were firing almost continuously from the railway line. Attacked by elements of III Battalion, 229 RIR (III/229 RIR) supported by minenwerfers firing from a copse south of Albert, the 48th Battalion easily beat off every German assault. This was despite being caught in enfilade by a machine gun sited on the bridge where the Albert–Amiens road crossed the railway line. Leane directed artillery onto the wood south of Albert from which the minenwerfers were firing. This was the same wood upon which the S.O.S. line of the 10th AFA Brigade had been laid. Just as the Germans were assembling for a renewed assault, a stray British shell exploded a munitions dump, scattering panicked troops of II/229 RIR, many of whom were then shot down by the Australians. The 48th lost only three officers and 59 men during the day's fighting. Wary of sending reinforcements from his support line down the exposed slope to the railway line, Leane sent only four men with two Lewis guns forward during the daylight hours. During the day, the right of the 48th was steadily extended to allow the 47th Battalion to move right in turn. The 47th Battalion's sector was also being heavily attacked by II/229 RIR, and apart from the initial penetration by the 6th Company, they also held the German assault, with assistance from the Lewis guns of the 48th Battalion on their left, who caught the advancing Germans in enfilade. On one occasion a party of the left forward company of the battalion charged over the embankment, chasing the Germans back across the flats into some buildings, and then forcing them out of that cover. Exposed to heavy fire, this small force withdrew back to the railway embankment by noon. When he received reports of the German assault, Imlay sent two platoons of his right support company forward to reinforce the right flank of the battalion front line. However, the exposed slope between the two positions was swept by German machine gun fire and shell fire, and the men could be sent forward only in rushes, well spread out, so this took some time and they suffered casualties. Soon after their arrival, the right forward company inflicted heavy casualties on another German attempt to rush the embankment. Imlay later sent another platoon to reinforce the left flank, and a carrying party with a resupply of hand grenades. In the meantime, Gellibrand placed the 45th Battalion at Imlay's disposal, although they did not immediately move forward from their position behind the 106th Brigade. German engineers attempted to place pontoon bridges across the Ancre north of Dernancourt to allow assembling troops to cross, but the pontoons were soon riddled and many engineers killed and wounded by guns of the 12th Machine Gun Company. When Imlay became aware of this concentration of German troops, he ordered a company of the 45th Battalion to move to his support lines. During the day, the 47th Battalion suffered 75 casualties. alt=a black and white photograph of a railway bridge on an embankment The German artillery bombardment was heaviest in the sector held by the right company of the 47th Battalion and the 19th NF on either side of the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. About 05:00, I/230 RIR began advancing down the slope from the line of the Morlancourt–Méaulte road in three waves, and was quickly met by Lewis gun fire from the 19th NF, which broke up the movement. The German battalion had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It continued to advance through the Australian and British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 19th NF, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the 19th NF in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of the 18th (Service) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous Australian and British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down. About 10:00, a German force estimated at around two battalions in strength emerged from the village and lined out about from the embankment among the hedgerows and gardens at the edge of the village. At the same time, a German barrage fell heavily about 200 yards behind the defending troops along the railway line. As ammunition was running low, resupply parties were sent forward from the support line, and the dead and wounded were stripped of what ammunition they had left. This renewed German pressure was focussed mainly on the left forward company of the 19th NF that held the railway bridge, which managed to push a Lewis gun team forward of the embankment to enfilade the assembling Germans. The German barrage increased about 10:25, and casualties mounted among the 19th NF. One of these was Foord, who was wounded in the neck but remained at his post. From the attack near the railway bridge it became clear that Dernancourt was in German hands, despite a previous assumption that it was still held by patrols of the 35th Division. After the heavy shelling of the village, reports were received that the Germans were withdrawing. About 12:30, the commander of the 106th Brigade requested that the artillery fire on the village stop at 14:00 so he could send patrols into the village in an attempt to secure it. He was unable to mount a proper attack due to losses. He asked Gellibrand to extend the right flank of his line to include the railway bridge to free up his troops to go forward. Imlay was ordered to do this, and to follow up any success the 19th NF achieved, but according to the author of a 47th Battalion history, Craig Deayton, this push into Dernancourt had a \\"ridiculously optimistic\\" objective, as the German strength in the village was obvious from the attacks that had been mounted from it. Imlay also directed the attached company of the 45th to move down to that sector from his support line as soon as the 19th NF went forward. In the event, the pioneers launched an attack by the remnants of two companies, totalling about 100 men. According to Deayton, once they left the cover of the embankment, they came under heavy machine gun fire from the village, suffered significant casualties and withdrew to their start line. A different version is provided by Davson, the historian of the 35th Division, who states that the 19th NF attack achieved success that was \\"immediate and remarkable\\", driving the Germans back into the village leaving many machine guns behind. The 47th did not follow up the pioneers in going forward towards Dernancourt. The move of the company of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, possibly as the company commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire; 11 men being killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on who was responsible for this debacle, in his notebooks, the official historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay. About 18:00, Gellibrand optimistically ordered the 47th to push into Dernancourt, but they met massed machine gun fire from the village as soon as they began and quickly retired to the railway line. Deayton describes the two attacks on the village as \\"ill conceived\\" and the losses incurred unnecessary, as it was obvious to the troops on the railway line that the village was strongly held by the Germans. alt=a black and white photograph of positions dug into the side of a sunken road, with soldiers resting The far left flank of the German attack fell on the 104th Brigade near the village of Treux, although with the line south of the Ancre in this area, the defenders were less subject to surprise and had good fields of fire. A post of the 18th (Service) Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers was located in a deep sunken road in the northeast corner of Marrett Wood, which was southwest of Treux itself. On the evening of 27 March, Monash had ordered the 10th Brigade to establish if the 35th Division really held the wood, and patrols of the 37th Battalion had located the British post in the sunken road and provided some support, consisting of a few snipers and a Lewis gun crew which was low on ammunition. About 06:00, a small German attack was launched in this sector, but it was repelled with Lewis gun fire. About 08:00, Germans were seen approaching in the distance, and the commander of the Lancashire Fusiliers post asked the 37th Battalion for greater support. Before this could arrive, several hundred Germans of II/13 IR attacked, but they were beaten off by the combined British-Australian force at Marrett Wood with the help of the British artillery. The rest of 13 IR attacked further east around the village of Ville, but were easily stopped by the main line of the 106th Brigade. In response to the Lancashire Fusiliers' request for reinforcements, a company of the 38th Battalion occupied Marrett Wood about 11:35, just as another unsuccessful German assault was mounted. A further unsuccessful attempt was made at 16:30. The Germans blamed lack of adequate artillery support for their failure to capture Treux and Marrett Wood. Throughout the day, the Australian and British artillery fired on German assembly areas east and south of the railway line. About 16:00, warning was received of a possible German attack north of the Albert–Amiens road, so Gellibrand advised the 46th Battalion, then in reserve, that they might be needed to combine with a company of Medium Mark A Whippet tanks to help repel the forecast attack. About this time, a light drizzle began to fall, and the attack never came. Half an hour after this warning, Germans of III/230 RIR supported by elements of I and II/230 RIR, were seen filtering into houses on the southern outskirts of Albert in the 48th Battalion sector. Artillery was directed into this area, which drove the Germans out again. By 17:00, German troops could be seen withdrawing east in the distance. By this time, the troops of the 12th Brigade had been \\"moving, marching and fighting for three days and three nights almost without sleep\\", and were in a state of exhaustion. Increasing rain into the evening made renewal of the German effort less likely. In all, nine attacks were mounted by the Germans on the railway line during the day, and all but the brief penetration into the 47th Battalion sector were beaten off, although the defending troops had suffered significant casualties in doing so. According to Deayton, the defensive deficiencies of the forward positions along the railway line were obvious. Aftermath =Subsequent operations= The attacks of 28 March were a continuation of the rapid advances that had caused the withdrawal of the hard-pressed Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to the fact that this was not a set-piece assault but merely an attack off the line of march with minimal preparation. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, and 230 RIR had lost another 240. Despite the withdrawal of the 50th and 65th RFA Brigades on 29 March, the Australian artillery continued to batter Dernancourt, causing another 83 casualties to 230 RIR who were garrisoning the village. The German attempt to renew their advance between Albert and Buire-sur-l'Ancre on 28 March had been completely defeated. Australian casualties amounted to at least 137 killed or wounded, and from 25 to 30 March, the 35th Division suffered 1,540 casualties. The battalions of the 12th and 13th Brigades were awarded the battle honour \\"Somme 1918\\" in part for their participation in the battle. The Germans made two more minor and unsuccessful assaults on the railway embankment south of Albert on 1and 3April. They then renewed their offensive in this sector with a determined push on 5April that was halted by the 4th Division after desperate fighting during the Second Battle of Dernancourt. Elsewhere, the Australian 3rd Division fought a sharp action during the First Battle of Morlancourt over the period 28–30 March, followed by heavy fighting further south around Villers-Bretonneux in early April.

Life  Alexis Peter Vlasto was born at Toxteth Park, at that time a prosperous quarter in Liverpool, a major port city in northwest England. He was the younger of the two recorded children (and the only son) of Peter Theodore Vlasto (1879–1941) by his marriage to Aziza Katherine Pallis. The Liverpool-based Vlastos at this time are described as a \\"family of Greek shipping agents\\". Vlasto attended Eton College, a prestigious English \\"public school\\" where he enjoyed the status of a \\"King's Scholar\\", before progressing in 1937 to King's College, Cambridge where he studied modern and medieval languages. As the veil of secrecy lifted it became known that in 1939 Vlasto was one of those headhunted to work at the British code breaking establishment at Bletchley in central England. Given charge of the Japanese Army Air Force section, tasks included cracking the Japanese Army Air Force code system 3366. Others assigned to the challenge included Maurice Wiles and Mervyn Jones. Someone else with whom he renewed an acquaintance at Bletchley Park was the young musicologist, Hilda Joan \\"Jill\\" Medway, like him seconded from Cambridge University to undertake \\"war work\\". War ended in May 1945: Vlasto and Medway had already married, on 19 March 1945. By the end of 1945 they were back in Cambridge where Jill Vlasto resumed her teaching role, directing studies in music at both the \\"recognised institutions for the higher education for women\\" (after 1948 women's colleges). Alexis accepted a research fellowship at his old college and pursued his studies, working towards a doctorate. Their home was large enough to accommodate a lodger. The harpsichordist Thurston Dart, like Jill Vlasto a pioneer champion of the \\"early music revival\\", lodged with the Vlastos on the western fringes of the city during 1949/50. By this time the focus of Vlasto's own academic work was on Slavonic Studies, a topic which the political concerns of the time had pushed up the national and academic agendas. Alexis Vlasto was one of those who participated, as part of a small but eminent group of scholars gathered together by the remarkable Elizabeth Hill, in the establishment of the Cambridge University Department of Slavonic Studies which opened in 1948. Vlasto finally received his PhD in 1953. He taught in the Department of Slavonic Studies at Cambridge from 1954 until his retirement in 1983. 1968 was a defining year in two contrasting respects. His book \\"The Entry of the Slavs into Christendom\\" was published. Its contribution to scholarship has stood the test of time. 1968 was also the year in which, on 15 September, Jill Vlasto died, aged just 52. In 1969 Alexis Vlasto was elected a fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. The Master of the college was Owen Chadwick, who would later remember Vlasto as \\"a man who combined the ability to be infuriatingly impractical at times with a warm and generous heart in friendship\\". Retirement was gradual rather than sudden. Vlasto's other major work, \\"The Linguistic History of Russia\\", appeared in 1986 and continues to earn plaudits. In his final decades he was also able to devote more time to his principal long standing extra-curricular enthusiasms: music and botany. He had a deep knowledge of both subjects. In 1968 he collected seeds from a Silene viscariopsis, an unusual plant he had found in what was then Yugoslavia, and donated them to the University Botanic Garden. Plants grown from these seeds were distributed to botanical institutions around the world and opened the way to at least one significant research project.

He stood for mayor of New York in 1909 but lost. He died at sea while on a cruise to the Philippines. Early life Otto Tremont Bannard was born on April 28, 1854 in Brooklyn, New York. He was the youngest of five children born to John Winslow Bannard (1822–1911) and his wife Eliza Landon Stone (1821–1903). Among his siblings were Henry Clay Bannard, Hubbard Francis Bannard, Walter Clifton Bannard, and Estella Stone Bannard. His father had emigrated with his parents from Oxfordshire, England and settled in Schenectady, New York. He became a successful New York wholesaler of \\"narrow fabrics\\" (i.e., lace, ribbon, and embroidery), but suffered severe financial hardship as a result of the Panic of 1857. He relocated with his family to Quincy, Illinois, on the Mississippi River, at that time a significant market town and transportation hub. John purchased a small flour mill there, but ten years later the mill burned, leaving the family nearly penniless. Otto's mother began writing poems, essays, and short stories under the pen name \\"Lizzie\\" to supplement the family's income. Otto studied in the preparatory department of Beloit College before attending Yale University, where he was a member of the senior society Skull and Bones, and from which he was graduated with a B.A. in 1876. He was granted an LL.B. degree from Columbia Law School in 1878. Career Bannard campaign button Bannard entered the banking profession, becoming the president of the Continental Trust Company in 1893. In 1904, Continental Trust merged with the New York Security and Trust Company and Bannard became president of the new firm, which took the name of the New York Trust Company in 1905. Charles S. Fairchild, the president of New York Security and Trust (who formerly was the Attorney General of New York and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury) became chairman of New York Trust. Bannard was elected president of the corporation. Bannard served as president until 1915 when he was succeeded by Mortimer N. Buckner (later president of the New York Clearing House). Via a series of mergers, it ultimately became Chemical Bank. He ran, as a candidate for the mayor of New York City in 1909, in a three-man election that was won by William J. Gaynor. Bannard came in second, with William Randolph Hearst coming in third. =Philanthropy= In 1927 he was national chairman of a campaign that raised $21,000,000 for the endowment of Yale University. He served as a member of the Yale Corporation for eighteen years. Personal life Bannard, who never married, died on January 15, 1929 at sea on the SS President Cleveland en route from Seattle to Manila in the Philippines, a journey he was making for the sake of his health. He is buried in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut. His will left a bequest of about $2,000,000 to Yale University, in addition to the numerous gifts he had made during his lifetime.

He is well known for his painted outer coffin (commonly called “Bersha coffin”) now exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston along with his other grave goods. Biography Once believed to have lived during the reign of pharaoh Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty, from the analysis of his furniture it has been deducted that he actually lived in an earlier period, although a degree of uncertainty still remains: it's very difficult to trace Djehutynakht's family and life events, and the only certain relationship it that with his wife, also named Djehutynakht. The name was very common in this period and six nomarchs bearing it are known, two of whom – the fourth and the fifth respectively – were married to a wife with the same name. pp. 70-2 If this nomarch was the same of Djehutynakht IV, then he lived at the very end of the 11th Dynasty and was the son of the nomarch Ahanakht I, successor of his brother Ahanakht II, and predecessor of the nomarch Neheri I. Otherwise, if he was the same of Djehutynakht V, then he lived during the late reign of pharaoh Amenemhat I of the 12th Dynasty and was Neheri I's son and successor by his wife Djehutyhotep, and the uncle of his successor Neheri II. In either cases, no children are known for Djehutynakht and his wife. See \\"Nomarchs of the Hare nome\\" for a complete genealogy. Tomb 10A Djehutynakht's tomb – designated 10A – was rediscovered in the Deir el-Bersha necropolis in Middle Egypt in 1915 by the American Egyptologist George Andrew Reisner who was the leader of the Harvard University – Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition. Almost nothing was left of the outer chapel but the burial chamber, although already raided of the jewelry, still contained several finely painted cedar wooden coffins belonged to Djehutynakht and his wife (above all his outer coffin, commonly called “Bersha coffin”, renowned as “the finest painted coffin Egypt produced and a masterpiece of panel painting”. Along with the coffins, in the tomb were found the nomarch's mummified head as well as lady Djehutynakht's canopic chest and a great number of funerary furniture such as pottery, canopic jars, several model boats, many models of men and women in different daily life activities, and the famous group composed of a priest and many offering girls, known as “Bersha procession”. In its entirety, these objects forms the largest Middle Kingdom funerary assemblage ever found. The Egyptian government gave the whole content of Tomb 10A to the Museum of Fine Arts. During the naval trip to Boston in 1920, the collection was threatened by a fire on board, but fortunately the damage was very limited. For decades only the “Bersha coffin” and the “Bersha procession” were exhibited at the MFA; in 2009-10 the whole collection was shown in a dedicated exhibition.

She was born and died in Germany. Some of her most productive and (especially for English-language readers) best documented years were spent in England, where she also achieved some notability as a feminist campaigner. Life Marguerite Steinfeld was born in 1904 Bischheim, a small town just to the north of Strasbourg, and at that time part of the German empire. When she was 14, the entire region was transferred to France following Germany's defeat in World War I. Steinfeld trained initially to work as a teacher. By 1920 she was studying at the Brookings School in Washington DC, where an early influence was the eminent statistician Ethelbert Stewart. While there, she got to know fellow German Jürgen Kuczynski, who was doing post-graduate work. They subsequently worked together and on 18 September 1928 they were married. In 1927 Steinfeld had taken a position as a research assistant at the recently established National Bureau of Economic Research, in New York City. In the summer of 1929, the young couple returned to Europe and settled in Berlin. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi party) took power and lost little time in setting up a one-party state in Germany. Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi Party) became illegal, and the ban on political parties was enforced with particular effect in respect of (former) Communist Party members. During the next few years, the Nazi party increasingly expressed the strident anti- Semitism which had been featured in Nazi rhetoric during that party's years in opposition. During 1933 the Nazis arrested and imprisoned many German communists; others left the country to avoid the same fate. Sources indicate that as early as February/March 1933, the Kuczynskis discussed following other family members into emigration, but at this point they decided to stay in Germany and participate in anti-fascist resistance. Eventually, in January 1936, emigration could be put off no longer, however, and the couple moved to England. In England the two of them continued their work as left-wing economists while also engaging in anti-Fascist work, some of it legal: some not. Marguerite published a number of articles on the labour market, wages and the position of workers, sometimes in collaboration with her husband. She also participated in anti-fascist immigrant organisations and, later in the decade, established a library for the English branch of the Free German League of Culture (Freier Deutscher Kulturbund). She directed the library until the couple returned to Berlin in 1946. Up until 1942, she worked as secretary to the War Committee of German Woman Refugees (Kriegshilfskomitees deutscher Flüchtlingsfrauen). In 1943 she was elected to the executive committee of the Women's Co-operative Guild. She gave lectures on the theme of Women's Resistance in Nazi Germany, and contributed an essay to a compilation- publication entitled \\"Women under the Swastika\\". She also organised numerous support actions and assisted with the visa applications of German refugees persecuted for reasons of politics or race. War ended in May 1945, with Berlin now at the heart of the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Several months after her husband, Marguerite Kuczynski returned to Berlin in March 1947; the couple at first lived in the same house they had inhabited before the war. It was now considered within the city's US occupation zone. Kuczynski took a position with the city administration and then, as the de facto political division of the city began to appear more permanent, and a few years later to be reflected in physical frontier-divisions, she took work with the Finance Ministry in the Soviet zone. Later, the Soviet-administered occupation zone was reorganized and declared in October 1949, as the Soviet- sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). At that time, Kuczynski began working for the East German Ministry for Overseas Trade (\\"Außenwirtschaftsministerium\\"). She gave up government work, however, contending that work there was \\"too amateurish\\" (\\"zu dilettantisch\\"). In any event, the real focus of power in East Germany, modeled on constitutional arrangements of the Soviet Union, was not with government ministries but with the Central Committee of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). From 1957 Kuczynski worked as an academic researcher with the Central Committee's Institute for Marxism–Leninism. In 1960 she retired from the Institute as well, finding it \\"too dogmatic\\". In the meantime, her outstanding achievements as a researcher with the Institute for Marxism–Leninism included a new edition of Karls Marx's early work, The Poverty of Philosophy, included in Volume 4 of the 43 volume \\"Marx-Engels-Werke\\" series produced by the East German Party Central Committee between 1956 and 1990. Her contribution to the new edition of The Poverty of Philosophy was much enhanced by her use of an early French language edition, discovered following intensive research in Japan, in which Marx himself had penned extensive margin notes. Some of Marguerite Kuczynski's most enduring contributions to scholarship, produced only after her \\"retirement\\" in 1960, were a series of translations into German, supported by her own extensive and scholarly commentaries, of works by François Quesnay (Physiocrat). Later, during the 1980s, she made a start on a similar set of translations of the work of economist-statesman Turgot, but this project remained unfinished because her eye-sight failed. Personal The Kuczynskis had three recorded children: Madeleine (1932), Peter (1937) and Thomas (1944). Of these, Thomas Kuczynski subsequently became notable as an economist and statistician, known in particular for his work on damages claims of victims of German wartime Forced labour policies. Rita Kuczynski, known in German-speaking lands as a writer-philosopher (and more recently as a novelist), is a daughter-in-law of Marguerite Kuczynski. Marguerite Kuczynski died in Berlin in January 1998, slightly more than five months after the death of her husband. That year Thomas Kuczynski and his wife Rita divorced, following some years of separation.

He was also founding principal of the Far Eastern Bible College. Personal life Tow was educated at the Anglo-Chinese School. He was influenced first by John Sung, and later by Carl McIntire. He studied at Faith Theological Seminary and was ordained in Geneva in 1950 at a special meeting of the Philadelphia Presbytery of the Bible Presbyterian Church. Tow returned to Singapore and became pastor of the Life Church English Service at Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church. In 1955, he led a group out of the Chinese Presbyterian Synod to form the Bible- Presbyterian Church. Tow's congregation became known as Life Bible- Presbyterian Church (Life BPC). He later returned to Faith Theological Seminary and completed a Master of Sacred Theology degree. In 2003, Tow resigned from Life BPC and founded True Life Bible-Presbyterian Church. He had been criticized for holding to the doctrine of Verbal Plenary Preservation (VPP) and, together with the other directors of the Far Eastern Bible College (FEBC), was sued in 2008 by Life BPC for teaching this doctrine in the Church's attempt to evict the College from the Gilstead Road premises which had been shared by the two institutions from the outset. However the Church failed as the Court of Appeal of Singapore, the apex court in the Singapore legal system, ruled on 26 April 2011 that (i)“the VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI doctrine which both parties [i.e., FEBC and Life BPC] adhere to,” (rejecting Life BPC’s contention in [59] of the Court of Appeal Judgement that it is “an entirely different creature from the VPI doctrine\\");” (ii) “the College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession;” (iii) “[i]t is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI [Verbal Plenary Inspiration] doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine;” and (iv) “[i]n the absence of anything in the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we [the Court] hesitate to find that the verbal plenary preservation doctrine is a deviation from the principles contained within the Westminster Confession.\\"See also Wikipedia's Khoo Jeffrey and others v Life Bible-Presbyterian Church and others.

Born Edith Brown in Clapham, she initially trained as a school teacher, before meeting Rev. John Jones, a clergyman from the Church of England. The two were married in London in 1904, and the couple embarked for Australia later that year, when John was appointed as head of the Anglican church mission on Thursday Island. Although returning to England briefly at one stage, by 1912 John was the general secretary of the Australian Board of Missions, based in Sydney. The couple moved again in the 1920s, this time to St Kilda in Melbourne, where Edith was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in the Victorian Children's Court. She also joined the Victorian Women Citizens' Movement and became its president, also standing for election for the federal seat of Fawkner in 1925, although she withdrew from the race prior to polling day. Jones' increasing activism and expertise in Indigenous matters was recognised in 1929, when she gave evidence to a royal commission on the status and conditions of Indigenous people in Australia. In her evidence, she argued for federal control of Indigenous affairs, and advocated for greater legal recognition of the rights of Indigenous women. She was exceptionally critical of the prevailing race policy of the time, noting that Indigenous people were being exploited as a result of \\"the stealing of their women and the supplying to them of intoxicants in order to facilitate these thefts\\", and testified that a matron at a mission near Alice Springs had alleged that \\"I cannot keep these little children in the compound, they are enticed out by the white men, and more half-castes are then being born\\". Returning to England with her husband in 1930, Jones continued to issue a series of papers that were critical of the treatment of Indigenous people in Australia. She formed a committee within the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society in 1932 to coordinate international campaigns to put pressure on the Australian government over the issue, and both she and her husband continued to agitate for reform to laws that discriminated against indigenous people in the areas of health, education, and citizenship. She died in 1952 in Kent.

She completed her training in Chicago before returning to Los Angeles in 1948, where she practiced for more than 50 years. Early life Shigekawa was born in 1913 in South Pasadena, California. Her father, Tsunetaro Shigekawa, worked as a gardener and a hog farmer, while her mother, Shina (Nagasaki) Shigekawa, was a picture bride; both had migrated to the United States from Shikoku. She and her twin sister, younger sister, and younger brother grew up in a house on Central Avenue in Los Angeles, in a neighborhood that housed numerous Japanese Americans. She was inspired to become a physician when her father was hospitalized for pneumonia. After graduating from Jefferson High School, she studied at University of Southern California (USC) and then the Stritch School of Medicine at Loyola University Chicago. She had wanted to complete her medical degree at USC, but when she applied in 1935 the university did not admit women to the medical program. She graduated from Loyola in 1940. Career Shigekawa completed her medical internship at Mercy Hospital in Bay City, Michigan, where she became the second female medical intern. She began her residency at Los Angeles County Hospital but all of the hospital's Japanese-American staff were dismissed in 1941 in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor. She then worked briefly at Seaside Memorial Hospital before being forced to move to the Santa Anita Assembly Center, a processing center for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, where she was one of seven imprisoned physicians of Japanese background who provided care for 17,000 fellow inmates. Shigekawa was the youngest of the doctors at 29 years old, and the only woman. When she was ordered to move to Wyoming to be interned and work at the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, another internment camp for Japanese Americans, she sent letters to the government saying that she refused to go and that if forced to move there she would not work. She was subsequently released to live in Chicago, where she finished her residency in obstetrics at Walter Memorial Hospital. She worked at a private practice with another woman physician until 1948, when she returned to Los Angeles. Shigekawa set up a medical practice on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood in 1949. In the same year, she began working at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles, where she was the first Japanese-American staff member, and in 1977 she became the first woman to be elected president of the hospital. She worked at her Hollywood practice for more than 50 years, and in 2000 she estimated that throughout her career she had delivered between 20,000 and 30,000 babies. In 1993, Shigekawa received Loyola University's Stritch Award \\"for outstanding research or humanitarian contributions in medicine\\". She served as president of Japanese Community Health Inc. and was a member of the Japanese American Medical Association. Death Shigekawa died in Los Angeles on October 18, 2013, aged 100.

Its plinth survived, and is now located near Hastings Gardens.Cassar, M. (2018, December 9). Every picture tells a story (1): Marsamxett in the 1850s. The Sunday Times of Malta, pp. 59.

While Ponsonby was in England in 1836, he resigned from the post of Governor, and died suddenly on 11 January of the following year. In 1838, a column was built in honour of the dead Governor on St. Andrew's Bastion, overlooking Marsamxett Harbour. Its architect is not known, but it could have been designed by Giorgio Pullicino. The monument consisted of a 70-foot-high Doric column on a plinth, surmounted by an urn. The main inscription read: In January 1864, the column was struck by lightning, and it was subsequently demolished. The plinth remained intact, but in November 1888 it was removed from St. Andrew's Bastion to make way for new gun emplacements on the bastion. The plinth was reassembled near Hastings Gardens on St. Michael's Bastion, and the following inscription was added: The plinth was damaged by shrapnel during aerial bombardment in World War II. It was restored a number of times over the years, most recently in 2013 under the sponsorship of the Bank of Valletta. The plinth is listed as a Grade 1 national monument by MEPA.

After a brief meeting with the Heroes for Hire, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, Tower dealt with the acquittal of Spider-Man against charges for the death of George Stacy and Norman Osborn. He also tried to help Spider-Man against the attacks of J. Jonah Jameson, Spencer Smythe and the Spider-Slayer. Subsequently Tower collected the deposition of Captain America regarding a case involving Batroc the Leaper.

He informs Inspector Priscilla Ridley about Mariah Dillard's negotiations with city officials to supply the NYPD's Emergency Service Unit with Judas bullets, a special kind of bullet designed by Diamondback for the purpose of killing Luke. Tower is greatly concerned about the move, fearing the damage the Judas bullets could do if they end up in the hands of criminals. He later reappears at the start of the season 2 finale during Mariah's arraignment, presenting the prosecution's case against Mariah in front of Judge Amanda Garmon. However, his efforts at prosecuting Mariah are rendered all for naught after Tilda poisons her in jail. * While Blake Tower doesn't appear in The Defenders, he is mentioned by Misty Knight's boss Captain Strieber when Matt, Luke, and Jessica are reluctant to share information about the Hand with them. * At the start of Season 3 of Daredevil, Tower is incensed when the FBI let Wilson Fisk out of prison as part of an informant deal. When Foggy tries to get him to pursue charges against Fisk, Tower refuses, which Foggy takes as a sign that Tower refuses to do anything against Fisk lest he compromise his chances of getting reelected. At Marci's suggestion, Foggy runs against Tower as a write-in candidate, and asks Brett Mahoney to introduce him to address a congregation of NYPD at a Police Union function. Foggy gains the endorsement of the NYPD for his write in campaign. Later, upon learning that Fisk is planning to make himself the sole source of government protection from prosecution for criminals in the city, Foggy decides to call Tower out on these allegations while Tower is speaking in a public forum. When Matt, Karen and Foggy are able to get Agent Ray Nadeem to speak out against Fisk, they arrange for him to make a plea bargain with Tower, though the attempt to use a grand jury deposition to stop Fisk ends up failing when Fisk threatens the grand jurors' lives. In the season 3 finale, he is among those who attend Father Lantom's funeral, and after the funeral, Foggy officially drops out of the race and endorses Tower's reelection campaign as he had promised earlier.

It was founded by the \\"Public Commission to Protect the Legacy of Andrei Sakharov\\", an international non-governmental organization established in 1990 through the efforts of Sakharov's widow Yelena Bonner and other Sakharov's friends and colleagues. History In 1994 the Public Commission opened the Sakharov Archives in the three-room apartment where Andrei Sakharov lived. The archives’ contents were donated by Yelena Bonner, and include files donated by Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service. In 1996 the Sakharov Commission opened the Sakharov Museum and multi-functional social center for Peace, Progress and Human Rights (renamed in 2012 as the Sakharov Center). The main building of the museum is a two-story manor that houses a library, and a permanent exhibition dedicated to the history of the dissident movement in the USSR, and to the life and works of Andrei Sakharov. The exhibition was designed by Evgeny Asse. An installation made from a piece of the Berlin Wall stands in the park belonging to the museum. Activities The Sakharov Center provides a space for open expression in an increasingly-restrictive political climate. In 2003, the Sakharov Center was vandalized after organizing a contemporary art exhibition titled “Caution, Religion!”. In 2013 Cossacks stormed the Sakharov Center and interrupted “Moscow Trials,” a play based on the trial of Pussy Riot directed by Milo Rau. In 2014 the Center was attacked by Orthodox fundamentalists during events advocating tolerance for the LGBT community. The memorial service for opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was also held in the Sakharov Center. On December 26, 2014 the Sakharov Center was declared a “foreign agent” under Russia's foreign agent law. This law has been criticized both in Russia and internationally as representing a violation of human rights and having been designed to counter opposition groups. In fact, the court cited the Sakharov Center's political activity as the main reason for designating it as a “foreign agent”. In January 2015, the Tagansky District Court fined the Sakharov Center 300,000 rubles for not voluntarily declaring itself a “foreign agent”. The Sakharov Center denies this designation and has appealed the decision. On September 30, 2015 the Sakharov Center was fined again for failing to label itself as a foreign agent in an article it posted online.

Description and history The Fowler House is located on the north side of School Street, between Church Street and Pike Lane in a residential area of central Lubec. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The south-facing facade is three bays wide, with pilasters at the corners and an entablature above. The entrance is in the left bay, flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. The main gable is fully pedimented, with a small triangular multi-pane window at its center. A c. 1900 Colonial Revival porch extends across the front and around to the side, supported by round columns. The interior of the house retains extensive period woodwork and other finishes, and has a particularly well-kept early 20th century bathroom with original fixtures. The house was built about 1840 by Jeremiah Fowler, during a period of Lubec's growth as an industrial and shipbuilding center. Fowler, a merchant, sold the house in the 1850s to Simon Ryerson, the owner of a general store who later started a shipbuilding firm. The house was next owned by Ryerson's business partner, A. B.

It was ported on to Microsoft Windows in April 2008. The game is loosely based on the comic book series of the same title and is unrelated to the story and setting of previous Turok video games. Players assume the role of Native American space marine Joseph Turok, who is part of a team sent to a remote planet to apprehend General Roland Kane, Turok's former commanding officer, who is now a wanted war criminal. After crash landing, Turok discovers that the planet is home to all manner of dinosaurs, and must fight both the predatory creatures and Kane's private army on his mission to take down his former mentor. Gameplay The gameplay of Turok is similar to that of most first-person shooters, with a strong focus on survival in dangerous natural environments. The human enemies, under the leadership of Kane, are the main threat to the player, although dinosaurs may often be found wandering throughout the game. The dinosaurs act as a neutral force and, if the player chooses, can be used as a tool to attack enemy soldiers. This may be done by attracting roaming dinosaurs to a firefight (via: flares, gunshots, etc.) to aid the player and help dispatch the enemy, with possible other ways depending on the situation. The dinosaurs' intelligence are much alike the Earth dinosaurs, so other dinosaurs and all humans, including the player's allies and enemies, may be attacked. The game does not utilize an aim-assist feature. The developer Propaganda Games has included an additional, stealth mechanic in the game. Because Turok takes place mostly in jungle environments with a focus on ambiance, the player may kill enemies with a bow or knife without being heard or use dinosaurs to attract the attention of other enemies and slip by unnoticed. A famed new feature into this game is the Silent Kill, which is done by drawing the knife, then attacking a human or unaware dinosaur from behind. The kill can be utilized against dinosaurs and humans alike as a finishing blow, and can be executed from any side. The knife is also utilized as a self-defense weapon during phases known as \\"mauls\\", where the player is attacked by a dinosaur or bug, and must hammer on the according buttons in order to counter-attack or fend off the attack. =Multiplayer= Online multiplayer support is also available. There is a (Team) Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Wargames, and Assault Capture the Flag. Multiplayer supports up to 16 people, and 4 players for three co-op missions. A feature in the multiplayer—randomly spawning computer-controlled dinosaurs and insects that appear in various locations in levels—adds a new factor to the gameplay. While players must worry about the opposing enemies, they must now also worry about the hostile dinosaurs that will be attempting to kill them. There can be up to 4 A.I controlled dinosaurs or insects on any map at one time. Unfortunately, splitscreen multiplayer is not supported in any form. Originally, the Xbox 360 version of Turok was set to feature an Achievement called \\"Grab Bag\\", which required players to kill at least one enemy, one dinosaur, one teammate, and themselves, all in the same match. This caused controversy on the Internet as the Achievement essentially rewarded players for team killing. Josh Holmes, a representative of Propaganda Games, described the creation of the Achievement by saying \\"What we found was that players playing their first match in Turok – almost every player – was (accidentally) killing himself, a team mate and an enemy with a grenade or a Stick [sic] Bomb gun and so we thought 'hey, we should give them an Achievement for that', as kind of a joke.\\" He went on to say that developers were planning to release a patch removing Grab Bag if excessive team killing became a problem after launch. In the launch version of the game, however, while the \\"Grab Bag\\" Achievement is still present, it removed the requirement of killing a teammate, and is awarded after the player kills an enemy, a dinosaur, and themselves in the same match. A Map pack called the \\"Velociraptor Pack\\" was later released, containing two new multiplayer maps, one new Co-op map, and 2 refurbished maps, which now take place at night. The online multiplayer for the PlayStation 3 version has been permanently shutdown since February 2011. Plot The player controls Corporal Joseph Turok (voiced by Gregory Cruz), former member of the Wolf Pack, a specialized military detachment whose members were trained in black ops by General Roland Kane (voiced by Powers Boothe). After a falling out with the group, Turok was reassigned to a general military unit known as Whiskey Company. The team has been assembled to apprehend his former mentor and return him to Earth. After committing various war crimes, Kane had disappeared three years earlier only to surface on a backwater world. Unbeknownst to Whiskey Company, the planet is under the jurisdiction of the Mendel-Grumman (M-G) Corporation, and Kane is in command of a private army of M-G soldiers and equipment. At first, the crew shuns Turok, thinking that he is an inexperienced fighter, untrustworthy, and a liability. One particular member, Slade (voiced by Ron Perlman), has a personal grudge against Turok because his brother Robert was also a member of Wolf Pack, and was killed in the same battle in Colombia from which Turok had reputedly fled, earning him his dubious reputation. On approach to their destination, their starship is shot down from orbit and crash lands on the terraformed surface, where Turok quickly learns that the jungles covering the planet are inhabited by dinosaurs. Despite being genetically engineered, the dinosaurs are wild and dangerous, and the M-G soldiers have been capturing them to be used as experimental weapons for General Kane, meaning a three-way battle between Whiskey Company, the M-G soldiers, and the dinosaurs takes place throughout the game. Upon crashing, many of Whiskey Company are killed by the crash or are either killed by dinosaurs or M-G soldiers. Upon seeing where the rest of the ship came down, Turok and a fellow survivor, Whiskey Company's senior NCO Sergeant Henderson (voiced by Steve Van Wormer), attempt to contact members of Whiskey Company, but the latter is ambushed and killed by a Utahraptor. Turok then proceeds to find other Whiskey Company members on his own, following wreckage and bodies. He eventually finds Slade, who is less than pleased to meet Turok. They proceed to get to the main crash site, finding Turok's bow in the process. The pair navigate the jungles, an M-G outpost, a dinosaur- infested valley, and a raptor cave. They eventually link up with Reese, Whiskey Company's resident sniper, and stumble upon a group of M-G troops searching starship wreckage for survivors before heading through a lair of feline-like raptors. The group eventually makes their way to the crash site where they find Chief Engineer Carter (voiced by Jason Harris), heavy weapons trooper Jericho (voiced by Christopher Judge), weapons specialist Logan (voiced by William Fichtner), Whiskey Company's medic Parker (voiced by Joshua Gomez), second-in-command Lewis, Company leader Cole, technician and pilot Shepard (voiced by Donnie Wahlberg), and soldiers Foster (voiced by Jon Curry) and Gonzales (voiced by Lombardo Boyar). After resting up, Turok is sent by Cole on a mission to find fellow survivors from the crash. As Turok navigates the forest he comes in contact with John Grimes (voiced by Sean Donnellan), Kane's second-in-command, and is threatened by the former Wolf Pack member for \\"betraying\\" Wolf Pack. Later on, Turok comes across a lone survivor, Cowboy (voiced by Timothy Olyphant). Turok and Cowboy begin a conversation, but it's cut short when Cowboy is injured by Grimes via an arrow to the stomach. The group arrives to Turok's and Cowboy's aid, with the majority thinking it was Turok who injured Cowboy. Logan, suffering what is implied to be brain-damage from a fall sustained during the ship's crash, then testily tasks Turok, Foster, and Gonzales to find the comm unit from the ship's wreckage to attempt to call for help. The marines shortly come across what looked like an abandoned outpost and Foster, who was on point, is shot by a sniper. Turok and Gonzales assault the outpost, before having to defend said outpost from an M-G counterattack. Moving deeper into the jungle, they finally find more wreckage from the ship. Gonzales finds the comm unit on a rocky ledge, and is subsequently ambushed and carried off by Mama Scarface, a T. Rex who has scars on her right side from battles with M-G soldiers. Turok sets off in pursuit. During the chase, Turok ends up in the nest of the T. Rex and is attacked by her offspring, which he kills. When he locates the comm unit, Mama Scarface herself appears and attacks him. During the battle, she gets her right eye knifed, but she throws Turok off and out of her lair. After regaining consciousness, Turok finds that night has fallen and he now has to make his way back to camp while navigating through an abandoned outpost and fighting raptors along the way. Reaching the camp, he informs the others that Foster and Gonzales didn't make it. Slade is not happy about the news and claims that Gonzales was his closest friend. Out of anger, Slade challenges Turok to a knife fight and accuses him of being a traitor. Cowboy, having recovered, defends Turok, and Jericho drags a defiant Slade out of the way. After that argument, Turok gives the comm unit to Cowboy and thanks him for his support. Cole (voiced by Mark Rolston), who is about to inform Turok of something, is suddenly killed by an arrow fired from Grimes and a battle ensues at the camp as M-G troops storm the area. Whiskey Company wins the battle, fending off waves of infantry and even a spider tank, but during the battle Parker is gunned down by Chaingun Troopers and Lewis killed off as well. Even worse, the comm unit was destroyed during the fight. A brief clash for leadership occurs, as Slade posits that no one remaining outranks him, but Logan overrules him as ranking Corporal and assumes command. Jericho then insists that they go hunt down M-G in retaliation for their fellow soldier's deaths but an approaching storm soon changes his mind. Upon hearing a strange noise along with a large light beam in the distance of the forests, Logan orders Turok and Slade to investigate. Knowing that this is a suicide mission, Carter speaks up but is ordered to go with them. The rest of the company then search for a way off of the planet. When they arrive at their destination, a seemingly derelict outpost, they discover that the light emitted was from an APC that was pulled halfway into the ground. Forcing their way into the outpost, they come across a log entry from Kane, detailing scorpion-like bugs with a potent neurotoxin. Carter, who was on a separate computer, soon finds the location of a shuttle in an abandoned substation not far from the main M-G base. Turok relays this info to Logan, only to be attacked by the bugs, which drag Carter underground. Managing to escape from the swarm, Turok and Slade eventually fall into a cave system. Turok then has to navigate the dark caves, fending off bugs before reuniting with Slade at an underground river. Their reunion is cut short as a kraken-like creature emerges from the water and Turok manages to kill it. Slade begrudgingly thanks Turok for saving his life, having now come to respect him. They eventually escape the caves and link up with what's left of Whiskey Company. Upon seeing a patrolling convoy coming for their position, Logan, having by now spiraled into outright paranoia, accuses Turok of drawing M-G soldiers to them since the beginning, and threatens to shoot him. Slade, in a reversal, defends Turok, and accuses Logan of being unstable. The argument draws the attention of the patrol, and a battle begins in which Logan is killed by a gunship and Jericho seemingly sacrifices himself to allow the last of Whiskey Company to flee into the substation. The survivors reach the hangar where the ship is located, only to discover that the ship was long destroyed by the environment. With no other choice, they decide to go to the main M-G base. As the five remaining soldiers reach the M-G Base Reese (voiced by Gideon Emery) discovers a back entrance, however; he is killed by an arrow to his eye from an unseen Grimes. Slade, Shepard, Cowboy and Turok enter the base, indirectly helped by Mama Scarface, who was rampaging at the base's gate. Inside, they come across another log from Kane, stating that he had developed a nerve gas from the scorpion-bugs' blood, a gas that can kill any living creature before dissipating without a trace. To prevent the bio-weapon from leaving the planet, Turok sets charges on the generators. However, he and the others are captured by Kane. During the ensuing argument between Kane and Turok, Cowboy speaks out, saying none of them would have survived this long without Turok, and Kane executes him personally for speaking out of turn. Turok detonates the charges, which results in the death of Grimes. Turok, Shepard, and Slade navigate their way through the collapsing base, battling MG soldiers and raptors. Soon they reach the ship but Turok refuses to board it until Kane is dead, proceeding to shoot down his escape craft and engage him in a knife fight, coming out the victor. Immediately after, Turok is confronted by Mama Scarface, driven insane by the loss of her brood. Turok manages to get a grenade in her ruptured eye, which causes the T. Rex's head to explode. Turok is then picked up by Shepard and Slade in their ship, and the three friends finally escape the planet. Reception Turok received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameTrailers, which gave the game 8.3/10, highlighted the game's use of the Unreal Engine 3, believing it to be \\"the best use of the tech outside of Epic's own efforts\\" and praising the modeling and animation of the dinosaurs in particular. 1UP.com gave the game a score of C+, specifically complaining about its stealth mechanics, the use of camera shaking, and occasional graphical glitches in the PlayStation 3 version. Hyper's Yuri Spadeface commended the game for its \\"solid frame rate\\" but he criticised the \\"frustrating level design and average execution\\". Turok received 3/5 from X-Play, who commented on its aim-assist being woefully inadequate both in multiplayer and singleplayer, but praised its graphics and \\"outlook\\". Turok was a commercial success, shifting over 1 million units in its first two months of sales. The game was popular enough for Propaganda Games to begin working on a sequel for the Xbox 360 before the Touchstone games division was shuttered. Cancelled sequel Turok 2, known chronologically as Turok 6 in various news articles, was a planned and partially developed sequel to Turok from 2008. It was eventually cancelled mid-development, due to many layoffs at Propaganda Games and their eventual closure in 2011.

He stood as a breeding stallion in the United States, Argentina, New Zealand and Japan with mixed results: the best of his other progeny were probably Electronic Unicorn (Hong Kong Horse of the Year in 2002) and Morluc (Woodford Stakes). Bahamian Pirate's dam, Shining Through, was an unraced daughter of the 1981 Canadian Horse of the Year Deputy Minister. Shining Through was a granddaughter of Sex Appeal, an outstanding broodmare who produced Try My Best and El Gran Senor. In September 1996 the yearling was sent to the Keeneland sales but failed to make his reserve price of $42,000. Bahamian Pirate entered the ownership of the Lucayan Stud, the name used for the horse racing interests of Edward St. George. St. George was a British businessman who lived in the Bahamas and gave the \\"Bahamian\\" prefix to the names of many of his racehorses including Bahamian Bounty and Bahamian Knight (Derby Italiano). He was originally sent into training with Con Collins in Ireland but was moved to the stable of David \\"Dandy\\" Nicholls in Yorkshire after his second race. Racing career =1998 & 1999: early career= Unraced as a two-year-old, Bahamian Pirate made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Gowran Park on 3 May 1998 when he finished fifth behind Alonzo. He failed to win in four subsequent races that year, producing his best effort when beaten a head in a maiden at Thirsk Racecourse in September. Early in the following year he finished fourth, third and second in minor races on the synthetic Fibresand surface at Southwell Racecourse before winning a five furlong maiden at Ripon in August. =2000: five-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his debut as a five-year-old, Bahamian Pirate won a minor handicap race at Carlisle Racecourse and then won a similar event at Southwell by eight lengths. In July he finished second in handicaps at Newmarket, Lingfield and Newmarket again before winning a six furlong handicap at Newmarket in August. Nine days after his Newmarket win the gelding contested his first important race when he carried 111 pounds in the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes and finished third behind William's Well. On 2 September he finished unplaced in a handicap before running in the Ayr Gold Cup two weeks later. Ridden by his trainer's son Adrian Nicholls he carried 112 pounds and started a 33/1 outsider in a 28-runner field which included seven other runners from the David Nicholls stable. After being restrained by Adrian Nicholls in the early stages he made rapid progress to take the lead a furlong out and won by one and a quarter lengths from Lago Di Varano. The Scotsman's correspondent described the win as \\"ridiculously easy\\", whilst David Nicholls said that he was glad that he ignored the advice of Frankie Dettori, who recommended that the horse needed to race in blinkers. Adrian Nicholls said \\"I thought the ground might be too soft for him but I was wrong. I've never been going so well in a sprint with two furlongs to run. I waited until I saw the furlong marker and said 'go' and he really went\\". Bahamian Pirate then finished fifth in a seven furlong handicap at Newmarket and was then moved up in class for the Listed Bentinck Stakes over six furlongs at the same track on 13 October. The Cammidge Trophy winner Andreyev was made favourite with Bahamian Pirate, ridden again by Nicholls, started at odds of 9/1. Racing down the far side of the track, (the right-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint), the gelding took the lead a furlong out and won by three quarters of a length from Andreyev. =2001: six- year-old season= Bahamian Pirate, racing in the colours of the Indian businessman Lhendup Dorji was campaigned in major weight-for-age sprints in 2001 and finished unplaced in his first five starts: the Cammidge Trophy, Abernant Stakes, Palace House Stakes, Duke of York Stakes and Golden Jubilee Stakes. He reached the frame for the first time that year on 30 June, when he finished second to the three-year-old Firebolt in the Chipchase Stakes. He then finished ninth in the Sprint Stakes before being sent to Ireland for the Phoenix Sprint Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse on 12 August. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh he started at odds of 7/1 for a race in which the Barry Hills- trained Munjiz and the Aidan O'Brien stable's representative Freud, were made the joint-favourites. Bahamian Pirate raced in third before challenging in the final furlong and caught the leader One Won One in the last strides to win by a short head. The gelding went on to finish third in the Belgrave Stakes and third again in the Diadem Stakes before stepping up to Group One level for the first time in the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp Racecourse in October. Starting a 22/1 outsider he finished strongly to take second place, half a length behind the winner Imperial Beauty. He ended the season by attempting to repeat his 2000 success in the Bentinck Stakes but was beaten into third by Danehurst and Orientor. =2002 & 2003: seven and eight-year-old seasons= At the ages of seven and eight, Bahamian Pirate continued to race in top-class company, but failed to win a race. In twelve races in 2002 he produced his best effort in the Group One July Cup in which he finished second by half a length to Continent. He also finished second in the Phoenix Sprint Stakes and third in the Palace House Stakes. In his first attempt to win the Nunthorpe Stakes he finished eighth behind Kyllachy. In ten starts in 2003 his best results were second places in the Palace House Stakes and a minor stakes race at Goodwood Racecourse. A second bid for the Nunthorpe saw him finishing seventh behind Oasis Dream. =2004: nine-year-old season= On his debut as a nine-year-old. Bahamian Pirate was dropped in class for a minor event at Nottingham Racecourse on 31 March. Ridden by Murtagh, he broke 26-race losing streak and won for the first time in two and a half years as he defeated Fromsong by one and a quarter lengths. In April, the gelding finished fourth to Arakan in the Abernant Stakes and fourth to Tout Seul in the Leicestershire Stakes before finishing runner-up to Steenberg at Haydock on 1 May. He kept up his busy schedule by winning at Beverley Racecourse on 8 May before finishing unplaced behind Monsieur Bond in the Duke of York Stakes three days later. At Royal Ascot in June Bahamian Pirate ran twice without success, finishing seventh to The Tatling in the King's Stand Stakes and eighth to Fayr Jag in the Golden Jubilee Stakes. He then finished unplaced in the Chipchase Stakes and the July Cup: in the latter race he finished seventeenth of the twenty runners behind the five-year-old mare Frizzante. On 23 July, the gelding was ridden by Kieren Fallon in a minor stakes race at Newmarket and started second favourite behind the Middle Park Stakes winner Balmont. After racing towards the rear of the field he kept on strongly in the closing stages to take the lead 50 yards from the finish and won by a neck from Balmont. Six days later at Goodwood he finished sixth in the King George Stakes, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Ringmoor Down. On 19 August on his favoured soft ground, Bahamian Pirate, ridden by Seb Sanders, made his third attempt to win the Nunthorpe Stakes and started a 16/1 outsider in a twelve runners field. The Irish-trained One Cool Cat started favourite head of Orientor, Airwave (Cheveley Park Stakes), Balmont and The Tatling, whilst the other runners were Avonbridge, Moss Vale (Sandy Lane Stakes), Fayr Jag and Fire Up The Band (City Walls Stakes) as well as the outsiders Night Prospector and Talbot Avenue. Fire Up The Band led before Airwave took over after two furlongs with Bahamian Pirate close behind. The gelding came under pressure in the last quarter mile but stayed on strongly to overtake the weakening Airwave inside the final furlong and won by a neck from The Tatling with One Cool Cat taking third ahead of Avonbridge and Orientor. David Nicholls said \\"The ground is the most important thing for him. He can compete on soft ground like this. He might be nine, but he doesn't look it and he is racing full of confidence\\". He also commented \\"I suppose because of his age a few people will knock the form and suggest it was a sub-standard Nunthorpe. They can think what they like, but he is still a good horse and he might get more credit for his win if he was trained down south. Bahamian Pirate lost his way for a while but he has been running well lately and it has helped to restore his confidence. You can't let him fall out of the gate. He needs somebody to get hold of him and let him know who is boss and Seb Sanders did just that\\". Bahamian Pirate's performance made him the oldest horse up to that point to win a Group One race in the United Kingdom and led to his being named Britain's \\"star performer\\" for August 2004. Bahamian Pirate failed to reproduce his York form in two subsequent starts that year, finishing unplaced in both the Haydock Sprint Cup and the Prix de l'Abbaye. =2005-2007: later career= In 2005 Bahamian Pirate embarked on another long winless streak and finished unplaced in all eight of his starts as a ten-year-old. He failed to win again in thirteen starts as an eleven-year-old in 2006 but did produce some good performances in defeat including a third place under 125 pounds in the Wokingham Stakes. The gelding raced at Southwell in early 2007, by which time he was racing for the Dandy Nicholls Racing Club, and was beaten in his first two races. He was without a win in two and a half years and on a losing run of 25 races when he started at odds of 12/1 for a minor handicap under top weight of 130 pounds. Commenting on the gelding's return to the fibresand track his trainer had said, \\"he's in good form and I think he knows more about racing than I do\\". Ridden by Adrian Nicholls he stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Saviours Spirit. It proved to be his final success as he was beaten in ten subsequent races that year although he did finish second in minor handicaps at Ascot and Thirsk. The twelve-year-old ended his racecourse career by finishing fourteenth of the twenty-two runners in the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes at Ripon on 18 August 2007.

MC C. de G. (19 April 1891 in Woollahra, Sydney – 22 August 1983 in Sydney) was an Australian geographer, geologist, war hero, historian and translator.Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, 2004, \\"Aurousseau, Marcel\\" (4 September 2015). G. J. McCarthy 2009, \\"Aurousseau, Marcel (1891-1983)\\" , Australian Encyclopedia of Science (4 September 2015). Aurousseau, who was of French and Irish descent, attended Sydney Boys High School alongside three students who were also later prominent in various fields: Arthur Wheen (a historian and translator), Raymond Kershaw (an economist) and Arthur McLaughlin (a medical practitioner).John Ramsland, 2015, The Other Side of No Man’s Land: Arthur Wheen World War I Hero, Melbourne, Brolga Publishing, p. 310. He began his scientific career as an \\"office boy\\" at the Australian Museum in Sydney. While completing the Bachelor of Science course at the University of Sydney, Aurousseau won the University Medal in Geology. In 1913, he was appointed to the position of assistant lecturer at the newly formed geology department of the University of Western Australia (UWA), in Perth.  Army service  Following the outbreak of World War I, Aurousseau obtained leave from UWA, to join the Australian Imperial Force. He was assigned initially to the 28th Battalion (1915), before joining the 51st Battalion on the Western Front.University of Sydney, 2015, Marcel Aurousseau: Book of Remembrance Entry (4 September 2015). Aurousseau first saw action in France at the battles of Fleurbaix (Fromelles), the Pozières and the Mouquet Farm (14–15 August 1916), which resulted in him being severely wounded. He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross. Promoted to Captain, Aurousseau also served at the Battle of Messines, the Third Battle of Ypres (Polygon Wood), the First Battle of Dernancourt (part of the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux), and was wounded again at Hourges, during the Battle of Amiens, in August 1918. As a result of his war service, Aurousseau was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre (1919). Scientific and literary career Returning to Perth the war, Aurousseau again taught geology at UWA. He subsequently moved to the United States, to work at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution, in Washington DC. During 1923–24, Aurousseau worked for the American Geographical Society in New York. After returning briefly to Australia, Aurousseau moved to London to pursue a literary career. Between 1936 and 1955 he worked as executive secretary of the British Government Permanent Committee on Geographical Names. During World War II, Aurousseau contributed to military geographical dictionaries used by Allied forces. In 1956 he declined the award of an MBE. In his most influential work, The Rendering of Geographical Names (1957), Aurousseau coined the term exonym:Marcel Aurousseau, 1957, The Rendering of Geographical Names, London, Hutchinson, pp. 2–3, and; Kelsey B. Harder, 1996, \\"The term\\", in: Ernst Eichler & Walter de Gruyter (eds), Namenforschung/Name Studies/Les noms propres. 2. Halbband+Registerband, Berlin, Walter de Gruyter, p. 1012. a place name that is the common name only in countries or regions outside the place in question, usually for historical reasons. Usage of \\"exonym\\" has grown to include non-geographical proper names for things such as languages, cultures or populations. Some significant examples of exonyms therefore include: the English language \\"China\\" for Zhōngguó; the Spanish word estadounidenses (lit. \\"unitedstatesians\\") for \\"Americans\\", and; the English \\"German\\" for Deutsch. In 1969, the Royal Geographical Society presented Aurousseau with the Victoria Medal, an annual award \\"for conspicuous merit in research in geography\\".

Description and history The former Saco Central Fire Station is set between Thornton Avenue and Pleasant Streets, just north of Saco's Main Street central business district. It is a two-story steel and masonry structure, its exterior finished in brick and cast stone. It has a flat roof, and a hose drying tower at its southeast corner. A rear section is one story in height, set at a different elevation due to the sloping lot. The main facade, facing north toward Thornton Avenue, is five bays wide, with former vehicle bays on the ground floor and pairs of sash windows above. The bays are articulated by brick pilasters, some of which are quoined. The vehicle bay openings have segmented arch tops with alternating brick and cast stone elements, except the rightmost bay, which was squared to allow for taller vehicles. The central bay has had a projecting bay window built into it. Above the second floor is a cornice of cast stone, above which is a band of brick in which \\"Saco Fire Station\\" has been lettered in cast stone, using an Art Deco-style font. The city of Saco began using the Thornton Avenue site for fire services as early as the 1870s. Its fire department became completely motorized around 1930, and the old firehouse, dating to the 1870s, was deteriorating in condition. The city received funding from the Public Works Administration, and built this building in 1938 to a design by Portland architect Lester I. Beal, of Miller & Beal, Inc. It was built behind the older station, which remained in service, taking and demolishing residences facing Pleasant Street in the construction process. The old station was then demolished. The station remained in active service until 2011, when the fire department moved to new facilities on North Street. Although the city sought to sell the building to a developer, this proposal was rejected, and the city rehabilitated the building into a mixed- use residential and commercial property.

Biography Wilton, the son of a diplomat, spent much of his teenage life living in London. Although he boarded at Xavier College in Kew, inside Hawthorn's zone, as his residence was in London he was not affected by zoning. As a result both Melbourne and St Kilda tried to recruit him to their clubs, in addition to Hawthorn. He was playing at this time for Old Xaverians in VAFA. In the end he opted for Hawthorn, as they were the more dominant side of that era. A key-position player, Wilton started at Hawthorn in the 1978 VFL season, a premiership winning year. He debuted in Hawthorn's round nine win over St Kilda at Moorabbin Oval, his only senior appearance for the season. In 1979 he played nine games for Hawthorn in a season that was interrupted by a knee injury, which required an operation. Following a knee reconstruction, Wilton returned late in the 1980 season to play two games. During his time at Hawthorn, Wilton was also a medical student, which by 1981 was proving too difficult a combination. In his fifth year, he was required as part of his studies to live in a hospital and work long shifts. He had to swap shifts with other students in order to attend training. In the 1981 VFL season he played just one senior game for Hawthorn. He was advised by the Dean of Medicine that he would have to give up football if he wanted to continue and he made the decision to retire from the VFL. In 1983 he returned to Old Xaverians and spent five seasons at the club. He finished second in the Woodrow Medal in 1984. Wilton now works as a radiologist in Melbourne.

Despite his parents insisting he focus on his school subjects, Lanaris followed a football career. At age eleven he joined Pontioi Veria where his coach Giorgos Kykeridis, later technical director of Veria F.C., spotted him and focused Lanaris's progress. At the time Kykeridis stated, \\"This kid knows how to play football; he can go far as a player, and he's got a left foot that is rare for our sport.\\" Lanaris soon became a recognizable talent in the Imathia region.Αφιέρωμα στο Γιώργο Λαναρή =Iraklis= In the summer of 1998, Iraklis F.C. approached Lanaris and, after coming to an agreement with Pontioi, signed them to their club.

At the end of the 1998–1999 season he returned to Iraklis but wasn't able to make the main squad due to the presence of established talent such as Savvas Kofidis and Ieroklis Stoltidis.

His first two seasons saw no appearances for Veria in Delta Ethniki, but the team managed to secure promotion to Gamma Ethniki and win the Amateur Cup against Preveza. As the club began play in Gamma Ethniki the following season, Lanaris was able to earn a spot on the main squad and played in thirty-three games, scoring seven times, and helped the club avoid relegation. The next season, 2004–2005, would be the best of Lanaris's career. He played in thirty matches and he scored seventeen goals, leading Veria's return to Football League as Gamma Ethniki champions. In his first season in Football League, he played twenty-five times and he scored eight goals. The following season, 2006–2007, Lenaris lost his main squad role after an dispute with Giorgos Arvanitidis, then-president and owner of the club. As a result he played in only eight matches that season, but the club was still able to achieve promotion to Superleague. After Veria's promotion to Superleague, Lanaris decided to sign a contract to Apollon Kalamaria as he considered himself a free agent. However, Arvanitidis disagreed and claimed Lanaris had signed a \\"1 plus 1\\" contract, binding him to the club for the following season. The case went to the Hellenic Football Federation court where Veria won the case and Lanaris was forced to return. In Superleague, Lanaris made no appearances as the dispute with club ownership caused him to permanently lose his spot on the team. He was released by the club on 30 June 2008 as his contract expired. =Apollon Kalamaria= Apollon Kalamaria had just been relegated to Football League along with Veria and Atromitos, and team manager Makis Katsavakis was still eager to sign the newly available Lanaris. Upon Lanaris's release by Veria, Katsavakis quickly signed the footballer to a contract, but unfortunately Lanaris did not impress at Kalamaria and was released during the 2008 winter transfer window after playing in only four matches.Αφιέρωμα στο Γιώργο Λαναρή =Aetos Skydra= The new year would find Lanaris joining Aetos Skydras. He failed to make any appearances for the club and he was released on a free transfer in the summer of 2009.Αφιέρωμα στο Γιώργο Λαναρή =Pierikos= Lanaris joined Pierikos for the season 2009–2010 but he only played in two matches. He was released on another free transfer during the 2010 winter transfer window.Αφιέρωμα στο Γιώργο Λαναρή =Return to Veria= As he reached the age of thirty-two, Lanaris had few options. After resolving his issue with Arvanitidis, Lanaris returned home to Veria, who was back in Gamma Ethniki for the 2009–2010 season. There he finally returned to form and regained his spot in the main squad, scoring five times in fourteen appearances and helping to lead Veria to the Gamma Ethniki championship and promotion to Football League. In the season that followed, Lanaris played another thirteen matches in Football League as the club was saved from relegation. The 2011–2012 season would be his last as a football player, but he left on a high note as he made seventeen appearances to help lead Veria to a second-place finish and a return to Superleague. It would be Lanaris's final act as a player for the club to which he had dedicated his life back in 2004. =Team manager= After retiring from football in summer of 2012, Arvanitidis named Lanaris as team manager on 7 July 2012. Lanaris attempted to resign from the post on 27 January 2013 claiming personal reasons, but his resignation was not accepted.Γενικός Αρχηγός ο Λαναρής 2015 Greek football scandal In 2015, Lanaris and Veria owner Giorgos Arvanitidis were accused of fixing a match between Veria and Olympiakos F.C. on 6 January 2013. Veria player Nikolaos Georgeas and then-manager Dimitris Kalaitzidis both testified in March 2015 that Lanaris, following Arvanitidis's orders, instructed the players to lose the match by a 3–0 score, which was ultimately the final tally. According to the investigating judge Georgios Andreadis, both Arvanitidis and Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis had agreed on the match fixing. On 6 May 2015, Mr. Andreadis ruled that both Lanaris and Arvanitidis were guilty of fixing matches. Lanaris was immediately banned from any football activity, forced to leave his team manager position at Veria, and was barred from leaving the country. However, the HFF appeals committee overturned that ruling and found Arvanitidis, Lanaris, and Veria not guilty of the accusations.Εκτός ποδοσφαίρου και ο Λαναρής Honours =Veria F.C.= *Football League (Greece): 2 **Runner-up: 2011–12 **Third place: 2006–07 *Gamma Ethniki: 2 **Winner (2): 2004–05, 2009–10 References Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:People from Veria Category:Greek footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Football League (Greece) players Category:Apollon Pontou FC players Category:Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Veria F.C. players ","title":"Giorgos Lanaris"},{"id":"47719346","text":"Charles Bernard Beard was Dean of Glasgow and Galloway from 1937 to 1943.\\"Scottish Episcopal Clergy, 1689-2000\\" Bertie, D.M p596: Edinburgh T & T Clark He was born on 7 December 1870,University Story educated at the University of Glasgow;and ordained deacon in 1895, and priest in 1896.Crockfords (London, OUP, 1929/30) p 82 After curacies in Dundee and Glasgow he was Rector of Peterhead from 1902 untilScottish Postal Directories 1905; and of Helensburgh from 1905 until his death on 11 February 1943.Deaths.

Her goal was to bridge the gap between first- and second-generation Korean-Americans, but was foremost concerned with the well-being of the Korean community in Hawaii.  Dance  Before Whang began her work, \\"respectable\\" Korean women did not dance, and men did so only when they were intoxicated.

History The Union was established in Geneva on 20 May 1838 by Johannes Niederer, and was initially a discussion club for tradespeople. The name was taken from Rütli, an important location in establishing the Old Swiss Confederacy. The organisation initially focussed on education, but later started political activity, playing a leading role in the establishments of trade unions and health insurance. However, it declined after the 1860s following the establishment of the International Workingmen's Association. In 1878 the Union agreed to adopt a socialist platform,Donald F Busky (2002) Communism in History and Theory: the European experience, Greenwood Publishing Group, p61 although it refused to merge with the Swiss Workers' Federation.

In response to Muller's X-ray experiments in the late 1920s, they turned their attention to mutation and population genetics.Jonathan Harwood, Styles of Scientific Thought: The German Genetics Community, 1900-1933\\" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), https://books.google.com/books?id=dygUxfsyaTwC (accessed 10 June 2015), 55-56.

On the recommendation of N. K. Koltsov, director of Moscow's Institute of Experimental Biology, the Timofeef- Ressovskys were recruited by Oskar Vogt to work at Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in 1925. Official reluctance to let the couple leave Russia and enter Germany were overcome in part due to Helena's German ancestry.Rokityanskij, 574. A number of other Russians, including Sergei R. Zarapkin and his family, technical assistant Natalie Kromm, and the Timofeeff- Ressovskys' nanny, were in residence at the Institute.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 19. Berlin was a comfortable place for women in the sciences: Cécile and Marthe Vogt, Estera Tenenbaum, Stella Rose, Rosa Schragenheim, Irmgard Leux, and Gertrud Soeken also worked at the Institute.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 18. Following the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the political climate became increasingly uncomfortable in Germany. The Institute was pressured to dismiss foreigners, women, and Jews. Helena officially retired, though she continued to collaborate with her husband.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 20. Despite the efforts of Nikolai and Oskar Vogt, Tenenbaum was forced out of the Institute (and country) in 1934;Annette B. Vogt, \\"Estera Tenenbaum,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tenenbaum-estera (accessed 3 September 2015). facilitated by a research grant, Marthe Vogt left Germany in 1935.Finding aid, Dr. Marthe Louise Vogt collection, Library (accessed 4 September 2015). The situation in the Soviet Union was perilous: members of Nikolai and Helena's families were arrested and some were killed. Colleagues warned against returning home; when ordered to do so in 1937, Nikolai refused.Zhores A. Medvedev, \\"Nikolai Wladimirovich Timofeeff-Ressovsky,\\" Joint Institute for Nuclear Research website, http://wwwinfo.jinr.ru/drrr/Timofeeff/auto/med.html (accessed 3 September 2015). He used competing offers from the United States to negotiate improved working conditions in his Berlin laboratory.Paul and Krimbas, 88-9. Helena's eldest son was arrested by the Germans in 1943 and her husband by the Russians in 1945. Their fate remained uncertain, but Helena was able to continue working in Berlin while her younger son resumed his studies. From 1946-1947, she worked under Hans Nachtsheim at Berlin University's Zoological Institute. In 1947, she received word that Nikolai was alive, and in August Helena and Andrei joined him in the Urals.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 20-1. Helena once more worked as a researcher in a department headed by her husband, first in the Urals and then, for the last decade of her life, the Institute of Medical Radiology near Moscow. She continued her scientific work, though she received no salary and opportunities for publication were often limited by the secret nature of her work.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 21-2. During this period, she worked on problems of radiation ecology and population genetics, though the study of genetics was generally disallowed in the Soviet Union until the mid-60s. She was part of the first group in the USSR to study Arabidopsis genetics.Medvedev. Helena died in 1973; the loss was a serious blow for the husband whose scientific work and political travails had always overshadowed hers.Vogt, \\"Ein russisches,\\" 22.

It is approximately long and flows through Northmoreland Township and Exeter Township in Wyoming County and Franklin Township and Exeter Township in Luzerne County. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It has one named tributary, which is known as Mill Creek. The surficial geology in the vicinity of Whitelock Creek mainly consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and alluvial terrace. Major land uses in the watershed of Whitelock Creek include forested land and agricultural land. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek. Its watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Trout have been observed in Whitelock Creek, as have numerous macroinvertebrate taxa. Course Whitelock Creek looking upstream Whitelock Creek begins on a hill in Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County. It flows south-southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning east and then southeast. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek enters Franklin Township, Luzerne County and flows into Perrins Marsh. In Perrins Marsh, it reenters Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County and flows north-northeast for a few tenths of amile. It then turns east-northeast for a few miles, flowing along a valley that gradually narrows. The creek enters Exeter Township, Wyoming County and briefly passes into Exeter Township, Luzerne County before reentering Exeter Township, Wyoming County. It then turns north-northeast for a few miles before turning east and receiving Mill Creek, its only named tributary, from the left. The creek continues flowing east along the border of the census-designated place of West Falls before crossing Pennsylvania Route 92 and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Whitelock Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. =Tributaries= Whitelock Creek has one named tributary, which is known as Mill Creek. Mill Creek joins Whitelock Creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Whitelock Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology along the lower reaches of Whitelock Creek mainly consists of alluvium. The sides of its valley have surficial geology featuring Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of coal, conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale. There is also a patch of alluvial terrace near the creek's mouth. The surficial geology further upstream is fairly similar except that there is little Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift or alluvium at the headwaters and that the bedrock consists only of sandstone and shale. There are at least of pipeline in the watershed of Whitelock Creek. This pipeline crosses a number of streams. Watershed The watershed of Whitelock Creek has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Ransom. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Center Moreland. A dam known as Perrins Marsh Dam is situated on Whitelock Creek. The dam is classified as a \\"significant hazard\\" dam, as of 1981. At this point in time, a dam failure could have caused damage to properties and bridges further downstream, as well as possibly killing several people. The main land use in the watershed of Whitelock Creek is forested land. However, agricultural land is also present in significant amounts. In the early 1980s, the land downstream of the Perrins Marsh Dam was mainly rural residential land for approximately . Further downstream, it flowed through a largely uninhabited valley. History Whitelock Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199788. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2011/Village Road was built over Whitelock Creek in 1941 and is long. A bridge of the same type was built over the creek in 1945 east of Center Moreland. This bridge is and carries T348/Lockville Road. A third bridge of the same type was built over the creek in 1945 and was repaired in 1996. It is long and carries T336. A concrete slab bridge carrying State Route 2009/Brace Road over Whitelock Creek was constructed in 1961 and is long. In 2007, a concrete box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 92 over the creek was built. This bridge is long. A cleanup of flood debris and gravel on Whitelock Creek was planned in 2006. In 2012, several members of the National Civilian Community Corps cleaned up debris along Whitelock Creek. One bridge over the creek is considered to be structurally deficient. Biology The drainage basin of Whitelock Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek and its tributary Mill Creek from their upper reaches downstream to their mouths. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in Whitelock Creek. At one site in the summer of 2012, 162 individuals from 17 taxa were observed at the creek. These included four beetle genera, three dragonfly genera, two caddisfly genera, two mayfly genera, and two stonefly genera. The clam genus Sphaerium, the crayfish genus Orconectes, the helgrammite genus Corydalus, and the midge family Chironomidae were also observed. The EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa richness value was 6 and the Becks Index Version 3 value was 8. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value was 3.994 and the Shannon Diversity Index value was 1.924. At another site on Whitelock Creek, 148 individuals from 11 macroinvertebrate taxa were observed in the summer of 2012.

The branch opened in 1869 for mineral traffic. In 1905 the LNWR began an innovative passenger service along the branch using steam Railmotors. The halt opened with the new service. It was situated in open country next to an overbridge carrying the road to Rhuddlan. Although the road is shown as \\"Meliden Road\\" on both maps of the era and modern maps the halt was named Rhuddlan Road. In the 1920s the substantial Woodland Park housing estate was built between the line and Prestatyn, utterly changing the character of the area. The halt was renamed Woodland Park in 1923 to reflect this new market. Railmotors had retracting steps so conventional raised platforms were not needed. The halt was therefore built with a very short ground level platform. Initially it had no waiting facilities whatever, but by 1910 a cabin little larger than two phone booths was provided. The passenger service lasted only until 1930, when it was withdrawn by the LMS. The line remained open to serve a quarry at Dyserth until complete closure in 1973. Since closure most of the former railway has been converted into a footpath. At the former station site visitors on this walk will notice the ground being higher up on the left when walking from Prestatyn towards Dyserth; this was probably where the platform would have been.

The correct receptor needs to be present on the cells surface to be able to respond to the signal. Signals pass from protein to protein when the signal travels through the cell membrane entering the cell. The signal continues its journey to its destination, be it the nucleus or any of the other structures or organelles in the cell. When these signals are transmitted between proteins, the proteins are modified creating a signaling pathway that can lead to a specific part of the cell or branch out sending the signal to multiple parts of the cell. As the signal moves from each receptor in the proteins, it can be amplified changing a small signal into a large response by dividing and amplifying the signal. A signaling pathway is like the way relay runners work together. The signal is transferred from the receptor on one protein to the receptor on the other protein the same way a relay runner hands off from one runner to the next. A proteins direct cellular response when it reaches its destination is to begin to alter the behavior of the cell. The cell can respond in an array of ways, depending on the molecules involved in the signaling. A signal activates an enzyme that disassembles a larger molecule. A signal can also direct a vesicle to fuse with the plasma membrane and releases its content on the exterior of the cell. Another response that the cell may have is the signal directs actin molecules to assemble into filament allowing the cell to change shape. A carrier protein delivers a signal to a nuclear pore where it can enter the nucleus and turn the gene on or off. Cells can assimilate multiple signals and every cell collects a multifaceted combination of signals that all require the cell to respond simultaneously transmitting different signals though different signaling pathways. The cell assimilates the data from the signal to multiple signaling pathways to obtain the proper response.  Types of cell communication  One of the way the cells can communicate with each other through a process called cell junction. Cell junction can happen in many forms, but the three main forms of cell junction are gap junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes. = Gap junctions = Gap junctions have a very crucial job that cause a tube to form between the 2 cells allowing in the transport of ions and water. Gap junction tubes help the cells to spread electrochemical signals from cell to cell. Electrochemical signals are the product of action potentials that occur in neurons and cardiac cells. Without gap junctions, we would not be able to have a beating heart or functioning nervous system. Gap junctions showing transport of signal molecule between adjascent cells = Tight signals = Tight signals are just about what the sound like. The 2 cells are squished up against each other, directly connecting the 2 cells membranes, but the contents of the cell are not connected since there is no tube running between the cells. This type of cell connection takes place where certain fluids need to be contained in certain parts of the body like intestines, kidneys, and the bladder. This junction forms a water tight seal, prohibiting the fluids contained in these organs from circulating at will through the body. = Desmosome cell junctions = Desmosome cell junctions physically hold the cells together, but do not allow the cells to pass materials between each other like in gap junction. Desmosome junctions connect the cell with a thread like substance that also connect to the cytoskeleton aiding in the structural support of the cell. These types of junctions are found in areas of the body that undergo a lot of stress, require a lot of flexibility, and movement such as the epidermis and intestines. Desmosomes contain the molecule Cadherins which are also signal receptors. Cadherin of one cell works as the receptor for cadherin in neighbouring cell. Cadherin plays role in contact inhibition Cell Biology by Pollard et al  When cells have a communication breakdown  The breakdown of cell communication result in many forms of diseases and the different types of communication breakdown produce different diseases. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the product when a signal is lost and does not reach its target. In MS the nerve cells protective wrapping found in the brain and spinal cord, get destroyed affecting the nerve cells where they can no longer send signals from one part of the brain to another resulting in the loss of functions such as movement. When the target receptor ignores the signal completely, we end up with the diseases type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes the insulin signal is unable to be produced, while in type 2 diabetes the cells have lost the ability to respond to the signals, resulting in abnormally high and dangerous sugar levels in the blood. A stroke results in the production of too much signaling, where dying brain cells release a large amount of glutamate, killing off healthy brain cells leading to widespread damage to the brain. Glutamate is the molecule responsible for many functions in the brain when produced in low concentrates, but when produced in high concentrations is extremely toxic. Excitotoxicity is the spread of highly concentrated glutamine that kill off healthy brain cells not affected by the stroke. Multiple breakdowns in cell communication result in the uncontrolled growth of cells. When one breakdown occurs, the cell gains the ability to grow and divide with out the signal telling it to do so. A cell has the ability to activate a self- destruct sequence (RNAi) to control the unregulated growth of the cell, but when multiple breakdowns occur, the cell loses the ability to self-destruct and the cell divides uncontrollably mutating and creating a tumor. Further cell communication causes blood cells to grow inside the tumor making it grow larger, while more signaling allow the cancerous cells to be spread throughout the body.  RNA interference  In cells, DNA is housed in the nucleus and it never leaves. The DNA within the nucleus is transcribed by tRNA, and the transcriptions of the DNA become RNA. The RNA (ribonucleic acid) leaves the nucleus to float freely around the cytoplasm, and it contains the instructions of the DNA that are vital to the coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. The ribosomes then take the RNA messages and turn them into proteins that build cells. When a virus enters a cell and inserts its DNA code into the nucleus, it gets transcribed and released into the cell for the ribosome to make it into a protein. This is how viral infections occur. The cell then explodes with the overproduction of the virus, releasing it into the body to infect any and all other cells it finds. It is theorized that through evolution, cells developed a defense system called RNA interference (RNAi) to stop the production of the proteins that have suspicious mirror image messages of the RNA. They don’t just destroy the suspicious messages, but the correct messages as well to stop all production of that message. This is a cell’s self-destruct mechanism and every cell, plant and animal, have RNAi: a way to turn off the production of a certain gene inside the protein. = RNAi therapy = RNAi therapy is currently being tested in the treatment of cancer. Scientists are trying to harness the RNAi's ability to destroy the genetic code that gets expressed as a cancer cell.  Communication in cancer  Cancer cells will communicate via gap junctions most of the time, and the proteins that form these gap junctions are known as connexins. These connexins have been shown to suppress cancer cells, but this suppression is not the only thing that connexins facilitates. Connexins can also promote tumor progression; therefore, this makes connexins only conditional tumor suppressors. However, this relationship that connects cells makes the spreading of drugs through a system much more effective as small molecules can pass through gap junctions and spread the drug much more quickly and efficiently. The idea that increasing cell communication, or more specifically, connexins, to suppress tumors has been a long, ongoing debate that is supported by the fact that so many types of cancer, including liver cancer, lack the cell communication that characterizes normal cells.

The club was founded in 1907 specifically to provide a Jewish country club for the St. Louis area, and was first built in the town of Glendale. By 1927 many of the members' households had moved westward to the Central West End and the towns of Clayton and Ladue, so farmland was purchased in what is now Westwood and a new club built, with the course designed by Paddock and the clubhouse by the firm of Maritz and Young. There were, at that time, also riding stables. The club maintains a low public profile (there is no sign at the entrance, and the address was unpublished until recently) and a refined ambiance; conducting business on the premises is frowned upon, and money never changes hands between members and staff.

He worked closely with his workers, although he abhorred socialism.The Schwabes, Middltonis.co.uk, Retrieved 4 October 2015 This view was not shared by Julie who could see benefits if it fed those in need. Salis Schwabe bought an established mill that had once been damaged in Luddite riots. The Schwabes became very rich from this cotton print factory but they also supplied the funds to establish a school and a library for their employees. Schwabe was known for entertaining which was done at Crumpsall House near Manchester, a leisure residence Glyn Garth near Beaumaris and a house in Paris. They moved into Crumpsall House in 1848 and this was a Georgian styled house with grounds, stables and sixteen staff who, according to the 1851 census, were looking after the Schwabes and their seven children and guests. The staff included nurses and at one time she employed Celestine Doudet as a governess. After Doudet left their employ, she was charged with murder in Paris. Doudet had been employed to take a Dr Marsden's five daughters to Paris where she was to \\"cure\\" them of masturbation. Marsden and Doudet had introduced restraints and punishments to try and cure the girls. Marsden threatened to abandon his daughters if they could not desist. Mary Ann Marsden died from cruelty and starvation or as Doudet said from whooping cough. Schwabe appeared at her trial as a character witness and when Doudet was found guilty of causing the death (reduced on appeal to cruelty) Schwabe tried unsuccessfully to get the novelist Charles Dickens to intercede. The Schwabes toured Europe with Richard Cobden and his wife as they campaigned for free trade. They arranged for Frederic Chopin to visit to raise funds for an infirmary in Manchester. He stayed with them at Crumpsall House, and if he had stayed a few days more he would have met Jenny Lind, who was the next celebrity to be a house guest. Jenny Lind raised £1,000 for Giuseppe Garibaldi. Schwabe had just sent relief supplies to Garibaldi in 1860 and the following year she formed the Italian Ladies' Philanthropic Association. The Lind concert was part of £3,000 that she raised to fund food and education. Schwabe personally organised the education as she set up an elementary school in Naples which ran for five years until the head teacher, Emily Reeve, died of cholera. The school had to close but Schwabe did not lose interest in education. In 1873 Schwabe decided to start another educational institution in Naples and she leased the Collegio Medico for that purpose. She had originally intended to base the school on the ideas of William Ellis but she was further inspired by the ideas of Froebel. Froebelbelieved in learning to play rather than by rote. She wanted the children to learn the basics of education as well as skills that they could use to establish livelihoods. Schwabe's schools in Naples were gaining small contributions from the Italian and Neapolitan politicians as well as coverage in the British press by 1876. In the 1890s she brought her ideas back to England where she helped fund the Froebel Education Institute. Schwabe was said to have raised £2,000 by being more frugal with her lifestyle. She persuaded Claude Montefiore and Sir William Mather to assist and Leopold and Maria de Rothschild gave their support. The project also enjoyed the support of Empress Frederick. The 1894 meeting was at the Rothschild's house in Picadilly when the leading people spoke. George William Kekewich, Secretary of the government education department, gave his support with Montefiore as treasurer and Mather as chair. Schwabe died in Naples in 1896 at the former Collegio Medico. The school had been renamed in 1887 the \\"Institico Froebeliano Internazionale Vittorio Emanuele II\\" and by 1889 it had about 950 pupils divided between five schools that took children from five to eighteen with the option of a years teacher training.

He is best known for the song \\"Tiny Bubbles\\" from the album of the same name. Life and career Ho was a singer of Native Hawaiian, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, and German descent. He was born in the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kakaako to Emily (Honey) Leimaile Silva and James Ah You Puao Ho, but he grew up in Kāneohe on the windward side of the island of Oahu. He was a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools in 1949 and he attended Springfield College on a football scholarship in 1950, but returned home to earn a Bachelor's degree in sociology at University of Hawai'i in 1953. In 1954, Ho entered the United States Air Force doing his primary training at Columbus AFB, Mississippi and spent time flying C-97s with the Military Air Transport Service. Transferred to Travis AFB, California, he went to the local city of Concord and bought an electronic keyboard from a music store, and recalls, \\"That's when it all started.\\" Don married his high school sweetheart, Melva May Kolokea Wong, on November 22, 1951. She was the mother to his first six children. They were married for 48 years, until Melva's death on June 8, 1999. While in the military, Ho traveled from state to state with his young family until he was called home to help his mother with the family bar business called Honey's. Ho left the United States Air Force in 1959 due to his mother's developing illness and began singing at her club in Kaneohe. Honey's became a hotspot for the local entertainment and the growing customers from the Kaneohe Marine Base servicemen. Ho always honored the military remembering his own years of military service. In 1963, he moved the Kāneohe Honey's to Waikīkī. After much success, and little room to grow, promoter Kimo Wilder McVay sought Don to play at a night club called Duke's owned by Duke Kahanamoku, where he caught the attention of record company officials. Ho was originally signed to Reprise Records.McLellan, Dennis (April 15, 2007).Don Ho, 76; singer was best known for 66 hit 'Tiny Bubbles'. Los Angeles Times Ho released his debut album, Don Ho Show, in 1965 and began to play high-profile locations in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and New York City. In 1966 he released his second album, a live compilation called Don Ho – Again!, which charted in the early part of that year. In the fall of 1966, Ho released his most famous song, \\"Tiny Bubbles\\", which charted on both the pop (#57 Billboard) and easy listening charts and caused his subsequent album, also called \\"Tiny Bubbles\\", to remain in the album Top 200 for almost a year. Another song associated with Don was \\"Pearly Shells\\". From 1964 to 1969, Don's backing group was The Aliis: Al Akana, Rudy Aquino, Benny Chong, Manny Lagodlagod and Joe Mundo. In his stage show, Ho would make jokes about being sent in the mid-1950s to Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi and being Hawaiian. Don Ho enjoyed asking for a show of hands of veterans of World War II. He would ask for all the Pearl Harbor survivors to stand. He would tell the men from the European Theater, \\"you got your glory in the movies\\" that they could watch. The veterans of the Pacific Theater were invited on stage to join the hula dancers. Ho's music used typical 1960s pop arrangements, which meant light instrumentation and Hammond organs. He was well-positioned to capitalize on the newly admitted state's growing popularity as a tourist destination during the decade due to cheap air travel and the popularity of Tiki bars. His shows would be attended by celebrities in addition to ordinary tourists. During the second half of the decade, a growing movement emerged in Hawaii to produce more traditional forms of music that subtly accused Ho of being too commercialized and marketed to tourists. His popularity never seriously suffered however, and his shows remained popular with vacationers. Guest appearances on television series such as I Dream of Jeannie, The Brady Bunch, Sanford and Son, Batman, Charlie's Angels, McCloud and Fantasy Island soon followed. Although his album sales peaked in the late 1960s, he was able to land a television series on ABC from October 1976 to March 1977 with The Don Ho Show variety program which aired on weekday mornings.The Motley Fool (March 31, 2006).

In 1995, at age 65, Ho suffered a mild stroke and his health began a steady decline. By 2002, he had developed cardiomegaly, an enlarged heart, unrelated to coronary artery disease, leaving him with only 30% of normal cardiac capacity. Despite his failing health, Ho was always hopeful, and resilient to find a solution to his health issues. He also continued his nightly performances, making a few concessions such as trading in his glass of Scotch that he kept on top of his piano at shows for pineapple juice. Ho was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2005 and had a pacemaker implanted.Ryan, Tim (December 23, 2005). Ho comes to terms with getting older. Honolulu Star Bulletin Ho still experienced a number of problems afterwards, including an episode when his pacemaker malfunctioned during a concert. On another occasion, he was making repairs to the roof of his house when his heart suddenly started racing. He contacted a biotechnology company specializing in treating heart conditions with adult stem cells working in conjunction with Dr. Shoa, cardiac surgeon and pioneer of the use of adult stem cells for heart disease. On December 6, 2005, Ho had his own blood- derived stem cells injected into his heart by Amit Patel and his fellow surgeons in Thailand. The treatment went without incident and it was reported that his heart would be boosted back to 75% capacity. Later in the month, Ho said, \\"I'm feeling much better and I'm so happy I came up here to do it.\\"Associated Press (December 9, 2005). Singer Don Ho says he's feeling better.

It was noted as one of the first \\"public monuments on one national territory, where the perception of another (nation) is shown in positive light\\". It was declared a cultural monument in 1965, and a cultural monument of great significance in 1983. Monument of Gratitude to France in Kalemegdan Park, Belgrade  History  = Origin = In the decisive days of the war after the epic battles of the Serbian Army, its perilous withdrawal across Albania and the almost inconceivable feat of breaching the enemy lines on the Salonika Front, a military alliance and friendship between two countries had been forged. After the war, Serbian intellectuals gathered around the Association of French Schools Alumni and the Society of Friends of France initiated erection, in Belgrade or Paris, of a monument to France, as a token of gratitude for her military and educational aid during and after the war, and of the friendship built in the days of greatest trials.Oдбранa Београда 1915. године Помен браниоцима Београда 1915. године, Политика, приступљено 14.10.2013. године, доступно на After the war, the Kingdom of Serbia ceased existing as such, becoming part of a newly created complex state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, subsequently Yugoslavia, and Belgrade, as its capital, saw a period of reconstruction and embellishment. On 17 December 1921 Belgrade City Council made the decision to erect a gratitude and honor memorial to the French soldiers who had lost their lives defending Belgrade in 1915. The French Schools Alumni and the Society of Friends of France started the official initiative in May 1924. In the summer of 1924 the Committee for Erecting a Monument chaired by Niko Miljanić, a physician, one of the founders of the Belgrade University School of Medicine, was set up. The Committee succeeded in raising considerable funds within a short span of time. = Location selection = Large amounts of money were raised because the original plan was for the monument to be built in Paris. The permission was asked from the Parisian Municipal Council, which granted the erection of the monument thanks to the mediation of , French ambassador to Belgrade. After the war, the Kingdom of Serbia ceased existing as such, becoming part of a newly created complex state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, subsequently Yugoslavia. However, French diplomacy preferred the monument to be built in the newly formed state, expecting that Yugoslavia will become a major exponent of French politics in this part of Europe. Dard was then ordered to convince the Serbian side to built the monument in Belgrade, and was successful. Historically, it was a \\"time when French influences became the domineering component of cultural, economic and political life in the capital of the newly formed Yugoslav state\\". King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and queen Maria at the inauguration of the monument In 1928, the City Council of Belgrade allocated a parcel of land in Kalemegdan, formerly possessed by the Army, for the monument: “in the most beautiful part of Kalemegdan Park, which commands one of the most beautiful European landscapes, and in the vicinity of which the home of France will be rising soon” (the French embassyЗграда Француског посланства, приступљено 14.10.2013. године, доступно на built in 1928–32). France responded to this gesture by setting up monuments to King Peter I the Liberator and King Alexander I the Unifier in Paris, memorials in Orleans and Marseilles, and by naming one of central Paris avenues after King Peter I of Serbia. These initiatives weren't state ones, though, but also initiated by various private organizations. Monuments to Serbian kings were built 6 years after the monument in Belgrade was dedicated. The chosen spot was a location of the former Karađorđe monument, and was recently cleared. The monument was set up in the vicinity of Karađorđe's Gate of the Fortress of Belgrade,Капије Београдске тврђаве on the former site of the monument to the leader of the First Serbian Resurrection against Ottoman rule, Karađorđe,Споменик Карађорђу erected by the Ministry of War in 1913, after the victories in the Balkan Wars, to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of a regular Serbian army by Karađorđe. In 1916 the occupying Austro-Hungarian force blew up the monument with dynamite in order to replace it with a colossal bronze statue of Franz Joseph. After the liberation of Belgrade, this statue was found on a Sava barge, melted down and reused for bells for Serbian Orthodox churches, the largest of which was donated to the church popularly known as Ružica,Црква Ружица in Kalemegdan. The initiative to erect a monument to Karađorđe launched in 1857 falls among the earliest activities relating to the practice of producing public monuments in Serbia. Meštrović's monument set up in its former place took advantage of the powerful symbolism of the fortress as a battlefield site and its remarkable location above the two rivers, overlooking the national and historical significance of the location originally intended for the memorial to Karađorđe. The final decision was confirmed in municipal council on 19 September 1930. = Making a monument = Reliefs \\"Sorbonne\\" and \\"Warriors\\" A special commission for choosing the project was formed by the council. The commission was chaired by one of the foremost academics in the state, Bogdan Popović. Popović was also a founder of the French literary society, as a former Parisian student. He was crucial in acquiring the job for a sculptor Ivan Meštrović. At the time, Popović was one of the staunchest defenders of another Meštrović's Belgrade project, publicly opposed the Pobednik monument. Meštrović worked on the concept and sketches for several months. He opted for the monumental form in the Art Deco style, quite popular at the time: a female figure with massive body, stepping out strongly, with a determinedly extended arm and proudly raised head. As ambassador Dard approved the initial design, Meštrović continued the work in the Artistic Academy in Zagreb, where he was a rector. He first made an alabaster model, followed by the three and a half long casting of the bronze monument, from 3 July to 20 October 1930. The ancient lost-wax casting method was used. The sculpture was cast in 14 pieces which were then composed in 2 and transported to Belgrade. They were connected in situ, on the Kalemegdan. Concurrently with the casting, another group of Meštrović's associates was working on the pedestal in Split. The two-stepped pedestal was made from the Brač marble. Two side reliefs were made by Meštrović's disciples Frano Kršinić and Antun Augustinčić, upon Meštrović's models. Kršinić carved the \\"Sorbonne\\" relief, while Augustinčić made the \\"Warriors\\". = Dedication = Parts of the stone pedestal and two parts of the bronze sculpture arrived in Belgrade in the late October 1930. The setting of the monument lasted for 8 days. The set date was 11 November 1930, the twelfth anniversary of the World War I ending. Two official delegations arrived from France a day earlier by train. One delegation represented French soldiers from the Salonica Front while the other was an official, government delegation, headed by minister Auguste Champetier de Ribes. The 11 November, a Peace Day, was declared a holiday and Belgrade was decorated with French and Yugoslav flags. Crowd of 20,000 gathered in Kalemegdan. Serbian side was represented by the highest officials, including King Alexander, Queen Maria, Prince Paul and Princess Olga. Serbian government was represented by minister Kosta Kumanudi. Bells of the nearby Cathedral Church were ringing, marking the occasion. Meštrović was absent. He claimed to being sick, but didn't notify the organizers. He notified French ambassador Dard instead. = 2018 reconstruction = Signs of damage to the monument were first discovered in 1963. In November 2017 it was announced that the monument would be revitalized in the second half of 2018. The revitalization was to be funded by both Serbia and France, as stated by the agreement signed by both governments on 25 April 2017. Corrosion had damaged the metal construction, while the stone pedestal had been damaged by atmospheric waters through the cracks on the slab joints. Especially endangered were the two side reliefs (\\"Sorbonne\\" and \\"Warriors\\"), while the figure itself had a big crack on its right foot which developed in the early 1990s due to the effect of the temperature difference on bronze. Though the project was finished in 2012, the lack of funding delayed the works. The monument was to be reopened on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. In April 2018 the sculpture was removed from the pedestal, and a temporary work room was constructed at the site of the monument in order for the revitalization to occur on the spot, instead of taking parts of the monument to another location. Sculptor Zoran Kuzmanović headed the refurbishment program which included the consolidation, restoration and conservation of the monument. During the removal of the statue, it was discovered that Meštrović, in order to secure the statue, poured 5 tons of concrete into the pedestal which also covered the lower part of the bronze statue. It is believed that this combination caused the pedestal to crack. The concrete had to be broken on top in order to free the sculpture so that it could be removed. Basreliefs on the sides of the pedestal, as well as the inscriptions A la France MCMXXX and We love France as she loved us 1914–1918 had to be carved again, this time in stone imported from Italy. The deadline had been set for 10 August 2018. During the reconstruction several discoveries were made. There were many cracks, up to long, in the lower section. Concrete partially filled the sculpture so it had to be precisely chiseled. The couplings, as the monument is made from several parts, weren't welded, but instead were riveted and fastened with the bolts. The quality of the bronze used was bad. Instead of having less than 5% of zinc, it contained 13-24%, meaning it had probably been obtained by the melting of cannon shells. The result of an error during the original casting, there are visible remains of over 50 holes on the cast, especially on the thigh section, which were originally filled with the bits of bronze and then forged in situ. It took 2 months to remove the soot from the outer side of the monument. Instead of concrete, the reconstructed monument, will be fastened with a construction built from stainless steel. The original Sorbonne and the Warriors bas-reliefs will be stored in the Museum of Belgrade, while the replicas, done by sculptor Goran Čpajak, will be placed on the monument instead. The sculpture was returned to its original place by August 10, and by September the area surrounding the pedestal was returned to its original, 1930s look.  Description  Great Kalemegdan The design of the monument was entrusted to the world renowned Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović, who made a model in his Zagreb studio (MeštrovićGalleryГалерија “Мештровић” у Загребу, приступљено 14.10.2013. године. Доступно на ). The sculpture was cast in fourteen pieces at the Art Foundry of the Academy of Fine Arts using the lost wax technique. The pieces were joined to form two halves of the vertically divided sculpture, transported to Belgrade and assembled together on the site. The monumental figure, over high, represents France rushing to Serbia's aid. The expressive movement of the allegorical female figure, an important motif in Meštrović's sculptural work, evokes and glorifies the national spirit of France, suggesting energy, leadership, courage and faith. Monumentality, typical of Meštrović's sculptural expression, is emphasized by mounting the massive form of the central female figure on a seven-metre-high pedestal made of blocks of Brač “marble” (in fact, grey Adriatic limestone turning white with time). The pyramidal structure of its geometric mass sets the rhythm of gradual increase in emphasis towards the central scene and ensures stylistic unity between the monument and the surrounding ground laid out in the geometric pattern of the French garden. By virtue of being located at the far end of the main alley that extends beyond the park borders and into the city's main street (Knez Mihailova), the monument becomes a significant visual landmark. Engraved on its front are the year of erection and the dedication “A la France”, and on the back, the inscription “We love France as she loved us 1914–1918”. The sides of the base of the pedestal feature narrative compositions in low relief at the eye level of the viewer. The reliefs were executed after Meštrović's drawings by the sculptors Frano Kršinić, who oversaw the work, and Antun Augustinčić, as well as Grga Antunac, Šime Dujmić and Orlandini. Without encroaching into the surrounding space, the reliefs form an organic part of the pedestal, with the carved sections fitted with precision, while leaving the joints visible in the spirit of Egyptian monumentalized relief. The repetitive row of figures in the scene known as Warriors on the left side follows the principle of isocephaly on the model of the bas-relief depicting Assyrian archers, a motif Meštrović elaborated in relief and lithography. It evokes the bond forged by Serbian and French soldiers on the Salonika Front. On the opposite side, the more softly modelled allegory of the Sorbonne alludes to the French educational aid extended to Serbian youths during and after the war. The original sketch for this relief, depicting France as a woman breastfeeding Serbian children (now kept at Meštrović Gallery), was altered at the suggestion of the Director of the French Institute in Zagreb (Raymond Warnier). After the revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy, the female figure of Marianne, national symbol of the triumph of French republicanism, found expression in many works of art: she is shown as a leader singing the Marseillaise in Francois Rude's Departure of VolunteersПолазак добровољаца, Франсоа Рид, приступљено 14.10.2013. године.

These and similar allegorical depictions of France as a determined female figure with the characteristic Phrygian bonnet are clear historical references of relevance for Meštrović's conception of the monument in Kalemegdan. The manner of formal stylization and the force of movement bring the figure close to the Sezession style. The logic of its vigorous forward motion, which can be traced back to late Hellenistic sculpture, is based on placing the entire weight of the figure on the left foot and establishing static equilibrium between dominant planes: between twisted masses of the upper body with the jutting right shoulder and the long taut arc of the right leg, and the cumulative mass of the drapery and left arm. The arrangement of the main planes and the lateral location of reliefs shift the beholder's viewpoint to the sides of the monument. Even though the side aspect is visually richer, Meštrović established the (ideal) frontal viewpoint in order to emphasize the dignity and importance of the central figure. A shift away from naturalism and elements of modern inspiration are most readily observable in the treatment of drapery, which assumes a fantastic shape which, viewed from the rear, makes the figure almost unrecognizable. The fusion of the left arm with the drapery serves to produce an almost aerodynamic form, with the horizontal lineation of the drapery folds suggesting the force of movement which almost lifts the figure into the air. The use of the drapery folds suggests the author's idea to evocation of wings, thereby coming closer to the ideal of victory, the famous late Hellenistic winged Nike of Samothrace. The central bronze figure is tall, wide and weights 4 tons. It is situated on the pedestal. The pedestal itself is made of the full blocks of the Brač rocks layered over the concrete core.  Importance  The Monument of Gratitude to France belongs to the post-World War I phase of Meštrović's oeuvre which produced the largest number of his monumental works marked by a lessening concern with detail and the emphasis on the underlying idea. The monument introduced expressiveness instead of the hitherto usual realistic and narrative concept, contributing to the evolution of public monuments in Belgrade. Based on its cultural and historical value, it was designated a cultural monument in 1965, and a cultural monument of great significance in 1983 (“Sl. glasnik RS”, no. 28/83).  Controversies  = 1999 = In March 1999, France joined the NATO attack on Serbia. As a consequence, a group of young citizens covered the monument with black cloth and placed a writing \\"May there be eternal glory to the France that doesn't exist anymore\\". By 2010, some of the historians concluded that the 1930 legacy has passed and that the only thing that remained to memorialize the great friendship between France and Serbia are the monuments. = 2018 = During the World War I centenary celebration in November 2018 in Paris, the sitting schedule cause a major controversy in Serbia. As Serbian army had a pivotal role in forcing out of the war both Bulgaria and Austro-Hungary, the most extensive casualties compared to the population number and historical friendship with France, placing of Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić away from the central seats and placing there representatives of the states which were on the opposing side in the war or didn't even exist as separate states at the time, was taken as an insult in Serbia. A day later, the recently renovated monument was vandalized, with the black X marks sprayed over the writings on the monument. The lower section was wrapped in plastic sheets, but the graffiti were cleaned soon and the plastic was removed. Members of the city communal police patrolled the area for a few days. French ambassador to Serbia, Frédéric Mondoloni, publicly apologized on TV for the sitting schedule, but even the suggestions of renaming the streets named after France and Paris appeared in public.

She was the first woman elected to the British Honduras Legislative Assembly (now the Belize House of Representatives) and the first woman to serve as a government minister in British Honduras, now Belize. Biography Gwendolyn Margaret Smith was born on 11 July 1901 to Sidney Smith and Guadalupe Baeza in Maskall Village, British Honduras. She attended Mr. Datsun Primary School, St. Mary's Primary School and St. Catherine's Academy. In 1926, she married the photographer Victor Manuel Lizarraga and they subsequently had five children. Lizarraga was a businesswoman, who operated a successful chicle and mahogany farm. As she conducted her business inspecting the chicle and mahogany camps, Lizarraga ignored convention, driving a land rover, wearing pants, carrying a gun, and smoking cigarettes. She was very outspoken and authoritative, and not intimidated in her dealings with big companies such as Wrigley’s, Castillo and Thurton. She was also known as a compassionate employer and one who supported equal pay for equal work. In 1943, when the British Honduran Trade Union (BHTU) was forming, Lizarraga was an invited speaker to an April meeting. She urged inclusion of protections for women laborers and equal wages and while the male participants agreed with her at her speech, when they voted on their minimum wage standards in June of that year, women were excluded. Beginning in the 1950s, Lizarraga worked in several areas to promote women's rights. In 1953, she was hired as a female parole officerMacpherson (2007), p. 191 for the Social Development Department. In 1954, she began organizing women politically throughout the country beginning in her home area of Maskall Village. From there she traveled north to Orange Walk Town, and then to Sand Hill, Benque Viejo and finally to the far southern, Punta Gorda. In 1959, she formed the United Women’s Group (UWG) with 900 women from throughout the country, with the goals of empowering women culturally, economically, and politically. To that end, she co-founded the United Women’s Credit Union, encouraging women save, \\"even if they could only afford $0.25 per week\\". Recognizing that only landowners were eligible voters in British Honduras at that time, Madam Liz made special efforts to help women acquire property. She took women from the UWG to the Lands Department to obtain land grants, but they were was told there was no land available. Marching into the swamps, Lizarraga surveyed and created a map of parcels for the women. She then took it back to the Lands Department for recording. These women's parcels are located in what is today the Collet Constituency between Curassow, Elston Kerr and Gibnut Streets, bounded by North Creek. Similarly when children were denied access to education because there was no money to prepare the site and construct a school in their poor and working-class neighborhood, Madam Liz and the UWG women began clearing the mangroves from the swamps with two-man handsaws. Workers from the Publics Works Department later joined the women and the result was two new schools—Belize Junior Secondary Schools N° 1 and N° 2—were completed, which were later renamed Edward P. Yorke School and Gwen Lizarraga High School. 1961 marked the first year that women were allowed to run in the country's national elections. In April, Gwendolyn Lizarraga became the first woman elected to the National Assembly of British Honduras. She won the Pickstock division with 69% of the votes. Subsequently, she was appointed as Minister of Education, Housing and Social Services, making her the first female Minister in the country, as well. She was reelected in 1965 and 1969, both times also being reappointed as Minister of Education, Housing and Social Services. In 1969, she spearheaded a project to build low-cost housing in the neighborhoods of King’s Park, Lake Independence and Queen’s Square. Lizarraga staunchly opposed granting casino concessions in the country and spoke out about her concerns. Lizarraga was not a candidate for reelection in 1974, leaving office shortly before her final illness. She was succeeded in the Pickstock seat by her son, Adolfo.\\"Francisco Adolfo Lizarraga\\", Mothe Funeral Homes LLC. (accessed 7 September 2015) In addition to her public life, Lizarraga was a chess player and helped organize the first chess club in the country. She also collected folklore and was a choreographer, instrumental in the revival of the Mestizada dances. She died 9 June 1975 and was buried in Lord's Ridge Cemetery in Belize City. Legacy Lizarraga has been honored by several posthumous memorials. The Gwendolyn Lizarraga High School was named in her honor and offers both secondary education and tertiary classes in a program held in conjunction with the University of Belize. Several streets throughout the country are named for her, like Madam Liz Avenue and Gwen Lizarraga Street. In 1992, as part of a commemorative series, a postage stamp was issued with her photograph. The \\"Madam Liz\\" Award is granted annually by the Belize Women’s Political Caucus to the woman whose work has been exemplary in improving the situation of Belizean women and children.

He is the series' strongman and well known for his physically impossible powers that often make him the deus ex machina who solves every problem. Jerom's popularity with readers is so huge that he inspired at least two spin-off series: Jerom de Gouden Stuntman (1962–1991) and J. ROM - Force of Gold (2014). In the earliest Dutch translations Jerom's name was changed into \\"Jeroen\\". This was changed back to Jerom when the entire series was translated into Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands. In the English translations he has been named Wilbur, Jerome, or Jethro. Debut Jerom was introduced in the album De Dolle Musketiers (\\"The Zany Musketeers\\"; 1953). In this story Suske, Wiske, Lambik and Aunt Sidonia time travel to the 17th century where they work as musketeers for the French king. They have to fight against a French duke, Le Handru, who used a super strong thawed caveman, Jerom, as his secret weapon. At first the cast is powerless against him, but later Wiske is able to make Jerom their ally instead. Together they defeat Le Handru and at the end of the story Jerom travels back to 1953 with them. Jerom's original appearance was inspired by the caveman Alley Oop by V.T. Hamlin. His name was inspired by Belgian playwright Jeroom Verten (1909–1958).VAN HOOYDONCK, Peter, Willy Vandersteen: De Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal, Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1994 Character When Jerom was first introduced in the series he was merely a dumb brute from the Stone Age. By order of duke Le Handru he beats up everyone without mercy. The only thing that can tame him is anise, which the duke frequently feeds him with. Wiske discovers that Jerom also has a softer side when he plays with her doll, Schanulleke, and is scared that she will die because she refuses to eat. Wiske makes her doll \\"eat\\" by drinking the milk Jerom prepared herself when he is not looking. This convinces Jerom that Wiske is nice and he is motivated to join their side instead, even travelling back to the 20th century with them, thus becoming the final main cast member of the series. He moved in at Lambik's place, despite the fact they often bicker about. In the first albums Jerom behaves and dresses like an uncivilized caveman. In De Knokkersburcht (\\"The Knokkers Fortress\\") (1953) he even literally behaves like a dog. After a few albums he gradually acts more polite towards others and starts to dress in modern 20th century suits. First by wearing a tie above his animal skin in De Tam Tam Kloppers (\\"The Tam Tam Beaters\\"; 1953), then gradually wearing sweaters, shirts, jeans and shoes. Jerom even obeys his own ethics. He only fights for just causes and helps everybody, even opponents, when they are in danger.In \\"Het Sprekende Testament\\" (\\"The Talking Testament\\"; 1957) Jerom secretly helps the Talking Cat during a car race, despite being his major rival, because he fears for his opponents' life. He can't be bribed and never betrays his friends, contrary to someone like Lambik. Jerom also never fights animals and tries to control his powers. Only when he is put under a magic spell, hypnotized or drugged with chloroform Jerom joins the antagonists. Jerom is usually calm and level headed. When other people around him act aggressive or showcase other heavy emotions Jerom always remains restrained and master of the situation. He always talks in a telegram style and shortens Lambik's name as \\"Bik\\". Because of his brutish appearance and simplistic way of speaking other people, even his friends, often underestimate his intelligence. They treat him like a child or a simple minded person. Sidonia often uses Jerom to do difficult or tedious tasks for her, like cleaning the dishes. This behaviour is not entirely unjustified, seeing that Jerom is often not familiar with certain modern phenomena and needs to be explained about them. Despite being far more civilized than he was when he first appeared in the series Jerom still doesn't always feel at ease in modern society. In De Malle Mergpijp (\\"The Silly Marrowbone\\"; 1973) he even goes through an identity crisis and briefly returns to his prehistoric ways. Relation with other characters Jerom lives at Lambik's home, where he acts as a sidekick to Lambik's antics. They are often each other's rivals, like in De Zwarte Zwaan (\\"The Black Swan\\"; 1958), where they both try to be the first to publish journalistic scoops. Sometimes they both fall in love with an attractive female and try to dispose of one another in becoming her partner.Tedere Tronica (\\"Tender Tronica\\"), Standaard Uitgeverij, 1968. But when they both have a common social cause to fight for they are a firm, close-knit duo, for instance animal abuse,De Straatridder (\\"The Street Knight\\"; 1956), Standaard Uitgeverij. social apathy De Vlijtige Vlinder (\\"The Diligent Butterfly\\"; 1977), Standaard Uitgeverij\\" and dictatorship.De Krimson Crisis (\\"The Krimson Crisis\\"; 1988), Standaard Uitgeverij Jerom also has a special bond with Wiske, who was the first to discover his soft spot. Many women have fallen in love with Jerom over the course of the series, but something always happens that prevents him from effectively marrying her. Either he is not interested in them or they turn out to be villains. Strength Jerom's main personality trait is his supernatural strength. He calls himself \\"de sterkste man van het westelijk halfrond, andere helft ook (\\"the strongest man of the western hemisphere,and the other half too\\"). He is able to defeat large groups of people and monsters and can move or destroy buildings with one finger. His eyes are able to produce light and can look through concrete objects. When making contact with electric utensils Jerom is able to produce energyDe Knokkersburcht (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij. and when he drinks gasoline he can run at car speed.De Tamtam Kloppers (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij. He swims across oceans, can drill himself through the ground De Dulle Griet (1966), Standaard Uitgeverij jump over buildings and even into the clouds.De Efteling Elfjes, Standaard Uitgeverij, 1977 His chest is also able to resist bullets, which just bounce off from it.De Speelgoedzaaier (1954), Standaard Uitgeverij. Despite this ability he is still held in control by someone with a gun in some stories. Jerom is also known for his \\"T-slag (\\"T-blow\\"), which is a type of strike where his opponent is hit, but only falls down knocked out a few seconds later because his brains only realized it then.The first appearance of this power occurs in Wattman (1966–1967), Standaard Uitgeverij. Jerom can also run faster than soundDe Knokkersburcht (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij. and even change his own speech balloons into parachutes, if necessary.De Tamtam Kloppers (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij When he is about to fight extremely violent he deliberately makes a huge dust cloud, asks the readers beforehand to close their eyes or lets the artists cover up the panels with a large curtain.Happens in De Tootootjes (1992), Standaard Uitgeverij, for instance. His efforts seldom tire him. In De Wilde Weldoener (\\"The Wild Well-Doer\\"; 1961) he reveals that his eyes always remain shut because \\"his eyelids are too heavy\\". So he just peers underneath them.De Wilde Weldoener (1961), Standaard Uitgeverij. Sometimes he even tries to spare his powers by using only one fist or not actually hitting someone. He just uses makes a feint arm movement and the wind he produces is enough to blow his opponent away. Only when Jerom hasn't eaten yet he tends to feel weaker than usual.This happens in Het Mini- Mierennest (1967) and Het Bretoense Broertje (1982), for instance, both published by Standaard Uitgeverij His appetite is so large that he eats alarm clocks,De Knokkersburcht (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij. drinks a whole bucket full of beer De IJzeren Schelvis (1954–1955), Standaard Uitgeverij. or even an entire mountain lake De Flierende Fluiter (2004–2005), Standaard Uitgeverij. Jerom is in fact so undefeatable that the series' writers often have trouble making the stories interesting, since Jerom can always be used as a deus ex machina to solve all problems. Therefore, he is sometimes sent away on holiday or for work at the start of a story. Halfway the plot he is often temporarily eliminated by poison, hypnosis, magic or a sleeping potion, only to make a triumphant return in the end. Family background and biography Jerom was born in the Stone Age. He owes his enormous power to a shaman who drew a cave painting of a strong man, then, with aid of a marrow bone, blew a magical powder on the drawing to bring him to life. Jerom's mother is Moe Mie. His father died in a fight with other caveman.De Malle Mergpijp (\\"The Silly Marrow Bone\\") (1973), Standaard Uitgeverij. Jerom also has an uncle.De Primitieve Paljassen (\\"The Primitive Fools\\"; 2006), Standaard Uitgeverij. At a certain point Jerom was frozen in ice and only thawed in the 17th century by French duke Le Handru, who used him as a secret weapon. Suske, Wiske, Lambik and Aunt Sidonia were able to make Jerom a \\"good\\" person and made him travel along with them to the 20th century.De Dolle Musketiers (\\"The Zany Musketeers\\") (1953), Standaard Uitgeverij. However, in De Nerveuze Nerviërs (\\"The Nervous Nervii\\"; 1967) professor Barabas makes the contradictory claim that Jerom descended from ancient Gauls. According to him he owns his strength to the power and will power of his ancestors. In later stories this origin story is abandoned in favor of the theory that Jerom was born in prehistoric times. (Sparky Comic 1968 & 1969) Spin-offs In 1962 Jerom received his own spin-off series, Jerom de Gouden Stuntman (\\"Jerom the Golden Stuntman\\"). In this series he is teamed up with Tante Sidonia and Professor Barabas. Other main cast members from Suske en Wiske are absent. The series could be described as a humoristic super hero comic in which Jerom wears a golden suit with cape and drives a flying motorcycle. A new cast member was created for this series: Odilon, a clumsy sidekick assistant. The series were translated in French (as Jérôme\\"), Greek (Zerom) and German (Wastl). Especially in Germany the albums sold well. At a certain point they were even published in Germany first before they appeared in Dutch. The production tempo was so high that a new Jerom story appeared every week, causing the quality to drop considerably. As a result, many albums weren't even translated into Dutch anymore. In 1982, after 95 albums, the Gouden Stuntman series was terminated. Jerom continued under a new title, De Wonderbare Reizen van Jerom (\\"The Wonderful Travels of Jerom\\"), but by 1991 this series was also discontinued due to underwhelming sales. Only 36 titles of this series were made. In 2014 a new spin-off series was created around Jerom: J.ROM - Force of Gold, drawn by Dutch artist Romano Molenaar, best known for continuing Storm after Don Lawrence's death in 2002, and written by Bruno De Roover. This spin-off is drawn more realistically in an American superhero comic style, inspired by the work of Frank Miller. Five albums have been released before it was discontinued. Jerom also appeared as \\"Big Billy Bigg\\" in a series of adventures in U.K comic \\"Sparky\\" between February 1968 and September 1969. Popularity Together with Lambik and Wiske Jerom is the most popular character of Suske en Wiske. He plays a central role in stories like De Circusbaron (\\"The Circus Baron\\"; 1954), Jeromba de Griek (\\"Jeromba the Greek\\"; 1965), De Malle Mergpijp (\\"The Silly Marrow Bone\\"; 1973), De Toffe Tamboer (\\"The Pleasing Drummer\\"; 1981), and De Slimme Slapjanus (\\"The Smart Weakling\\"; 1993). Originally, when he was still a caveman, his grotesque appearance repulsed newspaper readers. Vandersteen remembered that he received complaints from readers that \\"their breakfast no longer tasted well after seeing Jerom in the comics section\\".VAN HOOYDONCK, Peter, Willy Vandersteen: De Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal, Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1994 After the character gradually started dressing more civilized most readers liked him a lot better. Still, there are some fans who believe that Jerom made the series more formulaic because he can be used to solve every problem.VAN HOOYDONCK, Peter, Willy Vandersteen: De Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal, Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1994 In popular culture In the 1960s a game was created around Jerom called Op-Jerommeke\\".

It details the story of Reggie Shaw, a Mormon teenager who killed two scientists in Utah in 2006 while he was texting and driving. Richtel also reports scientific studies on human attention interspersed with the narrative. Background A Deadly Wandering is based on a series of articles in The New York Times that Richtel wrote in 2010, garnering him a Pulitzer Prize. His 2011 novel Devil's Plaything dealt with themes of personal technology and its sometimes harmful impact on society. Synopsis One morning in September 2006, shortly after being denied a Mormon mission due to premarital sex, nineteen-year-old Utah college student Reggie Shaw is texting and driving with his girlfriend when he crosses the yellow lines on the highway. He hits and kills James Furfaro and Keith O’Dell, two rocket scientists headed to work. Unharmed, Shaw attempts to call 911 but the call didn't go through. A state trooper that comes to the scene said he witnessed “a collision so violent it popped out the passengers’ eyeballs.” Despite initially denying he was texting and driving, and his parents vehemently standing behind him, Shaw eventually admits to it when faced with damning evidence. Richtel examines the police investigation and Shaw's prosecution, which was a test case in terms of accident litigation. Shaw ended up serving several weeks in prison for negligent homicide. Richtel intersperses this narrative with scientific studies of attention and the human mind. He details the history of cognitive neuroscience, from its beginnings in World War II in assisting pilots to not become overwhelmed by technology, to its current applications with MRI studies. Richtel cites a study that claims motorists are impaired for 15 seconds after they text. He explains how cell phone companies initially denied texting and driving was a dangerous activity. Indeed, Richtel notes, not a single state banned the practice when the accident occurred. Eventually, Reggie Shaw becomes a prominent advocate against distracted driving. He is forgiven by the families of the scientists he killed. Reception Robert Kolker of The New York Times gave the book a positive review. He wrote, \\"As an instructive social parable, Richtel’s densely reported, at times forced yet compassionate and persuasive book deserves a spot next to “Fast Food Nation” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” in America’s high school curriculums. To say it may save lives is self-evident.\\" Kolker notes that, \\"The most powerful question raised by “A Deadly Wandering” is a simple one: If we know texting and driving is so bad for us, why do we still do it?\\" The Christian Science Monitor said that the book is a \\"keen and elegantly raw – like a tooth- crackingly crisp photograph that bleeds at the edges – story surrounding this disaster is not just a morality tale about texting and driving, but also a probe sent into the world of technology, examining the way it is outstripping our capability to keep up with it, and how we as a culture are feeding bullets into the techno-gun and playing with it.\\" Daniel Dyer of The Plain Dealer liked how Richtel changed narrative focus \\"to keep us continually apprised of the actions of his various principals and supporting players.\\" References Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Books by Matt Richtel Category:Psychology books Category:HarperCollins books ","title":"A Deadly Wandering"},{"id":"47720694","text":"Nightcliff Dragons Rugby League Club is an Australian rugby league football club based in Nightcliff, Northern Territory formed in 1961.http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/jspui/bitstream/10070/241719/37/ntn29jul12037x.pdf They conduct teams for both junior and senior teams.Run preseason Academies for both youth boys and youth girls Notable Juniors *Gerry De La Cruz (1982 Canberra Raiders) *Duncan MacGillivray (1996-03 South Sydney Rabbitohs & Penrith) *Joel Romelo (2009-14 Canterbury Bulldogs, Melbourne Storm & Penrith Panthers) *Sam Irwin (2013-14 Gold Coast Titans) *Chris Smith (2015- Penrith Panthers & Sydney Roosters) *Abel Shirley See also References External links *Nightcliff Dragons Fox Sports pulse * Category:Rugby clubs established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in Australia Category:Sport in Darwin, Northern Territory Category:Rugby league teams in the Northern Territory ","title":"Nightcliff Dragons"},{"id":"47720697","text":"Knowledge by presence (Persian:علم حضوری) or consciousness is a degree and kind of primordial knowledge in the Illuminationist school of Islamic philosophy.

According to this theory self knows himself directly through a kind of cognition.  Concept  Humans in their ordinary experience show themselves as the primary subject of knowledge. Humans communicated with non-humans with different methods such as mind, language and reason. In any kind of knowledge and before any knowledge, always there is a kind of knowledge called knowledge of oneself or consciousness. This consciousness is foremost and prior to any knowledge. According to Mehdi Haeri Yazdi, the knowledge by presence is a sort of knowledge which has all relations within its paradigm. In this kind of knowledge there is a self- object relation without the interference of a connection with an external object. In this kind of knowledge, the sense of knowledge is equal with the self. In the sphere of the self, both to exist and to know are identical. The fact of knowledge by presence is not identical with conceptualism and representation. Although this kind of knowledge is expressed by proposition, but is not as the same as knowledge by concept. Knowledge by presence has characters such as being personal, non-transferable, admitting different levels and development. In knowledge by presence, the object is present to the subject.  Historical background  Al Farabi is known for his famous Doctrine, namely harmonization of opinions of Aristotle and Plato. On the one hand Al-Farabi believes that Aristotle rejected Plato's Forms, but Aristotle himself, on the other hand, had difficulty with divine forms. Avicenna developed the notion of knowledge by presence in the argument of the floating man. According to this argument, if we consider the I-ness of a human in absolutely empty air, then the only thing to conceive is the selfness of a human without any material faculties. On one hand Surevardi criticized Avicenna's theory of knowledge which is based on the important roles of definitions. On the other hand Suhrevardi introduced innate knowledge in which awareness and consciousness are basic. According to Suhrevardi, knowledge by presence encompasses the conception of a thing, which is along with assent to it. According to Suhrevardi's theory of knowledge, the true knowledge is achieved not by concepts but through a direct knowledge of things divine. Illuminationist philosophers know the knowledge of two kinds, of which knowledge by presence is one of them. Knowledge by presence is of a nonrepresentational, immediate character along with no reference to external objects. According to Suhrevardi, the \\"self\\" could know itself just by virtue of its presence. It also knows consciousness beyond the distinction of the subject and object division in epistemology. According to Suhrevardi, it is also described by self-objectivity, namely the nature of this knowledge is to the reality of awareness and in this knowledge the self is aware it is existentially one and the same thing. Therefore, the self and consciousness of the self are individually and numerically one thing. Surevardi also pointed out that all knowledge is returned to knowledge by presence. In other words in representational knowledge the presence of an image in the mind in turn is a kind of knowledge by presence.  Characteristics  There are many characters for knowledge by presence, including: * There are no differences between subjective and objective objects, namely both of them are the same. * Knowledge by presence is free from dualism, and falsity and truth. * This kind of knowledge belongs to the sphere of being and therefore has nothing to do with conceptualization and representation.

Ancestry He was the son of Robert Marmion, 3rd Baron Marmion of Tamworth, and his second wife Philippa. Career and life During the First Barons' War a group of rebellious barons, supported by Prince Louis of France, made war on King John of England due to his cruel and inept leadership. Although John signed the Magna Carta on 15 June 1215, war broke out in England. William Marmion's elder brother, Robert Marmion the elder, was one of the rebel barons (as was their father) and on 25 February 1216 the King sent William to see if he could persuade him to make peace with the King again. John died on 18 October 1216 and was succeeded by his nine-year-old son Henry who, not being despised by the barons, attempted to calm things down. On 15 May 1218 Henry confirmed William's lordship of the manor of Torrington, Lincolnshire, and 10 librates (£10 worth of land) in Berwick, Sussex, which his father had previously given him by charter. Distrust between the barons and Henry remained though and in 1222 the king ordered the Sheriff of Lincolnshire to seize the lands of William Marmion, Cleric, at Torrington and to value them, as Henry had been informed that William had left England without licence to join his rival King Louis. It was not until December 1235 that William reappeared and petitioned the king to give him back his lands, claiming that he not been in France at all. William was forgiven and reunited with Torrington after making a payment of £20. William was presented to the church of Coningsby c. 1236 and acted as guardian to his nephew Philip Marmion, 5th Baron Marmion of Tamworth, during his minority. According to Palmer, William later became Dean of the collegiate church of Tamworth. William's father had founded the Abbey of Barbery and in 1238 William gave it land for the \\"souls of his mother and father and his brother Robert junior\\". His seal attached to the deed consists of an angel, erect and holding a censer, with the words \\"William Marmion, cleric\\" written underneath. As the long reign of King Henry III progressed he increased taxation and, when combined with the famine of the time, caused the barons to rise up in arms again in the Second Barons' War. The barons were led by Simon de Montfort and after he had defeated Henry III at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264, he held a Parliament at Westminster Palace. Large numbers of clergy and burgesses were invited to attend for the first time in the hope that de Montford would recruit more support for his rebellion, as most of the barons had already chosen sides or been killed in the war. The aged William Marmion was one of the clergy chosen and was summoned by writ on 24 December 1264. Family and descendants Marmion is not known to have married or had issue, nor is it likely as he would have taken a vow of celibacy when he took holy orders. During the mid-13th century there are records of a \\"William son of William Marmion\\" in Lincolnshire but he is perhaps more likely to have been a junior son of William Marmion or a more distantly related junior Marmion line.

The idea of the completely women-run fair was to display the progress of ideas, work, and products of twentieth-century women.  Description  The first Women's World's Fair was held April 18–25 of 1925 in Chicago at the American Furniture Mart Building and officially opened by First Lady Grace Coolidge. The eight-day fair was the idea of Helen Bennett and Ruth Hanna McCormick. It was run entirely by women and consisted of 280 booths representing some seventy women occupations. The fair drew about 200,000 visitors, earning a net of some $50,000. The fair's purpose was to display women's ideas, work, and products for the twentieth century. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition there had been a Women's Pavilion funded and organized by women and in particular Elizabeth Duane Gillespie. The building was over and it was in the shape of a Maltese cross.Women's pavilion, The Centennial Exposition, Page 116, Retrieved 11 September 2015 The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 demonstrated some women's handicrafts in a sewing exhibit, but this fair was to show the progress women had made in seventy industries since then. A side benefit of the fair was that it raised money for the women's Republican Party organizations. The exhibits showed women's accomplishments in the arts, literature, science, and industry. These exhibits were also an inspiration to young women in their new careers. One of the exhibitors was Illinois Bell Telephone Company. Others were newspapers, manufacturers, hospitals, banks, and retail stores. Many local enterprises had employment opportunities. Women lawyers, inventors, and artists had booths demonstrating women's contributions in these fields. As an example, American sculptor Harriet Whitney Frishmuth was represented by her 1920 bronze work Joy of the Waters. Women's organizations were represented by the Women's Trade Union League, Business and Professional Women's Club, the Visiting Nurse Association, the YWCA, Hull House, the Illinois Club for Catholic Women, and the Auxiliary House of the Good Shepherd.  Speeches  A group of about one thousand women from Sycamore, Illinois, on April 23 had breakfast with famous women. An all woman's orchestra furnished music. The speakers were women of notoriety which included women authors, business women, and various women artisans. The speeches were limited to five minutes. The main speaker was Nellie Tayloe Ross, the only state governor there. Another speaker was the collector of internal revenue of Chicago. Another was the secretary of the Cabinet Department of Commerce for President Herbert Hoover. The medical profession was represented by Dr. Alice Hamilton of Harvard University. The legal profession was represented by Judge Kathryn Sellers of Washington, D.C.  Program  Whiting Hall was visited by the women after the speeches. The booths where artistically decorated showing some of a hundred or so different occupations in which women were employed. Some of these were antique needlework, pottery, silver fox farming, and goat breeding. Examples that received special attention were nurses and welfare workers. A key note was emphasis on earnestness, punctuality and thoroughness in whatever line of work was undertaken. A unique feature of the first Woman's World's Fair was a daily program. There was a particular topic for each day. Besides being instructive it was entertaining. Music and dancing were especially emphasized each day. Bennett was the general director of the fair. The woman's fair was a success and held for three additional years.  References   Sources    External links  *Woman's World Fair Souvenir Program - Chicago Historical Society.

Typically, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have a history of acute myocardial infarction, however, it may occur in patients with coronary artery disease, but without a past history of acute myocardial infarction. This cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death. The adjective ischemic means characteristic of, or accompanied by, ischemia — local anemia due to mechanical obstruction of the blood supply. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of ischemic cardiomyopathy include sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and palpitations. Cause Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the cause of more than 60% of all cases of systolic congestive heart failure in most countries of the world. A chest radiograph that demonstrates coronary artery calcification is a probable indication of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The following are causes of ischemic cardiomyopathy: * Diabetes * Atherosclerosis * Vasospasm * Inflammation of arteries Pathophysiology Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by too little blood flow and hence oxygen reaching the muscular layer of the heart due to a narrowing of coronary arteries in turn causing cell death. This can cause different levels of tissue injury and affect large and intermediate arteries alike. Diagnosis Ischemic cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol, imaging both global and regional function. Also the Look-Locker technique is used to identify diffuse fibrosis; it is therefore important to be able to determine the extent of the ischemic scar. Some argue that only left main- or proximal-left anterior descending artery disease is relevant to the diagnostic criteria for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial imaging usually demonstrates left ventricular dilation, severe ventricular dysfunction, and multiple infarctions. Signs include congestive heart failure, angina edema, weight gain and fainting, among others. Management Cardiac-Stem-Cells Restoring adequate blood flow to the heart muscle in people with heart failure and significant coronary artery disease is strongly associated with improved survival, some research showing up to 75% survival rates over 5 years. A stem cell study indicated that using autologous cardiac stem cells as a regenerative approach for the human heart (after a heart attack) has great potential. American Heart Association practice guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) use in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy (40 days post-MI) that are (NYHA) New York Heart Association functional class I. A LVEF measurement (simply called LVEF alone among cardiologists) of greater than (>) 30% is often used to differentiate primary from ischemic cardiomyopathy, and as a prognostic indicator. Coronary artery bypass surgery A 2004 study showed the patients in that study who underwent ventricular restoration as well as a coronary artery bypass achieved greater postoperative LVEF than with the latter surgery alone. Severe cases are treated with heart transplantation. =Prognosis= One of the most important features differentiating ischemic cardiomyopathy from the other forms of cardiomyopathy is the shortened, or worsened all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. According to several studies, coronary artery bypass graft surgery has a survival advantage over medical therapy (for ischemic cardiomyopathy) across varied follow-ups.

Response System Capabilities  The consortium’s response system builds on the equipment proven effective in the containment of the Deepwater Horizon blowout, including the Helix Fast Response System with the Q4000 intervention vessel and Helix Producer 1 from Helix Energy Solutions Group. HWCG’s core equipment includes two dual-ram capping stacks capable of operating in water depths through 10,000 feet. These capping stacks can effectively shut-in and contain a subsea well. If a flow and capture is required, the system is capable of a process volume of 130,000 barrels of oily fluids per day and 220 million cubic feet of gas per day. HWCG maintains contracts and operating agreements with over thirty service providers to leverage additional expertise, assistance and equipment. This integrated response solution yielded a tested deployment response time of less than seven days to cap a deepwater well, compared to the nearly 90 days needed to contain the Deepwater Horizon blowout. HWCG continues to run annual subsea incident response drills and collaborates with members, service sector companies and regulators in order to continually test and improve its response plan.  Members  HWCG currently supports seventeen member companies: Deep Gulf Energy LP, ENI US Operating Company Inc., EnVen Energy Ventures, LLC, Energy Resource Technology GOM, Inc., LLOG Exploration Company, LLC, Marubeni Oil & Gas (USA) Inc., Murphy Exploration & Production Company (USA), Noble Energy Services, Inc., Petrobras USA Inc., Red Willow Offshore, LLC, Repsol Services Company, Ridgewood Energy WCG Member, LLC, Talos ERT, Talos Petroleum LLC, TOTAL E&P; USA, INC, Walter Oil & Gas Corporation and W&T; Offshore, Inc.

Named after a Scottish grouse moor, he was a specialist sprinter who was usually held up for a late run. His early form was promising but unremarkable as he won two minor races from seven starts in his first two seasons. As a four-year-old in 2002 he showed exceptional improvement and established himself as arguably the best sprinter in Europe. He won four races of increasing importance including the Palace House Stakes and the Temple Stakes before recording his biggest win in the Nunthorpe Stakes. He sustained an injury in the last-named race and was retired from racing shortly afterwards. He later became a very successful sire: his progeny have included the Cartier Champion Sprinter Sole Power. Background Kyllachy is a bay horse with a small white star standing 16 hands high, bred by the Berkshire-based Wheelersland Stud. He was a powerful, heavily built individual: one of his jockeys said that \\"if you let the horse out in a field of bullocks you wouldn't know the difference.\\" His sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Farhh and Excellent Art. Kyllachy's dam Pretty Poppy won one minor race from thirteen attempts in 1990 and 1991. Her female-line ancestry made her a distant relative of the outstanding racemare Swiss Maid. As a yearling the colt was sent to the St Leger Sale at Doncaster in September 1999 and was bought for 36,000 guineas by Will Edmeades, a bloodstock agent whose other purchases have included Sir Percy and Presvis. Edmeades was acting on behalf of Thurloe Thoroughbreds, a group of syndicates formed in 1995 by established in 1995 by James Stafford whilst the under-bidder at the auction was the trainer Henry Candy who was acting on behalf of Peter Deal. After some negotiation Deal joined the syndicate and Candy trained the horse at Kingstone Warren in Oxfordshire. Candy had enjoyed great success with middle-distance performers such as Time Charter and Master Willie in the 1980s but had struggled for winners in the 1990s before re-emerging as a trainer of sprinters. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Kyllachy began his racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Chepstow Racecourse on 10 August. Ridden as in most of his early races by Chris Rutter, he recovered from being hampered at half way to take the lead in the final furlong and won by a neck from Attorney. The colt then started 11/8 favourite for a minor race on heavy ground at Beverley Racecourse but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten two and a half lengths by the filly My Lovely. On his third and final appearance of the season the colt carried top weight of 133 pounds in nursery handicap at Sandown Park Racecourse on 30 September. He finished second by a neck to Adweb, to whom he was conceding 25 pounds. =2001: three-year-old season= On his first appearance of 2001, Kyllachy contested minor handicap over five furlongs at Sandown in April. Ridden by Kieren Fallon, he was held up at the rear of the fourteen runner field and struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile. When Fallon switched to the right in the closing stages, Kyllachy accelerated into the lead and drew away from the field to win \\"easily\\" by five lengths. After a break of three months, the colt was moved up in class and sent to France for the Listed Prix du Cercle at Deauville Racecourse on 2 August and finished second to the French-trained Do The Honours. Eighteen days later the colt finished fourth when favourite for a minor stakes race at Nottingham. He ended his second year by finishing fourth in a handicap at Ascot Racecourse in September. =2002: four-year-old season= Jamie Spencer took over as Kyllachy's jockey in 2002 and rode him in all five of his races. The colt began his third season in a handicap at Newbury Racecourse in April and won by one and three quarter lengths after accelerating into the lead inside the final furlong. On 4 May, Kyllachy was moved up to Group Three class for the first time and started the 2/1 favourite for the Palace House Stakes over five furlongs on good to firm ground at Newmarket. His main rivals in the betting were Continent, Smokin Beau (winner of the Portland Handicap) and Speed Lord (Field Marshal Stakes), whilst the other runners included Jessica's Dream (Ballyogan Stakes), The Trader (World Trophy) and Bahamian Pirate. Kyllachy was restrained by Spencer before finishing strongly to catch Smokin Beau in the final stride and win by a short head. On 2 June, Kyllachy was stepped up in class again for the Group Two Temple Stakes at Sandown and started 9/2 third choice in the betting behind Invincible Spirit and Misraah (Sprint Stakes). Smokin Beau, Bahamian Pirate and Continent were again opposition whilst the other contenders included Kier Park (Cornwallis Stakes) and Vision of Night (Goldene Peitsche). After being held up in the early stages, Kyllachy took the lead approaching the final stages and sprinted clear in the closing stages to win by four lengths from Vision of Night. At Royal Ascot in June, the colt was made 11/10 favourite in a fifteen-runner field for the King's Stand Stakes. Before the race a majority share in the colt had been bought by the Cheveley Park Stud. He struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile and although he finished strongly he finished third, beaten a head and half a length by Dominica (a three-year- old filly) and Continent. Kyllachy moved into Group One class for the first time in the Nunthorpe Stakes over five furlongs at York Racecourse on 22 August and started the 3/1 favourite against sixteen opponents. His rivals included many familiar names including Dominica, Continent, Jessicas's Dream, Bahamian Pirate, Smokin Beau and The Trader whilst other major contenders were Malhub (Golden Jubilee Stakes) and Danehurst (Flying Five). The 66/1 outsider Lady Dominatrix set the pace whilst Spencer restrained Kyllachy before switching to the far side (the left-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint) at half way. Malhub took the lead inside the final furlong but Kyllachy ran on well to take the lead in the final strides and won by half a length. The outsider Indian Prince took third ahead of Continent and Dominica. After the race Candy said \\"That was not exactly the plan to go on to the far side. I did say go left a little but I thought he would go up the middle. Obviously the horse was happy going that way so Jamie let him go all the way. He's not only an exceedingly good horse but he is the most delightful character and he is very, very fast\\". When asked to compare the colt to other great modern sprinters he commented \\"I know you'd expect me to say amongst the best of them but I mean that. He's got the gift of being able to quicken up off the very strongest pace. He just changes onto his left leg, gets lower and goes quicker\\". After his win at York Kyllachy suffered from some soreness in his leg which was explained by bruising behind his right knee. Although he recovered soundness there was not enough time for him to be trained to full fitness for the Prix de l'Abbaye and his retirement was announced at the end of September. Candy said \\"It's just a pity that time ran out for the Prix de l'Abbaye. The yard will sorely miss him. Following his three weeks recommended box rest, he is now completely sound, and x-rays of his right knee look good. He will exercise here for ten days, and then go to Cheveley Park Stud\\". Assessment On Kyllachy's retirement, Candy called him the best sprinter he had trained whilst Spencer described the colt as \\"by far the fastest\\" he had ridden. Stud career Kyllachy was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Cheveley Park Stud in Newmarket. He had considerable success as a sire, with his progeny showing their best form over sprint distances. The best of his offspring have included Sole Power, Krypton Factor (Dubai Golden Shaheen), Dim Sum (Chairman's Sprint Prize), Twilight Son (Haydock Sprint Cup), Arabian Gleam (Challenge Stakes), Tariq (Lennox Stakes), Penitent (Joel Stakes) and Stepper Point (Sapphire Stakes).

The murders have been described as one of the most notorious unsolved murder cases in Australian history. Background Margaret Christine Tapp (3 June 1949 - 7 August 1984), a 35-year-old nurse who was studying law, and her nine-year-old daughter, Seana Lee Tapp (6 March 1975 - 7 August 1984) lived in Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia.  Investigation  Late on 6 August or early on 7 August 1984, an unknown assailant or assailants entered the home, beating, then strangling them to death with a section of rope. The victims' bodies were found in their beds in their nightwear the following day. Seana had been raped prior to her murder. The case was investigated but quickly went cold. As there were no signs of forced entry, and the victims were attacked in their beds, the perpetrator(s) were probably known to them and aware of the broken lock on the back door. Other leads included a Dunlop Volley footprint and a red utility vehicle seen parked nearby which was never traced. Potential suspects included work colleagues and acquaintances of the single mother, including a doctor who had been paying the house rent prior to his death. Several suspects were later eliminated via DNA analysis, although complications in 2008 pertaining to the contamination of samples retrieved from the murder scene have cast doubts upon the earlier elimination of some suspects from the police inquiry. In 2015, investigators reopened the case in a cold case review including the help of well known ex-investigator Ron Iddles. In 2017, an 1 million reward was offered for information that could lead to a conviction. Aftermath The Tapps are buried in Ferntree Gully Cemetery.

CNA's Institute for Public Research conducts research and analysis on domestic policy issues for federal, state, and local government agencies, including the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Department of Justice, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the United States Department of Education. It has four divisions: Education; Energy, Water, & Climate; Enterprise Systems and Data Analysis; and Safety & Security. * the Military Advisory Board. The CNA Military Advisory Board is an American defense advisory group composed of retired three-star and four-star generals and admirals from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps that studies pressing issues of the day to assess their impact on America's national security. History CNA traces its origins to the Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Group (ASWORG), formed in 1942 to assist the U.S. Navy with scientific advice for finding and attacking U-boats that were sinking commercial ships off the Atlantic coast of North America. Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics Professor Philip M. Morse founded ASWORG at the request of Capt. Wilder D. Baker, then commander of the Antisubmarine Warfare Unit of the Atlantic Fleet. Morse is considered the father of operations research in the United States. By the end of World War II, the organization had expanded to almost 80 scientists serving on eight military bases in the Atlantic and Pacific as well as at the Washington, D.C. headquarters. They advised U.S. forces on air, antiaircraft, submarine, amphibious, and antisubmarine operations. Though the group served the military, it was designed to be civilian and independent in order to preserve the objectivity of its analysis, and was administered by Columbia University. In 1945, the Department of the Navy decided to support the continuation of the group under the name the Operations Evaluation Group (OEG), which exists to this day as a division within CNA. OEG grew rapidly during the Korean War, during which one of its analysts, Irving Shaknov, was killed in combat. In 1962, OEG was merged with smaller naval advisory groups to form the Center for Naval Analyses. The first ongoing analysis support program for a non-defense agency began in 1991 for the Federal Aviation Administration. All non-defense work at CNA was brought together under its Institute for Public Research in 1993, with the Center for Naval Analyses remaining as the other division of CNA.

McClendon. The company managed affiliates responsible for natural shale gas and oil production and exploration in the United States, as well as management of assets, minerals, royalties and nonoperated properties. It was headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and employed over 450 people as of August 2015. AELP announced on May 18th, 2016, two months after McClendon's death, it would end operations and close by the end of summer 2016. History Oklahoma City businessman Aubrey K. McClendon founded American Energy Partners in April 2013 after leaving Chesapeake Energy Corporation, the company he co-founded and ran as CEO for 24 years. AELP began with a staff of 12 based in Oklahoma City. In its first year, it generated $1.7 billion in funding to develop and drill approximately 110,000 net acres of the Utica Shale formation in Ohio. McClendon received initial financial backing in the form of $1.25 billion from The Energy & Minerals Group, founded and managed by John T. Raymond, and First Reserve Corporation. During AELP's first two years, it focused on acquiring assets, building management teams and acquiring financing to enter natural gas and oil plays in Ohio, West Virginia, Oklahoma and Texas. The company created affiliates to focus on each of these areas. By the fall of 2014, AELP had raised a total of $14 billion in capital commitments to fund its acquisitions. Of that, $3.5 billion came from The Energy & Minerals Group. In February 2014, the company added to its initial 110,000 acres when it bought an additional 130,000 acres in the Utica Shale play; including 74,000 acres from Hess Corporation and 56,000 acres from ExxonMobil Corporation. That month, AELP also bought its first holdings in Oklahoma's Woodford Shale with the purchase of 120,000 acres from Calyx Energy II. In June 2014, the company acquired 63,000 acres of Texas' Permian from Enduring Resources II. In August of that year, the company bought 75,000 acres in Ohio's Utica Shale and West Virginia's Marcellus Shale plays from Terrence Pegula's East Resources, a $1.75 billion sale that freed up capital for Pegula to purchase the Buffalo Bills.Wawrow, John (August 5, 2014). Bills bidder Pegula closes $1.75 billion deal. Associated Press. Retrieved August 5, 2014. AELP invested another $251 million into Oklahoma shale drilling in November 2014. By May 2015, the company's affiliates had acquired 600,000 net acres in four states through its series of acquisitions. Also during its first two years of operation, AELP expanded in other areas beyond natural gas and oil exploration, including natural gas infrastructure when it launched American Energy – Midstream, LLC, in June 2014. Additionally in June 2014, Energy Transfer Partners LP announced that AELP would ship natural gas from the Utica shale play to the Midwest, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast and Ontario, Canada, using Energy Transfer's proposed Rover Pipeline. American Energy – Midstream and Regency Energy Partners agreed in August 2014 to construct and manage a $500 million, 52-mile pipeline from the Utica to the Rockies Express Pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline. In June 2015, the company announced that the affiliate holding its Utica and Marcellus subsidiaries, American Energy – Appalachia, LLC, had been renamed Ascent Resources, LLC. AELP stated that Ascent Resources would become an independent company. Two weeks later, the company announced that another affiliate, American Energy – Midstream, would also transition into a new company called Traverse Midstream Partners LLC, effective July 1, 2015. The company announced two deals with Australian companies in August 2015, expanding the company's operations internationally. A letter of intent between AELP and Armour Energy Ltd. gave AELP a stake in 21.5 million acres of drilling rights. AELP also entered another deal for rights to 14.6 million acres from Empire Energy Group Ltd. In September 2015, the company announced a partnership with EIM Capital to develop unconventional energy resources in Mexico.PR newswire (1 September 2015).https://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/eim-capital-and-american-energy-partners-join-forces-to-pursue- unconventional-energy-exploration-in-mexico-300135928.html Operations and locations Based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, American Energy Partners' business model is to create affiliate companies focusing on specific locations and aspects of the natural gas and oil industry. These affiliates then transition to independent companies, and, as markets allow, pursue IPOs. AELP and the affiliates it has created work in the areas of natural gas and oil production and exploration in the Utica Shale formation in Ohio, Marcellus Shale formation in West Virginia, Woodford Shale formation in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp Shale in Texas. The company also operated an affiliate to manage midstream pipelines until American Energy – Midstream spun off as its own company named Traverse Midstream Partners on July 1, 2015. It also provides asset management services. =Affiliates= As of August 2015, AELP's affiliates include: American Energy – Permian Basin, LLC (AEPB); American Energy – Woodford, LLC (AEW); American Energy – NonOp, LLC (AENO), which owns nonoperated natural gas and oil properties; and American Energy – Minerals, LLC (AEMN), which acquires minerals and overriding royalty interests. Additionally, AELP has created affiliates to raise money to fund acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, as well as own international properties. Five of the affiliates have transitioned into standalone companies: Ascent Resources, formerly American Energy – Appalachia; and Traverse Midstream Partners, formerly American Energy – Midstream. Ascent is itself a merger of AELP's Utica and Marcellus affiliates which owns 235,000 net acres producing an estimated 280 million cubic feet equivalent daily, and the company estimates its assets contain 1.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proven reserves. Permian Resources, LLC was officially formed from the American Energy-Permian Basin affiliate as of April 1, 2016. The Oklahoma affiliate, American Energy-Woodford, became White Star Petroleum, LLC earlier in 2016. Corporate affairs The company is led by founder, chairman and CEO Aubrey K. McClendon. As of August 2015, it employed more than 450 people, most of which were based in Oklahoma City. In December 2014, the company was ranked first among large corporations on The Oklahoman's \\"Top Workplaces 2014\\" list. =Chesapeake Energy Corporation lawsuit= Chesapeake Energy Corporation () filed suit against American Energy Partners on February 17, 2015. Chesapeake alleged that McClendon, its former CEO, had taken data from Chesapeake prior to leaving the company to use with American Energy. McClendon said his severance agreements allowed for him to take certain information. The American Energy – Utica affiliate, not controlled by McClendon, settled on April 14, 2015. The complaint continued against American Energy and other affiliates. An Oklahoma County judge ruled in May 2015 that Chesapeake's complaint against American Energy must go to arbitration, not through the courts.

The folklore places their first appearance in the 13th century, when Rhiwallon the Physician and his three sons were doctors to Rhys Gryg, prince of Deheubarth. It was said that they treated Rhys when he was wounded in battle near Carmarthen in 1234, but he died of his wounds shortly afterwards at Llandeilo. The family are supposed to have continued to follow the profession in the direct male line until 1739, when John Jones, the last of the line of physicians, died. Instructions for preparing herbal medicine attributed to the family have survived in the Red Book of Hergest, which dates from the late 14th century, and in other, more recent, Welsh manuscripts. Legend Rhiwallon, who supposedly lived in the parish of Myddfai in Carmarthenshire in the 12th century, and his sons Cadwgan, Gruffudd and Einion, were physicians whose skill became proverbial in medieval Wales. A number of families in the Myddfai district later claimed descent from Rhiwallon, the most notable member being Morgan Owen, Bishop of Llandaff, (d.1645), who inherited much of the estate of the physicians in Myddfai parish.Jones, F. \\"An Approach to Welsh Geneaology\\", Trans. of Hon.Soc. of Cymmrodorion, 1948, p. 400 A collection of treatises on humours, medicinal herbs, and similar topics in the typical medieval European tradition attributed to Rhiwallon was included in the Red Book of Hergest, a 14th century manuscript collection, under the title Meddygon Myddfai.Davies, P. The Physicians of Myddfai revisited, Botanic Garden of Wales Later antiquarians visiting Myddfai parish collected some further oral traditions regarding the family, including a legend of its origins. The first reference to this story occurs in a diary compiled by the topographer Richard Fenton, who visited the parish in 1808.James, D. (1991) Myddfai, its Land and Peoples, accessed 27-11-18 The story was subsequently expanded in an article in 1821 periodical The Cambro-Briton and in an introduction to the 1861 book Meddygon Myddvai. The latter version was based on the oral accounts given by three elderly residents of the parish in 1841, collected by William Rees of Tonn, Llandovery. Llyn y Fan Fach with Picws Du in the foreground In the folk tale as set down by Rees, a young man, son of a widow from Blaen Sawdde (near Llanddeusant) agreed to marry a beautiful girl who arose from the lake of Llyn y Fan Fach, with a promise that he would not hit her three times without cause, or she would return to her father. He complied easily because the girl was so beautiful, and they were happy for years putting up a house in Esgair Llaethdy near Myddfai, and bringing up a family there. The girl brought a dowry of cattle, traditionally still kept at Dinefwr Castle, Llandeilo, and other animals. But over time the man struck his wife three times: once, to remind her to fetch a horse, once to ask why she was crying at a wedding, and once when she laughed at a funeral. She had to return to the lake according to the promise, taking the cattle with her and leaving behind her husband and their three sons. The sons often walked around the lake hoping to see their mother again. One day she appeared to the eldest son, Rhiwallon, presented him with a collection of medicinal prescriptions and instructions, and told him that his future and that of his descendants was to be a healer. She later returned and passed him information on herbs and plants to be used in cures. In due course Rhiwallon went to the court of Rhys Gryg of Deheubarth, where he became a famous doctor, as did his own sons. The legend was further elaborated by the story that some of Rhiwallon's descendants continued to practice medicine in the area until well into the 18th century. In particular the \\"David Jones of Mothvey [Myddfai], surgeon\\" (d.1719) and his eldest son John Jones, surgeon (d.1739) who are both commemorated on a gravestone now located in the porch of St Michaels, Myddfai, were identified by local folklore as the last two members of the family of physicians in the direct male line. A second manuscript of herbal remedies attributed to Rhiwallon's family, which was brought to light in the early 19th century, was said to have been copied from one in the possession of John Jones. Descendants of the Jones family were still in the medical profession in the 20th century: in 1971 the Welsh Medical Gazette published the biographical profiles of two men, Surgeon-Major Edward Hopkins of Carreg Cennen Castle and Dr. John Powell of Tenby, who both practised medicine and were descendants of David Jones of Myddfai.Ellis-Davidson, R. (ed) (2003) Companion to the Fairy Tale, Boydell and Brewer, p. 198 The manuscripts The book Meddygon Myddvai, published in 1861 by John Pughe, collects together most of the materials attributed to the Physicians, which it groups under two manuscripts. What it terms the \\"first\\" manuscript is the material included in the Red Book of Hergest, corrected by comparison with other copies. There was a revival of interest in herbalism in 18th-century Wales and a number of people had made further copies, including the scholar, Edward Lhuyd, Thomas Beynon of Greenmeadow and the bard and translator James Davies (Iago ab Dewi) of Llanllawddog.Jones, G. P. \\"Folk medicine in eighteenth century Wales\\" in Folk Life, v7 (1969), 1, p. 67 The \\"second\\" manuscript printed in the 1861 book consists of materials found in a manuscript formerly known as MS Llanover C.24 and now held by the National Library of Wales. It was brought to light by, and is partly in the hand of, the antiquarian, bard and literary forger Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams). The text purports to be a collection of herbal medicinal prescriptions and herb names compiled by Hywel Feddyg ab Rhys ab Llywelyn ab Philip Feddyg, a descendant of Rhiwallon through his son Einion. It is supposed to have been copied by Williams in 1801 from a manuscript owned by Thomas Bona, physician, of Llanfihangel Iorwerth, Carmarthenshire, itself supposed to be a copy taken by Bona's brother William in the 1740s from a manuscript belonging to John Jones of Myddfai, the last of the family of physicians.Meddygon Myddfai, National Library of Wales, accessed 27-11-18 Williams' manuscript is followed by a smaller collection of medicinal prescriptions in different handwriting, said to have been compiled by Harri Jones of Pontypool. It has, however, been suggested that the Llanover \\"Meddygon Myddfai\\" manuscript is one of Williams' forgeries, and was compiled by him based on the materials he found in Harri Jones's manuscript.Williams, G J. \\"Meddygon Myddfai\\", Llên Cymru, v. I, num 3, pp. 169–73 Williams also appears to have had access to a copy of James Davies's version of the \\"first\\" manuscript.

Outside his Olympic career, Vasiliev has won a total of seven medals in a major international competition, spanning the ISSF World Cup series, the European Championships and the World Championships. Currently residing in Brest, Belarus, Vasiliev trains under his longtime coach Gennadiy Sotskov for the shooting team at Dynamo. Vasiliev was born in Dushanbe, Tajik SSR. His Olympic debut came as part of the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, representing the former Tajik SSR. There, he shot brilliantly a total of 667.0 to tie for fourth position with Hungary's Jószef Sike in the inaugural 10 m running target final, falling short of an Olympic bronze by just a four-point margin. Twelve years after his last Olympics, Vasiliev competed for the second time in the men's 10 m running target, as a member of the Belarusian shooting team, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He managed to get a minimum qualifying standard of 584 to join with fellow marksman Andrei Kazak and secure an Olympic berth for Belarus in his pet event, following a top finish at the European Championships a year earlier in Gothenburg, Sweden. Vasiliev marked a steady 287 in the slow-target portion and 282 in the fast-moving round to accumulate a total score of 569 points, shutting him out of the final to thirteenth in a 19-shooter field.

Her research contributed to the discovery of gene splicing, and in 1993, her collaborator, Richard J. Roberts, received the Nobel Prize for the research, leading some to assert that Chow should have received the honor as well. Biography Chow was born in Hunan Province, Republic of China. Her father Chou Te-wei (周德偉) was a well known economist who worked in the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of China on Taiwan. She studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University, graduating in 1965 before moving to California to pursue graduate studies in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, earning her Ph.D in 1973. She then undertook post-doctoral training at the University of California, San Francisco, researching the monkey tumor virus SV40. She and her husband, fellow scientist Thomas Broker, joined Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1975. It was here that, in the process of studying the genetic organization, DNA transcription, and RNA translation of adenoviruses, she and her colleagues discovered RNA splicing in 1977. This finding led to her collaborator, Richard Roberts, winning the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Phillip Sharp from MIT whose team independently made the discovery). Many feel that Chow deserved a share of the prize (see Nobel Prize controversy).Anthony Flint (5 November 1993) , Boston Globe. In 1984, she took a job with the University of Rochester School of Medicine, studying the genome of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Chow became a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 1993, studying genetics and virology, focusing on diseases such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS. At UAB, Chow developed a method to produce large amounts of one of the most dominant cancer-causing HPV strains, HPV-18, in the laboratory, enabling her and her team to study HPV's entire replicative cycle. Nobel Prize controversy In 1993, her collaborator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Richard J. Roberts, was awarded the Nobel Prize, along with researcher Phillip Sharp, for the discovery of RNA splicing. Roberts called the award a \\"tribute\\" to his co-workers, including Chow. However, other scientists felt that Chow, who operated the electron microscope that allowed researchers to observe the splicing process, should have been included among the scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the research. Chow told the Boston Globe that her contributions \\"were not trivial… it was a new type of experiment and needed to be designed and set up.\\" Key publications * Selected honors *Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences, 2012 *Member of Academia Sinica  References  Category:Women biochemists Category:Chemists from Hunan Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:University of Alabama at Birmingham faculty Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Living people Category:Taiwanese people from Hunan Category:Taiwanese women scientists Category:Chinese women biologists Category:Chinese women chemists Category:Taiwanese biochemists Category:Members of Academia Sinica Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Educators from Hunan Category:Biologists from Hunan ","title":"Louise Chow"},{"id":"47721811","text":"Tranatocetus is an extinct genus of mysticete from the late Miocene (Tortonian) of Jutland, Denmark.

Description Skull of the holotype specimen Tranatocetus is similar to \\"Aulocetus\\" latus, \\"Cetotherium\\" megalophysum, \\"Cetotherium\\" vandelli, Mesocetus, and Mixocetus in having rostral bones that override the frontals and contact the parietals, nasals dividing the maxillae on the vertex, a dorsoventrally bent occipital shield with a more horizontal anterior portion and more vertical posterior portion, and a tympanic bulla with short, narrow anterior portion with rounded or squared anterior end and wider and higher posterior portion that is particularly swollen in the posteroventral area. Like other tranatocetids, the skull vertex of Tranatocetus is X-shaped in dorsal view. However, Tranatocetus differs in having a wide skull with laterally expanded squamosals, straight ascending processes of maxillae which extend parallel to each other (rather than tapering and converging posteriorly), small lateral projection of the posterior meatal crest on the posterolateral side of the postglenoid process and paroccipital processes extending far posterior to the occipital condyles. Classification Tranatocetus was originally classified as a member of the thalassothere family Tranatocetidae, which includes a number of mysticetes more closely related to Balaenopteroidea than to Cetotheriidae. When first described, Tranatocetus was erected as a new species of Mesocetus, M. argillarius. However, a detailed redescription of this species found it to be generically distinct from Mesocetus proper, necessitating its recognition as a new genus. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Marx et al. (2019) recovered Tranatocetus deeply nested within the family Cetotheriidae, as sister taxon to Metopocetus.

He also helped found the art journal Dessin: Revue d'Art, d'Éducation et d'Enseignement. As well as his work as a painter, he worked as designer in lace. Later in life Aubert became a supervisor of the decorative painting atelier of the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs.  Career  Aubert exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1895, and in 1896 took part in the first exhibition organised by Les Cinq. Les Cinq took part in the 1897 Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts exhibition, designing the furnishings for a bedroom. Aubert's part in this project was the wall hangings, curtains, chair covers, a silk screen and the carpets. Some of the few remaining examples of Aubert's lace work can be found displayed at the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Maison des dentelles d'Argentan. His decision to work in lace may have been influenced by the strong tradition of lace-making found in Langrune-Sur-Mer. He frequently collaborated with the lace manufacturer, Robert Frères. Together with Robert Frères, Aubert developed intricate polychrome lace work that was exhibited at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes in 1898 and 1901. The art critic Julius Meier-Graefe was a particular fan, frequently praising in Aubert in the art journal, Art Décoratif. When Meier-Graefe opened his shop La Maison Moderne in 1899, the entire lace counter was reserved for Aubert's work. Les Cinq and its successor groups believed in art for all, hence the group's later name. As part of this, members designed works that could be mass-produced and therefore encourage beauty in the houses of all strata of society, not just the rich. This may explain Aubert's collaboration with Robert Frères and other companies such as the Pilon printed velvet company and the Sallandrouze Brothers carpet and tapestry factory. In 1905 Aubert collaborated with Émile Bliault on a 'Maison Ouvrière' (Working Class House) for the Exposition d'Économie Sociale et d'Hygiène, as part of his ideal of bringing art to everyone. From 1907 to 1935, Aubert supervised the decorative painting atelier at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs. One of his developments of the course of the atelier was to include a competitive exam where the students were required to decorate an entire room. This was to teach the students how to develop harmonious designs in a variety of materials including wood, ceramics and metals. He was also part of the Technical and Administrative Council of the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres in the 1920s.  Notable works  An example of Aubert's art, a cotton textile print of water irises, is found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. The original print was used by the Groupe des Six (the group Les Cinq developed into) to line the walls of their 1898 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modernes. As well as the example found in the Metropolitan Museum's collection, other colourways of the pattern can be found in the Textile Museum in Krefeld and the Landesmuseum in Stuttgart. More of Aubert's work survives in the Musée de la Houille Blanche, the preserved house of industrialist Aristide Bergès, a rare example of a place where art nouveau decorative art and objects remain in collections and places that they were designed for.

History It was created in September 2010, started its operations in December 2012 and the environmental testing facilities were officially inaugurated in September 2013, when ARSAT-1 did its whole testing cycle. Its creation enabled the country to cover the whole life cycle of satellite design and operation. The creation of CEATSA enabled Argentina to cover the whole cycle of satellite design and manufacturing. Previously, national satellites like SAC-D had to be tested on the Brazilian INPE. This was expensive since the move of personnel and ground support equipment associated with a single satellite was significant. Since the Brazilian testing facilities were too small for the size of the ARSAT satellites, it simply made economic sense to actually build the facilities. The actual investment on the company was of approximately 40 Million US dollars.

The classification is uncertain: the animal had a unique H-shaped body ranging from 2 to 11 cm long, and researchers have suggested a hemichordate or hydrozoan affinity. Examples of Etacystis have been found only in the Mazon Creek fossil beds of the Midwestern United States. Etymology Etacystis communis takes its genus name from its shape, being roughly similar in shape to the letter \\"H\\". Eta is the Greek letter \\"H\\" while cystis, from the Greek kystis, means sac or bladder, referring to the organism's sac-like body plan. The specific name refers to the relatively common occurrence of the animal in the Mazon Creek fossil beds. Only a single species has been described. Description Etacystis is an unusual animal of uncertain affinities, found among the Essex fauna of the Mazon Creek beds. It displays, as described above, a roughly H-shaped body plan. It has a stolon-like structure from which a peduncle arises at approximate right angles. The distal end of the peduncle has two arm-like extensions of unequal length, and a sac-like structure is attached to the peduncle by a short stalk, in the direction of the shorter of the two arms. Relatively large for the animals of its time, Etacystis fossils of up to 11 cm have been known, with incomplete specimens considered to have been up to 15 cm in life. The holotype is 5 cm across from tip of sac to tip of arm, and the smallest specimens have measured as little as 2 cm. The H-animal is most likely a colonial organism that continued to grow throughout its lifetime, explaining the wide variation in specimen sizes found. The exact shape of the main sac varies significantly from specimen to specimen, from lobe-shaped to heart-shaped and others. Affinity There is insufficient evidence to align Etacystis to any phylum with certainty. However, it is considered by Nitecki and Schram that there are similarities with the Hemichordata which includes the acorn worms, and an affinity to this group is considered likely. The organism may have a close affinity to the Pterobranchia class, which likely includes the graptolite organisms, however it is not certain if it belongs within the class or is a sister clade. The modern pterobranchs usually only grow to about a centimetre, unlike the relatively large H-animals. An alternate opinion considers Etacystis to be a hydrozoan, provisionally in the Siphonophora.

Biography  He came from a long-established line of painters, etchers, architects and woodcarvers. His father came to Saint-Avold to participate in the rebuilding of a monastery and its church. He attended the Lateinschule in Saarlouis and went to Paris to complete an apprenticeship in carpentry. After that, he studied with Carle van Loo and François Boucher. In 1750, he was awarded the Prix de Rome in painting for his version of Laban giving his daughter to Jacob. It is not clear if he went to Rome, but it is probable that he did some church painting with his uncle in Laibach (Ljubljana). Laban Giving his Daughter to Jacob. In 1758, he joined his brother, the sculptor Christoph Melling (1716-1778), as a court painter in Karlsruhe. The following year, he married Josepha Lengelacher, the daughter of his brother's supervisor, the sculptor . In 1760, he completed a ceiling painting in the large marble hall of the Palace and, in 1764, decorated the altar at the Stadtkirche in Rastatt. He also served as an advisor to Countess Karoline Luise, helping her to acquire an art collection that later became the basis of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe. In later years, he travelled throughout the area. In 1769, he painted a ceiling fresco and altarpieces for the monastery church in Schuttern. The same year, he did decorations at the Capuchin monastery in Baden-Baden. The year 1770 found him in Hechingen, creating altarpieces for the Stiftskirche. Two years later, he was in Freiburg doing a large mural for the Grand Ducal Palace. Karoline Luise and her sons; Karl Ludwig and Friedrich. For many years, he operated a drawing school in what was once the palace's menagerie. His daughter Marie Luise (1762–1799) was one of his first students. Later, she took the name \\"Maria Rosa\\" and entered Lichtenthal Abbey, where she helped him paint murals in the meeting hall. In 1774, for financial reasons, he left Karlsruhe for Strasbourg, where he founded an art school; the \\"Academie de déssin d’après nature\\". He retained his contacts with the court, however and, after the death of Karoline Luise in 1783, created a catalog and directory of her collection. In 1789, during the French Revolution, his school was superseded by a system of centrally-controlled state schools. Six years later, he was able to open a private school, supported by his son, the painter Joseph Ignaz Melling (1764–1817), who later operated his own art school in Rastatt.

Hickox later coached at the college and high school levels. High school and college Hickox was a three-year starting guard at North Side High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Because of his size, he received little recruiting attention – gaining scholarship offers from only Western Michigan and Montana State. He opted instead for Allan Hancock College, a junior college in California. It was while at Allan Hancock that Hickox was discovered by Miami head coach Bruce Hale, who convinced him to transfer to UM. The Hurricanes reached new success with Hickox, as the diminutive guard made All-America teams all three seasons. He was a third-team pick by the Associated Press in 1960 after leading the team to a 23–4 record and the program's first NCAA Tournament bid. In his sophomore and senior seasons, Hickox was an honorable mention pick and in all three of his seasons at UM he was named to the UPI \\"Little All-America\\" team – which showcased players under 5 feet, 10 inches in height.

Coaching career After the close of his college career, Hickox was drafted by the Kansas City Steers of the American Basketball League. However, he never played for the team as he was drafted into the United States Army prior to the start of the 1961–62 season. After his military stint, he returned to the University of Miami as the freshman basketball coach, then spent some time as a physical education teacher in his native Fort Wayne.

He was a councillor to King Henry VI and was rewarded for his services, becoming a leading member of the East Anglian nobility. Beaumont held numerous offices for the crown, and was promoted up the peerage to become the first man with the rank of viscount. He also amassed immense personal wealth, acquired through inheritance, marriage, and royal patronage. Beaumont was present for some of the most notable events of Henry VI's reign. He was present at the arrest of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester in 1447, helped defend the king against Jack Cade's Rebellion in 1450, and helped suppress the rebellion of Richard, duke of York in 1452. While York and his allies ended up fighting against the king, Beaumont remained loyal to the Lancastrian crown during the 1450s, which saw the beginning of the Wars of the Roses. His personal loyalty to Henry VI eventually cost him his life – he was killed, bodyguarding the king, at the battle of Northampton in 1460. Beaumont's son, William Beaumont, continued the struggle against the Yorkists. Early life Born at Folkingham Castle, the eldest son of Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont, and orphaned by the age of four,Cockayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage II, ed. H.E. Doubleday (London, 1912), 62. Beaumont became Henry V's ward, who quickly put him in the custody of Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester. On 24 July 1425 his marriage rights were granted by the council to Sir John Radcliffe as part-payment for debts owed him by the crown.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981) He was first summoned to parliament as Lord Beaumont in 1431, and at some point between 1425 and 1436 he married Elizabeth Phelip. She was the daughter and heiress of Sir William Phelip, a knight of the Garter who was recognised as sixth Lord Bardolf. On his death in 1441, his large East Anglian estates went to his daughter, and so to Viscount Beaumont. This made him a leading figure in the region. Combined with his own inheritance in Leicestershire, he was a figure worthy of the association of William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (died 1450) and from there entered the household of King Henry VI.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), 190. In 1429 Beaumont was knighted by the seven-year-old king on the eve of his coronationGrummitt, D., Henry VI (Oxford, 2013), 75. and was in France with Henry the following year.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 279 Dr. John Watts has suggested that, as a royal ward, he may have been brought up in the king's household as a young man, and that his later generous treatment was a consequence of this. Watts noted that a council act of 1425 brought wards of his status 'permanently about the king.' Royal service All that remains of Beaumont's birthplace, Folkingham Castle, today His first major activity on the king's behalf was in France with the king's uncle, the duke of Gloucester in June–July 1436, which had the goal of relieving Calais, in a short, sharp campaign; albeit using the largest English army seen on French soil since Henry V's campaign. He briefly reinforced the Duke of York in Normandy, but all returned to England in late July 1437.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 204–5 For this service he was granted the county of Boulogne in reward; he was not, however, to ever return, even though the earl of Warwick had named him as one of the preferred nobles to accompany him back to France that year to relieve York.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 455 On 5 January the following year (by now a 'prominent Household servant,' according to Ralph Griffiths)Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 238 he was made steward of the Duchy of Lancaster and steward of Leicester, Castle Donington, and Higham Ferrers.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 233 In 1439 he was sworn onto the king's council, which was effectively running the country during the king's minority,Castor, H., The King, the Crown, and the Duchy of Lancaster: Public Authority and Private Power, 1399–1461 (Oxford, 2000), p. 140 and in 1446 he was 'intimately involved' in peace negotiations with the French.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 493 In 1445, he was appointed Lord High Constable, an envoy to France that same year beginning those negotiations, and five years later, to the Scots.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 762 n. 69 In June 1457 he was personally responsible for intervening in the activities of Bishop Pecock, a virulent anti-Lollard. However, his virulence led to suspicions of heresy, which resulted in Beaumont's instigation of a formal examination into the bishop's sermons and writings; Peckock agreed to recant and abjured his heresy in November 1457, resigning his bishopric a year later.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 796–7 =Royal favour= By 1440 he was firmly in the king's favour, being made in succession the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440),Goodwin, page 65 possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to himGriffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 356 and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, appointed a Knight of the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts.Hicks, M.A., English Political Culture in the Fifteenth Century (London, 2002), p. 55 These consistent promotions and favouritism have been the subject of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- was enough to make him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king,Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 118 and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Queen Margaret in 1448.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 271 n. 135 Second marriage His wife having died by October 1441, within two years he married Katherine Strangways, née Neville, who was dowager duchess of Norfolk and noble in her own right, being sister of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and thus what would have been considered a great marital prize. She brought him further territorial and financial augmentation. Political career Beaumont was fully involved in the political crises that punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group of like-minded men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king whether in council or on royal progress,Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 282 although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 292 n. 30 As Steward of England,Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 613 he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of SalisburyJacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 483\\\\- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447. Throughout the subsequent period of foreign catastrophe which, to contemporaries, came to symbolise the failure of Suffolk's government in the late 1440s, Beaumont not only supported the duke's policy but backed him during his impeachment.Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 611 With Suffolk's fall in 1450, it has been described as 'rather surprising' that Beaumont did not fall with him, having 'been involved in some of the regime's most unpopular activities.' For instance, he was a close associate and a 'protector'Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 494 of the 'headstrong' Sir William Tailboys (whom Griffiths also called 'knave-in-chief')Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 580 when Tailboys attempted to assassinate Lord Cromwell in broad daylight in November 1449.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 286 He had also suffered a minor assault on his Boston manor the previous year, but it is likely that he was seen as more impartial at the time than he has seen since. Indeed, far from suffering from his patron's fall, he was appointed to Suffolk's old position of Lord Chamberlain of England, although only for three weeks.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 288 At the outbreak of Jack Cade's Rebellion, he was commissioned on 10 June 1450 to reinforce London,Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 611 and accompanied Henry VI back to the capital in July.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 623 Later, with the duke of Buckingham negotiated with the rebels at Blackheath, offering them royal pardons.Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 620 At the time of the duke of Suffolk's murder, Beaumont had been an associate of the by now recalcitrant Richard, duke of York, having been one of the duke's feoffees in May 1436 and March 1441,Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 701 n. 15 and possibly even acting as the duke's councillor on occasion. He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first Protectorate (March 1453 – January 1454).Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 629 But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the first battle of St Albans in 1455, he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's stand-off with king at Dartford in 1452,Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 709 n. 134 and then sat in judgment on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a Neville, her family had by now aligned themselves with the duke of York. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454.Goodwin, pages 51–52 He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the duke of Somerset after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 739 Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 727, 762 n. 70 He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454.Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 508. He was one of the few Lords Temporal to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward.Jacob, E.F., The Fifteenth Century, (Oxford, 1993), 481. He was also part of the royal commission set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure;Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 750, 769 n. 192 the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young Prince of Wales,Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 781 which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 781–2 His loyalty the crown was such that in 1460 the Yorkists proclaimed him one of their most mortal enemies among the king's supporters.Goodwin, page 105 They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of Wiltshire and Shrewsbury, orchestrated the Yorkists' attainder at the 1459 Coventry parliament, in order to seize the Yorkists' lands.Lander, J.R., Government and Community, 1450–1509 (London, 1980), p. 205 It is likely that they were the public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way that Henry VI's queen (to whom he was a personal adviser), Margaret of Anjou could not be.Hicks, M.A., The Wars of the Roses (London, 2010), p. 142Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p. 262 Wealth and estates Map of the Battle of Northampton In 1444, further expanding his wealth, he bought the reversion of Sir Thomas Erdington's estates, as the latter was dying with no heir.Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 148 Like other lords involved in the fall of Gloucester in 1447, he benefitted immensely from the subsequent redistribution of the duke's lands.Harriss, G.L., Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 (Oxford, 2005), p. 615 Death and legacy His allegiance to the Lancastrian regime remained strong enough for him to take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life. Commanding the central battle of the king's armySadler, J., Towton: The Battle of Palmsunday Field 1461(Barnsley, 2011), 55. he fell, with the duke of Buckingham and Lord Egremont whilst forming a human shield in defence of the king,Sadler, J., Towton: The Battle of Palmsunday Field 1461(Barnsley, 2011), 56.Santiuste, E., Edward IV and the Wars of the Roses (Barnsley, 2010), 28. against the victorious Yorkists in the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460.Santiuste, E., Edward IV and the Wars of the Roses (Barnsley, 2010), 30. Even though the king had fallen into Yorkist hands, Beaumont was not attainted, and his son was allowed to enter into his inheritance. Presumably in an attempt to reconcile his family to the new regime. This failed, and Beaumont's second son (but who was his heir) – the by now second Viscount fought against the victorious army of the Yorkist king, Edward IV at the battle of Towton in March the next year.

Landscape  Waterfall in the stuben sandstone in the gully of the Hörschbach stream near Murrhardt The landscape is characterised by the rock - keuper that gives it its name and is the uppermost and youngest lithostratigraphic group of the Germanic Trias. It exhibits a variety of depositions of sand beds and marine sediments. The Keuper Uplands are largely forested because the soils that form on the keuper are not very fertile. Island clearings are found especially on the fertile loess or lias soils. The very steep-sided V-shaped valleys that are typical of the Keuper Uplands are known here as klingen. Such klingen occur in the petrographically harder sandstone beds of the keuper, for example in the Stubensandstein. These rocks are able to resist significantly the erosion forces (especially side erosion) of water. In less erosion-resistant rocks of the keuper like the clays or marls, the valleys are more deeply carved out so that many wider-profiled valley are formed.

He was taken to Tuna Canyon Detention Camp in Tujunga and then to an enemy alien internment camp run by the Justice Department in Santa Fe, NM. Bill, Mary and Billy were forced to leave their home on April 28, 1942. They went with Mary's mother and siblings to Santa Anita Assembly Center, although Junzo was still at Santa Fe. The family was then sent to Heart Mountain. Manbo documented his family's experience at Heart Mountain through Kodachrome photography with a 35mm Zeiss Contax camera. He took approximately 192 photographs at Heart Mountain, which he sent back to Los Angeles for processing. He started working at the Heart Mountain motor pool in late October 1942. In November 1944, he and his wife and son, Bill Manbo Jr., moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Manbo worked in a factory. They eventually returned to California and settled in Hollywood. Manbo died in 1992.  Exhibitions and books  In 2012, Eric Muller published Manbo's photographs in Colors of Confinement.

Location and shape  The ridge is a continuation of the small plateau around Ellenberg in the Württemberg county of Ostalbkreis, with which it is only linked by a narrow strip of land as a result of valleys to the west and east. It then runs west and in an increasing curve towards the west, finally heading southwest. Compared with the plateau it is only slightly, or even insignificantly prominent, the aforementioned valleys and, especially the northern foreland around Georgenstadt, however, lie some 60–80 metres lower down. Its three kuppen follow one another on the gently sloping ridgeline on the upper right, along which a forest track runs.

This was intended as a counterpart to The Sunny Side by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (1815–1852) and 40.000 copies were sold in a year.
