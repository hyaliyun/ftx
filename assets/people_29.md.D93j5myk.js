It was sculpted at Ragdale, her family's summer home, and achieved fame when it was featured on the cover of the non- fiction novel Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1994). Description Bird Girl is cast in bronze and stands tall. She is the image of a young girl wearing a simple dress and a sad or contemplative expression, with her head tilted toward her left shoulder. She stands straight, her elbows propped against her waist as she holds up two bowls out from her sides. The bowls are often described by viewers as \\"bird feeders\\". The sculpture was commissioned as a garden sculpture for a family in Massachusetts. A slight, eight-year-old model named Lorraine Greenman (now Lorraine Ganz) posed for the piece. The inscription on the pedestal reads: \\"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. II Corinthians 5:8\\"  Set of four  Only four statues were made from the original plaster cast. The first went to the Massachusetts garden. The second was sent to Washington, D.C., and is now located in Reading, Pennsylvania. The third was purchased by a family in Lake Forest and has never relocated. The fourth and most famous statue was bought by a family in Savannah, Georgia, who named it Little Wendy and set it up at the family's plot in Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia. It has since been relocated to Telfair Museums' Telfair Academy, where it is on display for museum visitors. Judson donated the original plaster model to the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois. Book cover The Bonaventure Cemetery statue sat virtually unnoticed until 1993, when Random House hired Savannah photographer Jack Leigh to shoot an image for the cover of John Berendt's new book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1994). At Berendt's suggestion, Leigh searched the Bonaventure Cemetery for a suitable subject. He found the sculpture next to a grave on the Trosdal family plot, at the end of his second day of searching, and had to make the shot quickly as dusk approached. He reportedly spent ten hours in the darkroom adjusting the lighting, giving the photo a moonlit feel and accentuating the halo around the statue's head. The cover image was an immediate hit, and Berendt called it \\"one of the strongest book covers I've ever seen\\". The book, published in 1994, became an all time bestseller, and soon people began flocking to Bonaventure Cemetery to see the sculpture. Due to concern about the amount of traffic at the grave site, the Trosdal family had it removed from the cemetery and later lent it to the Telfair Museums in Savannah, for public display in their Telfair Academy building. In December 2014, the statue was moved from the Telfair Academy to the Telfair Museums' nearby Jepson Center for the Arts. As of April 2019, she is in a special exhibit in the Telfair Academy. Further casts In 1995, Judson's daughter Alice Judson Hayes (aka Alice Ryerson Hayes) had a fifth bronze statue created from a mold. That statue was given to Ragdale, an artists' retreat in Lake Forest. Later, an authorized fiberglass replica was made from the original plaster model for use by Macy's in their display windows; it was later moved to a museum in Savannah. Hayes holds the copyright for the Bird Girl and has actively defended it by filing lawsuits against unauthorized reproductions, especially full-sized replicas. She destroyed the mold that was used to cast the 1995 replica, although the original plaster model still exists. Hayes has licensed smaller-scale replicas, which have sold well. She died on October 13, 2006, passing on the copyright to her daughter, painter Francie Shaw. Film use Warner Bros. produced an eponymous film adaptation of Berendt's book in 1997, directed by Clint Eastwood and featuring Kevin Spacey and John Cusack. After purchasing the rights to use the sculpture's likeness from Hayes, the studio created a fiberglass replica. The movie incorporated shots of the Bird Girl sculpture on its posters and in the film itself. After the film was completed the replica was sent to the Cliff Dwellers Club in Chicago, Illinois. Photographer Leigh sued Warner Bros. in November 1997 for copyright infringement over their shots of the Bird Girl replica in the cemetery, which were similar to Leigh's original cover photograph. The lower court ruled that the Hudson sequences with the statue were not infringement, but an appeals court found that the photographs used for promotional purposes, such as posters, bore significant similarities and remanded the matter back to the lower court. Warner Hudson and Leigh then settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Deaths Sylvia Shaw Judson died in 1978. Although she did not see her Bird Girl sculpture achieve fame, she was already a renowned sculptor whose pieces have been on display in such prestigious locations as the White House, the Massachusetts State House, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Jack Leigh died of colon cancer on May 19, 2004, and is buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, where he took his most famous photograph.

He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada with Oeyo, and the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Lady Kasuga was his wet nurse, who acted as his political adviser and was at the forefront of shogunate negotiations with the Imperial court. Iemitsu ruled from 1623 to 1651; during this period he crucified Christians, expelled all Europeans from Japan and closed the borders of the country, a foreign politics policy that continued for over 200 years after its institution. It is debatable whether Iemitsu can be considered a kinslayer for making his younger brother Tadanaga commit suicide by seppuku. Iemitsu also had well-known homosexual preferences, and it is speculated he was the last direct male descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, thereby ending the patrilineality of the shogunate by the third generation. Early life (1604‚Äì1617) Tokugawa Iemitsu was born on 12 August 1604. He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada and grandson of the last great unifier of Japan, the first Tokugawa sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Tokugawa, Iemitsu\\" in ; n.b., Louis-Fr√©d√©ric is pseudonym of Louis-Fr√©d√©ric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File . He was the first member of the Tokugawa family born after Tokugawa Ieyasu became sh≈çgun. (There was some rumour said that he was not Hidetada's son but Ieyasu's son with Kasuga no Tsubone). Not much is known of Iemitsu's early life; his childhood name was Takechiyo (Á´πÂçÉ‰ª£). He had two sisters, Senhime and Masako, and a brother, who would become a rival, Tadanaga. Tadanaga was his parents' favorite. However, Ieyasu made it clear that Iemitsu would be next in line as sh≈çgun after Hidetada. An obsolete spelling of his given name is Iyemitsu.

He also was installed officially as the heir to the Tokugawa shogunate. The only person to contest this position was his younger brother Tokugawa Tadanaga. A fierce rivalry began to develop between the brothers. From an early age Iemitsu practiced the sh≈´d≈ç tradition. However, in 1620, he had a falling out with his homosexual lover, Sakabe Gozaemon, a childhood friend and retainer, aged twenty-one, and murdered him as they shared a bathtub.Louis Crompton, Homosexuality p. 439 He married Takatsukasa Takako, daughter of Takatsukasa Nobufusa at 12 December 1623. His relationship with Takako was good but Takako had three miscarriages. Shogunal regency (1623‚Äì1632) In 1623, when Iemitsu was nineteen, Hidetada abdicated the post of sh≈çgun in his favor. Hidetada continued to rule as ≈ågosho (retired sh≈çgun), but Iemitsu nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the bakufu bureaucracy.Titsingh, J. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, p. 410. In 1626, sh≈çgun Iemitsu and retired sh≈çgun Hidetada visited Emperor Go-Mizunoo, Empress Masako (Hidetada's daughter and Iemitsu's sister), and Imperial Princess Meish≈ç in Kyoto. Sh≈çgun Iemitsu made lavish grants of gold and money to the court nobles and the court itself. Yet relations with Go-Mizunoo deteriorated after the , during which the Emperor was accused of having bestowed honorific purple garments to more than ten priests despite an edict which banned them for two years (probably in order to break the bond between the Emperor and religious circles). The shogunate intervened, making the bestowing of the garments invalid. When Lady Kasuga and Masako broke a taboo by visiting the imperial court as a commoner, Go-Mizunoo abdicated, embarrassed, and Meisho became empress. The sh≈çgun was now the uncle of the sitting monarch. In Kan'ei 9, on the 24th day of the 2nd month (1632), ≈ågosho Hidetada died,Titsingh, p. 411. and Iemitsu could assume real power. Worried that his brother Tokugawa Tadanaga might assassinate him, however, he ruled carefully until that brother's death by seppuku in 1633. Sh≈çgun (1632‚Äì1651) Hidetada left his advisors, all veteran daimy≈çs, to act as regents for Iemitsu. In 1633, after his brother's death, Iemitsu dismissed these men. In place of his father's advisors, Iemitsu appointed his childhood friends. With their help Iemitsu created a strong, centralized administration. This made him unpopular with many daimy≈çs, but Iemitsu simply removed his opponents. His sankin-k≈çtai system forced daimy≈çs to reside in Edo in alternating sequence, spending a certain amount of time in Edo, and a certain amount of time in their home provinces. It is often said that one of the key goals of this policy was to prevent the daimy≈çs from amassing too much wealth or power by separating them from their home provinces, and by forcing them to regularly devote a sizable sum to funding the immense travel expenses associated with the journey (along with a large entourage) to and from Edo. The system also involved the daimy≈çs wives and heirs remaining in Edo, disconnected from their lord and from their home province, serving essentially as hostages who might be harmed or killed if the daimy≈çs were to plot rebellion against the shogunate.Vaporis, Constantine. Tour of Duty. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2008. In 1637, an armed revolt arose against Iemitsu's anti-Christian policies in Shimabara, but there were other reasons involved, such as overly-high taxation and cruel treatment of peasants by the local lord. The period domestic unrest is known as the Shimabara Rebellion. Thousands were killed in the shogunate's suppression of the revolt and countless more were executed afterwards.Screech, T. (2006). Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779‚Äì1822. p. 85. The fact that many of the rebels were Christians was used by the Bakufu as a convenient pretext for expelling the Portuguese and restricting the Dutch East India Company to Dejima in Nagasaki. Over the course of the 1630s, Iemitsu issued a series of edicts restricting Japan's dealings with the outside world. Japanese, who had since the 1590s traveled extensively in East and Southeast Asia (and, in rare instances, much farther afield), were now forbidden from leaving the country or returning, under pain of death. Europeans were expelled from the country, with the exception of those associated with the Dutch East India Company, who were restricted to the manmade island of Dejima, in Nagasaki harbor. Japan remained very much connected to international commerce, information, and cultural exchange, though only through four avenues. Nagasaki was the center of trade and other dealings with the Dutch East India Company, and with independent Chinese merchants. Satsuma Domain controlled relations with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom (and through Ry≈´ky≈´, had access to Chinese goods and information, as well as products from further afield through alternative trade routes that passed through Ry≈´ky≈´), while Tsushima Domain handled diplomatic and trade relations with Joseon-dynasty Korea, and Matsumae Domain managed communications with the Ainu, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, as well as limited communication with related peoples on the mainland close to Sakhalin. Japan in this period has often been described as \\"closed\\", or under sakoku (ÈéñÂõΩ, \\"chained country\\"), but since the 1980s, if not earlier, scholars have argued for the use of terms such as \\"maritime restrictions\\" or kaikin (Êµ∑Á¶Å, \\"maritime restrictions\\"), emphasizing the fact that Japan was not \\"closed\\" to the outside world, but was in fact very actively engaged with the outside world, albeit through a limited set of avenues.Arano, Yasunori. \\"The Entrenchment of the Concept of 'National Seclusion'\\".

In 1643 Empress Meisho abdicated the throne. She was succeeded by her younger half-brother (Go-Mizunoo's son by a consort) Emperor Go-K≈çmy≈ç, who disliked the shogunate for its violent and barbaric ways. He repeatedly made insulting comments about Iemitsu and his eldest son and heir, Tokugawa Ietsuna. In 1651 sh≈çgun Iemitsu died at the age of 47, being the first Tokugawa sh≈çgun whose reign ended with death and not abdication. He was accorded a posthumous name of Taiy≈´in, also known as Daiy≈´in (Â§ßÁå∑Èô¢) and buried in Taiyu-in Temple, Nikko.Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice. (1999). Kaempfer's Japan: Tokugawa Culture Observed, p. 440. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Tokugawa Ietsuna. Anti-Europeanization of Japan and the \\"Maritime Restrictions Edict of 1639\\" During the 16th century, Japan was among the countries in Asia that appealed most to European traders and missionaries. A group of Portuguese arrived on the island of Tanegashima, becoming the first Europeans to enter Japan. This began the so-called Nanban trade (ÂçóËõÆË≤øÊòì Nanban b≈çeki) period. From 1545 onwards, Japan saw the arrival of numerous European ships, first from Portugal, and later from Spain, the Netherlands and England. Starting in 1549, with the arrival of Francis Xavier at Kagoshima, a large missionary campaign, led by the Society of Jesus, began to shake Japan's social structures. Furthermore, on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´, in order to preserve the European trade in their lands, some daimy≈çs agreed to be converted to Christianity. By the beginning of the 17th century a half million Japanese people had converted to Christianity (out of population of 11 million). However, during this period of Europeanization, adverse feelings towards the foreigners started spreading across Japan. Following Spain's conquest of the Philippines between 1565 and 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the supreme military/political authority in Japan at the time, began to more strongly doubt the Europeans' good intentions, and questioned the loyalty of the Christian daimy≈çs. Seeing the threat that Christianity potentially posed to political stability, and to the daimy≈çs loyalty to him over the Church, he issued Anti-Christian Edicts, expelling foreign missionaries, and ordering the crucifixion of a number of prominent Catholic proselytizers and converts. However, it was not until the reign of Tokugawa Iemitsu that anti-Christian policies were more fully expanded and more permanently put into effect. The century-long presence of Catholic traders and missionaries in Japan ended in the 1630s when Iemitsu ordered the expulsion of nearly every European from the country. European access to trade relations with Japan was restricted to one Dutch ship each year. Iemitsu's policies on this matter were reinforced after the execution of two Portuguese men who came to plead for the re-establishment of Japan's earlier foreign trade policy. By the end of the 1630s, Iemitsu had issued a series of edicts more extensively detailing a system of restrictions on the flow of people, goods, and information in and out of the country. The most famous of those edicts was the so-called Sakoku Edict of 1635. It contained the main restrictions introduced by Iemitsu. With it, he forbade every Japanese ship and person to travel to another country, or to return to Japanese shores. The punishment for violation was death. The edict offered lavish gifts and awards for anyone who could provide information about priests and their followers who secretly practiced and spread their religion across the country. Furthermore, every newly arrived ship was required to be thoroughly examined for Catholic priests and followers. The document pays extremely close attention to every detail regarding incoming foreign ships. For example, merchants coming from abroad had to submit a list of the goods they were bringing with them before being granted permission to trade. Additional provisions specified details of the timing and logistics of trade. For example, one clause declares that the \\"date of departure homeward for foreign ships shall not be later than the twentieth day of the ninth month\\". In addition to this, Iemitsu forbade alterations of the set price for raw silk and thus made sure that competition between trading cities was brought to a minimum. The measures Iemitsu enacted were so powerful that it was not until the 1850s that Japanese ports opened to a wider range of trading partners, Westerners were free to settle and travel within Japan, and Japanese were once more free to travel overseas. This period of \\"maritime restrictions\\", from the 1630s until the 1850s, is, as described above, very commonly referred to as sakoku, or as \\"the Closed Country\\", but many scholars today argue against the notion that Japan was \\"closed\\". They argue that Japan's international relations policies during this period should be understood, rather, as simply being aimed at keeping international interactions under tight control; furthermore, they emphasize that Japan was not alone in seeking to control, and limit, international interactions, and that in fact nearly every major power at the time had policies in place dictating who could trade, at which ports, at which times, and in what manner.

Early years The son of Thayne Alden Hedges and Ruth Evelyn Hedges Ipsen, Michael Hedges was born in Sacramento, California. His life in music began in Enid, Oklahoma, as played flute and guitar. He enrolled at Phillips University in Enid to study classical guitar and composition under E. J. Ulrich, who Hedges credits as his biggest influence from his academic training. Hedges studied as a composition major at Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland where he applied his classical background steel-string acoustic guitar, also studying electronic music.Michael Hedges - Interview Enid, OK, with Janice Anrukaitis (published on YouTube, Aug 24, 2010) Hedges made a living by playing and singing in pubs and restaurants in Baltimore while a student at Peabody. From 1976 to 1977 he played electric guitar and flute for a local group called Lotus Band, which he left to start performing as a solo acoustic act. In 1980, he made plans to move to California to study music at Stanford University. Hedges was contacted in February 1981 by William Ackerman who heard him perform at the Varsity Theater in Palo Alto. On a napkin Ackerman signed Hedges to a recording contract with Windham Hill. Recordings Hedges' first two albums for Windham Hill were Breakfast in the Field and Aerial Boundaries. He wrote nearly exclusively in alternate tunings. His early recordings and most of the Breakfast in the Field album were recorded on the Ken DuBourg guitar and his Martin D-28 \\"Barbara\\". Some of the techniques he used include slap harmonics (created by slapping the strings over a harmonic node), use of right hand hammer-ons (particularly on bass notes), use of the left hand for melodic or rhythmic hammer-ons and pull offs, percussive slapping on the guitar body, as well as unusual strummings. He made extensive use of string damping as employed in classical guitar, and was known to insist strongly on the precise duration of sounds and silences in his pieces. He played guitar variants like the harp guitar (an instrument with additional bass strings), and the TransTrem guitar. He was a multi-instrumentalist who played piano, percussion, tin whistle, harmonica, and flute. Bassist Michael Manring contributed to nearly all of Hedges' records. Frustrated that his published work reflected only the instrumental side of his creative output, Hedges convinced Windham Hill to release Watching My Life Go By, a 1985 studio recording of his vocal originals written over a span of five years‚Äîsongs often performed at his concerts leading up to the album's release. His fourth album, a live recording called, Live on the Double Planet, was assembled from 40 of his live concerts from 1986 to 1987. His musical education was largely in modern 20th century composition. He listened to Martin Carthy, John Martyn, and the Beatles, but his approach to composition owed much to Igor Stravinsky, Edgard Var√®se, Anton Webern, and Steve Reich, in addition to experimental composers such as Morton Feldman. He saw himself as a composer who played guitar, rather than a guitarist who composed music. He was often categorized as a new-age musician because of his association with Windham Hilll. Hedges toured briefly with Leo Kottke. These shows included solo performances by Kottke and Hedges and, as a finale, a number of duets including performances of Kottke's \\"Doodles\\" with Hedges playing a high-strung parlor guitar. Hedges' Aerial Boundaries album, released in 1984, included a tribute piece for the works of acoustic guitarist Pierre Bensusan, simply entitled \\"Bensusan\\". Bensusan posthumously returned tribute on his 2001 release Intuite (\\"Favored Nations\\"), with a composition entitled \\"So Long Michael\\". Personal life Hedges was married to flutist Mindy Rosenfeld but the couple divorced in the late 1980s. He was the father of two children, Mischa Aaron Hedges and Jasper Alden Hedges. Death According to his manager Hilleary Burgess, Hedges was driving home from San Francisco International Airport after a visit to a girlfriend in Long Island, New York. His car apparently skidded off a rain-slicked S-curve and down a cliff. Hedges was thrown from his car and appeared to have died nearly instantly. His body was found a few days afterward. After his death, his album Oracle won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.

The main segments of the show featured two unnamed dogs, called \\"The Big Dog\\" and \\"The Little Dog\\" in the credits. They were voiced by Brad Garrett and Mark Schiff, respectively. The show has been described as \\"Hanna-Barbera's answer to Ren and Stimpy\\", a hit show that premiered two years earlier. Like Ren and Stimpy, the Dogs characters are not very bright, the show is scored with jazz music, and the comedy style leans on gross-out body-secretion humor. Asked about the comparison, Hanna-Barbera CEO Fred Seibert was unconcerned, saying that it was \\"like Pearl Jam worrying about being compared to Nirvana.\\" A backup segment, Super Secret Secret Squirrel (a remake of Secret Squirrel), was shown in between the main 2 Stupid Dogs cartoons in the first season's episodes, similar to early Hanna-Barbera cartoons in the 1960s.  Plot  The show is about two unnamed dogs‚Äîneither of whom, as the title states, are very intelligent‚Äîand their everyday misadventures. The animation style is unusual for the time: a very flat and simplistic style similar to the early Hanna- Barbera cartoons of the 1950s and 1960s, but with early 1990s humor and sensibility. The Big Dog tends to talk much less than the Little Dog. When the Big Dog talks, he usually talks about food.  Episodes   Characters  * The Little Dog (voiced by Mark Schiff), a small tawny-colored Dachshund, is much more energetic and hyperactive than the Big Dog. The Little Dog is completely scared of cats, and when a cat (the very same cat every time) appears, it is the Big Dog who scares the cat away. * The Big Dog (voiced by Brad Garrett) is a large grey Old English Sheepdog with a purple nose. He is much stronger and significantly more stoic and reserved than the Little Dog, and speaks much less - on occasion he has also been shown to be surprisingly smarter than Little Dog. In one episode, an acquaintance refers to him as Jonathan. * The Cat is a small innocent cat which the Little Dog is terrified of, despite its being harmless. The Big Dog's bark causes the Cat to freeze in terror; however, the Cat is not afraid of the Big Dog unless he barks. * Mr. Hollywood (voiced by Brian Cummings) is a large man (who is both arrogant and loud) and likes to point out others' mistakes. He has a completely different job in each appearance, including teacher, farmer, casino manager, Noah and pet shop owner. When pointing out others' mistakes he will first say, \\"Well now, isn't that cute...\\" and then yell out, \\"...BUT IT'S WRONG!!!\\", usually accompanied by a blaring foghorn. * Kenny Fowler (voiced by Jarrett Lennon) is a small skinny kid with nerdy glasses, who is often pushed around by Buzz and often asks the dogs for help. He often falls down on the floor. * Buzz (voiced by Whit Hertford) is a school bully who picks on Kenny and says \\"What a Fowler!\\" whenever Kenny falls to the floor. * Cubby (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a fat, spotty man with big glasses, blonde hair and blue lips. In the episodes that he appears in, he assumes the role of a different job, like Mr. Hollywood. * Buffy Ziegenhagen (voiced by Tawni Tamietti) is a girl in Kenny's class that he has a crush on and who has a secret crush on him. *Red (voiced by Candi Milo) is a small, meek little girl that the dogs often encounter. When she speaks, she shouts one word (sometimes two) in the sentence very loudly compared to the quiet tone of voice she usually has.

It is close to the borders with Romania and Serbia, and is also the administrative centre of Vidin Province, as well as of the Metropolitan of Vidin (since 870). An agricultural and trade centre, Vidin has a fertile hinterland renowned for its wines.  Name  The name is archaically spelled as Widdin in English. Old name Dunonia itself meant \\"fortified hill\\" in Celtic with the typically dun found frequently in Celtic place names. A historical Romanian name of the city is Diiu.  Geography  Vidin is the westernmost important Bulgarian Danube port and is situated on one of the southernmost sections of the river. The New Europe Bridge, completed in 2013, connects Vidin to the Romanian town of Calafat on the opposite bank of the Danube. Previously, a ferry located from the town was in use for that purpose.  History  Vidin emerged at the place of an old Celtic settlement known as Dunonia. The settlement evolved into a Roman fortified town called Bononia. The town grew into one of the important centres of the province of Upper Moesia, encompassing the territory of modern north-western Bulgaria and eastern Serbia. When Slavs settled in the area, they called the town Badin or Bdin, where the modern name comes from. Similarly, Anna Komnene refers to it as Vidynƒì (ŒíŒπŒ¥œçŒΩŒ∑) in the Alexiad. The central streets of Vidin Orthodox Cathedral of St Dimitar (St Dimitrius) Vidin's main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century. In the Middle Ages Vidin used to be an important Bulgarian city, a bishop seat and capital of a large province. Between 971 and 976 the town was the center of Samuil's possessions while his brothers ruled to the south. In 1003 Vidin was seized by Basil II after an eight-month siege because of the betrayal of the local bishop. Its importance once again rose during the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185‚Äì1422) and its despots were influential figures in the Empire and were on several occasions chosen for Emperors. From the mid 13th century it was ruled by the Shishman family. By early 1290s Serbia expanded towards the vicinity of Vidin. Threatened by Serbian expansion, Shishman failed to repel the brothers forces, and accepted Serbian suzerainty.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 88 In practice, Shishman continued to be largely independent and dealt mainly with Bulgaria. Serbian suzerainty lasted until Serbian king Stefan Milutin¬¥s death, in 1321. As Milutin left no testament, after his death, in Serbia occurred a period of civil war with Stefan Deƒçanski, Stefan Konstantin and Stefan Vladislav II fighting for power. Shishman took advantage of this situation, set free from Serbian rule, and returned to the Bulgarian sphere. In 1323 Shishman was chosen to be the Bulgarian tsar. Shishman made an anti-Serbian treaty with the Byzantines, however, after Serbian victory over Bulgarians in the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330, Bulgaria lay militarily crippled and politically subordinated to Serbia's interests.The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism by D. Hupchick, page 89 In 1356, Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander isolated Vidin from the Bulgarian monarchy and appointed his son Ivan Stratsimir (1356‚Äì1396) as absolute ruler of Vidin's new city-state - the Tsardom of Vidin (Bdin / Badin). = Hungarian occupation of Vidin = In 1365, the Tsardom of Vidin was occupied by Magyar crusaders. Under Hungarian rule, the city became known as Bodony, but the occupation was short-lived. In 1369, the Second Bulgarian empire drove out the Hungarian military, but in 1396 Vidin was occupied by a foreign force again. = The Ottomans = The Ottomans went on to conquer the despotates of Dobrudzha, Prilep and Velbazhd as well. Vidin's independence did not last long. In 1396, the Ottomans invaded and turned Vidin into a sanjdak. In the late years of Ottoman rule, Vidin was the centre of Turkish rebel Osman Pazvantoƒülu's breakaway state. In 1853, The Times of London reported that Widdin, as it was called, was > a considerable town, with a population of about 26,000, and a garrison of > 8,000 to 10,000 men. Widdin is one of the important fortified places of the > military line of the Danube. It covers the approaches of Servia, commands > Little Wallachia, the defiles of Transylvania, and, above all, the opening > of the road which leads through Nissia and Sophia on to Adrianople. Its form > is an irregular pentagon; it is strongly bastioned, possesses a fortified > castle, with two redoubts in the islands, and its defences are completed by > an extensive marsh.\\"The Seat of War on the Danube,\\" The Times, December 29, > p. 8 In 1859 the English traveler Samuel Baker happened to visit Vidin and spotted the 14-year old Romanian Florence Barbara Maria von Sass being sold into slavery, by some accounts destined to be owned by the Pasha of Vidin. Baker redeemed her and took her with him, she eventually became Florence Baker, his wife and partner in the exploration of Africa Dorothy Middleton, 'Baker, Florence Barbara Maria, Lady Baker (1841‚Äì1916)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Sept 2015 Science historian chronicles true story of Lady Florence Baker, Penn State University, 3 February 2004, Retrieved 4 September 2015. Old Vidin 30s of XX century =Modern rule= During the Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885), the town was besieged by a Serbian army. Climate Vidin has a humid subtropical climate transforming to temperate continental climate. In the winter months, inversions are very common. The average annual temperature is . Population Vidin is the 20th town by population in Bulgaria, but serious demographic problems have been experienced in the area during the last two decades. The number of the residents of the city reached its peak between 1988 and 1991 when the population exceeded 65,000. As of 2011, the town had a population of 48,071 inhabitants. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887. =Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition= According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: *Bulgarians: 40,550 (91.8%) *Roma: 3,335 (7.5%) *Turks: 60 (0.1%) *Others: 199 (0.4%) *Indefinable: 280 (0.6%) *Undeclared: 3,647 (7.6%) Total: 48,071  Tourism  The Vidin Synagogue, deserted after Jewish emigration to Israel(historic Palestine ). Vidin maintains two well- preserved medieval fortresses, Baba Vida and Kaleto, as well as many old Orthodox churches such as St Pantaleimon, St Petka (both 17th century), and St Dimitar (Demetrius of Thessaloniki) (19th century), the Vidin Synagogue (1894), the Osman Pazvantoƒülu Mosque and library, the late 18th-century Turkish ruler of north-western Bulgaria, the Krastata Kazarma of 1798, and a number of old Renaissance buildings. Also remarkable is the theatre building which was the first Bulgarian theatre in \\"European model\\" and was built in 1891. Another tourist attraction in the Vidin area is the town of Belogradchik, famous for its unique and impressive rock formations, the Belogradchik Rocks and the medieval Belogradchik Fortress and also the nearby Magura Cave with its beautiful prehistoric cave paintings.  Transportation  Danube Bridge II at Vidin In Vidin is a border-station to neighbouring Romania via the Danube river. It was operated by ferryboats only until 14 June 2013 when the Vidin‚ÄìCalafat Bridge opened. Crossing by ferry was possible only every ¬Ω hour with just five trucks per ferry. Ticket prices were ‚Ç¨50 per truck and ‚Ç¨12 per car. The city has an airport (ICAO code LBVD) a few kilometres to the north-west; , there is no scheduled service, and the buildings are in a state of disrepair. Landmarks Close to the town lies a powerful medium wave broadcasting station (since 1973) whose signals can be easily received throughout Europe. It works on 576 kHz and on 1224 kHz with a power of 500 kW each. For transmission on 576 kHz a guyed mast equipped with a cage antenna at its lower part is used. The transmission of 576 kHz Radio Hristo Botev is on hold for now, because of the world financial crisis and it is unknown when it will resume broadcasting. A powerful FM transmitter on 88.2 MHz provides good coverage for Hristo Botev radio. Only 1224 kHz Radio Bulgaria remains atm. For the transmission on 1224 kHz four guyed masts, insulated against ground, which are each equipped with a cage antenna are used, which allows a switchable directional pattern.

In the 1940s, he was one of the most influential film critics in the U.S. His autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family (1957), won the author a posthumous 1958 Pulitzer Prize. Early life and education Agee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Hugh James Agee and Laura Whitman Tyler, at Highland Avenue and 15th Street, which was renamed James Agee Street, in 1909, in what is now the Fort Sanders neighborhood. When Agee was six, his father was killed in an automobile accident. From the age of seven, Agee and his younger sister, Emma, were educated in several boarding schools. The most prominent of these was located near his mother's summer cottage two miles from Sewanee, Tennessee. Saint Andrews School for Mountain Boys was run by the monastic Order of the Holy Cross affiliated with the Episcopal Church.Journal of the Eighty-Fourth Annual Convention of the Church, Diocese of Tennessee, Nashville, Tenn., 1916 It was there that Agee's lifelong friendship with Episcopal priest Father James Harold Flye, a history teacher at St. Andrew's, and his wife Grace Eleanor Houghton began in 1919. As Agee's close friend and mentor, Flye corresponded with him on literary and other topics through life and became a confidant of Agee's soul-wrestling. He published the letters after Agee's death. The New York Times Book Review pronounced The Letters of James Agee to Father Flye (1962 ) as \\"comparable in importance to Fitzgerald's 'The Crackup' and Thomas Wolfe's letters as a self-portrait of the artist in the modern American scene.\\"Rev. James H. Flye, 100, is dead; Friend of James Agee, the writer, The New York Times, April 14, 1985. Retrieved November 27, 2015. Fort Sanders neighborhood of Knoxville, TennesseeAgee's childhood home and the setting for his novel A Death in the Family. Agee's mother married St. Andrew's bursar Father Erskine Wright in 1924, and the two moved to Rockland, Maine. Agee went to Knoxville High School for the 1924‚Äì1925 school year, then traveled with Father Flye to Europe in the summer, when Agee was sixteen. On their return, Agee transferred to a boarding school in New Hampshire, entering the class of 1928 at Phillips Exeter Academy. Soon after, he began a correspondence with Dwight Macdonald. At Phillips Exeter, Agee was president of The Lantern Club and editor of the Monthly where his first short stories, plays, poetry and articles were published. Despite barely passing many of his high school courses, Agee was admitted to Harvard College's class of 1932, where he lived in Thayer Hall and Eliot House. At Harvard, Agee took classes taught by Robert Hillyer and I. A. Richards; his classmate in those was the future poet and critic Robert Fitzgerald, with whom he would eventually work at Time. Agee was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Advocate and delivered the class ode at his commencement. Career After graduation, Agee was hired by Time Inc. as a reporter, and moved to New York City, where he wrote for Fortune magazine from 1932 to 1937, although he is better known for his later film criticism in Time and The Nation. In 1934, he published his only volume of poetry, Permit Me Voyage, with a foreword by Archibald MacLeish. In the summer of 1936, during the Great Depression, Agee spent eight weeks on assignment for Fortune with photographer Walker Evans, living among sharecroppers in Alabama. While Fortune did not publish his article, Agee turned the material into a book titled Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). It sold only 600 copies before being remaindered. Another manuscript from the same assignment discovered in 2003, titled Cotton Tenants, is believed to be the essay submitted to Fortune editors. The 30,000 word text, accompanied by photographs by Walker Evans, was published as a book in June 2013. John Jeremiah Sullivan writes in the Summer 2013 issue of BookForum that, \\"This is not merely an early, partial draft of Famous Men, in other words, not just a different book; it's a different Agee, an unknown Agee. Its excellence should enhance his reputation.\\" A significant difference between the works is the use of original names in Cotton Tenants; Agee assigned fictional names to the subjects of Famous Men in order to protect their identity. Agee left Fortune in 1937 while working on a book, then, in 1939, he took a book reviewing job at Time, sometimes reviewing up to six books per week; together, he and his friend Whittaker Chambers ran \\"the back of the book\\" for Time. In 1941, he became Time's film critic.William Stott. Agee, James Rufus, American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved November 27, 2015. From 1942-1948, he worked as a film critic for The Nation.James Agee's reviews on the Nation's website. Retrieved November 27, 2015. Agee was an ardent champion of Charlie Chaplin's then unpopular film Monsieur Verdoux (1947), since recognized as a film classic. He was also a great admirer of Laurence Olivier's Henry V and Hamlet, especially Henry V. Agee on Film (1958) collected his writings of this period. Three writers listed it as one of the best film-related books ever written in a 2010 poll by the British Film Institute. In 1948, Agee quit his job to become a freelance writer. One of his assignments was a well-received article for Life Magazine about the silent movie comedians Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon. The article has been credited for reviving Keaton's career. As a freelancer in the 1950s, Agee continued to write magazine articles while working on movie scripts; he developed a friendship with photographer Helen Levitt.Helen Levitt, Who Froze New York Street Life on Film, Is Dead at 95, The New York Times, March 30, 2009. Retrieved November 27, 2015. ‚Äî Walker Evans of New York's Photo League wrote, \\"Levitt's work was one of James Agee's great loves, and, in turn, Agee's own magnificent eye was part of her early training.\\" =Screenwriting= In 1947 and 1948, Agee wrote an untitled screenplay for Charlie Chaplin, in which the Tramp survives a nuclear holocaust; posthumously titled The Tramp's New World, the text was published in 2005.Wranovics, John. Chaplin and Agee. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005, pp. 29, 66, 159. The commentary Agee wrote for the 1948 documentary The Quiet One was his first contribution to a film that was completed and released.Wranovics (2005), p. 78 Agee's career as a movie scriptwriter was curtailed by his alcoholism. Nevertheless, he is one of the credited screenwriters on two of the most respected films of the 1950s: The African Queen (1951) and The Night of the Hunter (1955). His contribution to Hunter is shrouded in controversy. Some critics have claimed the published script was written by the film's director Charles Laughton. Reports that Agee's screenplay for Hunter was not used have been proved false by the 2004 discovery of his first draft, which although 293 pages in length, is many scenes the film which Laughton directed. However, Laughton seemed to have edited great parts of the script because Agee's original script was too long. While not yet published, the first draft has been read by scholars, most notably Professor Jeffrey Couchman of Columbia University. He credited Agee in the essay, \\"Credit Where Credit Is Due.\\" Also false were reports that Agee was fired from the film. Laughton renewed Agee's contract and directed him to cut the script in half, which Agee did. Later, apparently at Robert Mitchum's request, Agee visited the set to settle a dispute between the star and Laughton. Letters and documents located in the archive of Agee's agent Paul Kohner bear this out; they were documented by Laughton's biographer Simon Callow, whose BFI book about The Night of the Hunter set this part of the record straight. Jeffrey Couchman, the author of a 2009 book about The Night of the Hunter, writes that Agees screenplay would have been a film with about six hours length, so Laughton had to cut and edit a considerable part of Agee's screenplay.Jeffrey Couchman: The Night of the Hunter: A Biography of a Film. Northwestern University Press, Evanston 2009, p. 87.  Personal life  Soon after graduation from Harvard, he married Olivia Saunders (aka \\"Via\\") on January 28, 1933; they divorced in 1938. Later that same year, he married Alma Mailman. They divorced in 1941, and Alma moved to Mexico with their year-old son Joel to live with Communist politician and writer Bodo Uhse. Agee began living in Greenwich Village with Mia Fritsch, whom he married in 1946. They had two daughters, Julia and Andrea, and a son John. In 1951 in Santa Barbara, Agee, a hard drinker and chain-smoker, suffered a heart attack; on May 16, 1955, Agee was in New York City when he suffered a fatal heart attack in a taxi cab en route to a doctor's appointment.James Agee (1909‚Äì1955) Chronology of his Life and Work He was buried on a farm he owned at Hillsdale, New York, property still held by Agee descendants. =Legacy= During his lifetime, Agee enjoyed only modest public recognition. Since his death, his literary reputation has grown. In 1957, his novel A Death in the Family (based on the events surrounding his father's death) was published posthumously and in 1958 won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. In 2007, Dr. Michael Lofaro published a restored edition of the novel using Agee's original manuscripts. Agee's work had been heavily edited before its original publication by publisher David McDowell.James Agee and Michael A. Lofaro, ed. A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author's Text. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2007. Agee's reviews and screenplays have been collected in two volumes of Agee on Film. There is some dispute over the extent of his participation in the writing of The Night of the Hunter. Let Us Now Praise Famous Men has grown to be considered Agee's masterpiece. Ignored on its original publication in 1941, the book has since been placed among the greatest literary works of the 20th century by the New York School of Journalism and the New York Public Library. It was the inspiration for the Aaron Copland opera The Tender Land. David Simon, journalist and creator of acclaimed television series The Wire, credited the book with impacting him early in his career and influencing his practice of journalism. The composer Samuel Barber set sections of \\"Descriptions of Elysium\\" from Permit Me Voyage to music, composing a song based on \\"Sure On This Shining Night.\\" In addition, he set prose from the \\"Knoxville\\" section of A Death in the Family in his work for soprano and orchestra titled Knoxville: Summer of 1915. \\"Sure On This Shining Night\\" has also been set to music by composers Ren√© Clausen, Z. Randall Stroope and Morten Lauridsen. In late 1979 the filmmaker Ross Spears premiered his film AGEE: A Sovereign Prince of the English Language, which was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and was awarded a Blue Ribbon at the 1980 American Film Festival. AGEE featured James Agee's friends, Dwight Macdonald, Robert Fitzgerald, Robert Saudek, and John Huston, as well as the three women to whom James Agee had been married. In addition, Father James Harold Flye was a featured interviewee. President Jimmy Carter speaks about his favorite book, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

The town lies on the southern bank of the lower Danube river, and is also the part of the Romanian border where it stops following the Danube. Silistra is the administrative center of the Silistra Province and one of the important towns of the historical region of Southern Dobrudzha. Silistra is a major cultural, industrial, transportation, and educational center of Northeastern Bulgaria. There are many historical landmarks including a richly-decorated Late Roman tomb, remains of the Medieval fortress, an Ottoman fort, and an art gallery.  Etymology  The name Silistra is possibly derived from the root of the old Thracian name of the lower part of the Danube \\"Istrum\\". By another theory, the city's name comes from the Latin words \\"silo\\" and \\"stra\\", meaning \\"awl\\" and \\"strategy\\".  Geography  Silistra is in the northeastern part of Bulgaria on the southern bank of the Danube River. It is located in the Bulgarian part of Dobrudzha. The municipality of Silistra covers an area of 516 km2 and includes the town and 18 villages. The area of the city-proper is 27.159 km2. Silistra is 431 km from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria; 141 km from Varna; and 119 km from Ruse.  History  Durostorum The Romans built a fortress in AD 29 on the site of an earlier Thracian settlement and kept its name, Durostorum (or Dorostorum). The earliest saints of Bulgaria are Roman soldiers executed at Durostorum during the Diocletian Persecution (303-313), including St. Dasius and St. Julius the Veteran. Durostorum became an important military center of the Roman province of Moesia, and grew into a city at the time of Marcus Aurelius. Durostorum became the seat of a Christian bishopric and a center of Christianity in the region. Auxentius was expelled from Durostorum by an edict of Theodosius depriving Arian bishops in 383, and took refuge at Milan where he became embroiled in controversy with St Ambrose.Mark O'Sullivan, The Social and Political Influence of Saint Ambrose as Reflected in his Letters, B.Phil thesis, Liverpool University, 1976. The Roman general Flavius A√´tius was born in the town in 396. When the Roman Empire split into the Eastern and Western empires, the town (known as , in Byzantine Greek) became part of the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire. As part of the Bulgarian Empire Durostolon was known as Drastar in Medieval times. The fort of Silistra Silistra Historical Museum Dunavska Gradina Park Around the end of the 7th century, the town was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire and the bishop of ( in Bulgarian) was proclaimed the first patriarch of Bulgaria. In 895 (during the Bulgarian-Hungarian War of 894-896), the Hungarians, allies of the Byzantines, besieged the Bulgarian army under the personal command of Simeon I the Great in the fortress of the town but were repulsed.Andreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 95, The next year the Hungarians were decisively defeated in the battle of Southern Buh. The town was captured by the forces of Sviatoslav I of Kiev in 969, but two years later it was taken by the Byzantines during the Battle of Dorostolon. It was renamed Theodoropolis, after military saint Theodore Stratelates, who is said to have come to the aid of Emperor John I Tzimiskes during the battle. In 976, Tsar Samuel restored Bulgarian rule in the region until 1001, when it once again became part of the Byzantine Empire. In 1186, after the Rebellion of Asen and Peter, the town became part of the Second Bulgarian Empire and renamed Drastar. In 1279, under Emperor Ivailo, Drastar was attacked by the Mongols; but after a three-month- long siege the Bulgarians managed to break through.Andreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 226, The town remained part of the Bulgarian Empire until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans around 1400. Throughout the Middle Ages, Drastar (possibly known by the name Silistra too) was among Bulgaria's largest and most important cities. During Ottoman rule, Silistra (Ottoman Turkish: ) was part of Rumelia Province and was the administrative centre of the Silistra district (sanjak). This district was later upgraded to become the Silistra Province and stretched over most of the western Black Sea littoral. The town was captured and recaptured by Russian forces numerous times during several Russo-Turkish Wars and was besieged between 14 April and 23 June 1854 during the Crimean War. Namƒ±k Kemal wrote his most famous play, Vatan Yahut Silistre (\\"Homeland or Silistre\\"), a drama about the siege of Silistra, in which he expounded on the ideas of patriotism and liberalism. The play was first staged on 1 April 1873 and led to his exile to Famagusta. The Ottoman Silistra Province was reduced in size, as the districts of √ñzi and Hocabey and the region of Bessarabia were ceded to the Russian Empire at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Edirne Province was created from its southern regions in 1830. Finally, Silistra Province merged with the provinces of Vidin and Ni≈° in 1864 to form Danube Province. Silistra was downgraded to a kaza centre in Ruse district in this province in the same year. Between 1819 and 1826, Eliezer Papo ‚Äî a renowned Jewish scholar ‚Äî was the rabbi of the community of Silistra, making this town famous among observant Jews. Up to the present, his grave is a focus of pilgrimage, some pilgrims flying from Israel and even from Latin America to Bulgaria for that purpose.Maariv, September 12, 2009, In 1878, following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, Silistra was included in Bulgaria. In May 1913, following the Second Balkan War and after unsuccessful Bulgarian-Romanian negotiations in London, the two countries accepted the mediation of the Great Powers, who awarded Silistra and the area in a 3 km radius around it to the Kingdom of Romania at the Saint Petersburg Conference. The 1913 Treaty of Bucharest ceded Silistra and the whole of Southern Dobruja to Romania. Silistra was renamed D√¢rstor by the Romanians. Bulgaria regained the town between 1916 and 1918 during World War I with the Treaty of Bucharest (1918), in which Romania surrendered to the Central Powers (including Bulgaria). The Treaty of Neuilly (1919) following World War I returned it to Romania. Silistra remained a part of Romania until the Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova in 1940, when the town once again became part of Bulgaria, a transfer confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties in 1947. Between 1913 and 1938, Silistra was the capital of Durostor County, (except during Bulgarian rule). It became part of ≈¢inutul MƒÉrii (Sea District) between 1938-1940 during Romanian rule. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Silistra developed as a center of industry and agriculture in the region, comparable to Ruse (because of the strategic position on the Danube) and Dobrich (due to the abundant fertile lands). This led to a major population increase which continued until 1985. After that, the population slowly started to decrease. Following the collapse of the People's Republic in 1989, many of its inhabitants migrated to other parts of the country or emigrated outside Bulgaria.  Climate  Silistra has a temperate climate, with cold snowy winters and hot summers.  Population  In January 2012, Silistra was inhabited by 35 230 people within the city limits, while the Silistra Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 50 780 inhabitants. National Statistical Institute - 2012 The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1986‚Äì1991, when it exceeded 70,000.

It is the second largest city in the Lubusz Voivodeship with 115,309 inhabitants (December 2019) and one of its two capitals with a seat of a Voivodeship governor (the other is Zielona G√≥ra). Previously it was the capital of the Gorz√≥w Voivodeship (1975‚Äì1998). Gorz√≥w is known for its successful sportsmen, including Olympic and world champions and national representatives. The city is also known as the hometown of former Polish Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. Around Gorz√≥w, there are two large forest areas: Gorz√≥w Woods to the north, where the Barlinek-Gorz√≥w Landscape Park is situated, and Noteƒá Woods to the southeast. The biggest oil fields in Poland are located near Gorz√≥w. Etymology The German name Landsberg an der Warthe, dating back to 1257, derives from the German words land or 'state' and berg or 'mountain' combined with Warthethe German name for the river Warta. The Spichlerz (City Granary) The Polish name Gorz√≥w, written as Gorzew, is known from Polish maps and historical books dating back to the 19th century or perhaps earlier.Henryk M. Wozniak, Gazeta Zachodnia, \\"Gorz√≥w tak - Wielkopolski nie.\\" It appeared in a compendium called Ancient Poland according to its history, geography and statistics published in 1848 by Samuel Orgelbrand in Warsaw. Ten years earlier, in 1838, the same name Gorzew was used in a book published in Paris with a corresponding yet broader title encompassing all of Poland.Polska Bibliografia Literacka Polska w kszta≈Çcie dykcjonarza historyczno- statystyczno-jeograficznego opisana przez Jƒôdrzeja S≈Çowaczy≈Ñskiego The current spelling of \\"Gorz√≥w\\" appears on the map featuring \\"Kr√≥lestwo Polskie\\" published in Lviv in 1900 with \\"Landsberg an der Warthe\\" in parenthesis next to \\"Gorz√≥w\\". The name is interpreted in several different ways according to rules of the Old Polish language, originating from \\"gorzenie\\" (fire, burning) or \\"pogorzelcy\\" (survivors of a fire), or alternatively \\"gorzelnia\\" (distillery) or \\"gorza≈Çka\\" (spirits). In Polish, it was the name 'Gorz√≥w' which eventually stuck, beating the alternative postwar name \\"Kobylag√≥ra\\", or 'Mare Mountain', which survives today as the name of a street in the city. The word Wielkopolski means \\"Greater Polish\\", after the voivodeship of that name of which Gorz√≥w was a part from 1946 to 1950, was added later. The area of today's Gorz√≥w was part of the historical region of Greater Poland until the mid-13th century. History Stamp of Prussia, 1SGr, cancelled at LANDSBERG an der Warthe (Brandenburg) in 1866 During the reign of the first Polish monarchs of the Piast dynasty there was a craft and trade settlement and until the mid-13th century, the land where the river K≈Çodawka meets the Warta was the location of a defensive fort established by the Polish Piast dynasty.Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN Warsaw 1976 In 1249 the Silesian Duke Boles≈Çaw II Rogatka had sold Lubusz Land in the west to the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg, and the city of Landisberch Nova (named after Altlandsberg) was founded on the site in 1257. The city was at that time an eastern outpost of the newly established Neumark region of Brandenburg, close to the Greater Polish fortress of Santok. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under control of the Duchy of Pomerania, but by 1325 it fell to Brandenburg again.Edward Rymar, Rywalizacja o ziemiƒô lubuskƒÖ i kasztelaniƒô miƒôdzyrzeckƒÖ, \\"≈ölƒÖski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sob√≥tka\\", No. 4/1979, p. 492, 494 (in Polish) In 1325 Polish, in 1432 Hussite troops beleaguered the city. In 1373 the city became part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or Czech Lands), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Krak√≥w. Poland was to buy Gorz√≥w and the surrounding region, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the city to the Teutonic Order. In 1454, after the Thirteen Years‚Äô War broke out, the Teutonic Knights sold the city to Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war against Poland. In the 16th century the city became Lutheran, with St. Mary's Cathedral changing its allegiance in 1537. In 1701 Landsberg (Gorz√≥w) ‚Äì like all of Brandenburg ‚Äì became ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Prussia. On 4 February 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars the Russian Ataman Aleksandr Chernichev and his Cossack troops defeated a French battalion of 1,500 men of Louis-Nicolas Davout's corps. In 1815 ‚Äì in the course of an administrative restructuring ‚Äì the town became part of Prussia's Province of Brandenburg. The city, like all of Prussia, was included in the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. View of the riverside boulevards and the city's oldest section During World War II, the Germans established nine forced labour camps, as well as four labour units for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war in the city. In early 1945 during World War II the town was heavily damaged following the retreat of the Wehrmacht ahead of the Soviet Red Army. The Red Army arrived in the city on 30 January 1945, approaching from the left bank of the river Warta. The Wehrmacht had already evacuated most of the city, and the advancing forces met very little resistance. Over the course of the next few days, most of the city centre was destroyed, reportedly through the accidental spread of a fire started in order to light the westward march of the Red Army. The city became part of Poland in accordance with the provisions of the post-war Potsdam Conference, pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the town was effectively ceded by Germany.; ; Most of the remaining German population was expelled. The last original inhabitants were forced to leave the city in the early 1950s. Between February and September 1945, the original population of the city was gradually replaced by Poles from central parts of Poland and those expelled from Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union (also known as Kresy). It was at this time that Gorz√≥w's significant Tatar and Romani communities arrived. Not having had an agreed Polish name, the town was initially renamed as \\"Kobylag√≥ra\\" on 30 May 1945, later as \\"Gorz√≥w nad WartƒÖ\\" on 7 July 1945 and finally \\"Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski\\" on 5 November 1946. Main attractions St. Mary's Cathedral Although the centre of Gorz√≥w was heavily damaged during the Second World War, there are still many notable tourist attractions in the city. The largest of these is the Gothic, red-brick Gorz√≥w Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, dating from the end of the 13th century, situated on the old market square. The city centre is overwhelmingly occupied by Communist-era buildings, although many have been beautified, most notably those around the old market square. Many of the fa√ßades of the buildings in the centre were renovated in anticipation of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Gorz√≥w in 1997. Due to the large number of parks and green spaces, Gorz√≥w has been termed 'the city of parks and gardens'. In addition to the central Park of Roses, there is also a viewing area on the hilltop of Siemiradzki Park which commands impressive views across the plains and woods to the south of the city. s Villa of Gustav Schroeder Chrobrego Street The city also contains the museum of Lubusz Voivodeship, which is divided between two sites. The Spichlerz or 'granary' dates from the 18th century and can be found on the left bank of the Warta. The museum, housed inside, frequently plays host to art exhibitions and has a permanent collection of artifacts and photographs relating to the history of the city. The other part of the museum, on Warszawska street, is housed in the secessionist villa of Gustav Schroeder. This section contains a wide range of artifacts, ranging from portraits of the 17th century, to weapons, pottery, and the Biedermeier interior furnishings of the villa itself. The Old Town was almost completely destroyed, but the New Town (19th century) has survived in good condition as a complex of hundreds of buildings and is in the Heritage Register. For the past few years, historical tenements have been successfully undergoing renovation. The Jewish cemetery of Gorz√≥w is on the western edge of the city. The cemetery was vandalised in the 1930s, but a number of graves still remain intact. Politics In recent years Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski has been known for former Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, who was born and worked here. After stepping down as the PM he was appointed as acting mayor of Warsaw and then as a counsel to a chairman of PKO BP bank. In 2007 he became one of the directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He now works for Goldman Sachs.

He was the only guitarist to have learned to play directly from Robert Johnson. Robert Lockwood was one of the first professional black entertainers to appear on radio in the South, on the King Biscuit Time radio show. Lockwood is known for his longtime collaboration with Sonny Boy Williamson II and for his work in the mid-1950s with Little Walter. Biography =Early life= Lockwood was born in Turkey Scratch, Arkansas, a hamlet west of Helena. He was one of two children born to Robert Lockwood Sr. and Esther Reese Lockwood, later known as Estella Coleman. He started playing the organ in his father's church at the age of eight. His parents divorced, and later the famous bluesman Robert Johnson lived with Lockwood's mother for 10 years off and on. Lockwood learned from Johnson not only how to play guitar but also timing and stage presence. Because of his personal and professional association with Johnson, he became known as \\"Robert Junior\\" Lockwood, a nickname by which he was known among musicians for the rest of his life, although he later frequently professed his dislike for this appellation. =Early career= By age 15, Lockwood was playing professionally at parties in the Helena area. He often played with his quasi-stepfather Robert Johnson and with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Johnny Shines. Lockwood played at fish fries, in juke joints, and on street corners throughout the Mississippi Delta in the 1930s. On one occasion he played on one side of the Sunflower River while Johnson played on the other, with the people of Clarksdale, Mississippi, milling about the bridge, reportedly unable to tell which guitarist was the real Robert Johnson. Around 1937‚Äì1938 Lockwood worked with Williamson and Elmore James in the Delta, at places like Winona, Greenwood, and Greenville (where they most probably met Johnson, who died in 1938). Lockwood played with Williamson in the Clarksdale area in 1938 and 1939. He also played with Howlin' Wolf and others in Memphis, Tennessee, around 1938. From 1939 to 1940 he split his time playing in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago; and Helena. On July 1, 1941, Lockwood made his first recordings, with Doctor Clayton, for the Bluebird label in Aurora, Illinois. On July 30 he recorded four songs, which were released as the first two 78-rpm singles under his own name: \\"Little Boy Blue\\" backed with \\"Take a Little Walk with Me\\" (Bluebird B-8820) and \\"I'm Gonna Train My Baby\\" backed with \\"Black Spider Blues\\" (Bluebird B-8877). These songs remained in his repertoire throughout his career. In 1941, Lockwood and Williamson began their influential performances on the daily radio program King Biscuit Time on KFFA in Helena. For several years in the early 1940s the pair played together in and around Helena and continued to be associated with King Biscuit Time. From about 1944 to 1949 Lockwood played in West Memphis, Arkansas; St. Louis; Chicago and Memphis. He was an influence on B. B. King and played in King's band early in King's career in Memphis. In 1950, Lockwood settled in Chicago. A 1951 78-rpm single featured \\"I'm Gonna Dig Myself a Hole\\" backed with \\"Dust My Broom\\" (Mercury 8260), and a 1954 release contained \\"Aw Aw (Baby)\\" backed with \\"Sweet Woman (from Maine)\\" (J.O.B 1107). In 1954 he replaced Louis Myers as the guitarist in Little Walter's band. He played on Walter's number 1 hit \\"My Babe\\" in 1955. He left the band around 1957. In the late 1950s he recorded several sessions with Sonny Boy Williamson for Chess Records, sessions which also included Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. Lockwood also performed or recorded with Sunnyland Slim, Eddie Boyd, Roosevelt Sykes, J. B. Lenoir, and Muddy Waters, among others. =Later career= Lockwood in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the 1982 World's Fair In 1960, Lockwood moved with Williamson to Cleveland, Ohio, where he resided for the second half of his life. In the early 1960s, as Bob Lockwood Jr. and Combo, he had a regular gig at Loving's Grill, at 8426 Hough Avenue. From the 1970s through the 2000s, he performed regularly with his band the All Stars at numerous local venues, including Pirate's Cove, the Euclid Tavern, Peabody's, Flipside Tavern, Wilbert's, Brother's Lounge, and, in the last years of his career, Fat Fish Blue (on the corner of Prospect and Ontario in downtown Cleveland) every Wednesday night at 8 p.m. He played his regular three sets two days before the illness which led to his death. The All Stars continued the Wednesday residency for two years after his death. His studio albums as a bandleader include Steady Rollin' Man, with the Aces (recorded 1970, Delmark); Contrasts (recorded 1973, Trix); ...Does 12 (recorded 1975, Trix); Hangin' On, with Johnny Shines (recorded 1979, Rounder); Mister Blues Is Back to Stay, with Shines (recorded 1980, Rounder); What's the Score (recorded 1990, Lockwood); and I Got to Find Me a Woman (recorded 1996, Verve). A 1972 45-rpm single included \\"Selfish Ways\\" backed with \\"Down Home Cookin'\\" (Big Star BB 020). Reviewing Does 12 in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said, \\"Lovers of urban blues will cherish this record by Robert Johnson's self-designated heir. It even boasts some adventurously progressive saxophone and twelve-string stylings that do no violence to a notoriously intransigent genre. But Lockwood is an undistinguished vocal interpreter, and only one of his originals‚Äîthe imperturbable 'Selfish Ways'‚Äîis worthy of interpretation itself.\\" His solo guitar and vocal albums include Plays Robert and Robert (recorded 1982, Evidence), Delta Crossroads (recorded 2000, Telarc) and The Legend Live (recorded 2003, M.C.). A duet session with the pianist Otis Spann in 1960 resulted in Otis Spann Is the Blues and Walking the Blues, released by Candid. At the age of sixty, in 1975, he discovered the 12-string guitar and preferentially played it almost exclusively for the latter third of his life. His most famous 12-string was a blue instrument custom designed and made by the Japanese luthiers Moony Omote and Age Sumi. It was acquired by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in February 2013 and is displayed there. A live performance by Lockwood, Henry \\"Mule\\" Townsend, Joseph \\"Pinetop\\" Perkins, and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards, recorded in 2004 and released in 2007 as Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas, won a Grammy Award in 2008 in the category Best Traditional Blues Album. It was the first Grammy Award for Lockwood and Townsend. Lockwood's last known recording session was at Ante Up Audio studio in Cleveland, with longtime collaborator Mark \\"Cleveland Fats\\" Hahn, to record the album The Way Things Go for Honeybee Entertainment. Lockwood died at the age of 91 in Cleveland, having suffered a cerebral aneurysm and a stroke. He is buried at Riverside Cemetery, in Cleveland.Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols & Stories. Cleveland, Ohio: Gray & Company. . His survivors included his wife, Mary Smith Lockwood of Cleveland; four stepchildren from his first marriage to Annie Roberts Lockwood, who died in 1997; and four stepchildren from his second marriage. Awards and honors His many honors and tributes included: a National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States presented by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton (1995); an honorary Doctorate Of Humane Letters from Case Western Reserve University (2001); an honorary Doctor Of Music from Cleveland State University (2002); induction into the Blues Hall Of Fame (1989); a street in Cleveland named Robert Lockwood Jr. Way (1997); three nominations with one win at the Grammy Awards and twenty-one nominations with seven wins at the W.C. Handy Blues Music Awards.

He was an early and influential blues harp stylist who recorded successfully in the 1950s and 1960s. Miller used various names, including Rice Miller and Little Boy Blue, before calling himself Sonny Boy Williamson, which was also the name of a popular Chicago blues singer and harmonica player. To distinguish the two, Miller has been referred to as Sonny Boy Williamson II. He first recorded with Elmore James on \\"Dust My Broom\\". Some of his popular songs include \\"Don't Start Me Talkin'\\", \\"Help Me\\", \\"Checkin' Up on My Baby\\", and \\"Bring It On Home\\". He toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival and recorded with English rock musicians, including the Yardbirds, the Animals, and Jimmy Page. \\"Help Me\\" became a blues standard, and many blues and rock artists have recorded his songs. Biography =Year of birth= Miller's date of birth is disputed. In a spoken word performance called ‚ÄúThe Story of Sonny Boy Williamson‚Äù that was later included in several compilations, Miller states that he was born in Glendora, Mississippi in 1897. A counter claim is made that he was born Alex Ford (pronounced \\"Aleck\\") on the Sara Jones Plantation in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. Another claim is that he was born on December 5, 1899. David Evans, professor of music and an ethnomusicologist at the University of Memphis, claims to have found census records that Miller was born around 1912, being seven years old on February 2, 1920, the day of the census. However, it has been argued that a census record claim of age without a birth certificate is not a reliable proof, as census clerks often made mistakes, especially in rural towns where few people could read or write. Miller‚Äôs gravestone in or near Tutwiler, Mississippi, set up by record company owner Lillian McMurry twelve years after his death, gives his date of birth as March 11, 1908. =Early years= He lived and worked with his sharecropper stepfather, Jim Miller, whose last name he soon adopted, and mother, Millie Ford, until the early 1930s. Beginning in the 1930s, he traveled around Mississippi and Arkansas and encountered Big Joe Williams, Elmore James and Robert Lockwood Jr., also known as Robert Junior Lockwood, who would play guitar on his later Checker Records sides. He was also associated with Robert Johnson during this period. Miller developed his style and raffish stage persona during these years. Willie Dixon recalled seeing Lockwood and Miller playing for tips in Greenville, Mississippi, in the 1930s. He entertained audiences with novelties such as inserting one end of the harmonica into his mouth and playing with no hands. At this time he was often known as \\"Rice\\" Miller‚Äîa childhood nickname stemming from his love of rice and milk‚Äîor as \\"Little Boy Blue\\". In 1941 Miller was hired to play the King Biscuit Time show, advertising the King Biscuit brand of baking flour on radio station KFFA in Helena, Arkansas, with Lockwood. The program's sponsor, Max Moore, began billing Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson, apparently in an attempt to capitalize on the fame of the well- known Chicago-based harmonica player and singer Sonny Boy Williamson (birth name John Lee Curtis Williamson, died 1948). Although John Lee Williamson was a major blues star who had already released dozens of successful and widely influential records under the name \\"Sonny Boy Williamson\\" from 1937 onward, Miller would later claim to have been the first to use the name. Some blues scholars believe that Miller's assertion he was born in 1899 was a ruse to convince audiences he was old enough to have used the name before John Lee Williamson, who was born in 1914. =Radio show in West Memphis= In 1949, Williamson relocated to West Memphis, Arkansas, and lived with his sister and her husband, Howlin' Wolf. (Later, for Checker Records, he did a parody of Howlin' Wolf, entitled \\"Like Wolf\\".) He started his own KWEM radio show from 1948 to 1950, selling the elixir Hadacol. He brought his King Biscuit musician friends to West Memphis‚ÄîElmore James, Houston Stackhouse, Arthur \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup, Robert Nighthawk and others‚Äîto perform on KWEM radio. Williamson married Howlin' Wolf's half-sister Mae and he showed Wolf how to play harmonica. =Recording career= Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Trumpet Records, based in Jackson, Mississippi. It was three years since the death of John Lee Williamson, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being \\"the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson\\". When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955, Williamson's recording contract was yielded to its creditors, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago. He had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. During his Chess years he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim, recording about 70 songs for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. His first LP record was a compilation of previously released singles. Titled Down and Out Blues, Checker released the collection in 1959. A single, \\"Boppin' with Sonny\\" backed with \\"No Nights by Myself\\", was released by Ace Records in 1955. In 1972, Chess released This Is My Story, a compilation album featuring Williamson's recordings for the label. It was later included in Robert Christgau's \\"basic record library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). =1960s European tours= In the early 1960s he toured Europe several times during the height of the British blues craze, backed on a number of occasions by the Authentics (see American Folk Blues Festival), recording with the Yardbirds (for the album Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds) and the Animals, and appearing on several television broadcasts throughout Europe. Around this time he was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied him, \\"those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do\\". Led Zeppelin biographer Stephen Davis writes in Hammer of the Gods, while in England Williamson set his hotel room on fire while trying to cook a rabbit in a coffee percolator. The book also maintains that future Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant stole one of the bluesman's harmonicas at one of these shows. Robert Palmer wrote in his blues history \\"Deep Blues\\", that during this tour Williamson allegedly stabbed a man during a street fight and left the country abruptly. Sonny Boy took a liking to the European fans, and while there had a custom-made, two-tone suit tailored personally for him, along with a bowler hat, matching umbrella, and an attach√© case for his harmonicas. He appears credited as \\"Big Skol\\" on Roland Kirk's live album Kirk in Copenhagen (1963). One of his final recordings from England, in 1964, featured him singing \\"I'm Trying to Make London My Home\\", with Hubert Sumlin providing the guitar. =Death= Upon his return to the U.S., he resumed playing the King Biscuit Time show on KFFA, and performed in the Helena, Arkansas area. As fellow musicians Houston Stackhouse and Peck Curtis waited at the KFFA studios for Williamson on May 25, 1965, the 12:15 broadcast time was approaching and Williamson was nowhere in sight. Peck left the radio station to locate Williamson, and discovered his body in bed at the rooming house where he had been staying, dead of an apparent heart attack suffered in his sleep the night before. Williamson is buried on New Africa Road, just outside Tutwiler, Mississippi at the site of the former Whitman Chapel cemetery. Trumpet Records owner McMurry provided the headstone with an incorrect date of death. Naming The recordings made by John Lee Williamson between 1937 and his death in 1948 and those made between 1951 and 1964 by \\"Rice\\" Miller were all originally issued under the name Sonny Boy Williamson. It is believed that Miller adopted the name to suggest to audiences (and to his first record label) that he was the \\"original\\" Sonny Boy. To differentiate between the two musicians, scholars and biographers have referred to John Lee Williamson (1914‚Äì1948) as \\"Sonny Boy Williamson I\\" or \\"the original Sonny Boy\\" and to Miller (circa 1912‚Äì1965) as \\"Sonny Boy Williamson II\\".  Legacy  In 2014, Williamson was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Helena, Arkansas. =Material loss= On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Sonny Boy Williamson II among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The adult male is in length, its tail accounting for two-thirds of the total length. It is unmistakable with its golden crest and rump and bright red body. The deep orange \\"cape\\" can be spread in display, appearing as an alternating black and orange fan that covers all of the face except its bright yellow eye with a pinpoint black pupil. Male at Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, Malaysia Males have a golden-yellow crest with a hint of red at the tip. The face, throat, chin, and the sides of neck are rusty tan. The wattles and orbital skin are both yellow in colour, and the ruff or cape is light orange. The upper back is green and the rest of the back and rump is golden-yellow. The tertiaries are blue whereas the scapulars are dark red. Other characteristics of the male plumage are the central tail feathers, black spotted with cinnamon, as well as the tip of the tail being a cinnamon buff. The upper tail coverts are the same colour as the central tail feathers. The male also has a scarlet breast, and scarlet and light chestnut flanks and underparts. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow. The female (hen) is much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage similar to that of the female common pheasant. She is darker and more slender than the hen of that species, with a proportionately shorter tail (half her length). The female's breast and sides are barred buff and blackish brown, and the abdomen is plain buff. She has a buff face and throat. Some abnormal females may later in their lifetime get some male plumage. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow. Both males and females have yellow legs and yellow bills. They feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but they roost in trees at night. During winter, flocks tend to forage close to human settlements at the edge of forest, taking primarily wheat leaves and seeds.Wu, Bao-Hua, and Xiao-Ping Yu Tao Li. \\"Winter Diet and Digestive Tract of the Golden Pheasant (Chrysolophus Pictus) in the Qinling Mountains, China\\".

While they can fly clumsily in short bursts, they prefer to run and spend most of their time on the ground. If startled, they can suddenly burst upwards at great speed and with a distinctive wing sound. Golden pheasants lay 8 to 12 eggs at a time and will then incubate these for around 22‚Äì23 days. They tend to eat berries, grubs, seeds and other types of vegetation. The male has a metallic call in the breeding season. The golden pheasant is commonly found in zoos and aviaries, but often as hybrid specimens that have the similar Lady Amherst's pheasant in their lineage. There are also different mutations of the golden pheasant known from birds in captivity, including the dark-throated, yellow, cinnamon, salmon, peach, splash, mahogany and silver. In aviculture, the wild type is referred to as \\"red-golden\\" to differentiate it from these mutations.

He was a member of the Republican Party, and a congressman for one term, 1993‚Äì1995, from California. Huffington was married to Arianna Huffington, the Greek-born co-founder of HuffPost, from 1986 to 1997.  Early years  Huffington was born in Dallas, Texas, to Celeste Phyllis (Gough) and Roy Michael Huffington, the founder of the natural gas exploration company, Roy M. Huffington, Inc. (HUFFCO). In 1965, Huffington graduated from Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana, where he received the Central States Amateur Rowing Association Medal when he rowed on the light weight crew. After graduation he was elected to the Culver Chapter of the Cum Laude Society. In 1970, he received a BS degree in engineering and a BA degree in economics concurrently from Stanford University. Huffington was a member of the varsity crew, student senator, and co-president of his senior class. In 1972, he received an MBA in finance from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Huffington's wealth is derived from a merchant bank he started and his share of the family's Houston oil, gas and real estate firm that was sold to Taiwan interests in 1990. His father, Roy M. Huffington, made a fortune through natural gas interests in Indonesia.  Politics  Huffington's interest in politics began in 1968, when he was a summer intern in Washington, D.C. for freshman Congressman George H. W. Bush. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed Huffington as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiations Policy, with responsibility for conventional arms control negotiations. He was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. In 1992, Huffington was elected to the House of Representatives from California's 22nd District (Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties). He spent a record $5.4 million on his campaign, 95% of it his own money. He spent about $3.5 million in the Republican primary, in which he defeated veteran incumbent Robert J. Lagomarsino. Huffington later defeated then Santa Barbara County Supervisor, Gloria Ochoa, in the general election. He donated his entire congressional salary to the Partnership for Children of Santa Barbara County in 1993, and to the Partnership for Children of San Luis Obispo County in 1994. In 1994, after one term in the House, Huffington spent $28 million in a bid for the seat in the United States Senate held by Dianne Feinstein. She had won the seat in a special election two years earlier against John F. Seymour, who has been appointed in 1991 to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Governor-elect Pete Wilson. In the Republican primary, Huffington defeated William E. Dannemeyer. At the time, Huffington's campaign was the most expensive in a non-presidential election in American history. He lost to Feinstein in the general election by 1.9 percent of the vote.1994 United States Senate election in California During 1998, Huffington was co-chairman (with actor and director Rob Reiner) of Proposition 10 in California, which increased the state excise tax on cigarettes by 50 cents per pack. The resulting multi-hundred million dollars of tax revenue was used for prenatal care and for the health care and education of children under six years of age. In the 2003 California recall election, Huffington endorsed Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. His ex-wife, Arianna Huffington, was an opposing candidate. She withdrew before the election, although her name remained on the ballot. On June 29, 2006, Huffington co-chaired the Log Cabin Republicans \\"The Courage To Lead: An Evening With The Governor\\" dinner that honored California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Huffington also personally contributed $1 for every $2 contributed to the Log Cabin Republicans (a 501(c)(4) tax designated organization) for that dinner. In 2006, Huffington became the director of It's My Party Too, a group founded by former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. A moderate Republican organization with libertarian leanings, it advocated fiscal conservatism, social progressivism, environmental protection and limited government interference in personal matters. In 2007, It's My Party Too evolved into the Republican Leadership Council.Welcome to the Republican Leadership Council!  Republican Leadership Council In 2013, Huffington was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief in support of same-sex marriage, submitted to the Supreme Court during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.  Personal life  Huffington married Arianna Huffington, a Greek-born writer and lecturer, on April 12, 1986. They had two daughters and divorced in 1997. In December 2006, he became a blogger for The Huffington Post, which was co-founded by his ex-wife in 2005. Huffington publicly disclosed that he is bisexual in 1998. Since that time, Huffington has made a number of contributions to LGBT causes. Later that year, he provided the initial grant that launched SOIN (Sexual Orientation Issues in the News)Sexual Orientation Issues in the News - Gay Issues Media Press Coverage Journalism Education Lesbian Homosexual LGBT Annenberg USC at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication. Then in 2005, Huffington helped to establish a summer fellowship program for LGBT students at Stanford University.Stanford Pride He also spoke at the National Equality March rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on October 11, 2009. According to a 2004 Los Angeles Times interview, Huffington is celibate. Huffington was raised Presbyterian, became Episcopalian at age 38, and ultimately joined the Greek Orthodox Church in 1996 after a visit to Istanbul, Turkey. Between 2007 and 2012, Huffington gave $2.5 million to establish the Huffington Ecumenical Institute at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, in order to promote dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Concerning the Institute's mission, Huffington said, \\"My dream is that someday I'll get to see members of the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church be able to take communion in each other's churches.\\"  Film production  Huffington found a post-political career as a film producer. From 1991 to 2000, he was co-owner of Crest Films Limited. Among his other production credits: * Huffington was an executive producer of Hold Me Down, a 2017 American drama short film about the struggles of a 19-year-old single mother in The Bronx, written and directed by Niclas Gillis. * Huffington was a financial contributor to Out of the Past,Out of the Past (1998) a documentary that won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998. * Huffington executive produced three short films at the University of Southern California: \\"The Promise\\" in 1998,The Promise (1998) - Full cast and crew \\"Lost and Found\\" in 1999, and \\"Nuclear Family\\" in 2000. * He was an executive producer of the 2000 television series, The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne. * He was an executive producer of the 2007 AFI film Santa Croce, which was distributed worldwide on through the iTunes Store and Shorts International. * He was an executive producer of For the Bible Tells Me So, a documentary that premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. * He was an executive producer of A Jihad for Love,A JIHAD FOR LOVE:::A Film by Parvez Sharma a documentary that premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. * He was executive producer of We're All Angels, a 2007 documentary about gay Christian pop singers Jason and deMarco, which premiered on Showtime on June 12, 2008.Showtime : Schedules : Daily Schedule * He was an executive producer of Bi the Way, a documentary about bisexuality in America that premiered at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. * He was an executive producer of American Primitive, which premiered at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival. * He was a producer of Father vs. Son, a comedy that premiered at WorldFest 2010 and won The Houston Film Critics Society Award for Best World Premiere ‚Äì Feature Films. *He was a producer of Dissolution, which premiered at the 2010 Jerusalem International Film Festival and won the Best Drama Award. *He was a producer of After The Fire directed by Gudio Verweyen, inspired by the Pulitzer Prize story and New York Times bestseller After The Fire by Robin G.

The northeast blackout of 1965 was a significant disruption in the supply of electricity on Tuesday, November 9, 1965, affecting parts of Ontario in Canada and Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont in the United States. Over 30 million people and 80,000 square miles (207,000 km2) were left without electricity for up to 13 hours. Cause The cause of the failure was the setting of a protective relay on one of the transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. The safety relay was set to trip if other protective equipment deeper within the Ontario Hydro system failed to operate properly. On a particularly cold November evening, power demands for heating, lighting, and cooking were pushing the electrical system to near its peak capacity. Transmission lines heading into southern Ontario were heavily loaded. The safety relay had been misprogrammed, and it did what it had been asked to do: to disconnect under the loads it perceived. As a result, at 5:16 p.m. Eastern Time, a small variation of power originating from the Robert Moses generating plant in Lewiston, New York caused the relay to trip, disabling a main power line heading into Southern Ontario. Instantly, the power that was flowing on the tripped line transferred to the other lines, causing them to become overloaded. Their own protective relays, which are also designed to protect the lines from overload, tripped, isolating Beck Station from all of southern Ontario.Report of The Northeast Power co-ordinating Council (NPCC) With nowhere else to go, the excess power from Beck Station then flowed east, over the interconnected lines into New York state, overloading them as well, and isolating the power generated in the Niagara region from the rest of the interconnected grid. The Beck generators, with no outlet for their power, were automatically shut down to prevent damage. The Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant continued to generate power, which supplied Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation customers in the metropolitan areas of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York. These areas ended up being isolated from the rest of the Northeast power grid and remained powered up. The Niagara Mohawk Western NY Huntley (Buffalo) and Dunkirk steam plants were knocked offline.Buffalo Evening News, November 10, 1965 Within five minutes, the power distribution system in the Northeast was in chaos as the effects of overloads and the subsequent loss of generating capacity cascaded through the network, breaking the grid into \\"islands\\". Station after station experienced load imbalances and automatically shut down. The affected power areas were the Ontario Hydro System, St Lawrence-Oswego, Upstate New York, and New England. With only limited electrical connection southwards, power to the southern states was not affected. The only part of the Ontario Hydro System not affected was the Fort Erie area next to Buffalo, which was still powered by older 25 Hz generators. Residents in Fort Erie were able to pick up a TV broadcast from New York, where a local backup generator was being used for transmission purposes. Radio An aircheck of New York City radio station WABC from November 9, 1965 reveals disc jockey Dan Ingram doing a segment of his afternoon drive time show, during which he noted that a record he was playing (Jonathan King's \\"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\\") sounded slow, as did the subsequent jingles played during a commercial break. Ingram quipped that the King record \\"was in the key of R.\\" The station's music playback equipment used AC motors whose speed was dependent on the frequency of the powerline, normally 60 Hz. Comparisons of segments of the hit songs played at the time of the broadcast, minutes before the blackout happened, in this aircheck, as compared to the same song recordings played at normal speed reveal that approximately six minutes before blackout the line frequency was 56 Hz, and just two minutes before the blackout that frequency dropped to 51 Hz. As Si Zentner's recording of \\"(Up a) Lazy River\\" plays in the background - again at a slower-than-normal tempo - Ingram mentions that the lights in the studio are dimming, then suggests that the electricity itself is slowing down, adding, \\"I didn't know that could happen\\". When the station's Action Central News report comes on at 5:25 pm ET, the staff remains oblivious to the impending blackout. The lead story is still Roger Allen LaPorte's self-immolation at United Nations Headquarters earlier that day to protest American military involvement in the Vietnam War; a taped sound bite with the attending physician plays noticeably slower and lower than usual. The newscast gradually fizzles out as power is lost by the time newscaster Bill Rice starts delivering the second story about New Jersey Senator Clifford P. Case's comments on his home state's recent gubernatorial election. Unaffected areas Some areas within the affected region were not blacked out. Municipal utilities in Hartford, Connecticut; Braintree, Holyoke, and Taunton, Massachusetts; and Fairport, Greenport, and Walden, New York had their own power plants, which operators disconnected from the grid and which were able to sustain local loads, though some areas lost power for at least a few hours. In New York City, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn were spared when Con Edison disconnected its Arthur Kill Generating Station from the grid. Rochdale, Queens was also unaffected as it had its own power plant. Effect and aftermath New York City was dark by 5:27 p.m. The blackout was not universal in the city; some neighborhoods never lost power. Also, some suburban areas, including Bergen County, New Jersey - served by PSE&G; \\\\- did not lose power. Most of the television stations in the New York metro area were forced off the air, as well as about half the FM radio stations, as their common transmitter tower atop the Empire State Building lost power. Fortunately, a bright full moon lit up the cloudless sky over the entire blackout area,http://www.fullmoon.info/en/fullmoon-calendar/1965.html providing some aid for the millions who were suddenly plunged into darkness. Most telephones remained operational, the telephone exchanges powered by emergency generators. However, not all emergency generators functioned as desired. The generator at Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse failed to start, creating a serious crisis and forcing surgeons to complete operations in progress by flashlight. Power restoration was uneven. Most generators had no auxiliary power to use for startup. Parts of Brooklyn were repowered by 11:00pm, the rest of the borough by midnight. However, the entire city was not returned to normal power supply until nearly 7:00 a.m. the next day, November 10. Power in western New York was restored in a few hours, thanks to the Genesee River-powered generating plant in Rochester, which stayed online throughout the blackout. Like starting a car, to start or restart a generator requires power for a starter motor (see black start). The availability of this hydroelectric power was crucial; it was used to restart dead generators, which then could provide power to restart other generators, in a cascading process which required much switching by engineers at the various plants. The Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center saw the first full-scale activation of the facility during the blackout. The New York Times was able to produce a ten-page edition for November 10, using the printing presses of a nearby paper that was not affected, the Newark Evening News. The front page showed a photograph of the city skyline with its lights all out. Following the blackout, measures were undertaken to try to prevent a repetition. Reliability councils were formed to establish standards, share information, and improve coordination amongst electricity providers. Ten councils were created covering the four networks of the North American Interconnected Systems. The Northeast Power Coordinating Council covered the area affected by the 1965 blackout. The task force that investigated the blackout found that a lack of voltage and current monitoring was a contributing factor to the blackout, and recommended improvements. The Electric Power Research Institute helped the electric power industry develop new metering and monitoring equipment and systems, which have become the modern SCADA systems in use today. A poster placed in the New York City Subway thanking riders for staying on their best behavior during the blackout. It states \\"When the lights went out you were at your brightest.\\" In contrast to the wave of looting and other incidents that took place during the 1977 New York City blackout, only five reports of looting were made in New York City after the 1965 blackout. It was said to be the lowest amount of crime on any night in the city's history since records were first kept. However more than 800000 riders were trapped in the subway. Reports about an alleged baby boom that followed the blackout nine months later are considered unsubstantiated. Immediately following the outage, R&B; group The Ad Libs released a single about the incident, titled \\"New York In the Dark\\", on the AGP Records label. It included lines such as \\"The people they were frantic, although they didn't panic, they kept on singing songs, until the lights came on again\\" and \\"And the moon was shinin' through that 'ole silver silver linin'\\".

In this technique, which call ‚Äúone of the most important tools in combinatorics,‚Äù one describes a finite set X from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set. Since both expressions equal the size of the same set, they equal each other. Examples =Multiplication (of natural numbers) commutes= This is a simple example of double counting, often used when teaching multiplication to young children. In this context, multiplication of natural numbers is introduced as repeated addition, and is then shown to be commutative by counting, in two different ways, a number of items arranged in a rectangular grid. Suppose the grid has n rows and m columns. We first count the items by summing n rows of m items each, then a second time by summing m columns of n items each, thus showing that, for these particular values of n and m, n \\\\times m = m \\\\times n. While not a proof, it clearly shows that multiplication commutes, for any example (of a practical size) we choose. =Forming committees= One example of the double counting method counts the number of ways in which a committee can be formed from n people, allowing any number of the people (even zero of them) to be part of the committee. That is, one counts the number of subsets that an n-element set may have. One method for forming a committee is to ask each person to choose whether or not to join it. Each person has two choices ‚Äì yes or no ‚Äì and these choices are independent of those of the other people. Therefore there are 2 √ó 2 √ó ... √ó 2 = 2n possibilities. Alternatively, one may observe that the size of the committee must be some number between 0 and n. For each possible size k, the number of ways in which a committee of k people can be formed from n people is the binomial coefficient :{n \\\\choose k}. Therefore the total number of possible committees is the sum of binomial coefficients over k = 0, 1, 2, ... n. Equating the two expressions gives the identity : \\\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\\\choose k} = 2^n, a special case of the binomial theorem. A similar double counting method can be used to prove the more general identity :\\\\sum_{k=d}^n {n\\\\choose k}{k\\\\choose d} = 2^{n-d}{n\\\\choose d} (; ). =Handshaking lemma= Another theorem that is commonly proven with a double counting argument states that every undirected graph contains an even number of vertices of odd degree. That is, the number of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges must be even. In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people's hands; for this reason, the result is known as the handshaking lemma. To prove this by double counting, let d(v) be the degree of vertex v. The number of vertex-edge incidences in the graph may be counted in two different ways: by summing the degrees of the vertices, or by counting two incidences for every edge. Therefore : \\\\sum_v d(v) = 2e where e is the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of the vertices is therefore an even number, which could not happen if an odd number of the vertices had odd degree. This fact, with this proof, appears in the 1736 paper of Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg that first began the study of graph theory. =Counting trees= Cayley's formula implies that there is tree on two vertices, trees on three vertices, and trees on four vertices. Adding a directed edge to a rooted forest What is the number Tn of different trees that can be formed from a set of n distinct vertices? Cayley's formula gives the answer . list four proofs of this fact; they write of the fourth, a double counting proof due to Jim Pitman, that it is ‚Äúthe most beautiful of them all.‚Äù Pitman's proof counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on n vertices to form from it a rooted tree. One way to form such a sequence is to start with one of the Tn possible unrooted trees, choose one of its n vertices as root, and choose one of the possible sequences in which to add its (directed) edges. Therefore, the total number of sequences that can be formed in this way is . Another way to count these edge sequences is to consider adding the edges one by one to an empty graph, and to count the number of choices available at each step. If one has added a collection of edges already, so that the graph formed by these edges is a rooted forest with k trees, there are choices for the next edge to add: its starting vertex can be any one of the n vertices of the graph, and its ending vertex can be any one of the roots other than the root of the tree containing the starting vertex. Therefore, if one multiplies together the number of choices from the first step, the second step, etc., the total number of choices is :\\\\prod_{k=2}^{n} n(k-1) = n^{n-1} (n-1)! = n^{n-2} n!. Equating these two formulas for the number of edge sequences results in Cayley's formula: :\\\\displaystyle T_n n!=n^{n-2}n! and :\\\\displaystyle T_n=n^{n-2}. As Aigner and Ziegler describe, the formula and the proof can be generalized to count the number of rooted forests with k trees, for any k.

Oard. \\"Matching meaning for cross-language information retrieval.\\" Information Processing & Management48.4 (2012): 631-53. The term \\"cross-language information retrieval\\" has many synonyms, of which the following are perhaps the most frequent: cross-lingual information retrieval, translingual information retrieval, multilingual information retrieval. The term \\"multilingual information retrieval\\" refers more generally both to technology for retrieval of multilingual collections and to technology which has been moved to handle material in one language to another. The term Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) involves the study of systems that accept queries for information in various languages and return objects (text, and other media) of various languages, translated into the user's language. Cross- language information retrieval refers more specifically to the use case where users formulate their information need in one language and the system retrieves relevant documents in another. To do so, most CLIR systems use various translation techniques.\\"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.

Web. Other related information access tasks, such as media monitoring, information filtering and routing, sentiment analysis, and information extraction require more sophisticated models and typically more processing and analysis of the information items of interest. Much of that processing needs to be aware of the specifics of the target languages it is deployed in. Mostly, the various mechanisms of variation in human language pose coverage challenges for information retrieval systems: texts in a collection may treat a topic of interest but use terms or expressions which do not match the expression of information need given by the user. This can be true even in a mono-lingual case, but this is especially true in cross-lingual information retrieval, where users may know the target language only to some extent. The benefits of CLIR technology for users with poor to moderate competence in the target language has been found to be greater than for those who are fluent. Specific technologies in place for CLIR services include morphological analysis to handle inflection, decompounding or compound splitting to handle compound terms, and translations mechanisms to translate a query from one language to another. The first workshop on CLIR was held in Z√ºrich during the SIGIR-96 conference.The proceedings of this workshop can be found in the book Cross-Language Information Retrieval (Grefenstette, ed; Kluwer, 1998) . Workshops have been held yearly since 2000 at the meetings of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF).

Technically, a carrier wave may still be transmitting; in radio, the result is silence, and in television, the result is a silent black image.

Broadcast regulations In the US, dead air, if prolonged and occurring without permission, is an actionable offense that can result in fines from the FCC. Broadcast stations can use programmable devices known as \\"silence sensors\\", \\"off air alarms\\" or \\"silence monitors\\" that will sound an alarm and alert personnel if dead air persists more than a few seconds.Jonathan Kern.

Examples On September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set of the CBS Evening News when a late running U.S. Open tennis match threatened to delay the start of his news broadcast. The match then ended sooner than expected but Rather was gone. The network broadcast six minutes of dead air before Rather was found and returned to the studio. CBS affiliates criticized Rather for the incident. One significant case of dead air occurred during Super Bowl LII in 2018, when the NBC television broadcast experienced 26 seconds of dead air during a commercial break. The network blamed \\"a brief equipment failure\\", and stated that no commercial advertising was lost. Prior to Super Bowl XLV, Green Bay radio station WCHK-FM announced that it would intentionally go to dead air during the game, since the hometown Packers were playing in the game. When British Virgin Radio host Chris Evans did not arrive for work on time resulting in Vanessa Feltz filling in for 30 minutes until Evans took the microphone. The Guardian characterized it as a promotional stunt that forced Feltz \\"to fill the dead air with jokes\\". French public broadcasting network Radio France automatically broadcasts a musical loop (called emergency program) in the event of dead air lasting more than a few seconds. This program is broadcast in the event of unscheduled interruption (due to a fire in the building or technical issues), as well as during programmed blackouts caused by strikes of technicians, journalists, and producers. During such blackouts (which can last for weeks ), a pre-recorded message will inform listeners that no service is available due industrial action.

Reed and artist Christopher Shy joined forces to create Ronin Arts as a new company to highlight their talents. The first version of the web site sold both Reed's 101 books along with illustrated art books like Shy's edition of H.P. Lovecraft's Herbert West: Reanimator (2003). That same year, Ronin Arts expanded beyond their d20 collections by purchasing Pariah Press' The Whispering Vault and Pacesetter's Star Ace. They started producing new Whispering Vault material almost immediately, beginning with Ronin Publishing's previously unpublished Mortal Magic (2003), but, after several more PDFs in 2003, that line ceased. Reed had intended to convert Star Ace to d20 modern but never completed the task. Ronin Arts was doing so well that in 2004 Reed left his day job at Steve Jackson Games to work on the company full-time. Around the same time, new freelancers such as Bruce Baugh, Michael Hammes, James Maliszewski and Patrick Younts began writing for Ronin Arts. Ronin Arts has produced material for other licensed systems, publishing the \\"Runic Fantasy\\" series for Mongoose Publishing's RuneQuest (2006-2007), the \\"First Edition Fantasy\\" series for AD&D; retroclone, OSRIC (2006-2007), and supplements for Mutants & Masterminds (2003-2008). Hammes and Reed wrote 4C System (2007), the retroclone to TSR's Marvel Super Heroes system, which then attracted supplements by Hazard Studio, Highmoon Games, Seraphim Guard and others. Ronin Arts also published one of the few early Freeport licenses, Treasures of Freeport (2004) and thereafter produced a handful of True20 supplements (2005-2006) and a long series of Mutants & Masterminds Archetype books (2006-2007) which were sold directly by Green Ronin. In 2006 Reed was able to successfully sell an extended series of PDFs called ePublishing 101 which recounted how to make PDF production work. By 2007, the PDF market had cooled considerably and Reed decided to go back to work at Steve Jackson Games, and in 2008 he became Chief Operating Officer of the company. Ronin Arts began as an experiment, when Reed wrote the company's first PDF 101 Spellbooks. Surprised by how quickly the gaming community embraced the product, he quickly set out to produce more. The company soon made its products available at RPGNOW.com, one of the first sites to exclusively handle the sale and promotion of roleplaying games in electronic format. From 2003 to 2007 at least, Ronin Arts was considered one of the most successful publishers in the emerging PDF industry. In February 2007, however, they ended their relationship with RPGNOW due to creative differences. As of March 2015, Ronin Arts' website is no longer active, having apparently been let go as of late 2012 or early 2013.

Formulation  The necklace problem involves the reconstruction of a necklace of n beads, each of which is either black or white, from partial information. The information specifies how many copies the necklace contains of each possible arrangement of k black beads. For instance, for k=2, the specified information gives the number of pairs of black beads that are separated by i positions, for i=0,\\\\dots \\\\lfloor n/2-1 \\\\rfloor . This can be made formal by defining a k-configuration to be a necklace of k black beads and n-k white beads, and counting the number of ways of rotating a k-configuration so that each of its black beads coincides with one of the black beads of the given necklace. The necklace problem asks: if n is given, and the numbers of copies of each k-configurations are known up to some threshold k\\\\le K, how large does the threshold K need to be before this information completely determines the necklace that it describes? Equivalently, if the information about k-configurations is provided in stages, where the kth stage provides the numbers of copies of each k-configuration, how many stages are needed (in the worst case) in order to reconstruct the precise pattern of black and white beads in the original necklace?  Upper bounds  Alon, Caro, Krasikov and Roditty showed that 1 + log2(n) is sufficient, using a cleverly enhanced inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle. Radcliffe and Scott showed that if n is prime, 3 is sufficient, and for any n, 9 times the number of prime factors of n is sufficient. Pebody showed that for any n, 6 is sufficient and, in a followup paper, that for odd n, 4 is sufficient. He conjectured that 4 is again sufficient for even n greater than 10, but this remains unproven.

In the original code, the player can press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects: The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles, and is present as an Easter egg in a number of websites. History The code was first used in the 1986 release of Gradius, a scrolling shooter for the NES and was popularized among North American players in the NES version of Contra, for which it was also dubbed both the \\"Contra Code\\" and \\"30 Lives Code\\", due to its near necessity in-game. The Konami Code was created by Kazuhisa Hashimoto who was developing the home port of the 1985 arcade game Gradius for the NES. Finding the game too difficult to play through during testing, he created a cheat code to give the player a full set of power-ups (normally attained gradually throughout the game). After entering the sequence using the controller when the game was paused the player received all available power-ups. The code was meant to be removed prior to publishing, but this was overlooked and discovered as the game was being prepared for mass production. The developers decided to leave it there, as removing it could result in new bugs and glitches. The sequence was easy enough to remember for testers and simultaneously sufficiently hard to enter accidentally during the gameplay for unsuspecting users. The Konami Code was thus included in the series' other sequels and spin-offs, with some key differences: * In the Super NES version of Gradius III, the original code destroys the player's ship. However, replacing and with the and triggers of the SNES controller powers up the ship. * In the most recent iteration of the series‚ÄîGradius Rebirth on the Wii‚Äîthe Wii Remote's and buttons fill in for and , respectively. The code has been subsequently re-used in a large number of other games and a varied version of the code is now used in the Opera Browser to activate hidden advanced settings. Variations of the Konami Code The original version of the cheat code was designed for the NES controller. The exact sequence varies from game to game and has been adapted to fit the button layouts of different video game consoles, mostly the and buttons. For example: * Any code for a PlayStation controller, which uses shapes instead of letters, would use \\", \\", appearing even in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution series, input on the dance pad. * In mobile phone games by Konami, they are replaced by on the numerical pad, which is the goroawase pronunciation for \\"konami\\"; 5 is pronounced go, 7 can be pronounced nana or just na for short, and 3 is usually pronounced as 'san' but has an alternative pronunciation of 'mi'. Together, this becomes ko-na-mi. * 573 is also used extensively in the Dance Dance Revolution series; the original board for DDR 1stMIX (also used in many other Konami designs) was called System 573, the maximum combo in several difficult songs (such as MAX 300) is 573, high scores often start out at 573 000 or similar, and so on. These deviations may occur for purely operational reasons (e.g., if the code must be entered while the game is paused, the code might be altered to avoid resuming), to keep powerful upgrades better concealed while still referencing Konami, or through a programming error. Despite the differences, though, these codes are still often referred to in general discussion as \\"Konami Code\\", \\"Conami Kode\\", or, less commonly, \\"Pseudo-Konami Code\\". A common misconception is that the code ends with Start or Select Start. In many titles, the player must press Start after entering the code in order to start a game, or press Select to switch to two-player mode and then start the game, leading to the confusion.

PƒÅli is the language in which the texts of the Theravada school of Buddhism are preserved. The PƒÅli texts are the oldest collection of Buddhist scriptures preserved in the language in which they were written down. The society first compiled, edited, and published Latin script versions of a large corpus of PƒÅli literature, including the PƒÅli Canon, as well as commentarial, exegetical texts, and histories. It publishes translations of many PƒÅli texts. It also publishes ancillary works including dictionaries, concordances, books for students of PƒÅli and a journal. History Thomas William Rhys Davids was one of three British civil servants who were posted to Sri Lanka, in the 19th century, the others being George Turnour, and Robert Caesar Childers (1838‚Äì1876). At this time Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was struggling under the weight of foreign rule and intense missionary activity by Christians. It was an administrative requirement that all civil servants should be familiar with the language, literature, and culture of the land in which they were posted, so the three men studied with several scholar monks where, along with an introduction to Sinhala culture and language, they became interested in Buddhism. The PƒÅli Text Society was founded on the model of the Early English Text Society with Rhys Davids counting on support from a lot of European scholars and Sri Lankan scholar monks. The work of bringing out the Roman text editions of the PƒÅli Canon was not financially rewarding, but was achieved with the backing of the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka who underwrote the printing costs. Childers published the first PƒÅli-English dictionary in 1874. This was superseded in 1925 by the new dictionary which had largely been compiled by T. W. Rhys Davids over 40 years, but was finished by his student William Stede. Currently another dictionary is being compiled by Margaret Cone, with the first of three volumes (A - Kh) published in 2001. By 1922, when T. W. Rhys Davids died, the PƒÅli Text Society had issued 64 separate texts in 94 volumes exceeding 26,000 pages, as well a range of articles by English and European scholars.  Fragile Palm Leaves  In 1994 the PƒÅli Text Society inaugurated the Fragile Palm Leaves project, an attempt to catalogue and preserve Buddhist palm-leaf manuscripts from Southeast Asia. Prior to the introduction of printing presses and Western papermaking technology, texts in Southeast Asia‚Äîincluding the Pali scriptures‚Äîwere preserved by inscription on specially preserved leaves from palm trees. The leaves were then bound together to create a complete manuscript. While palm-leaf manuscripts have likely been in use since before the 5th century CE, existing examples date from the 18th century and later, with the largest number having been created during the 19th century.The Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation Because of the materials used and the tropical climate, manuscripts from earlier eras are generally not found intact in palm-leaf form, and many manuscripts have been badly damaged. During the colonial era, many palm-leaf manuscripts were disassembled and destroyed, with individual pages of texts being sold as decorative objets d'art to Western collectors. The PƒÅli Text Society created the Fragile Palm Leaves project to collect, catalogue, and preserve these artifacts, including scanning them into electronic formats in order to make them available to researchers without threatening their preservation. In 2001 the project was formalised as a nonprofit in Thailand as the Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation.

Old Finland was joined to the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland as Viipuri province in 1812. *In the Treaty of Nystad (1721) that concluded the Great Northern War, Sweden was forced to cede K√§kisalmi County and Viborg/Viipuri County to Russia. The ceded Finnish-speaking Ingria around Saint Petersburg, however, was not included in Old Finland. *In the Treaty of √Öbo (1743) Sweden had to cede the areas in southern Karelia east of the Kymi river and around Savonlinna to Russia. The area corresponded largely with that of the medieval province subjugated to Viipuri castle. The Russian ruler guaranteed religion, property rights, old Swedish laws, and some privileges to the inhabitants of these territories. However, a circumvention occurred, as the Russian administrators and Russian military were unfamiliar with the Swedish system. The Russians were used to a different system with its enslaved peasants, serfdom. As a result, the economy of the area was markedly different from that on the other side of the border. The ruler's guarantee froze the situation. Thus legal developments in Sweden were not introduced to these areas: the Viipuri and K√§kisalmi territory did not adopt the 1734 General Law of Sweden (though Hamina (Fredrikshamn), Lappeenranta (Villmanstrand), and Savonlinna (Nyslott), at the time still Swedish, of course did adopt it), and the new constitution of King Gustav III was not implemented in the entire area. The territories enjoyed a sort of autonomy and much particularism, since the Russian rulers applied similar principles here as in the Baltic Provinces. The administration resembled a German principality, rather than a Russian province. Under Russian rule the combined territories formed the Vyborg Governorate, or Government of Vyborg. Ecclesiastically, the areas were administered as a diocese, but without a bishop. The church building in Viipuri and another in Hamina were assigned as cathedrals, with a diocesan chapter (\\"consistory\\"), led by the archdean. The area was not forced to contribute men to the Russian Army until 1797. However, there were many non- Finnish troops in the area, especially after the 1788‚Äì90 war. Scandinavian- style district courts continued in judicial function, each with a judge and lay members. However, the Russian estate owners and military often ignored these courts' decisions and imposed illegal punishments on the peasants. Because of the absence of an evenly applied, up-to-date legal system in the area, apathy in some ways dominated among Old Finland's residents; and not many figures from the area have a prominent place in history. Two of these are Maximilian von Alopeus and his brother David Alopaeus, born into a Finnish family in Viipuri and both later serving many posts in Imperial administration, including ambassador in some Central European countries. These areas, Government of Vyborg, were later referred to as Old Finland; and from the beginning of 1812, they were incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Finland, where the newly acquired provinces from Sweden were \\"New Finland\\". Basically, the population in these provinces came to receive the same legal system as the rest of the Grand Duchy, including its Constitution and General Law, although some privileges took time to implement. The so-called donated estates (owned by Russian noblemen) in Karelia were a headache resolved slowly by monetary compensation from the Grand Duchy's Treasury. This was a long lasting burden, as the last instance of compensation was not until the 1870s.

Named after King George III and initially laid out in 1781 but not developed for another twenty years, George Square is surrounded by architecturally important buildings including on the east side the palatial Municipal Chambers, also known as the City Chambers, whose foundation stone was laid in 1883, and on the west side by the Merchants House.Glasgow by Irene Maver, published in 2000http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSE00418&t;=2 Built by Glasgow Corporation the Chambers are the continuing headquarters of Glasgow City Council. Joseph Swan\`s panoramic engraving of 1829 shows the early development of the square and its surrounding buildingshttps://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01114&t;=2 . The square boasts an important collection of statues and monuments, including those dedicated to Robert Burns, James Watt, Sir Robert Peel and Sir Walter Scott. Historical development Medieval Glasgow had a large area of common pasture to the west and north of the city. Every day, the town herd took the cattle of the burghers along an unpaved road called Cow Lone which led from the Trongate's West Port to pasture on the common, then on to Cowcaddens where the cattle were milked in the evening before returning. Long narrow back gardens or riggs ran north from Trongate properties, forming the Langcroft area, and along its northern boundary Back Cow Lone provided an alternative route west from the High Street. Cow Lone ran north between the Meadowflat lands (to the west) and the Ramshorn croft, which was bounded to the north by Rottenrow lane, and on the east by Deanside Brae, down via Greyfriar's Wynd (Shuttle Street) to Candleriggs.Deanside Brae (now under the John Anderson Campus of the University of Strathclyde) sloped steeply down from the Rottenrow ridge to the Meadow-Well or Deanside Well, originally in a meadow. By 1862 the well was at 88 George Street, across from Shuttle Street ‚Äì These lands became George Hutcheson's property in 1609. Hutcheson's Hospital tried to lease areas to small crofts or gardeners but the ground was poor. In 1772 the city magistrates bought the lands of Ramshorn and Meadowflats. From 1750 wealth from tobacco, sugar and cotton brought rapid expansion westwards, with new streets laid out along the riggs, including Virginia Street in 1753 and Miller Street in 1762. Cow Lone, impassible in wet weather, was renamed Queen street after Queen Charlotte in 1766, and paved as far as the junction with Back Cow Lone, which in 1772 was straightened and renamed Ingram Street. In that year the town's surveyor, James Barrie (or Barry), produced a grid plan for the Ramshorn lands, similar to planned development in London and Craig's 1766 gridded plan for Edinburgh's New Town. Barrie produced another plan in 1781, and in 1782 Glasgow's council adopted a grid incorporating a large square. This provided \\"a regular plan to the line of the streets in which every purchaser was bound to keep\\", later extended over Meadowflats. In 1782 a house for two families was built in George Square, then there was a four year pause before rapid growth began. Directly in line with the projected extension of Queen Street, a large mansion was built around 1783 in grounds just south of Rottenrow lane as Bailie George Crawford's Lodging, later known as Glasgow House. Scott monument of 1837; to the right of centre, the three-storey townhouses of 1807‚Äì1818 became the North British Hotel, and had a storey added in 1905. Entrance to Queen Street Station, and the North British Hotel, now renamed the Millennium Hotel. George's square, as it was known initially, was named after King George III. New streets named after royalty included Hanover street and Frederick street. Around 1790 the developments north of Trongate became known as Glasgow's New Town (in post-1980 regeneration this general area was rebranded as the Merchant City). Between 1787 and the 1820s Georgian terraces were built around the perimeter of George's square. The west side (in line with Queen Street) was a three-storey high block of six tenements, North Centre section which had three entrances with passageways to turnpike stairs at the back for the upper flats. These \\"plain dwellings\\" were \\"the residences of many most respectable families\\", but were criticised as looking like soldier's barracks or a cotton mill. The east side was a two-storey high terrace of \\"comfortable dwelling-houses with a double flight of steps to the second storey\\". By 1807 a hotel occupied the south end of this terrace, it later became the George Hotel. On the south and north sides, terraces of large townhouses had three storeys above a basement lit by a sunken area fenced off from the pavement.Photos show both terraces 3 storeys + basement, as in Edinburgh: ‚Äì first photo shows terrace (3 storeys + basement) and GPO at corner plot As Glasgow historian James Denholm wrote of \\"George's square\\" in 1804, \\"The buildings here are very elegant, particularly those upon the north; which, from the beauty of the design, and taste displayed in the execution, surpass by far any other either in this city or in Scotland.\\" The north side was completed 1807‚Äì1818 with three imposing townhouses built between Queen Street and Hanover Street. James Ewing of Strathleven bought Glasgow House in 1815, its grounds became known as the \\"Queen Street Park\\". Crows nested in tall trees around his mansion, and he was nicknamed \\"Craw Ewing\\". The centre of George Square had been used as a tip for surplus soil and debris around a stagnant pool, it was enclosed with a paling fence and used for grazing sheep. The first statue, erected in 1819 on the south of the square facing Miller Street, commemorated Sir John Moore of Corunna.Glasgow Herald 2 July 1894 Bank of Scotland 1867‚Äì1870 on corner of St Vincent Place, Queen Street station roof of 1880. Bank of Scotland theme continued in extension 1874‚Äì1876, and Merchants' House 1874‚Äì1880. Two storeys added to Merchants' House 1907‚Äì1909, further unbalancing the symmetry. In 1825 the Corporation instructed Stewart Murray, the curator and landscape architect of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sandyford, to improve the square. He landscaped it with winding walks, trees and shrubs, fenced around with an iron railing. Flower shows were organised, held in tents. The centre spot was used to commemorate Sir Walter Scott with the first ever monument dedicated to him.http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=greenshields_j The 80 foot fluted Doric column of Giffnock \\"liver rock\\" sandstone was designed by the competition winning architect David Rhind,http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100331 who appointed John Greenshields to design the statue above, which was executed by John Ritchie. The monument was completed by 1837, some years before Scott was commemorated in Edinburgh. From March to July 1834 the Steam Carriage Company of Scotland ran an hourly service to Paisley from its terminus at the northeast corner of the square. In 1838 James Ewing sold Glasgow House to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, who demolished it and built their terminus in its grounds, with station buildings in Dundas Street. It opened in 1842, and was later named the Queen Street Station, with its main entrance a direct continuation of Queen Street. Several nearby houses were soon converted into accommodation for travellers. The Glasgow and Edinburgh Chop House and Commercial Lodgings, on the west side of the square, was taken over by George Cranston shortly before his daughter Kate Cranston was born in 1849. It was renamed the Edinburgh and Glasgow Hotel, and subsequently known as Cranston's Hotel. Around 1855 town houses on the north side of the square to were converted into The Royal, The Crown and The Queen's Hotel. The Cranstons, seeking to enlarge their premises, moved about 1860 into the Crow Hotel, third from the south end. Around 1866, after the two tenements at the south end were demolished, the Cranstons moved to the Crown Hotel on the north side of the square. Along the south side, terraces came into new uses or new buildings erected, including business use, manufacturing and tenements. Around 1863 Henry Monteith & Co. had Italian Renaissance-style offices built, probably designed by John Burnet. In 1865 the two southern tenements on the west side were demolished, and the Bank of Scotland's Italianate building designed by John Thomas Rochead was built in their place 1867‚Äì1870, followed in 1874‚Äì1876 by a matching extension taking up the central third of the block. The bank's elevation was reflected in the Merchants' House 1875‚Äì1880, but symmetry was unbalanced by its corner tower, and the later addition of two more storeys. Glasgow Corporation took over the management of George Square in 1862. When the Post Office foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales in 1878 the square\`s iron railings were removed, transverse walks formed, and flower beds introduced.Glasgow Herald 2 July 1894 The terrace of houses along the east side of the square was demolished in 1883 as the site for the Glasgow City Chambers, designed by the architect William Young. Its foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1883, and the building was completed in 1889. Layout of George Square, Glasgow circa 1900. The terrace built 1807‚Äì1818 between Queen Street and Hanover Street on the north side of the square became known as the Queen's Hotel. In 1905 it became the North British Railway company's North British Station Hotel, and the attic was converted into a fourth storey, under a mansard roof giving further accommodation. Since 1878 Kate Cranston had made a great success of her Tea Rooms. Following the death of her husband in 1917 she sold several of her assets, including the Willow Tearooms, and at the age of 68 settled herself in the North British which was now the last hotel in the square, looking over the sites of the hotels where she had been born and grew up. In 1933 she moved to a house where she was looked after by a lady companion, and she died on the 18th of April 1934. Following nationalisation, the hotel came under British Transport Hotels. The gable of Queen Street Station's curved glass roof remained visible above its main entrance until 1969 when a new building was constructed supported by columns over the entrance way: this subsequently became an extension to the hotel. In 1984 British Rail sold the hotel, which was now called the Copthorne Hotel, and in 1986 a ground floor conservatory was built along its frontage, extending out to the pavement of the square. It was subsequently renamed the Millennium Hotel, and is now a listed building, the only survivor of the original terraces around George Square. Major reconstruction of Queen Street Station has seen demolition of its buildings along George Square and round the corner to Dundas Street, construction of the new glazed entrance from George Square began in December 2018. The Millennium Hotel has put forward proposals for major works including new rooms to replace those which were above the station entrance. Prominent buildings Sir Walter Scott statue erected 1837, in front of the City Chambers which were completed in 1889. Today the east side of the square, linking North Frederick Street and South Frederick Street, is dominated by the ornate Glasgow City Chambers, designed by architect William Young, and completed in 1889. On the South side, linking Cochrane Street and St Vincent Place, the former General Post Office built in 1878 takes up the block between South Frederick Street and South Hanover Street. It was redeveloped into offices in 2007.The History of G1 Glasgow G1 George Square Glasgow The block between there and Queen Street has a Chicago-style office building, dating from 1924. The city's main Tourist Information Centre previously in the square is now in Buchanan Street. The North side, running along George Street towards the University of Strathclyde, has the entrance to Queen Street Station followed by a terrace of three townhouses built 1807‚Äì1818, then enlarged with an additional storey in 1905 as the North British Railway's Hotel (now the Millennium Hotel). To the east of North Hanover Street, George House was built in 1979 (replacing an older Georgian building) to provide extra office space for Glasgow City Council. It later became offices for professional firms. Queen Street, running parallel to the square's West side, was formerly a row of hotels and now features the Merchants House building for the guildry formed in 1603 to establish the rights, duties and privileges of the merchants and craftsmen of Glasgow. https://www.merchantshouse.org.uk/aboutusWestbourne Music perform regularly here in a series of Merchants Music, as do jazz ensembles and other instrumentalists.https://www.westbournemusic.org/ The building also houses the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, founded in 1783. Designed by John Burnet and opened in 1874, two storeys were added to the Merchants House by his son JJ Burnet in 1907 and are topped by a domed tower on which is perched the emblem of the House a ship on a globe, a reminder of the importance of sea trade to Glasgow's prosperity. The western side is also the location of the former Bank of Scotland building, and even more palatial buildings sweep round to St Vincent Place and Buchanan Street. Monuments and statues Statue of Robert Burns, George Square, Glasgow The eastern side of the square itself is flanked by two lawns and is also the site of the city's Cenotaph https://www.firstworldwarglasgow.co.uk/index.aspx?articleid=11674, which was designed by Sir John James Burnet and originally built to commemorate Glaswegians killed in the First World War. It was conceived in 1921, and unveiled in 1924 by Field Marshall Earl Haig. The column in the centre of the square celebrates author Sir Walter Scott. It was erected in 1837. Eleven of Glasgow's many other public statues are situated around the square: the only known equestrian statues of a young Queen Victoria 1854 in St Vincent Place at Buchanan Street and moved to George Square in 1866 beside her husband Prince Albert 1866 both sculpted by Carlo Marochetti, erected in 1865 and 1866 respectively; poets Robert Burns sculpted by George Edwin Ewing, 1877, and Thomas Campbell sculpted by William Bodie, 1877; inventor James Watt sculpted by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, 1832; chemist Thomas Graham sculpted by William Brodie, 1872; General Sir John Moore sculpted by John Flaxman, 1819, and Field Marshall Lord Clyde sculpted by John Henry Foley, 1868; and politicians William Ewart Gladstone sculpted by William Hamo Thornycroft, 1902, Robert Peel sculpted by John Mossman, 1859, and James Oswald sculpted by Carlo Marochetti., 1856 at Charing Cross and moved to George Square in 1875. http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/ In June 2020 the statue of Robert Peel was vandalised during a Black Lives Matter protest. The abbreviation A.C.A.B. and a hammer and sickle symbol were spray painted onto the monument.https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18502095.glasgow-statue-robert- peel---founder-british-police---vandalised Social history George Square is also a place for musical events, light shows, ceremonies, sporting celebrations, political gatherings, and for annual Remembrance Day parades. The square has often been the scene of political events and, protests. Perhaps the most famous was the Battle of George Square in 1919, when skilled engineers campaigning for a 40-hour working week held a rally. Although a crowd of over 100,000 is often claimed, contemporary sources put it at 20-25,000. The meeting descended into violence between the protesters and the police, with the riot act being read. The city's radical reputation, and the raising of the red flag by some present, made the Coalition government fear a Bolshevik revolution was afoot. The Sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military assistance. Ten thousand troops, mainly from Scotland, were deployed, although they did not arrive until the riot was over. Six tanks arrived the following Monday, but never left their depot in the Cattle Market. In February 2005, the square was closed to pedestrians for a two-month restoration project, including the replacement of the red asphalt concourse, and the cleaning of stone and the statues in the square, most notably that of Walter Scott. Scenes for the zombie movie World War Z were filmed in the square in August 2011, using the resemblance of buildings to Philadelphia's financial district. Plans to remove the greenspace and lease the area for temporary businesses and events has been controversial. In 2012 a campaign was started to restore the square to its previous state.Restore George Square website Future In 2012 Glasgow City Council voted to spend ¬£15m on a \\"makeover\\", of the square, in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, to make it \\"a place fit for the 21st Century\\".Private Eye No 1324, p.14, Nooks and Corners, 5‚Äì18 October 2012 The plans included removing all of the monuments and statues in the square, ostensibly for restoration. However, the council said that \\"it is possible\\" that the monuments \\"may not return to the square\\", but will rather be relocated to \\"an area of regeneration\\". Only one monument was certain to remain; the Cenotaph by Sir John James Burnet. On 9 January 2013, the six shortlisted designs were put on display to the public in a nearby gallery. All the designs featured at least half the statues returning, with many containing all 11. Each short-listed design also contained a water-feature, which public reaction has been highly critical of considering the typical weather Glasgow experiences. The competition proved highly controversial. In the face of public outrage the abandonment of the redevelopment planGlasgow Architecture George Square Competition was announced on the same day as the winning design (by John McAslan & Partners)e-architect John McAslan & Partners was announced.

Its capital is Mati, and it borders the province of Davao de Oro to the west, and Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur to the north. The province is the traditional homeland of the Mandaya and Kagan people. Davao Oriental is the easternmost province in the country with Pusan Point in the municipality of Caraga as the easternmost location. The Philippine Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean, faces Davao Oriental to the east. Part of the province lies on an unnamed peninsula that encloses the Davao Gulf to the west. The province is the top producer of coconut and copra in the country, earning the province the title Coconut Capital of the Philippines. It is also home to Mount Hamiguitan Wildlife Sanctuary, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Etymology The name of the province was derived from the word, Dabaw, of which the center was west of the province. History =Precolonial and Spanish periods= The present territory of Davao Oriental was covered by the historical region of Caraga, which was under the Sultanate of Maguindanao. The Spaniards established a permanent settlement in the region in 1591, and in 1844, the area was ceded by the Sultanate to Spain. An expedition was sent by the colonial government in Manila in 1847 to control the region, led by the Spaniard Jose Oyanguren, who settled in the town of Davao and organized the surrounding areas into the province of Nueva Guipozcoa in 1849. The province existed until 1858, when the politico-military commandancias of Davao and Bislig were created in its place. Bislig was incorporated into the District of Davao two years later. =American period= Davao province in 1918 encompassing the current provinces of Davao Region In 1903, the colonial American government created the Moro Province comprising several districts, one of which was Davao. The Moro province was converted in 1914 into the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and its component districts were made into independent provinces. =World War II= In 1942, the territory of what is now Davao Oriental was occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces. In 1945, beginning the Battle of Davao from the combined forces of the British, Australian, Dutch and the Filipino troops of the 6th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 106th, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was supported by the recognized Davaoe√±o guerrilla fighter units by the attack to the Japanese Imperial forces during the liberation in Eastern Davao or Eastern Davao Campaign until the end of the Second World War. =Independence= On July 1, 1967, through Republic Act No. 4867, the province of Davao was divided into three independent provinces, one of which was Davao Oriental. Geography Eastern coast showing Pujada Bay Davao Oriental covers a total area of occupying the eastern tip of the Davao Region in Mindanao. The province is bordered by Davao de Oro to the west, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur to the north, the Davao Gulf to the southwest, and the Philippine Sea to the east and southeast. The Eastern Pacific Cordillera mountain range encompasses the province. To the east of the range lie narrow strips of coastal areas, which feature several inlets and bays. The province encloses the Davao Gulf to the southwest. =Climate= Davao Oriental has a pronounced rainy season and a short dry season, with maximum rainfall occurring from November to January especially at coastal areas. =Administrative divisions= Davao Oriental comprises 10 municipalities and 1 city, all organized into 2 legislative districts. There are 183 barangays in the province. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table- layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border- collapse:collapse;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  City municipality ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  District ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=3  Population ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Density ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Coordinates - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- top:none;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  /km2 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background- color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Baganga  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1st   53,426     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  18  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Banaybanay  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   39,121     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  14  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Boston  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1st   12,670     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Caraga  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1st   36,912     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  17  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Cateel  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1st   38,579     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  16  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Governor Generoso  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   50,372     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  20  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Lupon  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2nd   61,723     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  21  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Manay  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1st   40,577     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  17  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -style=\\"background-color:#CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:#CCFFCC;border-right:0;\\"  Mati  style=\\"text-align:right;border-left:0;\\"  ‚Ä†  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   126,143     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  26  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background- color:initial;\\" colspan=2  San Isidro  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   32,424     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  16  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Tarragona  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1st   25,671     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  10  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=4 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Total ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  558,958 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  517,618 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  5,679.64 ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  183 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-style:italic;\\"  -class=\\"sortbottom\\" style=\\"background-color:#F2F2F2;border-top:double grey;line-height:1.3em;\\"  colspan=\\"13\\"  } Demographics The population of Davao Oriental in the was people, with a density of .

While native languages spoken in the province are Kagan and Mandaya, Cebuano is the dominant first language. Chavacano is spoken by a minority, while Tagalog and English are widely used in business, education, and government.

He was sometimes referred to simply as Marin Falier (Venetian rather than standard Italian) or Falieri. He was executed for attempting a coup d'etat. Early life The Execution of Marino Faliero, by Eug√®ne Delacroix (1827, Wallace Collection). Coat of arms of Marino Faliero Faliero was the son of Iacopo Marin and Beriola Loredan. He had an uncle of the same name with whom he is often confused. In 1315 Faliero was one of the three heads of the Council of Ten when it was punishing the organizers of the 1310 conspiracy by Bajamonte Tiepolo. Faliero continued as a member of the council until 1320 and held the office of chief and inquisitor several times. In 1320 he was charged with Andrea Michiel to organize the killing of Tiepolo and Pietro Querini, the only two leaders of the conspiracy still at large. In 1323 Faliero was appointed captain and bailiff of Negroponte. In 1326 he was again in Venice as a member of the Council of Ten, but the following year he left for Bologna on a mission to the prior of the Servites who had a dispute with Venice. Back again in the Ten, he left shortly after to be elected one of the Five Elders to Peace, another group of Venetian magistrates. After a few years of absence from public life, he reappears again in 1330 as a member of the Council of Ten. In 1333 he became captain of the galleys of the Major Sea and of Constantinople and protected the merchants going to Tanais in the Black Sea. Doge of Venice Faliero was a naval and military commander and then a diplomat before being elected doge in succession to Andrea Dandolo. He learned of his election while he was on a diplomatic mission to the papal court at Avignon. The populace of Venice was at that time disenchanted with the ruling aristocrats who were blamed for a recent naval defeat by the fleet of the Republic of Genoa at the 1354 Battle of Portolungo during the Third Venetian‚ÄìGenoese War.Grignola, p. 48 Within months of being elected, Faliero attempted a coup d'etat in April 1355, aiming to take effective power from the ruling aristocrats. According to tradition, this came about because the dogaressa, Faliero's second wife, Aluycia Gradenigo, had been insulted by Michele Steno, a member of an aristocratic family,Grignola, p. 49 but in a study of doges of Venice Antonella Grignola suggests that Faliero's move was consistent with a prevailing trend in Italian cities to move away from oligarchic government to absolute, dynastic rule. The plot was badly organised, with poor communication between the conspirators, and was quickly discovered. Faliero pleaded guilty to all charges and was beheaded on 17 April and his body mutilated. Ten additional ringleaders were hanged on display from the Doge's Palace in Piazza San Marco.Norwich, pp. 223‚Äì229  Legacy  Faliero's picture in the Great Council Hall. The black shroud painted in its place bears the Latin phrase, \\"This is the space for Marino Faliero, beheaded for crimes.\\" Faliero was condemned to damnatio memoriae, and accordingly his portrait displayed in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Doge's Palace was removed and the space painted over with a black shroud, which can still be seen in the hall today. A Latin language inscription on the painted shroud reads: Hic est locus Marini Faletro decapitati pro criminibus (\\"This is the space reserved for Marino Faliero, beheaded for his crimes\\"). The story of Faliero's failed plot was later made into plays by Lord Byron (in 1820) and Casimir Delavigne (in 1829).Lefevre, Carl. \\"Lord Byron's Fiery Convert of Revenge\\", Studies in Philology , Vol. 49, No. 3 (July 1952), pp. 468‚Äì487 The latter's version was adapted into an eponymous opera scored by Gaetano Donizetti in 1835.Ashbrook, William. \\"Marino Faliero\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Opera', Oxford Music Online, accessed 17 June 2012 All three present the traditional story that Faliero was acting to defend his wife's honour. Prussian author E. T. A. Hoffmann used a different approach in his 1818 novella Doge and Dogess; German composer Robert Schumann contemplated writing an opera based on Hoffmann's story. His home, Palazzo Falier, still exists in Venice, being one of the oldest structures there.  Notes   Bibliography   * *‚Äî (1893) \\"M. Faliero avanti ii Dogado,\\" ibid. *‚Äî (1897) \\"M.

Its capital is Nabunturan. It used to be part of the province of Davao del Norte until it was made a separate province in 1998. The province borders Davao del Norte to the west, Agusan del Sur to the north, and Davao Oriental to the east. To the southwest lies the Davao Gulf. The first elected governor was Jose Caballero, formerly a lawyer for a mining group in the province. The province was formerly known as Compostela Valley (; shortened as ComVal) from its inception until December 2019, when a plebiscite ratified the law that proposed to rename the province to Davao de Oro. History Davao de Oro, the 78th province in the country, was created out of Davao del Norte Province by virtue of Republic Act No. 8470, signed by President Fidel V. Ramos on January 30, 1998. The new province was officially named Compostela Valley. On March 7 of the same year, the law was ratified through a plebiscite conducted in the twenty-two (22) municipalities of the mother province. The movement to create a new province by dividing Davao del Norte started in the 1980s during the time of Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento, Sr., himself the author of RA No. 6430. However, this was not realized until his death in the late 1980s. His son, Rogelio M. Sarmiento, who became his successor in Congress, pushed for the passage of the bill creating the province. Upon consultation with the governor of Davao del Norte, Prospero S. Amatong, the province‚Äôs other two legislators, 3rd District Congressman Rodolfo P. Del Rosario and 2nd District Congressman Baltazar A. Sator, and other provincial and municipal officials, it was decided that the addition of four municipalities, namely Maco, Mabini, Pantukan, and Laak to the proposed province would be the most ideal and equitable configuration as this would make both provinces on an almost equal footing in terms of area, population, and development opportunities. It was also decided that Nabunturan would be the capital town because of its more central location. The name originally proposed for the province was Davao del Norte, the former name, or so it was thought, of the mother province. However, the House of Representatives‚Äô Reference and Research Bureau which conducted the research and legal work on the creation of the province found out that the mother province continues to be officially referred to as Davao del Norte in most official documents including the 1987 Philippine Constitution despite the passage of RA No. 6430 on June 17, 1972 renaming it as Davao Province. Tedious technical and legal issues needed to be resolved before the name could be adopted. The proposal was thus shelved and the name finally agreed upon was Compostela Valley, referring to the great fertile plain in the heartland of the province. The origin of the province‚Äôs inhabitants came from the ethnic tribes of the Mansaka, Mandaya, Manobo, Mangguangan, Dibabawon, Aeta, Kamayo, Davawe√±o and Kalagan. Similar to the history of other Mindanao provinces, most of the present populations of the province are descendants of migrants who came from Luzon and Visayas islands during the pre-war and post war eras. The bigger wave of immigrants came during the time of President Ramon Magsaysay wherein the policy of attraction adopted by the national government was to offer parcels of land to tenant-farmers. Although a virtual melting pot, the Visayans (mostly Cebuano-speaking) are the dominant group in Davao de Oro. New, as it is, Davao de Oro has achieved a distinction of sorts with the succession of three governors during the first four months of its existence. The first governor of the province was Prospero S. Amatong, the three-term governor (1986-1998) of the then undivided province of Davao del Norte, who held the position only for a day. As provided for in the law creating the new province, \\"incumbent elected officials (of Davao del Norte) are given option to serve the remainder of their term in Compostela Valley,\\" Amatong took this option and assumed the governorship of the then-Compostela Valley on March 26, 1998. The following day, he resigned and filed his candidacy for the congressional seat of the 2nd district of the new province. The governorship was turned over to Luz M. Sarmiento, by virtue of a presidential appointment. Luz M. Sarmiento, wife of then Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento, Sr. served the province from March 27, 1998 to June 30, 1998. She was succeeded by Jose R. Caballero. Jose R. Caballero, a practicing lawyer and former vice governor of then undivided Davao Del Norte (1988-1992) was the first elected governor of Compostela Valley. Arturo T. \\"Chiongkee\\" Uy is the fourth governor of Compostela Valley. He first served the province as member of the 3rd Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Compostela Valley (2004-2007) before he was elected as governor in the May 2007 national and local elections. Among his first acts as governor is the forging of a genuine unity among political leaders and among all sectors in the province in order to have synergy in crafting the province‚Äôs development and the delivery of public services. He is now serving the province in his second term of office as governor as he ran for the post unopposed during the May 2010 national and local elections. In 1955, the barrio (barangay) of New Sabonga was transferred to the municipality of Compostela from the municipality of Asuncion. On June 23, 1957, then President Carlos P. Garcia signed Republic Act No. 2038 which separated Compostela from Nabunturan. The first Mayor appointed by President Carlos P. Garcia was then Mayor Pio P. Galenzoga, one of the pioneer settlers. In the same year the sitios of Kao, Magkagong, Margosan, Matilo, Magangit, Cabacungan, Tigbatinao and Camanlangan were constituted into a barrio known as Santo Ni√±o. At the time, Compostela was an incongruous mixture of wooden- roofed houses concentrated along the Agusan River which was properly known as \\"dungguanan\\" (embarkation). This area later became its center of trade and commerce or Poblacion. =Change of name= A Senate bill officially renaming Compostela Valley to Davao de Oro was passed in 2019. Provincial officials led by Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy sees this as an opportunity to clear up confusion with its geographic location, with the province's name sometimes associated with Cagayan Valley and the town of Compostela in Cebu, and associate it further with fellow provinces in the Davao Region. They see this also as an opportunity to market the province better for further investments. The plebiscite was held on December 7, 2019 with majority of participants voting in favor of the name change. Geography Davao de Oro covers a total area of occupying the northeastern section of the Davao Region. The province borders Davao del Norte to the west, Agusan del Sur to the north, and Davao Oriental to the east. To the southwest lies the Davao Gulf. =Administrative divisions= Davao de Oro is divided into 2 districts comprising 11 municipalities. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table- layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border- collapse:collapse;\\" - !

The majority of the inhabitants are migrants from Cebu, Samar, Bohol and other Visayan provinces. The cultural minorities in the province include the Kalagan, Mansaka, Mandaya, Dibabawon, Mangguangan and Manobo groups such as the Atta, Talaingod, Langilan, and Matigsalug Manobo. Arnold Bajo is the most successful defender of the poor minorities, especially the Mandayas. He died in a battle while defending the poor. According to legends, 40 days after his death, his bodily spirit was infused into the statue of Ara-araba, the local tribe's god of harvest. From then on, he was worshipped as a god by the members of the Mandaya tribe. =Language= The primary language spoken in the province is Cebuano. Secondary languages include Kalagan, Mansaka, Mandaya, Ata Manobo, Dibabawnon, Tagalog, and English. =Religion= Roman Catholic is the predominate religion of this province forming 74% of the province population. Other significant religious minorities include Protestants which form 15% of the province population and Iglesia Ni Cristo which form 2% of the province population. Other religions are divided between Islam Sunni and Animist Economy Davao de Oro was billed as the second richest province in the Philippines by the Commission on Audit by year 2017. That year, its provincial government posted a record high of ‚Ç±18.75 billion worth of assets, the largest in whole Mindanao. The economic drive which brought the province to this status was caused by numerous business establishments, banana plantations, and vast gold and silver mines across the province, further augmented with its up-to-date transportation infrastructure. The province possesses one of the largest gold deposits in the Philippines, with 10 out of its 11 towns having one or more gold mines, the largest of which is at Mt. Diwalwal in the town of Monkayo. The town of Nabunturan, the provincial capital, is also home to the biggest gold ring in the Philippines, \\"The Solidarity Ring.\\" The main sources of livelihood in the province are agricultural products such as rice, coconut, cacao, coffee, papaya, mango, pineapple, durian and banana. Some residents in the province have fishponds and culture their own fish like tilapia and milkfish. Government Davao de Oro is headed by its governor as the chief executive. The vice governor is the presiding officer of the Davao de Oro Provincial Board, the province's legislature. Each municipality elects its own mayor, and a vice mayor presiding its Sangguniang Bayan. The province is represented by two representatives in the House of Representatives of the Philippines, each coming from a congressional district. The Senate is elected via national vote. The province's Regional Trial Court meets in Nabunturan. It has one branch under the Eleventh Judicial Region. * Governor: Jayvee Uy (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) * Vice governor: Carmen Zamora (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) * Board members: ** First district: *** Nena Atamos (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Adolfo Ang (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Marie Lopoz (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Renato Basa√±es (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Joseph Jauod (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) ** Second district: *** Arturo Uy (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Kristine Caballero- Ra√±on (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Raul Caballero (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Vivencia Secuya (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Macario Humol (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) ** Ex officio members: *** Randi Opisan *** Nicky Opisan (Hugpong ng Pagbabago) *** Charlemagne Bautista ** Sectoral member: *** Felipe Masambo References External links  The Official Website of the Provincial Government of Davao de Oro, Philippines * It's More Fun in the Philippines - Compostela Valley Provinces of the Philippines Valleys of the Philippines Davao Region States and territories established in 1998 1998 establishments in the Philippines ","title":"Davao de Oro"},{"id":"296994","text":"Bottlenose dolphins, the genus Tursiops, are the most common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Molecular studies show the genus contains three species: the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), and the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions. Their name derives from the Latin tursio (dolphin) and truncatus for their characteristic truncated teeth. Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging; using marine sponges to forage for food sources they normally could not access) and transmit cultural knowledge from generation to generation, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps. Bottlenose dolphins have the third largest encephalization levels of any mammal on Earth (humans have the largest), sharing close ratios with those of humans and other great apes, which more than likely contributes to their high intelligence and emotional intelligence. Taxonomy Scientists were long aware that the Tursiops dolphins might consist of more than one species, as there is extensive variation in color and morphology along its range. In the past, most studies used morphology to evaluate differences between and within species, but in the late 20th century, combining morphological and molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, most researchers acknowledged the existence of two species: the common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus), found in coastal and oceanic habitats of most tropical to temperate oceans, and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus), that lives in coastal waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa. In 2011, a third distinct species was described, the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, both in morphology and genetics. Also, evidence has been accumulating to validate the existence of a separate species, Lahille's bottlenose dolphin, T. gephyreus, that occurs in coastal waters of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The Society for Marine Mammalogy's Committee on Taxonomy, presently recognizes only two species, T. truncatus and T. aduncus, and two subspecies: the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (T. t. ponticus), that lives in the Black Sea, and Lahille's bottlenose dolphin (T. t. gephyreus). Other sources also accept the Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. t. gillii or T. gillii), that inhabits the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead. The IUCN, on their Red List of endangered species, also recognises only two species of bottlenose dolphins. alt=Profile photo of dolphin breaching Much of the discussion and doubts about its taxonomy is related to the existence of two ecotypes of bottlenose dolphins in many part of its distribution. The two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, but they have been shown to be genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible. Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin belongs in the genus Stenella, since it is more like the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common bottlenose dolphin. alt=Photo of left side of dolphin head at surface The fossil species Tursiops osennae =Hybrids= Bottlenose dolphins have been known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale- bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid. =Fossil species= Bottlenose dolphins appeared during the Miocene. Known fossil species include Tursiops osennae (late Miocene to early Pliocene) from the Piacenzian coastal mudstone, and Tursiops miocaenus (Miocene) from the Burdigalian marine sandstone, all in Italy. Description The bottlenose dolphin weighs an average of 300 kg (660 pounds). It can reach a length of just over 4 meters (13 feet). Its color varies considerably, is usually dark gray on the back and lighter gray on the flanks, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin. This is called countershading and is a form of camouflage. Older dolphins sometimes have a few spots. Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. Females typically live 5‚Äì10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose dolphins can jump at a height of 6 metres (20 feet) up in the air. Anatomy Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open. alt=Photo of dolphin above surface Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw. The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or \\"hind legs\\", at the tail, about the size of a human's pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism. Physiology and senses paddler at Dalkey Island In colder waters, they have more body fat and blood, and are more suited to deeper diving. Typically, 18%‚Äì20% of their bodyweight is blubber. Most research in this area has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Bottlenose dolphins typically swim at , but are capable of bursts of up to . The higher speeds can only be sustained for a short time.Goforth, Harold W. Jr. (1990) \\"Ergometry (Exercise Testing) of the Bottlenose Dolphin.\\" In The Bottlenose Dolphin, edited by Stephen Leatherwood and Randall R. Reeves, pp. 559‚Äì574. San Diego: Academic Press, Inc., . =Senses= The dolphin's search for food is aided by a form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by producing sounds and listening for the echoes. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \\"echoic image\\" or sound picture of their targets. Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The eyes are located at the sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or reflecting membrane, at the back of the retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe- shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera). By contrast, a bottlenose's sense of smell is poor, because its blowhole, the analog to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but this has not been well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference. =Communication= Bottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds, whistles, and body language. Examples of body language include leaping out of the water, snapping jaws, slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads. Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle). Researchers from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI), based in Sardinia (Italy) have now shown whistles and burst pulsed sounds are vital to the animals' social life and mirror their behaviors. The tonal whistle sounds (the most melodious ones) allow dolphins to stay in contact with each other (above all, mothers and offspring), and to coordinate hunting strategies. The burst-pulsed sounds (which are more complex and varied than the whistles) are used \\"to avoid physical aggression in situations of high excitement\\", such as when they are competing for the same piece of food, for example. The dolphins emit these strident sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. The \\"least dominant\\" one soon moves away to avoid confrontation. Other communication uses about 30 distinguishable sounds, and although famously proposed by John Lilly in the 1950s, no \\"dolphin language\\" has been found. However, Herman, Richards, and Wolz demonstrated comprehension of an artificial language by two bottlenose dolphins (named Akeakamai and Phoenix) in the period of skepticism toward animal language following Herbert Terrace's critique. Intelligence Bottlenose dolphin responding to human hand gestures. =Cognition= Cognitive abilities that have been investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: acoustic and behavioral mimicry, comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, memory, monitoring of self behavior, discrimination and matching, comprehension of symbols for various body parts, comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), mirror self-recognition, and numerical values. =Tool use and culture= At least some wild bottlenose dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably to protect it when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members). Mud plume feeding is a feeding technique performed by a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud in the water column and then rushing through the plume to capture fish. Along the beaches and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, bottlenose dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as \\"strand feeding\\". Groups of between two and six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water. The dolphins follow the fish, stranding themselves briefly, to eat their prey before twisting their bodies back and forth in order to slide back into the water. While initially documented in South Carolina and Georgia, strand feeding has also been observed in Louisiana, Texas, Baja California, Ecuador, and Australia. Some Mauritanian dolphins cooperate with human fishermen. The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.The Daily Telegraph (2006), \\"Brazil's sexiest secret\\", article retrieved January 24, 2016.Dr. Moti Nissani (2007) Bottlenose Dolphins in Laguna Requesting a Throw Net (video).

Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three bottlenose dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they elevate the upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her. A study conducted by the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they'd lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans. The bottlenose dolphins of John's Pass in Boca Ciega Bay, St. Petersburg FL, exhibit a rare form of self-decoration and social object use called grass-wearing. Self-decoration by wearing grass appears to be an attention-getting device rather than purely play and varies from a single blade to large clusters of grass. John's Pass dolphins self-decorate with grass primarily when they form new social groups or engage in procreative activities. Grass-wearing behavior among these dolphins is a local behavioral tradition that could constitute a cultural difference from other communities.Weaver, A., & Kuczaj, S. (2016). Neither toy nor tool: Grass- wearing behavior among free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in western Florida. International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 29, 1-18, uclapsych_ijcp_31885. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/893417x3 =Cortical neurons= Some researchers theorize mammalian intelligence correlates to the number of nerve cells (neurons) in the cortex of the brain. The neocortical neuron number of the bottlenose dolphin is unknown. However, the species with the highest number of neocortical neurons known to date is the long-finned pilot whale. Life history =Respiration and sleep= The bottlenose dolphin has a single blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The bottlenose dolphin typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole two to three times per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes. Dolphins can breathe while \\"half-asleep\\". During the sleeping cycle, one brain hemisphere remains active, while the other hemisphere shuts down. The active hemisphere handles surfacing and breathing behavior. The daily sleeping cycle lasts for about 8 hours, in increments of minutes to hours. During the sleeping cycle, they remain near the surface, swimming slowly or \\"logging\\", and occasionally closing one eye. =Reproduction= alt=Photo of juvenile diving just above its mother's dorsal fin Both sexes have genital slits on the underside of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit.Robeck, Todd R., et al. \\"Reproductive biology of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the potential application of advanced reproductive technologies.\\" Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine (1994): 321-336. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one on each side of the genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size. During the breeding season, males compete for access to females. Such competition can take the form of fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.Connor R. C. (1990) Alliances among male bottlenose dolphins and comparative analyses of mutualism. Ph.D. Dissertation. The University of Michigan, Michigan. Humans and dolphins are the only species that share this type of \\"gang formation\\" habit as a form of cooperation. Mating occurs belly to belly. Dolphins have been observed engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young, suggesting they may mate for pleasure. The gestation period averages 12 months. Births can occur at any time of year, although peaks occur in warmer months. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a (possibly male) \\"midwife\\", and usually only a single calf is born. Twins are possible, but rare. Newborn bottlenose dolphins are long and weigh , with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants. To accelerate nursing, the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands. The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years, and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning. Females sexually mature at ages 5‚Äì13, males at ages 9‚Äì14. Females reproduce every two to six years. Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable, and that early bonds aid protection, as well as in locating females. Female bottlenose dolphins have to expend additional energy in carrying out parental care, e.g. infant carrying behavior. Dolphins don't physically hold their infants but line up in an echelon position with infants swimming beside them. This position creates a change of water flow pattern from the infant which minimizes separation between the mother and infant, but also increases the mother's surface area and creates a drag for the swimmer. This also leaves less energy to use in swimming speed, foraging, and predator evasion. =Social interaction= An adult female bottlenose dolphin with her young, alt=Photo of one large and two small dolphins breaching together Adult males live mostly alone or in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young dolphins normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adult females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes, and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs.Wells, R.S., M.D. Scott and A.B. Irvine. (1987) \\"The social structure of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins\\", pp. 247‚Äì305 in: Genoways, H. (ed.), Current Mammalogy, Vol. 1. New York: Plenum Press. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000. The social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins \\"provide interesting parallels\\" with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees. Bottlenose dolphins studied by Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers off the island of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior does not depend on feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area. Ecology =Feeding= Fish is one of the main items in the dolphin diet. They also eat shrimps, squid, mollusks, and cuttlefish, and only swallow the soft parts. They eat 22 pounds of fish a day. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they work as a team to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called \\"fish whacking\\". \\"Strand feeding\\" is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud- flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore. This happens only during low tides. One type of feeding behavior seen in bottlenose dolphins is mud ring feeding. Bottlenose dolphins conflict with small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common bottlenose dolphins are probably attracted to fishing nets because they offer a concentrated food source. =Relations with other species= A bottlenose dolphin attacks and kills a alt=Photo of two animals at surface surrounded by spray Dolphins can exhibit altruistic behaviour toward other sea creatures. On Mahia Beach, New Zealand, on March 10, 2008, two pygmy sperm whales, a female and calf, stranded on the beach. Rescuers attempted to refloat them four times. Shortly, a playful bottlenose dolphin known to local residents as Moko arrived and, after apparently vocalizing at the whales, led them along a sandbar to the open sea, saving them from imminent euthanasia. In 2019 a female was observed caring for a juvenile melon-headed whale, the first reported instance of a bottlenose dolphin adopting a non-conspecific infant. The bottlenose dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank and access to females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, with a series of acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July 2014, four attacks with three porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay, Wales.Dolphin attacks on porpoises baffle experts BBC News, July 15, 2014 The bottlenose dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, such as the short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough- toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, they can also be hostile. =Predators= Some large shark species, such as the tiger shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the bottlenose dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee. Relation to humans =Interaction= alt=Profile photo of dolphin soaring over the outstretched arms of an aquarium entertainer The species sometimes shows curiosity towards humans in or near water. Occasionally, they rescue injured divers by raising them to the surface. They also do this to help injured members of their own species. In November 2004, a dramatic report of dolphin intervention came from New Zealand. Four lifeguards, swimming off the coast near Whangarei, were approached by a shark (reportedly a great white shark). Bottlenose dolphins herded the swimmers together and surrounded them for 40 minutes, preventing the shark from attacking, as they slowly swam to shore. In coastal regions, dolphins run the risk of colliding with boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety. However, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans. These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them. The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen. One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here, and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here). In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa. Commercial 'dolphin encounter' enterprises and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured and sold to some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation.Waples and Gales 2002. Evaluating and minimising social stress in the care of captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.10004/abstract However, others, notably SeaWorld, counter by claiming that the dolphins are properly cared for, have much environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans. Eight bottlenose dolphins that lived at the Marine Life Aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi were swept away from their aquarium pool during Hurricane Katrina. They were later found in the Gulf of Mexico and returned to captivity. K-Dog, trained by the alt=Photo of dolphin leaping clear of the water next to a man wearing a hat The military of the United States and Russia train bottlenose dolphins as military dolphins for wartime tasks, such as locating sea mines and detecting enemy divers. The U.S.'s program is the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, located in San Diego. Ti√£o was a well-known solitary male Bottlenose Dolphin that was first spotted in the town of S√£o Sebasti√£o in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with him. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned him the nickname \\"Killer Dolphin\\". =Cultural influence= The popular television show Flipper, created by Ivan Tors, portrayed a bottlenose dolphin in a friendly relationship with two boys, Sandy and Bud. A seagoing Lassie, Flipper understood English and was a hero: \\"Go tell Dad we're in trouble, Flipper! Hurry!\\" The show's theme song contains the lyric \\"no one you see / is smarter than he\\". The television show was based on a 1963 film, with a sequel, Flipper's New Adventure (1964), and was remade as a feature film in 1996, starring Elijah Wood and Paul Hogan, as well as a second TV series running from 1995 to 2000, starring Jessica Alba. Other television appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Wonder Woman, Highway to Heaven, Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, in which a dolphin, Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in Secrets of the Bermuda Triangle (1996 Ian Toynton movie), a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as seen on a Halloween episode of The Simpsons, Treehouse of Horror XI. Dolphin Tale, directed by Charles Martin Smith, starring Nathan Gamble, Ashley Judd, Harry Connick Jr., Morgan Freeman, Cozi Zuehlsdorff and Kris Kristofferson, is based on the real-life story of the dolphin Winter, who was rescued from a crab trap in December 2005 and lost her tail, but has learned to swim with a prosthetic one. Dolphin Tale 2, a sequel to the 2011 film, featured another dolphin named Hope and an appearance by Bethany Hamilton. The sequel was released on September 12, 2014. Bottlenose dolphins have appeared in novels. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and one of its sequels, So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish, the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth's impending destruction, but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful acrobatics. Bottlenose dolphins are central to David Brin's series of Uplift Universe novels, particularly Startide Rising, where they are one of the four Earth species (along with chimpanzees, gorillas, and dogs) to have been 'uplifted' to sentience. Bottlenose dolphins are primary characters in Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, especially The Dolphins of Pern. Bottlenose dolphins have been mentioned in various Star Trek novels and other materials as serving as navigation specialists onboard various Federation starships. Bottlenose dolphins have featured in video games, including in the title role of the science fiction video game series Ecco the Dolphin. Delphineus, a bottlenose dolphin, appears in the PC adventure game EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus. Delphineus helps the player character (a human boy called Adam) find the \\"sea king\\" Cetus (a sperm whale). Delphineus also helps Adam clean up the marine environment where he lives. T.D., the Miami Dolphins' mascot, uses the bottlenose dolphin as its mascot and team logo. Factual descriptions of the dolphins date back into antiquity ‚Äì the writings of Aristotle, Oppian and Pliny the Elder all mention the species. =Threats= Millions of dolphins drown in fishing nets. Tuna fishing crews have been the most responsible for the largest number of deaths. In 1972, the U.S government passed a law limiting the number of dolphins that could be killed yearly by tuna fishing crews. Dolphins in the United Kingdom have also been found to contain high levels of pollutants in their tissues. Heavy metals including mercury, PCB's and DDT are of great concern. These pollutants can cause harm in dolphins growth development, reproduction, and immunity. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of dolphins have been trained to perform in shows presented by aquariums, zoos, and amusement parks. Scientists conduct various types of research to understand the dolphin's communication system. The man- made chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising the immune system of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS has been reported in bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues in many areas of the globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins. =Conservation= Bottlenose dolphin (at Hundred Islands National Park). Bottlenose dolphins are not endangered. Their future is stable because of their abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident to an increase in warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik et al. 2016). In US waters, hunting and harassing of marine mammals is forbidden in almost all circumstances, from the passing of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

Family business  Rank was born on 22 or 23 December 1888 at Kingston upon Hull in England into a Victorian family environment, which was dominated by his father Joseph Rank who had built a substantial flour milling business. He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Joseph is reported to have told his son Arthur that he was \\"a dunce at school\\" and that the only way that he could succeed in life would be in his father's flour mill. J. Arthur ventured on his own with Peterkins Self-Raising Flour, but when that business failed he returned to work for his father. That was the business (Joseph Rank Limited) that he later inherited and which became known as Rank Hovis McDougall (now owned by British food conglomerate Premier Foods).  Religious challenge  Rank was a devout member of the Methodist Church and in his middle age he taught at Sunday School to which he began to show religious films. This practice expanded to other churches and schools and it led to his formation of the Religious Film Society to which he then distributed films that he had also made. His first production was called Mastership. When the Methodist Times newspaper began to complain about the negative influence that British and American films shown in Britain were having on family life, their editorial was answered by the London Evening News who suggested that instead of complaining, the Methodist Church should provide a solution. Rank took up the challenge and via an introduction by a young film producer named John Corfield, he discussed both the problem and a solution with Lady Yule of Bricket Wood. The net result of these meetings was the formation of the British National Films Company. The first commercial production by this company was Turn of the Tide (1935), a movie based upon a recently published 1932 novel by Leo Walmsley called Three Fevers. Having created their movie, British National then had to get it distributed and exhibited, but this proved to be more difficult than making the movie itself. Some commercial screens began showing Turn of the Tide as a second feature, but this was not enough exposure for the company to make a profit.  Pinewood Film Studios  Having first created a film production company and having made a movie at another studio, Rank, Lady Yule and John Corfield began talking to Charles Boot who had recently bought the estate of Heatherden Hall at Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, for the purpose of turning it into a movie studio that would rival those in Hollywood, California. In 1935 the trio became owner-operators of Pinewood Film Studios. Lady Yule later sold her shares to Rank while John Corfield resigned from its board of directors.  Commercial challenge  The problems encountered in the distribution of Turn of the Tide were addressed when Rank discovered that the people who controlled the British film industry had ties to the American movie industry and that for all practical purposes he was shut out of his own domestic market. American films occupied 80% of British screen time during the era before World War II. In 1935 Rank arrived at a solution to his distribution problems. Because the middlemen controlled the distribution pipeline from production to exhibition, he decided to buy a large part of both the distribution and exhibition systems. He began by forming a partnership with film maker C. M. Woolf to form General Film Distributors, which in 1936 was incorporated in Rank's General Cinema Finance Corporation but continued to handle all distribution for the Rank organisation until 1955, when it was renamed J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors.BFI: General Film Distributors Retrieved 2 September 2011  Rank Organisation  In 1939 Rank consolidated his film production interests in both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios. In 1938 Rank bought the Odeon Cinemas chain. and the Amalgamated Studios in Borehamwood, although the latter were never used as film studios by Rank. In 1941, it absorbed Gaumont-British, which owned 251 cinemas, and the Lime Grove Studios, (later bought by BBC Television) and acquired the Paramount Cinemas chain, so that by 1942 the Rank Organisation owned 619 cinemas. Other interests were acquired (such as the Bush Radio company in 1949) which would be added to the interests in a few more years) within a new company called the Rank Organisation. Rank retired as Chairman in 1962 and was succeeded by John Davis, who had been Managing Director since 1948.  Films  During the 1940s, the companies Rank controlled produced some of the finest British films of the period, including: The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), Henry V (1944), A Matter of Life and Death (1946), Black Narcissus (1947), and The Red Shoes (1948). From the 1950s, fewer adventurous film projects were attempted and Rank concentrated on producing solidly commercial ventures, mainly aimed at the family market. These include the popular Norman Wisdom comedies and the Doctor... films. However some more serious films were produced during this era including: Carve Her Name With Pride (1958), and Victim (1961), as well as a clutch of prestige topics such as the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and filmed performances by The Royal Ballet.  Core interests and legacy Although his critics claimed that many of the films that he had produced under the name of Rank were not exactly in keeping with his original intention of producing \\"family- friendly\\" films (which John Davis had said was company policy)Brian McFarlane \\"Davis, John (1906-1993)\\", BFI screenonline; McFarlane (ed.) Encyclopedia of British Film, London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.164 to challenge American competition, he nevertheless kept to his core beliefs. To that end in 1953 he set up the J. Arthur Rank Group Charity to promote Christian belief. The charity later became known as The Rank Foundation. He was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949. In 1957 J. Arthur Rank was raised to the peerage as Baron Rank, of Sutton Scotney in the County of Southampton (Sutton Scotney is a small village between Andover and Winchester in Hampshire). =Rank Foundation and prizes= Rank and his wife were philanthropists who performed a lot of charitable work, and in 1953 they founded the J. Arthur Rank Group Charity, now The Rank Foundation. The Foundation continues to support activities which encourage, develop and support young people, and other disadvantaged groups. It also supports activities promoting Christian principles through media such as film. PDF there are three chairpersons of the orgnaisation: Rank‚Äôs son-in-law, Robin Cowen, and his grandsons Fred Packard and Joey Newton. Donations were made from The Rank Foundation to endow The Rank Prize Funds, established shortly before Rank's death, on 16 February 1972. The two Funds, the Human and Animal Nutrition and Crop Husbandry Fund and the Optoelectronics Fund, support sciences reflecting Rank's business interests through his \\"connection with the flour-milling and cinema and electronics industries\\", and also because Rank believed that they would be of great benefit to humanity. There are two Rank Prizes, and the Funds also recognise, support and foster excellence among young people in the two fields of nutrition and optoelectronics. The Rank Prize for Optoelectronics supports, encourages, and rewards researchers working at the cutting edge of optoelectronics research, initially (from 1976) awarded annually, now a biennial prize worth ¬£30,000. The Rank Prize for Nutrition was awarded at various intervals since 1976, but now also awarded biennially, and worth ¬£40,000. =Rank Fellowship= Inspired by his personal knowledge of the Brazilian Funda√ß√£o Estudar, the Rank Fellowship was created in 2003 by Rank's eldest grandson, Fred Arthur Rank Packard, who became Chairman of the Rank Foundation in 2000. Fred was one of the founders of the Brazilian investment banking firm Banco Garantia, along with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicuperia. Family Rank married Nell, and they had two daughters, Shelagh (who was married first to Fred Packard who lived in Hollywood, and then to Robin Cowen) and Ursula (born 1920). When he died in March 1972, aged 83, his barony became extinct. In popular culture J. Arthur Rank's name was parodied on the PBS children's educational TV show The Electric Company as J. Arthur Crank (voiced and later performed by Jim Boyd), a character wearing a plaid shirt, suspenders and a porkpie hat, who was in a perpetually cranky mood (hence his name)Electric Company Crank, YouTube whenever he interrupted sketches to complain when spellings or pronunciations confused him or when he was mistaken for someone else.Electric Company - Morgan Freeman DJ, YouTube \\"J. Arthur Rank\\" has also been used as cockney rhyming slang, both for \\"bank\\" and \\"wank\\" (slang for masturbation), typically shortened to \\"J. Arthur\\" or just \\"Arthur\\".

The discipline has historically prefigured, and remains integrally linked to, macroeconomics. This branch also examines the effects of monetary systems, including regulation of money and associated financial institutions and international aspects. Modern analysis has attempted to provide microfoundations for the demand for money and to distinguish valid nominal and real monetary relationships for micro or macro uses, including their influence on the aggregate demand for output.‚Ä¢ Robert Clower, 1967. \\"A Reconsideration of the Microfoundations of Monetary Theory,\\" Western Economic Journal, 6(1), pp. 1-8. ‚Ä¢ _, 1987.

Abstract. *Game theory as a modeling paradigm for monetary and financial institutions * Possible advantages of following a monetary-policy rule to avoid inefficiencies of time inconsistency from discretionary policy History =Islamic Golden Age= At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th‚Äì12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, promissory notes, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits. =1500s to 1700s= Silver coin of the Maurya Empire, known as r≈´pyar≈´pa, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BC. The French East India Company issued rupees in the name of Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748) for Northern India trade. This was cast in Pondicherry. In the Indian subcontinent, Sher Shah Suri (1540‚Äì1545), introduced a silver coin called a rupiya, weighing 178 grams. Its used was continued by the Mughal rulers. The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC. Ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Lydian staters, several other Middle Eastern coinages and the Chinese wen. The term is from r≈´pya, a Sanskrit term for silver coin, from Sanskrit r≈´pa, beautiful form. The imperial taka was officially introduced by the monetary reforms of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1329. It was modeled as representative money, a concept pioneered as paper money by the Mongols in China and Persia. The tanka was minted in copper and brass. Its value was exchanged with gold and silver reserves in the imperial treasury. The currency was introduced due to the shortage of metals. Both the Kabuli rupee and the Kandahari rupee were used as currency in Afghanistan prior to 1891, when they were standardized as the Afghan rupee. The Afghan rupee, which was subdivided into 60 paisas, was replaced by the Afghan afghani in 1925. Until the middle of the 20th century, Tibet's official currency was also known as the Tibetan rupee. Serious interest in the concepts behind money occurred during the dramatic period of inflation in the late 15th to early 17th centuries known as the Price Revolution, during which the value of gold fell precipitously, sometimes fluctuating wildly, because of the importation of gold from the New World, primarily by Spain. At the end of this period, the first modern texts on monetary economics were beginning to appear. During the eighteenth century, the concept of banknotes became more common in Europe. David Hume referred to it as \\"this new invention of paper\\".History of Monetary and Credit Theory In 1705, John Law in Scotland published Money and Trade Considered, which examined the failure of metal-based money during the previous hundred and fifty years. He proposed replacing that system with a land bank system of paper money based on the value of real estate. He succeeded in getting this proposal implemented. However, his bank failed due to a bubble of speculation collapsing into extreme inflation; perhaps because he failed to take the lessons of the Spanish Price Revolution seriously. In 1720, Isaac Gervaise wrote The System or Theory of the Trade of the World. He criticised mercantilism and state-supported credit for the inflation problems of his era. Della Moneta, was published by Ferdinando Galiani in 1751, and is arguably the first modern text on economic theory. It was printed twenty-five years before Adam Smith's more famous book, The Wealth of Nations, which touched on some of the same topics. Della Moneta covered many modern monetary concepts, including the value, origin, and regulation of money. It carefully examined the possible causes for money's value to fluctuate. The year following, 1752, Of the Balance of Trade was published by Hume. He argued that one need not worry about the import or export of goods creating a surplus or shortage of either money or goods because an excess or shortage of money will always increase or decrease demand until equilibrium is reached. In modern economic terms, this is as equilibration through the price-specie flow mechanism.

Soon after, Nitta Yoshisada joined their cause, and laid siege to Kamakura. When the city fell to Nitta, the Shogunal regent, H≈çj≈ç Takatoki, and his clansmen committed suicide. This ended the Kamakura shogunate, as well as the H≈çj≈ç clan's power and influence. Go-Daigo was enthroned once more as emperor, reestablishing the primacy of the Imperial court in Kyoto and starting the so-called Kenmu Restoration. However, shortly thereafter, the samurai clans became increasingly disillusioned with the reestablished imperial court, which sought to return to the social and political systems of the Heian period. Sensing their discontent, Takauji pleaded with the emperor to do something before rebellion would break out, however his warnings were ignored. H≈çj≈ç Tokiyuki, son of Takatoki, took the opportunity to start the Nakasendai rebellion to try to reestablish the shogunate in Kamakura in 1335. Takauji put down the rebellion and took Kamakura for himself. Taking up the cause of his fellow samurai, he claimed the title of Sei-i Taish≈çgun and allotted land to his followers without permission from the court. Takauji announced his allegiance to the imperial court, but Emperor Go-Daigo sent Nitta Yoshisada to reclaim Kamakura. Tomb of Ashikaga Takauji at T≈çji-in in KyotoTakauji defeated Yoshisada in the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima. This cleared the path for Takauji and Tadayoshi to march on to Kyoto. He captured Kyoto for a few days in Feb. 1336, only to be driven out and to Ky≈´sh≈´ by the arrival of forces under Prince Takanaga, Prince Norinaga, Kitabatake Akiie and Y≈´ki Munehiro. Takauji and his brother were forced to retreat to the west. Takauji then allied himself with the clans native to Ky≈´sh≈´. After defeating the Kikuchi clan at Hakata Bay in the Battle of Tatarahama (1336), Takauji was \\"virtually master of Kyushu\\". His brother advanced simultaneously by land and both reached the environs of present-day Kobe in July. At the decisive Battle of Minatogawa in 1336, Takauji defeated Yoshisada again and killed Masashige, allowing him to seize Kyoto for good. Emperor K≈çmy≈ç of the illegitimate Northern Court (see below) was installed as emperor by Takauji in opposition to the exiled Southern Court, beginning the turbulent Northern and Southern Court period (Nanboku-ch≈ç), which saw two emperors fight each other and which would last for almost 60 more years. Besides other honors, Emperor Go-Daigo had given Takauji the title of Chinjufu-sh≈çgun, or Commander-in-chief of the Defense of the North, and the courtly title of the Fourth Rank, Junior Grade.Titsingh, Isaac.

Basilan Island is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago. It is just off the southern coast of the geographic Zamboanga Peninsula. Isabela, the former capital, is a component city under the provincial government of Basilan but is administered as part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region and is listed statistically independent. The provincial capital has since been transferred to Lamitan. Basilan is home to three main ethnolingusitic groups: the indigenous Yakans, and the later-arriving Tausugs and Chavacanos. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are mainly Christian. There are also a number of smaller ethnic groups. Although the official languages are Tagalog and English, the main native language is Yakan and lingua franca is Chavacano. Other languages include Tausug, Cebuano, and Sama. Basilan, although classified as a 3rd-class province in terms of gross provincial income, has one of the lowest incidences of poverty in the Philippines (26.19% of the general population), ranked 20 among the Philippines' 80 provinces. (In comparison, Maguindanao which is ranked last at number 80 has a poverty incidence of 44.24%.) The gap between Basilan's rich and poor residents are among the narrowest in the country (ranked 3rd nationwide), pointing to one of the most equitable distributions of wealth anywhere in the country (Gini coefficient 0.2826, which is slightly better than the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Cavite, Batanes and Batangas). Geography Basilan in Mindanao, Philippines (Regions IX, X, XII and ARMM) Basilan is located between latitudes 6¬∞15' and 7¬∞00' and longitudes 121¬∞15' and 122¬∞30'. The island is bordered by the Basilan Strait to the north, the Sulu Sea to the northwest and west, the Moro Gulf to the northeast, and the Celebes Sea to the south, southeast and east. Basilan is the largest and northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago between the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Borneo which includes about 400 islands. Basilan Strait, about at its narrowest point, separates Basilan Island from the mainland of Mindanao and the port city of Zamboanga. The terrain of the island is simple, with several undulating slopes concentrated around Isabela City along the coastal areas and hilly towards the interior. Urban areas are usually above sea level and gently sloping to toward the hinterlands. The stand of timber and forest vegetation is more or less evenly distributed throughout. Topographical map of Basilan and outlying islands The province encompasses Basilan Island and all nearby offshore islands, together with the Pilas Island group (now Hadji Muhtamad Municipality) west of the island, and the Bubuan and Tapiantana Island group (now Tabuan-Lasa Municipality) in the south. These are listed among the Philippine islands with a moderate risk of getting hit by tsunamis. The province has a land area of under its jurisdiction. Basilan Island itself has an area of and a shoreline of . Basilan National Park is at the eastern portion of the remaining public forest between the city of Isabela and the municipalities of Lamitan, Tipo-Tipo and Sumisip. The park has an elevation of above sea level, and the tallest peak, Puno Mahaji or Basilan Peak, dominates the park's landscape. =Climate= The climate is similar to other areas in the Zamboanga Peninsula. The annual average rainfall is and the mean annual temperature is . The source of the rainfall is the southwest monsoon and the island's location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The climate is classified as a tropical wet and dry climate or Aw using the K√∂ppen climate classification system. Basilan is outside the typhoon belt. Prevailing winds are from the southwest with a speed of . March to May is hot and dry, with temperature averaging . June to October is rainy. November to February is cool, with temperatures ranging from to . Average humidity year-round is 77%. =Administrative divisions= Isabela, Lamitan, and Maluso Basilan is subdivided into 11 municipalities and two cities. Isabela, on the northern shore of Basilan Island facing Zamboanga City, is a component city and then capital of the province from 1975 to 2017. Isabela votes for provincial officials, shares its tax revenues with the province, and continues to be under the jurisdiction of Basilan for the administration of provincially devolved services and functions. However, for the administration of regional services, the city is part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region, while the rest of Basilan in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Basilan used to be part of Western Mindanao (the former name of Zamboanga Peninsula) but, in a recent plebiscite, the residents of some parts of Basilan opted to join ARMM, with the exception of Isabela. Originally called Pasangen (the rough English translation is \\"town\\") by natives, it still hosts the Basilan Provincial Capitol, the Governor's Executive Residence, the provincial offices of the executive departments and line agencies as well as most of the municipal offices of its neighboring municipalities. Starting in 1848 it was officially renamed Isabela de Basilan, derived from the Spanish fort built on the area where the present Provincial Capitol now stands ‚Äî Fort Isabella Segunda ‚Äî which, in turn, was named after Spanish Queen Isabella II. It was renamed Isabela Municipality in 1973 and formally as the City of Isabela on April 25, 2001. Lamitan became a city in July 2007, although it remains in the ARMM. It is on the northeastern coast of Basilan, where most of Basilan's plains are. Lamitan is experiencing a renewed economic vigor that continues to power the rest of the province's otherwise lackluster growth. A November 18, 2008 decision of the Supreme Court, however, effectively voided the law converting Lamitan to a city after the League of Cities of the Philippines filed a petition earlier in the year. With 16 other local government units, Lamitan's cityhood was again voided in a Supreme Court decision handed down on August 26, 2010, returning it to the status of municipality. On February 17, 2011, the supreme court upheld for the third time the cityhood of Lamitan and 15 other towns in the Philippines. Lamitan was proclaimed the new capital of Basilan since 2001, when Isabela opted out of the ARMM in a plebiscite held that year. Most provincial offices of the ARMM for Basilan are in Lamitan. Lamitan derives its name from Sultan Kudarat's capital town in the Mindanao mainland ‚Äî Ramitan. The Iranun Sultan built a fortified base in the area to serve as a staging ground for raids on Spanish Zamboanga. The native Yakans regarded this as \\"a place where people from Ramitan stayed\\" or Kuta Ramitan. Eventually, the wooden fortress was razed to the ground by Gov. Gen. Corcuera in 1637. Natives just called the place \\"Ramitan\\", and substituting 'R' with 'L', the place gradually became known as simply Lamitan. It became the province's capital since 2017. 270px The other five original municipalities are: *Maluso is on the island's southwest, facing the bigger island of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi further south. Its busiest trading port is at Port Holland and Maluso Townsite. According to official accounts, the place derived its name from Spanish \\"mal uso\\" (trans. \\"bad manners\\"), after the supposedly crude manners of the natives of the place when they established their presence there in the later part of the 19th century. *Lantawan is in the island's westernmost area. It is mostly an agricultural area for copra and rubber production. Its biggest population concentration is Tairan. It has no major port. \\"Lantawan\\" is derived from the native root word \\"lantaw\\" (trans. \\"look\\"), named after Basilan's westernmost peninsula's sloping hills which served as \\"lookouts\\" for natives who observed Tausug and Spanish and ships pass by en route to another raid or naval attack on Jolo or Zamboanga. *Sumisip is the biggest municipality in land area and hosts what used to be the biggest rubber plantation (Sime Darby) in the Philippines. *Tuburan is on a peninsula on the extreme eastern part of the island, one of the least developed municipalities and severely devastated by the decades-old armed conflicts plaguing the island. \\"Tuburan\\" is rooted in the native word \\"tubod\\" (trans. \\"water spring\\"), as there is said to be a spring in the area. *Tipo-Tipo, the last of the original municipalities created by the presidential decree of Ferdinand Marcos, is on the island's southeast coast. It is mostly undeveloped and witness to much of the running gun battles on the island. The place is named after the native word \\"Tipun- tipunan\\" (trans. \\"gathering place\\"), owing to its tendency for natives of the area to converge in this spot to exchange goods and food stuff with each other. The latest six municipalities are creations of the regional legislature of the ARMM: *Akbar (MMA Act No. 193), separated from Tuburan municipality in 2005, named after a political strongman, the late Congressman Wahab Akbar *Al- Barka (MMA Act No. 191, ratified in 2006) *Hadji Mohammad Ajul (MMA Act No. 192, ratified in 2006), from Tuburan, named after the first mayor of Tuburan *Hadji Muhtamad (MMA Act No. 200, ratified in 2007), named after the father of late Wahab Akbar and separated from Lantawan *Tabuan-Lasa (created by virtue of MMA Act No. 187, ratified in 2008) was separated from Sumisip and is named after the main islands of Tapiantana, Bubuan, Lanawan and Saluping. *Ungkaya Pukan (MMA Act No. 190, ratified in 2006), named after Orang Kaya Pukan, ancestor of the Akbar family and nemesis of Datu Kalun The new municipalities were created without the consent of the Philippine Congress. According to some accounts, said municipalities do not reach the basic requirements for the creation of a separate municipality ( area, P2.5 million income, and 25,000 population) under the Philippines' Local Government Code. (Recent Supreme Court rulings nullified the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan Province, created by the same ARMM Regional Assembly, reverting it to the 1st District of Maguindanao Province.) As a result, four of the six new municipalities have not been included in the government's annual budget as approved by Congress and have not received any nationally funded Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA) since their creation. These are Hadji Muhtamad, Mohammad Ajul, Al Barka and Akbar municipalities. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  City municipality ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=3  Population ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Density ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border- bottom:0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Coordinates - ! style=\\"border-top:0;\\" colspan=2  ! style=\\"border-width:0 0 thin thin;\\" colspan=2  ! style=\\"border- width:0 thin thin 0;\\"  ! style=\\"border-top:0;\\"  ! style=\\"border-width:0 0 thin thin;\\"  km2 ! style=\\"border-width:0 thin thin 0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! style=\\"border-width:0 0 thin thin;\\"  /km2 ! style=\\"border-width:0 thin thin 0;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! style=\\"border-top:0;\\"  ! style=\\"border-top:0;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Akbar   13,369     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  9  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Al-Barka   19,523     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  16  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  '''' - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Hadji Mohammad Ajul   15,962     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  11  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background- color:initial;\\"  Hadji Muhtamad   12,249   ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background-color:initial;border-right:0;\\"  Isabela  style=\\"text-align:right;border-left:0;\\" ‚àó   97,857     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  45  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background-color:initial;border-width:medium 0 medium medium;\\"  Lamitan  style=\\"text-align:right;border-width:medium medium medium 0;\\" ‚Ä†   68,996   ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  45  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Lantawan   20,087   ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  25  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background- color:initial;\\"  Maluso   33,803     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  20  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background- color:initial;\\"  Sumisip   37,031   ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  29  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Tabuan-Lasa   18,635     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  12  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  '''' - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Tipo-Tipo   16,978     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  11  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Tuburan   18,988   ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=2 style=\\"background-color:initial;\\"  Ungkaya Pukan   17,701     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  12  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  '''' - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-variant:small- caps;letter-spacing:0.05em;\\"  Total ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  459,367 ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  391,179 ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  1,327.23 ! ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ! style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  ! 210 ! style=\\"font-style:italic;\\"  - class=\\"sortbottom\\" style=\\"background-color:#F2F2F2;border-top:double grey;line-height:1.3em;\\"  colspan=\\"13\\"  } History Old Plaza Rizal and Plaza Misericordia, opposite Santa Isabel Cathedral, old City Hall (Provincial Capitol) atop the hill in the background. Several waves of Negrito and ancient Chinese migration populated the Philippines. The Yakan people arrived in the area of the Sulu Archipelago, of which Basilan is a part, around 300 BCE to 200 BCE. Little is known of them before the era of Spanish colonization, but they still make up the largest ethnic group on the main island of Basilan. It is believed that the Yakan people of Basilan made contact with the Kingdom of Champa in present-day Vietnam, and many of them have ancestries from Champa settlers, who later integrated with the Yakan. As the Tausug Sultanate of Sulu grew in power, the Yakans withdrew inland, until most of the coastal communities along the island's southern, western and northwestern shores were primarily inhabited by Tausugs and their vassal tribes, the Samals and Bajaus (Tau-Laut). The only exception was the relatively prosperous Yakan communities of Lamitan. Basilan first came to European attention when it was documented by the remnants of the Ferdinand Magellan expedition in 1521. It was eventually colonized by the Spanish as early as 1636 and was formally ceded by the Sulu Sultanate to Spain in 1726. The withdrawal of the Yakans inland was hastened by Spanish establishment of advance bases on the island's northwestern coast, bringing in Christianized 'indios' from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon. By then, even the Yakan communities of Lamitan were completely overrun. Jesuit missionaries brought Catholicism to the region. Fighting with the Sultanate, the Dutch East India Company, Moro Pirates, and the French figured in Basilan's history over the years. With its victory in the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States gained possession of the Philippines. Americans proceeded to 'pacify' Basilan, cleared large expanses of land, and established plantations, mainly to produce rubber and copra. Following the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II, in 1946, the Philippines gained its independence. Beginning around 1970, heavy fighting broke out between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front, which was determined to secede and form a new country. In 1973, Basilan officially became a province. It joined the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2001, the last province to do so. Its former capital, Isabela City, opted out and remains a part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (formerly Western Mindanao, Region 9). Etymology Examples of finely crafted Moro blades made from Basilan \\"basih\\" (iron). Oral traditions of the local Yakan people include several names for pre-historic Basilan: \\"Uleyan\\", which is derived from the present-named Basilan Peak (Puno Mahaji), and later changed to \\"Matangal\\" after a mountain farther to the east of the island. These names were presumably used by the Maguindanao traders from mainland Mindanao, using these mountains as navigation landmarks when sailing the Celebes Sea. Other names romantically given were \\"Puh Gulangan\\" or \\"island of forests\\", \\"Umus Tambun\\" or \\"fertile land\\", \\"Kumalarang\\" after the westward flowing river on the island's western half which is otherwise called Baunuh Peggesan. =Taguima= Pre-Hispanic texts from the royal archives of the Sulu Sultanate referred to the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago as Taguima, from the Yakan who were called \\"Tagihamas\\" (people of the interior or hinterlands) by the Tausug and Samal peoples who came and settled in numerous scattered communities along Basilan's western and southwestern shores and outlying islets and island groups. Later references mentioned \\"Bantilan\\", probably referring to Maluso, which was established as a major Tausug base by Sulu Sultan Muizz ud-Din (whose princely name was Datu Bantilan). Imperial Chinese texts mention a \\"Kingdom of Kumalarang\\" (from the Yakan \\"kumalang\\" or \\"to sing\\", owing to the location being a place for celebrations and gatherings) during the Ming Dynasty, believed to be the island which now has a barangay of the same name on its northwestern shores. The first Spanish map of Mindanao officially naming \\"Basilan\\" island (instead of Taguima/Tagyma) by Nicolas Norton Nicols, published in 1757. The earliest map of the Philippines which made reference to an island labeled \\"Taguima\\" was produced by Giacomo Gastaldi, through woodblock prints in 1548. It was subsequently included in the influential travel book of Giovanni Battista Ramusio, the Della Navigatione e Viaggi, which was published between 1556 and 1583 in three volumes. This was followed by Abraham Ortelius's work Indiae Orientalis Insularumque Adiacientium Typus, published in 1573 in a German text edition of the atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Christophe Plantin in Antwerp. As late as 1719, a map titled \\"Die philippinische Inseln - Isle Brneo\\" by Allain Manesson Mallet of Frankfurt, Germany featured an island labeled \\"Tagyma I.\\" The process by which all these names became \\"Basilan\\" is almost certainly due to miscommunication between the natives and the Spanish, as well as the penchant to engage in editorial license by European map-makers of the era. Basilan's name may also derive from its iron ore deposits. Tausug warriors and slave- traders from Sulu came to Taguima to purchase high-quality magnetic iron ores, which they used for swords, knives and other blades. This profitable trade, helped in large measure by the establishment of Maluso as a major military- naval base of the Sulu Sultanate, eventually gave the island the distinction of being the source of basih-balan, the Tausug word for magnetic iron. Roughly translated and abbreviated, however, basih-lan means \\"the iron (magnet) trail\\" or \\"the iron way\\". When several Tausug warriors were caught by the Spanish in one of their numerous raids on the Zamboanga settlement, Spanish officials supposedly admired the artistry and skill that went into making the warriors' elaborately decorated swords, knives and blades. They asked where these weapons could be bought. From atop the ramparts of the Spanish commandery at the Fuerza del Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Fort Pilar), the warriors supposedly pointed to the island visible across today's Basilan Strait, and said, simply, \\"ha basih-lan\\". Reports from the Jesuit reducciones in Zamboanga and Pasangen (Isabela) were relayed to Manila, where Spanish cartographer Pedro Murillo de Velarde published Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compa√±ia de Jesvs. Segvnda parte using the Jesuit printing press at Manila in 1749. It featured a map of the Philippines with the unofficial \\"I. Basilan\\". The map was re-published by Leipzig map-maker Nicolaus Bellinn for general European circulation in 1752. Finally, to represent a clear break from the Habsburg Dynasty (which had ruled Spain for 184 years from 1516 to 1700), the first officially sanctioned Spanish maps of its colonies, including \\"Las Islas de Mindanao\\", were commissioned by the Bourbons (1700‚Äìpresent). This particular map of Mindanao, apparently copied from the Nicolaus Bellinn map of 1752, was published by Nicolas Norton Nicols in 1757, featuring \\"Basilan\\" and bearing the royal stamp of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VI. It has been called \\"Isla de Basilan\\" (Basilan Island) ever since. =Treasure Islands of the Southern Seas= Basilan Island's reputation as a staging-ground for Moro raids on Zamboanga, the Visayas and even Luzon, and as a temporary repository of the plunder from these raids, gave the island a notoriety not unlike the \\"Treasure Islands\\" of the West Indies or the buccaneers' havens and pirate coves of the Caribbean. Spanish and Tausug fleets engaged each other in sea battles and skirmishes not far from the western shores of the islands. Many of their ships were scuttled or sunk, sometimes with precious cargoes of traded goods and Mexican silver pieces meant for the fort in Zamboanga and the naval squadron at Isabela, as well as goods en route to Jolo from the Mindanao mainland. The Spanish Pigafetta expedition landed on a group of islets west of the main island of Basilan, where they found precious pearls; subsequent Spanish cartographers aptly named these the \\"Isletas de Perlas\\" (Pearl Islets). Native Samal and Bajao folk called this group of islets and reefs \\"Pilas\\" (Perlas), a name used to this day. More recently, there have been local rumors about gold bars and other trinkets hidden among the many islets by retreating Japanese troops at the end of World War II. To date, treasure hunters of many nationalities, among them Japanese and Europeans, have scoured the area. All these tales of treasures hidden in Basilan's many remote, unpopulated islets gave it the nickname \\"Treasure Islands of the Southern Seas\\", immortalized in the official anthem of the Province of Basilan, \\"Fair Basilan\\", composed by Basilan lyricist and composer Tranquilino Gregorio. People =Culture= Santa Isabel Cathedral, in the heart of Isabela City's poblacion, is the center of Basilan's thriving Catholic community. The biggest cultural influences on the island derive from Basilan's tri- ethnolingusitic community: the native Yakan, Tausug, and Chavacano peoples. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are primarily Catholic. Among the Tausugs and Samals, the phrase \\"mag-tausug na kaw\\" means \\"become a Muslim\\", instead of the more literal translation, \\"become a Tausug\\", as the Tausug ethnic is regarded as the \\"original Muslims\\" of the area. Although the majority of the Yakans are Muslims, a significant number conform to traditional local beliefs, traditions and rituals, while a few have likewise opted to be baptized Catholics. Along with a majority of the Chavacano, the Cebuano and the Ilonggo/Hiligaynon Bisaya are also Catholics. Yakan interior/east: Yakans gathered at Materling, Al Barka (Tipo-Tipo), Basilan, visited by Kapamilya broadcaster Bernadette Sembrano. Culturally, the Yakan and the Tausug are distinct ethnolinguistic nations; the Yakan represent the \\"Lumad\\" (albeit lately most Yakans have since converted to Islam) or indigenous peoples of Basilan, while the Tausugs, the Samal and the Bajao are regarded as the \\"original Muslims\\", and the Chavacano, Cebuano and Ilonggo are the \\"Cristianos\\". The rest, a mixture of Ilocanos, Waray, Bicolanos, Maranaos, Iranuns and Maguindanaos, are more recent migrants permanently residing in the region, itinerant merchants or government workers. This mix of ethnicities, forged first by the Spanish practice of establishing re-settlements or reducciones, as well as the multinational plantations' importation of skilled Christian farm workers and laborers from the Visayas and Luzon, gives Basilan a distinct culture in the Philippines. It is the only predominantly Muslim province that is governed primarily by its indigenous population and whose most commonly spoken language is Chavacano. Catholic north/northwest: J. S. Alano Street, one of the main thoroughfares of Isabela City, connecting Santa Isabel Cathedral with the Isabela City Plaza/Plaza Rizal and the Provincial Capitol. The Tausugs and Samals, for the most part having been denied ownership of land, and owing to their primary livelihood of fishing, live along the coastlines, constructing their houses on stilts at the water's edge near population centers. Their houses are, for the most part, outside of the municipal water and sewerage systems of the urban centers. This group controls nearly 100% of the bountiful aquatic resources that surround the island. The Yakans, on the other hand, having been driven far inland, are scattered throughout the island's interior, in similar raised houses usually made of light materials, but separated from each other. Yakans control nearly all Local Government Units, and since the late 80s have found employment in Government jobs. The Christians are mostly found in the plains, the cities and in the plantations, squeezed between the Tausug-dominated coasts and the Yakan-dominated hinterlands. They make up the bulk of the island's professionals, entrepreneurs, and lowland farmers. The Christians, however, own most of the arable land, as well as nearly all of the businesses and occupy most of the professions. Tausug/Samal festivals are usually connected to the sea, celebrating the bounty of the seas, even staging dazzling fluvial wedding parades on colorfully bedecked and , a nod to the Tausugs' former naval prowess. Catholic fiestas are almost always related to good harvests on the farms, as well as saintly miracles against natural calamities and victories against Moro attacks in the past. Yakan festivals, meanwhile, are rooted in older, pre-Islamic rituals such as warrior dances, colorful wedding pageants, and harvest rituals. Tausug south/southeast: Main road at Port Holland, Maluso, Basilan, flanked by Tausug traders and market stall owners. Culturally, therefore, the Chavacanos, Cebuanos, and Tausugs have had a close relationship, both professionally as well as in trade and commerce, being regarded as the island's \\"lowlanders\\" by the Yakan, who are regarded as \\"de arriba\\" by the Chavacanos or \\"tagihamas\\" by the Suluanon Tausugs, which roughly translates as \\"uplanders\\". Conversely, the Yakan have reason to be suspicious of the intents and motives of their lowland neighbors, having been at the receiving end of slave raids, invasions and punitive attacks from both groups for over 500 years. With the island's strategic location right at the crossroads of the warring camps of Tausugs and the Spanish, Basilan was divided into three primary spheres of cultural dominance by one of the three groups. Basilan's northern and northwestern coasts, facing the heavily Hispanized Zamboanga City across the narrow Basilan Strait, is culturally Christian, or more precisely Catholic. Basilan's southern and southwestern coastal areas have a distinctly Tausug-oriented culture. The eastern and interior portions of Basilan, on the other hand, isolated for the most part from the Spanish in Zamboanga, and the Tausug from Jolo, are enclaves of the indigenous Yakan. =Demographics= Basilan ethnicity profile By the eve of the Commonwealth era in the Philippines, local census estimates showed that a majority of the people of Basilan were Christian migrants, mostly plantation workers recruited from over Mindanao and the Visayas, and Tausug traders, as well as Samal and Bajau fisherfolk. Only around 5,000 Yakans were counted in the census. Until then, most Yakans preferred not to interact directly with their lowland neighbors. Statistics from the 2010 Census report () the following breakdown (out of a total 391,179 population): * Indigenous Yakan: 161,791 (41.36%) * Christians, i.e., Chavacano / Visayans (which includes Cebuano and Hiligaynon) / Ilocano, etc.: 128,698 (32.9%) * Other Muslim Tribes, i.e., Tausug / Samal / Bajao / Iranon: 100,690 (25.74%) Basilan Province population distribution (NSO figures 2010) The following figures in this subsection are from the National Statistical Coordination Board, NSCB Philippine Database, Census of 2010, unless otherwise noted. Basilan' median age was 19 years, lower than the 1995 figure of 25 years. The sex ratio is almost even. There were 166,413 males and 166,415 females in the 2000 CPH. However, there were more females in the 15-to-39 age group and more males in all other age groups. The economically active population, ages 15 to 64, comprises 55.2% of the population. About 42.3% are young dependents (0 to 14 years old) while fewer than 3% are old dependents (64 years old and older). The overall dependency ratio is 81.2: for every 100 persons ages 15 to 64, there were about 77 young dependents and 4 old dependents. Married people accounted for 47.76% of the total people 10 years old and over, lower than the 1995 figure (49.11%). Single people comprised 43.80% in 2000, a decrease from 45.71% in 1995. The widowed (4.49%) increased less than one percentage point from the figure registered in 1995 (3.89%). Those with other arrangements increased from 3.87% in 1995 to 4.49% in 2000. Out of 60,710 housing units in Basilan, 60,699 (99.98%) were occupied by 61,546 households. This rate of occupancy was higher than that of 1990 (95.6%). There was a ratio of 1.01 households for every occupied housing unit or 5.48 persons per occupied housing unit. A large proportion (94.3%) of the occupied housing units in Basilan in 2000 were single houses. 75.9% of the occupied housing units did not need repair or with minor repair, while 17.8% needed major repair. One out of nine occupied housing units was built between 1996 and 2000. The proportion of occupied housing units with roofs made of galvanized iron/aluminum rose from 23.1% in 1990 to 42.5% in 2000. On the other hand, roofs made of cogon/nipa/anahaw declined from 69.6% in 1990 to 50.3% in 2000. As for the construction material of the outer walls, the use of wood rose from 42.2% in 1990 to 52.4% in 2000. Out of Basilan's estimated 60,582 families, 19,740 lived in urban areas and 40,842 were rural. Average poverty thresholds province-wide were pegged at Php9,271.00 monthly family income, of which Php10,997.00 was considered the urban threshold and Php8,080.00 the threshold for rural families. 26.20% of the total population was below the poverty threshold: 36.50% of the urban population and 21.20% of the rural. Poverty incidence is defined as the proportion of families whose income cannot provide for the basic food and non-food requirements called the poverty threshold to the total number of families. According to the ARMM government website, in 2006, Basilan ranked 46th among all provinces, with a poverty incidence of 31.7. Population growth 2000-2007 Basilan experienced a rapid increase in population; between 2000 and 2007, the population increased by 163,675, from 332,828 to 496,503, which is an annual growth rate of , whereas it only rose by 37,263 between 1995 and 2000, an annual growth rate of . A corresponding increase in the number of households was also registered, from 55,137 in 1995 to 61,546 in 2000. This resulted to an average household size of 5.4 persons, higher than the national average of five. Of the seven original municipalities in Basilan as of May 1, 2000, Isabela, then capital of the province, was the largest in terms of population with 73,032 persons or 21.94% of the provincial total. It was followed by Lamitan (17.64%), Sumisip (15.23%), Tipo-Tipo (14.50%), and Tuburan (12.78%). Lantawan and Maluso, on the other hand, had less than 10% each. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney with the Datu Bantilan Dance Troupe in traditional Yakan costume. By 2007, the three biggest local government units (LGUs) saw their shares of the population fall relative to neighboring communities; Isabela City fell to 17.72% of Basilan's total population despite remaining the most densely populated area on the island. Lamitan is now only at 16.53% (-1.11%). Old Sumisip (two municipalities with a population of 71,807), with the biggest aggregate land area, fell to 14.46% (-0.77%). Meanwhile, Old Tipo-Tipo (three municipalities: 83,249 pop.) rose to 16.75% (+2.25%) and is now bigger than Lamitan, while Old Tuburan (three municipalities: 73,942 pop.) is 14.89% (+2.11%) and is now bigger than Old Sumisip. Old Lantawan (two municipalities: 49,270 pop.) is at 9.92%, while Maluso (48,175 pop.) comprises 9.7% of the total. The seven-year increases are widely disparate, which explains the 2000‚Äì2007 percentage figures stated above. In Isabela City, the population growth was 20.47% (+ per annum; 73,032 in 2000, to 87,985 in 2007), slower when compared to the newly created Akbar Municipality, scene of many of the latest gun-battles between government troops and Moro separatist groups. The municipality's seven-year population growth was 101.42% (+ per annum; 10,581 in 2000 to 21,312 in 2007). The average aggregate annual population increase in the seven-year period for the ten municipalities and one city that comprise Basilan was 9.12%. By comparison, that of the rest of the Philippines was only 2.3%. These figures are derived from the National Statistics and Coordination Board and Philippine Statistics Authority. These rapid growth rates have been attributed mainly to the practice of local governments of padding their real population numbers to * obtain a bigger slice of the Internal Revenue Allotment fund given to Philippine LGUs, * fulfill minimum requirements set by the Philippine Local Government Code (for the newly created municipalities and Lamitan city) *as well as a reserve of votes for local political clans from constituencies that \\"usually\\" record 100% turn-outs during election periods. Basilan Census 2010 The rapid growth between 2000 and 2007 is replaced by a drastic reduction in the 2007‚Äì2010 figures after the previous figures were subjected to stricter statistical analyses, reflecting a more statistically plausible growth trajectory from 2000 to 2010. As a result, Basilan's 2010 population declined from 496,503 to 391,179, a contraction of 105,324 or -21.21%, a PGR of . Out of Basilan's two Cities and 11 Municipalities, only two LGUs registered increases in population: * Isabela City grew from 87,985 to 97,857, an increase of 9,872 or +11.22% ( PGR); and * Tabuan Lasa grew from 13,384 to 18,635, an increase of 5,251 or +39.23% ( PGR). The rest recorded drastic declines in population: * Lamitan City, from 82,074 to 68,996, a decline of 13,078 or -14.86% ( PGR); * Sumisip, from 58,423 to 37,031, a decline of 21,392 or -36.61% ( PGR); * Maluso, from 48,175 to 33,803, a decline of 14,372 or -29.83% ( PGR); * Ungkaya Pukan, from 30,472 to 17,701, a decline of 12,771 or -41.91% ( PGR); * Lantawan, from 28,978 to 20,087, a decline of 8,891 or -30.68% ( PGR); * Tipo-Tipo, from 26,548 to 16,978, a decline of 9,570 or -36.05% ( PGR); * Tuburan, from 26,498 to 18,988, a decline of 7,519 or -28.34% ( PGR); * Al Barka, from 26,229 to 19,523, a decline of 6,706 or -25.57% ( PGR); * Hji. Mohammad Ajul, from 26,132 to 15,962, a decline of 10,170 or -38.92% ( PGR); * Akbar, from 21,312 to 13,369, a decline of 7,943 or -37.27% ( PGR); and * Hji. Muhtamad, from 20,292 to 12,249, a decline of 8,043 or -39.64% ( PGR). Basilan Census 2015 The population of Basilan in the including Isabela City was people, with a density of . When Isabela City is excluded, the population of the province is 346,579 people, with a density of . =Religion= Kaum Purnah Mosque, the oldest masjid on the island of Basilan Basilan Faith Profile The majority of Basilan's population is Muslim, accounting for 65%. The others are mostly Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), accounting for 33% of the population. A majority of Basilan's Muslim population (41%) practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, and Malay missionaries from the 14th century onwards. A substantial remainder follow a syncretist mix of Islam and Yakan folk customs and traditions exclusively among the native Yakan populations farther inland, and a different version of the same folk Islamic tradition which is practiced by the Bajao in Basilan's outlying islands and surrounding seas. A majority of Basilan's Muslims are concentrated on the island's southern slopes while Christians reside mostly in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan on the island's northern coast, where they constitute a majority. Sizable Christian settlements are also found in the former multi- national plantations, for example Tairan, Lantawan; Tumahubong, Sumisip; Maluso Townsite, Maluso. The rest have a mixture of traditional and autochthonal beliefs. Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a \\"purer\\" Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh- day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs. The Jesuit mission established in 1637 was replaced by a parish when Basilan was reassigned to the Order of Augustinian Recollects in 1850. The Jesuits regained Isabela Parish from 1860 to 1880, and then lost it again to the Recollects, who administered the parish until 1920, at which time Isabela de Basilan was turned over to diocesan priests until 1930. From 1930 through 1950, the Jesuits returned to Isabela, finally relinquishing their long-held outpost to the Claretian Fathers, who took over from 1951 to 1974. The Isabela Parish burned to the ground in 1962 and was rebuilt in 1964 under the aegis of Basilan's first bishop, Jos√© Mar√≠a Querexeta, a Spaniard. The cathedral was consecrated to Santa Isabel in 1970, and diocesan priests have since administered the same from 1974 to the present. The cathedral figured prominently in the news, suffering one destructive explosion in a triple bomb blast on April 13, 2010. The Prelature of Isabela de Basilan was created on October 12, 1963, and comprises all territories constituting the civil jurisdiction of Basilan Province, including Isabela. Its titular patron is Santa Isabel de Portugal. Bishop Querexeta was succeeded by Bishop R√≥mulo T. de la Cruz, Basilan's first Filipino bishop, on February 16, 1989, who served until January 10, 2002, when the present bishop, Martin S. Jumoad took over. =Language= Native Zamboangue√±o Chavacano speakers in Mindanao. Basilan is home to several ethnolinguistic groups who have their own native vernaculars; the main ones being Chavacano, Tausug, Yakan, and Cebuano (Bisaya). Chavacano is the primary native tongue of the Christian inhabitants of the island and serves as the lingua franca of Basilan, with 80% of residents being able to speak and understand it. Basilan has the biggest concentration of Chavacano speakers in the Philippines outside of Zamboanga City. Tausug is also widely spoken, especially among the Muslim tribes, and is spoken and understood by approximately 70% of Basilan's population. Cebuano is a preferred third tongue among the Christian tribes and even by Muslim tribes because of the mass influx of Cebuano settlers to Mindanao, especially with the Tau S≈´g since Bahasa S≈´g, is a Visayan languages and is spoken and understood by approximately 60% of residents. Yakan, the acknowledged native language of Basilan, is used primarily by Yakans, although it is spoken and understood by about 15%-20% of the non-Yakan residents. A lesser percentage can speak or understand Samal/Banguingui and Iranon, which are mostly confined to members of their respective ethnolinguistic groups. Tagalog and English are used for official business or government transactions. Hokkien Chinese is used by the immigrant Chinese community and their descendants. Arabic is mostly used in Muslim prayers and songs and seldom spoken as an everyday vernacular. =Education= Basilan National High School, Isabela, Basilan's premier secondary institution Basilan's literacy rate has risen over the past two decades, although it remains one of the Philippines' lowest; 72.23% are considered literate, as opposed to the national figure of 92.6%. The province has one state college and five private colleges. Basilan State College is located in Isabela and has an extension college in Lamitan and Maluso. Among the private colleges, there is Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela (est. 1997) and The Mariam School of Nursing in Lamitan (est. 2004). Furigay Colleges, Lamitan City, Basilan Basilan is served by three school divisions of the Department of Education, one each for Basilan, Isabela, and Lamitan. The first two are headquartered in Isabela City, and the latter is in Lamitan City. Public and private high schools dot the province. The premier secondary educational institution on the island is Basilan National High School in Isabela, followed by Lamitan National High School in Lamitan. The Claret High Schools of Isabela, Lamitan, Maluso and Tumahubong, and a number of Madaris provide private elementary and secondary instruction. Claret College of Isabela is the only Claretian institution which offers tertiary level education in the Philippines. Other schools offering stand-alone senior high school are Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela and The Mariam School of Nursing, Inc.-Lamitan. More than 42% of the population five years old and older attended or completed elementary education, 17.3% attended or completed high school, while 1.5% attended or finished post secondary education. Less than 3% possessed academic degrees, while 6.2 percent were college undergraduates. A very small number pursued post-baccalaureate studies. There were more males than females among those who attended or finished elementary (51.1%), high school (50.3%), among college undergraduates (52.0%) and those who took post baccalaureate courses (58.4%). On the other hand, there were more females who attended or completed post-secondary courses (52.9%) and were academic degree holders (52.34%). =Clubs and organizations= There are clubs and social organizations in Basilan, ranging from the Junior Chamber International Basilan Inc. (Basilan Jaycees) to the Basilan Motor Club. Economy Basilan Economic Profile Agriculture is the main source of economic livelihood. Basilan's major products include coconut (primarily copra), rubber, coffee, black pepper, and African palm oil. Other crops are palay, corn, cacao and cassava. The Sulu and Celebes Seas provide fish such as tuna, mackerel, and sardines. Most of these are processed in canning factories in nearby Zamboanga City, General Santos (the Philippines' tuna capital), and Navotas. The island's waters also produce grouper, squid, octopus, and marlin, while fishponds supply milkfish, prawn and shrimp. In addition, seaweed is cultivated along some coastal areas. The island of Omosmarata in Tuburan (now Mohammad Ajul) is listed among only 15 sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean thermal energy potential. The Philippines' ocean thermal resource area is 1000 square kilometers, based on the archipelagic nature of the country. Based on a study conducted by the Philippines Department of Energy, the potential capacity for this resource is estimated to be 265 million megawatts. Likewise, the Basilan Strait is listed among only eight sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean tidal energy potential (along with Bohol/Talibon Strait, Basiao Channel, Surigao Strait, Gaboc Channel, Hinatuan Passage, San Bernardino Strait and San Juanico Strait). Only the provinces of Basilan, Samar and Surigao have both high ocean thermal and ocean tidal energy potential. Basilan likewise has significant as yet underdeveloped mineral deposits, specifically, iron ore, gold, manganese, copper, and coal. Alienable and disposable lands cover , forest lands occupy , are underused, are under forest cultivation, while are under agricultural cultivation. Local products include woven cloth and trinkets made by the Yakan tribe. Yakans use fibers from plants such as pineapple for their crafts. The weavers traditionally used extracts from leaves, roots and barks to dye their fibers. However, contact with U.S. Peace Corps workers and Christian Filipinos has influenced Yakan textile art. One influence is the introduction of chemical dyes. The museum of Lamitan displays the colorful and intricate traditional Yakan textiles and highlights of the traditional Yakan festival, Lami-lamihan. =Early history= Basilan's economy has seen wild upswings and downturns over the course of several centuries. Pre-Hispanic Taguima had an economy based on basic subsistence agriculture, mostly root crops. Ancient Chinese texts point to the existence of a \\"Kingdom of Kumalarang\\", which presumably was located on the island's northwestern shore, and which traded occasionally with Chinese merchants plying the route to the Spice Islands of the Moluccas and Borneo farther south. When the Spanish arrived, other crops such as rice and corn were introduced and cultivated, primarily for consumption by the growing Christian settlements of Isabela and Lamitan. Trade with Zamboanga grew tremendously, as most of the settlers' needs were supplied by regular shipments from the busy Zamboanga port. =Multinational plantations= President Manuel Quezon tapping the sap of one of the trees in the pioneering Basilan rubber plantations developed by American Dr. James W. Strong. When the United States assumed control of the Philippines after its victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, it brought about the single biggest change in the local economy. By around 1914, Dr. James W. Strong, a pioneering American plantation owner, cleared vast tracts of land on the island's northern plains (Isabela/Lamitan), and established what became the Philippines' first commercial rubber plantation‚Äîthe American Rubber Co. Upon consulting with Fr. Zamora, a noted botanist of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, he decided to start experimenting with rubber plants and in 1910, forming the Basilan Rubber Plantation in partnership with J.M. Menzi Corporation as principal stock holders. Seven years later, he sold out his interest to J.M. Menzi Corporation and started American Rubber Co. backed by San Francisco capital. He started building roads in Basilan with the help of his children. Those roads are now part of the National Highway system in Basilan. The family and plantation prospered and was visited by such notables as Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, his vice-president Sergio Osme√±a, General Douglas MacArthur and assorted Governor Generals and High Commissioners for the Philippines. The 913-hectare plantation was eventually sold to American multi-national B. F. Goodrich through its local subsidiary American Rubber Plantation Corp. This was followed by investments from British-Malayan firm Sime Darby Corp., which opened their rubber plantation on the island's southern slopes (Sumisip/Tipo- Tipo). The success of these large-scale cash crop plantations was emulated by a number of enterprising Filipinos and Spanish-mestizo families from Zamboanga, Negros and Luzon. Among these were Don Juan S. Alano, a Hispano- Chinese mestizo and native of Malolos, Bulacan, who opened the Philippine National Sugar Co. on Malamawi Island in 1921. This eventually became the Basilan Estates, Inc., the only 100% Filipino-owned plantation competing with American and British multi-nationals. It operated the Malamawi Island plantation, which was converted to coconut/copra production, and opened a 1,434-hectare copra plantation on the island's western plains (Tairan, Lantawan), Basilan's third-largest plantation in land area. American logging firms Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. and the American Lumber Co. opened large-scale logging concessions which operated in Basilan's extensive upland virgin forest. Menzi Agricultural Corp., owned by Hispano-German J. M. Menzi, opened a 991-hectare rubber plantation in the southern part of Isabela which eventually expanded to black pepper and palm oil. The University of the Philippines System was awarded a huge 4,018-hectare land grant by the Philippine government, in Santa Clara, Lamitan. This was eventually taken over by the Marcos-era National Development Corp. When J. M. Menzi died, he was succeeded at the helm of his substantial business interests by his son and Marcos crony, Hans Menzi. When the younger Menzi replaced the plantation's Swiss-expatriate managers with locals, these managers in turn opened up their own plantations elsewhere on the island. Arnold Winniger, Menzi's Swiss manager, together with the Cuevas-Pamaran-Antonio-Flores clan of Lamitan, cleared the Tumahubong, Sumisip area with their 316-hectare Siltown Realty Corp. Walter Boelsterli, another one of Menzi's Swiss recruits, established the 969-hectare Eurasia Match Inc. plantation around Mangal, Sumisip. An American corporation opened the 1,127-hectare Yakan Plantation in Lamitan. This was eventually sold to JAKA Holdings of Marcos-era Defense Minister and current senator Juan Ponce Enrile. Finally, Dutch-American Donald Wieselski opened another 569-hectare coconut plantation in the Canas, Maluso area. This too was sold off to Eustaquio D. Tan & Sons, Inc. The Wihara Plantation, a Japanese company, opened in the Atong-Atong, Lantawan region. This became the source of many of the coconut varieties planted throughout the island.

By the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, the Chartered City of Basilan, fourth-biggest in the Philippines in terms of land area (after Davao, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga), was classified as a first-class city. It exported copra, coconut oil, rubber and lumber to California by way of Guam and Hawaii. A substantial number of expatriate plantation managers, mostly Americans but also Swiss, Germans, Dutch, Russian and even Japanese, Irish, and Swedes lived among and intermarried into the native populace. The Weyerhaeuser Compound (now Tabuk Barangay) was an exclusive gated community for American expatriates living in Basilan. It had its own airstrip and wharf, and two-storey plantation-style villas set apart by expansive yards. The same sort of exclusive gated communities were put up at the Menzi Compound (Menzi Barangay) for Swiss and German managers, and at the Alano Compound (Dna. Ramona T. Alano Barangay) as well, precursors of modern-day subdivisions and exclusive gated communities in the Philippines. =The Moro uprising= MNLF fighters surrender their firearms to President Ferdinand Marcos. The Moro uprising of 1971 affected Basilan's economy. It was led by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) originating from Sulu, headed by University of the Philippines lecturer Nur Misuari. This was compounded by the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and the decree that created Basilan Province, with its initial complement of ten municipalities (eventually reduced to seven). Politics took center stage, and the resurgent Yakan uplanders found themselves battling the Tausug lowlanders and their allies. The incessant Yakan-Tausug pocket battles throughout the 1980s culminated in the burning of Isabela City's downtown market in 1987. After several revenge killings, Basilan gained notoriety as the Philippines' \\"Wild, Wild West\\". By then, Basilan's economy, along with that of the rest of the nation, was limping along, barely surviving the aftermath of these struggles. =Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program and the rise of Abu Sayyaf= At the onset of the post-Marcos administration of Corazon Aquino, another blow was dealt to Basilan's economy. In 1988, Congress passed a law establishing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), which inaugurated a land distribution program, effectively dissolving nearly all of the corporate plantations on the island. CARP applied to Basilan's large multi-national plantations despite the plantation workers' misgivings and the landowners' objections. Almost immediately, the large multi-national corporations withdrew their investments from Basilan, leaving their plantations to ill-equipped farmer beneficiaries, who managed operations in a farmers cooperative format. Agrarian Reform Cooperatives of Basilan, Philippines The J. S. Alano coconut plantation was converted into the Tairan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association and Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TARBAMC), the University of the Philippines Basilan Land Grant into the Santa Clara Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Integrated Development Cooperative (SCARBIDC), and the American Rubber (B.F. Goodrich) rubber plantation was converted into the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association Inc. (LARBAI). The vast tracts of the Enrile-owned Cocoland Plantation, was redistributed as the Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (LARBECO). A number of other Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives have likewise taken over most of the small to mid-sized plantations on the island. The Philippine government's initial rapprochement with the Nur Misuari-led Moro National Liberation Front throughout the 1980s established the 7,281-hectare Basilan Resettlement Area which was set aside for MNLF rebel- returnees and their communities located on the western slopes of Basilan Peak, mostly in northern Sumisip, but also in southern Isabela, and northeastern Maluso. This vast area was eventually subdivided into four Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, all of which were established in 1991. Political map of Zamboanga Peninsula By the early 1990s, disgruntled youth, influenced by returning mujahideen warriors from the thwarted Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and schooled in more radical schools of thought in Syria, Egypt and Pakistan, banded together to form the Al-Harakatul Al-Islamiyah, better known worldwide as Abu Sayyaf, an extremist group advocating strict Islamic governance similar to Afghanistan's Taliban regime. This group initiated test raids, kidnappings, ambushes and assassinations in some of the more vulnerable communities inland, causing the dispersal of these communities and total breakdown of the inland economy. As more and more of the group's pioneering leaders were captured or gunned down, the group gradually transformed from being radical ideologues to becoming plain lawless elements or bandits, prone to committing heinous crimes, usually kidnapping for ransom and bombings throughout Mindanao, Palawan (Dos Palmas) and even Malaysia (Sipadan Is.). The group's founding leader, the radical firebrand Abdurajak Janjalani of Isabela City, is a typical product of Basilan's closely mixed ethnicities and inter-marriages: he is part-Tausug, part-Yakan and part-Ilonggo. =Inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao= The Organic Act for the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was passed into law in 1989. A plebiscite held in 14 Mindanao provinces was held in the same year. Basilan initially opted out of the autonomous region. Only Maguindanao (without Cotabato City), Lanao del Sur (without Marawi City), Sulu and Tawi-Tawi joined the ARMM. More than a decade later, in 2001, a new law expanding the ARMM was passed, and a plebiscite was subsequently held. While Basilan's five Muslim municipalities (Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan) opted to join the expanded ARMM, residents of the Christian areas of Isabela City and Lamitan Municipality, chose not to. Even then, only Isabela was not included in the expanded ARMM, having been granted cityhood earlier in the same year. Lamitan joined the five other municipalities, as Basilan was officially incorporated into the expanded ARMM. Basilan security profile Widespread corruption in the ARMM, compounded by corruption at the municipal and provincial levels, further eroded business confidence in the island. This, plus the surge of terrorist activities carried out by Abu Sayyaf and their Jemaah Islamiyah cohorts in the international terrorist network of Al-Qaeda, weakened Basilan's economy further. The hostage crisis of 2001 further raised questions about Basilan's economic future. Operations by Abu Sayyaf damaged prospects for investment and tourism. However, an increased presence by the Philippine and U.S. militaries through the Balikatan 02-1 Joint Military Exercises and the subsequent death of Abu Sayyaf leaders Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani and Aldam Tilao (aka Abu Sabaya), were followed by investments by the United States through USAID. Projects include the Basilan Tuburan Road Improvement Project and improvements to Lamitan and Maluso Ports. Smaller barangay infrastructure projects, intended to help boost economic growth, are also under development. For instance, authorities are building farm-to-market roads, community and trade centers, water projects, and pedestrian bridges, according to USAID information. A number of other ODA-funded Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and People's Organizations (POs) flooded Basilan starting in 2002. These NGOs and POs provided much-needed capital infusion for local entrepreneurs to restart defunct or dying business enterprises. Likewise, improved training and government-funded support were extended to decade-old Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives, effectively improving productivity levels and crop yields. Extensive farm management training in these \\"Coop\\" areas have likewise improved business efficiency in the cooperatives. Currently, Basilan's minimum wage is US$3.20/day for non-agriculture related jobs, and US$2.80/day for agriculture related jobs. There are only 1,203 registered Overseas Contract Workers from Basilan. =Return of rubber= Worker in a rubber producing plantation. By 2003, Basilan embarked on large- scale replanting programs covering some of privately owned and/or cooperative- controlled lands, mainly for rubber and cassava. , the province had planted, of which were owned by individual farmers and the rest by cooperatives. The exact land area devoted to rubber could reach over , as there are hundreds of unrecorded small rubber growers and farmers. The provincial government reports that almost half or are immature, about a fifth or is classed as \\"less- productive\\", and a little under a third or is described as \\"productive.\\" A consortium of agrarian reform beneficiaries has been formed to improve quality and increase production. The Isla Corridor Consortium Agrarian Reform Communities not only sees itself as reviving the rubber industry, it also wants to help in the transformation of the battle-scarred province. The consortium, composed of the United Workers Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Multipurpose Cooperative, Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative, Santa Clara, and the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association, Inc., accounts for a total area of about , some 80% of which is planted with rubber trees. =Coconut= Copra processing plant in Isabela City, Basilan Although it is still the biggest single crop produced in the province, coconut/copra production annually was only 193,848 metric tons in 2003, down from its peak production of 189,297,937 metric tons just two years before. Coconut plantations and small coconut farms cover more than , all of which are classified as \\"productive\\" to \\"mature\\" areas. However, province-wide coconut production, which still accounts for 50%-60% of the province's total economic activity, has dropped precipitously to only 174,939 metric tons in 2002 due to the lingering effects of CARP, combined with a severe onset of the El Ni√±o weather pattern, the worsening threat to peace and order resulting from the resurgent Abu Sayyaf terrorist group and their MILF allies, and the policy of the Akbar administration to replace coconut with rubber trees. Coconut plantations began to revive in 2006, owing to the steep rise in copra prices. A comprehensive replanting and rehabilitation program is currently being implemented by the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the Department of Agriculture for the resuscitation of the island's copra production industry, once the Philippine's second-largest copra exporter after Quezon Province in Luzon. To date, however, coconut production in the province, rapidly being replaced by rubber plantations, has remained in the doldrums despite the government's best efforts to revive the ailing sector, such as PCA incentives to coconut farmers. =Other products= Samal fishers engaged in lobster culture, a project of USAID GEM on Malamawi Island, Isabela City. Basilan's extensive coastline hosts seafarers and fishers, almost all of them Tausugs, Samals and Bajaus, who have been engaged in fishing for several centuries. Annual Basilan fish production is limited to 28,073 metric tons due to resistance to the modernizing of their fishing fleets. Only 2,945 metric tons of palay (rice) are produced in Basilan's mostly rolling terrain. Corn production is 1,333 metric tons, bananas 20,458 metric tons, and mangos 211 metric tons. There are 155,541 chickens, 5,085 ducks, 7,803 carabaos (water buffalo), 2,724 cattle, 14,470 goats, and 14,700 hogs. =Banking and finance= Banks based in Basilan have a total deposit base of more than Php764,500,000. The city hosts at least 27 pawnshop operations, each of whom has an average of three branches, mostly located in Isabela City, Lamitan, and Maluso Townsite. The province is also serviced by satellite offices of government financing institutions such as the Social Security System and the Government Service Insurance System. The Basilan business sector is represented by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Inc.-Basilan Chamber (PCCI-Basilan), organized in 1975, the only business support organization duly affiliated with the Philippine Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Inc. (PCCI), with 95% of its members being composed of small and medium enterprises, and offices mostly in Isabela City and Lamitan, but with business assets and operations throughout the island. A number of smaller business groups have since been established catering to the needs of businessmen from specific ethnic or religious affiliations. =Utilities, infrastructure and health= Basilan's electricity needs are served by the Basilan Electric Cooperative, powered by three diesel-powered electricity generating plants located at Barangay Binuangan, Isabela, one National Power Corporation diesel-powered barge located at Barangay Tabuk, Isabela, and two mini-hydroelectric plants located in Kumalarang, Isabela and Balagtasan, Lamitan. A total of 62 sitios, in 42 barangays spread out in 6 municipalities still do not have access to electricity. Only about 38% of Barangays are sufficiently powered for modern needs, and most of these are located in the cities of Isabela and Lamitan, and Maluso Municipality. Rates are currently pegged at US$0.824/kwH (Php11.42/kwH), one of the highest in the country. Basilan has a total electricity demand of 8.8MW (peak hours), and has a total reliable electricity supply of only 7.4MW, thus resulting in one of the country's longest intermittent blackout spells, running for several years now. Basilan is served by three local water utilities: Isabela City Water District, Lamitan City Water District, and Maluso Water District. Only 17,693 households, however, have full access to safe and potable water. Current rates are pegged at an average US$3.20/month (+US$0.0826/10 cu.m.) The island is served by the Provincial Telephone System, which has 600 land-line connections and connected with National Direct Dial via the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. It is also served by major mobile telecommunications carriers Globe Telecommunications and Smart Communications. It has two Wi-Fi internet service providers, and numerous internet cafes. Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc. (former Basilan Hospital), the first private hospital in Basilan, opened in 1953. National roads (concrete, asphalt, gravel) total , while there are of local roads. There are 13 municipal and local ports, three of which have roll-on/roll-off capability, and at least ten private airstrips servicing small aircraft. Major bridges are the Marcos Bridge of Isabela and the recently inaugurated Matarling Bridge (built through USAID funding) between Isabela and Lantawan. There are 394 Barangay Health Workers and four private hospitals: the Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital (formerly Basilan Hospital), Infante Hospital, Basilan Community Hospital, all in Isabela, and the Dr. Jose Ma. Torres Hospital in Lamitan. There are also four government- run hospitals: Basilan General Hospital and Isabela City Infirmary, both located in Isabela City, the Lamitan District Hospital in Lamitan City, and the Sumisip District Hospital in Luuk-Bait, Sumisip Municipality. Tourism Architectural landmarks include the Santa Isabel Cathedral, the Calvario Peak, on which the Chapel of Peace stands, and the Kaum Purnah Mosque. Natural attractions include the lake in the Panigayan fishing village, Sumagdang Beach and the waterfalls of the Kumalarang River. Cultures can be visited, such as the Badjao, the Yakan, and the Muslim communities.

His descendants include the prominent Cuevas-Pamaran-Antonio clan. * Museo ng Lamitan, which showcases the Lami-lamihan festival. It also serves as the information center for Lamitan. Old Basilan Provincial Capitol, former site of Fort Isabella Segunda * Old Basilan Provincial Capitol, site of Fort Isabela II. The original fort was bombed and destroyed towards the end of World War II, having been used by the occupying Japanese forces as a munitions dump. A newer Capitol Building was built on the spot where the old Basilan City Hall stood after it was burned in the early 1990s. The new building is a celebration of Muslim and Christian influences which shaped modern-day Basilan, and still occupies the highest point of the city proper. * Isabela City Plaza (formerly Plaza Misericordia) /Plaza Rizal. The twin plazas of the city have remained at the very center of Basilan's socio-political scene to this very day. =Fiestas and festivals= * Pakaradjaan Basilan, celebrated annually from March 1 to March 7 to commemorate the founding anniversary of the Province of Basilan. * Lami-Lamihan Festival, the island's premier festival, is celebrated during the Feast of St. Peter (Fiesta San Pedro) on June 29 in Lamitan City. The festival is highlighted by the Yakans, who attend the festivities in full regalia, selling wares and produce brought in from their farms in the interior. Lami-Lamihan Festival, Lamitan, Basilan * 'Cocowayan' Festival, Isabela's annual commemoration of its cityhood, is a week-long series of activities culminating in the annual Street Dancing parade on April 25. * Fiesta Santa Isabel, celebrated every July 8 by the residents of Isabela, in honor of its Patroness Saint, Elizabeth of Portugal (Span. Santa Isabel de Portugal). The focal point of the celebrations is the Santa Isabel Cathedral, located at the center of Isabela City. This is highlighted by a procession and novena masses, the traditional Bella Isabela Beauty Pageant, a marathon, a regatta and other activities organized primarily by the Diocese of Basilan and the Prelature of Isabela and its lay organizations, the Catholic Women's League and the Knights of Columbus. * Semana Santa (Holy Week), celebrated in March/April (movable). A city procession known as the Santo Entierro (Holy Funeral) on Good Friday highlights the observance of Lent. Celebrated in most parish churches in the city and in the Santa Isabel Cathedral, the Santo Entierro is a procession of Christ's images, many of the Stations of the Cross along the city's main streets, depicting his last hours before, during, and after the Crucifixion. * Flores de Mayo (May 1‚Äì31). A religious feast celebrated in all Catholic churches in honor of the Virgin Mary. Little children in white gala dresses walk up the altar to offer flowers to the image of the Virgin Mary. Farmland Resort, Lanote, Isabela, Basilan * Fonda de Barangay or Fiestas del Barangay, a week-long celebration in the barangays/barrios honoring their patron saints. The celebration usually starts with novena masses held every day for nine straight days before the feast day of the patron saint. Every night, the barrio is lit up for celebration and merry-making that includes pageants, trade fair, parade, cock-fighting, carnival, musical competition and \\"baile.\\" * Budbud Festival, a barangay fiesta in honor of Nuestra Senora dela Regla of Begang Barangay, otherwise known as Isabela's \\"Little Cebu\\", a majority of whose residents originated from Carmen, Cebu Province.

Politics Basilan's politics has been dictated by its economics. Whereas only 33% of the island's residents originate from Christian tribes in the Visayas and Luzon, this group owns 70% of the island's developed arable agricultural land (private ownership or cooperatives as farmer beneficiaries). The Yakan tribe, comprising 41% of the island's population, has full control of local governments outside of Isabela and Lamitan. The Tausugs, Samals and Bajaus, forming 25% of the population, control nearly 90% of the island's aquatic harvest, while the minuscule Chinese segment of the population controls nearly 100% of all commodity trading and commerce activities, especially in the bigger cities. This volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups have defined political realignments in the island for most of its history. The Christian tribes, traditionally allied with the Tausugs, controlled Basilan politics until the 1980s, when the Yakans, aided by their almost absolute control of the hinterlands and the disappearance of the multi-national plantations, scored upset victories in electoral contests starting in 1988. Present-day Isabela City Plaza (formerly Plaza Misericordia; note the Rizal monument and Plaza Rizal in the background) This political combine has since seen some in- fighting from two of the most formidable power blocks to have formed since the 2004 general elections. Both blocks went head-to-head in the 2007, 2010 and 2013 local elections with mixed results. The Akbar block (Liberal Party - Atienza Wing & Lakas-CMD/Kampi) was led by the late Wahab Akbar, three-term Basilan governor and clan patriarch, together with his wives, and his nephews and nieces, all of whom won mayoral posts in all the municipalities as well as Isabela City, which is under his second wife Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar. Hja. Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, the incumbent three-term Governor of Basilan assumed the leadership of the block after Wahab Akbar himself, who was elected congressman in 2007, was assassinated in November 13 of that year. Cases were filed against Gerry Salapuddin ang Mujiv Hataman, having been accused of having master-minded the assassination. The 2013 Elections proved the staying power of the Akbars as the clan, celebrating the twin victories of both Governor Jum and Mayor Cherry, heralded the election of Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez, eldest daughter of Gov. Akbar, as the top-notcher Provincial Board Member for District 1, and Al Qaid Akbar, eldest son, who won as Isabela City Councilor. The Akbars won all of their electoral contests since 1998. Gov. Jum Akbar won in all Cities and Municipalities in Basilan, except Hdji. Muhtamad (Pilas) in the last election, with an electoral landslide of over 60,000 votes against her only opponent. This is her third and final term as governor. Mayor Cherry Santos-Akbar likewise won handily in Isabela for a third and final term in that City. The Hataman block (Liberal Party) - Roxas/Aquino Wing) is led by Mujiv Hataman, elected Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in 2013, a close friend and ally of Philippine President Benigno Simeon Aquino III. He is joined by his brother, Rep. Hajiman Hataman- Salliman, Congressman of the Lone District of Basilan, and his wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin-Hataman who won a seat as a Party-list representative in Congress, representing Anak Mindanao Party-list. They are joined by a number of clan members who likewise won local positions, especially in their bailiwick of Sumisip Municipality in Basilan. The Hatamans can boast of a mixed bag of electoral victories and defeats since 2004. Mujiv Hataman is in his first term as Regional Governor of ARMM, Cong. Jim Salliman is on his second term as Representative, and Cong. Sitti Djalia Hataman is on her first. The Salapuddin block (Lakas-CMD/Kampi) is led by Abdulgani \\"Gerry\\" Salapuddin, three-term governor, three-term congressman and two-term Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. To him, the 2007, 2010 and 2013 elections proved to be a d√©b√¢cle, as he and his daughter - Rabia Salapuddin (who ran for governor in 2013) lost on all fronts. The Salapuddins have lost all elections since 2007. The Akbars and Hatamans forged a political alliance in 2012, paving the way for the appointment of Mujiv Hataman to the top post at the ARMM. The criminal case against Hataman was voluntarily dropped by the Akbars in 2012, while the Supreme Court threw out the case filed against Salapuddin in 2013. Both Akbar and Hataman coalitions are currently affiliated with the Liberal Party of the Philippines, led by President Aquino. Salapuddin has remained with Lakas-CMD. =Current officeholders= * Governor: Hadjiman S. Hataman- Salliman * Vice Governor: Yusop T. Alano * Provincial board members: :1st District board members ::1.

Masid Yacub, Indigenous Peoples' Sectoral Representative =Recent local elections= As a result of the 2010 Synchronized National and Local Elections, three major factions emerged: the Akbar block, still formidable, albeit splintered and severely weakened from within after the assassination of clan patriarch, Rep. Wahab Akbar, of the Administration Lakas-Kampi-CMD; the Hataman block, suddenly a potent force to be reckoned with province-wide, under the new administration's Liberal Party; and a third force headed by former Akbar ally and Ungkaya Pukan Mayor Joel T. Maturan, of the Nacionalista Party and former Lakas-CMD stalwart Salapuddin. Slain Congressman Wahab Akbar's first wife Jum Jainuddin-Akbar casting her vote during the May 2007 elections. Incumbent governor Hja. Jum Jainuddin- Akbar won the gubernatorial race, defeating Mujiv Hataman, with Ungkaya Pukan Mayor and former Akbar ally Joel T. Maturan trailing far behind. The lone congressional district of Basilan, on the other hand, was won by Hajiman Salliman Hataman (LP), who had been defeated by Wahab Akbar in 2007, followed closely by former Deputy Speaker Abdulghani Salapuddin (NP), Lantawan Mayor and Wahab Akbar's niece, Tahira Ismael-Sansawi (PMP), Maluso Mayor Sakib Salajin (Lakas-Kampi-CMD), also a nephew of Wahab Akbar and Rajam M. Akbar, Wahab Akbar's sister. In the cities, incumbents Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar (Lakas- Kampi-CMD) of Isabela and Roderick Furigay (LDP) of Lamitan both won their respective contests. Isabela City's vice mayoral race proved to be hotly contested, with Tabuk Barangay Chairman Abdulbaki Ajibon winning over the incumbent in a close fight. Lamitan's incumbent Vice Mayor Arleigh Eisma ran unopposed. The election season once again witnessed a spike in crime, most noticeably a rise in kidnappings, assassinations and ambuscades. On January 29, 2009, at 5:00pm, Al Barka Mayor Karam Jakilan was felled in an ambush, together with two of his personal bodyguards. Earlier, a slew of assassinations in both the Akbar and Hataman camps, most prominently an Akbar henchman and two Hataman cousins, commenced early in 2008. Also, a spate of kidnaps for ransom have been widely observed to peak as election season nears. On April 13, 2010, two bomb blasts rocked Isabela, the first at the Basilan National High School Grandstand Oval, the second right beside Santa Isabel Cathedral. A third controlled explosion was detonated by elements of the Philippine National Police Bomb Squad a few meters from the Isabela City Hall. This was followed by the massacre of twelve residents of Theresa Heights Subdivision, Barangay Eastside, as the bombers, purportedly members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf, escaped from a porous Philippine military cordon. Local elections have been widely fraught with massive cheating, vote buying and fraud as well. Blame could not be assigned to one particular group or political block alone, as this has been a \\"common practice\\" across the political spectrum. The May 2010 automated elections turned out to be no different, with Basilan being designated an \\"Election Hotspot\\" by the Philippines' Election Commission. Violent confrontations between political supporters of rival parties, and the failure of Board of Election Inspectors in two villages in Maluso and Al-Barka Municipalities forced authorities to declare a \\"Failure of Elections\\" in these parts. Special elections were conducted in these villages on June 3, 2010, where incidents of fraud and minor scuffles were again observed. May 2013 saw a rematch between the Akbar Block (led by incumbent governor, Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, now affiliated with the administration Liberal Party - LP), against Salapuddin (led by a young Rabia Salapuddin, daughter of former governor and Congressman Abdulgani \\"Gerry\\" Salapuddin, Lakas-CMD). In this electoral contest, the Akbars allied with erstwhile political rivals, the Hatamans (led by Mujiv Hataman, who ran as Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and his brother, Rep. Jim Hataman-Salliman, Liberal Party), resulting in one of the most lop-sided election landslides in recent memory. Governor Akbar won her re-election bid with a record-breaking 60,000-vote margin against her only challenger, the younger Salapuddin. She is joined by Vice Governor Keemhar Jay Reynon Sakkalahul (LP) who bested a field of five Vice-Gubernatorial contenders. The son of former Basilan Vice Governor Al- Rasheed Sakkalahul, the new Vice Governor is currently the youngest Vice Governor in the Philippines, at 23 years old. Mayor Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar also won another lopsided victory in Isabela City. The Akbar Block has likewise added two new contenders, the Governor's children - daughter Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez - who topped the Provincial Board Members' tally for District I, while son Al Qaid Akbar managed a third-place debut in local politics as an Isabela City Councilor. The provincial sweep of the Liberal Party was complete in 2013. All winning Provincial Board Members, from Districts 1 and 2 came from the LP, while 11 of 13 Mayors are LP members. LP ARMM Standard-bearer Mujiv Hataman also won his own contest in the autonomous region - making him the first Basile√±o to win the region's top post in an election. LP re- electionist Congressman Jim Hataman-Salliman, his brother, likewise reclaimed his seat in Congress. Moreover, Basilan-founded Anak Mindanao Party-list is returned to the House of Representatives, with Mujiv Hataman's wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin Hataman, becoming a Party-list Representative. Elder brother Gulam Hataman is returned unopposed as Sumisip Mayor. =List of former governors= Governors after People Power Revolution 1986: Vice Governors after People Power Revolution 1986: =Bellwether Province= In the last five presidential elections, Basilan voted for Ferdinand Edralin Marcos (1965, 1969), Corazon Cojuangco Aquino (1986), Fidel Valdez Ramos (1992), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1998), and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2004), all of whom won in their respective bids. Similarly, Basilan's vice presidential choices, namely Fernando Lopez (1969), Salvador Laurel (1986), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1992), Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (1998) and Noli De Castro (2004), also won, making it one of the most accurate bellwether provinces in Philippine politics today. Sen. Manuel Roxas II was Basilan's Senate top-notcher in 2004, while Sen. Loren Legarda was number one in 2007. The recently conducted May 2010 national/local polls manifested once again Basilan's uncanny record of picking the winners, Benigno S. Aquino III (Liberal Party) and Jejomar C. Binay (PDP- Laban) won in the presidential and vice presidential contests in the Province respectively. However, Basilan has figured prominently in a number of election-related issues in the past, the foremost being its inclusion among the provinces (together with Cebu and the rest of the ARMM provinces) where, allegedly, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo committed wholesale election fraud to win the 2004 presidential elections. The ensuing imbroglio, dubbed the \\"Hello Garci\\" Scandal, included several mentions of Basilan and its late governor, Wahab Akbar, in taped conversations purportedly between President Arroyo and COMELEC Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano. Flora and fauna The island chain is one of two partial land bridges to Borneo and is an important migration route for birds. Among the species of flora and fauna found in Basilan are: =Mammals= *The Basilan flying squirrel (Petinomys crinitus), a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae.

Each gave their own vision of the events in New York City during the September 11 attacks, in a short film of 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and one frame. The original concept and production of the film was by French producer Alain Brigand. It has been released internationally with several different titles, depending on the language. It is listed in the Internet Movie Database as 11'09\\"01 - September 11, while in French, it is known as 11 minutes 9 secondes 1 image and in Persian as 11-e-Septambr. Plot Eleven episodes of eleven different directors on the tragedy of September 11, 2001, each lasting 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame: 11'09\\"01. = Episode # 01: \\" Iran\\" = * 'Direction' : Samira Makhmalbaf The news of the September 11, 2001 attacks reaches an Afghan refugee camp, where bricks are produced to build new shelters, in view of the attacks promised by the United States. Here a young teacher tries to explain to her young students what happened and to make them respect a minute of silence in honor of the victims. Attempts, however, fail one after another. Finally, the teacher finds herself having to impose the minute of silence on the children near a chimney (the most similar to a skyscraper). = Episode # 02: \\" France\\" = * 'Direction' : Claude Lelouch New York, September 11, 2001: a young French photographer deaf-mute is a guest of her fianc√©, a tourist guide for the disabled who is about to bring a group to visit the Twin Towers. After she tried to explain to him that a story \\"at a distance\\" like theirs has no chance of succeeding, he tries to leave a message to the computer before leaving explaining that only a miracle can keep them together. At that moment he returns home covered in dust, miraculously escaping the attack. = Episode # 03: \\" Egypt\\" = * 'Direction' : Youssef Chahine New York, September 10, 2001: director Yusuf Shahin is finalizing the filming of a film at the World Trade Center, but is sent away with his crew in a decisive manner by a policeman because he has no authorization to stay there. Two days later, Shahin presented himself at a press conference, but said he was upset by the attacks and asked to be able to postpone it, triggering the reaction of a journalist. While he is on the cliff in front of the house, the ghost of a young American soldier appears to him, who died in attack on multinational forces in Lebanon in 1983. The soldier reveals to Shahin that he is the only one who can see him, because he is the only one who can hear and understand what is going on around. The two face a \\"journey\\" that leads them to analyze the roots of the clash between the United States and the Arab world, starting from the house of the young Arab who was the executor material of the attack. After observing his preparation, Shahin discusses with his parents, who say they are proud of what he has done and go on to complain of the constant violence suffered by the Palestinians by Israel. The soldier reacts by saying that, although he understands the attacks against the soldiers, it is still not right to shoot in the pile. The director counters by showing the list of victims of US military interventions and wars after the Second World War, not justifying the violence but complaining about the United States' inability to understand that the legitimate defense of their principles often goes through the destruction of other countries . Their path ends at Arlington National Cemetery, where Shahin finds his girlfriend and the young soldier's father, who turns out to be the policeman who drove him away from the Twin Towers and with whom he reconciles. Shortly thereafter, the phantom of the attacker appears, who resolutely reproaches the director for appearing too good with that soldier. Shahin replies that both are victims of human stupidity, but the attacker responds by reiterating his position once again and showing he does not want to understand, leaving the director stunned by his uncompromising words. = Episode # 04: \\" Bosnia-Herzegovine\\" = * 'Direction' : Danis Tanoviƒá Despite the attacks in New York, a girl from Srebrenica considers it appropriate to celebrate the monthly demonstration anyway, in memory of the massacre of the local population by Bosnian Serb soldiers, which took place on July 11, 1995. = Episode # 05: \\" Burkina Faso\\" = * 'Direction' : Idrissa Ou√©draogo Ouagadougou, September 2001: Adam√† is a boy who is forced to leave school and work as a newsboy in order to be able to pay for medicines to his sick mother. Two weeks after the attacks, Adam√† sees a man very similar to Osama bin Laden and decides to capture him with the help of his friends, in order to claim the size of 25 million pending on his boss. The boys decide to use that money to treat Adam√†'s mother and, potentially, many other sick people in the country, as well as not to say anything to the adults, to prevent them from wasting the money of the size. The boys steal the camera of one of their parents and start to follow \\"Osama bin Laden\\" to a clearing where, every day, he goes to pray. The five therefore devise a plan to capture him in that clearing, but \\"bin Laden\\" does not show up that day. The boys try to capture him at the hotel, but they discover that the man is now going to the airport, where they are stopped by the policeman before they could enter. In the end, the boys decide to sell the camera and give Adam√† the money, so he can look after his mother and go back to school. = Episode # 06: \\" United Kingdom\\" = * 'Direction' : Ken Loach Pablo, a Chilean refugee in London, writes a letter to the families of the victims of the September 11 attacks, reminding them of \\"his\\" September 11: Chilean coup of 1973, when the general Augusto Pinochet implemented a coup d'√©tat (backed by the US) against Salvador Allende, democratically elected president in 1970. Pablo narrates in his letter of US involvement in financing of right-wing and subversive groups, up to the coup, and of the violence and torture suffered by him and his countrymen. Forced to first five years in prison and then into exile, he declares that he can no longer return to Chile because his family and children are now born and raised in the United Kingdom. Pablo concludes his letter with the hope that, as he will unite in the memory of the victims of September 11, 2001, so they will join him in memory of the victims of September 11, 1973. = Episode # 07: \\" Mexico\\" = * 'Direction' : Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu Black screen. Background noises and rumors of everyday life, suddenly interrupted by the screams of the witnesses of the crash of flight AA11 against the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While the black screen is occasionally interrupted by the repertoire images of the attacks, the voices of the announcements on television, the screams of the victims, the explosions of the planes, the calls made by the victims and their relatives overlap. The sound stops and you can see the two towers collapse without sound. The background voices start again on a background of violins, while the screen gradually changes from black to white. Two writings appear (one in Arabic characters and one in Latin characters) of the same meaning: \\"Does God's light guide us or blind us?\\" The sentences finally disappear in a blinding light. = Episode # 08: \\" Israel\\" = * 'Direction' : Amos Gitai A suicide attack shakes Tel Aviv. Soldiers, policemen and doctors for various, long minutes try to coordinate the operations of security and rescue. A journalist and her crew arrive at the scene and try in every way to obtain information from the police forces present, obtaining only peremptory invitations to clear the area. At one point, the director tells the journalist that she won't go on the air and she reacts first by protesting, then starting to rattle off various historical events that took place all on September 11. While the journalist insists on carrying out her service, the voice of the director is heard in the background telling her that something very serious happened in New York, to the point of explicitly saying \\"remember this date, September 11th, because it is a date that nobody more will forget \\". Faced with the further (but now unintelligible) protests of the journalist, the director replies \\"I'm not talking to you about September 11th of '44 or '97, I'm talking about September 11th today\\". = Episode # 09: \\" India\\" = * 'Direction' : Mira Nair A Pakistani woman has not heard from her son Salman since the day of the attacks on the Twin Towers. CIA and FBI repeatedly question her, since they believe the young man, of Muslim faith, could be linked to the attacks. In particular, they ask many questions about why he did not show up for work that day and why, despite having decided to pursue a medical career and leave the police academy, he still held the latter's card. While the woman does not resign herself to the disappearance of her son, the media begin to report the news of her involvement in the attack, which does nothing but exacerbate the isolation in which the woman and the family have fallen. Only after six months, the boy's remains are identified among those found among the rubble and the truth is re-established: it turns out that the young man died while he was helping at the site of the attacks. During the funeral, the mother denounces the climate of suspicion that has been created against her family and against the Muslim community in the United States. = Episode # 10: \\" United States of America\\" = * 'Direction' : Sean Penn An elder spends his life alone in an apartment overshadowed by the Twin Towers. The widowed man vents his loneliness by talking to his late wife as if she were still alive and cultivating her flower pot, withered by the lack of light. The collapse of the Towers finally allows the light to flood the apartment and suddenly revitalizes the flowers. The elder, happy for what happened, tries to show the vase to his wife, but the light \\"reveals\\" the illusion in which he lived until then. Between tears, he regrets that his wife is not there to finally see the vase bloom again. = Episode # 11: \\" Japan\\" = * 'Direction' : Sh≈çhei Imamura Japan, August 1945. Yoichi, a soldier returned from the front suffering from post-traumatic disorder, behaves like a snake, to the dismay of his parents and his wife. His family tries to convince him to return to the \\"human\\" state, but without success. The other villagers begin to look at them with suspicion and fear, but this does not prevent Yoichi's wife from having an extra-marital relationship. While the wife and her lover talk about the traumatic experiences that the soldier must have suffered, of the new type of bomb used in the bombing of Hiroshima and the forthcoming end of the war, the situation worsens: Yoichi swallows a mouse under the horrified eyes of his mother, who decides to chase him away. In the following days, the villagers suffer the loss of various animals and everyone blames the mad soldier. It is thus decided to organize a search operation to find it, but without success. Meanwhile, a flashback clarifies the reason for the soldier's behavior: hiding behind a boulder after a violent battle, Yoichi is beaten by a fellow soldier who asks him why he does not take part in this \\"holy war\\". During the hunt, Yoichi's wife accidentally finds her husband drinking water from a river and asks him \\"do you dislike being a man so much?\\" Yoichi, in response, crawls away ignoring his wife. Finally, a snake is shown above a river stone, while the inscription in Japanese \\"Holy wars do not exist\\" appears.

Moyer; Margaret B. Moyer; Larry Sowder; Judith Threadgill-Sowder (1984) Story Problem Formats: Verbal versus Telegraphic Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, Vol. 15, No. 1. (Jan., 1984), pp. 64-68.  Example  The most common types of word problems in elementary algebra are distance problems, age problems, work problems, percentage problems, mixtures problems and numbers problems. A typical age problem: > Ann is three times as old as her little brother Bob. In five years, she will > be only twice as old. How old are they now? To solve this by algebra, one first translates the words into mathematical variables, operations, and equations: * Write Ann's age as the variable A, and Bob's age as B. * Their ages five years from now are A+5 and B+5. * Twice as old means one age equals two times another, and similarly for three times. The problem thus becomes: > Solve the system of equations A = 3B and A+5 = 2(B+5) for variables A,B. The answer is A = 15, B = 5, or in ordinary language: Ann is fifteen years old, and Bob is five.  Structure  Word problems such as the above can be examined on three levels:Perla Nesher Eva Teubal (1975)Verbal Cues as an Interfering Factor in Verbal Problem Solving Educational Studies in Mathematics, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Mar., 1975), pp. 41-51. :* A. The verbal formulation; :* B. The underlying mathematical relations; :* C. The symbolic mathematical expression. Linguistic properties can include such metrics as the number of words in the problem or the mean sentence length.Madis Lepik (1990) Algebraic Word Problems: Role of Linguistic and Structural Variables, Educational Studies in Mathematics, Vol. 21, No. 1. (Feb., 1990), pp. 83-90., One scheme to analyze the logico-mathematical properties is to classify the numerical quantities in the problem into known quantities (values given in the text), wanted quantities (values to be found) and auxiliary quantities (values found as intermediate stages of the problem).  Purpose and use  Word problems commonly include mathematical modelling questions, where data and information about a certain system is given and a student is required to develop a model. For example: # Jane had $5.00, then spent $2.00. How much does she have now? # In a cylindrical barrel with radius 2 m, the water is rising at a rate of 3 cm/s. What is the rate of increase of the volume of water? These examples are intended to lead students to develop mathematical models on their own, and to promote mathematical interest and understanding by analyzing real-life situations. The relevance of these problems to students varies. The first example is known even to primary school students, and is often used to teach the concept of subtraction. The second example presents a high school student with the challenge of translating the problem into symbolic form: : Given r=2 and \\\\tfrac{dh}{dt}=0.03 , find \\\\tfrac{d}{dt}(\\\\pi r^2h). Word problems are a common way to train and test understanding of underlying concepts using a descriptive problem, instead of solely exercising algebraic manipulation or other mechanical skills. History and culture The modern notation that enables mathematical ideas to be expressed symbolically was developed in Europe from the sixteenth century onwards. Prior to this, all mathematical problems and solutions were written out in words; the more complicated the problem, the more laborious and convoluted the verbal explanation. Examples of word problems can be found dating back to Babylonian times. Apart from a few procedure texts for finding things like square roots, most Old Babylonian problems are couched in a language of measurement of everyday objects and activities. Students had to find lengths of canals dug, weights of stones, lengths of broken reeds, areas of fields, numbers of bricks used in a construction, and so on.Duncan J Melville (1999) Old Babylonian Mathematics http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/obsummary.html Ancient Egyptian mathematics also has examples of word problems. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus includes a problem that can be translated as: > There are seven houses; in each house there are seven cats; each cat kills > seven mice; each mouse has eaten seven grains of barley; each grain would > have produced seven hekat. What is the sum of all the enumerated > things?Egyptian Algebra - Mathematicians of the African Diaspora In more modern times the sometimes confusing and arbitrary nature of word problems has been the subject of satire. Gustave Flaubert wrote this nonsensical problem, now known as the Age of the captain: > Since you are now studying geometry and trigonometry, I will give you a > problem. A ship sails the ocean. It left Boston with a cargo of wool. It > grosses 200 tons. It is bound for Le Havre.

How old is the captain? Mathematical Quotations - F Word problems have also been satirised in The Simpsons, when a lengthy word problem (\\"An express train traveling 60 miles per hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, 520 miles away. At the same time, a local train traveling 30 miles an hour carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe...\\") trails off with a schoolboy character instead imagining that he is on the train.Andrew Nestler's Guide to Mathematics and Mathematicians on The Simpsons References  External links  * Word problems that lead to simple linear equations at cut-the-knot Mathematics education ","title":"Word problem (mathematics education)"},{"id":"297015","text":"Frank Heyling Furness (November 12, 1839 - June 27, 1912) was an American architect of the Victorian era. He designed more than 600 buildings, most in the Philadelphia area, and is remembered for his diverse, muscular, often unordinarily scaled buildings, and for his influence on the Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. Furness also received a Medal of Honor for bravery during the Civil War. Toward the end of his life, his bold style fell out of fashion, and many of his significant works were demolished in the 20th century. Among his most important surviving buildings are the University of Pennsylvania Library (now the Fisher Fine Arts Library), the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, all in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Biography Furness was born in Philadelphia on November 12, 1839. His father, William Henry Furness, was a prominent Unitarian minister and abolitionist, and his brother, Horace Howard Furness, became America's outstanding Shakespeare scholar. Frank, however, did not attend a university and apparently did not travel to Europe. He began his architectural training in the office of John Fraser, Philadelphia, in the 1850s. He attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts-inspired atelier of Richard Morris Hunt in New York from 1859 to 1861, and again in 1865, following his military service. Furness considered himself Hunt's apprentice and was influenced by Hunt's dynamic personality and accomplished, elegant buildings. He was also influenced by the architectural concepts of the French engineer Viollet-le-Duc and the British critic John Ruskin. Germantown Unitarian Church (1866‚Äì67, demolished ca. 1928). Furness's first commission, Germantown Unitarian Church (1866‚Äì67, demolished ca. 1928), was a solo effort, but in 1867, he formed a partnership with Fraser, his former teacher, and George Hewitt, who had worked in the office of John Notman. The trio lasted less than five years, and its major commissions were Rodef Shalom Synagogue (1868‚Äì69, demolished) and the Lutheran Church of the Holy Communion (1870‚Äì75, demolished). Following Fraser's move to Washington, D.C., to become supervising architect for the U.S. Treasury Department, the two younger men formed a partnership in 1871, and soon won the design competition for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871‚Äì76). Louis Sullivan worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness & Hewitt (June - November 1873), and his later use of organic decorative motifs can be traced, at least in part, to Furness. By the beginning of 1876, Furness had broken with Hewitt, and the firm carried only his name. Hewitt and his brother William formed their own firm, G.W. & W.D. Hewitt, and became Furness's biggest competitor. In 1881, Furness promoted his chief draftsman, Allen Evans, to partner (Furness & Evans); and, in 1886, did the same for four other long-time employees.James F. O'Gorman, George E. Thomas & Hyman Myers, The Architecture of Frank Furness (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), pp. 200-03. The firm continued under the name Furness, Evans & Company as late as 1932, two decades after its founder's death.Michael J. Lewis, Frank Furness: Architecture and the Violent Mind (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., Inc., 2001), p. 251. Furness was one of the most highly paid architects of his era, and a founder of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Over his 45-year career, he designed more than 600 buildings, including banks, office buildings, churches, and synagogues. Nearly one-third of his commissions came from railroad companies. As chief architect of the Reading Railroad, he designed about 130 stations and industrial buildings. For the Pennsylvania Railroad, he designed more than 20 structures, including the great Broad Street Station (demolished 1953) at Broad and Market Streets in Philadelphia. His 40 stations for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad included the ingenious 24th Street Station (demolished 1963) beside the Chestnut Street Bridge. His residential buildings included numerous mansions in Philadelphia and its suburbs (especially the Main Line), as well as commissioned houses at the New Jersey seashore; Newport, Rhode Island; Bar Harbor, Maine; Washington, D.C.; New York state; and Chicago, Illinois. Furness broke from dogmatic adherence to European trends, and juxtaposed styles and elements in a forceful manner. His strong architectural will is seen in the unorthodox way he combined materials: stone, iron, glass, terra cotta, and brick. And his straightforward use of these materials, often in innovative or technologically advanced ways, reflected Philadelphia's industrial-realist culture of the post‚ÄìCivil War period. Frank Furness tombstone in Laurel Hill Cemetery Furness married Fanny Fassit in 1866, and they had four children: Radclyffe, Theodore, James, and Annis Lee. He died on June 27, 1912, at \\"Idlewild,\\" his summer house outside Media, and is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Military service 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry Monument, Gettysburg Battlefield (1888). During the Civil War, Furness served as Captain and commander of Company F, 6th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry (\\"Rush's Lancers\\"). He received the Medal of Honor for his gallantry at the Battle of Trevilian Station. =Medal of Honor citation= Rank and organization: Captain, Company F, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry.

Of the hundreds of > monuments at Gettysburg, Furness's is among the most haunting.Lewis, p. 44. Rediscovery Following decades of neglect, during which many of Furness's most important buildings were demolished, there was a revival of interest in his work in the mid-20th century. The critic Lewis Mumford, tracing the creative forces that had influenced Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, wrote in The Brown Decades (1931): \\"Frank Furness was the designer of a bold, unabashed, ugly, and yet somehow healthily pregnant architecture.\\"Lewis Mumford, The Brown Decades: A Study of Arts in America 1865-1895 (New York: 1931), p. 144. The architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock, in his comprehensive survey Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (revised 1963), saw beauty in that ugliness: Architect and critic Robert Venturi in Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (1966) wrote, not unadmiringly, of the National Bank of the Republic (later the Philadelphia Clearing House): > The city street facade can provide a type of juxtaposed contradiction that > is essentially two-dimensional. Frank Furness' Clearing House, now > demolished like many of his best works in Philadelphia, contained an array > of violent pressures within a rigid frame. The half-segmental arch, blocked > by the submerged tower which, in turn, bisects the facade into a near > duality, and the violent adjacencies of rectangles, squares, lunettes, and > diagonals of contrasting sizes, compose a building seemingly held up by the > buildings next door: it is an almost insane short story of a castle on a > city street.Robert Venturi, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture > (New York: Museum of Modern Art Papers on Architecture, 1966), pp. 56-57. On the occasion of its centennial in 1969, the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects memorialized Furness as its 'great architect of the past': > For designing original and bold buildings free of the prevalent Victorian > academicism and imitation, buildings of such vigor that the flood of > classical traditionalism could not overwhelm them, or him, or his clients > ...

Mark-Lee Kirk's set designs for the 1942 Orson Welles film The Magnificent Ambersons seem to be based on Furness's ornate Neo-Grec interiors of the 1870s.Lewis, p. 108. A fictional desk designed by Furness is featured in the John Bellairs novel The Mansion in the Mist. Furness's independence and modernist Victorian-Gothic style inspired 20th-century architects Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi. Living in Philadelphia and teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, they often visited Furness's Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts ‚Äî built for the 1876 Centennial ‚Äî and his University of Pennsylvania Library. In 1973, the Philadelphia Museum of Art mounted the first retrospective of Furness's work, curated by James F. O'Gorman, George E. Thomas and Hyman Myers. Thomas, Jeffrey A. Cohen and Michael J. Lewis authored Frank Furness: The Complete Works (1991, revised 1996), with an introduction by Robert Venturi. Lewis wrote the first biography: Frank Furness: Architecture and the Violent Mind (2001). The 2012 centenary of Furness's death was observed with exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Athenaeum of Philadelphia, the Delaware Historical Society, the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, and elsewhere.Furness schedule of events On September 14, a Pennsylvania state historical marker was dedicated in front of Furness's boyhood home at 1426 Pine Street, Philadelphia (now Peirce College Alumni Hall).

J. Townsend, Functions of a Complex Variable, 1915, p. 300Michiel Hazewinkel, Encyclopedia of Mathematics, 1993, 9:236 In other words, a transcendental function \\"transcends\\" algebra in that it cannot be expressed in terms of a finite sequence of the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and root extraction.'Transcendental function' Encyclopedia Britannica Examples of transcendental functions include the exponential function, the logarithm, and the trigonometric functions. Definition Formally, an analytic function ∆í(z) of one real or complex variable z is transcendental if it is algebraically independent of that variable.M. Waldschmidt, Diophantine approximation on linear algebraic groups, Springer (2000). This can be extended to functions of several variables. History The transcendental functions sine and cosine were tabulated from physical measurements in antiquity, as evidenced in Greece (Hipparchus) and India (jya and koti-jya). In describing Ptolemy's table of chords, an equivalent to a table of sines, Olaf Pedersen wrote: A revolutionary understanding of these circular functions occurred in the 17th century and was explicated by Leonhard Euler in 1748 in his Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite. These ancient transcendental functions became known as continuous functions through quadrature of the rectangular hyperbola xy = 1 by Gr√©goire de Saint-Vincent in 1647, two millennia after Archimedes had produced The Quadrature of the Parabola. The area under the hyperbola was shown to have the scaling property of constant area for a constant ratio of bounds. The hyperbolic logarithm function so described was of limited service until 1748 when Leonhard Euler related it to functions where a constant is raised to a variable exponent, such as the exponential function where the constant base is e. By introducing these transcendental functions and noting the bijection property that implies an inverse function, some facility was provided for algebraic manipulations of the natural logarithm even if it is not an algebraic function. The exponential function is written \\\\exp (x) = e^x . Euler identified it with the infinite series \\\\sum_{k=0} ^{\\\\infty} x^k / k ! , where k! denotes the factorial of k. The even and odd terms of this series provide sums denoting cosh x and sinh x, so that e^x = \\\\cosh x + \\\\sinh x . These transcendental hyperbolic functions can be converted into circular functions sine and cosine by introducing (‚àí1)k into the series, resulting in alternating series. After Euler, mathematicians view the sine and cosine this way to relate the transcendence to logarithm and exponent functions, often through Euler's formula in complex number arithmetic. Examples The following functions are transcendental: :f_1(x) = x^\\\\pi \\\\ :f_2(x) = c^x :f_3(x) = x^{x} :f_4(x) = x^{\\\\frac{1}{x}} =\\\\sqrt[x]{x}\\\\ :f_5(x) = \\\\log_c x :f_6(x) = \\\\sin{x} In particular, for ∆í2 if we set c equal to e, the base of the natural logarithm, then we get that ex is a transcendental function. Similarly, if we set c equal to e in ∆í5, then we get that f_5(x) = \\\\log_e x = \\\\ln x (that is, the natural logarithm) is a transcendental function. Algebraic and transcendental functions The most familiar transcendental functions are the logarithm, the exponential (with any non-trivial base), the trigonometric, and the hyperbolic functions, and the inverses of all of these. Less familiar are the special functions of analysis, such as the gamma, elliptic, and zeta functions, all of which are transcendental. The generalized hypergeometric and Bessel functions are transcendental in general, but algebraic for some special parameter values. A function that is not transcendental is algebraic. Simple examples of algebraic functions are the rational functions and the square root function, but in general, algebraic functions cannot be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions.cf. Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem The indefinite integral of many algebraic functions is transcendental. For example, the logarithm function arose from the reciprocal function in an effort to find the area of a hyperbolic sector. Differential algebra examines how integration frequently creates functions that are algebraically independent of some class, such as when one takes polynomials with trigonometric functions as variables. Transcendentally transcendental functions Most familiar transcendental functions, including the special functions of mathematical physics, are solutions of algebraic differential equations. Those that are not, such as the gamma and the zeta functions, are called transcendentally transcendental or hypertranscendental functions. Exceptional set If f is an algebraic function and \\\\alpha is an algebraic number then f(\\\\alpha) is also an algebraic number. The converse is not true: there are entire transcendental functions f such that f(\\\\alpha) is an algebraic number for any algebraic \\\\alpha.A. J. van der Poorten. 'Transcendental entire functions mapping every algebraic number field into itself‚Äô, J. Austral. Math. Soc. 8 (1968), 192‚Äì198 For a given transcendental function the set of algebraic numbers giving algebraic results is called the exceptional set of that function.D. Marques, F. M. S. Lima, Some transcendental functions that yield transcendental values for every algebraic entry, (2010) .N. Archinard, Exceptional sets of hypergeometric series, Journal of Number Theory 101 Issue 2 (2003), pp.244-269. Formally it is defined by: :\\\\mathcal{E}(f)=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{Q}}\\\\,:\\\\,f(\\\\alpha)\\\\in\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{Q}} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. In many instances the exceptional set is fairly small. For example, \\\\mathcal{E}(\\\\exp)=\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, this was proved by Lindemann in 1882. In particular exp(1) = e is transcendental. Also, since exp(iœÄ) = ‚àí1 is algebraic we know that iœÄ cannot be algebraic. Since i is algebraic this implies that œÄ is a transcendental number. In general, finding the exceptional set of a function is a difficult problem, but if it can be calculated then it can often lead to results in transcendental number theory. Here are some other known exceptional sets: * Klein's j-invariant ::\\\\mathcal{E}(j)=\\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbf{H}\\\\,:\\\\,[\\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\alpha): \\\\mathbf{Q}]=2\\\\\\\\}, :where H is the upper half-plane, and [Q(Œ±): Q] is the degree of the number field Q(Œ±). This result is due to Theodor Schneider.T. Schneider, Arithmetische Untersuchungen elliptischer Integrale, Math. Annalen 113 (1937), pp.1-13. * Exponential function in base 2: ::\\\\mathcal{E}(2^x)=\\\\mathbf{Q}, :This result is a corollary of the Gelfond- Schneider theorem, which states that if \\\\alpha eq 0,1 is algebraic, and \\\\beta is algebraic and irrational then \\\\alpha^\\\\beta is transcendental. Thus the function 2x could be replaced by cx for any algebraic c not equal to 0 or 1. Indeed, we have: ::\\\\mathcal{E}(x^x)=\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left(x^{\\\\frac{1}{x}}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. *A consequence of Schanuel's conjecture in transcendental number theory would be that \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left(e^{e^x}\\\\right)=\\\\emptyset. *A function with empty exceptional set that does not require assuming Schanuel's conjecture is f(x) =\\\\exp(1+\\\\pi x). While calculating the exceptional set for a given function is not easy, it is known that given any subset of the algebraic numbers, say A, there is a transcendental function whose exceptional set is A.M. Waldschmidt, Auxiliary functions in transcendental number theory, The Ramanujan Journal 20 no 3, (2009), pp.341‚Äì373. The subset does not need to be proper, meaning that A can be the set of algebraic numbers. This directly implies that there exist transcendental functions that produce transcendental numbers only when given transcendental numbers. Alex Wilkie also proved that there exist transcendental functions for which first-order-logic proofs about their transcendence do not exist by providing an exemplary analytic function.A. Wilkie, An algebraically conservative, transcendental function, Paris VII preprints, number 66, 1998. Dimensional analysis In dimensional analysis, transcendental functions are notable because they make sense only when their argument is dimensionless (possibly after algebraic reduction). Because of this, transcendental functions can be an easy-to-spot source of dimensional errors. For example, log(5 meters) is a nonsensical expression, unlike log(5 meters / 3 meters) or log(3) meters. One could attempt to apply a logarithmic identity to get log(5) + log(meters), which highlights the problem: applying a non-algebraic operation to a dimension creates meaningless results.

In September of that year, Giuliano became an outlaw after shooting and killing a police officer who tried to arrest him for black-market food smuggling when 70% of Sicily's food supply was provided by the black market. He maintained a band of subordinates for most of his career. He was a flamboyant, high-profile criminal, attacking the police at least as often as they sought him. In addition, he was a local power-broker in Sicilian politics between 1945 and 1948, including his role as a nominal colonel for the Movement for the Independence of Sicily. He and his band were held legally responsible for the Portella della Ginestra massacre, though there is some doubt about their role in the numerous deaths which occurred. The widespread international press coverage he attracted made him an embarrassment to the Italian government, and throughout his banditry up to 2000 police and soldiers were deployed against him. He was murdered on 5 July 1950. The historian Eric Hobsbawm described him as the last of the \\"people's bandits\\" (√† la Robin Hood) and the first to be covered in real time by modern mass media.Hobsbawm, Robin Hoodo, p. 12 Biography =Early life= Giuliano was born on 16 November 1922, in Montelepre, a rural village in western Sicily, the fourth and youngest child of Salvatore Giuliano, Sr. and Maria Lombardo. His parents were landed peasants who had spent some of their earlier lives in the United States where they had earned the money to buy their farmland.Chandler, p 7 Turi or Turridu ‚Äì as he was known to distinguish him from his father ‚Äì attended primary school in the village from the age of 10 to 13. Although he was a good student,Maxwell, p.42 when his older brother Giuseppe was drafted into the Italian armed forces in 1935, he left school to help his father cultivate the family farm. He soon tired of the drudgery of farm work, hired a substitute from the village to take his place, and began trading in olive oil, which brought additional income to the family. Later in life he claimed that he quit school as much from youthful impulsiveness as from economic necessity. The outbreak of World War II brought him opportunities in the form of jobs installing road barriers and telephone infrastructure. He performed well, but was dismissed from both jobs after disputes with his bosses. At the time of the Allied Invasion of Sicily in July 1943, Giuliano was once again trading in olive oil. =Outlaw career= The most immediate trouble caused by the Allied invasion was the breakdown of government structures and the legal distribution of food. Especially in the cities, up to 70% of the food was supplied through the black market, including small-scale operators to large scale, well- financed and well-organized operations. With a horse brought home from the war by his brother and a Beretta handgun for protection, Giuliano was soon a participant in the black market.Chandler, pp. 5-7 The Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) used the remnants of the previous fascist government, especially the Polizia and Carabinieri, to suppress the black market. Since their pay was irregular and most of their income was bribes from major black marketeers, they focused their attention on minor operators. On 2 September 1943, Giuliano was caught at a Carabinieri check point transporting two sacks of black market grain. While trying to negotiate his release in return for surrendering the grain, Giuliano drew his gun when another black marketeer was apprehended. When one of the officers, Antonio Mancino, raised his weapon, Giuliano shot and killed him; he was the first carabiniere killed by the Mafia. Giuliano was shot in the back as he fled. After the escape and an operation arranged by his family, he hid out in the family home.Chandler, pp. 8-10 On Christmas Eve 1943, the Carabinieri moved into Montelepre to apprehend Giuliano. The operation included mass arrests‚Äîa dragnet. He escaped, but angered by the dragnet, he shot and killed another officer.Chandler, pp 10-11 Benefitting from his intimate knowledge of the surrounding mountainous terrain Giulano was able to evade the authorities, while visiting his family occasionally. On 30 January 1944, he helped the escape of eight fellow villagers from the jail in Monreale. Six of them joined him and formed a band that was able to expand operations.Chandler, pp. 10-11, 140 With no income and outside of the law, Giuliano turned to banditry, and later extortion and kidnapping. His exclusive target was the wealthy, partly from identification with poor peasants, but mostly for efficiency‚Äîthe rich had more money. Thanks to Sicily's omerta tradition, local peasants were reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement, and Giuliano made them his allies and effective co-conspirators. Throughout his career he paid up to ten times the going market rate for his supplies to the locals. They became good sources of intelligence about rich targets for his crimes, as well as law enforcement activity.Chandler, pp 15-16 While Giuliano's core band was never larger than 20 men,Chandler, p. 72 peasants from Montelepre and nearby Giardinello would join him in the mountains temporarily for the excellent pay the bandit offered. This pattern continued until the last few beleaguered months of his career.Chandler, p. 140 The bandit also won allegiance by enforcing rough justice in the area he came to dominate. On at least one occasion, he killed a rogue bandit committing crimes in his name.Chandler, p. 17 He shot Montelepre's postmaster for stealing parcels from America. Storekeeper Giuseppe Terranova was executed for extortionate prices and usury. He intervened with a local gabelotto, an estate manager, to lease land to farmers from Montelepre.Chandler, p. 21Murray, p. 24 If benevolence failed, Giuliano killed informers and enemies ruthlessly.Chandler, p. 14Chandler, pp. 64-65Chandler, pp. 142-43 Whenever possible they were allowed a minute to pray before death and a note of responsibility was left; to warn other spies, and to make sure that neither Giuliano nor other bandits would be accused of crimes they didn't commit.Chandlerpp14-15 From time to time, he and his men would attack Carabinieri and Polizia outposts and patrols, often killing lawmen. They killed 87 Carabinieri and 33 Polizia from 1943-49.Chandler, pp. 17, 166 Giuliano was admired for his bravery and resistance‚Äîbut even more because he routinely prevailed in contests of power‚Äîthe ultimate measure of worth in Sicilian culture, with its premium on individualism and settling one's own scores. The peasantry identified strongly with him and protected him.Chandler, pp.19-20 Newspaper reports.Giuliano e lo Stato: materiali sul primo intrigo della Repubblica The bandit's most famous exploit occurred early in his career in 1944‚Äîthe robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. He kissed her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore for the rest of his life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's ‚ÄúIn Dubious Battle‚Äù from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.Chandler, pp. 16, 20 =MIS, EVIS, kidnapping and extortion= In April 1945 venturing onto the larger stage of politics, Giuliano issued a public declaration of his support for MIS, the Movement for the Independence of Sicily (also referred to as Separatism).Chandler, p. 48 Separatism coalesced in the aftermath of the invasion, drawing on long-simmering anger at Sicily's neglect by the central government, and the sudden fluidity of the political situation. The movement was dealt a severe blow when, for political and war strategy reasons, the Allies, who had courted, if not encouraged separatist leaders, handed control of Sicily to the Badoglio government in Rome in February 1944. Strong sentiment for independence still existed in Sicily, but the three main Italian political parties of post-war Italy, Christian Democratic, Communist, and Socialist‚Äîwere all opposed to Sicilian independence. After a government enabled campaign of violent repression, the MIS decided to augment its political campaign with armed resistance.Chandler, pp. 24-32Finkelstein, p 178 Their small armed contingent, the EVIS, operated in Catania Province in eastern Sicily. To strengthen their forces and divert attention from their army, the leaders of MIS and EVIS enlisted Giuliano, who after negotiating for substantial funding, accepted the rank of Colonel, and agreed to conduct an armed campaign in his zone. He recruited 40-60 young men (in addition to his regular band), provided them with uniforms, ranks, and weapons, and trained them.Chandler, pp. 48-57 Among the recruits was Gaspare Pisciotta, nicknamed Aspanu. He and Turi would be virtually inseparable friends for the rest of Giuliano's life, and by the end of the MIS military campaign Pisciotta would become his second-in-command, also for the rest of the chieftain's life. Contrary to many reports, the Montelepre native was neither a cousin, nor a close childhood friend of Giuliano.Chandler, pp. 190-1 On 27 December 1945, Giuliano launched his insurrection with an attack on a Carabinieri outpost‚Äîtwo days before the MIS army was put out of existence at San Mauro. Their campaign, the most publicly spectacular of the bandit's career, created havoc for the police forces and government. Martial law was declared in Montelepre and the surrounding region on 13 January 1946, and continued for 126 days‚Äîat times incorporating army units. Giuliano's campaign was so effective that up to 500 police officers and soldiers were deployed against him. During the MIS campaign, the national Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Romita offered 800,000 lire for the capture of Giuliano‚Äîwho responded with a 2 million lire reward for the capture of Romita.Chandler, pp. 57-63 The chieftain and his men eventually realized the political hopelessness of their situation, and the revolt dissolved, as the new recruits went back to their ordinary lives. Giuliano helped at least 2 of his men to emigrate to the U.S.Chandler, pp. 64-5, 73-4 The EVIS campaign drew widespread news coverage, and made the bandit an international figure.Finkelstein, p. 181 After the revolt the MIS resumed its political campaign, which was plagued by poor organization. Through surrogates, Giuliano campaigned for the MIS in the towns where he was the major power. On 2 June 1946 Giardinello, Monreale, and Montelepre voted heavily for the Separatists, but island wide, they received only 9% of the vote.Chandler, pp. 65-8 For the rest of 1946 and until his death, Giuliano's main activity and source of revenue was kidnapping, often carried out by the squad of Antonio Terranova, the bandit's most formidable and resourceful operative. Giuliano and his men treated their captives well‚Äîalmost chivalrously‚Äîoften giving them favorite foods, reading to them to alleviate boredom, and providing necessary medicines. Negotiations were usually conducted through various mafiosi. More than one kidnap victim remembered time with Giuliano in a positive light, despite its hardships. Giuliano also used the threat of kidnapping to extort money from wealthy Sicilians‚Äîsome preferred kidnapping because the bandit stuck to his own rule that no one would be kidnapped twice, while the number of extortions had no limit.Chandler, pp. 75-81 =Portella della Ginestra= Giuliano's next foray into politics ended in disaster. In the 1947 Sicilian regional election, the MIS won 9% of the vote, but began a steady deterioration from which it never recovered. The winner of the election with 30% of the vote was the Popular Bloc, Communists-Socialists, against less than 20% for the Christian Democrats.Chandler, pp. 84-5 The island's conservatives and reactionaries were alarmed, and called on Giuliano for help. Their main aim was to intimidate the peasantry and thwart calls for land reform and redistribution. Although Giuliano identified with the peasantry and had progressive ideas for land reform close to left-wing doctrine, he was staunchly anti-Communist, based on stories of the U.S. he heard from his parents. This, and his practical desire for a pardon from Sicily's power brokers, inclined him to cooperate with the existing, predominantly right-wing power structure against the left.Chandler, pp86-7, 130-1 Giuliano may have been influenced by his interview early in 1947 with US pulp journalist Michael Stern. The American wore his WWII journalist sergeant's uniform to lend himself official credibility during his interview. Giuliano spoke to Stern as though the writer represented the US government, presenting a letter addressed to President Truman. The bandit emphasized his antipathy for Communism to Stern, who did nothing to discourage the bandit's mistaken notion that he was an official representative of the U.S. government. The interview led to a 5-page article in Life Magazine, (23 Feb 1948, pp. 60‚Äì4). Stern's subterfuge may have unwittingly influenced the bandit to cooperate with the Sicilian right.Chandler, pp. 86-90 The target of the right- wing vested interests was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A few days before the festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, ‚ÄúThe hour of our liberation has come. We are going to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.‚Äù One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian.Chandler, pp. 86, 90-1 According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily‚Äîany other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.Chandler, p. 94 Between 3000 and 5000 peasants attended. As the official proceedings began, three volleys of gunfire erupted from an ambush on adjoining Mount Pizzuta. Bullets from the third volley went into the crowds. The result was mass terror and many casualties‚Äî11 dead (including a woman and 3 children), and between 2 and 3 dozen wounded. Giuliano, the perpetrator of massed gunfire along with his band, left the scene quickly and surreptitiously, reportedly unaware of the massacre. When he learned what had transpired, he was distraught over the deaths and angry that his plans had gone awry.Chandler, pp. 92-94 The reaction throughout Italy was profound shock, followed by demands to punish the perpetrators. Initial suspicion fell on the Mafia and Sicily's large landowners. Characteristically, major Mafiosi in the area had alibis so good that Sicilians and others knowledgeable in their ways assumed that they had been arranged in advance. Some of their local chieftains had also given warnings to likely May Day celebrants before the event. There were reports of four armed local Mafiosi leaving the Portella area shortly after the massacre, but when Giuliano's involvement became known, investigation of the Mafia halted, and the bandits became the inquiry's focus. Giuliano and his men were isolated and a convenient target for officialdom, while the Mafia was well-connected politically and difficult to deal with.Chandler, pp. 92-8 Pisciotta and eleven other members of the Giuliano band were convicted for the massacre in 1952.Chandler, p 207 While alive, Giuliano himself made various, somewhat inconsistent statements about the matter, always insisting that the bloodshed was unintended. He threatened to reveal the names of the men behind his actions, but never did. During the trial for the massacre, Pisciotta named the main conspirators as Leone Marchesano, a Palermo Mafioso and politician, and Prince Giuseppe Aliata of Monreale, with politician Cusumano Geloso as their intermediary‚ÄîPisciotta met only Geloso. His claims were confirmed by a letter delivered in 1969 to Giuseppe Montalbano, a long time leftist opponent of the reactionary establishment of Sicily. The writer, Antonio Ramirez‚Äîa prominent Palermo politician‚Äîordered the letter delivered after his death. It stated that Gioacchino Barbera, a ranking Mafioso, had confirmed Pisciotta's accusations concerning Sicilian power-brokers, and also confirmed Giuliano's claim that the main conspirators did not intend the massacre. Barbera revealed all this to Ramirez during a December 1951 conversation. Billy Jaynes Chandler concludes that Sicily's reactionary establishment was the casus belli of the massacre, but that thanks to omerta and time, the details will never be revealed. A plaque erected by leftists in memory of the victims at Portella della Ginestra blames ‚Äúlanded barons and the Mafia.‚Äù*Chandler, pp. 100-5 :\\"On May 1, 1947, here, on the rock of Barbato, celebrating the working class festival and the victory of April 20, the people of Piana degli Albanesi, San Giuseppe Jato, and San Ciprirello, men, women and children, fell under the ferocious barbarity of the bullets of the Mafia and the landed barons, who mowed down innocent victims in order to put an end to the struggle of the peasants for liberation from the servitude of feudalism. The slaughter horrified the world. The blood of new martyrs consecrated in the conscience of the people the resolve to continue the struggle for the redemption of the land in a world of liberty and peace.\\" For the remainder of 1947, Giuliano maintained a low public profile while continuing his kidnap and ransom enterprise, occasionally engaging in ambushes and firefights with the law forces as opportunities presented themselves or to assert dominance in his area of operations. The killing of a Carabiniere colonel in October 1947 occasioned a brief incursion of 1000 law enforcers and mass arrests, but failed to capture Giuliano or any member of his band. In January 1948, Giuliano and Pisciotta felt secure enough to make an early evening appearance in a popular cafe' in the town of Carini. The event was covered well by the Sicilian press, which speculated that it followed a tryst in the same town.Chandler, pp. 123-9 =Final political campaign= After the Portella della Ginestra massacre, Giuliano's family was interrogated regularly and often incarcerated. (His house was under such surveillance that he could no longer visit.) Moved by their plight and desperate for some sort of pardon, the bandit once again answered the call of conservative politicians to work on their behalf in the 1948 elections.Chandler, pp. 129-30 In 1948 the parties of the Italian right and center were determined to undo the left's 1947 victory, and they were seeking every possible vote. The politicians couldn't afford to ignore the votes Giuliano controlled. Leone Marchesano, Santo Fleres, head of the Mafia and the Liberal Party in Partinico, and prominent Christian Democrat Bernardo Mattarella from the Mafia stronghold of Castellamare del Golfo all talked directly with Giuliano‚Äîwho would not campaign without promises from the highest level of Sicilian power brokers. He was guaranteed a full pardon if he delivered a large majority of the votes in his district. He delivered extravagant majorities for the center-right's victory on 18 April. The bandit waited for weeks after the election for word of his pardon‚Äîand he was finally informed that Minister of the Interior Mario Scelba, himself a Sicilian, had denied it, and advised that Giuliano and his men could emigrate to Brazil where Prince Aliata had vast estates and the bandits would be protected.Chandler, pp. 130-4 Giuliano, who had held up his end of a bargain, was outraged and promised retaliation. Shortly after seeing his mother and Mariannina for what would be the last time at a June picnic in the countryside,Chandler, pp. 139-41 the bandit learned that, besides the broken promise of a pardon, Santo Fleres' Mafia faction was informing law enforcement of Giuliano's movements. On 17 July 1948 two local Partinico bandits, hired by Giuliano, assassinated Fleres in that town's square. Thereafter, most of the Mafia organizations worked against Giuliano, effectively sealing his eventual fate.Chandler, pp.134-8 In the first action by any Mafiosi after Fleres' death, Giuliano opted out late from a law enforcement-Mafia fake escape to Tunisia by speedboat, probably forewarned by a still friendly Mafia faction or politician. Law enforcement also stepped up its own campaign against the bandit‚Äîfrom the middle of 1948 until Giuliano's death Montelepre was occupied in some state of siege by law enforcement, making the inhabitants' lives miserable. By the end of the year, all of his family was imprisoned.Chandler, pp. 141-9 Toward the end of 1948, a bit of relief arrived in the person of Maria Cyliakus, a Swedish dilettante journalist estranged from her Greek industrialist husband. Through audacity and luck she managed to visit, interview, and photograph Giuliano in the mountains, enhancing his notoriety throughout Europe, and giving Cyliakus her own burst of celebrity status.Chandler, pp. 150-55 =Bellolampo and final actions= Although Giuliano was under considerable duress by the beginning of 1949, he still had strengths to draw from. While his core band was diminished, men from the vicinity would still join him for the high wages he offered until the last months of 1949. His kidnapping and extortion rackets still produced sufficient income. For the first eight months of the year, he dominated the forces of law in his bailiwick‚Äîstaging numerous ambushes and occasionally attacking their headquarters. The publicity from Giuliano's continued mastery over the forces of law and order caused great consternation to Italy's Christian Democratic government, and in August Minister of the Interior Scelba dispatched Colonel Ugo Luca, commander of Carabinieri in Lazio, to 'observe' enforcement activity in Sicily, then overseen by Ciro Verdiani. Aged 58 and known as the ‚ÄúItalian Lawrence‚Äù Luca had a stellar military record, especially distinguished in intelligence work, and had been recommended to Scelba as a possible replacement for Verdiani. When Giuliano learned that Verdiani and Luca planned to visit the Bellolampo Carabinieri outpost between Palermo and Montelepre on 19 August, he prepared an ambush. After the two officials made a quick inspection, Giuliano and his men detonated a large explosion on the road under their convoy on its return to Palermo. Eight men were killed and over ten wounded. Had Luca and Verdiani returned in the vehicle they had ridden to Bellolampo, they would have been seriously wounded or killed. As a direct result, Verdiani was sent to Italy's Alpine region and Luca was dispatched to Sicily, along with 500 additional Carabinieri, to head up the campaign against Giuliano.Chandler, pp. 156-63, Servadio, pp128-9 =Colonel Ugo Luca= Luca would be Giuliano's last state opponent. His second-in-command was Captain Antonio Perenze, who had fought against guerillas in Libya and Ethiopia. After initial demonstrations of bravado in the field by the two leaders, Luca implemented his 'isolate and neutralize' strategy. He began by dividing the bandits' operational area into seventy zones, each to be patrolled by 20 men, who were given superior radio communications equipment demanded by Luca. Most of the men assumed civilian dress. They remained in the field, not retreating to safe stations and barracks each night. They were also ordered to cultivate good relations with the populace, eschewing pointless intimidation. Luca also sought to infiltrate the band or turn some of its members. Other officials had used similar tactics, but none were as thorough and relentless as the colonel.Chandler, pp. 167-68 Shortly after Luca's arrival, a meeting of major Mafiosi decreed that its members were to work with the colonel to eliminate the bandits. The Mafia men did not want a law officer of Luca's caliber on the island any longer than necessary. Mafiosi all over western Sicily received and forwarded information to the task force.Chandler, p. 169 Giuliano was isolated and his operations essentially crippled by October. None of his attacks on the Carabinieri or Polizia during Luca's command were successful. Only one of the 120 law officers killed by Giuliano and his band met his end during Luca's command. Individual arrests of bandits began in late September and on 13 October, most of Giuliano's key squad and its leader, Giuseppe Cucinella, were captured in a gun battle in Palermo. Cucinella and his men had been located and Luca informed by Mafiosi from Palermo.Chandler, pp. 169-71 Smaller scale arrests, following the same pattern took place throughout the colonel's campaign.Chandler, p. 180 Under duress in the territory he formerly dominated, Giuliano (and sometimes Pisciotta) surrendered most of his independence, and retreated to the protection of a Mafia branch in Castelvetrano, near the south coast, headed by Nicola 'The American' Piccione, repatriated from a successful career in the United States. The bandit's primary residence while in the Castelvetrano region was the home, in the heart of the city, of Gregorio de Maria, a childhood friend of Piccione's subordinate Giuseppe 'Pino' Marotta.Chandler, pp. 173-75, p.180 De Maria, an erudite and reclusive attorney, formed a bond with Giuliano as the bandit's intellectual mentor.Chandler, pp. 178-79 Although Ciro Verdiani had been replaced and dispatched, he maintained his contacts and continued to meddle in Sicily.Chandler, p.166 To spite Luca and their mutual superiors, in December 1949 he arranged for Jacopo Rizza of Oggi magazine to interview Giuliano and Pisciotta in the countryside near Salemi. The interview, published in successive issues of the weekly, caused a sensation and embarrassed the government.Chandler, pp. 171-73 Verdiani did much more, meeting with Giuliano near Castelvetrano, also in December. He agreed to help Giuliano and Pisciotta into exile, although his ultimate aim was almost certainly to kill the bandits and claim credit for the deed. The two men remained in contact until the last day of Giuliano's life, but in the end Verdiani's machinations failed.Chandler, pp. 175-77, 184-87, 192-93 =End of the career= In January 1950 a Sicilian carabiniere, Giovanni Lo Bianco, coerced Giuliano's treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, into betraying the bandit. Minasola set up band members to be captured by the authorities one at a time until April, when Giuliano had no more active operatives. Minasola was then able to persuade Aspanu Pisciotta to betray his closest friend‚ÄîPisciotta was an easy target, having long doubted Verdiani's plot to get himself and Giuliano out of the country.Chandler, pp. 181-84 On 19 June, Pisciotta met with Colonel Luca and agreed to work with him to eliminate Giuliano. After deliberation and intrigue among Luca's command, it was decided to kill Giuliano on the morning of 5 July in Castelvetrano. Pisciotta would lure Giuliano out to the street, and a squad of Carabinieri led by Captain Perenze would assassinate the bandit chieftain. Unfortunately for Luca, one of Verdiani's partisans was at the planning meeting, and Verdiani sent Giuliano a letter warning of Pisciotta's betrayal. When Aspanu arrived at the de Maria house after midnight on 5 July, Turi confronted him with Verdiani's communique‚Äîsomehow, Pisciotta convinced him that he was more trustworthy than the policeman but didn't dare to suggest they leave the house for the ambush. After both men laid down, ostensibly to sleep, Pisciotta waited until Giuliano was asleep. He then shot him twice killing him instantly. Aspanu ran outside, told a waiting Perenze what he'd done, and was spirited out of town. Perenze and his squad hauled Giuliano's corpse to a nearby courtyard, shot it with several rounds, and with Luca concocted a story of an informer, Giuliano's plan to flee the country by plane from Mazzara del Vallo, and the bandit's death in a running gun battle.Chandler, pp. 188-99 The next morning, Luca and Perenze repeated the story to the press in the courtyard, while visitors traipsed through to see Giuliano's body. Many observers, especially locals who'd heard rumors that didn't coincide with the official account, were skeptical of the official story. In the afternoon after the body had been moved to the local morgue, Maria Lombardo arrived. She fainted upon seeing the body, was revived, and identified her son. She insisted on kissing the bloodstains on the ground where he had lain in the courtyard.Chandler, pp. 195-96 Thanks to official wrangling, the body remained in Castelvetrano until 19 July (allowing hundreds of locals to view it in the interim). The burial in Montelepre that afternoon was private, on official orders to prevent publicity.Chandler, pp. 199-200 Cover of ‚ÄúL'Europeo‚Äù of July 1950 about the mysterious death of Giuliano The official story was unraveled by Tommaso Besozzi of the Milanese weekly L'Europeo. In the 16 and 24 July issues, he named Pisciotta as the murderer, but substituted misleading initials for Minasola. In spite of later official testimony by Pisciotta, de Maria, and Perenze confirming Besozzi's reportage, the concocted story remains as the official account.Chandler, pp. 197-99 Aspanu Pisciotta remained at large until 5 December when he emerged from a concealed space in his family's home and was arrested. He had been hiding there since shortly after Giuliano's murder, when the Carabinieri command, who couldn't grant the amnesty he sought, turned him loose.Chandler pp. 201-02 =Viterbo Trial= A trial, which officially concerned the massacre at Portella della Ginestra convened at Viterbo, Lazio on 12 June 1950, but was quickly adjourned and reconvened in 1951. It then spun into a wide examination of Giuliano's career. There were thirty six defendants, all with attorneys, many of whom wanted to expand the scope of the trial to embarrass the conservative government. All of the defendants except Pisciotta denied even being present at the May Day event. Pisciotta named many of the names previously cited, but also included Mario Scelba, Minister of the Interior. His revelations often occurred during barely coherent outburts‚Äîhis behavior indicated a man in the grip of fear and uncertainty. On 11 May 1951, he admitted murdering Giuliano.Chandler, pp. 202-03 A great deal of testimony, some the most dramatic of the proceedings, concerned a reputed diary that Giuliano kept, naming the powerful politicians with whom he collaborated. Pisciotta, Perenze, Luca, Marotta, and especially de Maria figured in its saga. De Maria was accused by a Mafioso, Stefano de Peri of telling him that he had destroyed the memoirs. None of the accused admitted to knowing what became of Giuliano's journal.Chandler, pp. 203-06 Testimony concluded late in 1951, and in May 1952 twelve defendants, including Terranova and Pisciotta, were sentenced for life; four were given shorter sentences, and the remainder were acquitted. More trials followed:Chandler, pp. 206-07 the last arrest of a Giuliano confederate on related charges was in 1964, and the last prisoner among them was released by 1980.Chandler, p. ix =Deaths of participants= On 10 February 1954, a few days after he talked to Pietro Scaglione, an assistant prosecutor from Palermo, Aspanu Pisciotta was assassinated by poison in his cell at Ucciardone Prison in Palermo while breakfasting with his cellmate father. The dose was a substantial 20 centigrams of strychnine, enough to kill 40 dogs. When Ciro Verdiani and Cusumano Geloso died before their natural life expectancies, suspicions of poisoning were voiced. Benedetto Minasola was murdered in 1960. The Mafioso suspected of poisoning Pisciotta was shot in 1961, and Scaglione was killed by the Mafia while serving as Prosecutor General of Palermo in 1971.Chandler, pp. 208-10 Historical context and interpretation Non-academic authors vary widely in their assessment of Giuliano. Michael Stern's first impression of the bandit was \\"Errol Flynn portraying Pancho Villa\\".Chandler, p 88 Gavin Maxwell pointed out that Giuliano was a romantic, hankering after justice from an early ageMaxwell pp 44-45‚Äîthe bandit's favorite author, Emilio Salgari, made a career from idealistic, romantic novels, and Giuliano was still reading them in his twenties living rough in the mountains.Chandler, p. 179 Gaia Servadio sees the bandit as a tool of the Mafia, whose notoriety and success were not the product of his personal qualities, but entirely a function of his mafioso protectors. She judges that he was easily eliminated once the protectors withdrew their support.Servadio, pp 122-130 For John Dickie, the ‚Äútruth‚Äù of Giuliano resides not in his character, but in the tangle of power and politics that enmeshed his life‚Äîcentered on the Mafia.Dickie, pp 209-210 Natalia Danesi Murray described Giuliano as a ‚Äútheatrical megalomaniac.‚ÄùMurray, p.23 The academics Monte Finkelstein and Eric Hobsbawm both emphasize Giuliano's historical role as an instrument of the existing power elite of Sicily. Finkelstein characterizes him as, \\"a tool of the landowners and conservatives... manipulated to slaughter innocent peasants in the name of halting Communism.\\" Hobsbawm notes ambiguity and naivete' in Giuliano's political role: Hobsbawm classifies Giuliano as a \\"social bandit\\",Hobsbawm, Bandits which he defines as ‚Äúpeasant outlaws whom the lord and state define as criminals, but who remain within peasant society, and are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation, and in any case men to be admired, helped and supported.‚ÄùHobsbawm, Bandits, p. 20 He further defines Giuliano as a member of the ‚Äúnoble robbers‚Äù subset of social bandits‚ÄîRobin Hood being the prototype.Hobsbawm, Bandits, p. 43 Central to Billy Jaynes Chandler's analysis is Giuliano's personality and psychology.Chandler, pp x-xi The bandit definitely saw himself as a romantic, heroic figure. He mused about his epitaph: ‚ÄúHere lies Giuliano, hero of Sicily.‚Äù He made photos of himself heroically astride a horse, labeled, ‚ÄúRobin Hood.‚ÄùChandler, p. 98 He cultivated his image carefully, with an eye on history.Chandler, p. 219Stern, (uncredited), p. 63 He was, according to Chandler, audacious (turning the tables on the Carabinieri Christmas Eve, 1943),Chandler, p 18 intelligentChandler, pp 178-79 and astute (when negotiating with EVIS and, later, with Sicily's power brokers). At the same time, he was unsophisticated and naive‚Äîan inexperienced village boy negotiating with far more worldly men when he played politics. Compounding his naivete' was his monumental ego and overly-grand self-conception.Chandler, p 139 Maria Lombardo shared his conception‚Äîshe told Michael Stern that the three outstanding personages of history were Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and her son, Turi.Chandler, p 87 Eric Hobsbawm agrees with Chandler's assessment of the bandit, emphasizing the role of the MIS leaders in persuading Giuliano see himself as a major political player.Hobsbawm, Robin Hoodo, pp. 15-16 In historical context, Chandler concurs with Hobsbawm's assessment of Giuliano as a \\"heroic robber\\".Chandler, p 216 Giuliano can also be interpreted through the prism of Samuel L. Popkin's rational peasant concept, according to Chandler. The bandit's acquisitive urge coincides well with the rational peasant model, and he and his mother engaged in mafia-like rational acquisitiveness by demanding a fee from a bakery attempting to open a branch in Montelepre. But his ‚Äúfoolhardy, impulsive‚Äù killing of a police officer in 1943 was the polar opposite of careful calculation.Chandler, p.220 The ordinary peasants who joined his armed actions in the moments of greatest need were more rational‚Äîwilling to take significant risks from time to time for a better payday than they would ordinarily earn in the difficult years after the war.Chandler, p.221 Mafiosi arising from the peasantry are even better examples of rationality: their entire lives are dedicated to material acquisition. Giuliano's dearest wish was to be pardoned for his crimes, and the only people who could possibly accommodate him were the power elite of Sicily (and Italy)Chandler, pp 130‚Äîand so he did business with them. As Chandler says, this made him ‚Äúabove all else, an outlaw who accommodated himself to the existing structure of power.‚ÄùChandler, p 218 Hobsbawm again agrees with Chandler‚Äîwith more emphasis on the politics and ideology of the situation.Hobsbawm, Robin Hoodo, p 16 Three residents of Montelepre during the years of Giuliano's banditry have added their commentary to the historical record. At a sparsely attended Separatist commemorative ceremony in 1980, his sister Mariannina gave her view of his character: ‚ÄúHe was good and honest. Turridu did what he did only from fear and out of poverty.‚ÄùChandler, p223 Padre diBella, Montelepre's parish priest, summed up the tumult of the bandit's life, and its effect on the village: ‚ÄúAnd all this for a few bags of flour!‚ÄùMurray, p. 27 In spite of the hardship and misery experienced by the villagers during Giuliano's banditry, one of them‚ÄîSaverio‚Äîremarked to Tomaso Besozzi, ‚ÄúWhat times those were, eh? When Giuliano was king of the mountain, and made the world tremble.‚ÄùChandler, p224 Doubts about Giuliano‚Äôs death Over the years doubts about Giuliano‚Äôs death have been expressed. According to some Giuliano fled from Sicily to Tunis and went on to live in the United States. The historian Giuseppe Casarrubea, son of one of the victims of Giuliano, compiled material to demonstrate that the body buried as Giuliano belonged to someone else. On October 15, 2010, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Palermo decided to exhume the body and compare its DNA with living relatives of Giuliano. \\"L√¨ dentro non c'√® il bandito Giuliano\\", La Repubblica, October 15, 2010Sicilian bandit Giuliano's body exhumed, La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, October 28, 2010 The DNA tests showed a 90% likelihood that the skeleton belongs to Giuliano.

A cascading failure is a process in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts can trigger the failure of other parts and so on. Such a failure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission, computer networking, finance, transportation systems, organisms, the human body, and ecosystems. Cascading failures may occur when one part of the system fails. When this happens, other parts must then compensate for the failed component. This in turn overloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes to fail one after another.  In power transmission  Cascading failure is common in power grids when one of the elements fails (completely or partially) and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system. Those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements. Cascading failure is a common effect seen in high voltage systems, where a single point of failure (SPF) on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system. This surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure, setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time. This failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and/or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load. For example, under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer. Monitoring the operation of a system, in real-time, and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade. Another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures, to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure, and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures. One of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload, i.e. since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed, it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element. The question if power grid failures are correlated have been studied in Daqing Li et al. as well as by Paul DH Hines et al. = Examples = Cascading failure caused the following power outages: * Blackout in Northeast America in 1965 * Blackout in Southern Brazil in 1999 * Blackout in Northeast America in 2003 * Blackout in Italy in 2003 * Blackout in London in 2003 * European Blackout in 2006 * Blackout in Northern India in 2012 * Blackout in South Australia in 2016 * Blackout in southeast South America in 2019  In computer networks  Cascading failures can also occur in computer networks (such as the Internet) in which network traffic is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software. In this context, the cascading failure is known by the term cascade failure. A cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems. The cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single, crucial router or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is routed to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation. = Symptoms = The symptoms of a cascade failure include: packet loss and high network latency, not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to congestion collapse, which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication. If enough routes go down because of a cascade failure, a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes. A common occurrence during a cascade failure is a walking failure, where sections go down, causing the next section to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This ripple can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored. = History = Cascade failures are a relatively recent development, with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks. The term was first applied in this context in the late 1990s by a Dutch IT professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large-scale failure. = Example = Network failures typically start when a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped. Systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more hops and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered. This can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down, creating similar problems of their own. Also, related systems are affected in this case. As an example, DNS resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another cascade failure all on its own. In December 2012, a partial loss (40%) of Gmail service occurred globally, for 18 minutes. This loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic‚Äîin this case, the error was caused by logic using an inappropriate all instead of the more appropriate some. The cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time.  Cascading structural failure  Certain load-bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the \\"zipper effect\\", where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members. In the case of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse, a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a zipper). A bridge that can have such a failure is called fracture critical, and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate factor of safety and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.  Other examples  = Biology = Biochemical cascades exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications. One negative example is ischemic cascade, in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released. Current research is to find a way to block this cascade in stroke patients to minimize the damage. In the study of extinction, sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen. Such a species is known as a keystone species. = Electronics = Another example is the Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator, which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed diode can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second. Yet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the implosion in 2001 of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction. = Finance = In finance, the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as systemic risk: the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions (its counterparties) to fail, cascading throughout the system. Institutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either \\"too big to fail\\" (TBTF) or \\"too interconnected to fail\\" (TICTF), depending on why they appear to pose a threat. Note however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se, but due to the interconnections. For detailed models in economics and finance, see Elliott et al. (2014) and Acemoglu et al. (2015). A related (though distinct) type of cascading failure in finance occurs in the stock market, exemplified by the 2010 Flash Crash. For a useful framework to study and predict the effect of cascading failures in finance see. A framework based on network theory and cascading failures that provides useful tools for policy makers and for testing macroprudential dynamical stress has been developed.  Interdependent cascading failures  Fig. 1: Illustration of the interdependent relationship among different infrastructures Fig. 2. Schematic demonstration of first- and second-order percolation transitions. In the second-order case, the giant component is continuously approaching zero at the percolation threshold p = p_c. In the first-order case, the giant component approaches zero discontinuously Diverse infrastructures such as water supply, transportation, fuel and power stations are coupled together and depend on each other for functioning, see Fig. 1. Owing to this coupling, interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failures, and in particular to targeted attacks, such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes in one network can trigger an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks. Electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks, and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large-scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. For example, the 2003 Italy blackout resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network, health care systems, and financial services and, in addition, severely influenced the telecommunication networks. The partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the electrical grid management system, thus producing a positive feedback on the power grid. This example emphasizes how inter-dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system. A framework to study the cascading failures between coupled networks based on percolation theory was developed recently. The cascading failures can lead to abrupt collapse compare to percolation in a single network where the breakdown of the network is continuous, see Fig. 2. Cascading failures in spatially embedded systems have been shown to lead to extreme vulnerability. For the dynamic process of cascading failures see ref. A model for repairing failures in order to avoid cascading failures was developed by Di Muro et al. Furthermore, it was shown that such interdependent systems when embedded in space are extremely vulnerable to localized attacks or failures. Above a critical radius of damage, the failure may spread to the entire system. Cascading failures spreading of localized attacks on spatial multiplex networks with a community structure has been studied by Vaknin et al. Universal features of cascading failures in interdependent networks have been reported Duan et al. A method for mitigating cascading failures in networks using localized information has been developed by Smolyak et al. For a comprehensive review on cascading failures in complex networks see Valdez et al.  Model for overload cascading failures  A model for cascading failures due to overload propagation is the Motter‚ÄìLai model. The tempo-spatial propagation of such failures have been studied by Jichang Zhao et al.

He is best known for the 1964 film Woman in the Dunes. He is also known for directing other titles such as The Face of Another (1966), Natsu No Heitai (Summer Soldiers, 1972), and Pitfall (1962) which was Teshigahara's directorial debut. He has been called \\"one of the most acclaimed Japanese directors of all time\\". Teshigahara is the first person of Asian descent to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, accomplishing this in 1964 for his work on Woman in the Dunes. Apart from being a filmmaker, Teshigahara also practiced other arts, such as calligraphy, pottery, painting, opera and ikebana.  Biography  Teshigahara was born in Tokyo, the son of S≈çfu Teshigahara, founder and grand master of the S≈çgetsu-ry≈´ school of ikebana. He graduated in 1950 from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and began working in documentary film. He directed his first feature film, Pitfall (1962), in collaboration with author K≈çb≈ç Abe and musician Toru Takemitsu. The film won the NHK New Director's award, and throughout the 1960s, he continued to collaborate on films with Abe and Takemitsu while simultaneously pursuing his interest in ikebana and sculpture on a professional level. In 1965, the Teshigahara/Abe film Woman in the Dunes (1964) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the original director's cut of Woman in the Dunes was 147 minutes, he cut it down to 124 minutes when he was invited to the Cannes Film Festival.http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/teshigahara/ In 1972, he worked with Japanese researcher and translator John Nathan to make Summer Soldiers, a film set during the Vietnam War about American deserters living on the fringe of Japanese society. From the mid-1970s onwards, he worked less frequently on feature films as he concentrated more on documentaries, exhibitions and the Sogetsu School and became grand master of the school in 1980. In 1980, after the death of his father, Teshigahara became the third generation Iemoto of Sogetsy School, using bamboo at his large-scale solo exhibitions at several well known museums, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Seoul, Korea (1989), Palazzo Reale in Milan, Italy (1995), and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. (1996). In Japan, Teshigahara displayed his art installations nationwide, including GEN-ICHIRO INOKUMA Museum of Contemporary Art in Marugame and Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. In the 1990s, he pushed the art form of renka, which is a series of impromptu Ikebana arranged by multiple artists. Throughout his career, Teshigahara also involved himself in stage and art direction, both domestically and internationally. He has directed performances such as the opera Turandot (Lyon, France, 1992; Geneva, Switzerland, 1996), and original Noh play Susanoh (the Avignon Theatre Festival, 1994), Sloka by Chandralekha Dance Company (1999), and original outdoor dance play Susano Iden (1991).https://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/about/iemoto/hiroshi/ On top of filmmaking, Ikebana, stage direction, and art direction, Teshigahara was also involved in ceramic art and calligraphy. Throughout his life and career, Teshigahara expressed his artistic talents in various fields or art both domestically and internationally. Teshigahara died at the age of 74 on April 14, 2001, in his hometown, Tokyo, Japan. On the first anniversary of his death, April 14, 2002, a DVD box set containing his best known work was released in Japan in commemoration.

The party was founded by a journalist, L√©on DegrelleThe rexist movement in Belgium, PhD thesis Martin Conway, 1989, University of Oxford, and, unlike other fascist parties in the Belgium of the time, advocated Belgian unitarism and royalism. Initially the party ran in both Flanders and Wallonia, but it never achieved much success outside Wallonia and Brussels. Its name was derived from the Roman Catholic journal and publishing company Christus Rex (Latin for Christ the King). The highest electoral achievement of the Rexist Party was its gaining of 21 out of 202 deputies (with 11.4% of the vote) and twelve senators in the 1936 election.Richard Bonney Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936‚Äì1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; pp. 175‚Äì176 Never a mass movement, it was on the decline by 1938. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, Rex was the largest collaborationist group in French- speaking Belgium, paralleled by the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders. By the end of the war Rex was widely discredited, and was banned following the liberation. Initially modelled on Italian Fascism and Spanish Falangism, it later drew closer to German Nazism. The Party espoused a \\"right- wing revolution\\" and the dominance of the Catholic Church in Belgium, but its ideology came to be vigorously opposed by the leader of the Belgian Church Cardinal van Roey, who called Rexism a \\"danger to the church and to the country\\". Ideology The ideology of Rex, which was loosely based on the writings of Jean Denis, called for the \\"moral renewal\\" of Belgian society through dominance of the Catholic Church, by forming a corporatist society and abolishing liberal democracy. Denis became an enthusiastic member of Rex, and later wrote for the party newspaper Le Pays R√©el. The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from Charles Maurras' integralism. It rejected liberalism, which it deemed decadent, and was strongly opposed to both Marxism and capitalism, instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional family values. In its early period ‚Äî until around 1937 ‚Äî Rexism cannot accurately be categorised as a fascist movement. Rather it was a populist, authoritarian and conservative Catholic nationalist movement that initially tried to win power by democratic means, and did not want to totally abolish democratic institutions. The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but only after Degrelle's own defeat in a by- election in April 1937 did it openly embrace anti-Semitism and anti- parliamentarism, following the model of German Nazism. Historian and expert on fascism Roger Griffin only considers the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as \\"fully fascist\\"; until then he considers it \\"proto- fascist\\". The Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936, party leader L√©on Degrelle made a secret agreement with Rex's Flemish counterpart, the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV; \\"Flemish National Union\\") led by Staf De Clercq.Geheim akkoord tussen Rex en VNV quoted in Both movements strove for a corporatist system, but unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the Netherlands. The Flemish side cancelled the agreement after just one year. It also faced competition from the ideologically similar (but explicitly anti- German) L√©gion Nationale (\\"National Legion\\") of Paul Hoornaert. Pre-war politics L√©on Degrelle, leader of Rex, pictured at a pre-war rally The Rexist Party was founded in 1935 after its leader L√©on Degrelle had left the mainstream Catholic Party which he deemed too moderate. It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the Depression era, it initially won considerable popularity ‚Äî mostly due to its leader's charisma and energy. Its greatest success was when it won 11.5 per cent of the total vote in the 1936 election. On that occasion the Rexist Party took 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 8 out of 101 in the Senate, making it the fourth- strongest force in Parliament, behind the major established parties (Labour, Catholic, Liberal). However, the support for the party (even at its height) was extremely localized: Rexists succeeded in garnering over 30 per cent of the vote in the French-speaking province of Luxembourg, compared with just 9 per cent in equally French-speaking Hainaut. Degrelle admired Adolf Hitler's rise to power and progressively imitated the tone and style of fascist campaigning, while the movement's ties to the Roman Catholic Church were increasingly repudiated by the Belgian clergy. Rexism received subsidies from both Hitler and Mussolini. Degrelle ran in the April 1937 Brussels by-election against Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland of the Catholic Party, who was supported ‚Äî in the hope of thwarting a Rexist victory ‚Äî by all other parties, including even the Communists. The Archbishop of Mechelen and primate of the Catholic Church of Belgium, Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey, intervened, rebuking Rexist voters, insisting that even abstention from voting would be sinful, and calling Rexism \\"a danger to the country and to the Church\\". Degrelle was decisively defeated: he obtained only 20 per cent of the vote, the rest going to Van Zeeland.Richard Bonney Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936‚Äì1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; pp. 174‚Äì175. Afterwards, Rexism allied itself with the interests of Nazi Germany even more strongly and incorporated Nazi-style antisemitism into its platform. At the same time, its popularity declined sharply. In the 1939 national election, Rex's share of votes fell to 4.4 per cent, and the party lost 17 of its 21 seats, largely to the mainstream Catholic and Liberal parties. Second World War With the German invasion of Belgium in 1940, Rexism welcomed German occupation, even though it had initially supported the pre-war Belgian policy of neutrality. While some former Rexists went into the underground resistance or (like Jos√© Streel) withdrew from politics after they had come to see the Nazis' anticlerical and extreme anti-Semitic policies enforced in occupied Belgium, most Rexists, however, proudly supported the occupiers and assisted German forces with the repression of the territory wherever they could. Nevertheless, the popularity of Rex continued to drop. In 1941, at a reunion in Li√®ge, Degrelle was booed by about a hundred demonstrators. In August 1944, Rexist militia were responsible for the Courcelles Massacre. =Collaboration= Closely affiliated with Rex was the Walloon Legion, a unit within the German Army (Wehrmacht) and later the Waffen-SS raised from French-speaking volunteers in Belgium with Rexist support after German invasion of the Soviet Union. After an initial failure to attract recruits, Degrelle volunteered for the unit as a publicity stunt and spent much of the rest of the war outside Belgium on the Eastern Front. He increasingly saw the Walloon Legion as a better vehicle for seeking German support than the Rexist Party, and recruitment drained the party of its cadres. Whilst Degrelle was absent, nominal leadership of the party passed to Victor Matthys. End of Rexism From the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the party had been banned. With the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, many former Rexists were imprisoned or executed for their role during collaboration. Victor Matthys and Jos√© Streel were both executed by firing squad, Jean Denis (who had played only a minor role during the war) was imprisoned. Degrelle took refuge in Francoist Spain. He was convicted of treason in absentia in Belgium and sentenced to death, but repeated requests to extradite him were turned down by the Spanish government. Stripped of his citizenship and excommunicated (later lifted in Germany), Degrelle died in M√°laga in 1994. Election results { class=wikitable - !

Their members wore dark blue uniforms with the red Burgundian cross. Due to the constant depletion of its strength through members volunteering for more active forms of service in the German forces, the Formations had, by the end of 1943, virtually ceased to function.

They are also used for in-home fermentation of beverages, often beer or wine.  History and etymology  The word carboy is from the Persian qarƒÅbah (ŸÇÿ±ÿßÿ®Ÿá), from Middle Persian KarƒÅvah.Farahvashi, BahrƒÅm: Farhang-e FƒÅrsi be Pahlavi. Tehran University 1381 Shamsi. Arabic also borrowed it as qarrƒÅba, meaning \\"big jug\\".Hull Museums Collection hullcc.gov.uk Demijohn originally referred to any glass vessel with a large body and small neck, enclosed in wickerwork. The word presumably comes from the French dame-jeanne, literally \\"Lady Jane\\", as a popular appellation; this word is first attested in France in the 17th century.Oxford English Dictionary An alternative etymology derives it from the name of a Persian town, Damghan, but there is no evidence for this. Size Carboys come in various volumes ranging from . The term carboy itself usually refers to a carboy, unless otherwise noted. A carboy is sometimes called a jug. A carboy is usually called a demijohn (in the Philippines, dama juanaOcampo, Ambeth R. (August 9, 2006) Philippine Daily Inquirer \\"Tanduay\\". p. 13.). In Britain, \\"demijohn\\" refers to a 4.5 litre (imperial gallon) glass brewing vessel. Brewing In brewing, a carboy or demijohn is a glass or plastic vessel used in fermenting beverages such as wine, mead, cider, perry, and beer. Usually it is fitted with a rubber stopper and a fermentation lock to prevent bacteria and oxygen from entering during the fermentation process. During the homebrewing process, a primary carboy is used for fermentation. Once primary fermentation is complete, the beer is either transferred to a secondary carboy for conditioning or it can be transferred directly to bottles for conditioning. (This process of transferring is usually called racking.) Polypropylene carboys are also commonly used in laboratories to transfer purified water. They are typically filled at the top and have a spigot at the bottom for dispensing. Laboratory In modern laboratories, carboys are usually made of plastic, though traditionally were (and still are in many university settings) made of ferric glass or other shatter-resistant glasses immune to acid corrosion or halide staining common in older plastic formulations. They are used to store large quantities of liquids, such as solvents or deionised water. In these applications, a tap may be included for dispensing. Carboys are also used to collect and store waste solvents. Collecting waste solvents in plastic carboys is preferable to reusing glass Winchesters due to the lesser chance of breakage if a solution is placed in an incorrectly labeled carboy.

The nave () is the central part of a church, stretching from the (normally western) main entrance or rear wall, to the transepts, or in a church without transepts, to the chancel. When a church contains side aisles, as in a basilica-type building, the strict definition of the term \\"nave\\" is restricted to the central aisle. In a broader, more colloquial sense, the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers, including the side-aisles and transepts.Cram, Ralph Adams. Nave. The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. Accessed 13 July 2018 Either way, the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy. Description The nave extends from the entry‚Äîwhich may have a separate vestibule (the narthex)‚Äîto the chancel and may be flanked by lower side-aisles separated from the nave by an arcade. If the aisles are high and of a width comparable to the central nave, the structure is sometimes said to have three naves. It provides the central approach to the high altar. Etymology The term nave is from navis, the Latin word for ship, an early Christian symbol of the Church as a whole, with a possible connection to the \\"Ship of St. Peter\\" or the Ark of Noah. The term may also have been suggested by the keel shape of the vaulting of a church. In many Scandinavian and Baltic countries a model ship is commonly found hanging in the nave of a church, and in some languages the same word means both 'nave' and 'ship', as for instance Danish skib, Swedish skepp or Spanish (nave). History A fresco showing Old St Peter's Basilica, built in the 4th century: the central area, illuminated by high windows, is flanked by aisles. Late Gothic fan vaulting (1608, restored 1860s) over the nave at Bath Abbey, Bath, England. Suppression of the triforium offers a greater expanse of clerestory windows. The earliest churches were built when builders were familiar with the form of the Roman basilica, a public building for business transactions. It had a wide central area, with aisles separated by columns, and with windows near the ceiling. Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is an early church which had this form. It was built in the 4th century on the orders of Roman emperor Constantine I, and replaced in the 16th century. The nave, the main body of the building, is the section set apart for the laity, while the chancel is reserved for the clergy. In medieval churches the nave was separated from the chancel by the rood screen; these, being elaborately decorated, were notable features in European churches from the 14th to the mid-16th century. Medieval naves were divided into bays, the repetition of form giving an effect of great length; and the vertical element of the nave was emphasized. During the Renaissance, in place of dramatic effects there were more balanced proportions.

It is native to Africa, mainly south of the Sahara, and has been widely introduced into the West Indies, Brazil, Australia and Europe (e.g. southern France). Taxonomy The likely extinct subspecies N. m. sabyi of Morocco In the early days of the European colonisation of North America, the native wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) was confused with this species. The word meleagris, Greek for guineafowl, is also shared in the scientific names of the two species, though for the guineafowl it is the species name, whereas for the turkey, it is the name of the genus and (in inflected form) the family. =Subspecies= There are nine recognised subspecies: * N. m. coronata (Gurney, 1868) ‚Äì Gurney's helmeted guineafowl ‚Äì Type locality restricted to Uitenhage.

They weigh about . The body plumage is gray- black spangled with white. Like other guineafowl, this species has an unfeathered head. In this species it is decorated with a dull yellow or reddish bony knob, and bare skin with red, blue or black hues. The wings are short and rounded, and the tail is likewise short. Various sub-species are proposed, differences in appearance being mostly a large variation in shape, size and colour of the casque and facial wattles. Behaviour and ecology This is a gregarious species, forming flocks outside the breeding season typically of about 25 birds that also roost communally. Guineafowl are particularly well-suited to consuming massive quantities of ticks, which might otherwise spread lyme disease. These birds are terrestrial, and prone to run rather than fly when alarmed. Like most gallinaceous birds, they have a short- lived explosive flight and rely on gliding to cover extended distances. Helmeted guineafowl can walk 10 km and more in a day. Their bodies are well- suited for running and they are remarkably successful in maintaining dynamic stability over rough terrain at speed. They make loud harsh calls when disturbed. Their diet consists of a variety of animal and plant food. During the non-breeding season, N. meleagris consume corns, tubers, and seeds, particularly of agricultural weeds, as well as various agricultural crop spillage. During the breeding season, more than 80% of their diet may be invertebrates, particularly arthropods like beetles. Guineafowl are equipped with strong claws and scratch in loose soil for food much like domestic chickens, although they seldom uproot growing plants in so doing. As with all of the Numididae, they have no spurs. They may live for up to 12 years in the wild. Males often show aggression towards each other, and will partake in aggressive fighting which may leave other males bloodied and otherwise injured. They will attempt to make themselves look more fearsome by raising their wings upwards from their sides and bristling their feathers across the length of the body, and they may also rush towards their opponent with a gaping beak. The nest is a well-hidden, generally unlined scrape and a clutch is normally some 6 to 12 eggs which the female incubates for 26 to 28 days. Nests containing larger numbers of eggs are generally believed to be the result of more than one hen using the nest; eggs are large and an incubating bird could not realistically cover significantly more than a normal clutch. Domestic birds at least, are notable for producing very thick-shelled eggs that are reduced to fragments as the young birds (known as keets among bird breeders) hatch, rather than leaving two large sections and small chips where the keet has removed the end of the egg. It has been noted that domesticated guineafowl hens are not the best of mothers, and will often abandon their nests. The keets are cryptically coloured and rapid wing growth enables them to flutter onto low branches barely a week after hatching. Reproduction Helmeted guinea fowl are seasonally breeders. Summer is the peak breeding season in which the testes could weigh up to 1.6 gm, while during winter no breeding activity takes place. The serum testosterone level is up to 5.37 ng/ ml during the breeding season.Ali MZ, AS Qureshi, S Rehan, SZ Akbar and A Manzoor, 2015. Seasonal variations in histomorphology of testes and bursa, immune parameters and serum testosterone concentration in male guinea fowl (Numida meleagris). Pakistan Veterinary Journal, 35(1): 88‚Äì92 Habitat Head of an adult in South Africa. They breed in warm, fairly dry and open habitats with scattered shrubs and trees such as savanna or farmland. Suburban flocks Flocks of guineafowl have flourished in recent years in the northern and southern suburbs of Cape Town, where they have adapted remarkably well. Flocks wander slowly along the quieter suburban roads while foraging on the grassy 'pavements' and in gardens where the fence is low enough for some to enter without feeling separated from their flock. At night they often roost on the roofs of bungalows. While residents generally appreciate the local wildlife, they can be a nuisance, obstructing traffic and making a lot of noise in the early morning during the mating season. Their success may be attributed to their large but cautious flocks ‚Äì they can fend off cats, but don't enter gardens with dogs, and are visible enough in the quiet roads which they frequent to avoid being run over. Although many young guineafowl fall down drains (and are left behind by the flock), such casualties are not enough to restrain their numbers. Adult birds are sometimes caught and eaten by homeless people. Domestication Race N. m. subsp. galeatus, here seen wild in Niger, is popularly kept as free-ranging poultry. Helmeted guineafowl are often domesticated, and it is this species that is sold in Western supermarkets.

Aisles can be seen in airplanes, certain types of buildings, such as churches, cathedrals, synagogues, meeting halls, parliaments and legislatures, courtrooms, theatres, and in certain types of passenger vehicles. Their floors may be flat or, as in theatres, stepped upwards from a stage. Aisles can also be seen in shops, warehouses, and factories, where rather than seats, they have shelving to either side. In warehouses and factories, aisles may consist of storage pallets, and in factories, aisles may separate work areas. In health clubs, exercise equipment is normally arranged in aisles. Aisles are distinguished from corridors, hallways, walkways, footpaths/pavements (American English sidewalks), trails, paths and (enclosed) \\"open areas\\".

Aisles are also common in weddings when a bride walk down it. Architecture In architecture, an aisle is more specifically the wing of a house, or a lateral division of a large building. The earliest examples of aisles date back to the Roman times and can be found in the Basilica Ulpia (basilica of Trajan), which had double aisles on either side of its central area. The church of St. Peter's in Rome has the same number. Church architecture Image:aisle.bath.abbey.arp.jpgAn aisle in Bath Abbey, Bath, England. The aisle is lined with wooden seating (pews), the nave seating can be seen on the right, beyond the arcade pillars. The roof of the aisle is fan-vaulted. File:Seitenschiff.svgThe nave-aisles in this plan view of a cathedral are shaded pink; the arcade pillars are black dots File:Arcade diagram.png Interior elevation view of a Gothic cathedral, looking from the nave, with nave-aisle arcade highlighted. In church architecture, an aisle (also known as an yle or alley) is more specifically a passageway to either side of the nave that is separated from the nave by colonnades or arcades, a row of pillars or columns. Occasionally aisles stop at the transepts, but often aisles can be continued around the apse. Aisles are thus categorized as nave-aisles, transept-aisles or choir-aisles. A semi-circular choir with aisles continued around it, providing access to a series of chapels, is a chevet. In Gothic architecture, the aisles' roofs are lower than that of the nave, allowing light to enter through clerestory windows. In Romanesque architecture, however, the roofs are at roughly equal heights, with those of the aisle being only slightly lower than that of the nave. In Germany, churches where the roofs of the aisles and nave are the same height, such as St. Stephen's, Vienna, the Wiesenkirche at Soest, St. Martin's, Landshut, and the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in Munich are known as Hallenkirchen. When discussing overall design, architectural historians include the centrally-positioned nave in the number of aisles. Thus the original St Peter's Basilica in Rome, Milan Cathedral, Amiens Cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris and Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofiahttp://www.sofia- code.org/en/543/–∫–∞—Ç–µ–¥—Ä–∞–ª–∞-—Å–≤-–∞–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä-–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏/ are all described as having five aisles, meaning they have two side aisles either side of the nave. Antwerp Cathedral even has seven aisles (three at either side of the central nave). In the United Kingdom, cathedrals generally only have one aisle on each side, with Chichester Cathedral, Elgin Cathedral and St Mary Magdalene, Taunton being the only three exceptions. Supermarkets and retail stores A pet food and cleaning aisle of a supermarket. Supermarket checkout aisles In supermarkets there are two types of aisles, food aisles and checkout aisles. Food aisles are where goods are displayed. At the end of food aisles may be found crown end displays, where high-margin goods are displayed for impulse purchase. In retail stores that do not primarily sell food, aisles containing products would be referred to either generically as merchandise aisles, or by the particular products contained in the aisle, e.g., \\"the gardening aisle\\", \\"the sports equipment aisle\\". Checkout aisles contain cash registers at which customers make their purchases. Regardless of the type of merchandise the establishment sells, it is common to display a range of \\"impulse buy\\" items along the checkout aisle, such as cold beverages, magazines, candy and batteries. These are often called \\"lanes\\" to distinguish them from the food aisles. =Signage= For customer convenience, supermarkets and retail stores commonly number the aisles and have signs indicating both the aisle number and the types of products displayed in that aisle. Churches, courtrooms, legislatures, and meeting halls may identify individual rows, seats or sections but do not normally assign aisle numbers or display signs regarding aisles. Libraries U.S. Library of Congress reading room with aisles. Libraries are commonly divided into several areas: *Circulation desk *Collections, areas where materials are grouped, e.g., Children's Collection. This may include book shelves, manuscripts, photos, etc. *The \\"stacks\\", where books are shelved *The Reference Room where materials with limited circulation are stored *Public reading areas containing seats and desks The spaces between rows of book shelves in the \\"stacks\\" area are called aisles and desks in the reading area are frequently arranged in rows with aisles.  Computer server rooms An aisle between Wikimedia servers Server rooms are typically divided into hot and cold aisles for cooling efficiency, and access to servers. Indoor theatres and concert halls Theatre-type seating in a lecture hall with a stair aisle. Films, stage plays and musical concerts ordinarily are presented in a darkened facility so the audience can see the presentation better. To improve safety, often the edges of the aisles in such facilities are marked with a row of small lights. The markers frequently are strings of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) because LEDs are durable, have low power consumption and use low voltages that are not subject to electrical codes. To provide a higher level of light focused downward, lighting fixtures referred to as luminaries are often built into the side of the seat facing the aisle. Stadiums and outdoor arenas Sport stadiums and outdoor arenas frequently have several types of aisles, including aisles to purchase tickets for events, aisles to enter the main event area and aisles to go to seating. Stadium seating routinely is separated into sections by aisles. Seating rows are accessed by stairsteps. To promote safety, aisles commonly are divided by a handrail in the middle of the aisle. End zone of Qwest field with blue seats and grey aisles Closer view of seats. Stables and barns The Shilton Barn, Oxfordshire, England has three aisles and six bays The floor plan of aisled barns resembles that of an aisled church. However, the nave in farm buildings is called an aisle thus a \\"three aisled barn\\".Upton, Dell, and John Michael Vlach. Common places: readings in American vernacular architecture. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1986. 206. Aisled barns have the big barn doors on the gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making the barn symmetrical or the aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside the barn because the barn doors are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle. Safety and regulatory considerations National and local government regulations require a minimum width for aisles in various building types. Regulatory agencies frequently inspect buildings, vehicles, etc., to enforce regulations requiring that aisles not be restricted. Inspectors have imposed fines for blocking or restricting passage when boxes or folding chairs are stored in aisles, for example. Insurance companies frequently have safety inspectors to examine the premises, both to determine whether insureds are complying with the insurer's requirements for coverage and to look for any practices that could lead to injury or property damage, including restricting passage in aisles. The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain standards for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S.The ADA Standards for Accessible Design are part of the ADA Title III regulations An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access or use of a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair.The ADA Small Business Guide provides information on removing architectural barriers. Often, the only way to get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area. Regulations applicable to public carriers transporting passengers often require aisles to be completely clear in vehicles, such as airlines, buses and trains. Many insurance companies have requirements regarding minimum aisle width, unrestricted aisles and easy access to exits, and will refuse to insure companies that do not meet their requirements or will increase the premiums on companies that frequently violate the requirements.

History  =Formation, The Yearning (2001‚Äì2005)= Aisles was formed in 2001 by Germ√°n Vergara (guitar, vocals), his brother Luis (keyboards), and childhood friend Rodrigo Sep√∫lveda (guitar, vocals). Alejandro Mel√©ndez, originally from Brazil, joined the band in 2002. When looking for lead singers, the band asked Germ√°n and Luis‚Äô younger brother, Sebasti√°n, to record a demo with the intent of auditioning prospective lead singers but, surprised by his vocal skills, asked him to be their permanent vocalist. The band's first line up was then complete. After playing gigs at local clubs and bars, the band entered the studio in 2003 with the aim of recording its first demo for promotional purposes, but having achieved such a high quality of sound and interpretation decided to release that effort as their first full-length album. The Yearning (2005) was mixed and mastered over a span of ten weeks, and was subsequently released and distributed in South America, Europe, the United States, and Japan receiving generally positive reviews by specialized press. Fran√ßoise Couture of Allmusic wrote \\"The Yearning, Chilean band Aisles' first calling card, is a convincing disc of South American-flavored neo-progressive rock. Nothing gets reinvented. But the lads clearly know what they are doing\\",The Yearning ‚Äì Aisles. Allmusic review. http://www.allmusic.com/album/the- yearning-mw0001897469 while Conor Fines of Prog Sphere stated \\"based on its own merits, Aisles‚Äô The Yearning is a very good debut. Melody, strong songwriting, admirable performances, and enough details in the music to be worth going back to quite a few times makes the album an unlikely winner.\\"The Yearning ‚Äì Aisles. Prog sphere reviews http://www.prog- sphere.com/reviews/aisles-the-yearning/ =Touring, In Sudden Walks (2006‚Äì2011)= After the release of its debut album, the band spent most of 2006 touring in the local circuit, playing in venues such as House of Rock, Subterr√°neo, and a number of theatres across the country. In 2006, Felipe Gonz√°lez joined the band to play bass during live performances and in late 2007 Felipe Candia joined the band on drums to start rehearsals for Aisles' second album. The works for the band's second album extended for over a year. This time the group took a darker, more visual approach, mixing elements of music and drama, as shown in the opening track, ‚ÄúMariachi‚Äù. The broadening sound, the inclusion of genres such as Latin music, and the high sound quality and production made many consider the album a leap forward. In Sudden Walks was self-produced and released in January, 2009. Once again, the album was well received by fans and critics. Cesar Inca of Prog Archives said ‚ÄúIn Sudden Walks may have been one of the 5 most accomplished neo-prog albums of 2009. It is a lovely collection of inventive compositions and bold arrangements‚Äù,In Sudden Walks review. http://www.progarchives.com/review.asp?id=263687 while David Dashifen Kees of USA Progressive Music stated ‚ÄúFrom moment one, the album reveals a unique composition of sounds which display an understanding of music and a depth of theme and creativity that many other bands lack.\\"Aisles ‚Äì In Sudden Walks http://usaprogmusic.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_simple_review&Itemid;=28&review;=442-Aisles- In-Sudden-Walks In August 2009, Aisles was the only South American band invited to participate in the Crescendo Prog Rock festival in Saint-Palais Sur Mer, France, and was later nominated for the Prog Awards in Best Foreign Record category in Italy. After touring Europe, the band spent the rest of 2010 playing in its home country, in venues such as Sala SCD, Sala Master, Teatro Nemesio Ant√∫nez, and Caf√© del Teatro, among others. In late 2010, keyboardist Luis Vergara left the band due to musical differences. =4:45 AM (2011‚Äì2014)= In the second half of 2011, Daniel Baird-Kerr joined the band as a full-time bassist to start rehearsals for the band's upcoming album. With a new line up, and a strong desire to internationalize their career, Aisles started working on their third album. 4:45 AM was recorded in several studios in Santiago between July 2012 and August 2013, with production duties taken by guitarist Germ√°n Vergara. The album had a greater emphasis on visual aesthetics, taking elements from drama and other art forms. 4:45 AM was released in October 2013 through Presagio Records. The album was critically acclaimed; Brian McKinnon of Prog Rock Music Talk said: \\"\\"4:45 AM is nothing short of a masterwork of art. It is the reason people fall in love with music in the first place. An astounding piece of work for the ages\\".Progressive Rock Review: 4:45 AM http://www.progrockmusictalk.com/2015/02/aisles445amreview.html Breakout, one of Germany's most long-established rock magazines, chose \\"4:45 AM\\" as one of the best albums of the month. The album was released at a show on October 22, 2014, at Teatro Ladr√≥n de Bicycletas, in Santiago de Chile. A couple of months before this shows, keyboardist Alejandro Mel√©ndez left, and was replaced by his friend Juan Pablo Gaete. =Hawaii (2015‚Äìpresent)= In July 2015, the band started writing songs for their upcoming new album at a beach house, where they stayed for a week. The recording sessions took place in November, 2015, for ten days, at the prestigious Estudio del Sur, in Maria Pinto, 54 km west of the Chilean capital.Aisles-Hawaii-Episode 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9fU-PSp1wc&t;=182s 'Hawaii' is a two-disc concept album about human colonies established in space after the destruction of the Earth.

Following the invention of the transistor, the first commercial transistor radio, the Regency TR-1, was released in 1954. The mass- market success of the smaller and cheaper Sony TR-63, released in 1957, led to the transistor radio becoming the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s and 1970s. Transistor radios are still commonly used as car radios. Billions of transistor radios are estimated to have been sold worldwide between the 1950s and 2012. The pocket size of transistor radios sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went. Beginning around 1980, however, cheap AM transistor radios were superseded initially by the boombox and the Sony Walkman, and later on by digitally-based devices with higher audio quality such as portable CD players, personal audio players, MP3 players and (eventually) by smartphones, many of which contain FM radios. Background A seven-transistor USSR radio Orljonok with the back open, showing parts. Before the transistor was invented, radios used vacuum tubes. Although portable vacuum tube radios were produced, they were typically bulky and heavy. The need for a low voltage high current source to power the filaments of the tubes and high voltage for the anode potential typically required two batteries. Vacuum tubes were also inefficient and fragile compared to transistors and had a limited lifetime. Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first transistor on December 23, 1947. The scientific team at Bell Laboratories responsible for the solid-state amplifier included William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain, and John Bardeen. After obtaining patent protection, the company held a news conference on June 30, 1948, at which a prototype transistor radio was demonstrated. There are many claimants to the title of the first company to produce practical transistor radios, often incorrectly attributed to Sony (originally Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). Texas Instruments had demonstrated all-transistor AM (amplitude modulation) radios as early as May 25, 1954,Invention and Technology Magazine, Fall 2004, Volume 20 Issue 2, \\"The Revolution in your Pocket\\", Author: Robert J. SimcoeBook Title: TI, the Transistor, and Me, Author: Ed Millis, page 34 but their performance was well below that of equivalent vacuum tube models. A workable all-transistor radio was demonstrated in August 1953 at the D√ºsseldorf Radio Fair by the German firm Intermetall.Article: \\"The French Transistor\\", Author: Armand Van Dormael, page 15, Source: IEEE Global History Network It was built with four of Intermetall's hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948 invention of the \\"Transistor\\"-germanium point-contact transistor by Herbert Matar√© and Heinrich Welker. However, as with the early Texas Instruments units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was never put into commercial production. RCA had demonstrated a prototype transistor radio as early as 1952, and it is likely that they and the other radio makers were planning transistor radios of their own, but Texas Instruments and Regency Division of I.D.E.A., were the first to offer a production model starting in October 1954.website: www.regencytr1.com, Regency TR-1 Transistor Radio History Sanyo 8S-P3 transistor radio, which received AM and shortwave bands. The use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes as the amplifier elements meant that the device was much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more resistant to physical shock. Since the transistor's base element draws current, its input impedance is low in contrast to the high input impedance of the vacuum tubes. page 32 It also allowed \\"instant-on\\" operation, since there were no filaments to heat up. The typical portable tube radio of the fifties was about the size and weight of a lunchbox and contained several heavy, non-rechargeable batteries ‚Äî one or more so-called \\"A\\" batteries to heat the tube filaments and a large 45- to 90-volt \\"B\\" battery to power the signal circuits. By comparison, the transistor radio could fit in a pocket and weighed half a pound or less, and was powered by standard flashlight batteries or a single compact 9-volt battery. The 9-volt battery was introduced for powering transistor radios.  Early commercial transistor radios  = Regency TR-1 = Regency TR-1. Two companies working together, Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas, and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana, were behind the unveiling of the Regency TR-1, the world's first commercially produced transistor radio. Previously, Texas Instruments was producing instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1, looking to grow revenues for their respective companies by breaking into this new product area. In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. (The Chief Project Engineer for the radio design at Texas Instruments' headquarters in Dallas, Texas was Paul D. Davis, Jr., who had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Methodist University. He was assigned the project due to his experience with radio engineering in World War II.) None of the major radio makers including RCA, GE, Philco, and Emerson were interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios at \\"20 million radios in three years\\". The Regency TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954, by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A., was put on sale in November 1954 and was the first practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers. Billboard reported in 1954 that \\"the radio has only four transistors. One acts as a combination mixer- oscillator, one as an audio amplifier, and two as intermediate-frequency amplifiers.\\" One year after the release of the TR-1 sales approached the 100,000 mark. The look and size of the TR-1 was well received, but the reviews of the TR-1's performance were typically adverse. The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, , former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A. = Raytheon 8-TP-1 = In February 1955, the second transistor radio, the 8-TP-1, was introduced by Raytheon. It was a larger portable transistor radio, including an expansive four-inch speaker and four additional transistors (the TR-1 used only four). As a result, the sound quality was much better than the TR-1. An additional benefit of the 8-TP-1 was its efficient battery consumption. In July 1955, the first positive review of a transistor radio appeared in the Consumer Reports that said, \\"The transistors in this set have not been used in an effort to build the smallest radio on the market, and good performance has not been sacrificed.\\" Following the success of the 8-TP-1, Zenith, RCA, DeWald, and Crosley began flooding the market with additional transistor radio models. = Chrysler Mopar 914HR = 1955 Chrysler ‚Äì Philco all transistor car radio ‚Äì \\"Breaking News\\" radio broadcast announcement. Chrysler and Philco announced that they had developed and produced the world's first all-transistor car radio in the April 28th 1955 edition of the Wall Street Journal.Wall Street Journal, \\"Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56\\", April 28th 1955, page 1 Chrysler made the all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, available as an \\"option\\" in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which hit the showroom floor on October 21, 1955. The all-transistor car radio was a $150 option.Chrysler Imperial Owners Manual, 1956, Page 13 Japanese transistor radios While on a trip to the United States in 1952, Masaru Ibuka, founder of Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation (now Sony), discovered that AT&T; was about to make licensing available for the transistor. Ibuka and his partner, physicist Akio Morita, convinced the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to finance the $25,000 licensing fee (equivalent to $ today). For several months Ibuka traveled around the United States borrowing ideas from the American transistor manufacturers. Improving upon the ideas, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation made its first functional transistor radio in 1954. Within five years, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation grew from seven employees to approximately five hundred. Other Japanese companies soon followed their entry into the American market and the grand total of electronic products exported from Japan in 1958 increased 2.5 times in comparison to 1957. =Sony TR-55= In August 1955, while still a small company, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation introduced their TR-55 five-transistor radio under the new brand name Sony. page 35 With this radio, Sony became the first company to manufacture the transistors and other components they used to construct the radio. The TR-55 was also the first transistor radio to utilize all miniature components. It is estimated that only 5,000 to 10,000 units were produced. =Sony TR-63= The circuit of a Japanese 5 transistor radio. The TR-63 was introduced by Sony to the United States in December 1957. The TR-63 was narrower and shorter than the original Regency TR-1. Like the TR-1 it was offered in four colors: lemon, green, red, and black. In addition to its smaller size, the TR-63 had a small tuning capacitor and required a new battery design to produce the proper voltage. It used the nine-volt battery, which would become the standard for transistor radios. Approximately 100,000 units of the TR-63 were imported in 1957. This \\"pocketable\\" (the term \\"pocketable\\" was a matter of some interpretation, as Sony allegedly had special shirts made with oversized pockets for their salesmen) model proved highly successful. The TR-63 was the first transistor radio to sell in the millions, leading to the mass-market penetration of transistor radios. The TR-63 went on to sell seven million units worldwide by the mid-1960s. With the visible success of the TR-63, Japanese competitors such as Toshiba and Sharp Corporation joined the market. By 1959, in the United States market, there were more than six million transistor radio sets produced by Japanese companies that represented $62 million in revenue. The success of transistor radios led to transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the dominant electronic technology in the late 1950s. The transistor radio went on to become the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s and 1970s. Billions of transistor radios are estimated to have been sold worldwide between the 1950s and 2012.  Pricing  Prior to the Regency TR-1, transistors were difficult to produce. Only one in five transistors that were produced worked as expected (only a 20% yield) and as a result the price remained extremely high. When it was released in 1954, the Regency TR-1 cost $49.95 (equivalent to $ today) and sold about 150,000 units. Raytheon and Zenith Electronics transistor radios soon followed and were priced even higher. In 1955, Raytheon's 8-TR-1 was priced at $80 (equivalent to $ today). By November 1956 a transistor radio small enough to wear on the wrist and a claimed battery life of 100 hours cost $29.95. Sony's TR-63, released in December 1957, cost $39.95 (equivalent to $ today). Following the success of the TR-63 Sony continued to make their transistor radios smaller. Because of the extremely low labor costs in Japan, Japanese transistor radios began selling for as low as $25. By 1962, the TR-63 cost as low as $15 (equivalent to $ today), which led to American manufacturers dropping prices of transistor radios down to $15 as well. In popular culture Transistor radios were extremely successful because of three social forces ‚Äî a large number of young people due to the post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom, a public with disposable income amidst a period of prosperity, and the growing popularity of rock 'n' roll music. The influence of the transistor radio during this period is shown by its appearance in popular films, songs, and books of the time, such as the movie Lolita. In the late 1950s, transistor radios took on more elaborate designs as a result of heated competition. Eventually, transistor radios doubled as novelty items. The small components of transistor radios that became smaller over time were used to make anything from \\"Jimmy Carter Peanut-shaped\\" radios to \\"Gun-shaped\\" radios to \\"Mork from Ork Eggship-shaped\\" radios. Corporations used transistor radios to advertise their business. \\"Charlie the Tuna-shaped\\" radios could be purchased from Star- Kist for an insignificant amount of money giving their company visibility amongst the public. These novelty radios are now bought and sold as collectors' items amongst modern-day collectors.  Rise of portable audio players  An early 2000s transistor radio (Sony Walkman SRF-S84 transistor radio, released 2001, shown without earphones) Since 1980, the popularity of portable radios has declined with the rise of portable audio players and smartphones, which allow users to carry and listen to the music of their choosing and may also include a radio tuner. This began in the late 1970s with boom boxes and portable cassette players such as the Sony Walkman, followed by portable CD players. A common type now is the portable digital audio player. This type of device is a popular choice with listeners who are dissatisfied with terrestrial music radio because of a limited selection of music and reception problems. However, transistor radios are still popular for news, talk radio, weather, live sporting events, and emergency alert applications.

The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature, with the delusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe is in disguise. A person with the Fregoli delusion can also inaccurately recall places, objects, and events. This disorder can be explained by \\"associative nodes\\". The associative nodes serve as a biological link of information about other people with a particular familiar face (to the patient). This means that for any face that is similar to a recognizable face to the patient, the patient will recall that face as the person they know.Tibbetts, Paul. \\" Symbolic Interaction Theory and the Cognitively Disabled: A neglected Dimension.\\" Jstor. Winter 2004. Web. 28 September 2011 Symbolic Interaction Theory and the Cognitively Disabled: A Neglected Dimension The Fregoli delusion is classed both as a monothematic delusion, since it only encompasses one delusional topic, and as a delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS), a class of delusional beliefs that involves misidentifying people, places, or objects. Like Capgras delusion, psychiatrists believe it is related to a breakdown in normal face perception. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of Fregoli's:https://www.pharmatutor.org/articles/fregoli-syndrome * delusions * visual memory deficit * deficit in self-monitoring * deficit in self-awareness * hallucinations * deficit in executive functions * deficit in cognitive flexibility * history of seizure activity * epileptogenic activity Causes =Levodopa treatment= Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is the precursor to several catecholamines, specifically of dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is clinically used to treat Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. Clinical studies have shown that the use of levodopa can lead to visual hallucinations and delusions. In most patients, delusions were more salient than hallucinations. With prolonged use of levodopa, the delusions occupy almost all of a patient's attention. In experimental studies, when the concentration of levodopa decreases, the number of reported delusions decreases as well. It has been concluded that delusions related to antiparkinsonian medications are one of the leading causes of Fregoli syndrome. =Traumatic brain injury= Injury to the right frontal and left temporo-parietal areas can cause Fregoli syndrome. Research by Feinberg, et al. has shown that significant deficits in executive and memory functions follow shortly after damage in the right frontal or left temporoparietal areas. Tests performed on patients that have suffered from a brain injury revealed that basic attention ability and visuomotor processing speed are typically normal. However, these patients made many errors when they were called to participate in detailed attention tasks. Selective attention tests involving auditory targets were also performed, and brain-injured patients had many errors; this meant that they were deficient in their response regulation and inhibition. The most profound finding in Feinberg et al.'s paper is that performance tests on the retrieval process of memory was significantly damaged in brain-injured patients. They found, however, that these patients chose incorrect answers that were related semantically (i.e., chose vegetable instead of fruit). More importantly, tests of visual memory showed that there was a severe inability in visual recollection. Overall, brain-injured patients were severely impaired in many executive functions such as self-monitoring, mental flexibility, and social reasoning. Fregoli syndrome is an illusion of positive doubles where there is an over-familiarity with the environment. This over-familiarity may have four causes: * impaired self monitoring ‚Äî passive acceptance of inaccurate conclusions * faulty filtering ‚Äî tendency to select salient associations rather than a relevant one * mnemonic association from routine thoughts * perseveration ‚Äî unable to come up with an alternate hypothesis Thus, executive dysfunction appears to be necessary to identify one as having Fregoli's syndrome.Pires-Barata, S., Gois, J. P., & da Silva, M. H. T. (2008). Fregoli's syndrome and traumatic brain injury. =Fusiform gyrus= Current research has shown that lesions in the right temporal lobe and the fusiform gyrus may contribute to DMSs. MRIs of patients exemplifying Fregoli symptoms have shown parahippocampal and hippocampal damage in the anterior fusiform gyrus, as well as the middle and inferior of the right temporal gyri. The inferior and medial of the right temporal gyri are the storage locations for long-term memory in retrieving information on visual recognition, specifically of faces; thus, damage to these intricate connections could be one of the leading factors in face misidentification disorders. Recently, a face-specific area in the fusiform gyrus has been discovered and is close to the anterior fusiform gyrus. MRI studies performed by Hudson, et al. have shown lesions in the anterior fusiform gyrus, which is close to the face specific area (ventral fusiform cortex), may also be associated with Fregoli syndrome and other DMSs. Such damage may cause disruption in long-term visual memory and lead to improper associations of human faces. On another note, our brains interpret visual scenes in two pathways: one is via the Parietal lobe- occipital dorsal pathway (visual spatial material is analyzed here), and the other is via the temporal-occipital ventral pathway (recognizes objects and faces). Thus, lesions in either structures or disruption of delicate connections may produce DMSs. =Abnormal P300= Delusional misidentification syndrome is thought to occur due to a dissociation between identification and recognition processes. The integration of information for further processing is referred to as working memory (WM). The P300 (P stands for positive voltage potential and the 300 for the 300-millisecond poststimulus) is an index of WM and is used during a WM test in DMS patients. In comparison to normal patients, DMS patients generally exhibit an attenuated amplitude of P300 at many abductions. These patients also exhibit prolonged latencies of P300 at all abductions. These implications suggest that DMSs are accompanied by abnormal WM, specifically affecting the prefrontal cortex (both outside and inside). Past studies have shown correlations between DMS and damages to the right-hemispheric function, which has an array of functions (insight, 3D shapes, art awareness, imagination, left-hand control, music awareness, etc.). In recent years, the P300 auditory component, which forms in response to a detection task that occurs a short time after a stimulus, has acquired a great deal of recognition. The P300 component is an index of mental activity in that its amplitude increases highly with increased stimuli. This P300 component is correlated with updating the working memory to what is expected in the environment. Other findings enhance the belief that defects in the working memory are associated with DMS. Papageorgio et al.'s paper, psychological evidence for altered information processing in delusional misidentification syndromes, hypothesized that electrophysiological brain activity in the working memory and P300 component can help identify the mechanisms of DMS. Thus, they concentrated on P300 released during a working memory test in DMS patients. Papageorgio et al. also found that DMS patients had a lower P300 amplitude in the right hemisphere compared to the control group (non-DMS patients). From this result, the researchers implied that shorter P300 amplitudes are highly correlated with gray matter abnormalities; this finding is consistent with the DMS patients' characteristics and the presence of gray- matter deterioration. DMS patients were also found to have prolonged P300 lag, and their memory performance was lower than the control groups. The researchers were, thus, able to imply that DMS patients have trouble in focusing their resources to a stimulus; this was hypothesized to be caused by the neurodegeneration of the right hemisphere. Overall, other research studies have also provided evidence in the correlation of DMS and gray-matter degeneration of the right frontal region, which controls attentional resources. This research is important, because it can help determine the mechanisms of DMS, which can then help conjure a more effective target drug and/or treatment plan for those suffering from DMS. Treatment Once it has been positively identified, pharmacotherapy follows. Antipsychotic drugs are the frontrunners in treatment for Fregoli and other DMSs. In addition to antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants are also prescribed in some treatment courses. If a Fregoli patient has other psychological disorders, treatment often results in the use of trifluoperazine. History The condition is named after the Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, who was renowned for his ability to make quick changes of appearance during his stage act. P. Courbon and G. Fail first reported the condition in a 1927 paper (Syndrome d'illusion de Fr√©goli et schizophr√©nie). They described a 27-year- old woman living in London who believed she was being persecuted by two actors she often saw at the theatre. She believed these people pursued her closely, taking the form of people she knew or met. =Delusional misidentification syndromes and Fregoli= Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) are rooted in the inability to register the identity of something, whether it is an object, event, place or even a person. There are various forms of DMS, such as the syndrome of subjective doubles, intermetamorphosis, Capgras syndrome and Fregoli syndrome. However, all of these various syndromes have a common denominator: they are all due to malfunctional familiarity processing during information processing. The most common syndromes are Capgras and Fregoli. Capgras syndrome is the delusional belief that a friend, family member, etc., has been replaced by a twin impostor. Fregoli syndrome is the delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who is in disguise. Other commonalities among these syndromes are that they are discriminatory in which object(s) are misidentified. Lastly, dopamine hyperactivity is evident in all DMSs and thus, all syndromes utilize antipsychotic medications to help control DMS. =Coexistence of Capgras and Fregoli= Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMSs) are four types of syndromes: the syndrome of subjective doubles, the syndrome of intermetamorphosis, Fregoli delusion and Capgras syndrome. Of the four, Fregoli syndrome is the least frequent, followed by Capgras. Of more rarity is the coexistence of both Fregoli and Capgras syndromes. Coexistence of DMSs are enhanced when coupled with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. Depersonalization and derealization symptoms are usually manifested in patients exhibiting two misidentification delusions. However, such symptoms have been witnessed to cease once the coexisting DMSs are fully developed. Current research The study of DMS currently remains controversial, as they are often coupled with many psychological disorders (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc.). Although there is a plethora of information on DMS, there are still many mysteries of the physiological and anatomical details of DMS. An accurate semiological analysis of higher visual anomalies and their corresponding topographic sites may help elucidate the aetiology of Fregoli's and other misidentification disorders. Popular culture Charlie Kaufman's 2015 film Anomalisa has several direct and indirect references to the Fregoli delusion. Kaufman adapted the screenplay from his 2005 audio play Anomalisa, written under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli, and the hotel that Michael stays in is called \\"The Fregoli\\". The science fiction short story ‚ÄúLiking What You See: A Documentary‚Äù, from the collection Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang, refers to Fregoli syndrome in the context of artificial targeted neurological impairment. In March 2020, the delusion was covered in an episode of the BBC medical soap opera Doctors when Lizzie Milton (Adele James) believes she is being stalked by Joe Pasquale.

It is the same species as the domestic turkey, which was originally derived from a southern Mexican subspecies of wild turkey (not the related ocellated turkey). Although native to North America, the turkey probably got its name from the domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the Levant via Spain. The British at the time therefore associated the wild turkey with the country Turkey and the name prevails.Webster's II New College Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2005, , p. 1217Andrew F.

Description Closeup of wild turkey hen Adult wild turkeys have long reddish-yellow to grayish-green legs. The body feathers are generally blackish and dark, sometimes grey brown overall with a coppery sheen that becomes more complex in adult males. Adult males, called toms or gobblers, have a large, featherless, reddish head, red throat, and red wattles on the throat and neck. The head has fleshy growths called caruncles. Juvenile males are called jakes; the difference between an adult male and a juvenile is that the jake has a very short beard and his tail fan has longer feathers in the middle. The adult male's tail fan feathers will be all the same length.Wild Turkey Identification and Anatomy. NWTF. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. When males are excited, a fleshy flap on the bill expands, and this, the wattles and the bare skin of the head and neck all become engorged with blood, almost concealing the eyes and bill. The long fleshy object over a male's beak is called a snood. Each foot has three toes in front, with a shorter, rear-facing toe in back; males have a spur behind each of their lower legs. Closeup of wild turkey tom Male turkeys have a long, dark, fan-shaped tail and glossy bronze wings. As with many other species of the Galliformes, turkeys exhibit strong sexual dimorphism. The male is substantially larger than the female, and his feathers have areas of red, purple, green, copper, bronze, and gold iridescence. The preen gland (uropygial gland) is also larger in male turkeys compared to female ones. In contrast to the majority of other birds, they are colonized by bacteria of unknown function (Corynebacterium uropygiale). Females, called hens, have feathers that are duller overall, in shades of brown and gray. Parasites can dull coloration of both sexes; in males, coloration may serve as a signal of health. The primary wing feathers have white bars. Turkeys have 5000 to 6000 feathers.National wild turkey Federation: wild turkey Facts. Nwtf.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-21.

While it is usually rather lighter than the waterfowl, after the trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), the turkey has the second heaviest maximum weight of any North American bird. Going on average mass, several other birds on the continent, including the American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), the tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) and the very rare California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) and whooping crane (Grus americana) surpass the mean weight of turkeys.Dunning, John B. Jr. (ed.). (1992). CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses. CRC Press. . Habitat Eastern subspecies Wild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer- hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures, fields, orchards and seasonal marshes. They seemingly can adapt to virtually any dense native plant community as long as coverage and openings are widely available. Open, mature forest with a variety of interspersion of tree species appear to be preferred. In the Northeast of North America, turkeys are most profuse in hardwood timber of oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) and forests of red oak (Quercus rubra), beech (Fagus grandifolia), cherry (Prunus serotina) and white ash (Fraxinus americana). Best ranges for turkeys in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont sections have an interspersion of clearings, farms, and plantations with preferred habitat along principal rivers and in cypress (Taxodium distichum) and tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) swamps. In Appalachian and Cumberland plateaus, birds occupy mixed forest of oaks and pines on southern and western slopes, also hickory with diverse understories. Bald cypress and sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) swamps of s. Florida; also hardwood of Cliftonia (a heath) and oak in north-central Florida. Lykes Fisheating Creek area of s. Florida has up to 51% cypress, 12% hardwood hammocks, 17% glades of short grasses with isolated live oak (Quercus virginiana); nesting in neighboring prairies. Original habitat here was mainly longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) with turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and slash pine (Pinus caribaea) \\"flatwoods,\\" now mainly replaced by slash pine plantations. Behavior =Flight= Wild turkey agile in flight Wild turkey, fast flier Despite their weight, wild turkeys, unlike their domesticated counterparts, are agile, fast fliers. In ideal habitat of open woodland or wooded grasslands,Hogan, C. Michael (2008). Wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg they may fly beneath the canopy top and find perches. They usually fly close to the ground for no more than 400 m (a quarter mile). Wild turkeys have very good eyesight, but their vision is very poor at night. They will not see a predator until it is too late. At twilight most turkeys will head for the trees and roost well off the ground, up to 16 meters: it is safer to sleep there in numbers than to risk being victim to predators who hunt by night. Because wild turkeys don't migrate, in snowier parts of the species's habitat like the Northeast, Rockies, much of Canada, and the Midwest, it is very important for this bird to learn to select large conifer trees where they can fly onto the branches and shelter from blizzards. =Vocalizations= Turkeys have many vocalizations: \\"gobbles\\", \\"clucks\\", \\"putts\\", \\"purrs\\", \\"yelps\\", \\"cutts\\", \\"whines\\", \\"cackles\\", and \\"kee-kees\\". In early spring, males older than a year old (sometimes called gobblers or toms) and, occasionally to a lesser extent, males younger than a year old (sometimes called \\"jakes\\") gobble to announce their presence to females and competing males. The gobble of a wild turkey can be heard up to a mile away. Males also emit a low-pitched \\"drumming\\" sound, produced by the movement of air in the air sack in the chest, similar to the booming of a prairie chicken. In addition they produce a sound known as the \\"spit\\" which is a sharp expulsion of air from this air sack. Females also gobble like males, but sparingly; they \\"yelp\\" to let males know their location. Both adult and immature males often yelp like females. =Foraging= Hen with poults Wild turkeys are omnivorous, foraging on the ground or climbing shrubs and small trees to feed. They prefer eating acorns, nuts and other hard mast of various trees, including hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pinyon pine as well as various seeds, berries such as juniper and bearberry, roots and insects. Turkeys also occasionally consume amphibians and small reptiles such as lizards and small snakes. Poults have been observed eating insects, berries, and seeds. Wild turkeys often feed in cow pastures, sometimes visit back yard bird feeders, and favor croplands after harvest to scavenge seeds on the ground. Turkeys are also known to eat a wide variety of grasses. Turkey populations can reach large numbers in small areas because of their ability to forage for different types of food. Early morning and late afternoon are the desired times for eating. =Social structure and mating= Nest found in Nelson County, Virginia Males are polygamous, mating with as many hens as they can. Male wild turkeys display for females by puffing out their feathers, spreading out their tails and dragging their wings. This behavior is most commonly referred to as strutting. Their heads and necks are colored brilliantly with red, white, and blue. The color can change with the turkey's mood, with a solid white head and neck being the most excited. They use gobbling, drumming/booming and spitting as signs of social dominance, and to attract females. Courtship begins during the months of March and April, which is when turkeys are still flocked together in winter areas. Males may be seen courting in groups, often with the dominant male gobbling, spreading his tail feathers (strutting), drumming/booming and spitting. In a study, the average dominant male that courted as part of a pair of males fathered six more eggs than males that courted alone. Genetic analysis of pairs of males courting together shows that they are close relatives, with half of their genetic material being identical. The theory behind the team-courtship is that the less dominant male would have a greater chance of passing along shared genetic material than if it were courting alone. When mating is finished, females search for nest sites. Nests are shallow dirt depressions engulfed with woody vegetation. Hens lay a clutch of 10‚Äì14 eggs, usually one per day. The eggs are incubated for at least 28 days. The poults are precocial and nidifugous, leaving the nest in about 12‚Äì24 hours. Predators Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), groundhogs (Marmota monax), other rodents and spotted skunks (Spilogale ssp.). Predators of poults in addition to nestlings and eggs also include several species of snake, namely rat snakes (Elaphe ssp.), gopher snakes (Pituophis catenifer) and pinesnakes (Pituophis ssp.). Avian predators of poults include raptors such as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), barred owl (Strix varia), red-shouldered (Buteo lineatus), red-tailed (Buteo jamaicensis), white-tailed (Geranoaetus albicaudatus), and Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus)‚Äîand the smallish Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) and broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus) (both likely of very small poults). Mortality of poults is greatest in the first 14 days of life, especially of those roosting on the ground, decreasing most notably after half a year, when they attain near adult sizes. Hen with juveniles In addition to poults, hens and adult-sized fledglings (but not, as far as is known, adult male toms) are vulnerable to predation by great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic cats (Felis catus), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Predators of both adults and poults include coyotes (Canis latrans), gray wolves (Canis lupus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), cougars (Puma concolor), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and possibly American black bears (Ursus americanus), which also will eat the eggs if they find them. The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a predator to all turkeys of all ages in the Southeast and will eat them if they get too close to water. Humans are now the leading predator of adult turkeys.ADW: Meleagris gallopavo: INFORMATION. Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu (2006-03-12). Retrieved on 2012-08-21.Kennamer, James Earl. Predators and Wild Turkeys. NWTF Wildlife Bulletin NO.16 When approached by potential predators, turkeys and their poults usually run away rather than fly away from potential predators, though they may also fly short distances if pressed. Occasionally, if cornered, adult turkeys may try to fight off predators and large male toms can be especially aggressive in self-defense. When fighting off predators, turkeys may kick with their legs, using the spurs on their back of the legs as a weapon, bite with their beak and ram with their relatively large bodies and may be able to deter predators up to the size of mid-sized mammals.Wild Turkey Predators, Wild Turkey Predation: National Wild Turkey Federation.

Hen turkeys have been seen to chase off at least two species of hawks in flight when their poults are threatened. Wild turkeys are not usually aggressive towards humans, but can be frightened or provoked to behave with aggression. They are most likely to attack if startled, cornered or harassed, or if approached too closely. They also have been seen to chase off humans as well. However, attacks and potential injuries can usually be avoided by giving wild turkeys a respectful amount of space and keeping outdoor spaces clean and undisturbed.Living with wildlife: Turkey: Minnesota DNR. Dnr.state.mn.us. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. Also, turkeys that are habituated to seeing people, at places like parks or campgrounds, can be very tame and will even feed from the hands of people. Male toms occasionally will attack parked cars and reflective surfaces, thinking they see another turkey and must defend their territory, but starting a car engine and moving the car is typically enough to scare it away. Range and population The wild turkey in the United States in 1957 ranged from Arizona to southeastern Oklahoma and thence through Tennessee, West Virginia, and New York, and south to Florida and Texas. It formerly ranged north to southeastern South Dakota, southern Wisconsin, southern Ontario, and southwestern Maine.The American Ornithologists' Union Check-list (5th ed., 1957). The A.O.U. Checklist also described Upper Pliocene fossils in Kansas, and Pleistocene fossils widely from New Mexico to Pennsylvania and Florida.Don Roberson, \\"Wild Turkey: A Native California Bird?\\" -- with an excellent map of the pre-Columbian range of the Wild Turkey and the sites of various fossils from the late Pleistocene citing The Californian turkey, Meleagris californica, is an extinct species of turkey indigenous to the Pleistocene and early Holocene of California. It became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The present Californian wild turkey population derives from wild birds re-introduced during the 1960s and 70s from other areas by game officials.California Department of Fish and Game. Wild Turkey Guide 2005. They proliferated after 2000 to become an everyday sight in the East Bay Area by 2015. At the beginning of the 20th century the range and numbers of wild turkeys had plummeted due to hunting and loss of habitat. When Europeans arrived in the New World, they were found from Canada to Mexico in the millions. Europeans and their successors knew nothing about the life cycle of the bird and ecology itself as a science would come too late, not even in its infancy until the end of the 19th century whereas heavy hunting began in the 17th century. Deforestation destroyed trees turkeys need to roost in. Destruction of subtypes of environment like prairie grassland in the Midwest, canebrakes in the Southeast, and pine in the desert highlands made them easy prey for predators as there was nowhere to hide or lay eggs. Game managers estimate that the entire population of wild turkeys in the United States was as low as 30,000 by the late 1930s. By the 1940s, it was almost totally extirpated from Canada and had become localized in pockets in the United States, in the north-east effectively restricted to the Appalachians, only as far north as central Pennsylvania. Early attempts used hand reared birds, a practice that failed miserably as the birds were unable to survive in the wild at all and many had imprinted far too much on people and did not think they were birds. Game officials later made efforts to protect and encourage the breeding of the surviving wild population. They would wait for numbers to grow, catch the surplus birds with a device that would have a projectile net that would esnare the creature, move it to another unoccupied territory, and repeat the cycle. Over time this included some in the western states where it was not native. There is evidence that the bird does well when near farmland, which provides grain and also berry-bearing shrubs at its edges.Dickson, pp. 368-379 As wild turkey numbers rebounded, hunting became legal in 49 U.S. states (excluding Alaska). In 1973, the total U.S. population was estimated to be 1.3 million, and current estimates place the entire wild turkey population at 7 million individuals. Since the 1980s, \\"trap and transfer\\" projects have reintroduced wild turkeys to several provinces of Canada as well, sometimes from across the border in the United States. They appear to be very successful as of 2018 as wild turkeys have multiplied rapidly and flourished in places where they were not expected to survive by Canadian scientists, often quite far north of their original expected range. Attempts to introduce the wild turkey to Britain as a game bird in the 18th century were not successful.These birds were imported from Mexico, then called the Spanish West Indies. They did not come from Turkey or India, as was widely believed. \\"Talking Turkey\\", World Wide Words. On line. George II is said to have had a flock of a few thousand in Richmond Park near London, but they were too easy for local poachers to destroy, and the fights with poachers became too dangerous for the gamekeepers. They were hunted with dogs and then shot out of trees where they took refuge. Several other populations, introduced or escaped, have survived for periods elsewhere in Britain and Ireland, but seem to have died out, perhaps from a combination of lack of winter feed and poaching.Dickson, p. 363; Maxwell, William Hamilton, The field book; or, Sports and pastimes of the British islands, by the author of 'Wild sports of the West, p. 540, London, 1833, Internet Archive Small populations, probably descended from farm as well as wild stock, in the Czech Republic and Germany have been more successful, and there are wild populations of some size following introductions in Hawaii and New Zealand.Dickson, pp. 363-368 Subspecies There are subtle differences in the coloration, habitat, and behavior of the different subspecies of wild turkeys. The six subspecies are: Eastern wild turkey =Eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) (Viellot, 1817)= This was the turkey subspecies Europeans first encountered in the wild: by the Puritans, the founders of Jamestown, the Dutch who lived in New York, and by the Acadians. Its range is one of the largest of all subspecies, covering the entire eastern half of the United States from Maine in the north to northern Florida and extending as far west as Minnesota, Illinois, and into Missouri. In Canada, its range extends into Southeastern Manitoba, Ontario, Southwestern Quebec (including Pontiac, Quebec and the lower half of the Western Quebec Seismic Zone), and the Maritime Provinces. They number from 5.1 to 5.3 million birds. They were first named 'forest turkey' in 1817, and can grow up to tall. The upper tail coverts are tipped with chestnut brown. Males can reach in weight. The eastern wild turkey is heavily hunted in the Eastern USA and is the most hunted wild turkey subspecies. =Osceola wild turkey or Florida wild turkey (M. g. osceola) (Scott, 1890)= Most common in the Florida peninsula, they number from 80,000 to 100,000 birds. This bird is named for the famous Seminole leader Osceola, and was first described in 1890. It is smaller and darker than the eastern wild turkey. The wing feathers are very dark with smaller amounts of the white barring seen on other subspecies. Their overall body feathers are an iridescent green-purple color. They are often found in scrub patches of palmetto and occasionally near swamps, where amphibian prey is abundant. Osceola turkeys are the smallest subspecies weighing . Rio Grande wild turkey has relatively long legs =Rio Grande wild turkey (M. g. intermedia) (Sennett, 1879)= The Rio Grande wild turkey ranges through Texas to Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and was introduced to central and western California, as well as parts of a few northeastern states. It was also introduced to Hawaii in the late 1950s. Population estimates for this subspecies are around 1,000,000. This subspecies, native to the central plain states, was first described in 1879, and has relatively long legs, better adapted to a prairie habitat. Its body feathers often have a green-coppery sheen. The tips of the tail and lower back feathers are a buff-to-very light tan color. Its habitats are brush areas next to streams, rivers or mesquite, pine and scrub oak forests. The Rio Grande turkey is gregarious. =Merriam's wild turkey (M. g. merriami) (Nelson, 1900)= The Merriam's wild turkey ranges through the Rocky Mountains and the neighboring prairies of Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, as well as much of the high mesa country of New Mexico, Arizona, southern Utah and The Navajo Nation, with number from 334,460 to 344,460 birds. The subspecies has also been introduced into Oregon. The initial releases of Merriam's turkeys in 1961 resulted in establishing a remnant population of Merriam's turkeys along the east-slope of Mt. Hood and natural immigration of turkeys from Idaho has established Merriam's flocks along the eastern border of Oregon.\\"Oregon State Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, Wildlife Division, Wild Turkey Management Plan\\". Merriam's wild turkeys live in ponderosa pine and mountainous regions. The subspecies was named in 1900 in honor of Clinton Hart Merriam, the first chief of the U.S. Biological Survey. The tail and lower back feathers have white tips and purple and bronze reflections. =Gould's wild turkey (M. g. mexicana) (Gould, 1856)= Gould's wild turkey Native from the central valleys to the northern mountains of Mexico and the southernmost parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Gould's wild turkeys are heavily protected and regulated. The subspecies was first described in 1856. They exist in small numbers in the U.S. but are abundant in northwestern portions of Mexico. A small population has been established in southern Arizona. Gould's are the largest of the six subspecies. They have longer legs, larger feet, and longer tail feathers. The main colors of the body feathers are copper and greenish-gold. This subspecies is heavily protected owing to its skittish nature and threatened status. =South Mexican wild turkey (M. g. gallopavo) (Linnaeus, 1758)= The south Mexican wild turkey is considered the nominate subspecies, and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. In central Mexico, archaeological M. gallopavo bones have been identified at sites dating to 800‚Äì100 BC [10], [11]. It is unclear whether these early specimens represent wild or domestic individuals, but domestic turkeys were likely established in central Mexico by the first half of the Classic Period (c. AD 200‚Äì1000). Late Preclassic (300 BC‚ÄìAD 100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Pet√©n, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the south Mexican wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo) to the ancient Maya world. The south Mexican wild subspecies, M. g. gallopavo, was domesticated either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in Mesoamerica, giving rise to the domestic turkey (M. g. domesticus). The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from England, unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, guajolote. This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010. Benjamin Franklin and the myth of U.S. national bird suggestion Birds of America by John James Audubon The idea that Benjamin Franklin preferred the turkey as the national bird of the United States comes from a letter he wrote to his daughter Sarah Bache on January 26, 1784.\\"Benjamin Franklin to Sarah Bache, January 26, 1784\\".Library of Congress, Manuscript Division. The main subject of the letter is a criticism of the Society of the Cincinnati, which he likened to a chivalric order, which contradicted the ideals of the newly founded American republic. In one section of the letter, Franklin remarked on the appearance of the bald eagle on the Society's crest: Franklin never publicly voiced opposition to the bald eagle as a national symbol, nor did he ever publicly suggest the turkey as a national symbol.https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/franklin-national-bird Significance to Native Americans Eastern wild turkey (M. g. silvestris) hens The wild turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many Native American tribes all over North America. Outside of the Thanksgiving feast, it is a favorite meal in eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather. They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as Catawba chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses.Pritzker 367 Significant peoples of several tribes, including Muscogee Creek and Wampanoag, wore turkey feather cloaks.Pritzker 381, 474 The turkey clan is one of the three Lenape clans.Pritzker 423 Movements of wild turkeys inspired the Caddo tribe's turkey dance.\\"Caddo Nation Today.\\" Texas Beyond History. (retrieved 28 Dec 2010) The Navajo people of Northeastern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah call the turkey TƒÖzhii and relate the bird to the corn and seeds which The Turkey in Navajo folklore brought from the Third Navajo World.

Best known for her work, In a Different Voice (1982), Gilligan studied women's psychology and girls‚Äô development and co-authored or edited a number of texts with her students. She contributed the piece \\"Sisterhood Is Pleasurable: A Quiet Revolution in Psychology\\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan. She published her first novel, Kyra, in 2008. She is married to James Gilligan, M.D., who directed the Center for the Study of Violence at Harvard Medical School. =Psychology= Gilligan is known for her work with Lawrence Kohlberg on his stages of moral development as well as her criticism of his approach to the stages. Despite being Kohlberg's research assistant, Gilligan argued that Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development were male-oriented, which limited their ability to be generalized to females. In an article where Gilligan revisits In a Different Voice, she comments \\"I entered the conversation about women and morality in the late 1960s, a time in the U.S. that witnessed a convergence of the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, the movement to stop atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, the movement to end poverty, the women‚Äôs movement, and the gay liberation movement. I was teaching at Harvard with Erik Erikson, a psychoanalyst working in the Freudian tradition, and Lawrence Kohlberg, a cognitive-developmental psychologist working in the tradition of Piaget. To all these men‚ÄîFreud and Erikson, Piaget and Kohlberg‚Äîwomen appeared deficient in development\\".Gilligan, Carol. 2011. \\"Looking Back to Look Forward: Revisiting In a Different Voice.\\" Classics@, Issue 9, \\"Defense Mechanisms,\\" http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_Classicsat Gilligan thus proposed her theory of stages of female moral development based on her idea of moral voices. According to Gilligan, there are two kinds of moral voices: that of the masculine and the feminine. The masculine voice is \\"logical and individualistic\\", meaning that the emphasis in moral decisions is protecting the rights of people and making sure justice is upheld. The feminine voice places more emphasis on protecting interpersonal relationships and taking care of other people. This voice focuses on the \\"care perspective,\\" which means focusing on the needs of the individual in order to make an ethical decision. For Gilligan, Kohlberg's stages of moral development were emphasizing the masculine voice, making it difficult to accurately gauge a woman's moral development because of this incongruity in voices. Gilligan argues that androgyny, or integrating the masculine and the feminine, is the best way to realize one's potential as a human. Gilligan's stages of female moral development has been shown in business settings as an explanation to the different ways men and women handle ethical issues in the workplace as well. = In a Different Voice = Gilligan published what is considered one of her most influential works in 1982, after entering the dialogue regarding women and morality in the 1960s. Before she conducted her research Gilligan knew that \\"psychologists had assumed a culture in which men were the measure of humanity, and autonomy and rationality ('masculine' qualities) were the markers of maturity. It was a culture that counted on women not speaking for themselves‚Äù. To explore this theory further, Gilligan conducted her research using an interview method. Her questions centered around the self, morality and how women handle issues of conflict and choice. Her three studies that she references throughout the work were the college student study (moral development), the abortion decision study (experience of conflict), and the rights and responsibilities study (concepts of self and morality across men and women of different ages).Gilligan, Carol. In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2003. From these studies Gilligan formed the framework for her ethics of care. Furthermore, Gilligan introduces In a Different Voice by explaining that \\"the different voice I describe is characterized not by gender but theme. Its association with women is an empirical observation, and is primarily through women‚Äôs voices that I trace its development. But this association is not absolute and the contrasts between male and female voices are presented here to highlight a distinction between two modes of thought and to focus on a problem of interpretation rather than to represent a generalization about either sex.\\" Regardless of the findings Gilligan made from her study, her ethics of care and the fuel for her study have called future researchers to broaden the scope of studies and consider intersectionality more as well. = Ethics of care = In her book In a Different Voice Gilligan presented her ethics of care theory as an alternative to Lawrence Kohlberg's hierarchal and principled approach to ethics. In contrast to Kohlberg, who claimed that girls, and therefore also women, did not in general develop their moral abilities to the highest levels, Gilligan argued that women approached ethical problems differently from men. According to Gilligan, women's moral viewpoints center around the understanding of responsibilities and relationship whilst men's moral viewpoints instead center around the understanding of moral fairness, which is tied to rights and rules. Women also tend to see moral issues as a problem of conflicting responsibilities rather than competing rights. So whilst women perceive the situation as more contextual and narrative, men define the situation as more formal and abstract. In her 2011 article about In a Different Voice, Gilligan says she has made \\"a distinction [she] ha[s] come to see as pivotal to understanding care ethics. Within a patriarchal framework, care is a feminine ethic. Within a democratic framework, care is a human ethic. A feminist ethic of care is a different voice within a patriarchal culture because it joins reason with emotion, mind with body, self with relationships, men with women, resisting the divisions that maintain a patriarchal order‚Äù. She calls the different moral approaches \\"ethics of care\\" and \\"ethics of justice\\" and recognizes them as fundamentally incompatible.  Criticism  The Boston Globe stated that \\"In a Different Voice has been the subject of so many rebuttals that it is no longer taken seriously as an academic work\\", and that Gilligan's findings, that differences in moral reasoning had anything to do with gender, could not be replicated.\\"'' Unsurprised by such criticism, Gilligan responded she based her conclusions on interviews, not statistical surveys, and never meant for her ideas to be set in stone: ‚ÄúI thought of the book as the opening of a conversation,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúcertainly not the close of one.‚Äù Her ethics of care have been criticized by other feminist scholars such as Jaclyn Friedman, who argues that the different ethics of women and men are in fact a result of societal expectations. Since we expect women and men to think differently about ethics women and men as a result do present differences. The different modes of reasoning are therefore a socially constructed dichotomy simply reproducing itself through our expectations of how women and men act.

Launched in New York City in June 1850, it is the second-oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the U.S. (Scientific American is the oldest, although it did not become monthly until 1921). The previous editor James Marcus, said he was fired in April 2018 for opposing Katie Roiphe's essay. Harper's Magazine has won 22 National Magazine Awards. History Harper & Brothers founders in New York City by Fletcher, James, John and Joseph Wesley Harper (1860) An issue of Harper's from 1905 Harper's Magazine began as Harper's New Monthly Magazine in New York City in June 1850, by the New York City publisher Harper & Brothers. The company also founded the magazines Harper's Weekly and Harper's Bazaar, and grew to become HarperCollins Publishing. The first press run of Harper's Magazine‚Äî7,500 copies‚Äîsold out almost immediately. Circulation was some 50,000 issues six months later. The early issues reprinted material pirated from English authors such as Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and the Bront√´ sisters. The magazine soon was publishing the work of American artists and writers, and in time commentary by the likes of Winston Churchill and Woodrow Wilson. Portions of Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick were first published in the October 1851 issue of Harper's under the title, \\"The Town-Ho's Story\\" (titled after Chapter 54 of Moby Dick). In 1962, Harper & Brothers merged with Row, Peterson & Company, becoming Harper & Row (now HarperCollins). In 1965, the magazine was separately incorporated, and became a division of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company, owned by the Cowles Media Company. In the 1970s, Harper's Magazine published Seymour Hersh's reporting of the My Lai Massacre by United States forces in Vietnam. In 1971 editor Willie Morris resigned under pressure from owner John Cowles, Jr., prompting resignations from many of the magazine's star contributors and staffers, including Norman Mailer, David Halberstam, Robert Kotlowitz, Marshall Frady and Larry L. King: Robert Shnayerson, a senior editor at Time magazine, was hired to replace Morris as Harper's ninth editor, serving in that position from 1971 until 1976. Lewis H. Lapham served as managing editor from 1976 until 1981; he returned to the position again from 1983 until 2006. On June 17, 1980, the Star Tribune announced it would cease publishing Harper's Magazine after the August 1980 issue. But, on July 9, 1980, John R. MacArthur (who goes by the name Rick) and his father, Roderick, obtained pledges from the directorial boards of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Atlantic Richfield Company, and CEO Robert Orville Anderson to amass the $1.5 million needed to establish the Harper's Magazine Foundation. It now publishes the magazine.Facts on File 1980 Yearbook, pp.501, 582 In 1984, Lapham and MacArthur‚Äînow publisher and president of the foundation‚Äîalong with new executive editor Michael Pollan, redesigned Harper's and introduced the \\"Harper's Index\\" (statistics arranged for thoughtful effect), \\"Readings\\", and the \\"Annotation\\" departments to complement its fiction, essays, reportage, and reviews. As of the December 2019 issue, Julian Lucas writes the print edition's \\"New Books\\" column. Under the Lapham-MacArthur leadership, Harper's Magazine continued publishing literary fiction by John Updike, George Saunders, and others. Politically, Harper's was an especially vocal critic of U.S. domestic and foreign policies. Editor Lapham's monthly \\"Notebook\\" columns have lambasted the Clinton and the George W. Bush administrations. Since 2003, the magazine has concentrated on reportage about U.S. war in Iraq, with long articles about the battle for Fallujah, and the cronyism of the American reconstruction of Iraq. Other reporting has covered abortion issues, cloning, and global warming.An American Album: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Harper's Magazine, a 712-page illustrated anthology, with an introduction by Lewis H. Lapham and a foreword by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. In 2007, Harper's added the No Comment blog, by attorney Scott Horton, about legal controversies, Central Asian politics, and German studies. In April 2006, Harper's began publishing the Washington Babylon blog on its website,Harpers.org written by Washington Editor Ken Silverstein about American politics; and in 2008, Harper's added the Sentences blog, by contributing editor Wyatt Mason, about literature and belles lettres. Since that time these two blogs have ceased publication. Another website feature, composed by a rotating set of authors, is the \\"Weekly Review\\", single-sentence summaries of political, scientific, and bizarre news; like the \\"Harper's Index\\" and \\"Findings\\" in the print edition of the magazine, the \\"Weekly Review\\" items are arranged for ironic contrast. Controversies Editor Lewis H. Lapham was criticized for his reportage of the 2004 Republican National Convention, which had yet to occur, in his essay \\"Tentacles of Rage: The Republican Propaganda Mill, a Brief History\\", published in the September 2004 issue which implied that he had attended the convention. He apologized in a note.Shafer, Jack. \\"Lewis Lapham Phones It In: Figuring out what's wrong with Harper's magazine.\\" Slate 15 September 2004.Lapham, Lewis H. \\"Tentacles of rage: The Republican propaganda mill, a brief history.\\" Harper's September 2004. pp. 43‚Äì53. Lapham left two years later, after 28 years as Harper's editor in chief, and launched Lapham's Quarterly. The August 2004 issue contained a photo essay by noted photojournalist Peter Turnley, who had been hired to do a series of photo essays for the magazine. The eight-page spread in August 2004 showed images of death, grieving and funerals from both sides of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. On the U.S. side, Turnley visited the funeral of an Oklahoma National Guard member, Spc. Kyle Brinlee, 21, who was killed when his vehicle ran over an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. During his funeral, Turnley shot the open casket as it lay in the back of the high school auditorium where the funeral was held to accommodate 1,200 mourners, and this photo was used in the photo essay. Subsequently, the family sued the magazine in federal court. The case ended in 2007 when the U.S. Supreme Court, although saying the unauthorized publication was in \\"poor taste\\", upheld the ruling of the Tenth Circuit that the magazine had not violated the privacy rights of the family, as the family had invited the press, and thus \\"opened up the funeral scene to the public eye\\".Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press, Dismissal upheld in magazine's open-casket photo case, March 28, 2007. The March 2006 issue contained Celia Farber's article, \\"Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science\\", presenting Peter Duesberg's theory that HIV does not cause AIDS.

The Treatment Action Campaign, a South African organization working for greater popular access to HIV treatments, posted a response by eight researchers documenting more than fifty errors in the article. Lewis Lapham was succeeded as Harper's editor by Roger Hodge in 2006.Jaclyn Peiser, \\"Harper's Editor Insists He Was Fired Over Katie Roiphe Essay\\", The New York Times, April 18, 2018. Since that time, the magazine has had a number of shorter-termed editors in chief, several of whom were fired amid various controversies. On January 25, 2010, the firing of the magazine's editor, Roger Hodge, by publisher John R. MacArthur was met with criticism among the magazine's subscribers and staff. MacArthur initially claimed Hodge was stepping down for \\"personal reasons\\", but later disclosed that he fired Hodge. Ellen Rosenbush served from 2010 to 2015. She returned in January 2016, when MacArthur fired Christopher Cox, who had been named editor only three months prior in October 2015. James Marcus assumed the post of editor in 2016. In March 2018, an essay by Katie Roiphe on the #MeToo movement excited controversy both online and inside Harper's. Marcus had complained about the piece, suggesting the critique of #MeToo was inappropriate in light of Harper's \\"longtime reputation as a gentleman's smoking club\\"; he attributed this disagreement as a primary cause of his firing in 2018. In April 2018, Ellen Rosenbush assumed the title of editorial director. In October 2019, the magazine announced that novelist and essayist Christopher Beha would be taking over as editor, with Rosenbush remaining as editor-at-large. In July 2020, Harper's published an open letter called \\"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate\\" criticizing \\"illiberalism\\" and promoting a tolerance of different viewpoints. The letter received a mixed response on Twitter, with some remarking that the prominent signatories had \\"bigger platforms and more resources than most other humans\\" and were unlikely to face repercussions for anything they said, and others taking umbrage at particular signatories such as J. K. Rowling, who faced recent criticism for her comments on transgender issues. Notable contributors * Horatio Alger * Frederic H. Balfour * Wendell Berry * John Dickson Carr * John R.

Floorplan of the Chora Church, showing both inner and outer narthex. The narthex is an architectural element typical of early Christian and Byzantine basilicas and churches consisting of the entrance or lobby area, located at the west endBy convention, ecclesiastical floor plans are shown map-fashion, with north to the top and the liturgical east to the right. Therefore, some may refer to the narthex as being at the western end of the floor plan. This is done for symbolic reasons, as scriptures say to look for Christ appearing in the east, thus the location of the altar is known as the liturgical east, regardless of the actual cardinal directions. of the nave, opposite the church's main altar. Traditionally the narthex was a part of the church building, but was not considered part of the church proper. In early Christian churches the narthex was often divided into two distinct parts: an esonarthex (inner narthex) between the west wall and the body of the church proper, separated from the nave and aisles by a wall, arcade, colonnade, screen, or rail, and an external closed space, the exonarthex (outer narthex),In other languages a different terminology can arise confusion. For example, in Italian the inner narthex is called endonartece and the outer narthex esonartece, as the inner narthex in English. Krautheimer (1986), passim a court in front of the church facade delimited on all sides by a colonnade as in the first St. Peter's Basilica in Rome or in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. The exonarthex may have been either open or enclosed with a door leading to the outside, as in the Byzantine Chora Church. By extension, the narthex can also denote a covered porch or entrance to a building. Etymology The word comes from narthex (Medieval Latin from Classical Greek narthex ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∏Œ∑ŒæLSJ narthex \\"giant fennel, scourge\\") and was the place for penitents.The national encyclop√¶dia. ed. John H F. Brabner ‚Äì 1884 \\"This space was the narthex or \\" scourge,\\" and was for the use of penitents. The name was also extended to the outer court \\" In Modern Greek narthekas (ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ±œÇ) no longer has this meaning and is either the porch of a church, as English, or the brace of a sprained wrist or sling of a broken arm. In English the narthex is now the porch outside the church at the west end, formerly it was a part of the church itself.William George Clark Peloponnesus: notes of study and travel 1858 Page 110 \\"One of the most perplexing words in etymology and application is the word narthex. In modern times it can be applied to the porch outside the church at the west end; in old days it was given to a part of the church itself, ...\\" Purpose The purpose of the narthex was to allow those not eligible for admittance into the general congregation (particularly catechumens and penitents) to hear and partake of the service. The narthex would often include a baptismal font so that infants or adults could be baptized there before entering the nave, and to remind other believers of their baptisms as they gathered to worship. The narthex is thus traditionally a place of penitence, and in Eastern Christianity some penitential services, such as the Little Hours during Holy Week are celebrated there, rather than in the main body of the church. In the Russian Orthodox Church funerals are traditionally held in the narthex. Later reforms removed the requirement to exclude people from services who were not full members of the congregation, which in some traditions obviated the narthex. Church architects continued, however, to build a room before the entrance of the nave. This room could be called an inside vestibule (if it is architecturally part of the nave structure) or a porch (if it is a distinct, external structure). Some traditions still call this area the narthex as it represents the point of entry into the church, even if everyone is admitted to the nave itself. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the esonarthex and exonarthex had, and still have, distinct liturgical functions. For instance, the procession at the Paschal Vigil will end up at the exonarthex for the reading of the Resurrection Gospel, while certain penitential services are traditionally chanted in the esonarthex. In some Eastern Orthodox temples, the narthex will be referred to as the trapeza (refectory), because in ancient times, tables would be set up there after the Divine Liturgy for the faithful to eat a common meal, similar to the agape feast of the early church. To this day, this is where the faithful will bring their baskets at Pascha (Easter) for the priest to bless the Paschal foods which they will then take back to their homes for the festive break-fast. Traditionally, the narthex is where candles and prosphora will be sold for offering during Divine Services. The doorway leading from the narthex to the nave is sometimes referred to as the \\"Royal Doors\\",Sometimes the term \\"Royal Doors\\" is imprecisely applied to the Holy Doors. because in major cathedrals (catholica) there were several sets of doors leading into the nave, the central one being reserved only for the use of the Byzantine emperor.See ) On feast days there will be a procession to the narthex, followed by intercessory prayers, called the Litiy.

He was the editor of the American monthly Harper's Magazine from 1976 until 1981, and from 1983 until 2006.. He is the founder of Lapham's Quarterly, a quarterly publication about history and literature, and has written numerous books on politics and current affairs.  Personal life  A son of Lewis A. Lapham and Jane Foster, Lapham was born and grew up in San Francisco. His grandfather Roger Lapham was mayor of San Francisco, and his great grandfather, Lewis Henry Lapham, was a founder of Texaco. Through his grandfather, Lapham is a first cousin once removed of actor Christopher Lloyd, although they are three years apart in age. As a child, he attended the Hotchkiss School. Lapham was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge and Yale University, where he joined the literary society St. Anthony Hall. In 1972, Lapham married Joan Brooke Reeves, the daughter of Edward J. Reeves, a stockbroker and grocery heir, and Elizabeth M. Brooke (formerly the wife of Thomas Wilton Phipps, a nephew of Nancy Astor). They have three children: * Delphina (married Prince Don Bante Maria Boncompagni-Ludovisi). * Andrew (married Caroline Mulroney, only daughter of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney) * Winston  Harper's Magazine  Lewis Lapham served as editor of Harper's Magazine from 1976 to 2006 (with a hiatus from 1981 to 1983). He was managing editor from 1971 to 1975, after having worked for the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Herald Tribune. He is largely responsible for the modern look and prominence of the magazine, having introduced many of its signature features, including the \\"Harper's Index\\". He announced that he would become editor emeritus in spring 2006, continuing to write his Notebook column for the magazine as well as editing a new journal about history, Lapham's Quarterly. Lapham has also worked with the PEN American Center, sitting on the board of judges for the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award. In 2007, he was inducted into the American Society of Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame.. = Republican National Convention = Lapham wrote a September 2004 column for Harper's in which he included a brief account of the Republican National Convention as if he had witnessed it, \\"reflecting on the content and sharing with readers a question that occurred to him as he listened\\", as Jennifer Senior wrote in the New York Times Book Review. The magazine arrived in subscribers' mailboxes before the convention took place, as Senior says \\"forcing Lapham to admit that the scene was a fiction\\". The columnist apologized, \\"but pointed out political conventions are drearily scripted anyway ‚Äì he basically knew what was going to be said\\". Senior continues, \\"By this logic, though, I could have chosen not to read Pretensions to Empire before reviewing it, since I already knew Lapham's sensibility, just as he claims to know the Republicans.\\". Senior's reading of Pretensions to Empire was called into question by her claim that the convention essay was \\"conspicuously\\" missing, yet an edited version of the essay opens the book. The New York Times published a correction and Senior described her error as \\"an honest mistake\\"..  Works      His writing has appeared in The American Conservative. Life, Commentary, Vanity Fair, National Review, Yale Literary Magazine, ELLE, Fortune, Forbes, American Spectator, The New York Times, The Walrus, Maclean's, The Observer (London), and the Wall Street Journal. Lapham also served as a judge for the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award. Lapham is the host and author of the PBS series, America's Century and he was host of the weekly PBS series, Bookmark from 1989 to 1991. Lapham is currently the host of The World in Time: radio discussions with scholars and historians on Bloomberg Radio that open the doors of history behind the events in the news. Podcasts of the weekly talks are available at Bloomberg.com.. Lapham wrote The American Ruling Class (2005), a movie done in documentary style and featuring fictional characters and real people, i.e. Bill Bradley, Hodding Carter III and Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed, pondering the question \\"Is there a ruling class in America?\\", Lapham states at the movie's conclusion that \\"if you're not in, you're out\\". The movie aired on the Sundance Channel, July 30, 2007. =Articles= * Awards * 1978 Gerald Loeb Award for Magazines  References   External links  * Lapham's Quarterly ** Essays by Lewis H.

Ferneyhough is typically considered to be the central figure of the New Complexity movement. Ferneyhough has taught composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg and the University of California, San Diego; he currently teaches at Stanford University and is a regular lecturer in the summer courses at Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse. Life Ferneyhough was born in Coventry and received formal musical training at the Birmingham School of Music and the Royal Academy of Music from 1966‚Äì67, where he studied with Lennox Berkeley. Ferneyhough was awarded the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1968 and moved to mainland Europe to study with Ton de Leeuw in Amsterdam, and later with Klaus Huber in Basel. Between 1973 and 1986 he taught composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg, Germany.Richard Toop, \\"Ferneyhough, Brian\\", Grove Music Online (Updated 22 Oct 2008), edited by Deane Root (accessed 9 September 2012). The Royan Festival of 1974 saw the premiere of Cassandra's Dream Song, the first of several pieces for solo flute, as well as Missa Brevis, written for 12 singers. In 1975, performances of his work for large ensemble Transit and Time and Motion Study III were given; the former piece being awarded a Koussevitzky prize, the latter performed at the Donaueschingen festival. In many of these events he was paired with fellow British composer, Michael Finnissy, with whom he became friends during his student days.Michael Finnissy, \\"Biography\\", Official Michael Finnissy website. Retrieved on 17 February 2009. In 1984 he was given the title Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Between 1987 and 1999 he was Professor of Music at the University of California, San Diego. His graduate students at UCSD included composers Chaya Czernowin and Mark Applebaum, among many others. In 2000, he became William H. Bonsall Professor in Music at Stanford University. For the 2007‚Äì08 academic year, he was Visiting Professor at the Harvard University Department of Music. Between 1978 and 1994 Ferneyhough was a composition lecturer at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse and, since 1990, has directed an annual mastercourse at the Fondation Royaumont in France. For example, he had Toshio Hosokawa, Jo√´l-Fran√ßois Durand, Roger Redgate, Alessandro Melchiorre,Giulio Castagnoli, Kaija Saariaho as students. In 2007, Ferneyhough received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize for lifetime achievement.Composer Brian Ferneyhough wins 2007 Siemens Music Prize In 2009 he was appointed foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary DMus from Goldsmiths, University of London. In December 2018 he received an honorary degree from the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire for his contribution to contemporary classical music.https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/classical_music/brian-ferneyhough-receive- honorary-doctorate-royal-birmingham-conservatoire/ Style and technique Ferneyhough's initial forays into composition were met with little sympathy in England. His submission of Coloratura to the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) in 1966 was returned, with a suggestion that the oboe part should be scored for clarinet. Whilst Ferneyhough did find it hard, one source of support came from Hans Swarsenski who saw the same thing happen to Cornelius Cardew; Cardew enjoyed a prestigious continental reputation, but a poor one in his homeland. Swarsenski said of Ferneyhough: 'I've taken on an English composer who is I think is enormously talented. If this doesn't work, this is the last time'. Ferneyhough continued to struggle, but the aforementioned Royan festival marked a breakthrough for Ferneyhough's career.Toop 2002, p. 139 From here, Ferneyhough became closely associated with the so-called New Complexity school of composition (indeed, he is often referred to as the \\"Father of New Complexity\\"), characterized by its extension of the modernist tendency towards formalization (particularly as in integral serialism). Ferneyhough's actual compositional approach, however, rejects serialism and other \\"generative\\" methods of composing; he prefers instead to use systems only to create material and formal constraints, while their realisation appears to be more spontaneous.Richard Toop, \\"Ferneyhough, Brian\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (accessed 21 April 2008). Ferneyhough has been interested in challenging listeners‚Äô ways of absorbing musical information flow, prompting new kinds of temporal awareness by being presented with musical materials (events, objects, gestures, rhythms, textures) that contain their own sufficient complexity: > The more the internal integrity of a musical event suggests its autonomy, > the less the capacity of the \\"time arrow\\" to traverse it with impunity; it > is \\"bent\\" by the contact. By the same token, however, the impact of the time > vector \\"damages\\" the even-object, thus forcing it to reveal its own > generative history, the texturation of its successivity: its perception > potential has been redefined by the collision. As the piece progresses we > are continually stumbling across further stages in this catastrophic > obstacle race. The energy accumulation and expenditure across and between > these confrontational moments is perceived as a form of internalized > metronome, and in fact it is a version of this procedure which most clearly > fields the expressive world of Mnemosyne: the retardation and catastrophic > timeline modifiers are employed equally to focus temporal awareness through > the lens of material.Brian Ferneyhough, Collected Writings, eds. Boros and > Toop (London: Routledge, 1995): 45. His scores make huge technical demands on performers. The compositions have, however, attracted a number of advocates, among them the Arditti Quartet, ELISION Ensemble, the members of the Nieuw Ensemble, Ensemble Contrechamps, Ensemble Expos√©, Armand Angster, James Avery, , Arne DeForce, Mats Scheidegger, , Nicolas Hodges, Mark Knoop, Geoffrey Morris, Ian Pace, Carl Rosman, Harry Sparnaay, and EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble. His opera, Shadowtime, with a libretto by Charles Bernstein, and based on the life of the German philosopher Walter Benjamin, was premiered in Munich on 25 May 2004, and recorded in 2005 for CD release in 2006. As is usual for Ferneyhough's works, the opera received mixed reviews.Andrew Clements, \\"Friday Review: Opera of the Phantom: Brian Ferneyhough Is the Last Composer You'd Expect to Produce a Stage Work, but the Life‚Äîand death, and afterlife‚Äîof the Philosopher Walter Benjamin Inspired Him to Write an Opera Like No Other\\", The Guardian (8 July 2005):11.Richard Whitehouse, \\"Shadowtime\\", Classical Source (accessed 19 June 2011).Gavin Dixon, \\"Ferneyhough ‚Äì Chamber works\\", Musicweb-International.com (accessed 18 June 2011).

Its capital is Jolo on the island of the same name. Maimbung, the royal capital of the Sultanate of Sulu, is also located in the province. Sulu is along the southern border of the Sulu Sea and the northern boundary of the Celebes Sea. History =Pre-Spanish and Spanish eras= Prior to the arrival of Islam in Sulu, the province used to adhere to local animist religions; this later changed to Hindu and Buddhist belief systems. Throughout this time, the Kingdom of Lupah Sug had been established centuries before Islam arrived. The advent of Islam around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast Asia. The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to Sulu and Mindanao in the 12th century. Painting of Sulu home & coconut plantation A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu. Year 1380 CE, Karim- ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines. Year 1450 CE, a Johore-born Arab adventurer, Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali, eventually marrying his daughter Dayang-dayang Paramisuli and eventually inheriting Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before) and turning it into a sultanate. Sayyid Abubakar eventually inherited the rule of Rajah Baguinda, established the Sultanate of Sulu and became its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan and Basilan under its aegis. The navigational error that landed Ferdinand Magellan in Limasawa brought awareness of Europe to the Philippines and opened the door to Spanish colonial incursion. The Spaniards introduced Catholicism and a political system of church-state dichotomy, which encountered fierce resistance in the devastating Moro wars from 1578 to 1899. The Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements, until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. =American and Japanese eras= After Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, American forces came to Jolo and ended the 23 years of Spanish military occupation (1876 to 1899). On August 20, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and Brig. Gen. John C. Bates signed the Bates Agreement that continued the gradual emasculation of the Sultanate started by Spain (Treaty of 1878) until March 1915 when the Sultan abdicated his temporal powers in the Carpenter Agreement. The Agreement eliminated opposition to the civilian government of Gov. Clinton Solidum. Sulu in 1918, which covered the current province of Tawi-Tawi The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920 by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began. Sulu, however, had an appointed American governor until 1935 and the Governor General in Manila had a say in Sulu affairs. At any rate, the essence of local governance forged by Rajah Baguinda continued to permeate the ethos of Sulu politics despite centuries of colonial presence. History points to a local government in Sulu that antedates other similar systems in the country. The province hosted the Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) which was the royal palace of the Sultan of Sulu since historical times. The palace, located in Maimbung was made of wood, and was destroyed in 1932 by a huge storm. During the brief Japanese occupation years, Sulu was bombed by the Japanese and was conquered afterwards. The Japanese were eventually expelled by the Americans and the natives of Sulu, and the Americans started to push for the independence of the Philippines as 'one country'. This prompted various leaders from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to campaign against being lumped with the Catholic natives of Luzon and the Visayas. Despite the campaign against the 'one Philippines model', the United States granted independence to the Philippines, effectively giving control of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to the Filipino government in Manila. Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) in Maimbung before it was destroyed by a typhoon. The palace was the seat of the Sultanate of Sulu's reigning monarch for generations. =Postwar era= At the beginning of Philippine independence era, the reconstruction of the Daru Jambangan continued to be of huge importance to the people of Sulu as only a few arches and posts remain from the once grand palace complex. Many members of the royal family advocated for the reconstruction of the palace, however, the government of the Philippines made no official position or fund for the matter. During that time, the Mindanao sentiment to become a free country on its own was also felt in Sulu. In 1973, the municipalities of South Ubian, Tandubas, Simunul, Sitangkai, Balimbing (Panglima Sugala), Bungao, Cagayan de Sulu (Mapun), and Tutle Island were transferred from the jurisdiction of Sulu to the newly formed province of Tawi-Tawi pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 302 of September 11, 1973. =The Marcos dictatorship= During Marcos era, Sulu was one of the provinces that fought back against Ferdinand Marcos as hundreds of Moros were tortured, killed, and exterminated during the era. When news broke out regarding the planned invasion of eastern Sabah, Marcos ordered the military to massacre Tausug warriors, which led to the brutal Jabidah massacre, the worst human rights violation against the natives of Sulu. The Sultan of Sulu, members of the royal family, and the leaders of Sulu were in favor of the People Power Revolution in Manila that successfully toppled the dictatorship and restored democracy in the country. =Autonomy and recent history= In 1989, the province of Sulu became part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or ARMM. A peace pact between the Moro National Liberation Front or MNLF and the Philippine government was also made. The founder and leader of the MNLF, Nur Misuari, who was a native of Sulu and adhered to the Sultanate of Sulu, became the governor of the entire ARMM from 1996 to 2001. In 2016, a small replica of Daru Jambangan was built in the neighboring town of Talipao and became a centerpiece for a 'vacation park'. The replica was about 25% of the actual size of the real Daru Jambangan during its heyday. A campaign to restore the Daru Jambangan in its original location in Maimbung is still ongoing. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the National Museum of the Philippines were tasked to faithfully restore or reconstruct the Daru Jambangan in Maimbung. Geography Jolo and its adjacent islets seen from space The province covers an area of . Sulu's main island, Jolo, has an area of , making it the 16th largest island of the Philippine Archipelago by area. Sulu is a part of the Sulu Archipelago, which stretches from the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula on the north to the island of Borneo in the south. The main island and its islets are situated between the island-provinces of Basilan to the northeast, and Tawi-Tawi to the southwest. Sulu is bordered by two seas; the Sulu Sea to the north, and the Celebes Sea to its south. Sulu has over 157 islets, some of which remain unnamed. The islands are organized into four groups: * Jolo group * Pangutaran group * Tongkil-Banguingui (Samales) group * Siasi-Tapul group =Administrative divisions= Sulu comprises 19 municipalities, organized into two legislative districts and further subdivided into 410 barangays. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" !

Although consisting of a mixed community of Muslims, the Tausugs dominate the Sulu Archipelago. The Tausug were among the first inhabitants of the Philippines to embrace Islam as a religion and a way of life. They are referred to as ‚Äòpeople of the current‚Äô, reflective of their close ties to the sea. The Tausug language is the lingua franca of Sulu. The other local language is the indigenous Sama, which is widely used in varied tones and accents. This variety led to the development of Sinama dialects. The major ones are Sinama Sibutu (spoken mainly in the Sibutu-Sitangkai Region), Sinama Simunul (concentrated in Simunul-Manuk-Mangkaw Islands), Sinama Kapoan (spoken in the South Ubian-Tandubas and Sapa-Sapa Regions) and Sinama Banguingui (concentrated in Buan Island and spoken by Banguingui people). The Bajau-Sama language is also spoken, as are the official languages of Tagalog (Filipino) and English. Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay, while Chavacano is also spoken by Christian and Muslim locals who maintain contacts and trade with the mainland Zamboanga Peninsula and Basilan. Many Muslims can also speak Cebuano because of the mass influx of Cebuano settlers to Mindanao, especially among the Tau S≈´g since Tausug is a related Visayan language. =Religion= Tulay Mosque in Jolo Sulu inhabitants are predominantly Muslim, constituting about 99% of the provincial population in 2015. A majority of Sulu's Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th century onwards. Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a \\"purer\\" Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam. Majority of Sulu Christians are Roman Catholics, they are under the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs. =Languages= Government Governors after People Power Revolution 1986: Vice Governors after People Power Revolution 1986: Economy Sulu is predominantly agricultural with farming and fishing as its main livelihood activities. Its fertile soil and ideal climate can grow a variety of crops such as abaca, coconuts, Sulu coffee, oranges, and lanzones as well as exotic fruits seldom found elsewhere in the country such as durian and mangosteen. Fishing is the most important industry since the Sulu Sea is one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. The province also have an extensive pearl industry. Pearls are extensively gathered and a pearl farm is established at Marungas Island. The backs of sea turtles are made into beautiful trays and combs. During breaks from fishing, the people build boats and weave mats. Other industries include coffee processing and fruit preservation. The handicrafts of Sulu have both Islamic and Malay influences. Skilled artisans make boats, bladed weapons, bronze and brassware, pis cloth, embroidered textiles, shellcraft, traditional house carvings, and carved wooden grave markers. The province used to be one of the most prosperous in southern Philippines, however, due to conflicts, terrorism, and the establishment of jihadists groups such as the Abu Sayyaf, the province's economy has suffered badly and has been reduced to its current state.

The capital of Tawi-Tawi is Bongao. It is the southernmost province of the country, sharing sea borders with the Malaysian state of Sabah and the Indonesian North Kalimantan province, both on the island of Borneo to the west. To the northeast lies the province of Sulu. Tawi-Tawi also covers some islands in the Sulu Sea to the northwest, Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi Island and the Turtle Islands, just away from Sabah. The municipalities comprising the current Tawi-Tawi province were formerly under the jurisdiction of Sulu until 1973.  Etymology  Province was named after its main island. Tawi-Tawi is the Sinama form of jawi-jawi, Malay for \\"banyan tree;\\" the island is known for having an abundance of this tree. Early Spanish accounts give the name of the island as Tauitaui, Tavi- Tavi or Tavitavi.  History  Evidence of human presence in Tawi-tawi was carbon-dated to be 6,810 BC to 3,190 BC, signifying one of the earliest known evidence of human presence in Southeast Asia. The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.http://www.ironwulf.net/2009/03/19/tawi-tawi- balobok-rock-shelter/ Much of the Tawi-tawi area was the center of Sama culture and arts for hundreds of years. Some islands are sites of centuries- old traditional burial grounds featuring traditional Sama okil carvings of ancestors. In 1380, the first mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque, was established by an Arab trader and missionary, Makhdum Karim. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the Sultanate of Sulu in nearby Sulu province was founded. Although unlike the Tausug people, many Sama retained at least part of their ancient animist religions. As early as January 28, 1761, Sultan Muizz ud-Din entered into an agreement with Alexander Dalrymple of the British East India Company for commercial and economic concessions. The subsequent treaties with Muizz ud-Din on September 12, 1762 and with Sultan Azim ud-Din, claimant to the Sultanate and a prisoner of the British in Manila, on February 23, 1763, confirmed these British claims. However, on March 5, 1775, Datu Teteng annihilated the British troops in Balambangan. Since then, the Muslims not only fought the British soldiers but also the Spanish troops. After the brother of Sultan Aliyud-Din I captured the Spanish ship San Jose in Tawi-Tawi, the British forces withdrew from Balambangan in 1805. On January 28, 1878, Baron von Overbeck, representing the British North Borneo Company, signed a treaty with Sultan Jamalul Alam for the lease of the Sultan's land in Borneo at an annual rent of 5,000 Mexican dollars. The Germans also asked for commercial concessions. Due to foreign encroachments, the Spaniards constructed a naval base at Tata'an and built garrisons in Bongao and Siasi. On March 7, 1885, Spain, Britain and Germany signed a protocol in Madrid whereby Spain relinquished all her claims to the offshore lands in Borneo, granted freedom of trade and navigation in Sulu, and Britain and Germany recognized Spanish sovereignty over Balabac and Cagayan de Sulu. However, the British diplomatically continued to pay the annual rents for Sabah (Sultan's land in Borneo) to Harun ar-Rashid. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the mutiny of the 68th Regiment at Busbus, Jolo implicated Tagalog soldiers. The Muslims, however, retained their own views on independence and freedom. When the American forces occupied Jolo on May 19, 1899, they established garrisons at Bongao and Siasi after the Muslims wiped out the Spanish garrison in Tata'an, Tawi-Tawi. In 1900, the United States entered into a treaty with Spain whereby Sibutu and Cagayan de Sulu were ceded to the former for $100,000. The Sultanate continued to receive the rentals for Sabah until 1946 when the British North Borneo Company sold its rights to the British Crown. During World War II, the calm but exposed waters around the islands were used by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a major fleet anchorage due to its proximity to the oilfields of Borneo. Japanese forces however did not develop any facilities on the islands leaving the anchorage without an airfield, which allowed American submarines to track the movements of the Japanese fleet at the exposed anchorage. After the Japanese Imperial Forces occupied Tawi-Tawi, guerilla forces were organized under Lts. Konglamtio and Alejandro Tresperes in Siasi and Tawi-Tawi. These units were under the Sulu Command led by Lt. Col. Alejandro Suarez. The Command aided the American Liberation Forces at Sanga-Sanga Island on April 2, 1945. On October 16, 1947, the offshore lands of Borneo‚ÄîTaganak, Bakkungan, Bayaua, Sibauang and Lihiman Islands‚Äîwere turned over to the Philippines by the British North Borneo government. The unveiling ceremonies of the marker in Taganak Island on June 26, 1948 were attended by M.G. Combe, representing Great Britain, former President Diosdado Macapagal for the Philippines, Princess Tarhata Kiram for the Sultanate, and Governor Kalinangan Calauag for Sulu. = Creation of Tawi- Tawi Province = Previously part of the province of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi was converted into a province on September 11, 1973 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 302 and erstwhile Commodore Romulo Espaldon was appointed as its first governor until the first provincial elections were held. Prior to issuing the decree, President Marcos had asked Espaldon, ‚ÄúWhy are the young boys of Tawi-Tawi easily wooed by the Moro National Liberation Front?‚Äù Espaldon replied, ‚ÄúThe Sama boys, like their elders and leaders, are tired and weary of their union with the Province of Sulu. They want to have their own leaders and manage their own affairs. If His Excellency wants to solve the problem, I recommend that he create them into a separate province and allow them to exercise their own local prerogatives.‚Äù Hence, Espaldon earned the moniker \\"Father of Tawi-Tawi.\\" During the first 730 days of Tawi-Tawi as a province, Espaldon spearheaded over 100 civilian infrastructure projects, including the construction of the provincial capitol, provincial hospital, public market, 50 mosques, school houses, radio station, airstrips, piers, houses, bridges, roads and water system. The seat of the provincial government was initially designated as Bato-Bato in the municipality of Balimbing (now Panglima Sugala), but was moved to Bongao on April 4, 1979 by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 24. Geography Bud Bongao, a mountain-forest and sacred mountain of Tawi-Tawi The province lies at the southwestern tip of the country, situated between the Sulu Sea in the north and the Celebes Sea in the south. The province is part of the Sulu Archipelago, and consists of Tawitawi Island and 106 surrounding islands and islets with a combined land area of . Tawitawi Island itself has an area of . The last island of the province at the edge of the Philippine-Malaysia border is Panguan Island. The province has two seasons: dry and wet. The climate is generally moderate. The wettest months are from August to November. The other months of the year are generally dry with occasional rain showers. =Biogeography= The main island of Tawi-Tawi supports many endemic species and subspecies of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants unique to this island, plus some that are only shared with Sulu Province. These include the Tawitawi brown dove, the Sulu hornbill and the Sulu bleeding-heart, although this latter species may already be extinct. The rapid expansion of human settlements into forested areas together with clearance for agriculture in the last few decades has dramatically reduced the available habitat for most of the endemic species, many of which are now considered 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. =Administrative divisions= alt=Political Map of Tawi-Tawi Tawi-Tawi comprises 11 municipalities, all encompassed by two legislative districts and further subdivided into 203 barangays. * Bongao ‚Äî the capital of the province * Languyan ‚Äî created by President Marcos for rebel leader Hadjiril Matba who joined the government in the 1970s * Mapun ‚Äî Tawi- Tawi's northernmost municipality, formerly Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi or Cagayan de Sulu * Panglima Sugala ‚Äî formerly known as Balimbing. However, in the EDSA Revolution, the word \\"balimbing\\" acquired a derogatory meaning associated with turncoatism due to the fruit's many sides. It is the former capital of the province. * Sapa-Sapa * Sibutu ‚Äî home to the descendants of Malay royalty in Borneo and not necessarily associated with the Sulu royalty * Simunul ‚Äî site of oldest mosque in the Philippines and home of Sheikh Makdum, one of the early pioneers spreading Islam in the country * Sitangkai ‚Äî southernmost municipality in the country. * South Ubian * Tandubas * Turtle Islands ‚Äî a turtle sanctuary and protected area Most of the municipalities are located on the islands in the Sulu Archipelago.

The Jama Mapun are largely found in the Cagayan Mapun and Turtle Island Group. Many of the people from the Turtle Islands and Cagayan Mapun maintain daily commerce with Sabah, since it is only 14 kilometers away. The Badjao (also called \\"Sama Dilaut\\") are widely dispersed across the province, though their population is diminishing due to diseases and migration to other areas in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Many locals and barter traders can also speak Sabah Malay. =Religion= Almost all (99%) of the population of Tawi-Tawi is Muslim, with a minority of Christians (0.7%). A majority of Tawi-Tawi's Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th century onwards. The oldest mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makdum Mosque, can be found in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi. Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a \\"purer\\" Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam. Majority of Tawi-Tawi Christians are Roman Catholic, they are under the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo/Diocese of Jolo. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs. Economy Agriculture, fishing, and agar-agar (seaweeds) farming are the leading source of livelihood of the people of Tawi-Tawi, with quite a number engaged in the barter trade business. Copra is the top agricultural product, followed by root crops, fruits, and vegetables. Transportation Sanga-Sanga Airport, the main airport of the province, is located in the municipality of Bongao. Cebu Pacific began operating a daily flight from Zamboanga City to Tawi-Tawi Province on October 14, 2011, utilizing its 150-seater Airbus A319 aircraft. Philippine Airlines (operated by PAL Express) also started operating flights to and from Zamboanga City on December 15, 2019. A sea connection to other parts of the Philippine archipelago as well as an international route to Semporna, Malaysia is available from Bongao.

Gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as Norns, teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other species, and breeding them. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey. A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs. The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures. Rather than taking a scripted approach, Creatures series games were driven by detailed biological and neurological simulation and their unexpected results. There were six major Creatures releases from Creature Labs. Between 1996 and 2001, there were three principal games released, the Docking Station add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games, and there were three games created for console systems. A sequel named Creatures Online was in development, with the artificial life technology from Creatures 3 and Docking Station updated to a 3D environment. Overview The program was one of the first commercial titles to code alife organisms from the genetic level upwards using a sophisticated biochemistry and neural network brains, including simulated senses of sight, hearing and touch. This meant that the Norns and their DNA could develop and \\"evolve\\" in increasingly diverse ways, unpredicted by the makers. By breeding certain Norns with others, some traits could be passed on to following generations. The Norns turned out to behave similarly to living creatures. Sight is simulated by having a group of neurons representing each type of object in the world. When an object belonging to this type is in front of the creature ('within eyesight'), the neuron becomes active and the creature can 'see' the object. The Norns possess simulated biological drives which give punishment when they are raised, and reward when they are lowered. The model for Norns' decision-making process is Behaviorist and based on Norns learning how to reduce their drives. Dickinson and Balleine state that while this stimulus-response/reinforcement process makes the creatures seem like they are goal-directed, they are instead 'habit machines' responding in a learned fashion to particular stimuli. Mutations in the genome also occur, allowing new characteristics to appear in the population and potentially be inherited by a future generation. Because the Norns have a lifespan of roughly 40 hours, users could observe the changes that occur over a large number of generations. Faulty genomes can also occur - for example, Norns which cannot see or hear, or immortal Norns due to a hyper-efficient digestion system. Creatures used the emergent approach seen in animats, but with the goal of more complex behaviours than locomotion. Grand describes the psychological model of the creatures as being inspired by rats. In 2000, Steve Grand described the intelligence level of Norns as being like ants. Margaret Boden, in 2003, rejected Creatures as being a form of alien life as the simulated metabolism is concerned with controlling the Norn's behaviour, not on maintaining its 'physical' form. In 2011, Steve Grand stated that while the Norns in Creatures could learn, generalise from past experiences to novel experiences, and react in an intelligent manner to stimuli, they could not think. The genetics in Creatures are somewhat different from human genetics; they are haploid. There is no concept of dominant gene and recessive gene, much less recombination between loci. Nevertheless, the complexity of the simulated biochemistry meant that Norn behaviour was highly unpredictable. Among the fans of Creatures were the Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins, who called it a \\"quantum leap in the development of artificial life\\", and author Douglas Adams. Creatures inspired some players to take up careers in the sciences. History Originally conceived as a desktop pet with a brain, Grand later incorporated inspiration from The Planiverse to pitch a \\"little computer ewoks\\" game, like the game Little Computer People. Grand wanted players to have a rapport with their creatures, feeling that he should make the creatures seem \\"genuinely alive\\" to the player, showing \\"the 'right' kind of behaviour' in a variety of circumstances. To create this kind of behaviour, Grand felt it was necessary to program the creatures by simulating the building blocks of nature in a bottom-up approach, allowing the complex behaviour to emerge, rather than using a rule-based system approach. Grand later wished to include references to an \\"English\\" or Norse mythology, to try to make the world more internally consistent, but found that the team wanted to make the game into a conventional adventure game. He later decided to scale back on the mythology aspects of the game, focusing instead on the artificial life point - eventually presenting the game as an artificial pet hobby, which provided some of the impetus to include genetics in the creatures. Creatures was developed as a consumer product by Millennium, and was released by Mindscape in 1996. The program was instantly successful, and an online community of players soon formed, swapping Norns, creating new objects for Albia, sharing tips on how to play the game and anecdotes about unexpected evolutionary changes that they had seen, and even creating new breeds of Norn. At one point, the Creatures online community was the largest of its type. In 1996, Creatures won an EMMA Award. Based on sales of 500,000 copies of Creatures from 1996 through to the second quarter of 1998, it was estimated that at that time, there was a possible global population of up to five million norns. Development of Creatures 2 began in Q3 1997. In 1998, the video games division of Millennium was sold to Sony Entertainment while those working on alife and Creatures formed a new company called Cyberlife Technology. Along with continued work on the Creatures titles, the company did work for industry and the British Ministry of Defence, famously attempting to teach live organisms to fly virtual fighter jets. Creatures 2 was nominated in the Artificial Intelligence category of the Game Developers Conference's Spotlight Award. In the late 1990s, Grand left Cyberlife to form Cyberlife Research and focus on the production of new alife technologies, including work on a robotic life form he called Lucy as well as writing books about his research. The remainder of the company was renamed Creature Labs, and focused on video game development. Sequels to Creatures, including Creatures 2, Creatures 3 and the small-children's games Creatures Adventures and Creatures Playground, were released by Creature Labs in subsequent years. Creatures Adventures won an EMMA Award in 2000. Creatures Playground was exhibited at E3 and nominated for a BAFTA award in 2000. The final major Creatures release, Docking Station, was made available for download from the company's web site in 2001. Development was suspended on future Creatures games on March 20, 2003, when Creature Labs ceased operations, but development and trademark rights have since been purchased by Gameware Development, Ltd. Gameware has revived the Creatures Developer Network, the shop, the forums, the Docking Station server, and has released many before-purchasable tools and add-ons for free. Gameware staff that previously worked on Creatures developed a convergent media game for the BBC called BAMZOOKi. In 2004, the Creatures games have been re-released in combination packs under the names Creatures: The Albian Years (C1, C2), Creatures Exodus (C3, DS) and Creatures Village (CA, CP). The Albian Years, and Exodus include the separate games, whereas Village has merged Adventures and Playground into a single game. Kutoka Interactive, a Canadian children's software company, has created releases of Creatures Exodus (Kutoka) and Creatures Village (Kutoka Kids) that are compatible with both Apple's Mac OS X and Windows XP. They were released on 30 September 2005, and can be purchased either directly from Kutoka or from other online stores. In November 2009, GOG.com announced that they were offering Creatures: The Albian Years, Creatures Exodus and Creatures Village for sale on their site as digital downloads. In 2011, Creatures 3: Raised in Space, a PlayStation One game, was re-released on the PlayStation Plus service. In 2011, Fishing Cactus announced they were developing Creatures 4, to be demonstrated at that year's gamescom. A second demonstration was exhibited at gamescom 2012. Creatures 4 is Fishing Cactus's most complex game to date. Creatures 4 appeared at the 2012 Paris Games Week. In May 2013, Fishing Cactus announced that they and BigBen were partnering with ProSiebenSat.1 Games as a distributor, and that the name of the game would be changed from Creatures 4 to Creatures Online. Another demo was shown at gamescom 2013. Julien Hamaide, a developer of Creatures Online, presented about it at the Game/AI Conference 2014. In September 2015, Fishing Cactus halted the development of Creatures Online. In 2016, Spil Games announced that they had bought the Creatures intellectual property from BigBen and were developing a free-to-play mobile game called Creatures Family to be released in 2017. Gameplay Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey. The player cannot force creatures to do anything. The player is represented by a disembodied hand in the world, and the hand can attempt to teach creatures by tickling them as a reward or punishing creatures by slapping them. (For Creatures Village, aimed at very young players, tickling is done by a feather wand, and punishment is represented by a squirt bottle.) Older norns can also teach concepts to younger norns. Norns may also express to the player how they are feeling. The language aspect was incorporated to promote a relationship between norns and players, allowing players to anthropomorphise their creatures. A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs. Breeding is depicted in the game as \\"a delicate affair\\", and is shown in the game by \\"a long kissing sound followed by a pop\\". The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures. Death has real consequences - the individual norns do not return after they die. All creatures are bipedal, but there are some variant appearances that are genetically-linked. Some alternate play styles include \\"wolfling runs\\", where the player may not intervene in their creatures' lives, or even norn torture. Trying to selectively breed or engineer certain traits into the population is also popular, for example, coloured creatures, norns with a better immune system, or a less-aggressive grendel. =Species= ;Norns A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program. Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients. Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns. Reviewers have compared the Norns' visual design to the Mogwai of the Gremlins film series. The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of valet and pet. According to the Creatures Labs website, they spread across the galaxy through the Warp and evolved into various variations, including but not restricted to: Toxic Norn, Treehugger Norn and Magma Norns. The spread of Norns throughout the galaxy is related to the mysterious disappearance of the Shee from Albia (from the point of view of the Norns). It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet. In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and neural network to serve as a brain. From Creatures 2 onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics; mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced. Norns are very social animals, sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat. ;Shee The statue of a Shee in Creatures 2. This is one of very few official in-game appearances of the Shee. (There are more hidden deeper in the game.) The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels. The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise. Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own DNA and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel. Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a \\"more spherical world\\". They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used \\"Bioenergy\\" (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions. Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators. ;Ettins Ettins are a species in Creatures 2 and Creatures 3. Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home. C2 Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown. Ettins were introduced into the Creatures series in C2, having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption. An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant \\"small, lizard-like creatures\\", who were often kept as pets by Norns. The Ettins in Creatures 2 were infertile; however, in Creatures 3, there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin. An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in Creatures 2 revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar. ;Grendels Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns. The early concepts of their appearance described them as \\"resembling a huge, titanium spider\\". In the unmodified Creatures 1 and 2, Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In Creatures 3, two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel. In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a \\"Mother\\" machine; in Creatures 3, however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the airlock) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the piranha pool) so that they cannot hatch. The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement. It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a 'Grenorn'. The Creatures community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a \\"Grendel Liberation Front\\" - despite being intended to add stress to Norns' lives, players began to tame their Grendels. =User Interface= In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player's mouse in the main visual area of the game. In Creatures and Creatures 2, players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns. Creatures 2 introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit. In Creature 3 and Docking Station, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in Creatures and Creatures 2, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings. Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as \\"terrifying\\", and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns. Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is \\"limited to seeing areas that you've tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns,\\" and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures. Creatures 2 introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature. Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing Creatures, disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system \\"highly user friendly.\\" He noted also that there was only one way that the player could save, when the player exited the game. Eddie Walou praised the simplified user interface of Creatures 4, saying that earlier games felt like you had to have your BAC to understand. Kahn Lusth, writing for Canard PC, enjoyed the new interface of Creatures Online for communicating with creatures, where with a click of the mouse the player can choose suggestions to guide their creatures, describing it as more convenient than typing keywords. To improve the ergonomics on the iOS system, a 'rubber-band' system has been created for Creatures Online, where the player draws a line between the norn and an object. When the finger is lifted, the available instructions appear. =Environment= While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, Windows Media Player, as the game developed, the need for a self- contained world became more apparent. The world was named \\"Albia\\", after Albion, and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia. Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, \\"messy\\", world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures' personalities to emerge. The backdrop for Creatures was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world, part of which is now housed at The Centre for Computing History.Creatures Model - Computing History The world is rendered in 2.5D, and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature. The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways. Objects are written using an object-oriented programming technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects. Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects. The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly modifiable. Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns. In Creatures 2, the environment became more complex, with a \\"Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very \\"real\\" feeling world that adapts around the player.\\" In Creatures 3 and Docking Station, the game was set on a spaceship. The environment became more segmented into areas called \\"metarooms\\", small biomes, each with their own ecosystem. Players could download and add new metarooms to their games. Games in the series There were six major Creatures releases from Creature Labs. In addition to the three principal games, the Docking Station add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games were released. =On Albia (later re-released as Creatures: The Albian Years)= Creatures The original Creatures game, released in the United Kingdom and Australia in November 1996 and in North America in July 1997, took place on the fictional disc-shaped world Albia. While the \\"faces\\" of the disc were uninhabitable, the \\"rim\\" of Albia was home to a complicated environment much like Earth's. Here lay an abandoned system of laboratories left over by the Shee, an advanced race that had suddenly left the planet many years earlier in order to find a more stable world. In these laboratories and environments, the player was able to hatch new Norns from leftover eggs and re-inhabit the world of Albia. According to Millenium, every copy of Creatures contains a unique starting set of eggs, whose genomes are not replicated on any other copy of the game. An expansion pack, called \\"Life Kit #1\\" was released for purchase later. Creatures 2 Creatures 2 added 16-bit graphics and a larger world Creatures 2, released on September 30, 1998, took place many years after the first game, after a devastating natural disaster (or, as explained in later games, a devastating Shee disaster) had changed the landscape of Albia dramatically and opened up new areas of the world. New technology and species were made available to the player, and the creatures themselves had been provided with \\"considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics\\". Despite the great change in environment, including a \\"complete working eco-system\\", the focus of the game remained the same. Creatures 2 Deluxe (with Life Kit) soon followed. 200,000 copies of Creatures 2 were immediately shipped upon its release. Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2. Creatures 2 was considered \\"much more difficult\\" than C1, and the new, more challenging environment and norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter. Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a \\"labour of love\\", noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns' lives. Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for Creatures 2 for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a \\"funeral dirge\\" as the body left the screen. =After leaving Albia (later re-released as Creatures Exodus)= Creatures 3 Creatures 3, released on November 4, 1999, took a detour from the first two games. It took place on the spaceship that the Shee had used to flee Albia. The ship was divided into many carefully controlled environments (Norn Terrarium, Jungle Terrarium, Desert Terrarium, Marine Terrarium). Creatures 3 was much more technologically focused, including many agents which could be connected in various ways to perform tasks. Still, the goal was to experiment with the three principal species and create a living world out of an empty ship. Creatures 3 included a \\"new social element\\", by which norns could remember relationships they've formed with other creatures better. Docking Station The final major Creatures release was Docking Station, an Internet-based add-on to Creatures 3, released free of charge on the Creatures web site on March 27, 2001. It was intended as a way to sell Creatures 3 (you could dock the worlds of the two games together, hence the name \\"Docking\\" Station) and extra packs of Norn breeds. Docking Station has an intermittent reminder screen that encourages users to buy Creatures 3. Docking Station added the possibility of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could 'travel' to other online worlds via a central server, players could chat to other online players, and it was possible to track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the Docking Station website. While Docking Station was released late in the series' run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online. Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies. Docking Station also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an 'anti-Shee', the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid). =Creatures Online= Creatures Online was a planned sequel to the game, which was being developed by Fishing Cactus. The game was announced as Creatures 4 in Fishing Cactus's blog in May 2011. Creatures Online was to have 5 worlds, was to be completely in 3D graphics instead of 2.5D pre-rendered graphics, and in-game currency was planned to buy Norns toys, food, etc. Creatures Online was designed to be a free-to-play game. A collector's edition box was also announced with a Norn figurine, the three original games for current PCs, and all the money you paid for the game as in-game money for your Norns. Creatures 4 entered an in-house alpha phase in March 2013. The internal systems of the creatures from C3/DS were retained and updated for the 3D environment. Norns' fur patterns were to be partially procedurally generated, with the goal of ensuring \\"that no two Norns look alike\\". Heterochromia iridum has been introduced. The norns of Creatures Online will have a new drive, tentatively called \\"altruism\\", which encourages them to do things which will benefit the norn colony, like tending to plants and fixing broken toys. \\"Creatures 4\\" was renamed \\"Creatures Online\\" in May 2013. Creatures Online, unlike earlier entries in the Creatures series, was to have a system of missions for the player to complete. Creatures online was cancelled in November 2015 due to the loss of the license. =Younger children's games (later re-released as Creatures Village)= Creatures Adventures Released in 2000, and targeted at younger children (ages 6‚Äì9), Creatures Adventures dropped the complex interface of the main series in favour of brighter graphics and a more childlike atmosphere. Creatures Playground The second game in the younger children's series, Creatures Playground (released the same year), could be connected to Adventures to create an even bigger world to explore. It has a theme park for the creatures, including mini-games like whack-a-mole. =Console games= The Creatures concept was made into three different games for consoles: Creatures for the Game Boy Advance and Creatures and Creatures: Raised in Space for PlayStation. In the PlayStation games, the hand is replaced by a fairy named Scrubby. Because of the limited processing power of the early-day consoles, the AI had to be completely reprogrammed by the console development team around Volker Eloesser. A fourth, Project Loci, was in development at the time of Creatures Labs' liquidation, but was cancelled for lack of funds. Loci would have been the first Creatures game for the PS2, Xbox and GameCube. Later bundled releases There have been various re-releases of the Creatures games. The later re-releases from Gameware improved Windows XP compatibility by allowing them to run easily under non-administrator accounts and without the use of the compatibility mode, but break compatibility with some third-party content without the use of a third-party patch. ;Creatures Trilogy / Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection This release of Creatures Trilogy included Creatures, Creatures 2, and Creatures 3, as well as the Life Kit addons for the earlier games. It was released before Docking Station, but the version of Creatures 3 included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with Docking Station. Encore Software released a Creatures Trilogy containing Creatures, Creatures 2, and Creatures 3, under their Encare line. They also released a \\"gold\\" version titled Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection. ;Creatures Internet Edition / Creatures Gold The final major Creatures release was a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as Creatures Internet Edition, a bundle of Creatures 3, Creatures 3 Update 2, Docking Station, and a number of environment extras and tools (many with multilingual variants). Linux Game Publishing released a Linux port of Creatures Internet Edition a few months later in December 2001. The original Creatures Internet Edition was released again in 2002 by Focus Multimedia, without the physical manual, as Creatures Gold, but the disc contents were identical (and so the installer and PDF manual both referred to it as Creatures Internet Edition). ;Creatures: The Albian Years Creatures 1 and Creatures 2 on one disk, updated to run on Windows XP. ;Creatures Exodus Creatures 3 and Docking Station plus a selection of new Norn breeds on one disk, updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows & Mac dual-format, and free downloadable versions are also available. ;Creatures Village Creatures Adventures and Creatures Playground, merged and updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows & Mac dual-format versions are also available. ;Creatures Triple Collection Creatures Triple Pack, otherwise known as Creatures Collection: Triple, contains The Albian Years, Creatures Exodus and Creatures Village for Windows. Reception As of September 2017, the Creatures Community, or CC, is still very active online and in the games; Each year, the Community holds a festival called the Creatures Community Spirit Festival, or CCSF, to celebrate the games and the community that has formed since the creation of the game. Players have always ranged in age and the enthusiasm for the games is still very high. Several reviews of the series emphasize that the player will need patience, and recommend it for players who are not parents. The early games do not have specific goals, leading some reviewers to consider it a 'small scale genetic experiment' rather than a game. One reviewer compares the game to a virtual 'fish tank', feeling that once the frustration of raising norns through their childhood was over and a breeding population had been established, the game became boring for him. Several reviewers compared Creatures favourably to Tamagotchi when Creatures first came out. For Caroline Daniel, it is intriguing what our interactions with the game will reveal about us.

Compare with variable bitrate. When referring to codecs, constant bit rate encoding means that the rate at which a codec's output data should be consumed is constant. CBR is useful for streaming multimedia content on limited capacity channels since it is the maximum bit rate that matters, not the average, so CBR would be used to take advantage of all of the capacity. CBR is not optimal for storing data as it may not allocate enough data for complex sections (resulting in degraded quality); and if it maximizes quality for complex sections, it will waste data on simple sections. The problem of not allocating enough data for complex sections could be solved by choosing a high bitrate to ensure that there will be enough bits for the entire encoding process, though the size of the file at the end would be proportionally larger. Most coding schemes such as Huffman coding or run- length encoding produce variable-length codes, making perfect CBR difficult to achieve. This is partly solved by varying the quantization (quality), and fully solved by the use of padding. (However, CBR is implied in a simple scheme like reducing all 16-bit audio samples to 8 bits.) In the case of streaming video as a CBR, the source could be under the CBR data rate target. So in order to complete the stream, it's necessary to add stuffing packets in the stream to reach the data rate wanted. These packets are totally neutral and don't affect the stream.

Traditionally these bathhouses have been quite utilitarian, with a tall barrier separating the sexes within one large room, a minimum of lined up faucets on both sides and a single large bath for the already washed bathers to sit in among others. Since the second half of the 20th century, these communal bathhouses have been decreasing in numbers as more and more Japanese residences now have baths. Some Japanese find social importance in going to public baths, out of the theory that physical proximity/intimacy brings emotional intimacy, which is termed skinship in pseudo-English Japanese. Others go to a sent≈ç because they live in a small housing facility without a private bath or to enjoy bathing in a spacious room and to relax in saunas or jet baths that often accompany new or renovated sent≈çs. Another type of Japanese public bath is onsen, which uses hot water from a natural hot spring. In general, the word onsen means that the bathing facility has at least one bath filled with natural hot spring water. However, throughout the Kansai region of Japan the word \\"onsen\\" is also a commonly used naming scheme for sent≈ç. Sent≈ç and supersent≈ç in Kansai that do have access to a hot spring will often differentiate themselves by having \\"natural hot spring\\" (Â§©ÁÑ∂Ê∏©Ê≥â) somewhere on their signage. Layout and architectural features General Layout of a Sent≈ç =Entrance area= There are many different looks for a Japanese sent≈ç, or public bath. Most traditional sent≈ç, however, are very similar to the layout shown on the right. The entrance from the outside looks somewhat similar to a temple, with a Japanese curtain (ÊöñÁ∞æ, noren) across the entrance. The curtain is usually blue and shows the kanji ÊπØ (yu, lit. hot water) or the corresponding hiragana „ÇÜ. After the entrance, there is an area with shoe lockers, followed by two long curtains or door, one on each side. These lead to the datsuijo (ËÑ±Ë°£Â†¥, changing room), also known as datsuiba for the men and women respectively. The men's and the women's side are very similar and differ only slightly. =Changing room= Bandai in the Edo Tokyo Open Air Museum A public bathing facility in Japan typically has one of two kinds of entrances. One is the front desk variety, where a person in charge sits at a front desk, abbreviated as \\"front.\\" The other entrance variety is the bandai style. In Tokyo, 660 sent≈ç facilities have a \\"front\\"-type entrance, while only 315 still have the more traditional bandai-style entrance. Inside, between the entrances is the bandai (Áï™Âè∞), where the attendant sits. The bandai is a rectangular or horseshoe- shaped platform with a railing, usually around 1.5 to 1.8 m high. Above the bandai is usually a large clock. Immediately in front of the bandai is usually a utility door, to be used by the attendants only. The dressing room is approximately 10 m by 10 m, sometimes partly covered with tatami sheets and contains the lockers for the clothes. Often, there is a large shelf storing equipment for regular customers. The ceiling is very high, at 3 to 4 m. The separating wall between the men's and the women's side is about 1.5 m high. The dressing room also often has access to a very small Japanese garden with a pond, and a Japanese-style toilet. There are a number of tables and chairs, including some coin-operated massage chairs. Usually, there is also a scale to measure weight, and sometimes height. In some very old sent≈ç, this scale may use the traditional Japanese measure monme (ÂåÅ, 1 monme = 3.75 g) and kan (1 kan = 1000 monme = 3.75 kg). Similarly, in old sent≈ç the height scale may go only to 180 cm. Local business often advertises in the sent≈ç. The women's side usually has some baby beds, and may have more mirrors. The decoration and the advertising is often gender-specific on the different sides. There is usually a refreshment cooler here where customers can self-serve and pay the attendant. Milk drinks are traditional favorites and sometimes there is ice cream. =Bathing area= The bathing area is separated from the changing area by a sliding door to keep the heat in the bath. An exception are baths in the Okinawa region, as the weather there is usually already hot, and there is no need to keep the hot air in the bath. Sent≈ç in Okinawa usually have no separation between the changing room and the bathing area or only a small wall with an opening to pass through. The bathing area is usually tiled. Near the entrance area is a supply of small stools and buckets. There are a number of washing stations at the wall and sometimes in the middle of the room, each with usually two faucets (karan, „Ç´„É©„É≥, after the Dutch word kraan for faucet), one for hot water and one for cold water, and a shower head. At the end of the room are the bathtubs, usually at least two or three with different water temperatures, and maybe a 'denki buro' (ÈõªÊ∞óÈ¢®ÂëÇ, electric bath). In the Osaka and Kansai area the bathtubs are more often found in the center of the room, whereas in Tokyo they are usually at the end of the room. The separating wall between the men and the women side is also about 1.5 m high. The ceiling may be 4 m high, with large windows in the top. On rare occasions, the separating wall also has a small hole. This was used to pass soap. At the wall on the far end of the room is usually a large ceramic tile mural or painting for decoration. Most often this is Mount Fuji, but it may be a general Japanese landscape, a (faux) European landscape, a river or ocean scene. On rarer occasions, it may also show a group of warriors or a female nude on the male side. Playing children or a female beauty often decorate the women's side. =Boiler room= Behind the bathing area is the boiler room (ÈáúÂ†¥, kamaba), where the water is heated. This may use oil or electricity, or any other type of fuel such as wood chippings. The tall chimneys of the boilers are often used to locate the sent≈ç from far away. After World War II, Tokyo often had power outages when all bathhouse owners turned on the electric water heating at the same time. =Sauna= Many modern sent≈ç have a sauna with a bathtub of cold water (around 17 degrees Celsius) just outside it for cooling off afterwards. Visitors are typically expected to pay an extra fee to use the sauna, and are often given a wristband to signify this payment. Etiquette This section describes the basic procedure to use a sent≈ç. The Japanese public bath is one area where the uninitiated can upset regular customers by not following correct bathing etiquette designed to respect others; in particular, not washing before bathing, introducing soap into the bathwater, and horseplay. Sent≈ç commonly display a poster describing bathing etiquette and procedures in Japanese or occasionally in other languages for international customers. Some ports in Hokkaid≈ç, frequently used by foreign fishing fleets, had problems with drunken sailors misbehaving in the bath. Subsequently, a few bathhouses chose not to allow foreign customers at all. It is common to hear people say, \\"gokuraku, gokuraku\\" when they get into the bath. It means something to the level of divine pleasure; it is a good feeling for the body and the soul. =Equipment= Taking a bath at a public sent≈ç requires at a bare minimum a small towel and some soap/shampoo. Attendants usually sell these items for 100-200 yen. Many people bring two towels; a hand towel for drying and a handtowel or washcloth for washing. A nylon scrubbing cloth or scrub brush with liquid soap is normally used for washing. Other body hygiene products may include a pumice stone, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving equipment, combs, shower caps, pomade, make up products, powder, creams, etc. Some regular customers store their bucket of bathing equipment on open shelves in the dressing room. =Entrance and undressing= In Japan it is customary to remove one's shoes when entering a private home. Similarly, shoes are removed before entering the bathing area in a sent≈ç. They are kept in a shoe locker. The locker is usually available free of charge. In a gender-segregated sent≈ç, bathers go through one of the two doors. The men's door usually has a blue color and the kanji for man (Áî∑, otoko), and the women's door usually has a pink color and the kanji for woman (Â•≥, onna). The attendant usually provides at extra cost a variety of bath products including towel, soap, shampoo, razor, and comb, ice cream or juice from the freezer can also be paid for here. There are usually free lockers with keys (that may be worn on the wrist into the baths) or large baskets provided to put personal effects. =Bathing area= At onsen, or hot springs, the water contains minerals, and many people do not rinse off the water from the skin, to increase exposure to the minerals. In a regular sent≈ç, people usually rinse off at the faucets. 1901 image of Sent≈ç . =Tattoos= Some public baths have signs refusing entry for people with tattoos. However, one may be allowed in if the tattoos are not too obvious. If one ventures to a public bathing place that is publicly owned, this should not present a problem as they have a duty to let all tax-paying citizens in. The original reason behind the ban was to keep out the yakuza (officially called the \\"violence groups\\" by the police). Sanitation Japanese public baths have experienced infrequent outbreaks of dangerous Legionella bacteria. In order to prevent such problems, the sent≈ç union adds chlorine to its baths. At the cost of higher levels of chlorine, bacteria outbreaks are practically non-existent at sent≈ç facilities of today. Pricing Interior of a modern Sent≈ç Rules and pricing are regulated per prefecture based on local committees. Basic entrance fee for adults at a sent≈ç in Tokyo is ¬•450. Citing rise in oil prices as rationale, price has been raised from ¬•400 (2000-2006), to ¬•430 (2006-2008), and again to ¬•450 (2008-present). In Tokyo, the price for children to enter have remained unchanged: 6- to 11-year-olds can enter at ¬•180 each, while younger children can enter at ¬•80 each. Girls 13 years or younger and boys 8 or younger are usually permitted to enter the baths of either gender. In other prefectures, the cut off age can be as high as 16 in Hokkaid≈ç or as low as 5 in Hy≈çgo. Most sent≈ç in Tokyo also offer a premium service for which each facility sets its own price, usually around ¬•1,000. This option is usually called a sauna, since at least sauna is included. At Civic Land Nissei, for example, the sauna option includes access to more than half of all the facilities available. Larger scale public bathing facility types are called super sent≈ç and kenk≈ç land, both more expensive than sent≈ç, while super sent≈ç offer a more compromised price. At ¬•300 per adult, the cheapest prefectures to sent≈ç baths are in Yamagata, Tokushima, Nagasaki, ≈åita, and Miyazaki. History The origins of the Japanese sent≈ç and the Japanese bathing culture, in general, can be traced to the Buddhist temples in India, from where it spread to China, and finally to Japan during the Nara period (710‚Äì784). About \\"Sento\\" Japanese communal bath house Tokyo Sento Association =Nara period to Kamakura period= The Nara period to Kamakura period is defined as \\"religious bathing\\". Initially, due to its religious background, baths in Japan were usually found in a temple. These baths were called y≈´ya (, lit. hot water shop), or later when they increased in size ≈çyuya (, lit. big hot water shop). These baths were most often steam baths (, mushiburo, lit. steam bath). While initially these baths were only used by priests, sick people gradually also gained access, until in the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) sick people were routinely allowed access to the bathhouse. Wealthy merchants and members of the upper class soon also included baths in their residences. =Kamakura period= The first mentioning of a commercial bathhouse is in 1266 in the Nichiren Goshoroku (). These mixed-sex bathhouses were only vaguely similar to modern bathhouses. After entering the bath, there was a changing room called datsuijo (). There the customer also received his/her ration of hot water, since there were no faucets in the actual bath. The entrance to the steam bath was only a very small opening with a height of about 80 cm, so that the heat did not escape. Due to the small opening, the lack of windows, and the thick steam, these baths were usually very dark, and customers often cleared their throats to signal their position to others. =Edo period= Onna yu (\\"Bathhouse Women\\") by Torii Kiyonaga (1752‚Äì1815) At the beginning of the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), there were two types of baths common to the eastern and western regions of Japan respectively. In Edo (present day Tokyo), bath houses contained sizable pools, and were called yuya (ÊπØÂ±ã, lit. hot water shop). In Osaka, however, bathing establishments were primarily steam baths called mushiburo (Ëí∏„ÅóÈ¢®ÂëÇ, lit. steam bath) that had only shallow pools. At the end of the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603‚Äì1868) at different times required baths to segregate by sex in order to ensure public moral standards. However, many bathhouse owners merely partitioned their baths with a small board, allowing some voyeurism to persist. Other baths avoided this problem by having men and women bathe at different times of day, or by catering to one gender exclusively. In spite of this, laws regarding mixed-sex bathing were soon relaxed again. Contributing to the popularity of public baths in the Edo period were female bathing attendants known as yuna (ÊπØÂ•≥, lit. hot water women). These attendants helped cleanse customers by scrubbing their backs. After official closing hours, however, a number of these women would perform additional services by selling sex to male customers. Similarly, some brothels in contemporary Japan have women who specialize in bathing with and cleansing male clientele. Such establishments are often called s≈çpu rando („ÇΩ„Éº„Éó„É©„É≥„Éâ, soapland). As a preventive measure against prostitution, the Tokugawa shogunate stipulated that no more than three yuna serve at any given bathhouse. However, this rule was widely ignored, causing the shogunate to ban female attendants from bathhouses altogether and once again prohibit the practice of mixed-sex bathing. Large numbers of unemployed yuna thereafter moved to official red-light districts, where they could continue their services. Up until 1870, there were also male washing assistants called sansuke (‰∏âÂä©, lit. three helps) who would wash and massage customers of both genders. Unlike the yuna, these male attendants were not known to engage in prostitution. Mixed-sex bathing was prohibited once again after Commodore Perry visited Japan in 1853 and 1854‚Äîdrawing question to the morality of the practice. =Meiji period= Bathing in an Agricultural School in Japan around 1920 During the Meiji period (1867‚Äì1912) the design of Japanese baths changed considerably. The narrow entrance to the bathing area was widened considerably to a regular-sized sliding door, the bathtubs were sunk partially in the floor so that they could be entered more easily, and the height of the ceiling of the bathhouse was then doubled. Since the bath now focused on hot water instead of steam, windows could be added, and the bathing area became much brighter. The only difference between these baths and the modern bath was the use of wood for the bathing area and the lack of faucets. Furthermore, another law for segregated bathing was passed in 1890, allowing only children below the age of 8 to join a parent of the opposite sex. =Rebuilding= At the beginning of the Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926), tiles gradually replaced wooden floors and walls in new bathhouses. On September 1, 1923 the great Kant≈ç earthquake devastated Tokyo. The earthquake and the subsequent fire destroyed most baths in the Tokyo area. This accelerated the change from wooden baths to tiled baths, as almost all new bathhouses were now built in the new style using tiled bathing areas. At the end of the Taish≈ç period, faucets also became more common, and this type of faucet can still be seen today. These faucets were called karan („Ç´„É©„É≥, after the Dutch word kraan for faucet). There were two faucets, one for hot water and one for cold water, and the customer mixed the water in his bucket according to his personal taste. =Golden era= Entrance of a typical sent≈ç in Tokyo During World War II (for Japan 1941‚Äì1945), many Japanese cities were damaged. Subsequently, most bathhouses were destroyed along with the cities. The lack of baths caused the reappearance of communal bathing, and temporary baths were constructed with the available material, often lacking a roof. Furthermore, as most houses were damaged or destroyed, few people had access to a private bath, resulting in a great increase in customers for the bathhouses. New buildings in the post-war period also often lacked baths or showers, leading to a strong increase in the number of public baths. In 1965 many baths also added showerheads to the faucets in the baths. The number of public baths in Japan peaked around 1970. =Decline= A group of young men walk past a typical community bath in the Kitakagaya neighborhood of Osaka, Japan Immediately after World War II, resources were scarce and few homeowners had access to a private bath. Private baths began to be more common around 1970, and most new buildings included a bath and shower unit for every apartment. Easy access to private baths led to a decline in customers for public bathhouses, and subsequently the number of bathhouses is decreasing. Some Japanese young people today are embarrassed to be seen naked, and avoid public baths for this reason. Some Japanese are concerned that without the \\"skinship\\" of mutual nakedness, children will not be properly socialized. =Future= While the traditional sent≈ç is in decline, many bathhouse operators have adjusted to the new taste of the public and are offering a wide variety of experiences. Some bathhouses emphasize their tradition, and run traditionally-designed bathhouses to appeal to clientele seeking the lost Japan. These bathhouses are also often located in scenic areas and may include an open-air bath. Some also try drilling in order to gain access to a hot spring, turning a regular bathhouse into a more prestigious onsen. Other bathhouses with less pristine buildings or settings change into so-called super sent≈ç and try to offer a wider variety of services beyond the standard two or three bathtubs. They may include a variety of saunas, reintroduce steam baths, include jacuzzis, and may even have a water slide. They may also offer services beyond mere cleansing, and turn into a spa, offering medical baths, massages, mud baths, fitness centers, etc., as for example the Spa LaQua at the Tokyo Dome City entertainment complex. There are also entire bathhouse theme parks, including restaurants, karaoke, and other entertainment, as for example the ≈åedo Onsen Monogatari (Â§ßÊ±üÊà∏Ê∏©Ê≥âÁâ©Ë™û, Big Edo Hot Spring Story) in Odaiba, Tokyo. (Note: The ≈åedo Onsen Monogatari is not a sent≈ç.) Some of these modern facilities may require the use of swimsuits and are similar to a water park.

It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen, Quentin Tarantino, and Edward Bunker as diamond thieves whose planned heist of a jewelry store goes terribly wrong. The film depicts the events before and after the heist. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks, and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. It incorporates many motifs that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling. The film is regarded as a classic of independent film and a cult film, and was named \\"Greatest Independent Film of all Time\\" by Empire. Although controversial for its depictions of violence and use of profanity, Reservoir Dogs was generally well received, with the cast being praised by many critics. Despite not being heavily promoted during its theatrical run, the film became a modest success in the United States after grossing $2.8 million against its scant budget. It achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction (1994). A soundtrack was released featuring songs used in the film, which are mostly from the 1970s.  Plot  Eight men eat breakfast at a Los Angeles diner before carrying out a diamond heist. Led by Joe Cabot and his son and underboss \\"Nice Guy\\" Eddie Cabot, all other criminals use aliases: Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink. After discussing the Madonna song \\"Like a Virgin\\" and arguing over Pink's habit of not tipping, the group leaves the diner to perform the heist. After the heist, White flees with Orange, who was shot in the stomach by an armed woman during the escape and is bleeding severely in the back of the getaway car. At one of Joe's warehouses, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup, and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde has murdered several innocent civilians during the heist; White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ a \\"psychopath\\" like Blonde. Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby. He argues with White over whether or not they should get medical attention for Orange, and the pair end up having a fight and draw guns at each other. They stand down when Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash. Sometime earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots, having completed a four-year jail sentence. To reward him for not having given Joe's name to the authorities for a lighter sentence, they offer him a no-show job. Blonde insists that he wants to get back to \\"real work,\\" and they recruit him for the heist. In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie arrives and orders them to retrieve the stashed diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Whilst dancing to Stealers Wheel's \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\", Blonde tortures Nash before cutting off his right ear with a straight razor. Blonde then retrieves a gasoline can from his car, and is about to set Nash on fire, but Orange suddenly wakes up and shoots Blonde to death, saving Nash's life. Orange then reveals to Nash that he is an undercover police officer and the police will arrive shortly. Earlier, Orange ‚Äì real name Freddy Newendyke ‚Äì uses an elaborate tale of drug delivery to gain acceptance into the gang. Shortly thereafter, White becomes friends with Orange. Back in the present, Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie impulsively kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, as Blonde was a longtime friend of his father. Joe then arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, whom he suspects is the traitor behind the setup, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint, insisting that White does not believe Orange is responsible. Eddie promptly aims at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three fire; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are hit. Pink, the only uninjured person, takes the diamonds and flees. As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms, Orange confesses that he is an undercover officer; White sobs in betrayal and reluctantly presses his gun to Orange's head. In the background, Pink is heard attempting to escape and possibly being arrested, as the police storm the warehouse off screen and order White to drop his gun. White shoots Orange and collapses as gunfire erupts.  Cast  The film's opening credits sequence, a slow-motion scene featuring the eight criminals, accompanied by \\"Little Green Bag\\" by the George Baker Selection  Production  Quentin Tarantino had been working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and originally planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16 mm black- and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co- producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth. Reservoir Dogs was, according to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: \\"I didn't go out of my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did think of it as my 'Killing', my take on that kind of heist movie.\\" The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire. The warehouse used in the film was in reality an abandoned mortuary. This explains the hearse Blonde is sitting on while White and Pink are arguing. In scenes with Orange in his apartment, the second floor of the mortuary was used and dressed up to look like living quarters. The location has since been demolished. Of his decision not to show the heist itself, Tarantino has said that the reason was initially budgetary but that he had always liked the idea of not showing it and stuck with that idea in order to make the details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is \\"about other things\\", a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross and its film adaptation in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about something that is not seen and that he wanted it to \\"play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking\\". The title for the film came from a customer at the Video Archives, who requested Louis Malle's 1987 film Au revoir les enfants, but mispronounced the title \\"reservoir\\".  Reception  = Box office = Reservoir Dogs premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1992. It became the festival's most talked-about film, and was subsequently picked up for distribution by Miramax Films. After being shown at several other film festivals, including in Cannes, Sitges, and Toronto, Reservoir Dogs opened in the United States in 19 theaters with a first week total of $147,839. It was expanded to 61 theaters and totaled $2,832,029 at the domestic box office. The film grossed more than double that in the United Kingdom, where it did not receive a home video release until 1995. During the period of unavailability on home video, the film was re- released in UK cinemas in June 1994. = Critical reception = Reservoir Dogs is regarded as an important and influential milestone of independent filmmaking. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92% based on 71 reviews, and an average rating of 8.87/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Thrumming with intelligence and energy, Reservoir Dogs opens Quentin Tarantino's filmmaking career with hard-hitting style.\\" On Metacritic the film has an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Empire magazine named it the \\"Greatest Independent Film\\" ever made. At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, film critic Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News compared the effect of Reservoir Dogs to that of the 1895 film L'Arriv√©e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, when audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said \\"Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.\\" Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its \\"deadpan sense of humor\\". Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic; he felt that the script could have been better and said that the film \\"feels like it's going to be terrific\\", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also said that Tarantino \\"has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.\\" Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, \\"I liked what I saw, but I wanted more.\\" Ebert's biggest praise was the acting in the film. The film has received substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene; Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea \\"I've got a little kid at home.\\" Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, 15 people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a \\"compliment\\" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented about it at the time: \\"It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing.\\" = Critical analysis = Reservoir Dogs has often been seen as a prominent film in terms of on-screen violence. J.P. Telotte compared Reservoir Dogs to classic caper noir films and points out the irony in its ending scenes. Mark Irwin also made the connection between Reservoir Dogs and classic American noir. Caroline Jewers called Reservoir Dogs a \\"feudal epic\\" and paralleled the color pseudonyms to color names of medieval knights. Critics have observed parallels between Reservoir Dogs and other films. For its nonlinear storyline, Reservoir Dogs has often been compared to Rashomon. Critic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in Psycho and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between Reservoir Dogs and Glengarry Glen Ross. Todd McCarthy, who called the film \\"undeniably impressive\\", was of the opinion that it was influenced by Mean Streets, Goodfellas and The Killing. After this film, Tarantino himself was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara. A frequently cited comparison has been to Tarantino's second and more successful film Pulp Fiction, especially since the majority of audiences saw Reservoir Dogs after the success of Pulp Fiction. Comparisons have been made regarding the black humor in both the films, the theme of accidents, and more concretely, the style of dialogue and narrative that Tarantino incorporates into both films. Specifically the relationship between whites and blacks plays a big part in the filmsthough underplayed in Reservoir Dogs. Stanley Crouch of The New York Times compared the way the white criminals speak of black people in Reservoir Dogs to the way they are spoken of in Scorsese's Mean Streets and Goodfellas. Crouch observed the way black people are looked down upon in Reservoir Dogs, but also the way that the criminals accuse each other of \\"verbally imitating\\" black men and the characters' apparent sexual attraction to black actress Pam Grier. In February 2012, as part of an ongoing series of live dramatic readings of film scripts being staged with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), director Jason Reitman cast black actors in the originally white cast: Laurence Fishburne as Mr. White; Terrence Howard as Mr. Blonde; Anthony Mackie as Mr. Pink; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Mr. Orange; Chi McBride as Joe Cabot; Anthony Anderson as Nice Guy Eddie (Joe Cabot's son); Common as both Mr. Brown and Officer Nash (the torture victim of Mr. Blonde), and Patton Oswalt as Holdaway (the mentor cop who was originally played by Randy Brooks, the only black actor in the film). Critic Elvis Mitchell suggested that Reitman's version of the script was taking the source material back to its roots since the characters \\"all sound like black dudes.\\" = Accolades = The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. It won the Critic's Award at the 4th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1993 which Tarantino attended. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Steve Buscemi won the 1992 Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. Reservoir Dogs ranks at 97 in Empire magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.  Home media  In the United Kingdom, release of the VHS rental video was delayed until 1995 due to the British Board of Film Classification initially refusing the film a home video certificate (UK releases are required to be certified separately for theatrical release and for viewing at home). The latter is a requirement by law due to the Video Recordings Act 1984. Following the UK VHS release approval, Polygram released a \\"Mr Blonde Deluxe Edition\\", which included an interview with Tarantino and several memorabilia associated with the character Mr. Blonde, such as sunglasses and a chrome toothpick holder. Region 1 DVDs of Reservoir Dogs have been released multiple times. The first release was a single two-sided disc from LIVE Entertainment, released in June 1997 and featuring both open matte and letterbox versions of the film. Five years later, on August 27, 2002, Artisan Entertainment (who changed their name from LIVE Entertainment in the interim) released a two-disc 10th anniversary edition on DVD and VHS featuring multiple covers color-coded to match the nicknames of five of the characters (Pink, White, Orange, Blonde, and Brown) and a disc of bonus features such as interviews with the cast and crew. However, the full screen version on the second disc was a pan and scan transfer from the widescreen 2.39:1 version, as opposed to open matte like the '97 DVD. For the film's 15th anniversary, Lionsgate (which had purchased Artisan in the interim) produced a two-disc anniversary edition with a remastered 16:9 transfer and a new supplement, but not all of the extra features from the 10th Anniversary edition. In particular, interviews with the cast and crew were removed, and a new 48-minute-long feature called \\"Tributes and Dedications\\" was included.  Soundtrack  The Reservoir Dogs: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was the first soundtrack for a Quentin Tarantino film and set the structure his later soundtracks would follow. This includes the extensive use of snippets of dialogue from the film. The soundtrack has selections of songs from the 1960s to '80s. Only the group Bedlam recorded original songs for the film. Reasoning that the film takes place over a weekend, Tarantino decided to set it to a fictional radio station 'K-Billy' (presumably KBLY)'s show \\"K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend\\", a themed weekend show of broadcasts of songs from the seventies. The radio station played a prominent role in the film. The DJ for the radio was chosen to be Steven Wright, a comedian known for his deadpan delivery of jokes. An unusual feature of the soundtrack was the choice of songs; Tarantino has said that he feels the music to be a counterpoint to the on-screen violence and action. He also stated that he wished for the film to have a 1950s feel while using '70s music. A prominent instance of this is the torture scene to the tune of \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\". Bedlam was a 1990s rock group from Nashville fronted by Jay Joyce, who were signed to MCA Records. Their album Into the Coals was released in 1992. Further members were Chris Feinstein (bass) and Doug Lancio. \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" is a cover of the 1968 Steppenwolf song. \\"Harvest Moon\\" is written by Jay Joyce. Sandy Rogers' \\"Fool for Love\\" initially was the title song to Robert Altman's 1985 film Fool for Love.

However, the game does not feature the likeness of any of the actors with the exception of Michael Madsen. The game was received unfavorably, with GameSpot calling it \\"an out and out failure\\". It caused controversy for its amount of violence and was banned in Australia and New Zealand. Another video game, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days, was released in 2017. On December 14, 2017, Overkill Software added a heist to Payday 2 inspired by Reservoir Dogs in which the player is contracted to rob a jewelry store in Los Angeles with the Cabot family. It is unique in that the heist is played in reverse order, with day two occurring prior to day one, similar to how the film's plot is out of chronological order.  Remakes  Kaante, a Bollywood film released in 2002, is a remake of Reservoir Dogs, combined with elements of City on Fire. The film also borrows plot points from The Usual Suspects, Heat and The Killing. Tarantino has been quoted as saying that Kaante is his favorite among the many films inspired by his work. Tarantino later screened Kaante at his New Beverly Cinema alongside Reservoir Dogs and City on Fire.

A frogman is someone who is trained in scuba diving or swimming underwater in a tactical capacity that includes police or military work. Such personnel are also known by the more formal names of combat diver, combatant diver, or combat swimmer. The word frogman first arose in the stage name The Fearless Frogman of Paul Boyton in the 1870s and later was claimed by John Spence, an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy and member of the OSS Maritime Unit, to have been applied to him while he was training in a green waterproof suit. The term frogman is occasionally used to refer to a civilian scuba diver. Some sport diving clubs include the word Frogmen in their names. The preferred term by scuba users is diver, but the frogman epithet persists in informal usage by non-divers, especially in the media and often referring to professional scuba divers, such as in a police diving role. In the U.S. military and intelligence community, divers trained in scuba or CCUBA who deploy for tactical assault missions are called \\"combat divers\\". This term is used to refer to US Army Special Forces (aka Green Berets) Combat Divers, Navy SEALs/Naval Special Warfare, operatives of the CIA's Special Activities Center, elements of Marine Recon, Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen, Army Ranger Regimental Reconnaissance Company members, Air Force Pararescue, Air Force Combat Controllers, United States Air Force Special Operations Weather Technicians, and the Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units. In Britain, police divers have often been called \\"police frogmen\\". Some countries' tactical diver organizations include a translation of the word frogman in their official names, e.g., Denmark's Fr√∏mandskorpset; others call themselves \\"combat divers\\" or similar. Others call themselves by indefinite names such as \\"special group 13\\" and \\"special operations unit\\". Many nations and some irregular armed groups deploy or have deployed combat swimmers or divers. Definition Merriam-Webster defines a frogman as a person equipped for extended periods of underwater swimming, and particularly for military reconnaissance and demolition. The Oxford English Dictionary states: \\"A person who swims under water wearing a rubber suit, flippers, and an oxygen supply.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica provides a narrower definition for Frogman, Naval personnel (which suggests the possibility of other meanings) as an unarmed member of a US Navy underwater demolition team which reconnoitred beach landing areas, observed enemy positions near the shore, and detected and cleared dangerous underwater obstructions. The Cambridge Dictionary defines a frogman as: \\"someone who swims or works underwater for a long time wearing breathing equipment, flippers, and usually a rubber suit\\". The Macmillan Dictionary definition is identical for British and American English as: \\"someone who does police or military work under water using special clothes and equipment\\". Collins English Dictionary gives \\"a swimmer equipped with a rubber suit, flippers, and breathing equipment for working underwater\\" as the British English definition, and \\"a person trained and equipped, as with a rubber suit and scuba apparatus, for underwater demolition, exploration, etc.\\" as an American definition, citing Webster's New World College Dictionary, 4th Edition. Copyright 2010 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. They also indicate a trend of steadily decreasing usage from the mid 20th century to 2008, and the word may be obsolescent. The Dictionary of American Slang reports that colloquial meanings include a scuba diver, particularly a professional or military diver of WWII. Scope of operations Tactical diving is a branch of professional diving carried out by armed forces and tactical units. They may be divided into: * Combat/assault divers. * Special mission work divers (called Clearance Divers in the British Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy), who do general work underwater. * Work divers who are trained in defusing mines and removing other explosives underwater. These groups may overlap, and the same men may serve as assault divers and work divers, such as the Australian Clearance Diving Branch (RAN). The range of operations performed by these operatives includes: *Amphibious assault: stealthy deployment of land or boarding forces. The vast majority of combat swimmer missions are simply to get \\"from here to there\\" and arrive suitably equipped and in sufficient physical condition to fight on arrival. The deployment of tactical forces by water to assault land targets, oil platforms, or surface ship targets (as in boardings for seizure of evidence) is a major driver behind the equipping and training of combat swimmers. The purposes are many, but include feint and deception, counter-drug, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and counter- proliferation missions. *Sabotage: This includes putting limpet mines on ships. *Clandestine surveying: Surveying a beach before a troop landing, or other forms of unauthorized underwater surveying in denied waters. *Clandestine underwater work, e.g.: ** Recovering underwater objects. ** Clandestine fitting of monitoring devices on submarine communications cables in enemy waters. *Investigating unidentified divers, or a sonar echo that may be unidentified divers. Police diving work may be included here. See anti- frogman techniques. *Checking ships, boats, structures, and harbors for limpet mines and other sabotage; and ordinary routine maintenance in war conditions. If the inspection divers during this find attacking frogmen laying mines, this category may merge into the previous category. *Underwater mine clearance and bomb disposal. Typically, a diver with closed circuit oxygen rebreathing equipment will stay within a depth limit of with limited deeper excursions to a maximum of because of the risk of seizure due to acute oxygen toxicity. The use of nitrox or mixed gas rebreathers can extend this depth range considerably, but this may be beyond the scope of operations, depending on the unit. =Mission descriptions= US and UK forces use these official definitions for mission descriptors: ; Stealthy: Keeping out of sight (e.g., underwater) when approaching the target. ; Covert: Carrying out an action of which the enemy may become aware, but whose perpetrator cannot easily be discovered or apprehended. Covert action often involves military force which cannot be hidden once it has happened. Stealth on approach, and frequently on departure, may be used. ; Clandestine: It is intended that the enemy does not find out then or afterwards that the action has happened. Installing eavesdropping devices is the best example. Approach, installing the devices, and departure are all to be kept from the knowledge of the enemy. If the operation or its purpose is exposed, then the actor will usually make sure that the action at least remains \\"covert\\", or unattributable. =Defending against frogmen= Anti-frogman techniques are security methods developed to protect watercraft, ports and installations, and other sensitive resources both in or nearby vulnerable waterways from potential threats or intrusions by frogmen. Equipment Frogmen on clandestine operations use rebreathers, as the bubbles released by open-circuit scuba would reveal them to surface lookouts and make a noise which hydrophones could easily detect. History Davis apparatus, a rebreather originally conceived in 1910 by Robert Davis as an emergency submarine escape set. In ancient Roman and Greek times, etc., there were instances of men swimming or diving for combat, sometimes using a hollow plant stem or a long bone as a snorkel. Diving with snorkel is mentioned by Aristotle (4th century BC).Aristotle, On the Parts of Animals, ii, 16), transl. by W.Ogle, London, 1882, p. 51: \\"Just then as divers are sometimes provided with instruments for respiration, through which they can draw air from above the water, and thus may remain for a long time under the sea, so also have elephants been furnished by nature with their lengthened nostril, and, whenever they have to traverse the water, they lift this up above the surface and breathe through it.\\" The earliest descriptions of frogmen in war are found in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War. The first instance was in 425 BC, when the Athenian fleet besieged the Spartans on the small island of Sphacteria. The Spartans managed to get supplies from the mainland by underwater swimmers towing submerged sacks with supplies. In another incident of the same war, in 415 BC, the Athenians used combat divers in the port of Syracuse, Sicily. The Syracuseans had planted vertical wooden poles in the bottom around their port, to prevent the Athenian triremes from entering. The poles were submerged, not visible above the sea level. The Athenians used various means to cut these obstacles, including divers with saws.Thukydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, edition Ambrosio Firmin Didot, Paris, 1842, book 4, 26, and b. 7, 25. In Greek and Latin. It is believed that the underwater sawing required snorkels for breathing and diving weights to keep the divers stable.Pierros D. Nick, The tactics of the enemies in the sea warfare during the Peloponnesian War. 1st Pan-Corinthian Congress, Corinth, Greece, 2008. In Greek. N. Pierros is a Civil Engineer and author of historical essays. Also, in the writings of Al- Maqrizi, it is also claimed that the naval forces of the Fatimid Caliphate, in an engagement with Byzantine forces off the coast of Messina henceforth referred to as the Battle of the Straits, employed a novel strategy with strong similarities to modern-day Frogmen tactics. In the writings of Heinz Halm, who studied and translated the writings of Al-Maqrizi and other contemporary Islamic historians, it is described: \\"They would dive from their own ship and swim over to the enemy ship; they would fasten ropes to its rudder, along which earthenware pots containing Greek fire were then made to slide over to the enemy ship, and shattered on the sternpost\\". Apparently, This tactic succeeded in destroying many Byzantine vessels, and the battle ended in a major Fatimid victory; according to the Arab historians, a thousand prisoners were taken, including the Byzantine admiral, Niketas, with many of his officers, as well as a heavy Indian sword which bore an inscription indicating that it had once belonged to Muhammad. The Hungarian Chronicon Pictum claims that Henry III's 1052 invasion of Hungary was defeated by a skillful diver who sabotaged Henry's supply fleet. The unexpected sinking of the ships is confirmed by German chronicles. On 4 November 1918, during World War 1, Italian frogmen sunk the Austro-Hungarian ship \\"Viribus Unitis\\" Italy started World War II with a commando frogman force already trained. Britain, Germany, the United States, and the Soviet Union started commando frogman forces during World War II. =First frogmen= The word frogman appeared first in the stage name The Fearless Frogman of Paul Boyton, who since the 1870s broke records in long distance swimming to demonstrate a new invented rubber immersion suit, with an inflated hood shaped like a frog. As a stunt show hero in that suit he played a military diver (attaching mines to ships etc.) long before such divers existed. The first modern frogmen were the World War II Italian commando frogmen, of Decima Flottiglia MAS (now \\"ComSubIn\\": Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei) which formed in 1938 and was first in action in 1940. Originally these divers were called \\"Uomini Gamma\\" because they were members of the top secret special unit called \\"Gruppo Gamma\\", which originated from the kind of Pirelli rubber skin-suit nicknamed muta gamma used by these divers. Later they were nicknamed \\"Uomini Rana\\", Italian for \\"frog men\\", because of an underwater swimming frog kick style, similar to that of frogs, or because their fins looked like frog's feet.Manuale Federale di Immersione - author Duilio Marcante This special corps used an early oxygen rebreather scuba set, the Auto Respiratore ad Ossigeno (A.R.O), a development of the Dr√§ger oxygen self-contained breathing apparatus designed for the mining industry and of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus made by Siebe, Gorman & Co and by Bergomi, designed for escaping from sunken submarines. This was used from about 1920 for spearfishing by Italian sport divers, modified and adapted by the Italian navy engineers for safe underwater use and built by Pirelli and SALVAS from about 1933, and so became a precursor of the modern diving rebreather. For this new way of underwater diving, the Italian frogmen trained in La Spezia, Liguria, using the newly available Genoese free diving spearfishing equipment; diving mask, snorkel, swimfins, and rubber dry suit, the first specially made diving watch (the luminescent Panerai), and the new A.R.O. scuba unit.Teseo Tesei e gli assaltatori della Regia Marina author Gianni Bianchi This was a revolutionary alternative way to dive, and the start of the transition from the usual heavy underwater diving equipment of the hard hat divers which had been in general use since the 18th century, to self-contained divers, free of being tethered by an air line and rope connection. =Wartime operations= After Italy declared war, the Decima Flottiglia MAS (X¬™ MAS) attempted several attacks on British naval bases in the Mediterranean between June 1940 and July 1941, but none were successful, because of equipment failure or early detection by British forces. On September 10, 1941, eight X¬™ MAS frogmen were inserted by submarine close to the British harbour at Gibraltar, where using human torpedoes to penetrate the defences, sank three merchant ships with limpet mines before escaping through neutral Spain. An even more successful attack, the Raid on Alexandria, was mounted on 19 December on the harbour at Alexandria, again using human torpedoes. The raid resulted in disabling the battleships and together with a destroyer and an oil tanker, but all six frogmen were captured. The British Royal Navy had captured an Italian human torpedo during a failed attack on Malta; they developed a copy called the Chariot and formed a unit called the Experimental Submarine Flotilla, which later merged with the Special Boat Service. A number of Chariot operations were attempted, most notably Operation Title in October 1942, an attack on the German battleship Tirpitz, which had to be abandoned when a storm hit the fishing boat which was towing the Chariots into position. The last and most successful British operation resulted in sinking two liners in Phuket harbour in Thailand in October 1944. Royal Navy divers did not use fins until December 1942. =Wartime developments= In 1933 Italian companies were already producing underwater oxygen rebreathers, but the first scuba diving set is generally recognised inside the US as being invented in 1939 by Christian Lambertsen, who dubbed it the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU). and patented it in 1940.Lambertsen's patent in Google Patents He later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment. Lambertson demonstrated it to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (after already being rejected by the U.S. Navy) in a pool at a hotel in Washington D.C. OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Dr. Lambertsen to lead the program and build-up the dive element of their maritime unit. The OSS was the predecessor of Special Forces and Central Intelligence Agency the maritime element still exists inside their Special Activities Division. John Spence, an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy, was the first man selected to join the OSS group. In an interview with historian Erick Simmel, Spence claimed that the name \\"frogman\\" was coined while he was training in a green waterproof suit, \\"Someone saw me surfacing one day and yelled out, 'Hey, frogman!' The name stuck for all of us.\\" =Postwar operations= In April 1956, Commander Lionel Crabb, a wartime pioneer of Royal Navy combat diving, disappeared during a covert inspection of the hull of the Soviet Navy Sverdlov class cruiser, Ordzhonikidze, while she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour. The Shayetet 13 commandos of the Israeli Navy have carried out a number of underwater raids on harbors. They were initially trained by veterans of X¬™ MAS and used Italian equipment. As part of Operation Raviv in 1969, eight frogmen used two human torpedoes to enter Ras Sadat naval base near Suez, where they destroyed two motor torpedo boats with mines. During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentinian Naval Intelligence Service planned an attack on British warships at Gibraltar. Code named Operation Algeciras, three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on the ships' hulls. The operation was abandoned when the divers were arrested by Spanish police and deported. In 1985, the French nuclear weapons tests at Moruroa in the Pacific Ocean was being contested by environmental protesters led by the Greenpeace campaign ship, Rainbow Warrior. The Action Division of the French Directorate-General for External Security devised a plan to sink the Rainbow Warrior while it was berthed in harbor at Auckland in New Zealand. Two divers from the Division posed as tourists and attached two limpet mines to the ship's hull; the resulting explosion sank the ship and killed a Netherlands citizen on board. Two agents from the team, but not the divers, were arrested by the New Zealand Police and later convicted of manslaughter. The French government finally admitted responsibility two months later. In 1989, during the U.S. invasion of Panama, a team of four U.S. Navy SEALs using rebreathers conducted a combat swimmer attack on the Presidente Porras, a gunboat and yacht belonging to Manuel Noriega. The commandos attached explosives to the vessel as it was tied to a pier in the Panama Canal, escaping only after being attacked with grenades. Three years later during Operation Restore Hope, members of SEAL Team One swam to shore in Somalia to measure beach composition, water depth, and shore gradient ahead of a Marine landing. The mission resulted in several of the SEALs becoming ill as Somalia's waters were contaminated with raw sewage.

Atlantic Ocean-related lists ","title":"List of beaches"},{"id":"297117","text":"Hydrofluoric acid is a solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in water. Solutions of HF are colourless, acidic and highly corrosive. It is used to make most fluorine-containing compounds; examples include the commonly used pharmaceutical antidepressant medication fluoxetine (Prozac) and the material PTFE (Teflon). Elemental fluorine is produced from it. It is commonly used to etch glass and silicon wafers. When hydrofluoric acid comes into contact with human skin it causes deep burns. Uses =Production of organofluorine compounds= The principal use of hydrofluoric acid is in organofluorine chemistry. Many organofluorine compounds are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including Teflon, fluoropolymers, fluorocarbons, and refrigerants such as freon. Many pharmaceuticals contain fluorine. =Production of inorganic fluorides= Most high-volume inorganic fluoride compounds are prepared from hydrofluoric acid. Foremost are Na3AlF6, cryolite, and AlF3, aluminium trifluoride. A molten mixture of these solids serves as a high-temperature solvent for the production of metallic aluminium. Other inorganic fluorides prepared from hydrofluoric acid include sodium fluoride and uranium hexafluoride. =Etchant, cleaner= Wet etching tanks It is used in the semiconductor industry as a major component of Wright Etch and buffered oxide etch, which are used to clean silicon wafers. In a similar manner it is also used to etch glass by treatment with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water- soluble silicon fluorides. It can also be used to polish and frost glass. :SiO2 \\\\+ 4 HF ‚Üí SiF4(g) + 2 H2O :SiO2 \\\\+ 6 HF ‚Üí H2SiF6 \\\\+ 2 H2O A 5% to 9% hydrofluoric acid gel is also commonly used to etch all ceramic dental restorations to improve bonding. For similar reasons, dilute hydrofluoric acid is a component of household rust stain remover, in car washes in \\"wheel cleaner\\" compounds, in ceramic and fabric rust inhibitors, and in water spot removers. Because of its ability to dissolve iron oxides as well as silica- based contaminants, hydrofluoric acid is used in pre-commissioning boilers that produce high-pressure steam. Hydrofluoric acid is also useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks. Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it. =Oil refining= In a standard oil refinery process known as alkylation, isobutane is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propylene and butylene) in the presence of an acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propylene, butylene) to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30 ¬∞C) in a two-phase reaction. Production Hydrofluoric acid was first prepared in 1771, by Carl Wilhelm Scheele . It is now mainly produced by treatment of the mineral fluorite, CaF2, with concentrated sulfuric acid at ca. 265 ¬∞C. :CaF2 \\\\+ H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 HF + CaSO4 The acid is also a by-product of the production of phosphoric acid from apatite/fluoroapatite. Digestion of the mineral with sulfuric acid at elevated temperatures releases a mixture of gases, including hydrogen fluoride, which may be recovered. Because of its high reactivity toward glass, hydrofluoric acid is stored in plastic containers. Hydrofluoric acid can be found in nature, having been released in a volcanic eruption. Properties In dilute aquous solution hydrogen fluoride behaves as a weak acid, Infrared spectroscopy has been used to show that, in solution, dissociation is accompanied by formation of the ion pair ¬∑F‚àí. : + 2HF + F‚àí \\\\+ ‚ãÖF‚àí, pKa = 3.17 This ion pair has been characterized in the crystalline state at very low temperature. Further association has been characterized both in solution and in the solid state. :HF + F‚àí HF2‚àí log K = 0.6 It is assumed that polymerization occurs as the concentration increases. This assumption is supported by the isolation of a salt of a tetrameric anion H3F4‚àí and by low- temperature X-ray crystallography. The species that are present in concentrated aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride have not been characterized; the formation of polymeric species, Hn-1Fn‚àí, is highly likely. The Hammett acidity function, H0, for 100% HF is estimated to be between ‚àí10.2 and ‚àí11. which is comparable to the value ‚àí12 for sulfuric acid. Solutions of hydrofluoric acid attack glass, so they are stored and used in vessels made of teflon. They attack human skin, so must be handled with great care: see #Health and Safety, below. Acidity Unlike other hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride is only a weak acid in dilute aqueous solution. This is in part a result of the strength of the hydrogen‚Äìfluorine bond, but also of other factors such as the tendency of HF, , and anions to form clusters. At high concentrations, HF molecules undergo homoassociation to form polyatomic ions (such as bifluoride, ) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity. This leads to protonation of very strong acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric when using concentrated hydrofluoric acid solutions. Although hydrofluoric acid is regarded as a weak acid, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass when hydrated. The acidity of hydrofluoric acid solutions varies with concentration owing to hydrogen-bond interactions of the fluoride ion. Dilute solutions are weakly acidic with an acid ionization constant (or ), in contrast to corresponding solutions of the other hydrogen halides, which are strong acids (). Concentrated solutions of hydrogen fluoride are much more strongly acidic than implied by this value, as shown by measurements of the Hammett acidity function H0(or \\"effective pH\\"). The H0 for 100% HF is estimated to be between ‚àí10.2 and ‚àí11, comparable to the value ‚àí12 for sulfuric acid. In thermodynamic terms, HF solutions are highly non-ideal, with the activity of HF increasing much more rapidly than its concentration. The weak acidity in dilute solution is sometimes attributed to the high H‚ÄîF bond strength, which combines with the high dissolution enthalpy of HF to outweigh the more negative enthalpy of hydration of the fluoride ion.C. E. Housecroft and A. G. Sharpe \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" (Pearson Prentice Hall, 2nd ed. 2005), p. 170. Paul Gigu√®re and Sylvia Turrell have shown by infrared spectroscopy that the predominant solute species in dilute solution is the hydrogen-bonded ion pair ¬∑F‚àí. : + HF ‚ãÖF‚àí With increasing concentration of HF the concentration of the hydrogen difluoride ion also increases. The reaction :3 HF \\\\rightleftharpoons HF2‚àí \\\\+ H2F+ is an example of homoconjugation. Production Hydrofluoric acid is produced by treatment of the mineral fluorite (CaF2) with concentrated sulfuric acid. When combined at 265 ¬∞C, these two substances react to produce hydrogen fluoride and calcium sulfate according to the following chemical equation: :CaF2 \\\\+ H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 HF + CaSO4 Although bulk fluorite is a suitable precursor and a major source of world HF production, HF is also produced as a by-product of the production of phosphoric acid, which is derived from the mineral apatite. Apatite sources typically contain a few percent of fluoroapatite, acid digestion of which releases a gaseous stream consisting of sulfur dioxide (from the H2SO4), water, and HF, as well as particulates. After separation from the solids, the gases are treated with sulfuric acid and oleum to afford anhydrous HF. Owing to the corrosive nature of HF, its production is accompanied by the dissolution of silicate minerals, and, in this way, significant amounts of fluorosilicic acid are generated. Health and safety A hydrofluoric acid burn of the hand In addition to being a highly corrosive liquid, hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful contact poison. Because of the ability of hydrofluoric acid to penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur readily through exposure of skin or eyes, or when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, and this can provide false reassurance to victims, causing them to delay medical treatment. Despite having an irritating odor, HF may reach dangerous levels without an obvious odor. HF interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing the extent and seriousness of the injury. Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs), and bone damage. Popular culture In an episode of Breaking Bad titled \\"Cat's in the Bag...,\\" Jesse Pinkman uses hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the body of Emilio Koyama. In another episode, ‚ÄúBox Cutter‚Äù, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman use hydrofluoric acid to dissolve the body of Victor. In the film Saw VI, hydrofluoric acid is used for killing William Easton. In the film Jigsaw, Carly is also killed by hydrofluoric acid, injected into her bloodstream. In an episode of Titans titled \\"Jason Todd,\\" a young Dick Grayson claims that his parents' murderer used hydrofluoric acid to burn their trapeze ropes. In a trio of segments of the videogame Zero Time Dilemma titled \\"First Come, First Saved\\", each of the three teams of participants are given the option to press a button that activates a hydrofluoric acid shower that pours over the other two teams. The corrosion process of the acid is both described and depicted as being fast enough to melt everything from the body of a child-sized artificial human to that of a sizable adult male in a matter of seconds, leaving only small amounts of tissue behind.

The project ended in 2002, when the Advanced Space Transportation Program was reorganized and all speculative research (less than Technology readiness level 3) was cancelled. During its six years of operational funding, this program received a total investment of $1.2 million. The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project addressed a selection of ‚Äúincremental and affordable‚Äù research questions towards the overall goal of propellantless propulsion, hyperfast travel, and breakthrough propulsion methods. It selected and funded five external projects, two in-house tasks and one minor grant. At the end of the project, conclusions into fourteen topics, including these funded projects, were summarized by program manager Marc G. Millis. Of these, six research avenues were found to be nonviable, four were identified as opportunities for continued research, and four remain unresolved. Non-viable approaches One in-house experiment tested the Schlicher thruster antenna, claimed by Schlicher to generate thrust. No thrust was observed. Another experiment examined a gravity shielding mechanism claimed by Podkletnov and Nieminen. Experimental investigation on the BPPP and other experiments found no evidence of the effect. Research on quantum tunneling was sponsored by the BPPP. It was concluded that this is not a mechanism for faster-than-light travel. Other approaches categorized as non- viable are oscillation thrusters and gyroscopic antigravity, Hooper antigravity coils, and coronal blowers. Unresolved approaches A theoretical examination of additional atomic energy levels (deep Dirac levels) was carried out. Some states were ruled out, but the problem remains unsolved. Experiments tested Woodward‚Äôs theory of inducing transient inertia by electromagnetic fields. The small effect could not be confirmed. Woodward continued refining the experiments and theory. Independent experiments also remained inconclusive. A possible torsion-like effect in the coupling between electromagnetism and spacetime, which may ultimately be useful for propulsion, was sought in experiments. The experiments were insufficient to resolve the question. Other theories listed in Millis's final assessment as unresolved are Abraham‚ÄìMinkowski electromagnetic momentum, interpreting inertia and gravity quantum vacuum effects, and the Podkletnov force beam.  Space drives  One of the eight tasks funded by the BPP program was to define a strategy towards space drives. As a motivation, seven examples of hypothetical space drives were described at the onset of the project. These included the gravity-based pitch drive, bias drive, disjunction drive and diametric drive; the Alcubierre drive; and the vacuum energy based differential sail. The project then considered the mechanisms behind these drives. At the end of the project, three mechanisms were identified as areas for future research. One considers the possibility of a reaction mass in seemingly empty space, for example in dark matter, dark energy, or zero-point energy. Another approach is to reconsider Mach's principle and Euclidean space. A third research avenue that might ultimately prove useful for spacecraft propulsion is the coupling of fundamental forces on sub-atomic scales.  Quantum vacuum energy experiments  One topic of investigations was the use of the zero-point energy field. As the Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that there is no such thing as an exact amount of energy in an exact location, vacuum fluctuations are known to lead to discernible effects such as the Casimir effect. The differential sail is a speculative drive, based on the possibility of inducing differences in the pressure of vacuum fluctuations on either side of a sail-like structure ‚Äî with the pressure being somehow reduced on the forward surface of the sail, but pushing as normal on the raft surface ‚Äî and thus propel a vehicle forward. The Casimir effect was investigated experimentally and analytically under the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project. This included the construction of MicroElectroMechanical (MEM) rectangular Casimir cavities. Theoretical work showed that the effect could be used to create net forces, although the forces would be extremely small. At the conclusion of the project, the Casimir effect was categorized as an avenue for future research. Tau Zero Foundation After funding ended, program manager Marc G. Millis was supported by NASA to complete documentation of results. The book Frontiers of Propulsion Science was published by the AIAA in February 2009, M. Millis and E. Davis, Frontiers of Propulsion Science, AIAA, Progress in Astronautics & Aeronautics Vol 227, 2009. providing a deeper explanation of several propulsion methods. Following program cancellation in 2002, Millis and others founded the Tau Zero Foundation.

He has received numerous awards and prizes including the Padma Vibhushan, the Dr. Ambedkar International Award, the Gandhi Peace Prize, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Templeton Prize and the Jamnalal Bajaj Award. He is also known as the modern Gandhi of India.  Early life  Murlidhar Devidas \\"Baba\\" Amte was born in an affluent Deshastha Brahmin family on 26 December 1914 in the city of Hinganghat in the Wardha District of Maharashtra. His father, Devidas Amte, was a British government officer working for the district administration and revenue collection departments. Murlidhar Amte acquired the nickname Baba in his childhood. His wife, Sadhanatai Amte, explains that he came to be known as Baba not because \\"he was regarded as a saint or a holy person, but because his parents addressed him by that name.\\" Amte was the eldest of eight children. As the eldest son of a wealthy land owner, he had an idyllic childhood, filled with hunting and sports. By the time he was fourteen, he owned his own gun and hunted bear and deer. When he was old enough to drive, he was given a Singer Sports car with cushions covered with panther skin. Though he was born in a wealthy family he was always aware of the class inequality that prevailed in Indian society. \\"There is a certain callousness in families like my family,\\" he used to say. \\"They put up strong barriers so as to avoid seeing the misery in the outside world and I rebelled against it.\\"  Dedicated works  Trained in law, he developed a successful legal practice in Wardha. He soon became involved in the Indian independence movement from the British Raj and, in 1942, began working as a defense lawyer for Indian leaders imprisoned by the British for their involvement in the Quit India movement. He spent some time at Sevagram, at the ashram started by Mahatma Gandhi and became a follower of Gandhism. He practiced Gandhism by engaging in yarn spinning using a charkha and wearing khadi. When Gandhi got to know that Dr. Amte had defended a girl who the lewd taunts of British soldiers, Gandhi gave him the name ‚Äì Abhay Sadhak (Fearless Seeker of Truth). In those days, people with leprosy suffered a social stigma and the society disowned these people. Amte strove to dispel the widespread belief that leprosy was highly contagious; he even allowed bacilli from a leper to be injected into him as part of an experiment aimed at proving that leprosy was not highly contagious. Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people and people from marginalised sections of the society in Maharashtra. On 15 August 1949, he and his wife Sadhna Amte started a leprosy hospital in Anandvan under a tree. In 1973, Amte founded the Lok Biradari Prakalp to work for the Madia Gond tribal people of Gadchiroli District. Amte devoted his life to many other social causes, most notably the Quit India movement to raise public awareness on the importance of ecological balance, wildlife preservation and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Government of India awarded Baba Amte with a Padma Shri in 1971.  Dedicated works of family members  Amte married Indu Ghuleshastri (later called Sadhanatai Amte). She participated in her husband's social work with equal dedication. Their two sons, Vikas Amte and Prakash Amte, and daughters-in-law, Mandakini and Bharati, are doctors. All four dedicated their lives to social work and causes similar to those of the senior Amte. Prakash and his wife Mandakini run a school and a hospital at Hemalkasa village in the underprivileged district of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra among the Madia Gond tribe, as well as an orphanage for injured wild animals, including a lion and some leopards. She left her governmental medical and moved to Hemalkasa to start the projects after they married. Their two sons, Dr. Digant and Aniket also dedicated their lives to the same causes. In 2008, Prakash and Mandakini received the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. Amte's elder son Vikas and his wife Bharati run the hospital at Anandwan and co-ordinate operations with satellite projects. Anandwan has a university, an orphanage, and schools for the blind and the deaf. The Anandwan ashram is self-sufficient and has over 5,000 residents. Amte later founded \\"Somnath\\" and \\"Ashokwan\\" ashrams for people suffering from leprosy.  Gandhism  Amte followed Gandhi's way of life and led a spartan life. He wore khadi clothes made from the looms at Anandwan. He believed in Gandhi's concept of a self-sufficient village industry that empowers seemingly helpless people, and successfully brought his ideas into practice at Anandwan. Using non-violent means, he played an important role in the struggle for the independence of India. Amte also used Gandhi's principles to fight against corruption, mismanagement, and poor, shortsighted planning in the government. However, Amte never disowned God. He used to say that if there are hundred thousands of universes then God must be very busy. Let us do our work on our own.  Narmada Bachao Andolan with Medha Patkar  In 1990, Amte left Anandwan for a while to live along the Narmada River and joined Narmada Bachao Andolan (\\"Save Narmada\\") movement one of whose popular leaders was Medha Patkar, which fought against both unjust displacement of local inhabitants and damage to the environment due to the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada river.President, PM condole Baba Amte's death .

GMD stands for Gerhard M√ºller Dietlikon. Founded in 1947 by engineer Gerhard M√ºller, who is credited with the invention of the modern detachable chairlift in the late 1940s, it was one of the most prolific and respected aerial lift manufacturers in skiing history. The company was bought out by the management in 1985 after M√ºller's death Overview In the late 1920s, Gerhard M√ºller, a mechanical engineering student, was a newcomer to growing sport of skiing. At the time, there were no user-friendly ski lifts in Switzerland. At a resort hotel outside Z√ºrich, M√ºller created his first usable ski lift consisting of a 1-inch hemp rope and some old motorcycle parts. Naturally, being a rope tow, guests regularly complained about sore hands and torn clothes resulting from using the lift. The Sami people use reindeer to tow themselves around on skis, but they rest their hands by looping the reins around their hips. Inspired by this practice, M√ºller solved the problems of his rope tow by creating the first modern T-bar lift. GMD M√ºller gave the licence for T-bar lift to polish company Mostostal Zabrze in 1959. Some of this lifts are still exists. During the 1960s and 1970s GMD M√ºller installed more than one hundred fixed-grip chairlifts in North America. Many of these lifts are still in service today. In Europe 4-seater gondola lifts with M√ºller's patented detachable cable grips and T-bars were more popular. Some resorts, such as Whistler, were at the time exclusively equipped with M√ºller lifts. GMD M√ºller is also noted for inventing the Aerobus, a self-propelled bus-like vehicle riding on a suspended overhead cable.

Early Korean monks believed that the traditions they received from foreign countries were internally inconsistent. To address this, they developed a new holistic approach to Buddhism. This approach is characteristic of virtually all major Korean thinkers, and has resulted in a distinct variation of Buddhism, which is called Tongbulgyo (\\"interpenetrated Buddhism\\"), a form that sought to harmonize all disputes (a principle called hwajaeng ÂíåË´ç) by Korean scholars. Korean Buddhist thinkers refined their predecessors' ideas into a distinct form. As it now stands, Korean Buddhism consists mostly of the Seon Lineage, primarily represented by the Jogye and Taego Orders. The Korean Seon has a strong relationship with other Mahayana traditions that bear the imprint of Chan teachings as well as the closely related Zen. Other sects, such as the modern revival of the Cheontae lineage, the Jingak Order (a modern esoteric sect), and the newly formed Won, have also attracted sizable followings. Korean Buddhism has contributed much to East Asian Buddhism, especially to early Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan schools of Buddhist thought.Chunwei Song (Oct. 2008). Heroes Brought Buddhism to the East of the Sea: A Fully Annotated Translation of The Preface of Haedong Kos≈≠ng Ch≈èn, Sino-Platonic Papers 183 Historical overview and development Monks going down to their rooms after evening prayers at Haeinsa. When Buddhism was originally introduced to Korea from Former Qin in 372, about 800 years after the death of the historical Buddha, shamanism was the indigenous religion. As it was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship, Buddhism was allowed by adherents of Shamanism to be blended into their religion. Thus, the mountains that were believed by shamanists to be the residence of spirits in pre-Buddhist times later became the sites of Buddhist temples. Though it initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goryeo period, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon era, which lasted over five hundred years. During this period, Neo-Confucianism overcame the prior dominance of Buddhism. Only after Buddhist monks helped repel the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) did the persecution of Buddhists stop. Buddhism in Korea remained subdued until the end of the Joseon period, when its position was strengthened somewhat by the colonial period, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. However, these Buddhist monks did not only put an end to Japanese rule in 1945, but they also asserted their specific and separate religious identity by reforming their traditions and practices. They laid the foundation for many Buddhist societies, and the younger generation of monks came up with the ideology of Mingung Pulgyo, or \\"Buddhism for the people.\\" The importance of this ideology is that it was coined by the monks who focused on common men's daily issues. After World War II, the Seon school of Korean Buddhism once again gained acceptance. A 2005 government survey indicated that about a quarter of South Koreans identified as Buddhist.According to figures compiled by the South Korean National Statistical Office. However, the actual number of Buddhists in South Korea is ambiguous as there is no exact or exclusive criterion by which Buddhists can be identified, unlike the Christian population. With Buddhism's incorporation into traditional Korean culture, it is now considered a philosophy and cultural background rather than a formal religion. As a result, many people outside of the practicing population are deeply influenced by these traditions. Thus, when counting secular believers or those influenced by the faith while not following other religions, the number of Buddhists in South Korea is considered to be much larger. Similarly, in officially atheist North Korea, while Buddhists officially account for 4.5% of the population, a much larger number (over 70%) of the population are influenced by Buddhist philosophies and customs.Religious Intelligence UK Report North Korea, about.com Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms When Buddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century CE, the Korean peninsula was politically subdivided into three kingdoms: Goguryeo in the north (which included territory currently in Russia and China), Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. There is concrete evidence of an earlier introduction of Buddhism than traditionally believed. A mid-4th century tomb, unearthed near Pyongyang, is found to incorporate Buddhist motifs in its ceiling decoration. Korean Buddhist monks traveled to China or India in order to study Buddhism in the late Three Kingdoms Period, especially in the 6th century. In 526, The monk Gyeomik (Ë¨ôÁõä) from Baekje traveled via the southern sea route to India to learn Sanskrit and study the Vinaya. The monk Paya (Ê≥¢Ëã•; 562-613?) from Goguryeo is said to have studied under the Tiantai master Zhiyi. Other Korean monks of the period brought back numerous scriptures from abroad and conducted missionary activity throughout Korea. Several schools of thought developed in Korea during these early times: *the Samlon (‰∏âË´ñÂÆó) or East Asian MƒÅdhyamaka school focused on MƒÅdhyamaka doctrine *the Gyeyul (ÊàíÂæãÂÆó, or Vinaya in Sanskrit) school was mainly concerned with the study and implementation of ≈õƒ´la or \\"moral discipline\\" *the Yeolban (Ê∂ÖÊßÉÂÆó, or NirvƒÅna in Sanskrit) school based in the themes of the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra *the Wonyung (ÂúìËûçÂÆó, or Yuanrong in Chinese) school formed toward the end of the Three Kingdoms Period. This school lead to the actualization of the metaphysics of interpenetration as found in the Avatamsaka Sutra and was considered the premier school, especially among the educated aristocracy. *the Hwaeom (ËèØÂö¥ÂÆó or Huayan school) was the longest lasting of the \\"imported\\" schools. It had strong ties with the Beopseong (Ê≥ïÊÄßÂÆó), an indigenous Korean school of thought. The date of the first mission from Korea to Japan is unclear, but it is reported that a second detachment of scholars was sent to Japan upon invitation by the Japanese rulers in 577. The strong Korean influence on the development of Buddhism in Japan continued through the Unified Silla period. It was not until the 8th century that independent study by Japanese monks began in significant numbers. =Goguryeo= In 372, the monk Sundo (È†ÜÈÅì, pinyin: Sh√πnd√†o) was sent by Fu Jian (337‚Äì385) (ËãªÂ†Ö) of Former Qin to the court of the King Sosurim of Goguryeo. He brought texts and statues (possibly of Maitreya, who was popular in Buddhism in Central Asia), and the Goguryeo royalty and their subjects quickly accepted his teachings. Buddhism in China was in a rudimentary form, consisting of the law of cause and effect and the search for happiness. This had much in common with the predominant Shamanism, which likely led to the quick assimilation of Buddhism by the people of Goguryeo. Early Buddhism in Silla developed under the influence of Goguryeo. Some monks from Goguryeo came to Silla and preached among the people, making a few converts. In 551, Hyeryang (ÊÉ†‰∫Æ), a Goguryeo monk was appointed the first National Patriarch of Silla. He first presided over the \\"Hundred-Seat Dharma Assembly\\" and the \\"Dharma of Eight Prohibitions\\". =Baekje= In 384, the Indian monk Marananta arrived in Baekje and the royal family received the strain of Buddhism that he brought. King Asin of Baekje proclaimed, \\"people should believe in Buddhism and seek happiness.\\" In 526, the Baekje monk Gyeomik (Í≤∏Ïùµ, Ë¨ôÁõä) traveled directly to Central India and came back with a collection of Vinaya texts, accompanied by the Indian monk Paedalta (Sanskrit: Vedatta). After returning to Baekje, Gyeomik translated the Buddhist scriptures in Sanskrit into seventy-two volumes. The Gyeyul school in Baekje was established by Gyeomik about a century earlier than its counterpart in China. As a result of his work, he is regarded as the father of Vinaya studies in Korea. =Silla= Reliquary Buddhism did not enter the kingdom of Silla until the 5th century. The common people were first attracted to Buddhism here, but there was resistance among the aristocrats. In 527, however, a prominent court official named Ichadon presented himself to King Beopheung of Silla and announced he had become Buddhist. The king had him beheaded, but when the executioner cut off his head, it is said that milk poured out instead of blood. Paintings of this are in the temple at Haeinsa and a stone monument honoring his martyrdom is in the National Museum of Kyongju. During the reign of the next king, Jinheung of Silla, the growth of Buddhism was encouraged and eventually recognized as the national religion of Silla. Selected young men were physically and spiritually trained at Hwarangdo according to Buddhist principles regarding one's ability to defend the kingdom. King Jinheung later became a monk himself. The monk Jajang (ÊÖàËóè) is credited with having been a major force in the adoption of Buddhism as a national religion. Jajang is also known for his participation in the founding of the Korean monastic sangha. Another great scholar to emerge from the Silla Period was Wonhyo. He renounced his religious life to better serve the people and even married a princess for a short time, with whom he had a son. He wrote many treatises and his philosophy centered on the unity and interrelatedness of all things. He set off to China to study Buddhism with a close friend, Uisang, but only made it part of the way there. According to legend, Wonhyo awoke one night very thirsty. He found a container with cool water, which he drank before returning to sleep. The next morning he saw that the container from which he had drunk was a human skull and he realized that enlightenment depended on the mind. He saw no reason to continue to China, so he returned home. Uisang continued to China and after studying for ten years, offered a poem to his master in the shape of a seal that geometrically represents infinity. The poem contained the essence of the Avatamsaka Sutra. Buddhism was so successful during this period that many kings converted and several cities were renamed after famous places during the time of the Buddha. Buddhism in the North‚ÄìSouth States Period (668-935) =Unified Silla (668-935)= A stone image of a Buddha, near Gyeongju, South Korea. 7th century Silla. In 668, the kingdom of Silla succeeded in unifying the whole Korean peninsula, giving rise to a period of political stability that lasted for about one hundred years under Unified Silla. This led to a high point in scholarly studies of Buddhism in Korea. The most popular areas of study were Wonyung, Yusik (Ch. ÂîØË≠ò; Weishi) or East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra, Jeongto or Pure Land Buddhism, and the indigenous Korean Beopseong (\\"Dharma-nature school\\"). Wonhyo taught the Pure Land practice of yeombul, which would become very popular amongst both scholars and laypeople, and has had a lasting influence on Buddhist thought in Korea. His work, which attempts a synthesis of the seemingly divergent strands of Indian and Chinese Buddhist doctrines, makes use of the Essence-Function (È´îÁî® che-yong) framework, which was popular in native East Asian philosophical schools. His work was instrumental in the development of the dominant school of Korean Buddhist thought, known variously as Beopseong, Haedong (Êµ∑Êù±, \\"Korean\\") and later as Jungdo (‰∏≠ÈÅì, \\"Middle Way\\") Wonhyo's friend Uisang (Áæ©Êπò) went to Chang'an, where he studied under Huayan patriarchs Zhiyan (Êô∫ÂÑº; 600-668) and Fazang (Ê≥ïËóè; 643-712). When he returned after twenty years, his work contributed to Hwaeom Buddhism and became the predominant doctrinal influence on Korean Buddhism together with Wonhyo's tongbulgyo thought. Hwaeom principles were deeply assimilated into the Korean meditation-based Seon school, where they made a profound effect on its basic attitudes. Influences from Silla Buddhism in general, and from these two philosophers in particular crept backwards into Chinese Buddhism. Wonhyo's commentaries were very important in shaping the thought of the preeminent Chinese Buddhist philosopher Fazang, and Woncheuk's commentary on the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana-s≈´tra had a strong influence in Tibetan Buddhism. The intellectual developments of Silla Buddhism brought with them significant cultural achievements in many areas, including painting, literature, sculpture, and architecture. During this period, many large and beautiful temples were built. Two crowning achievements were the temple Bulguksa and the cave-retreat of Seokguram (Áü≥Á™üÂ∫µ). Bulguksa was famous for its jeweled pagodas, while Seokguram was known for the beauty of its stone sculpture. =Balhae (698-926)= Buddhism also flourished in the northern Korean Kingdom of Balhae, established after the fall of Goguryeo, as the state religion. The remains of ten Buddhist temples have been found in the remains of the capital of Balhae, Sanggyeong, together with such Buddhist artifacts as Buddha statuettes and stone lanterns, which suggests that Buddhism played a predominant role in the life of the Balhae people. The Balhae tomb Majeokdal in Sinpo, South Hamgyong Province, are associated with pagodas and temples: This also indicates that Buddhism had a strong influence over the funerary rituals in Balhae. After the fall of Balhae, sixty monks from Balhae including the monk Jaeung (ËºâÈõÑ) fled together to the newly founded kingdom of Goryeo (918-1392). = Seon = A new epoch in Korean Buddhism began during the latter Silla with the birth of schools of Korean Seon. In China, the movement toward a meditation-based practice, which came to be known as Chan Buddhism, had begun during the sixth and seventh centuries, and it was not long before the influence of the new meditational school reached Korea, where it was known as Seon. The term is more widely known in the West in its Japanese variant, Zen. Tension developed between the new meditational schools and the pre- existing academically oriented schools, which were described by the term gyo, meaning \\"learning\\" or \\"study.\\" Kim Gyo-gak (ÈáëÂñ¨Ë¶∫; 630-729), a prince who became a monastic, came to the region of Anhui to Mount Jiuhua in China. Many Chinese Buddhists believe he was indeed the transformation body of K·π£itigarbha. Two uncles sent by his mother and wife to call him back also became monastics there. His well-preserved, dehydrated body is seen at the monastery he built on Mount Jiuhua today. The two uncles, being officials before becoming monastics, found it difficult to abstain from wine and meat, and so practiced in another place on the mount. People built the palace of the two saints (‰∫åËÅñÊÆø) in their practice place to memorialize them. Many Buddhists visit there. Beomnang (Ê≥ïÊúó; fl. 632-646), said to be a student of the Chinese master Daoxin (ÈÅì‰ø°; 580-651), is generally credited with the initial transmission of Chan into Korea. It was popularized by Sinhaeng (Á•ûË°å; 704-779) in the latter part of the eighth century and by Doui (ÈÅìÁæ©; died 825) at the beginning of the ninth century. From then on, many Koreans studied Chan in China, and upon their return established their own schools at various mountain monasteries with their leading disciples. Initially, the number of these schools was fixed at nine, and Korean Seon was then termed the \\"nine mountain schools\\" (‰πùÂ±± or gusan). Eight of these were of the Mazu Daoyi (È¶¨Á•ñÈÅì‰∏Ä; 709-788) lineage, as they were established through connection with either him or one of his eminent disciples. The one exception was the Sumi-san school founded by Ieom (Âà©Âö¥; 869-936), which had developed from the Caodong school (ÊõπÊ¥û).

(2008). The Power of the Buddhas: the Politics of Buddhism during the Kory≈è Dynasty (918-1392), p. 3.Keele, S. (1078). Buddhism and political Power in Korean History, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 1 (1), 9-24 Initially, the new Seon schools were regarded by the established doctrinal schools as radical and dangerous upstarts. Thus, the early founders of the various \\"nine mountain\\" monasteries met with considerable resistance, repressed by the long influence in court of the Gyo schools. The struggles which ensued continued for most of the Goryeo period, but gradually the Seon argument for the possession of the true transmission of enlightenment gained the upper hand. The position that was generally adopted in the later Seon schools, due in large part to the efforts of Jinul (Áü•Ë®•; 1158-1210), did not claim clear superiority of Seon meditational methods, but rather declared the intrinsic unity and similarities of the Seon and Gyo viewpoints. Although all these schools are mentioned in historical records, toward the end of the dynasty, Seon became dominant in its effect on the government and society, as well as the production of noteworthy scholars and adepts. During the Goryeo period, Seon thoroughly became a \\"religion of the state,\\" receiving extensive support and privileges through connections with the ruling family and powerful members of the court. =Hwaeom (Huayan) and Seon= Although most of the scholastic schools waned in activity and influence during this period of Seon's growth, the Hwaeom school continued to be a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo, much of it continuing the legacy of Uisang and Wonhyo. In particular the work of Gyunyeo (ÂùáÂ¶Ç; 923-973) prepared for the reconciliation of Hwaeom and Seon, with Hwaeom's accommodating attitude toward the latter. Gyunyeo's works are an important source for modern scholarship in identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaeom. Another important advocate of Seon/Gyo unity was Uicheon. Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with Hwaeom. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the Cheontae (), which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as \\"five doctrinal and two meditational schools\\". Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished. =Jinul= The most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was Jinul. In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become involved with secular affairs, incorporating practices such as fortune-telling and offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. Inclination toward these practices resulted in the profusion of an increasingly larger number of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. The correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism became prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period. Tripitaka Koreana at Haeinsa. Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Seon which he called the \\"samƒÅdhi and praj√±ƒÅ society\\" () whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of Songgwangsa at Mt. Jogye (ÊõπÊ∫™Â±±). Jinul's works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chan, and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between \\"gradual\\" and \\"sudden\\" methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by Huayan Patriarch Guifeng Zongmi (780-841) and Linji master Dahui Zonggao (Â§ßÊÖß; 1089-1163), Jinul created a \\"sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice\\" dictum that he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts. From Dahui Zonggao, Jinul also incorporated the hwadu method into his practice. This form of meditation is the main method taught in Seon today. Jinul's philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism. =Late Goryeo= The general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment. However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea's most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: Gyeonghan Baeg'un (ÊôØÈñëÁôΩÈõ≤; 1298-1374), Taego Bou (Â§™Âè§ÊôÆÊÑö; 1301-1382) and Naong Hyegeun (Êá∂ÁøÅÊÖßÂã§; 1320-1376). All three went to Yuan China to learn the hwadu practice of the Linji school () that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about a considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional tongbulgyo tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of Confucianism and Taoism, due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be \\"three teachings\\" exponents appeared. A significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the Tripi·π≠aka called the Tripitaka Koreana. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by the Mongols in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at Haeinsa in Gyeongsang. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years. Suppression under the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) Dalmado by Gim Myeong-guk, 17th century In 1388, an influential general named Yi Seonggye (1335-1408) carried out a coup d'√©tat and established himself as the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty in 1392 with the support of this Neo-Confucian movement. He was posthumously renamed Emperor Taejo of Joseon in 1899. Joseon Buddhism, which had started off under the so-called \\"five doctrinal and two meditational\\" schools system of the Goryeo, was first condensed to two schools: Seon and Gyo. Eventually, these were further reduced to the single school of Seon. Despite this strong suppression from the government, and vehement ideological opposition from Korean Neo-Confucianism, Seon Buddhism continued to thrive intellectually. An outstanding thinker was Gihwa (Â∑±Âíå; (Hamheo Deuktong Ê∂µËôöÂæóÈÄö) 1376-1433), who had first studied at a Confucian academy, but then changed his focus to Buddhism, where he was initiated to the gwanhwa tradition by Muhak Jacho (ÁÑ°Â≠∏Ëá™Ë∂Ö; 1327-1405). He wrote many scholarly commentaries, as well as essays and a large body of poetry. Being well-versed in Confucian and Taoist philosophies, Giwha also wrote an important treatise in defense of Buddhism, from the standpoint of the intrinsic unity of the three teachings, entitled the Hyeonjeong non. In the tradition of earlier philosophers, he applied che-yong (\\"essence-function\\") and Hwaeom (sa-sa mu- ae, \\"mutual interpenetration of phenomena\\"). Common in the works of Joseon scholar-monks are writings on Hwaeom-related texts, as well as the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana, Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, Diamond Sutra and the Heart Sutra. The Jogye order instituted a set curriculum of scriptural study, including the above-mentioned works, along with other shorter selections from eminent Korean monks, such as Jinul. During the Joseon period, the number of Buddhist monasteries dropped from several hundred to a mere thirty-six. Limits were placed on the number of clergy, land area, and ages for entering the sangha. When the final restrictions were in place, monks and nuns were prohibited from entering the cities. Buddhist funerals, and even begging, were outlawed. However, some rulers occasionally appeared who looked favorably upon Buddhism and did away with some of the more suppressive regulations. The most noteworthy of these was the Queen Munjeong, who, as a devout Buddhist, took control of the government in the stead of her young son Myeongjong (r. 1545-67), and immediately repealed many anti-Buddhist measures. The queen had deep respect for the brilliant monk Bou (Î≥¥Ïö∞, ÊôÆÈõ®; 1515-1565), and installed him as the head of the Seon school. One of the most important reasons for the restoration of Buddhism to a position of minimal acceptance was the role of Buddhist monks in repelling the Japanese invasions of Korea, which occurred between 1592 and 1598. At that time, the government was weak from internal squabbles, and was not initially able to muster strong resistance to the incursion. The plight of the country encouraged some leaders of the sangha to organize monks into guerrilla units, which enjoyed some instrumental successes. The \\"righteous monk\\" (Áæ©Â£´; uisa) movement spread during this eight-year war, finally including several thousand monks, led by the aging Seosan Hyujeong (ÏÑúÏÇ∞ÎåÄÏÇ¨, Ë•øÂ±±‰ºëÈùú; 1520-1604), a first-rate Seon master and the author of a number of important religious texts. The presence of the monks' army was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders. Seosan is also known for continuing efforts toward the unification of Buddhist doctrinal study and practice. His efforts were strongly influenced by Wonhyo, Jinul, and Gihwa. He is considered the central figure in the revival of Joseon Buddhism, and most major streams of modern Korean Seon trace their lineages back to him through one of his four main disciples: Yu Jeong (1544-1610); Eongi (1581-1644), Taeneung (1562-1649) and Ilseon (1533-1608), all four of whom were lieutenants to Seosan during the war with Japan. Statue of one of the Four Heavenly Kings The biographies of Seosan and his four major disciples are similar in many respects, and these similarities are emblematic of the typical lifestyle of Seon monks of the late Goryeo and Joseon periods. Most of them began by engaging in Confucian and Daoist studies. Turning to Seon, they pursued a markedly itinerant lifestyle, wandering through the mountain monasteries. At this stage, they were initiated to the central component of Seon practice, the gong'an, or gwanhwa meditation. This gwanhwa meditation, unlike Zen traditions, did not consist of contemplation on a lengthy, graduated series of k≈çans. In contrast, the typical Korean approach was that \\"all gong'an are contained in one\\" and therefore it was, and still is, quite common for the practitioner to remain with one hwadu during his whole meditational career, most often Zhaozhou Congshen's \\"mu.\\" Buddhism during the three centuries, from the time of Seosan down to the next Japanese incursion into Korea in the late nineteenth century, remained fairly consistent with the above-described model. A number of eminent teachers appeared during the centuries after Seosan, but the Buddhism of the late Joseon, while keeping most of the common earlier characteristics, was especially marked by a revival of Hwaeom studies, and occasionally by new interpretations of methodology in Seon study. There was also a revival, during the final two centuries, of Pure Land Buddhism. Although the government maintained fairly tight control of the sangha, there was never again the extreme suppression of the early Joseon. Buddhism under Japanese colonial rule During Japan's Meiji Restoration in the 1870s, the government abolished celibacy for Buddhist monks and nuns. Japanese Buddhists won the right to proselytize inside cities, ending a five-hundred year ban on clergy members entering cities. J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ and Nichiren schools began sending missionaries to Korea and new sects formed in Korea such as Won Buddhism. After the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, when Japan annexed Korea, Korean Buddhism underwent many changes. The Temple Ordinance of 1911 () changed the traditional system whereby temples were run as a collective enterprise by the Sangha, replacing this system with Japanese-style management practices in which temple abbots appointed by the Governor-General of Korea were given private ownership of temple property and given the rights of inheritance to such property. More importantly, monks from pro-Japanese factions began to adopt Japanese practices, by marrying and having children. In 1920, the Temple Ordinance was revised to reorganize temple administration and allow the Japanese government to directly oversee the 31 main temples in the country, with new headquarters at Kakwangsa (now Jogyesa). During the Second Sino- Japanese War, Korean Buddhism was placed under greater control. Japanese authorities had many temples' artworks shipped to Japan. Negotiations for the repatriation of these artworks are still ongoing today. Buddhism and Westernization (1945~present) Typical interior of a Buddhist temple When Korea was liberated by the surrender of Japan in 1945, the celibate monastics of what has become the largest sect of Korean Buddhism in terms of adherents and the number of clergy, the Jogye Order, began to take over for the married priests who ran the temples during the occupation.Chanju Mun (2007). Purification Buddhist Movement, 1954-62: The Recovery of Traditional Monasticism from Japanized Buddhism in South Korea, Hsi Lai Journal of Humanistic Buddhism (Ë•ø‰æÜ‰∫∫Èñì‰ΩõÊïôÂ≠∏Â†±) 8, 262-294 This order sees itself as the primary representative of traditional Korean Buddhism in existence. The Taego Order is the second largest order of Korean Buddhism and includes both celibate and married monks (nuns are expected to remain celibate). This is the only order that maintains the full Korean Buddhist ritual tradition. =South Korea= Starting in the 1950s, Syngman Rhee and others worked to further divide and weaken the Buddhist Sangha in the country. Rhee campaigned in 1954 against the so-called \\"Japanized Buddhists\\". Western education and scholarship, and the empowerment of women and the poor, caused divisions among Koreans. Specifically, a deep rift opened between married priests and celibate monks, a carryover from Japanese Buddhism's influence during the occupation period, though there had been calls for an end to celibacy from some Korean monks before Japan's annexation of the Korean peninsula. The differences were so great that fistfights over the control of temples became frequent. Monks, mostly belonging to the celibate Jogye order, threatened to kill themselves. Many of them were against the married clergy. As the Buddhist riots continued, the influence of Buddhism lessened. Buddhism continued to lose followers to Christian missionaries, who were able to capitalize on these weaknesses. From the 1960s onward, Buddhism has grown considerably, through the formation of independent lay associations (that is, not funded or affiliated to the main orders), with many focused on youths, particularly to propagate and evangelize Buddhist teachings, fellowship and spiritual development, based on the Protestant model. These adaptations have modernized Buddhism in South Korea. Moreover, the South Korean government began devoting substantial funds to restore and reconstruct historic Buddhist temples, helping to revive Buddhism in the country. President Park Chung-hee unsuccessfully attempted during his rule (1961-1979) to settle the dispute by building a pan-national Buddhist organization. However, he did succeed in allying himself with the celibate faction, the Jogye Order. It was in 1970 that Korean Buddhism split into a fully celibate order which retained the name \\"Jogye\\" and the Taego order that includes both celibate and married clergy. The Taego order retained the traditional red kasa whereas the Jogye order changed their kasa to brown to visually differentiate the two orders. Both orders continue to use the Dharmaguptaka Pratimoksha, the lineage of vows for monks and nuns taken in China and Vietnam, though Taego monks have the option of returning the vow of celibacy. When the Jogye order was founded, the government only recognized a small group of celibate Seon practitioners as \\"legitimate,\\" thus all of the ritual specialists remained with the Taego order. In the 1980s, President Chun Doo-hwan, a Methodist, adopted anti-Buddhist policies and attempted to restrict Buddhist activities. During his administration, many historic temples were converted into tourist resorts, which deprived temples of their autonomy, as these \\"national parks\\" were government-run. Consequently, Buddhists, especially the Jogye Order, were highly critical of these measures. From 27 to 31 October 1980, during the Kyeongsin Persecution, the government raided major Buddhist temples throughout the country, including the headquarters at Seoul's Jogyesa, under the guise of anti-government investigations and an attempt to \\"purify\\" Buddhism. 55 monks were arrested and many others were interrogated and tortured, including the abbot of Naksansa, who died from the abuses. None of the investigated monks were ever charged, although many were sent to reeducation camps. Throughout the 1980s, the Buddhist community was kept under strict surveillance of government agents and many were prosecuted under false charges of supporting Communists or conspiracy. To Buddhists, the construct of a state-protecting Buddhism (Ìò∏Íµ≠Î∂àÍµê or Ë≠∑Âúã‰ΩõÊïé, Hoguk Bulgyo) had vanished, which served to radicalize a generation of Buddhists, including monks and laity and propelled them to start a movement called Minjung Buddhism (ÎØºÏ§ëÎ∂àÍµê or Ê∞ëË°Ü‰ΩõÊïé, \\"practical Buddhism\\" or \\"Buddhism for the masses\\"). This modernization emphasized ordinary people and was a reaction to aggressive Christian proselytization in Korea. From the mid-1980s to date, Buddhism has expanded by through media and education. There are two major Buddhist media networks in South Korea, the Buddhist Broadcasting System (BBS), founded in 1990 and the Buddhist Cable TV Network, founded in 1995. Buddhist orders are also affiliated with or operate 3 universities, 26 schools and 16 seminaries in the country. The Kwan Um School of Zen is one of South Korea's most successful international missionary institutions. Lotus Lantern Festival During the 1990s, conflicts between the South Korean government and Buddhist leaders, as well as with fundamentalist Protestant denominations, continued. The government accused Buddhism of immorality and many Protestants used this to forward their missionary work. Some religious gatherings have even turned violent, vandalizing statues of Buddha and Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea. Soon after the Buddhist Broadcasting Service's FM radio station was launched in 1990, young men vandalized and destroyed sound facilities worth $200,000 USD. There was also a rash of temple burnings in the 1980s and 1990s, and attacks on Buddhist artwork have continued. In one instance, a Protestant minister used a microphone on a cord as a bolo weapon and smashed temple paintings and a statue. In other instances, red crosses have been painted on temple walls, murals, and statues. Buddha statues have also been decapitated. Furthermore, students at Buddhist universities report aggressive attempts to convert them on campus, especially near campus temples.See Frank Tedesco's \\"Questions for Buddhist and Christian Cooperation in Korea,\\" Buddhist- Christian Studies 17 (1997). On and off, sectarian tensions between fundamentalist Protestants and Buddhists occasionally rise due to what has been seen as a tendency of government officials-many of whom are Christians, especially of Protestant denominations-to tilt the political balance in favour of Christians over Buddhists which has led to discontent within the Buddhist community. Of particular note was after Lee Myung-bak's ascendence to the Presidency when the high proportion of Christians in relation to Buddhists in the public sector became known-particularly the president's cabinet, where there were 12 Christians to only one Buddhist. among other reported incidences. Recently, the South Korean public has become increasingly critical of Protestant churches and leaders attacking Buddhist institutions and carrying out aggressive missionary tactics, with many Protestants leaving their churches and converting to Buddhism.Crisis in the Church The growing discontent with Protestant Christianity in South Korea has contributed to a spiritual and cultural revival of Buddhism in South Korea, with the number of followers increasing in recent years.\\"Buddha's Birthday\\", Wall Street Journal, 2008 The presidency of Park Geun-hye aimed to help contribute to the suppression of Protestant attacks against Buddhists and Catholics in South Korea, with increasing calls for religious cooperation in the country under the administration. During the first year of the Park administration, a national message was delivered for the celebration of Buddha's Birthday, a contrast from the former Lee Myung-bak presidency which tried to suppress Buddhist influence in South Korea. = North Korea = Buddhist temple of Chongrungsa, near Pyongyang The regime in North Korea actively discourages the practice of religion, including Buddhism. Currently, the country claims to have about 10,000 active adherents of Buddhism. As with other religions in the country, Buddhism came under the close scrutiny of the country's governmentDemocratic People's Republic of Korea, U.S. Department of State- including worship at Buddhist temples by monks, through the state-sponsored Korea Buddhist Federation. A major temple is Pohyonsa which was preserved by Kim Il-Sung. Nevertheless, Buddhists in North Korea reportedly fared better than other religious groups-particularly Christians, who were said to often face persecution by the authorities, and Buddhists were given limited funding by the government to promote the religion, given that Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture. =Current situation= The Seon school, which is dominated by the Jogye Order in terms of the number of clergy and adherents, practices disciplined traditional Seon practice at a number of major mountain monasteries in Korea, often under the direction of highly regarded masters. The Taego Order, though it has more temples than the Jogye Order, is second in size in terms of the number of clergy and adherents and, in addition to Seon meditation, keeps traditional Buddhist arts alive, such as Yeongsanjae and other ritual dance. Modern Seon practice is not far removed in its content from the original practice of Jinul, who introduced the integrated combination of the practice of Gwanhwa meditation and the study of selected Buddhist texts. The Korean monastic life is markedly itinerant for monks and nuns pursuing Seon meditation training: while each monk or nun has a \\"home\\" monastery, he or she will regularly travel throughout the mountains, staying as long as he or she wishes, studying and teaching in the style of the temple that is housing them. The Korean monastic training system has seen a steadily increasing influx of Western practitioner-aspirants in the second half of the twentieth century. The vast majority of Korean monks and nuns do not spend 20 or 30 years in the mountains pursuing Seon training in a form recognizable to westerners. Most Korean monks and nuns receive a traditional academic education in addition to ritual training, which is not necessarily in a formal ritual training program. Those who do spend time in meditation in the mountains may do so for a few years and then essentially return to the life of a parish priest. Currently, Korean Buddhism is in a state of slow transition. While the reigning theory behind Korean Buddhism was based on Jinul's \\"sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation,\\" the modern Korean Seon master, Seongcheol's revival of Hui Neng's \\"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation\\" has taken Korean Buddhism by storm. Although there is resistance to change within the ranks of the Jogye order, with the last three Supreme Patriarchs' stance that is in accordance with Seongcheol, there has been a gradual change in the atmosphere of Korean Buddhism.  Antagonism from Korean Protestantism  Fundamentalist Protestant antagonism against Buddhism has increased in recent years. Acts of vandalism against Buddhist amenities and instances of fundamentalist Christians praying for the destruction of all Buddhist temples and monasteries have all drawn attention to this persistent hostility against Buddhism from Korean Protestants. South Korean Buddhists have denounced what they view as discriminatory measures against them and their religion by the administration of President Lee Myung-bak, which they attribute to Lee being a Protestant.Rahn, Kim (July 30, 2008). \\"President Embarrassed Over Angry Buddhists\\".

In 2006, according to the Asia Times, \\"Lee also sent a video prayer message to a Christian rally held in the southern city of Busan in which the worship leader prayed feverishly: 'Lord, let the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down!'\\" Further, according to an article in Buddhist-Christian Studies: \\"Over the course of the last decade a fairly large number of Buddhist temples in South Korea have been destroyed or damaged by fire by misguided Protestant fundamentalists. More recently, Buddhist statues have been identified as idols, attacked and decapitated. Arrests are hard to effect, as the arsonists and vandals work by stealth of night.\\"Harry L.

In October 2010, students from Church Equipping Worship School posted a clip on YouTube professing a hope that God would destroy a Buddhist temple in Seoul. Later they claimed being taught such by God. Following public outrages sparked by the video, pastor Choi Ji-ho and students from the school went to Bongeunsa Temple to apologize for the comments made by the student.

Swadhyaya is a self-study process based on the Bhagavad Gita which has spread across nearly 100,000 villages in India,Spiritualist from India is honored with religion's Templeton Prize The Seattle Times, 5 March 1997.Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice, by Robin Rinehart. Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004. . Page 375 with five million adherents.Year in Review ‚Äì 2003 ‚Äì Passages The Seattle Times, 29 December 2003. Noted for his discourses on the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Upanishads, Dadaji is also known for his selfless work and brilliant knowledge in scriptures. Early life Pandurang Vaijnath Athavale was born on 19 of October 1920 in Chitpavan Brahmin Family in the village of Roha in Maharashtra (Konkan), India. He was one of five children born to the Sanskrit teacher Vaijanath Shastri Athavale and his wife Parvati Athavale. When Athavale was twelve years old, his grandfather set up an independent course of study for the young boy. Thus, Athavale was taught in a system very similar to that of the Tapovan system of ancient India. In 1942, he started to give discourses at the Srimad Bhagavad Gita Pathshala, Madhavbaug, Mumbai\\", a center set up by his father in 1926. Athavale read diligently in the Royal Asiatic Library for a period of 14 years; at a young age, he was well-known to have read every piece of non- fiction literature (ranging from Marx's philosophy to Whitehead's writings to ancient Indian philosophy). In 1954, he attended the Second World Philosophers' Conference, held in Japan. There, Athavale presented the concepts of Vedic ideals and the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Many participants were impressed by his ideas but wanted evidence of such ideals being put into practice in India. Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist Dr. Arthur Holly Compton was particularly enchanted with Athavale's ideas and offered him a lucrative opportunity in the United States, where he could spread his ideas. Athavale politely declined,Biography Ramon Magsaysay Award website. saying that he had much to accomplish in his native India, where he planned to demonstrate to the world a model community peacefully practising and spreading Vedic thoughts and the message of the Bhagavad Gita. Swadhyaya Parivar Pandurang Shastri Athavale receiving the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, from Prince Philip at a public ceremony held in Westminster Abbey, 6 May 1997 Swadhyaya Parivar established itself in India in 1978 with adherents meeting every Sunday, where prayers were sung and a video recording of Athavale was played. Swadhyaya, which closely translates to \\"study of the self\\" is a process based upon Vedic philosophy, and the members of the Parivar are called \\"Swadhyayees\\". Over the years, Athavale's followers have taken the Bhagawad Gita's concepts of Indwelling God and God's universal love, to millions of people: transcending caste, socioeconomic barriers, and religious differences. Rev. Athavale personally visited tens of thousands of villages (on foot and rented bicycles), and his brothers and sisters (swadhyayees) went to every house personally and established a selfless relationship with each family and went house to house to spread Gita's thoughts. adherents have followed suit to roughly 100,000 villages across India, and at least 34 nations across the globe. Dadaji In these villages, Rev. Athavale started various experiments (Prayogs) to impart social activism by means of a god- centric devotion, including cooperative farming, fishing and tree-planting projects in the spirit of collective, divine labour (bhakti), somewhat similar to the Antigonish Movement in Canada. Swadhyayees aim to fulfill Rev. Athavale's vision of eradicating the world's problems by creating a global family united under the principle of a universal blood maker. He felt that the universality of the Bhagavad Gita allows for it to a guide to all of humanity. As such, it's thoughts should reach unto the last person. Today, the millions of adherents can be found on every habitable continent in over 35 countries including the Caribbean, Americas, Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and Africa. It is the Swadhyaya Parivar's mission to complete Rev. Athavale's vision of a \\"Universal Brotherhood under the Divine Fatherhood of God.\\"Leader of Spiritual Movement Wins $1.2 Million Religion Prize The New York Times, 6 March 1997.

Lehmann (who later became a major contributor to Punch). It was started as a periodical featuring student politics, badinage and literary efforts. The title was taken from the medieval name for the Cam, the river which runs through the town, but is now used only for two of that river's tributaries. An early editor of the magazine was R. P. Keigwin, the English cricketer and Danish scholar; in 1912‚Äì13 the editor was the poet, writer and reviewer Edward Shanks. In this form the magazine had a long and distinguished history. The magazine published juvenilia of several writers who later became well known, including: Geoffrey Gorer, William Empson,John Haffenden, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Michael Frayn, Ted Hughes, A. A. Milne J. P. C. Roach, \\"The University of Cambridge: The modern university (1882-1939)\\", in A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge (1959), pp. 266‚Äì306; and F.

Rebirth During the 1970s the publication, faced with financial difficulties and increasing levels of student apathy, was rescued by a group of interested postgraduates, including writer and producer Jonathan Levi, journalist Bill Buford, and Peter de Bolla (now Professor of Cultural History and Aesthetics at Cambridge University). In 1979, it was successfully relaunched as a magazine of \\"new writing\\", with both writers and audience drawn from the world beyond Cambridge. Bill Buford (who wrote Among the Thugs originally as a project for the journal) was the editor for its first 16 years in the new incarnation. Ian Jack succeeded him, editing Granta from 1995 until 2007. In April 2007, it was announced that Jason Cowley, editor of the Observer Sport Monthly, would succeed Jack as editor in September 2007. Cowley redesigned and relaunched the magazine; he also launched a new website. In September 2008, he left when he was selected as editor of the New Statesman. Alex Clark, a former deputy literary editor of The Observer, succeeded him as the first female editor of Granta.Stephen Brook \\"Granta names Alex Clark as first female editor\\", The Guardian, 28 May 2008. In late May 2009, Clark left the publication and John Freeman, the American editor, took over the magazine.Oliver Luft, \\"Alex Clark steps down as Granta editor\\", The Guardian, 29 May 2009. , Grantas circulation was almost 50,000.\\"Granta: A new chapter at the original literary journal \\", The Independent, 11 December 2006 (accessed 2 March 2007). Ownership In 1994, Rea Hederman, owner of The New York Review of Books, took a controlling stake in the magazine. In October 2005, control of the magazine was bought by Sigrid Rausing. Granta Books In 1989, then-editor Buford founded Granta Books. Granta's stated aim for its book publishing imprint is to publish work that \\"stimulates, inspires, addresses difficult questions, and examines intriguing periods of history.\\" Owner Sigrid Rausing has been vocal about her goal to maintain these standards for both the magazine and the book imprint, telling the Financial Times, \\"[Granta] will not publish any books that could not potentially be extracted in the magazine. We use the magazine as a yardstick for our books.... We are no longer going to look at what sells as a sort of argument, because it seemed to me that we were in danger of losing our inventiveness about what we wanted to do.\\"Isabel Berwick, \\"Lunch with the FT: Sigrid Rausing\\", The Financial Times, 6 November 2009. Authors recently published by Granta Books include Michael Collins, Simon Gray, Anna Funder, Tim Guest, Caspar Henderson, Louise Stern and Olga Tokarczuk. When Rausing purchased Granta, she brought with her the publisher Portobello Books.

Granta Best of Young British Novelists In 1983, Granta (issue #7) published a list of 20 young British novelists as names to watch out for in the future. Since then, the magazine has repeated its recognition of emerging writers in 1993 (issue #43), 2003 (issue #81) and 2013 (issue #123). In 1996 (issue #54), Granta published a similar list of promising young American novelists, which was repeated during 2007 (issue #97). In 2010 Granta issue #113 was devoted to the best young Spanish-language novelists. Many of the selections have been prescient. At least 12 of those identified have subsequently either won or been short-listed for major literary awards such as the Man Booker Prize and Whitbread Prize. The recognition of Adam Thirlwell\\"Lists, lists, lists...\\" New Writing Granta Magazine, 19 November 2010. and Monica Ali on the 2003 list was controversial, as neither had yet published a novel. Thirlwell's debut novel, Politics, later met with mixed reviews. Ali's Brick Lane was widely praised. Dan Rhodes contacted others on the 2003 list to try to persuade them to make a joint statement in protest against the Iraq War, which was gaining momentum at the time. Not all the writers responded. Rhodes was so disappointed he considered stopping writing, but has continued.3am Interview: \\"A SMALL BUT SATISFYING KICK IN BLAIR'S NUTS: AN INTERVIEW WITH DAN RHODES\\", 3 AM Magazine, July 2003, accessed 14 March 2013. =1983= *Martin Amis *William Boyd *Maggie Gee *Kazuo Ishiguro *Adam Mars-Jones *Salman Rushdie *Julian Barnes *Ursula Bentley *Pat Barker *Buchi Emecheta *Ian McEwan *Shiva Naipaul *Graham Swift *Rose Tremain *Clive Sinclair *Alan Judd *Philip Norman *A.

The word comes from French h√©ritier l√©gitime, meaning \\"rightful heir.\\" The legitime is usually a statutory fraction of the decedent's gross estate and passes as joint property to the decedent's next- of-kin in equal undivided shares. The legitime cannot be infringed in order to give a spouse or other beneficiary a greater share of the estate. Therefore, when a decedent has children and leaves a will, it is unlawful for the testator to override the legitime by special gift which exhausts the estate or by designating his spouse or other person as sole beneficiary. This is known as preterition when arising by omission and disinheritance when heirs are expressly deprived. English Common law In English common law, there is no legitime; the Statute of Wills, 32 Hen. VIII c. 1, provided for the unfettered distribution of a decedent's entire estate; a testator is entitled to disinherit any and all of his children, for any reason and for no reason. Most jurisdictions in the United States have enacted statutes that prohibit a testator from disinheriting a spouse, or provided that in the event of such a will the spouse may elect to \\"take against the will\\" and claim a statutory share of a decedent's estate. This is done as a substitute for the common law rights of dower and curtesy.  In certain jurisdictions  = Brazil = In Brazil, the descendants (alternatively, the parents or grandparents) and the spouse must receive at least 50% of it among themselves. = Czech Republic = In the Czech Republic, the nearest descendants can require 1/4 of their intestacy portion if they are of age or 3/4 of their intestacy portion if they are under age. (If a child of the deceased died before him, his children can claim forced share instead of him etc.) = Louisiana = In Louisiana, until the passing of Act No. 788 of 1989, the situation was different. Formerly, in Louisiana the legitime operated to prevent a parent from wholly disinheriting his children, who were and are still called forced heirs. If the decedent left issue in the form of one child, that issue must receive at least 25% of the decedent's estate. If there were two or more children, they must receive at least 50% of it among themselves. Similar provisions prevented a decedent with living parents from disinheriting them. Post-1989 Louisiana law provides for a forced share only if the decedent's children are under 24 years of age, or are permanently unable to take care of themselves, referred to as interdicted or subject to interdiction. Otherwise, a decedent's issue may be wholly disinherited. This change is essentially the importation of the common law doctrine of freedom of testation, but stops short of fully abolishing forced heirship because that is expressly forbidden by Louisiana Constitution Article XII, Section 5.Katherine Shaw Spaht, Kathryn Venturatos Lorio, Cynthia Picou, Cynthia Samuel, and Frederick W. Swaim Jr., ‚ÄúThe New Forced Heirship Legislation: A Regrettable ‚ÄòRevolution‚Äô‚Äù, in: Louisiana Law Review 50-3 (January 1990): 409-99. . = Scotland = In Scotland, legitim is the right of the issue (including adult issue) to not less than a defined share of the value of the moveable estate of the deceased. The share is one half, if the deceased left no relict (widow or widower), or one third if there was a relict. For example, if a testator has two children, and no spouse, and in her/his testament leaves everything to one of them, the other would be entitled to half of the legitim fund, which means a half of a half of the total net value of the moveable estate. (Or half of a third if there were a spouse.) Legitim is also called the bairn‚Äôs pairt or part of gear (Scots bairn ‚Äòchild‚Äô).D. R. Macdonald, Succession, 3rd edn (2001); Hilary Hiram, The Scots Law of Succession, 2nd edn (2007) = Philippines = Under the Civil Code of the Philippines, the legitime is given to and/or shared by the compulsory heirs of the decedent. This is also called compulsory succession because the law has reserved it for the compulsory heirs and thus, the testator has no power to give it away to anyone of his liking. The compulsory heirs include the children, or descendants (this class includes the adopted children and legitimated children), legitimate or illegitimate; in their default, the legitimate parents, or legitimate ascendants; the surviving spouse, which concurs with the foregoing classes; and the illegitimate parents. Thus, legitimate children always get one half of the estate, divided equally between them. The surviving spouse gets a share equal to that of a legitimate child, except when there is only one legitimate child, in which case he or she gets one fourth of the estate. Illegitimate children get one half of the share given to legitimate children. The legitimate parents or ascendants are excluded by legitimate children or descendants, but not by illegitimate children, and get one half of the estate in such cases. The surviving spouse or illegitimate children, when either concur with the parents or ascendants, get one fourth of the estate. If all concur, the share of the surviving spouse is reduced to one eighth of the estate. The surviving spouse gets one half of the estate when there are no other heirs, and in certain cases, when the marriage is in articulo mortis, he or she gets one third. The surviving spouse also gets one third of the estate when concurring with illegitimate children, who also get the same share. However, the surviving spouse gets one fourth when concurring with illegitimate parents, who also get one fourth of the estate. The illegitimate children, in default of everyone, get one half of the estate. The illegitimate parents, who are excluded by everyone except the surviving spouse, also get one half in default of everyone.

It came to an end with the reign of Michael the Brave (1593-1601) who managed, for a short time in 1600, to rule Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania, the three principalities whose territories were to be united some three centuries later to form Romania. Over most of this period, Banat, Cri≈üana, Maramure≈ü, and Transylvania ‚Äì now regions in Romania to the west of the Carpathian Mountains ‚Äì were part of the Kingdom of Hungary. They were divided into several types of administrative units, such as \\"counties\\" and \\"seats\\". The heads of the Transylvanian counties or \\"counts\\" were subordinated to a special royal official called voivode, but the province was seldom treated as a single unit, since the Sz√©kely and Saxon seats were administered separately. In the kingdom, Romanian peasants, being Orthodox, were exempt from the tithe, an ecclesiastical tax payable by all Roman Catholic commoners. However, Romanian noblemen slowly lost the ability to participate in political life, as the 14th-century monarchs pursued a zealous pro-Catholic policy. Their position became even worse after 1437 when the so- called \\"Union of Three Nations\\", an alliance of the Hungarian noblemen, the Sz√©kelys, and the Saxons, was formed in order to crush the Bob√¢lna peasant uprising. Wallachia, the first independent medieval state between the Carpathians and the lower Danube was created when Basarab I (' 1310-1352) terminated the suzerainty of the King of Hungary with his victory in the battle of Posada in 1330. The independence of Moldavia, to the east of the Carpathians, was achieved by Bogdan I (1359-1365), a nobleman from Maramure≈ü, who led a revolt against the former ruler who was appointed by the Hungarian monarch. The independence of the two principalities, however, was rarely secure, and vassalage to multiple states became an important aspect of their diplomacy. Although Wallachia paid tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417, and Moldavia from 1456, their two medieval monarchs, Mircea the Old of Wallachia (1386-1418) and Stephen the Great of Moldavia (1457-1504) conducted successful military operations against the Ottoman Turks. The two principalities' trade with other parts of Europe began to decrease after the last decades of the 15th century. Before this the sale of hides, grain, honey, and wax to the Holy Roman Empire, Venice, and Poland, and the import of silk, weapons and other manufactured goods from these areas had been widespread, but by the end of the 16th century the Ottoman Empire became the main market for Romanian products. Transylvania, together with the neighboring counties, gained the status of an autonomous state under Ottoman suzerainty after the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary had been annexed by the Ottomans in 1541. The fall of the kingdom also deprived Wallachia and Moldavia of their main ally in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. In 1594, Michael the Brave of Wallachia joined the anti-Ottoman alliance initiated by Pope Clement VIII. After a series of victory over the Ottomans, he turned against Transylvania and Moldavia where pro-Polish and pro-Ottoman princes were reigning. He invaded and occupied Transylvania in 1599, and Moldavia in 1600. Although the personal union of the three countries collapsed four months later, it served as an ideal for later generations working for the unification of the lands that now form Romania. Early Middle Ages At the end of the 8th century the establishment of the Khazar Khaganate north of the Caucasus Mountains created an obstacle in the path of nomadic people moving westward.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 52.Spinei 2009, pp. 47‚Äì49. In the following period, the local population of the Carpathian-Danubian area profited from the peaceful political climate and a unitary material culture, called \\"Dridu\\", that developed in the region.Spinei 2009, p. 50. Finds from the Dridu settlements, such as coulters and sickles, confirm the role of agriculture in their economy.Spinei 2009, p. 223. The Carpathian Mountains and the main rivers in modern Romania In the 9th century centrifugal movements commenced in the Khazar Kaghanate.Klepper 2002, p. 44. One of the subject peoples, the Hungarians left its dominion and settled in the region between the rivers Don and Dniester. They abandoned the steppes and crossed the Carpathians around 896. According to the 13th-century Gesta Hungarorum (\\"Deeds of the Hungarians\\"), at the time of the Hungarian invasion Transylvania was inhabited by Romanians and Slavs and ruled by Gelou, \\"a certain Romanian\\", while Cri≈üana was inhabited by several peoples, among them Sz√©kelys. Whether the author of the Gesta had any knowledge of the real conditions of the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries remains debated by historians.Spinei 2009, p. 75. In 953 the gyula, the second leader in rank of the Hungarian tribal federation, converted to Christianity in Constantinople. Around that time, according to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Hungarians controlled the region on the border of modern Romania and Hungary along the rivers Timi≈ü, Mure≈ü, Cri≈ü, Tisa and Toutis. In 1003, as the Annals of Hildesheim narrates, Stephen I, the first crowned monarch of Hungary (c. 1000-1038) \\"led an army against his maternal uncle, King Gyula\\", and occupied Gyula's country. Stephen I granted privileges to the Roman Catholic Church, for example by ordering the general imposition of the tithe upon the population.Sedlar 1994, p. 164. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count.Sedlar 1994, p. 275. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Cri≈üana remained in direct contact with the king who appointed and replaced them at will. From the end of the 9th century the Pechenegs controlled the territories to the east and south of the Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Bl√∂kkumen (\\"Romanians\\") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s.Spinei 2006, pp. 103‚Äì105. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078.Klepper 2005, p. 46. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ul√¢q (\\"Romanians\\"). Some of the Pechenegs fled into the Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.Sedlar 1994, p. 11. The 11th-century settlements in Transylvania are characterized by small huts with ceramic assemblages marked by clay cauldrons. The increasing number of coin finds suggests that the province experienced economic growth in the late 11th century. The first document pertaining to the province is a royal charter of 1075 referring to taxes on salt levied at Turda. The earliest precious metal mine in medieval Transylvania, the silver mine at Rodna was first mentioned in 1235. In the 12th and 13th centuries hospites (\\"guest settlers\\") arrived in Transylvania from Germany and from the French-speaking regions on the river Rhine who in time became collectively known as \\"Saxons\\".Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 62‚Äì63. In 1224 Andrew II of Hungary (1205-1235) granted special liberties to the Saxons who had settled in southern Transylvania. For instance, they were authorized to choose their local leaders; only the head of the entire community, the count of Sibiu, was appointed by the king. They were also granted the right to use \\"the forest of the Romanians and the Pechenegs\\". The first references to viniculture in Transylvania are connected to the vineyards of the hospites of CricƒÉu, Ighiu, and Romos. Ruins of the C√¢r»õa Monastery As a result of the Saxon immigration, the Sz√©kelys ‚Äì Hungarian-speaking free warriors cultivating communal lands ‚Äì were transferred to the southeast of the province.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 194.Sedlar 1994, pp. 92‚Äì93. From the 13th century they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Sz√©kelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at C√¢r»õa was established in the early 13th century, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land running up to the mountains between the rivers Olt, C√¢r≈£i≈üoara and Arpa≈ü be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery. Following the defeat of the Cumans by the Mongols on the river Kalka in 1223, some chieftains of the western Cuman tribes accepted the authority of the king of Hungary.Sedlar 1994, p. 211. Their conversion led to the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania to the east of the Carpathians.Spinei 2006, p. 154. However, the Orthodox Romanian population of the territory received the sacraments from \\"some pseudo-bishops of the Greek rite\\", according to a papal bull of 1234. Spinei 2006, pp. 154‚Äì155. In 1233 Oltenia was organized into a military frontier zone of the Kingdom of Hungary, called the Banate of Severin. The expansion across the Carpathians was stopped by the invasion of the Mongols that lasted from March 31, 1241 to April, 1242. It was a major watershed in the medieval history of the region: although the number of casualties is disputed, even the most prudent estimates do not go below 15 percent of the total population.  High Middle Ages (1242-1396)  = Outer-Carpathian regions = After the withdrawal from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Mongol forces halted at Sarai (now Russia) on the Volga River where their leader, Batu Khan set up his own capital.Sedlar 1994, p. 214. Henceforth, the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Danube were under the influence of the Mongols of the Volga, known as the Golden Horde.Sedlar 1994, p. 215.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 69. From the 1260s, a relative of Batu, Nogai Khan settled at Isaccea on the Lower Danube and became the absolute master of the neighboring regions.V√°s√°ry 2005, pp. 71‚Äì72. He made himself independent of the Golden Horde around 1280, but was killed in a battle in 1299.V√°s√°ry 2005, pp. 91‚Äì92., 161. By the middle of the 14th century, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to frequent Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated farther into the territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done.Sedlar 1994, p. 380. He won a major victory over the united Mongol troops on the Dnieper near the Black Sea in 1363.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 164. = Intra-Carpathian regions = Romanian Orthodox church at Densu≈ü The domains of Ladislaus K√°n and other oligarchs in the Kingdom of Hungary in the early 14th century Ladislaus K√°n's fortress at Deva Saxon seats in Transylvania Having been raided twice by the Mongols within a single year, Transylvania felt the consequences of the invasion of 1241-1242 for more than two decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de BaltƒÉ, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighi≈üoara and Media»ô; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned. Since only castles built of stone and walled towns had been able to resist Mongol attacks, following the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications.Sedlar 1994, p. 118. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Ungura≈ü. The process of urbanization was characterized by the predominance of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city- like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters. In 1257, B√©la IV of Hungary (1235-1270) appointed his eldest son, the future Stephen V (1270-1272) to govern the kingdom's territories to the east of the Danube. Here the younger king ceded a significant part of his royal domains to noblemen. The first years of the reign of Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1272-1290), were characterized by civil wars throughout the entire kingdom.Sedlar 1994, p. 287. In Transylvania, the Saxons engaged in a local conflict with the bishop, took Alba Iulia and set fire to the cathedral. The series of wars continued in 1285 with a second Mongol invasion. During its initial stage, the Sz√©kelys, the Romanians and the Saxons successfully blocked the Mongols' access and later organized a series of ambushes provoking panic among the retreating invaders. By that time, the Romanians' military role had expanded from their original task of defending the kingdom's frontiers. They participated in several military campaigns, for example against Bohemia in 1260 and against Austria in 1291. Their economic role became also recognized, since their pastoral activities connected to cloth production of the Saxon settlements. To the monarchs, they paid a special tax in sheep, called the \\"fiftieth\\". Andrew III of Hungary (1290-1301) even ordered, in 1293, that all the Romanians who had been settled without royal permission on noble domains be returned to the royal estate of Armeni. In the last decades of the 13th century, congregatio generalis (\\"general assembly\\") convoked by the monarchs or their representatives became an important organ of court system. For instance, the general assembly convoked in 1279 by Ladislaus IV for seven counties ‚Äì among them Bihor, Crasna, SƒÉtmar, and ZƒÉrand in the territory what is now Romania ‚Äì ended with sentencing a despotic person to death. The first charter referring to a general assembly of the Transylvanian counties was recorded in 1288. A general assembly of the Transylvanian nobles, Saxons, Sz√©kelys and Romanians was convoked personally by the monarch in 1291. When Andrew III died in 1301, the entire kingdom was in the hands of a dozen powerful noblemen. Among them, Roland Borsa ruled Cri≈üana, Theodore Vejtehi gained the upper hand in the Banat, and Ladislaus K√°n governed Transylvania.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 149. The latter's authority was also recognized by the Saxons and the Sz√©kelys. He even assumed royal prerogatives, such as taking over lands lacking rightful owners. After 1310, he acknowledged Charles I of Hungary (1301-1342) as his sovereign, but in fact continued to rule independently. The king who transferred his residence to Timi»ôoara in 1315 could only strengthen his authority after a long series of confrontations. For instance, Ciceu, the last stronghold of Ladislaus K√°n's sons surrendered in 1321. After the king's victory, one of his loyal adherents, Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi was appointed voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In appreciation of the Transylvanian noblemen's services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes they had so far paid to the voivodes. In this period, one of the major incentives for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Bra≈üov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany.Sedlar 1994, p. 356. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Bra≈üov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey. In the 14th century, the name \\"district\\" was generalized for the forms of territorial organizations of the Romanians, but only few of them, for instance their district in Bereg County (now in Hungary and Ukraine), achieved official recognition. Maramure≈ü, where Romanians were first mentioned in 1326, was the only district that transformed, around 1380, into a county. Louis I of Hungary (1342-1382) issued a royal decree in 1366 which prescribed firm judicial measures against \\"the malefactors of any nation, especially Romanians\\". Louis I's decree also regulated the legal status of the knezes, the Romanians' local leaders, by establishing a distinction between knezes \\"brought to\\" their lands by royal writ whose testimony in court weighed like that of nobles (\\"noble knezes\\"), and others whose evidence counted for less (\\"commoner knezes\\").Sedlar 1994, p. 64. This distinction, however, did not mean real nobility and grant them exemption from royal taxes, even for the noble knezes. Their status corresponded to that of the Hungarian \\"conditional nobles\\" whose nobility depended on the specified military services they were to render. According to a royal decree of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted land in the Sebe≈ü district of Timi≈ü county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 77. For example, the members of the powerful Dr√°gffy family turned Catholic in the 15th century. The Ottomans raided Transylvania for the first time in 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (1387-1437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 148. = Establishment of Wallachia = According to a charter issued by B√©la IV of Hungary for the Knights Hospitallers in 1247, at that time at least four polities existed in the area to the south of the Carpathians. Two of them, the cnezats of John and Farca≈ü were granted to the knights, but the lands ruled by Litovoi and Seneslau were left \\"to the Olati\\" (\\"Romanians\\") \\"just as they have owned it\\".V√°s√°ry 2005, pp. 146‚Äì147. In the 1270s, Litovoi extended his territory and stopped paying tribute to the king, but his army was defeated by the royal forces, and he was killed in the battle.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 65. The Battle of Posada in the Vienna Illustrated Chronicle Romanian historical tradition associates the foundation of Wallachia with the \\"dismounting of Radu Negru\\" who crossed the Carpathians from Transylvania accompanied by \\"Romanians, papists, Saxons, and all kind of men\\" around 1290. The first sovereign of Wallachia recorded in contemporary sources was Basarab I who obtained international recognition for the independence of the principality by his victory over Charles I of Hungary in the battle of Posada on November 12, 1330.Klepper 2002, p. 52. The princes of Wallachia were chosen from among his descendants ‚Äì either legitimate, or not ‚Äì by an assembly of the boyars until the 16th century.Sedlar 1994, p. 32.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 39. The boyars, members of the landed nobility, formed the most important social group in the principality.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 76. The vast majority of the population was formed by peasants who were called several names, such as vecini (\\"neighbors\\") or rum√¢ni (\\"Romanians\\"), in medieval documents. In this period, animals, especially sheep, remained the main item of export, but from the Wallachian Plain great quantities of grain were transported to the Mediterranean area. The basis of the peasants' diet was formed by millet eaten as porridge, while the boyars also used wheat. The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Wallachia was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1359. Wallachia issued its own currency under Vladislav I (1364-c. 1377). The earliest written information about Gypsies in modern Romania, a deed issued by Dan I of Wallachia (c. 1383-1386) refers to Vladislav I's former donation of Gypsies to the Vodi≈£a monastery. Later on, all the important monasteries and boyars owned Gipsy slaves.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 104. The Ottomans entered for the first time into Wallachia in 1395.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 99. Although the invading troops were defeated somewhere in a rovinƒÉ (\\"ragged marshland\\") in Oltenia, the chaos created by the threat of attacks allowed a group of boyars to put Vlad I the Usurper (1395-1397) on the throne. Thus Mircea I was forced to take refuge in Transylvania, where he agreed to be Sigismund I of Hungary's vassal.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 176. He was restored to the throne and participated in the disastrous crusade of Nicopolis organized by Sigismund I. = Establishment of Moldavia = After 1241 the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester was controlled by the Golden Horde. Nevertheless, the contemporary Thomas Tuscus's reference to the Romanians' conflict with the Ruthenians in 1277 suggests that Romanian political entities existed in northern Moldavia at that time.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 69. In 1345 Andrew Lackfi, the count of the Sz√©kelys led an army over the Carpathians and occupied this region where a border province was organized by Louis I of Hungary. Fortress at Neam≈£ Romanian historical tradition links the foundation of Moldavia to the \\"dismounting of Drago≈ü\\", a Romanian voivode from Maramure≈ü.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 88. Although Drago≈ü was succeeded by his son, Sas, his line did not last long.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. li. His descendants were soon expelled by Bogdan, a former voivode of Maramure≈ü who fled to Moldavia and joined with local boyars in a revolt.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 156.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 72. In Moldavia, agriculture and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The establishment of the principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Mu≈üat (c. 1375-1391). The succession to the throne, similarly to Wallachia, was governed by the hereditary-elective principle.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 83. Thus either a legitimate or an illegitimate member of the Mu≈üatin family could be proclaimed prince by an assembly of the boyars. In 1387 Peter I Mu≈üat recognized W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland as his suzerain, but Hungary also maintained its claim of suzerainty over the principality. Treptow et al. 1997, p. 70. Therefore, the princes of Moldavia could counterbalance the influence of Poland and Hungary by playing one off against the other. = Dobruja = After 1242 most of the territory between the Danube and the Black Sea was included in the area dominated by the Mongols. Although the Byzantine Empire reestablished control over the Danube Delta in the 1260s, it fell again under the direct rule of the Golden Horde sometime before 1337.V√°s√°ry 2005, p. 161. By the end of the 13th century, flourishing communities of Genoese merchants had settled in the towns of Vicina, Chilia and Licostomo. Towards the middle of the 14th century a state dependent of the Byzantine Empire, known as \\"the country of Cavarna\\", developed in the region. Its first known ruler was Balica. He was succeeded by his brother, Dobrotitsa, for whom part of his holdings, Dobruja, received its name. In about 1385 Ivanco became the ruler of the territory, but he soon disappeared during an Ottoman expedition. Dobruja was occupied by Mircea I of Wallachia in 1390 and by the Ottomans in 1395.  Towards Ottoman domination (1397-1529)  = Intra-Carpathian regions = Fortified Saxon church at Cristian, Sibiu In order to establish a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazareviƒá of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü. Sigismund I was also the first monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that in case of an Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an annual basis. In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Sz√©kely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance. The increasing defense costs fell primarily on the serfs: the rent on the land was raised and extraordinary taxes were imposed. The first peasant revolt in the territory of modern Romania broke out due to the efforts taken by the bishop of Transylvania to collect the church taxes.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 79. Led by Anton Budai Nagy, the rebellious peasants, who called themselves \\"the commune of the rightful Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants of this part of Transylvania\\", established a fortified camp on the Bob√¢lna hill early in 1437.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 44. They fought two important battles against the noblemen; the first one, at Bob√¢lna, was won by the peasants, and the second one, near the Apatiu River, had no clear winner. The leaders of the noblemen, the Saxons and the Sz√©kelys, however, set up a \\"brotherly union\\" in order to join forces and crushed the peasants' resistance by the end of January 1438. The Ottomans' attempt to conquer new territories led to a better organized policy against them. The temporary union of the Eastern and Western Churches proclaimed by the Council of Florence in 1439 also created a favorable background for the concentration of Christian forces.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 109‚Äì110. Christendom found its champion in John Hunyadi who gained a series of victories over the Ottomans after 1441.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 111. For instance, in 1442 he routed an Ottoman army that had been devastating Transylvania. Through his last victory over Mehmed II at the siege of Belgrade (in modern Serbia) in 1456, he saved the kingdom from Ottoman occupation for several decades. During the reign of his son, Matthias I of Hungary (1458-1490), the Ottomans launched only one serious attack against Transylvania in 1479 when they were defeated at C√¢mpul P√¢inii. Matthias I used his officials to assert royal prerogatives that had already fallen into disuse.Sedlar 1994, p. 272. The noblemen found it particularly irksome that the lucrum camarae, a tax from which they had been exempted was replaced with a new tax. In Transylvania, the \\"Three Nations\\" entered into a formal alliance against the king in 1467, but he quickly intervened and took the disorganized rebels by surprise. By that time, the land once held in common by the Sz√©kely community had gradually become divided into smaller and smaller units; thus a vast number of the free warrior- peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Sz√©kelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude. The prominence of the German element in the towns sometimes led to conflicts along ethnic lines.Sedlar 1994, p. 410. Thus the struggle for leadership in Cluj (now Cluj-Napoca) between Hungarians and Saxons only came to an end in 1458 by establishing a rule that municipal offices must be shared equally between the two groups. In 1486, Matthias I united all the Saxon districts in Transylvania in the \\"University of the Saxons\\" under the leadership of the elected mayor of Sibiu. After Matthias I's death, the assembly of the Estates, called Diet, began to function as a regular organ of power. The peasantry suffered most from the rule of the Estates, for instance, by the limitation of their right to free movement. In 1514 thousands of peasants who had been summoned to Buda (now Budapest, in modern Hungary) to join the crusade proclaimed by Pope Leo X against the Ottomans turned the weapons against their masters. The rebels, led by the Sz√©kely George D√≥zsa, occupied several towns, such as Oradea and ≈ûoimo≈ü, but on July 15 John Szapolyai, the voivode defeated them at Timi»ôoara. As a retaliation, the Diet decreed that peasants were to be tied to the land \\"perpetually\\".Sedlar 1994, p.320. The downfall of the Kingdom of Hungary was marked by the battle of Moh√°cs (Hungary) where the royal army was annihilated by the Ottomans on August 29, 1526.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. xvii.Klepper 2002, p. 61. Thereafter the noblemen's political factions engaged in conflict and elected two kings. One of them, John I Szapolyai (1526-1540) was supported by the lesser nobility, while Ferdinand I of Habsburg (1526-1564) was recognized mainly in the kingdom's western counties, but the Transylvanian Saxons also supported him. Seeking the assistance of the Ottomans, John I had to pay homage to the sultan at Moh√°cs in 1529. = Wallachia = Wallachia (c. 1404) After the battle of Nicopolis, the Ottomans occupied Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 by taking advantage of the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in the battle of Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 100. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de AramƒÉ. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of BuzƒÉu. After Mircea I's death, princes succeeded one another on the throne with devastating frequency. For instance, Michael I (1418-1420) was overthrown by his cousin, Dan II (1420-1431), and in the next decade the throne was occupied with frequent changes either by Dan II or by his cousin, Radu II the Bald (1421-1427), the former being supported by Sigismund I of Hungary and the latter by the Ottomans.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 101.Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. xlvii‚Äìxlviii. Alexander I Aldea (1431-1436) was the first Romanian ruler to be forced to render military service to the Ottomans.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 105. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 1456-1462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire.Sedlar 1994, p. 56.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. xlviii. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 1461-1462.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 215. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (1462-1475).Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. xlviii., 215. Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated after the end of the 14th century. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans. After 1462 Wallachia preserved its autonomy mainly through the intervention of Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At the end of the century, however, Radu IV the Great (1495-1508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craiove≈üti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (1512-1521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 147. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions. Under Theodosius I (1521-1522) the Ottoman governor of Nicopolis take advantage of the internal fights among the boyar parties, and thus dominated the political life of Wallachia. Due to the imminent danger of annexation, the boyars grouped around Radu V of Afuma≈£i (1522-1529) who fought about 20 battles against the Ottomans.Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. xlviii-xlvix. Finally, he was, in 1525, forced to accept Ottoman suzerainty and the rise of the tribute. = Moldavia = The Orthodox Metropolitan See of Moldavia was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarch during the reign of Alexander I the Good (1400-1432).Treptow, Popa 1996, p. 24. He reinforced Moldavia's traditional pro-Polish orientation and declared himself a vassal of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II of Poland in 1406. Thenceforth, the Moldavian armies fought together with the Poles against the Teutonic Knights. The first Ottoman attack on Moldavia in 1420 was also repulsed by him.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 109. Alexander I's death was followed by a long period of political instability, characterized by frequent fights for the throne. For instance, the struggle of his sons, Ilia≈ü I (1432-1442) and Stephen II (1433-1447) ended in 1435 by the division of the country.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. lii. Although cottage industries, both in boyar and peasant households, were still the main source of clothing, food and construction, specialized production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop by the middle of the 15th century. The first oil wells went into production in 1440, but their oil was also only for household use. In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy families to the Bistri≈£a Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was an occupation reserved almost exclusively for them. Peter III Aaron (1451-1457) was the first prince who agreed to pay tribute to the Ottomans in 1456. He was ousted by his nephew, Stephen, with the support of Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 115. Stephen III the Great was to be the most important medieval Romanian monarch who managed to uphold Moldavia's autonomy against Hungary, Poland and the Ottoman Empire.Sedlar 1994, p. 396. Europe around 1470 In the early years of his reign, he remained allied with Poland and the Ottoman Empire, and even joined the Ottomans in attacking Wallachia. He also supported the rebellion of 1467 of the Transylvanian Estates; therefore Matthias I of Hungary launched an expedition against Moldavia, but the royal army was defeated in the battle of Baia. He came to view the Ottoman Empire as his chief enemy in the 1470s, and in 1474 he refused to pay tribute.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 116. He soon received the ultimatum of Mehmed II who demanded the surrender of Chilia, a fortress recently captured from Wallachia. Upon Stephen III's refusal, a large Ottoman army was sent against Moldavia. He called on Pope Sixtus IV, pleading for a crusade. Although the pope acknowledged his merits, by naming him \\"the Athlete of Christ\\", no anti-Ottoman coalition materialized. Even without external military support, Stephen the Great led his troops to victory in the battle of Vaslui on January 10, 1475. Following the battle, he addressed a letter to the Christian princes, expressing the idea that the two Romanian principalities were the \\"gateway to the Christian world\\", and if they fell \\"all Christendom would be in danger\\". He also recognized Matthias I of Hungary as his suzerain and received, in return, Ciceu and Cetatea de BaltƒÉ in Transylvania. The following year, however, he found himself alone when Mehmed II invaded Moldavia. The Moldavian army was defeated in the Battle of Valea AlbƒÉ, but the Ottomans, suffering from a lack of provisions and an outbreak of the plague, were forced to retreat.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 116‚Äì117. Stephen the Great suffered the greatest setback of his reign in 1484 when the Ottomans captured Chilia and Cetatea Alba (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Ukraine) on the Black Sea. Having tried unsuccessfully to regain the fortresses in 1485, he concluded a peace with the sultan and agreed to pay tribute to him. He was succeeded by his son, Bogdan III the One-Eyed (1504-1517) whose reign was troubled by a long series of military conflicts with Poland and Wallachia. The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (1517-1527). His successor, Peter IV Rare≈ü (1527-1538, 1541-1546) intervened in the struggle for the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Sz√©kely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I's partisans.  Ottoman suzerainty (1530-1594)  = Establishment of Principality of Transylvania = After 1529, resistance to John I in Transylvania was broken in a series of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdin√°nd I, Stephen Majl√°th went over to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession. Suleiman I receiving Queen Isabella and her infant son at Buda (1541) However, John I married a daughter of Sigismund I of Poland, Isabella, who in 1540 bore him a son. Already dying, the king took an oath from his barons to evade the treaty of Oradea, and his counselor, George Martinuzzi, had the infant John II Sigismund elected as king (1540-1571). Ferdinand I sent troops to take Buda, but they withdrew upon the advance of the Ottoman army. On August 29, 1541 Suleiman I summoned the Hungarian lords to his camp, and while the reception was taking place, his troops occupied the capital of the kingdom. At the same time the sultan assigned the territories of the kingdom east of the Tisa to Queen Isabella and her son in return for an annual tribute. On October 18, the kingdom's eastern territories, including Transylvania, swore allegiance to the infant king at the Diet of Debrecen (Hungary). Thus a separate country started to emerge, although George Martinuzzi was still negotiating with Ferdinand I on the reunification of the kingdom. For this purpose, in 1551 Ferdinand I sent an army into Transylvania where he was recognized as sole ruler by the Diet. The Ottomans, however, occupied a great part of Banat in 1552, and neither could Ferdinand I consolidate his rule over the kingdom's eastern territories. Finally, the Diet, meeting in Sebe≈ü on March 12, 1556, swore again allegiance to \\"the son of King John\\", thus the young king and his mother returned to Transylvania. The 16th century also brought about major religious changes: the Saxons converted to Lutheranism, while most of the Hungarians converted to Calvinism or Unitarianism; only the Sz√©kelys remained more than the other \\"nations\\" Catholic. In 1568, the Transylvanian Diet at Torda decreed the free worship of these four \\"received denominations\\", but Orthodoxy still continued to be only tolerated. The Romanians' status worsened in this period.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 134. The Diets of 1554 and 1555 decided that a Catholic or Protestant peasant could not be accused of a crime except there were seven Catholic or Protestant witnesses against him, while an Orthodox peasant could be accused if there were three Catholic or Protestant or seven Orthodox witnesses. The Diet of 1559 also decreed that Romanians who had settled on lands abandoned by Catholic serfs were obliged to pay the tithe. Evangelical Church in Sibiu From the Sz√©kelys, continuing warfare demanded increased military service, and the royal administration imposed special taxes on them. Although the leaders of the Sz√©kely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to be taxed, resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Sz√©kelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 128. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly as a consequence of the Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns. In the Treaty of Speyer of August 16, 1570, John II Sigismund acknowledged his rival, Maximilian I (1564-1576) as the lawful king of Hungary and adopted the title of \\"prince of Transylvania and parts of the Kingdom of Hungary\\". The treaty also marked out the borders of the new principality, which included not only the historical province of Transylvania, but also some neighboring counties, such as Bihor and Maramure≈ü, thenceforward collectively known as Partium. The death of John II Sigismund in 1571 threatened to throw the country again into the hands of the Habsburgs whose officers supported the Unitarian G√°sp√°r Bekes. Now the sultan appointed Stephen B√°thory, a Catholic politician, voivode. The decisive battle between the two candidates was won by Stephen B√°thory at S√¢npaul on July 8, 1575. In the same year, he was elected king of Poland, thus a personal union was formed between the two countries that lasted until his death in 1586. He left the administration of the principality first to his brother, Christopher B√°thory (1575-1581), and then to his brother's minor son, Sigismund B√°thory (1581-1602), bestowing on them the title of voivode, while he himself took the title of prince.Treptow, Popa 1996, p. lix. In February, 1594 Sigismund B√°thory announced that his country would join the anti-Ottoman alliance formed by the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II, Philip II of Spain and many smaller Italian and German states. Although the Estates twice refused to endorse the declaration of war, Transylvania joined the alliance on January 28, 1595 after the leaders of the opposition had been executed on the order of the monarch. In return Rudolph II recognized Sigismund's title of prince. = Wallachia = The short and unworthy reigns of Radu V‚Äôs successors only increased the crisis of Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (1545-1559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered.Klepper 2002, p. 69. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne with the support of some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 143. He soon embarked upon a program to strengthen the central authority by replacing the members of the sfatul domnesc, an advisory body consisting of boyars, with dregƒÉtori, that is officials personally loyal to him.Treptow, Popa 1996, pp. 91., 130., 181. Michael the Brave also adopted an anti-Ottoman policy, and upon his initiative Sigismund B√°thory of Transylvania and Aaron the Tyrant of Moldavia (1591-1595) signed a treaty to form an anti-Ottoman alliance. The rebellion started by the massacre of all the Ottomans in Wallachia on November 13, 1594. = Moldavia = In 1531 Peter IV Rare≈ü invaded Poland in order to reoccupy the Pocu≈£ia region (in modern Ukraine), but his army was defeated. Now he concluded a secret treaty with Ferdinand I of Hungary, but soon had to seek refugee in Transylvania when Suleiman I led an army against him. This was the first occasion when a prince, Stephen V LƒÉcustƒÉ (1538-1540) was appointed by the sultan. At the same time, the sultan occupied BrƒÉila and Tighina (now in Moldova), and the Budjak region (now in Ukraine). Peter IV Rare≈ü recovered his throne in exchange for a large sum of money in 1541. His death was followed by a period characterized by fights between pretenders to the throne and among the boyar parties. The idea of anti-Ottoman struggle was revived by John III the Terrible (1572-1574) who refused to pay the tribute to the sultan.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 130. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jili≈üte. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured and quartered.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 130‚Äì131. Next Aaron the Tyrant joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia. The 16th century was characterized by the flourishing of ecclesiastical mural painting whose technique have remained a secret until today. For example, the interior and exterior frescoes of the Vorone≈£ Monastery represent this \\"Moldavian style\\".  Age of Michael the Brave (1595-1601)  Michael the Brave Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia in 1600 Following their coordinated uprising, Michael the Brave attacked Ottoman strongholds along the Danube and recovered Giurgiu and BrƒÉila, while Aaron the Tyrant seized Ismail (now in Ukraine).Treptow et al. 1997, pp 143‚Äì144. In response, the sultan ordered the Grand Vizier, Sinan Pasha to invade Wallachia.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 144. The two princes needed the support of Sigismund B√°thory who took advantage of the situation to make himself suzerain of Wallachia and Moldavia. When Aaron the Tyrant refused Sigismund B√°thory's conditions, he was replaced by the latter's prot√©g√©, ≈ûtefan RƒÉzvan (1595) on the throne. According to the treaty signed by Michael the Brave on May 20, 1595 in Alba Iulia, Sigismund B√°thory became the ruler of the three principalities and adopted the title of \\"prince of Transylvania, Moldavia and Transalpine Wallachia\\". The treaty stipulated, that the taxes would be established in Wallachia by the Transylvanian Diet, together with a council of 12 Wallachian boyars. Around that time, the peasants were bound to the land both in Wallachia and Moldavia. Ottoman troops entered Wallachia in the summer, but they were defeated by Michael the Brave at CƒÉlugƒÉreni and by the united armies of the three principalities at Giurgiu.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 144‚Äì145. In the meantime, however, the Poles had invaded Moldavia and replaced ≈ûtefan RƒÉzvan by Ieremia MovilƒÉ (1595-1606).Klepper 2002, p. 79. In June 1598 Michael the Brave recognized the suzerainty of Emperor Rudolph II, who had promised to grant subsidies to him to finance his mercenaries. On March 30, 1599 Sigismund B√°thory abdicated the throne in favor of his cousin, Andrew B√°thory (1599).Treptow et al. 1997, p. 147. The new prince was loyal to the Poles and promptly demanded that Michael the Brave accept his suzerainty. The latter secured the emperor's approval for an invasion of Transylvania and attacked the principality where the Sz√©kelys also joined him. He defeated his opponent at ≈ûelimbar on October 28, 1599 and entered Alba Iulia. Here the Diet recognized him as imperial governor. He respected the traditional organization of Transylvania, and even crushed a revolt of the Romanian peasants, but forced the Diet to relieve the Orthodox priests of feudal obligations.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 148. In the spring of 1600, he invaded Moldavia in the name of the emperor and established control over it.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 149‚Äì150. In July he even proclaimed himself \\"prince of Wallachia, Transylvania, and all of Moldavia\\" in Ia≈üi, thus bringing about the union of the three principalities.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 150. However, the Hungarian noblemen, dissatisfied with the disorder, rebelled against his rule, and defeated him at MirƒÉslƒÉu on September 18, 1600. At the same time, the Poles invaded Moldavia and restored Ieremia MovilƒÉ to the throne; then they entered Wallachia, where Simion MovilƒÉ defeated Michael the Brave at BuzƒÉu.Treptow et al. 1997, pp. 150‚Äì151. In this moment of crisis, Michael the Brave left for Prague to appeal to the emperor for support.Treptow et al. 1997, p. 151. He returned to Transylvania in July 1601 at the head of an imperial army. Cooperating with the imperial general, Giorgio Basta, he defeated the Transylvanian troops at GuruslƒÉu on August 3, but on August 19 he was assassinated on the order of his former ally, Giorgio Basta.  After the first union  After Michael the Brave's death, Transylvania was ruled by an imperial military commission, but under Stephen Bocskay (1604-1606) the principality voluntarily accepted Ottoman suzerainty.Klepper 2002, p. 84. In the next decades, the princes of Transylvania, among them Gabriel Bethlen (1613-1629), made several unsuccessful attempts to unify Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia.Klepper 2002, pp. 84‚Äì85. Wallachia and Moldavia fell back under the control of the Ottoman Empire after Michael the Brave's death.Klepper 2002, p. 89. Radu Mihnea, prince of Wallachia (1611-1616, 1623-1626) and of Moldavia (1616-1623), was the first ruler to appoint Greeks from the Phanar district of Istanbul to high government posts. This started a trend that ultimately led to the so-called \\"Phanariot period\\" in Romania‚Äôs history.

He belonged to the junior (or \\"Popolani\\") branch of the House of Medici of Florence. Biography Lorenzo was born in Florence, the son of Pierfrancesco de' Medici (the Elder) and Laudomia Acciaioli. Relations between the senior Medici branch and the younger \\"Popolani\\" branch had been tense since the 1440s, and Pierfrancesco had tried to shield his sons from the influence of the senior branch.Brown, A. (1993) The Medici in Florence: the exercise and language of power. Florence: Olschki But Lorenzo and Giovanni were still boys when their father Pierfrancesco died in 1476, and they promptly came under the tutelage of their older cousin, Lorenzo (il Magnifico), the effective ruler of Florence. Facing financial difficulties after 1478, Lorenzo il Magnifico plundered the Popolani boys' inheritance with \\"forced loans\\". By the time they came of age, they claimed Lorenzo il Magnifico owed them over 100,000 ducats (il Magnifico eventually repaid a little over half of that in 1485). Nonetheless, Lorenzo il Magnifico ensured his ward obtained the best education that could be bought at the time. Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco studied under notable Florentine Renaissance humanists Marsilio Ficino, Angelo Poliziano and Giorgio Antonio Vespucci (uncle of the navigator Amerigo Vespucci; Amerigo was a fellow-student and, from the 1483, became an employee and friend of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco; in the early 1500s, Amerigo Vespucci would send most of his famous letters on the \\"New World\\" to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco emerged with the reputation as a man of liberal views, a poet and art connoisseur in his own right. In ca. 1485, he commissioned an illuminated manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy featuring artwork by Botticelli. Pallas Athene Taming a Centaur. Allegory of Spring. The Birth of Venus. In 1482, Lorenzo il Magnifico arranged for the marriage between the young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and Semiramide Appiano, daughter of the Appiani lord Jacopo III of Piombino, who brought not only lucrative commercial ties but also political connections (the Appiani were related by marriage to the Aragonese of Naples). Lorenzo il Magnifico may have commissioned Sandro Botticelli's Pallas Athene Taming a Centaur as a wedding gift to the new couple, presumably suggesting that Semiramide (represented by Pallas) should endeavour to \\"tame\\" young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco (represented by centaur) (or more metaphorically, the surrender of brute instincts to the goddess of reason, a reference to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's entrance to manhood). It is believed that also on this occasion, either Lorenzo il Magnifico or Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco himself, commissioned Botticelli's Allegory of Spring to celebrate the wedding - with Mercury representing Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and Semiramide represented by the central Grace (or possibly Flora). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is believed to have later commissioned Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, one of the most famous paintings of the Renaissance. Lorenzo di Pierfranceso was the proprietor of the Villa del Trebbio, inherited from his grandfather Lorenzo the Elder, and Villa di Castello, acquired in 1477 on the instructions of Lorenzo il Magnifico. In 1483, he was dispatched as the Florentine ambassador to Paris, to witness the coronation of Charles VIII of France. Quarrels over the inheritance lingered. The rupture with Lorenzo il Magnifico came to a head in October 1484, when the strongman secured the erasure of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's name from the lists of persons eligible for election to the Florentine political institutions. As part of the settlement in 1485, which involved outside arbitration, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni il Popolano received the Medici family property of Villa Cafaggiolo in the Mugello region. Nonetheless, it was clear that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco would have to shelve any public office or political ambitions during il Magnifico's rule. When Lorenzo il Magnifico died (1492), Lorenzo and Giovanni sided against the il Magnifico's son, Piero (il Fatuo). Two years later they were exiled, but returned when King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and Piero was ousted from Florence by a Republican government. The two brothers sided with the Republican party, and received the nickname Popolano (\\"of the people\\"). Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco became one of the most outstanding figures of the new administration, and was regarded by many as the cultural heir of il Magnifico. He protected Botticelli, Michelangelo, Filippino Lippi, Bartolomeo Scala, and in 1494 he founded a workshop of ceramics at Cafaggiolo. He was overshadowed by Savonarola, but after the latter's death it was rumoured he would receive the effective personal rule of the Republic; however, he refused. In 1501, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco was suspected of a plot with Cesare Borgia to favour the latter in the conquest of the city, but the accusations were never confirmed. He died in Florence in 1503. His grandson Lorenzino de' Medici was the assassin of Alessandro de' Medici, the last ruler of Florence from the \\"senior\\" branch of the Medici, thereby passing power to Lorenzo's great-grandson Cosimo I de' Medici.

From 1947 to 1965, the state was known as the Romanian People's Republic (, RPR). The country was a Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc state with a dominant role for the Romanian Communist Party enshrined in its constitutions. Geographically, Romania bordered the Black Sea to the east; the Soviet Union (via the Ukrainian and Moldavian SSRs) to the north and east; Hungary and Yugoslavia to the west and Bulgaria to the south. As World War II ended, Romania, a former Axis member, was occupied by the Soviet Union, the sole representative of the Allies. On 6 March 1945, after mass demonstrations by communist sympathizers and political pressure from the Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission, a new pro-Soviet government that included members of the previously outlawed Romanian Workers' Party was installed. Gradually, more members of the Workers' Party and communist-aligned parties gained control of the administration and pre-war political leaders were steadily eliminated from political life. In December 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate and the People's Republic of Romania was declared. At first, Romania's scarce post-war resources were drained by the \\"SovRoms\\", new tax-exempt Soviet- Romanian companies that allowed the Soviet Union to control Romania's major sources of income.Zwass, A. From Failed Communism to Underdeveloped Capitalism: Transformation of Eastern Europe, the Post-Soviet Union, and China. M.E. Sharpe, 1995 Another drain was the war reparations paid to the Soviet Union. However, during the 1950s Romania's communist government began to assert more independence, leading to, for example, the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Romania by 1958. In the 1960s and 1970s, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu became General Secretary of the Communist Party (1965), Chairman of the State Council (1967) and assumed the newly established role of President in 1974. Ceau»ôescu's denunciation of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and a brief relaxation in internal repression led to a positive image both at home and in the West. However, rapid economic growth fueled in part by foreign credits gradually gave way to an austerity and political repression that led to the violent fall of his totalitarian government in December 1989. Many people were executed or died in custody during communist Romania's existence, most during the Stalinist era of the 1950s.

History  =Soviet occupation and rise of the Communists= The Socialist Republic of Romania in 1966 When King Michael, supported by the main political parties, overthrew Ion Antonescu in August 1944, breaking Romania away from the Axis and bringing it over to the Allied side, Michael could do nothing to erase the memory of his country's recent active participation in the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Romanian forces fought under Soviet command, driving through Northern Transylvania into Hungary proper, and on into Czechoslovakia and Austria. However, the Soviets treated Romania as a conquered territory,Romulus Rusan (dir.), in Du pass√© faisons table rase ! Histoire et m√©moire du communisme en Europe, Robert Laffont, Paris, 2002, p. 376‚Äì377 and Soviet troops continued to occupy the country on the basis of the Romanians having been active Nazi allies with a fascist government until very recently. The Yalta Conference had granted the Soviet Union a predominant interest in Romania, the Paris Peace Treaties did not acknowledge Romania as an allied co-belligerent, as the Romanian army had fought hard against the Soviets for the better part of the war, changing sides only when the tides started to turn. The Communists, as all political parties, played only a minor role in King Michael's first wartime government, headed by General Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu, though their presence increased in the one led by Nicolae RƒÉdescu. This changed in March 1945, when Dr. Petru Groza of the Ploughmen's Front, a party closely associated with the Communists, became prime minister. His government was broad-based on paper, including members of most major prewar parties except the fascist Iron Guard. However, the Communists held the key ministries, and most of the ministers nominally representing non-Communist parties were, like Groza himself, fellow travelers. The King was not happy with the direction of this government, but when he attempted to force Groza's resignation by refusing to sign any legislation (a move known as \\"the royal strike\\"), Groza simply chose to enact laws without bothering to obtain Michael's signature. On 8 November 1945, King Michael's name day, a pro-monarchy demonstration in front of the Royal Palace in Bucharest escalated into street fights between opposition supporters and soldiers, police and pro-government workers, resulting in dozens of killed and wounded; Soviet officers restrained Romanian soldiers and police from firing on civilians, and Soviet troops restored order. Despite the King's disapproval, the first Groza government brought land reform and women's suffrage, the former gave the party widespread popularity among peasants from the South and East while the latter gained it the support of educated women. However, it also brought the beginnings of Soviet domination of Romania. In the elections of 19 November 1946, the Communist-led Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD) claimed 84% of the votes. These elections were characterized by widespread irregularities, including intimidation, electoral fraud, and assassinationsRƒÉdulescu-Motru, in Cioroianu, p.65 Archives confirm suspicions at the time that the election results were, in fact, falsified.Frucht, R. Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture, Volume 1, p. 759. ABC-CLIO (2005). After forming a government, the Communists moved to eliminate the role of the centrist parties; notably, the National Peasants' Party was accused of espionage after it became clear in 1947 that their leaders were meeting secretly with United States officials. A show trial of their leadership was then arranged, and they were put in jail. Other parties were forced to \\"merge\\" with the Communists. In 1946 and 1947, several high-ranking members in the pro-Axis government were executed as war criminals, primarily for their involvement in the Holocaust and for attacking the Soviet Union. Antonescu himself was executed 1 June 1946. By 1947, Romania remained the only monarchy in the Eastern Bloc. On 30 December that year, Michael was at his palace in Sinaia when Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej summoned him back to Bucharest. They presented him with a pretyped instrument of abdication and demanded that he sign it. With pro- Communist troops surrounding his palace and his telephone lines cut, Michael was forced to sign the document. Hours later, Parliament abolished the monarchy and proclaimed Romania a People's Republic. In February 1948, the Communists merged with the Social Democrats to form the Romanian Workers' Party. However, most independent-minded Socialists were soon pushed out. Meanwhile, many non-Communist politicians had either been imprisoned or fled into exile. The Communist regime was formalized with the constitution of 13 April 1948. The new constitution was a near-copy of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. While it guaranteed all manner of freedoms on paper, any association which had a \\"fascist or anti-democratic nature\\" was forbidden. This provision was broadly interpreted to ban any party not willing to do the Communists' bidding, and gave a legal fa√ßade to a level of repression without precedent in the country's history. Although the 1948 Constitution and its two successors provided a simulacrum of religious freedom, the regime in fact had a policy of promoting Marxist-Leninist atheism, coupled with religious persecution. The role of religious bodies was strictly limited to their houses of worship, and large public demonstrations were strictly forbidden. In 1948, in order to minimize the role of the clergy in society, the government adopted a decree nationalizing church property, including schools.Marian Chiriac, ProvocƒÉrile diversitƒÉ»õii: politici publice privind minoritƒÉ»õile na»õionale »ôi religioase √Æn Rom√¢nia, p. 111. Bucharest: Centrul de Resurse pentru Diversitate EtnoculturalƒÉ, 2005, The regime found wiser to use religion and make it subservient to the regime rather than to eradicate it. The Communist government also disbanded the Romanian Greek-Catholic Uniate Church, declaring its merger with the Romanian Orthodox Church.Ageing, Ritual and Social Change: Comparing the Secular and Religious in Eastern and Western Europe; Ashgate AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Series; Daniela Koleva; Peter Coleman; Routledge Press, 2016; Pgs. 6‚Äì7; \\"The Romanian Orthodox Church by contrast has shown a much stronger development since the Second World War. After the initial waves of militant atheism were spent, a strong spiritual renewal movement took place in the late 1950s, and there has been a stream of notable spiritual figures both before and after communism. ... There was also a lack of consistent suppression of the Romanian Orthodox church by communist authorities. A large number of churches were left open, and monasteries continued to function.\\" =Romanian People's Republic= Early years 1949 stamp celebrating Romanian-Soviet friendship. The early years of Communist rule in Romania were marked by repeated changes of course and by numerous arrests and imprisonments as factions contended for dominance. The country's resources were also drained by the Soviet's SovRom agreements, which facilitated shipping of Romanian goods to the Soviet Union at nominal prices. On 11 June 1948, all banks and large businesses were nationalized. In the Communist leadership, there appear to have been three important factions, all of them Stalinist, differentiated more by their respective personal histories than by any deep political or philosophical differences. Later historiography claimed to identify the following factions: the \\"Muscovites\\", notably Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca, who had spent the war in Moscow, the \\"Prison Communists\\", notably Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who had been imprisoned during the war and the somewhat less firmly Stalinist, \\"Secretariat Communists\\", notably Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu that had made it through the Antonescu years by hiding within Romania and had participated in the broad governments immediately after King Michael's 1944 coup. Pauker and her allies were accused of deviating to the left and right. For instance, they were initially allied on not liquidating the rural bourgeoise, but later shifted their position. Ultimately, with Joseph Stalin's backing, Gheorghiu-Dej won out. Pauker was purged from the party (along with 192,000 other party members); PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu was executed after a show trial. Gheorghiu-Dej era Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej speaking at a workers' rally in Nation Square, Bucharest after the 1946 general election Gheorghiu-Dej, a committed Stalinist, was unhappy with the reforms in Nikita Khrushchev's Soviet Union after Stalin's death in 1953. He also balked at Comecon's goal of turning Romania into the \\"breadbasket\\" of the East Bloc, pursuing an economic plan based on heavy industry and energy production. The government closed Romania's largest labor camps, abandoned the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal project, halted rationing and hiked workers' wages. These factors combined to put Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej on a relatively independent and nationalist route. Gheorghiu-Dej identified with Stalinism, and the more liberal Soviet government threatened to undermine his authority. In an effort to reinforce his position, Gheorghiu-Dej pledged cooperation with any state, regardless of political-economic system, as long as it recognized international equality and did not interfere in other nations' domestic affairs. This policy led to a tightening of Romania's bonds with China, which also advocated national self-determination and opposed Soviet hegemonism. Gheorghiu-Dej resigned as the party's general secretary in 1954 but retained the premiership; a four-member collective secretariat, including Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, controlled the party for a year before Gheorghiu-Dej again took up the reins. Despite its new policy of international cooperation, Romania joined the Warsaw Treaty Organization (Warsaw Pact) in 1955, which entailed subordinating and integrating a portion of its military into the Soviet military machine. Romania later refused to allow Warsaw Pact maneuvers on its soil and limited its participation in military maneuvers elsewhere within the alliance. In 1956, the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalin in a secret speech before the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Gheorghiu-Dej and the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party (Partidul Muncitoresc Rom√¢n, PMR) were fully braced to weather de- Stalinization. Gheorghiu-Dej made Pauker, Luca and Georgescu scapegoats for the Romanian communist past excesses and claimed that the Romanian party had purged its Stalinist elements even before Stalin died in 1953. In all likelihood, Gheorghiu-Dej himself ordered the violence and coercion in the collectivization movements, since he did not rebuke those who perpetuated abuses. In fact, Pauker reprimanded any cadre who forced peasants, and once she was purged, the violence reappeared. In October 1956, Poland's communist leaders refused to succumb to Soviet military threats to intervene in domestic political affairs and install a more obedient politburo. A few weeks later, the Communist Party in Hungary virtually disintegrated during a popular revolution. Poland's defiance and Hungary's popular uprising inspired Romanian students to organize meetings in Bucure»ôti, Cluj and Timi»ôoara calling for liberty, better living conditions, and an end to Soviet domination. Under the pretext that the Hungarian uprising might incite his nation's own revolt, Gheorghiu-Dej took radical measures which meant persecutions and jailing of various \\"suspects\\", especially people of Hungarian origin. He also advocated swift Soviet intervention, and the Soviet Union reinforced its military presence in Romania, particularly along the Hungarian border. Although Romania's unrest proved fragmentary and controllable, Hungary's was not, so in November Moscow mounted a bloody invasion of Hungary. After the Revolution of 1956, Gheorghiu-Dej worked closely with Hungary's new leader, J√°nos K√°d√°r, who was installed by the Soviet Union. Romania took Hungary's former premier (leader of the 1956 revolution) Imre Nagy into custody. He was jailed at Snagov, north of Bucharest. After a series of interrogations by Soviets and Romanian authorities, Nagy was returned to Budapest for trial and execution. In Transylvania, the Romanian authorities merged Hungarian and Romanian universities at Cluj, putting an end to the Hungarian B√≥lyai University, and also worked on gradually eliminating Hungarian education in middle schools by transforming them into Romanian ones.https://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/despre/prezentare/istoric Gheorghiu-Dej spread fears about Hungary wanting to take over Transylvania. He took a two-pronged approach to the problem, arresting the leaders of the Hungarian People's Alliance, but, under Soviet pressure, establishing a nominally autonomous Hungarian region in the Sz√©kely Land.Deletant, Dennis, Ceau≈üescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965-1989, pp. 109-110. M.E. Sharpe, London, 1995, Romania's government also took measures to reduce public discontent by reducing investments in heavy industry, boosting output of consumer goods, decentralizing economic management, hiking wages and incentives, and instituting elements of worker management. The authorities eliminated compulsory deliveries for private farmers but reaccelerated the collectivization program in the mid-1950s, albeit less brutally than earlier. The government declared collectivization complete in 1962, when collective and state farms controlled 77% of the arable land. Despite Gheorghiu-Dej's claim that he had purged the Romanian party of Stalinists, he remained susceptible to attack for his obvious complicity in the party's activities from 1944 to 1953. At a plenary PMR meeting in March 1956, Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chi»ôinevschi, both Politburo members and deputy premiers, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej. Constantinescu, who advocated a Khrushchev-style liberalization, posed a particular threat to Gheorghiu-Dej because he enjoyed good connections with the Moscow leadership. The PMR purged Constantinescu and Chi»ôinevschi in 1957, denouncing both as Stalinists and charging them with complicity with Pauker. Afterwards, Gheorghiu-Dej faced no serious challenge to his leadership. Ceau»ôescu replaced Constantinescu as head of PMR cadres. The cadres ‚Äì anyone who was not a rank-and-file member of the Communist Party ‚Äì were deemed the Party's vanguard, as they were entrusted with the power to construct a new social order and the forms of power that would sustain it. They still underwent extensive surveillance, which created an environment of competition and rivalry. Persecution, the labour camp system and anti- communist resistance Armed resistance against the government Once the Communist government became more entrenched, the number of arrests increased. The General Directorate of People's Security, or 'Securitate', was in fact established in 1948 with the aim \\"to defend the democratic conquest and to ensure the security of the Romanian People‚Äôs Republic against the plotting of internal and external enemies\\". All strata of society were involved, but particularly targeted were the prewar elites, such as intellectuals, clerics, teachers, former politicians (even if they had left-leaning views) and anybody who could potentially form the nucleus of anti-Communist resistance. According to figures, in the years between 1945 and 1964, 73,334 people were arrested. The existing prisons were filled with political prisoners, and a new system of forced labor camps and prisons was created, modeled after the Soviet Gulag. A decision to put into practice the century-old project for a Danube-Black Sea Canal served as a pretext for the erection of several labor camps, where numerous people died. Some of the most notorious prisons included Sighet, Gherla, Pite»ôti and Aiud, and forced labor camps were set up at lead mines and in the Danube Delta. One of the most notorious and infamous brainwashing experiments in Eastern Europe's history took place in Romania, in the political prison of Pite≈üti, a small town, about 120 km northwest of Bucharest. This prison is infamous in Romania still for the so-called 'Pite≈üti experiment' or Pite≈üti phenomenon, conducted there between 1949 and 1952. The prison in Pite»ôti and the Pitesti experiment aimed to 'reeducate' the (real or imagined) opponents of the regime. It involved psychological and physical torture of prisoners, and the submission of them to humiliating, degrading and dehumanizing acts. Tens of people died in this 'experiment', but its aim was not to kill the people, but to 'reeducate' them. Some of those who were thus 'reeducated' later became torturers themselves. Of those who survived Pite≈üti, many either took their own lives or ended up in mental institutions.Elena Dragomir, Mircea StƒÉnescu, 'The Media vs. Historical Accuracy. How Romania's Current Communist Trials Are Being Misrepresented', http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2015/01/11/the-media-vs-historical- accuracy-how-romanias-current-communist-trials-are-being-misrepresented/. The Communist government also decided on the deportation of peasants from the Banat (south-west Transylvania, at the border with Yugoslavia), started on 18 June 1951. About 45,000 people were forcibly \\"resettled\\" in lesser populated regions on the eastern plains (BƒÉrƒÉgan). The government decision was directed towards creating a cordon sanitaire against Tito's Yugoslavia, but was also used as an intimidation tactic to force the remaining peasants to join collective farms. Most deportees lived in the BƒÉrƒÉgan for 5 years (until 1956), but some remained there permanently. Anti-communist resistance also had an organized form, and many people opposing the government took up arms and formed partisan groups, comprising 10‚Äì40 people. There were attacks on police posts and sabotage. Some of the famous partisans were Elisabeta Rizea from Nuc»ôoara and Gheorghe Arsenescu. Despite the numerous secret police (Securitate) and army troops massed against them, armed resistance in the mountains continued until the early 1960s, and one of the best known partisan leaders was not captured until 1974. Another form of anti-communist resistance, non-violent this time, was the student movement of 1956. In reaction to the anti-communist revolt in Hungary, echoes were felt all over the Eastern bloc. Protests took place in some university centers resulting in numerous arrests and expulsions. The most-organised student movement was in Timi»ôoara, where 3000 were arrested.\\"Trei mii de studen»õi timi»ôoreni, aresta»õi »ôi tortura»õi\\", Rom√¢nia liberƒÉ, 25 October 2007. In Bucharest and Cluj, organised groups were set up which tried to make common cause with the anti- communist movement in Hungary and coordinate activity. The authorities' reaction was immediate ‚Äì students were arrested or suspended from their courses, some teachers were dismissed, and new associations were set up to supervise student activities. Tens of thousands of people were killed as part of repression and agricultural collectivization in Communist Romania primarily under Gheorghiu-Dej.Valentino, Benjamin A (2005). Final solutions: mass killing and genocide in the twentieth century. Cornell University Press. pp. 91‚Äì151.Rummel, Rudolph, Statistics of Democide, 1997. =The Ceau»ôescu government= Nicolae Ceau»ôescu Gheorghiu-Dej died in 1965 and, after a power struggle, was succeeded by the previously obscure Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. During his last two years, Gheorghiu-Dej had exploited the Soviet‚ÄìChinese dispute and begun to oppose the hegemony of the Soviet Union. Ceau»ôescu, supported by colleagues of Gheorghiu-Dej such as Maurer, continued this popular line. Relations with Western countries and many other states began to be strengthened in what seemed to be the national interest of Romania. The forced Soviet (mostly Russian) cultural influence in the country which characterized the 1950s was stopped and Western media was allowed to circulate in Romania instead. First years On 21 August 1965, following the example of Czechoslovakia, the name of the country was changed to \\"Socialist Republic of Romania\\" (Republica SocialistƒÉ Rom√¢nia, RSR) and PMR's old name was restored (Partidul Comunist Rom√¢n, PCR; \\"Romanian Communist Party\\"). In his early years in power, Ceau»ôescu was genuinely popular, both at home and abroad. Agricultural goods were abundant, consumer goods began to reappear, there was a cultural thaw, and, what was important abroad, he spoke out against the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. While his reputation at home soon paled, he continued to have uncommonly good relations with Western governments and with international capitalist institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank because of his independent political line. Romania under Ceau»ôescu maintained and sometimes improved diplomatic and other relations with, among others, West Germany, Israel, China, Albania, and Pinochet's Chile, all for various reasons not on good terms with Moscow. Human rights issues Demographics graphs. A huge surge of the birth rate in 1967, as a result of Decree 770, is the most prominent feature of these graphs. Concerned about the country's low birthrates, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu enacted an aggressive natalist policy, which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. This period has later been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, Children of the Decree). To counter the sharp decline of the population, the Communist Party decided that the Romanian population should be increased from 23 to 30 million inhabitants. In October 1966, Decree 770 was authorized by Ceau»ôescu. These pro-natalist measures had some degree of success, as a baby boom resulted in the late 1960s, with the generations born in 1967 and 1968 being the largest in the country's history. The natalist policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a later decline due to an increased use of illegal abortion. Ceau»ôescu's policy resulted in the deaths of over 9,000 women due to illegal abortions,Kligman, Gail. \\"Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania\\". In Ginsburg, Faye D.; Rapp, Rayna, eds. Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1995 :234‚Äì255. Unique Identifier : AIDSLINE KIE/49442. large numbers of children put into Romanian orphanages by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets), and overcrowding in homes and schools. The irony of Ceau»ôescu's natalist policy was that a generation that may not otherwise have been born would eventually lead the Romanian Revolution which would overthrow and have him executed. Other restrictions of human rights included invasion of privacy by the secret police (the \\"Securitate\\"), censorship and relocation, but not on the same scale as in the 1950s. During the Ceau»ôescu era, there was a secret ongoing \\"trade\\" between Romania on one side and Israel and West Germany on the other side, under which Israel and West Germany paid money to Romania to allow Romanian citizens with certified Jewish or German ancestry to emigrate to Israel and West Germany, respectively. Industrialization 23 August demonstration Ceau»ôescu's Romania continued to pursue Gheorghiu- Dej's policy of industrialization. Romania made progress with the economy. From 1951 to 1974, Romania's gross industrial output increased at an average annual rate of 13 percent. Several branches of heavy industry were founded, including the machine-tool, tractor, and automotive industries; large-tonnage shipbuilding; the manufacture of electric diesel locomotives; and the electronics and petrochemical industries. Prior to the mid-1970s, Bucharest, as most other cities, was developed by expanding the city, especially towards the south, east and west. High density residential neighbourhoods were built on the outskirts of the city, some (such as Drumul Taberei, Berceni, Titan or Giurgiului) of architectural and urban planning value. Conservation plans were made, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s, but all were halted after Ceau»ôescu embarked on what is known as \\"The Small Cultural Revolution\\" (\\"Mica revolu»õie culturalƒÉ\\"), after visiting North Korea and the People's Republic of China and then delivering a speech known as the July Theses. In the late 1970s, the construction of the Bucharest Metro system was started. After two years, 10 km of network were already complete and after another 2 years, 9 km of tunnels were ready for use. By 17 August 1989, 49.01 km of the subway system and 34 stations were already in use. 1979 postage stamp The earthquake of 1977 shocked Bucharest; many buildings collapsed, and many others were weakened. This was the backdrop that led to a policy of large-scale demolition which affected monuments of historical significance or architectural masterpieces such as the monumental V«éc«ére»ôti Monastery (1722), the \\"Sf√¢nta Vineri\\" (1645) and \\"Enei\\" (1611) Churches, the Cotroceni (1679) and Pantelimon (1750) Monasteries, and the art deco \\"Republic's Stadium\\" (ANEF Stadium, 1926). Even the Palace of Justice ‚Äì built by Romania's foremost architect, Ion Mincu ‚Äì was scheduled for demolition in early 1990, according to the systematisation papers. Yet another tactic was abandoning and neglecting buildings and bringing them into such a state that they would require being torn down. Thus, the policy towards the city after the earthquake was not one of reconstruction, but one of demolition and building anew. An analysis by the Union of Architects, commissioned in 1990, claims that over 2000 buildings were torn down, with over 77 of very high architectural importance, most of them in good condition. Even Gara de Nord (the city's main railway station), listed on the Romanian Architectural Heritage List, was scheduled to be torn down and replaced in early 1992. Despite all of this, and despite the much- questioned treatment of HIV-infected orphans, the country continued to have a notably good system of schools. Also, not every industrialization project was a failure: Ceau»ôescu left Romania with a reasonably effective system of power generation and transmission, gave Bucharest a functioning subway, and left many cities with an increase in habitable apartment buildings. 1980s: severe rationing A queue for cooking oil in Bucharest, 1986 Romanian ration card, 1989 A propaganda poster on the streets of Bucharest, 1986. The caption reads \\"65 years since the creation of the Romanian Communist Party\\", while the background states \\"Ceau»ôescu Era\\" and \\"The Party. Ceau»ôescu. Romania.\\" Romania continued to make progress. High rates of growth in production created conditions for raising living standards of the people. From 1950 to the mid-1980s, average net wages increased more than eightfold. The consumption fund increased 22-fold, and a broad program of building cultural facilities and housing was carried out. Over 80 percent of the country's population had moved to new apartments during this period.International Affairs, No. 3, Vol.31, 1985, page(s): 141‚Äì152 Despite all this, living standards in the country remained some of Europe's lowest and as early as 1981, there were clear signs of public discontent, such as riots and an angry mob throwing rocks at Ceau»ôescu's helicopter while it made a flight to Transylvania that October. Ceau»ôescu desired to repay Western loans, and thus enacted a harsh austerity policy, including rationing of food, gas, heating and electricity. People in cities had to turn to natural gas containers (\\"butelii\\") or charcoal stoves, even though they were connected to the gas mains. With full-scale food rationing in place, the Communist Party published official guidelines on how Romanians could eat nutritiously while reducing their calorie intake by 25%. There was a shortage of available goods for the average Romanian. By 1984, despite a high crop yield and increased food production, wide-scale food rationing was introduced. The government promoted it as \\"rational eating\\" and \\"a means to reduce obesity\\". Most of what was available were export rejects, as most of the quality goods were exported, even underpriced, in order to obtain hard currency, either to pay the debt, or to push forward in the ever-growing pursuit of heavy industrialization. Measures in the mechanization and chemicalization of farming helped to increase the output of agricultural products. In 1950, more than 300 kg of cereals was gathered per head of the population; by 1982 this amount had increased to 1 ton per person. Meat production increased from 29.5 to 100 kg. In the late 1980s, the United Nations Human Development report classified Romania as having had high human development. The life expectancy was 71 years, the literacy rate was 96%, and the Real GDP per capita was $3000. By 1985, despite Romania's huge refining capacity, petroleum products were strictly rationed with supplies drastically cut, a Sunday curfew was instated, and many buses used methane propulsion (they were mockingly named \\"bombs\\"); taxis were converted to burning methanol. Electricity was rationed to divert supplies to heavy industry, with a maximum monthly allowed consumption of 20 kWh per family (everything over this limit was heavily taxed). Only one in five streetlights was kept on, and television was reduced to a single channel broadcasting just 2 hours each day. All these policies combined led Romanians to have the lowest standard of living in Europe, with the possible exception of Albania. Systematization: demolition and reconstruction Civic Center, Bucharest Systematization () refers to the program of urban planning carried out under Ceau»ôescu's regime. After a visit to North Korea in 1971, Ceau»ôescu was impressed by the Juche ideology of that country, and began a massive campaign shortly afterwards. Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a \\"multilaterally developed socialist society\\". The policy largely consisted in the mass construction of high-density blocks of flats (blocuri). During the 1980s, Ceau»ôescu became obsessed with building himself a palace of unprecedented proportions, along with an equally grandiose neighborhood, Centrul Civic, to accompany it. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic center of Bucharest were leveled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted Art Deco sports stadium, in order to make way for the grandiose Centrul Civic (Civic center) and the House of the Republic, now officially renamed the Palace of Parliament, were the most extreme manifestation of the systematization policy. Last years: increased social control personality cult of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife Elena. Members of »òoimii Patriei, a communist youth organization created in 1976 for children aged 4‚Äì7 Control over society became stricter and stricter, with an East German-style phone bugging system installed, and with Securitate recruiting more agents, extending censorship and keeping tabs and records on a large segment of the population. By 1989, according to CNSAS (the Council for Studies of the Archives of the Former Securitate), one in three Romanians was an informant for the Securitate. Due to this situation, income from tourism dropped substantially, the number of foreign tourists visiting Romania dropping by 75%, with the three main tour operators that organized trips in Romania leaving the country by 1987. Ceausescu also started becoming the subject of a vast personality cult, his portrait on every street and hanging in every public building. By 1988, with perestroika and glasnost policies in effect in the Soviet Union and China undergoing economic reforms, Romania's Stalinist sociopolitical system began to look increasingly out-of- place, but all attempts were made to keep the populace isolated from events going on outside the country. Also, while the West had been willing in the past to overlook Ceausescu's human rights record in lieu of his independent, anti-Soviet stance, this was becoming less relevant with the Cold War winding down. As such, Romania started coming under fire from the US and its allies, but such complaints were merely brushed off as \\"unwelcome interference in our nation's internal affairs\\". There was also a revival of the effort to build: *a Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal, which was completed, *a nationwide canal system and irrigation network, some of which was completed, but most of which is still a project, or was abandoned, *an effort to improve the railway system with electrification and a modern control system, *the CernavodƒÉ Nuclear Power Plant, *a national hydroelectric power system, including the Por»õile de Fier power station on the Danube in cooperation with Yugoslavia, *a network of oil refineries, *a fairly developed oceanic fishing fleet, *naval shipyards at Constan»õa, *a good industrial basis for the chemical and heavy machinery industries, and *a rather well-developed foreign policy Pollution Another legacy of this era was pollution: Ceau»ôescu's government scored badly on this count even by the standards of the Eastern European communist states. Examples include Cop»ôa MicƒÉ with its infamous Carbon Powder factory (in the 1980s, the whole city could be seen from satellite as covered by a thick black cloud), Hunedoara, or the plan, launched in 1989, to convert the unique Danube Delta ‚Äì a UNESCO World Heritage site ‚Äì to plain agricultural fields. =Downfall= Bra»ôov Riot December 1989 was the last act of a finale that had started in 1987, in Bra»ôov. The anti-communist riot in Bra»ôov on 15 November 1987 was the main political event that announced the imminent fall of communism in Romania.Emil Hurezeanu, as quoted (see note below) by: \\"Ziua care nu se uita. 15 noiembrie 1987, Brasov\\", Polirom, 2002, . This is documented by the book's revision, available at librarie.net The revolt started at the enterprise of Trucks Bra»ôov, as a strike that began on the night of 14 November, on the night-shift, and it continued the next morning with a march downtown, in front of the Council of the Romanian Communist Party. The population heard about this event through Radio Free Europe. As Emil Hurezeanu tells it: \\"I remember that Neculai Constantin Munteanu, the moderator of the show, started the broadcast: 'Bra»ôov! So Bra»ôov! Now it started!' This was the tone of the whole broadcast. We had interviews, information, interpretations of some political interpretations, older press articles announcing open street protests against Ceau»ôescu.\\" The reprisals against the strikers were rapid. The workers were arrested and imprisoned and their families were terrorized, but this act of courage on the part of the workers of Bra»ôov set the stage for future mass revolts. Emil Hurezeanu continues: \\"... All these have been turned into an offensive. The reaction of the regime was expected.. Very soon it was seen that the regime wants to hide it, to cancel it, practically not to respond to claims, not to take measures, to change anything, not to turn this protest into a public debate or even inside the party, in the Political Executive Committee. And then, the recipe of street confrontations with the regime became the only...possible. It became the leitmotif of all the media analysis. [...] It was the beginning of an action against the system that comprises more items. It was a labor protest in a citadel of Ceau»ôescu, it was an antidictatorial message, it was a clear political context: the pressures of Moscow, Ceau»ôescu's refusal to accept the demands of Gorbachev, the breaking with the West, who changed the views towards the regime ‚Äì all these have made us to believe that the beginning of the end was coming\\". Protests in 1989 before the Revolution In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR protested in a letter that criticized the economic policies of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, but shortly thereafter Ceau»ôescu achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11 billion several months earlier than even the Romanian dictator had expected. Ceau»ôescu was formally reelected secretary general of the Romanian Communist Party‚Äî-the only political party of the Romanian Socialist Republic‚Äî-on 14 November at the party's XIVth Congress. On 11 November 1989, before the party congress, on Bucharest's Brezoianu Street and Kogalniceanu Boulevard, students from Cluj- Napoca and Bucharest demonstrated with placards that read \\"We want Reforms against Ceau»ôescu government.\\" The students‚ÄîParaschivescu Mihnea, Vulpe Gratian, the economist Dan Caprariu from Cluj and others‚Äîwere arrested and investigated by the Securitate at the , accused of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14.00. There were other letters and other attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the communist police and Securitate. Revolution On 16 December, a protest broke out in Timi»ôoara in response to an attempt by the government to evict the dissident pastor L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s from his church flat. T≈ëk√©s had recently made critical comments against the regime to the Hungarian media,Brubaker, Rogers: Nationalist politics and everyday ethnicity in a Transylvanian town. Princeton University Press, 2006, page 119. and the government alleged that he was inciting ethnic hatred. His parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passers-by, including Romanian students, spontaneously joined the protest. Subsequently, police and Securitate forces showed up at the scene. By 7:30 pm, the protest had spread, and the original cause became largely irrelevant. Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the District Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). The Securitate responded with tear gas and water jets, while the police attacked rioters and arrested many of them. Around 9:00 pm, the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces. Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the District Committee building. The army failed to establish order and chaos ensued, with gunfire, fighting, burning of cars, and casualties. Unlike the Soviet Union at the same time, Romania had not developed a large, privileged elite. Ceausescu's family maintained all control of politics and Communist Party officials were paid poorly and often rotated from job to job, thus preventing any potential political rivals from developing a base of support. This prevented the rise of the Gorbachev-era reformist Communism found in Hungary or the Soviet Union. Ceausescu was so bitterly opposed to reform that he went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland after its Communists decided to treat with the opposition‚Äìa marked turn from his vehement opposition to the invasion of Czechoslovakia two decades earlier. Similarly, unlike in Poland, Ceau»ôescu reacted to strikes entirely through a strategy of further oppression. Romania was nearly the last of the Eastern European communist governments to fall; its fall was also the most violent up to that time. Protests and riots broke out in Timi»ôoara on 17 December and soldiers opened fire on the protesters, killing about 100 people. After cutting short a two-day trip to Iran, Ceau»ôescu gave a televised speech on 20 December in which he condemned the events of Timi»ôoara, saying he considered them an act of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Romania and an aggression through foreign secret services on Romania's sovereignty, and declared National Curfew, convoking a mass meeting in his support in Bucharest for the next day. The uprising of Timi»ôoara became known across the country, and on the morning of 21 December, protests spread to Sibiu, Bucharest and elsewhere. Matters came to a head on 21 December, when Ceausescu's speech at the Central Committee Building (CC) in Bucharest turned into chaos. The crowd, in a reaction that would have been unthinkable for most of the previous quarter-century, openly booed and jeered Ceau»ôescu as he spoke. He was forced to hide himself in the CC Building after losing control of his own \\"supporters\\". The night of 21 December brought fighting between protesters and the Securitate, police and part of the army forces; more than 1100 protesters lost their lives during the fights over the next few days. On the morning of 22 December, it was announced that the army general Vasile Milea was dead by suicide. Believing that Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over almost en masse to the budding rebellion. A second attempt at a speech the next day quickly failed. Soon, people were besieging the Central Committee Building, coming within a few meters of Ceau»ôescu himself; the Securitate did nothing to help him. Ceau»ôescu soon fled by helicopter from the rooftop of the CC Building, only to find himself abandoned in T√¢rgovi»ôte, where he and his wife Elena were finally tried by a drumhead court-martial, convicted after an hour and a half, and executed by firing squad moments after the verdict and sentence were announced on 25 December. The PCR dissolved soon afterward and has never been revived. Controversy over the events of December 1989 For several months after the events of December 1989, it was widely argued that Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front (FSN) had merely taken advantage of the chaos to stage a coup. While, ultimately, a great deal did change in Romania, it is still a subject of contention among Romanians and other observers as to whether this was their intent from the outset, or merely pragmatic playing of the cards they were dealt. By December 1989 Ceau»ôescu's harsh and counterproductive economic and political policies had cost him the support of many government officials and even the most loyal Communist Party cadres, most of whom joined forces with the popular revolution or simply refused to support him. This loss of support from government officials ultimately set the stage for Ceau»ôescu's demise. The Romanian army also was a factor in the regime's fall as it suffered from severe budget cuts while vast sums were spent on the Securitate, leaving them severely discontented and unwilling to save Ceau»ôescu. Politics RSR's political framework was a socialist republic run by a single party, the Romanian Communist Party. All of its legislative meetings took place in Bucharest. =Foreign relations= Romania's foreign policy was aligned with all nations that were aligned with the Soviet Union. Under Ceau»ôescu it enjoyed strategic relations with the Western Bloc and the Non-Aligned Movement, and it was the only Eastern Bloc country not to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Following the Sino-Soviet split, Romania also maintained relations with China and North Korea as well as the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge-ruled Democratic Kampuchea. However, Romania joined the United Nations on 14 December 1955 (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 109) as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972. In July 1980, Romania signed a comprehensive trade agreement with the European Economic Community; which in turn became the European Union in 1993 when Romania joined in 2007. Legacy Despite the harsh austerity measures of the 1980s in Romania being still in living memory, many Romanians respond in polls that they would prefer a restoration of the Communist regime (as much as 53% in a 2012 poll), looking back nostalgically at an era of perceived stability and safety as opposed to the recent economic and political instability. After the fall of the communist regime, Romania began shifting its political and economic policies from support (albeit tepid) for Moscow to aligning itself with Brussels and Washington by joining NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. The clientelistic networks that kept incompetent cadres in power were resilient after the Romanian Communist Party collapsed in 1989, allowing them to persist and generate post-communist corruption.Kligman, Gail and Katherine Verdery, Peasants Under Siege See also *Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of Romania *History of Romania since 1989 *List of Romanian communists *Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania *Reconstruction, a documentary about Communist Romania. *Romania in World War II *Sc√¢nteia, the Romanian Communist Party's newspaper. *Systematization (Romania) *Videogramme einer Revolution, a documentary by Harun Farocki and Andrei UjicƒÉ, made from 125 hours of amateur footage, during the December 1989 Revolution. *Captive Nations References External links *ceausescu.org, an extensive website on Communist Romania. *memorialsighet.ro, a memorial site dedicated to the victims of Communism in Romania, based at Sighet prison. *Euxeinos 3/2011: Romanian Communism between Commemoration, Nostalgia, and Scientific Debate Communism in Romania Former countries in Europe Former countries in the Balkans Romania History of Romania by period Eastern Bloc Natalism Communist states Atheist states States and territories established in 1947 1947 establishments in Romania States and territories disestablished in 1989 1989 disestablishments in Romania Totalitarian states Romania Former polities of the Cold War ","title":"Socialist Republic of Romania"},{"id":"297158","text":"After the Communist leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu was executed in the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, the National Salvation Front (FSN) took power, led by Ion Iliescu. The FSN transformed itself into a political party and overwhelmingly won the general election of May 1990, with Iliescu as president. These first months were marked by violent protests and counter- protests, involving among others the coal miners of the Jiu Valley. The government undertook a programme of free market economic reforms and privatization, following a gradualist line rather than shock therapy. Economic reforms have continued, although there was little economic growth until the 2000s. Social reforms soon after the revolution included easing of the former restrictions on contraception and abortion. Later governments implemented further social policy changes. Political reforms have been based on a new democratic constitution adopted in 1991. The FSN split that year, beginning a period of coalition governments that lasted until 2000, when Iliescu's Social Democratic Party (now the Party of Social Democracy in Romania, PDSR), returned to power and Iliescu again became President, with Adrian NƒÉstase as Prime Minister. This government fell in the 2004 elections amid allegations of corruption, and was succeeded by further unstable coalitions which have been subject to similar allegations. During the period Romania has become more closely integrated with the West, becoming a member of NATO in 2004 and of the European Union in 2007. Revolution 1989 marked the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. A mid-December protest in Timi»ôoara against the eviction of a Hungarian minister (L√°szl√≥ T≈ëk√©s) grew into a country-wide protest against the Ceau»ôescu r√©gime, sweeping the dictator from power. On 21 December, President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu had his apparatus gather a mass-meeting in Bucharest downtown in an attempt to rally popular support for his regime and publicly condemn the mass protests of Timi»ôoara. This meeting mirrored the mass-meeting gathered in 1968 when Ceau»ôescu had spoken out against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Treaty countries. This time, however, the people turned angry and riot broke out. During the events of the following week, marked by confusion and street fighting, it is estimated that 1,051 people lost their lives. To this day, the real number of casualties are unknown and so are the identities of the individuals responsible for them. Those responsible for the casualties are still called \\"the terrorists\\". Ceau»ôescu was arrested in T√¢rgovi»ôte. After a summary trial by a kangaroo court, he and his wife were executed on 25 December. During the Romanian Revolution, power was taken by a group called the National Salvation Front (FSN), which gathered dissidents, both from within the Communist Party and non-affiliated. The FSN quickly assumed the mission of restoring civil order and immediately took seemingly democratic measures. The Communist Party was thus outlawed, and Ceau»ôescu's most unpopular measures, such as bans on abortion and contraception, were rolled back. 1990‚Äì96 Romanian flag with a hole in the center, as used in 1989; photo made during an anti-government demonstration in Bucharest in September 2006 In the aftermath of the revolution, several parties which claimed to be successors of pre-World War II parties were formed. The most successful were the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Romanian Social Democrat Party (PSDR). Their leadership was made of former political prisoners of the 1950s, repatriated √©migr√©s and people which had not been affiliated with the Communist Party. As a reaction, the FSN declared it would participate in the elections as a political party. The announcement triggered a series of anti- government demonstrations in Bucharest. The already tense situation was aggravated by press campaigns. The newspapers, assuming either a strong pro- government or strong pro-opposition stance, issued attacks and tried to discredit the opposing side. The FSN, having a better organisational structure, and controlling the state administration, used the press still controlled by the state in its own advantage. FSN also organised counter- manifestations, gathering the support of the blue-collar workers in the numerous factories of Bucharest. As the anti-government protesters started to charge the Parliament, more groups of workers from around the country poured into Bucharest to protect the fragile government. The most notable among these groups where the coal miners of the Jiu Valley, known in Romania for their 1977 strike against the Ceau»ôescu regime. The workers attacked the offices of opposition parties, however the government intervened and succeeded in re- establishing the order. These event were to be known as the first Mineriad. On 28 February, less than a month later, another anti-government demonstration in Bucharest ended again with a confrontation between demonstrators and coal miners. This time, despite the demonstrators' pleas for non-violence, several people started throwing stones at the Government building. Riot police and army forces intervened to restore order, and on the same night, 4,000 miners rushed into Bucharest. This incident is known as the Mineriad of February 1990. Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on 20 May 1990. Iliescu won with almost 90% of the popular vote and thus became the first elected President of Romania. The FSN also secured more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Petre Roman, a professor at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, son of Communist official and veteran of the Spanish Civil War. The new government, which included some former low-key members of the Communist party, promised the implementation of some free market reforms. During the spring 1990 electoral campaign, the opposition parties organised a massive sit-in protest in down-town Bucharest, later known as the Golaniad. After the FSN won an overwhelming majority, most of the Bucharest protesters dispersed, however less than a hundred chose to remain in the square. The police efforts to evict them and re-establish traffic in central Bucharest two weeks after the elections was met with violence, and several state institutions were attacked (among them the Bucharest Police and the Interior Ministry). The freshly elected president, Ion Iliescu, issued a call to Romania's population to come and defend the government from further attacks. The main group to answer the call were the coal miners of Jiu Valley, leading to the June 1990 Mineriad. The miners and other groups physically confronted the demonstrators and forcibly cleared University Square. After the situation calmed down, president Iliescu publicly thanked the miners for their help in restoring order in Bucharest, and requested their return to the Jiu Valley. The general national and international media portrayal of the miners involvement in these events have been disputed by the miners, who claimed that most of the violence was perpetrated by government agents that were agitating the crowds; these claims, and a growing public suspicion of the sequence and orchestration of events, led to Parliamentary and other inquiries.Deletant, Dennis. \\"The Security Services since 1989: Turning over a new leaf.\\" (2004) Carey, Henry F.

Conflict Studies Research Centre, The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst: Camberley, Surrey GU15 4PQ. Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and later, in June 1994, a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician. Romania in 2008 In December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum. March 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the Democrat Party (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. With parliamentary support from the nationalist Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR), Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the ex-communist Socialist Workers' Party (PSM), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister Nicolae VƒÉcƒÉroiu, an economist and former bureaucrat during the Ceau»ôescu administration. The government took some limited steps towards the liberalisation of the market, started a privatisation program through management employee buyouts and sought to further relations with the Euro-Atlantic structures (the EEC/EU and NATO). The FDSN changed its name to Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) in July 1993 after the merger with several smaller parties. This coalition dissolved before the November 1996 elections. This coincided with the bankruptcy of the Caritas pyramid scheme, a major scandal at the time in Romania. 1996‚Äì2000 Emil Constantinescu of the Democrat Convention of Romania (CDR) won the second round of the 1996 presidential elections by a comfortable margin of 9% and thus replaced Iliescu as chief of state. (see: 1996 Romanian election) PDSR won the largest number of seats in Parliament, but was unable to form a viable coalition. Constituent parties of the CDR joined the Democratic Party (PD), the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR) to form a centrist coalition government, holding 60% of the seats in Parliament. This coalition of sorts frequently struggled for survival, as decisions were often delayed by long periods of negotiations among the involved parties. Nevertheless, this coalition was able to implement some reforms. The new coalition government, under prime minister Victor Ciorbea remained in office until March 1998, when Radu Vasile (PN»öCD) took over as prime minister. The period was marked by frequent quarrels inside the coalition, dubious bankruptcy of several major banks, and a general economic downturn. Deteriorating living conditions provoked a new mineriad in 1999. After several battles with the police on the road towards Bucharest, Radu Vasile succeeded in convincing miners' leader Miron Cozma to back down, and send the miners home. A political independent, Mugur IsƒÉrescu, the governor of the National Bank, eventually replaced Radu Vasile as head of the government, helping stabilise the Romanian economy significantly affected by the previous governments. 2000‚Äì04 Iliescu's Social Democratic Party, now renamed the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), returned to power in the 2000 elections, and Iliescu won a second constitutional term as the country's president. Adrian NƒÉstase became the Prime Minister of the newly formed government. The opposition frequently accused the government of corruption and attempts to control the press. The government was also accused of allowing local elected leaders of the PSD to gain significant influence over the administration of their region, which allegedly used the newly found power for personal interests. Nevertheless, the Romanian economy witnessed the first years of growth after the 1989 revolution. The government also started several projects for social housing, restarted the construction of the motorway connecting Bucharest to Romania's main port, Constan≈£a, and began the construction of a motorway across the western region of Transylvania. These projects however only had limited success. In the aftermath of the 2001 September 11 attacks, Romania backed the US on its \\"war on terrorism\\", giving overflight rights to the USAF during the US invasion of Afghanistan. The country's military also actively participated both in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2004, Romania was finally accepted as a full member of NATO. The NƒÉstase government also took steps towards European integration. The government successfully finalised negotiations with the European Union on most subjects, and 2007 was set as a tentative date for admission into the Union. 2004‚Äì07 Presidential and parliamentary elections took place again on 28 November 2004. No political party was able to secure a viable parliamentary majority. There was no winner in the first round of the presidential elections. Finally, the joint PNL-PD candidate, Traian BƒÉsescu, won the second round on 12 December 2004 with 51% of the vote and thus became the third post- revolutionary president of Romania. The PNL leader, CƒÉlin Popescu-TƒÉriceanu, was assigned the difficult task of building a coalition government excluding the PSD. In December 2004, the new coalition government (PD, PNL, PUR and UDMR) under prime minister TƒÉriceanu was sworn in. Soon disputes appeared between the parties of the coalition. Prime minister TƒÉriceanu, leader of the PNL, and president BƒÉsescu, constitutionally independent but generally regarded as de facto leader of the PD, accused each other of supporting illegitimate business interests. The PUR left the coalition after BƒÉsescu declared that the party's participation in the coalition was an \\"immoral solution\\", leaving the government with limited support in the Parliament. The frequent disputes between the prime-minister and the president also caused a faction of the PNL supportive of BƒÉsescu to split and form the Liberal Democratic Party (Romania). Romania joined the European Union, alongside Bulgaria, on 1 January 2007. After 2007 The disputes between the PNL prime minister and the president ultimately led to the expulsion of the PD ministers from the government. The PNL and UDMR formed a minority government, with intermittent support in Parliament from the PSD. As the conflict between the president and parliamentary parties continued, in May 2007, the PNL, PSD, PC (former PUR) and UDMR voted to impeach BƒÉsescu for alleged violations of the constitutions. Nicolae VƒÉcƒÉroiu, the president of the Senate became interim president, however BƒÉsescu was reinstated as a national referendum turned down the proposal to depose him. The relations between the president and the parliamentary parties other than PDL (formed after PD and PLD united) remained tense for the following 2 years. EU membership and the reduced government powers favoured foreign investment, and the Romanian economy continued on the upward trend set during the NƒÉstase government. In late 2008 the government lost the legislative elections, while PSD and PLD won roughly the same number of seats. An uneasy coalition was set up between the two parties, with the PDL president, Emil Boc, as prime-minister. Scandals soon erupted, with the PSD Interior minister changing several times amid allegations of corruption. The PDL youth minister was forced to resign after a Parliamentary commission accused her of siphoning government money towards the European Parliament campaign of Elena BƒÉsescu, the president's daughter. Accusation of funds mismanagement were also made against the PDL minister of tourism, Elena Udrea, a close ally of the president. In autumn 2008, during the electoral campaign for the November Presidential elections, the PSD accused coalition party PDL of planning to rig the elections in favour of Traian BƒÉsescu. As a result, Emil Boc expelled the PSD minister of interior from the government, and PSD left the coalition in protest. Soon after, the Parliament approved a motion of no confidence, dismissing the PDL government. The Parliament also voted down two PDL government proposed by Traian BƒÉsescu, and insisted on the creation of a PSD-PNL-UDMR government headed by FDGR-member Klaus Iohannis, a proposition turned down by BƒÉsescu. Traian BƒÉsescu succeeded to narrowly win the second round of the presidential election, against PSD candidate Mircea GeoanƒÉ. Emil Boc was reinstated as prime-minister in a PDL-UDMR government, with the help of splinter groups of PSD and PNL. In late 2009 and 2010 Romania was heavily hit by the worldwide economic crisis, causing several massive protests organised by trade unions. The opposition and the press frequently accused the government of preferential allocation of funds to its members, as well as generalised corruption.

Both the Israeli Government and Palestinian Authority called for its creation. It ‚Äúmonitor[ed] the situation in Hebron and record[ed] breaches of international humanitarian law, the agreements on Hebron between Israel and the Palestinian authority and human rights, in accordance with internationally recognized standards\\". It also monitored Israeli settlers, and aimed to help the Arab Palestinians who currently live there. It was staffed by personnel from Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. In 2019, the Israeli government declined to renew TIPH's mandate, effectively expelling the force.  Establishment  The TIPH mission was first established in 1994 after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre on 25 February 1994, in which 29 Palestinians were killed. On 18 March, the UN Security Council condemned the massacre in United Nations Security Council Resolution 904, and called for a temporary international presence in Hebron. On 31 March, representatives of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Israeli government signed an agreement requesting Italy, Denmark and Norway to provide observers to form a Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron (TIPH). The first TIPH mission operated from 8 May to 8 August 1994. However, the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government could not reach an agreement on the extension of the mandate, and the observers were therefore withdrawn on 8 August.TIPH, The Establishment of TIPH . Retrieved 19 December 2013 Peace negotiations between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Israeli Government resulted in the signing of the Oslo II Accord on 28 September 1995. It called for partial redeployment of the Israeli Defense Forces from the West Bank including Area H-1 in Hebron. It also called for the creation of another Temporary International Presence in Hebron.Oslo II Accord, Annex I: Protocol Concerning Redeployment and Security Arrangements, Article VII, Guidelines for Hebron. Retrieved from the Knesset website on 19 December 2013 On 12 May 1996, a temporary second TIPH mission observers started, this time with only Norwegian members. After the IDF's partial redeployment from Hebron, the parties signed the Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron on 17 January 1997, and four days later The Agreement on the Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron.TIPH, Agreement on the Temporary International Presence in the City of Hebron . Retrieved 19 December 2013 The third mission, started on 1 February 1997, included observers from Norway, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The agreement set a three-month mandate, renewable for a period of three months. Since then the mission has been reinforced with staff from those six countries with Norway as the coordinator. Purpose of the TIPH According to its mandate, the purpose of the TIPH was: # to promote by their presence a feeling of security to the Palestinians of Hebron; # to help promote stability and an appropriate environment conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of the Palestinians of Hebron and their economic development; # to observe the enhancement of peace and prosperity among Palestinians; # to assist in the promotion and execution of projects initiated by the donor countries; # to encourage economic development and growth in Hebron; # to provide reports as set out in paragraph 7 [of the Agreement on the Temporary international Presence in the City of Hebron]; and # to coordinate its activities with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities. Activities A vehicle belonging to the TIPH Members of the TIPH served as observers and were not permitted to interfere in disputes or incidents. Instead, they reported incidents to the Head of Mission of the TIPH. They had no military or police functions. The members of the TIPH voluntarily opted to be an unarmed mission. Reports of the TIPH on breaches of international humanitarian law, agreements on Hebron and human rights were not made public. They were available to the Israeli Defense Forces, the Palestinian Police Forces, and the member states. Specifically the reports looked for: *Damages to private property caused by IDF or settlers. *Prolonged ID checks or verbal and physical harassments by IDF personnel. *Other breaches of international human rights standards. *Breaches of rules applicable to Hebron, such as the Interim Agreement or Hebron Protocol. Incident reports were analysed twice weekly by the TIPH Report Assessment Group (RAG), which tried to identify patterns. In addition to observing and creating reports, the TIPH also worked on community relations projects to fulfill its mandate. The projects worked to ‚Äúpromote a feeling of security‚Äù and ‚Äúcontribute to economic development‚Äù in Hebron. TIPH as a peacekeeping force One of the differentiating factors between the TIPH and most other peacekeeping forces was that it operated as a bilateral agreement reached by two conflicting parties. Furthermore, it did not have a UN mandate, and instead it was an ‚Äúintergovernmental organization set up with the sole purpose to perform its mandate, which is based on a bilateral agreement signed by the Israelis and Palestinians.‚Äù The advantage of this arrangement was that without being linked to any external organizations, the TIPH served only to perform its mandate. It operated outside any perceived bias international organizations may have had. =Criticisms= Karin Aggestam, who served with TIPH in 2000, distinguishes between \\"neutrality\\" and \\"impartiality\\". According to Aggestam, TIPH is not expected to be neutral, since its mandate is to monitor the welfare of the Palestinian residents of Hebron in recognition of ‚Äúthe existing asymmetry between Israelis and Palestinians.\\" Israeli authorities and particularly Israeli settlers, who have never accepted TIPH's presence, have frequently accused TIPH of having a Palestinian bias. The Palestinian civilian population often feel frustrated at TIPH's practice of observing rather than actively intervening. According to Aggestam the settler population considers TIPH observers to have pre-conceived notions, possibly antisemitic, and often compare TIPH members to Nazi soldiers; as a result, Aggestam says that TIPH members are often subject to verbal and physical harassment, by settler youth in particular, with the IDF looking on passively. Aggestam judges that TIPH \\"strives towards an impartial and balanced practice to implement the goals stipulated in the mandate.\\" According to Aggestam, while the mandate of the TIPH, namely normalization of civil and economic life in Hebron, is a long-term aspiration, it was created as a temporary body with a mandate to be renewed every three months. In addition its members rotate every six to eighteen months. This leads to ‚Äúinadequate planning and a lack of institutional memory.‚Äù Incidents On 26 March 2002 two observers, Catherine Berruex and Turgut Cengiz Toytun√ß were killed, and another observer wounded after their car was shot on a road near Halhul.

He was born into a family that belonged to the Ezhava caste. He led a reform movement against the injustice in the caste-ridden society of Kerala in order to promote spiritual enlightenment and social equality. Biography Narayana Guru at the age of sixty Narayana Guru, n√© Nanu, was born on 28 August 1855 to a family of the Ezhava caste, Madan Asan and his wife Kuttiyamma, in the village of Chempazhanthy near Thiruvananthapuram, in the erstwhile state of Travancore, in British India. His early education was in the gurukula way under Chempazhanthi Mootha Pillai during which time his mother died when he was 15. At the age of 21, he went to central Travancore to learn from Raman Pillai Asan, a Sanskrit scholar who taught him Vedas, Upanishads and the literature and logical rhetoric of Sanskrit. He returned to his village in 1881 when his father was seriously ill, and started a village school where he taught local children which earned him the name Nanu Asan. A year later, he married Kaliamma but soon disassociated himself from the marriage to commence his public life as a social reformer. Leaving home, Guru traveled through Kerala and Tamil Nadu and it was during these journeys, he met Chattampi Swamikal, a social and religious reformer, who introduced Guru to Ayyavu Swamikal from whom he learned meditation and yoga. Later, he continued his wanderings until he reached the Pillathadam cave at Maruthwamala where he set up an hermitage and practiced meditation and yoga for the next eight years. In 1888, he visited Aruvippuram where he meditated for a while and during his stay there, he consecrated a piece of rock taken from the river, as the idol of Shiva, which has since become the Aruvippuram Shiva Temple. The act, which later came to be known as Aruvipuram Pratishta, created a social commotion among the upper caste Brahmins who questioned Guru's right to consecrate the idol. His reply to them that \\"This is not a Brahmin Shiva but an Ezhava Shiva\\" later became a famous quote, used against casteism. It was here, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP Yogam) was founded on 15 May 1903 by the efforts of Padmanabhan Palpu, better known as Dr. Palpu, with Narayana Guru as its founder president. Guru shifted his base to Sivagiri, near Varkala in 1904 where he opened a school for children from the lower strata of the society and provided free education to them without considering their caste. However, it took him seven years to build a temple there, the Sarada Mutt was built in 1912. He also built temples in other places such as Thrissur, Kannur, Anchuthengu, Thalassery, Kozhikode, and Mangalore and it took him to many places including Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) where he made his final visit in 1926. On his return to India, he was involved in a number of activities including the planning of the Sivagiri pilgrimage which was planned after his visit to Pallathuruthy in 1927 to attend the anniversary of the S.N.D.P. Yogam. Soon after the meeting at Pallathuruthy, which was the last public function he attended, Guru became ill and underwent treatment at places such as Aluva, Thrissur, Palakkad, and finally to Chennai; the physicians attended to him included Ayurvedic physicians like Cholayil Mami Vaidyar, Panappally Krishnan Vaidyar and Thycauttu Divakaran Moos as well as allopathic physicians viz. . Krishnan Thampi, Panikker, Palpu and a European physician by name, Noble. he returned to Sarada Mutt and it was here, he died on 20 September 1928, at the age of 73.  Legacy  = Fight against casteism = Casteism was practised in Kerala during the 19th and early 20th centuries and the lower caste people such as Ezhavas and the untouchable castes like Paraiyars, tribals and Pulayars had to suffer discrimination from the upper caste people such as Brahmins. It was against this discrimination that Guru performed his first major public act, the consecration of Siva idol at Aruvippuram in 1888. Overall, he consecrated forty five temples across Kerala and Tamil Nadu. His consecrations were not necessarily conventional deities; a slab inscribed with the words, Truth, Ethics, Compassion, Love, a vegetarian Shiva, a mirror and a sculpture by an Italian sculptor were among the various consecrations made by him. He propagated the ideals of compassion and religious tolerance and one of his noted works, Anukampadasakam, extols various religious figures such as Krishna, The Buddha, Adi Shankara, Jesus Christ. = Vaikom Satyagraha = The social protest of Vaikom Satyagraha was an agitation by the lower caste against untouchability in Hindu society of Travancore. It was reported that the trigger for the protest was an incident when Narayana Guru was stopped from passing through a road leading to Vaikom Temple by an upper caste person. It prompted Kumaran Asan and Muloor S.Padmanabha Panicker, both disciples of Guru, to compose poems in protest of the incident. T. K. Madhavan, another disciple, petitioned the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly in 1918 for rights to enter the temple and worship, regardless of the caste. A host of people including K. Kelappan and K. P. Kesava Menon, formed a committee and announced Kerala Paryatanam movement and with the support of Mahatma Gandhi, the agitation developed into a mass movement which resulted in the opening of the temple as well as three roads leading to it to people of all castes. The protest also influenced the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936. =Sivagiri pilgrimage= Sivagiri pilgrimage was conceived by three of the disciples of Guru viz. Vallabhasseri Govindan Vaidyar, T. K. Kittan Writer and Muloor S. Padmanabha Panicker which Guru approved in 1928, with his own recommendations. He suggested that the goals of the pilgrimage should be the promotion of education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training and advised Vaidyar and Writer to organise a series of lectures on these themes to stress the need for the practice of these ideals, stating this to be the core purpose of Sivagiri pilgrimage. However, his death soon after delayed the project until 1932 when the first pilgrimage was undertaken from Elavumthitta in Pathanamthitta District. = Writings and philosophy = Guru published 45 works in Malayalam, Sanskrit and Tamil languages which include Atmopadesa ≈öatakam, a hundred-verse spiritual poem and Daiva Dasakam, a universal prayer in ten verses. He also translated three major texts, Thirukural of Valluvar, Ishavasya Upanishad and Ozhivil Odukkam of Kannudaiya Vallalaar. It was he who propagated the motto, One Caste, One Religion, One God for All (Oru Jathi, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam, Manushyanu) which has become popular as a saying in Kerala. He furthered the non-dualistic philosophy of Adi Sankara by bringing it into practice by adding the concepts of social equality and universal brotherhood. = All Religions' Conference = Guru organized an All Region Conference in 1923 at Alwaye Advaita Ashram, which was reported to be first such event in India. It was an effort to counter the religious conversions Ezhava community was susceptible to and at the entrance of the conference, he arranged for a message to be displayed which read, We meet here not to argue and win, but to know and be known. The conference has since become an annual event, organised every year at the Ashram. = Notable disciples = * Bodhananda Swamikal * Nataraja Guru * Kumaran Asan * Sahodaran Ayyappan * T. K.

Rabindranath Tagore met Narayana Guru at the latter's ashram in Sivagiri in November 1922. Tagore later said of Narayana Guru that, \\"I have never come across one who is spiritually greater than Swami Narayana Guru or a person who is at par with him in spiritual attainment\\". Three years later, Mahatma Gandhi visited Guru during his 1925 trip to Kerala to participate in the Vaikom Satyagraha after which the Indian independence movement leader stated that \\"it was a great privilege in his life to have the darshan of an esteemed sage like Sree Narayana Guru.\\" On 21 August 1967, Narayana Guru was commemorated on an Indian postage stamp of denomination 15 nP. Another commemorative stamp on him was issued by Sri Lanka Post on 4 September 2009. The Reserve Bank of India issued two sets of commemorative coins depicting Guru's image, each valued at 5 and 100 respectively, on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary. The first of the several statues of Narayana Guru was erected at Jagannath Temple, Thalassery in 1927 while he was still alive. His statues are seen in many places in Kerala which include a 24 feet statue at Kaithamukku in Thiruvananthapuram. The Government of Kerala observe the birthday, the Sri Narayana Jayanthi, and the date of death (Sree Narayana Guru Samadhi) of Narayana Guru as public holidays.  In popular media  The life of Narayana Guru has been portrayed in a number of movies starting with the 1986 film Sree Narayana Guru, made by award-winning director P. A. Backer. Almost a decade and a half later, R. Sukumaran made a film on the life of Guru, titled Yugapurushan in 2010 with Thalaivasal Vijay playing the role of Guru and the film also featured Mammootty and Navya Nair. Brahmashri Narayana Guru Swamy is a Tulu film made in 2014 by Rajashekar Kotian on Guru's life and the film was the 5oth film made in the language. His life during the eight years he spent at Maruthwamala (also known as Marunnumamala) has been adapted into a docufiction, titled Marunnumamala and the film was released by Pinarayi Vijayan, the chief minister of Kerala on 9 August 2016.

In his later career he emerged as a commentator on Indian politics, and adhered to Hindu nationalism. Life =Early life= Sita Ram Goel was born to a Hindu family in Punjab, in 1921; though his childhood was spent in Calcutta. The family looked upon Sri Garibdas, a nirguna saint comparable to Kabir and Nanak, as its patron saint and his verses, \\"Granth Saheb\\",This is a separate collection of hymns by Garibdas and a few other Bhakti saints. Not to be confused with holy-book of The Sikhs were often recited at their home.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\" , Chapter 1 Goel graduated in history from the University of Delhi in 1944. As a student, he was a social activist and worked for a Harijan Ashram in his village. His sympathies for the Arya Samaj, the Harijans and the Indian freedom movement, along with his strong support for Mahatma Gandhi, brought him into conflict with many people in his village;Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 2 Goel also learned to speak and write Sanskrit during these college days.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 3 =Direct Action Day= On 16 August 1946, during the Direct Action Day riots in Calcutta that were instigated by the Muslim League shortly before Partition of India, Goel, his wife and their eldest son narrowly escaped with their lives. In his autobiography, How I became a Hindu, Goel writes that he \\"would have been killed by a Muslim mob\\" but his fluent Urdu and his Western dress saved him. He further relates, that the next evening they \\"had to vacate that house and scale a wall at the back to escape murderous Muslim mobs advancing with firearms.\\"Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 4 He subsequently wrote and circulated a lengthy article on the riots, titled \\"The Devil Dance in Calcutta\\", in which he held Hindus and Muslims equally responsible for the tragedy.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 5 His friend Ram Swarup, however, criticised him for equating Muslim violence with Hindu violence, claiming that Muslim violence was \\"aggressive and committed in the furtherance of a very reactionary and retrograde cause, namely the vivisection of India\\". =Communism to anti-communism= In mid-1940s Goel met members of the CSP (Congress Socialist Party), translated writings by Narendra Deva and Jayaprakash Narayan into English, and was offered a position as an editor of a CSP publication. But his first editorial for the weekly was deemed to be pro- communist, and he had to stop writing for the weekly. Sita Ram Goel had developed a strong Marxist leaning during his student days and was on the verge of joining the Communist Party of India in 1948. The Communist Party, however, was banned in Bengal on the day he planned to officially become its member. He read Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital, Harold Laski's \\"Communism\\", and \\"came to the conclusion that while Marx stood for a harmonised social system, Sri Aurobindo held the key to a harmonised human personality.\\" Later, books by Aldous Huxley, Victor Kravchenko, and Suzanne Labin (\\"Stalin's Russia\\") convinced him to abandon communism.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 6 Subsequently, he wrote many books critical of communism in Calcutta, and worked for the anti-communist \\"Society for the Defence of Freedom in Asia\\" (SDFA).Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\" , Chapter 7Elst, Koenraad, \\"Ram Swarup (1920‚Äì98): outline of a biography\\" According to Goel, when he wanted to apply for a passport in 1955, he was told that his case was receiving attention from the Prime Minister himself, and his application was not granted.Sita Ram Goel Genesis and Growth of Nehruism (1993) ='Nehruism' and censorship= Goel wrote regularly for the \\"Organiser\\" weekly, whose editor K. R. Malkani was his friend. In 1961‚Äì1962 he used the pseudonym Ekaki (solitary) while writing the series In Defence of Comrade Krishna Menon, critical of Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\" , Chapter 9 Although the series was widely read and praised, he was later admonished by a leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for being too focused on Nehru, and the series was discontinued.Suzanne Labin said:\\"I have read your masterpiece, 'In Defense of Comrade Krishna Menon.' It is profound, well-constructed, well argued, an honest, sound and brilliant study.\\" On the dust wrapper of \\"In Defense of Comrade Krishna Menon\\" The collected series was published in December 1963 by Vaidya Gurudatta and an updated version released as Genesis and Growth of Nehruism GENESIS AND GROWTH OF NEHRUISM thirty years later. However Goel's writings about Nehru in the Organiser cost him his jobGoel, Sita Ram, \\"How I became a Hindu\\", Chapter 8 and disillusioned him of the RSS. According to Goel, he was under surveillance by the Indian government during the 1962 Sino-Indian War. He was not arrested, even though this was according to him demanded by some government leaders, including future Prime Minister I. K. Gujral.Elst, Koenraad, \\"India's only communalist ‚Äì A short biography of Sita Ram Goel\\" In November 1962, he was recruited to participate in a guerrilla war against communist China, but he refused, saying \\"that so long as Pandit Nehru was the Prime Minister of the country, I could be only a traitor to it.\\" During the 1980s, Goel worked on a series titled Muslim Separatism: Causes and Consequences, but some passages from his articles were censored by the Organiser. He discovered that his series was considered too controversial by the RSS leadership who thought that it was alienating Muslims from the party, and Goel had to stop writing for the Organiser after the completion of the series Perversion of India's Political Parlance. K.R. Malkani, who was the editor for the Organiser for three decades, was sacked because of his support for Goel.Goel, Sita Ram, \\"Freedom of expression: Secular Theocracy Versus Liberal Democracy\\" Goel also noted that on other occasions that some of his articles, e.g. his article on the Vedapuri Iswaran Temple controversy, were suppressed in the Indian media.Goel:How I became a Hindu, History of Hindu- Christian EncountersKoenraad Elst. BJP vis-a-vis Hindu Resurgence. ch.17 =Publisher and writer= Goel founded the publishing house Biblia Impex India (Aditya Prakashan) in 1963, which published books by authors such as Dharampal, Ram Swarup, K. D. Sethna and K.R. Malkani. Sita Ram Goel joined the non-profit publishing house Voice of India in 1982.Goel:Freedom of Expression Voice of India was founded in 1982 by Ram Swarup, and published works by Harsh Narain, A.K. Chatterjee, K.S. Lal, Koenraad Elst, Rajendra Singh, Sant R.S. Nirala, and Shrikant Talageri among others . Early versions of several of Goel's books were previously published as a series in periodicals like Hinduism Today, Indian Express or the Organiser. Goel speculates that a series of articles he published in Indian Express in 1989 regarding the destruction of Hindu temples by Muslims may have contributed to the firing of its editor, Arun Shourie, the following year. In August 1990, while releasing two books published by Voice of India, Bharatiya Janta Party leader L. K. Advani chided Goel for using \\"strong language\\". Goel also worked as a part-time secretary for the All India Panchayat Parishad whose manager was his friend Jayaprakash Narayan. Narayan was impressed by Goel's Hindi book Samyak Sambuddha and said to Goel, \\"If Sanatana Dharma is what you say it is, I am all for it. You can count me as a Sanatanist from today. You can say to whomsoever you please that JP has become a Sanatanist.\\" Goel was fluent in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, English and Sanskrit, and read Persian.\\"Koenraad Elst Who is a Hindu? (2001) Opinions =On rewriting of history books= Goel claimed that there was a \\"systematic distortion\\" of India's history which the Marxist historians of Aligarh and the JNU had undertaken.Goel: How I became a Hindu, ch.9 In particular, he claims that the history of medieval India and the Islamic invasions is being rewritten. He described it as an \\"experiment with Untruth\\" and an exercise in suppressio veri suggestio falsi. According to him, the Ministry of Education has extended this experiment to school-level text-books of history. Goel called it \\"an insidious attempt at thought-control and brainwashing\\" and argued that the NCERT guidelines are \\"recommendations for telling lies to our children, or for not telling to them the truth at all.\\" =On Indian secularism= Goel has criticised Indian secularism, alleging that \\"this concept of Secularism is a gross perversion of the concept which arose in the modern West as a revolt against Christianity and which should mean, in the Indian context, a revolt against Islam as well.\\"Goel:How I became a Hindu. ch.9 =On media bias= Goel claimed that there is a media bias in India, in particular with regard to criticism of Islam or people like Nehru. In 1955 Goel asked one of his friends, who was supportive of Nehru and who had published in many international and national journals, to write an article critical of Nehru's policies. But the Indian publications didn't accept his critical article, and he claims that his standing as a scholar in India suffered thereby. Goel described an incident during a seminar on \\"Hurdles To Secularism\\" in 1963 which Goel attended, and which was presided over by Jayaprakash Narayan. As Goel tells it, most participants in the seminar criticised only \\"Hindu communalism.\\" But when one Muslim speaker took up the issue of Muslim communalism, he was shouted down by the other Muslims of the seminar, and had to stop talking.Goel:Defence of Hindu Society. ch.9 =On Indian nationalist organisations= Goel criticised Hindu nationalist organisations like the RSS. He claimed that with few exceptions they \\"shared the Nehruvian consensus on all important issues\\", and that \\"the RSS and the BJS stalwarts spent almost all their time and energy in proving that they were not Hindu communalists but honest secularists.\\" He also claimed that RSS members are worried almost only about the reputation of their organisation and their leaders, and are rather ignorant to Hindu causes. When a Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) leader asked him to write a book about the BJS, Goel replied that his book \\"would be pretty critical on the score of their policies.\\" Goel edited the book \\"Time for Stock-Taking\\", a collection of papers critical of the RSS.Hinduism, Environmentalism and the Nazi Bogey, Koenraad Elst Who is a Hindu? (2001) According to Belgian writer Koenraad Elst, Ram Swarup and Sita Ram Goel wrote in defence of Hinduism, never of \\"Hindutva\\". =On Christianity= Goel was outspoken in his criticism of Christianity.

Goel:History of Hindu-Christian Encounters, 1996 =On Islam and Muslims= Goel has criticised the history and doctrines of Islam in some of his writings. His works are also cited by critics of Islam like Robert SpencerThe Truth About Muhammad: Founder of the World's Most Intolerant Religion, Regnery Publishing 2006.

All I want to say is that no significant synthesis or assimilation took place in the past, and history should not be distorted and falsified to serve the political purposes of a Hindu-baiting herd.\\"Goel, Sita Ram, The Story of Islamic Imperialism He argues that the Muslims should evaluate the Islamic history and doctrines in terms of rationalism and humanism \\"without resort to the casuistry marshalled by the mullahs and sufis, or the apologetics propped up by the Aligarh and Stalinist schools of historians\\", just as the European Christians did centuries earlier with Christianity. He believed that the \\"average Muslim is as good or bad a human being as an average Hindu\\", and warned: :Some people are prone to confuse Islam with its victims, that is, the Muslims, and condemn the latter at the same time as they come to know the crudities of the former. This is a very serious confusion, which should be avoided by all those who believe in building up a broad-based human brotherhood as opposed to narrow, sectarian, self-centred, and chauvinistic nationalism or communalism. =On decline of Buddhism= Arun Shourie wrote about Goel: \\"Marxists cite only two other instances of Hindus having destroyed Buddhist temples. These too it turns out yield to completely contrary explanations. Again Marxists have been asked repeatedly to explain the construction they have been circulating -- to no avail. Equally important, Sita Ram Goel invited them to cite any Hindu text which orders Hindus to break the places of worship of other religions -- as the Bible does, as a pile of Islamic manuals does. He has asked them to name a single person who has been honoured by the Hindus because he broke such places -‚Äì the way Islamic historians and lore have glorified every Muslim ruler and invader who did so. A snooty silence has been the only response \\". Literary influences He wrote and published books in English and Hindi. He also translated George Orwell's 1984, three Dialogues of Plato, Denis Kincaid's The Great Rebel (about Shivaji) and other books into Hindi. Goel was well-read in Western and Eastern literature, and among his most favourite writers or works were Thomas Hardy, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Aldous Huxley, Plato, Tagore, Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, Vaishnava and Baul poets, the Kathamrita written by Mahendranath Gupta (Sri M.) and Thomas Gray's poem \\"Elegy\\".Goel: How I became a Hindu His favourite book was the Hindu epic Mahabharata, which he would read in its original language Sanskrit.Goel: How I became a Hindu, ch.1, 8 Sita Ram Goel was influenced by Indian writer and philosopher Ram Swarup.

Banned books =Understanding Islam through Hadis= In 1983, Goel reprinted Ram Swarup's Understanding Islam through Hadis. The book was a summary of the Sahih Muslim Hadith and consisted of extracts from the Hadiths. In 1987, he again reprinted the book, but the copies of a Hindi translation were seized by the police and Goel was arrested briefly.Freedom of expression ‚Äì Secular Theocracy Versus Liberal Democracy (1998, edited by Sita Ram Goel) In due course, some Muslims and the Jamaat-e- Islami weekly Radiance claimed that the book was offensive. In 1990, the Hindi translation of the book was banned. In March 1991, the English original was banned as well. The \\"criminal case\\" against Goel for printing the book was dismissed after some years on 5 May 1997, but the book still remains banned. Indian intellectuals protested against the arrest of Goel. Arun Shourie commented on the criminal case: :No one has ever refuted him on facts, but many have sought to smear him and his writing. They have thereby transmuted the work from mere scholarship into warning. (...)The forfeiture is exactly the sort of thing which had landed us where we are: where intellectual inquiry is shut out; where our traditions are not examined, and reassessed; and where as a consequence there is no dialogue. It is exactly the sort of thing too which foments reaction.

The judge discharged Goel and referred to the earlier court precedent \\"1983 CrLJ 1446\\". Speaking of the importance of that precedent, the judge in his discussion said: \\"If such a contention is accepted a day will come when that part of history which is unpalatable to a particular religion will have to be kept in cold storage on the pretext that the publication of such history would constitute an offence punishable under Sec. 153A of the Penal Code. The scope of S-153A cannot be enlarged to such an extent with a view to thwart history. (...) Otherwise, the position will be very precarious. A nation will have to forget its own history and in due course the nation will have no history at all. (...) If anybody intends to extinguish the history (by prohibiting its publication) of the nation on the pretext of taking action under the above sections, his act will have to be treated as malafide one.\\" =The Calcutta Quran Petition= Goel published The Calcutta Quran Petition with Chandmal Chopra in 1986.

A spit or sandspit is a deposition bar or beach landform off coasts or lake shores. It develops in places where re-entrance occurs, such as at a cove's headlands, by the process of longshore drift by longshore currents. The drift occurs due to waves meeting the beach at an oblique angle, moving sediment down the beach in a zigzag pattern. This is complemented by longshore currents, which further transport sediment through the water alongside the beach. These currents are caused by the same waves that cause the drift.Duane, D.B. and James, W.R., 1980, \\"Littoral transport in the surf zone elucidated by an Eulerian sediment tracer experiment:\\" Journal of Sedimentary Petrology. vol. 50, p. 929-942 Hydrology and geology Where the direction of the shore inland re-enters, or changes direction, for example at a headland, the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This is called deposition. This submerged bar of sediment allows longshore drift or littoral drift to continue to transport sediment in the direction the waves are breaking, forming an above-water spit. Without the complementary process of littoral drift, the bar would not build above the surface of the waves becoming a spit and would instead be leveled off underwater. Spits occur when longshore drift reaches a section of headland where the turn is greater than 30 degrees. The spit will continue out into the sea until water pressure (e.g. from a river) becomes too great to allow the sand to deposit. Vegetation may then start to grow on the spit, and the spit may become stable and often fertile. A spit may be considered a special form of a shoal. As spits grow, the water behind them is sheltered from wind and waves, and a salt marsh is likely to develop. Dungeness Spit in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, on the U.S. Pacific coast. Wave refraction can occur at the end of a spit, carrying sediment around the end to form a hook or recurved spit.Evans, O.F. 1942, \\"The origin of spits, bars and related structures:\\" Journal of Geology, v. 50, p. 846-863 Refraction in multiple directions may create a complex spit. Waves that arrive in a direction other than obliquely along the spit will halt the growth of the spit, shorten it, or eventually destroy it entirely. The sediments that make up spits come from a variety of sources including rivers and eroding bluffs, and changes there can have a major effect on spits and other coastal landforms. Activities such as logging and farming upstream can increase the sediment load of rivers, which may hurt the intertidal environments around spits by smothering delicate habitats. Roads or bulkheads built along bluffs can drastically reduce the volume of sediment eroded, so that not enough material is being pushed along to maintain the spit. If the supply of sediment is interrupted the sand at the neck (landward end) of the spit may be moved towards the head, eventually creating an island. If the supply is not interrupted, and the spit is not breached by the sea (or, if across an estuary, the river), the spit may become a bar, with both ends joined to land, and form a lagoon behind the bar. If an island lies offshore near where the coast changes direction, and the spit continues to grow until it connects the island to the mainland, it is called a tombolo. The end of a spit attached to land is called the proximal end, and the end jutting out into water is called the distal end. Notable spits around the world Farewell Spit, on New Zealand's South Island The longest spit in the world is the Arabat Spit in the Sea of Azov. It is approximately long. The longest spit in a freshwater body of water is Long Point, Ontario, which extends approximately into Lake Erie. Farewell Spit in New Zealand, at , in the north- west area of South Island, is believed to be caused by the strong prevailing winds and currents, bringing sand eroded from the Southern Alps of the South Island and depositing these into Golden Bay. A well-known spit in the UK is Spurn Point at the mouth of the Humber River; it is approximately long. The Curonian Spit, off the coast of Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea; it is . In a similar fashion, the Vistula Spit separates the Vistula Lagoon from the Gda≈Ñsk Bay off the coast of Poland. Zlatni Rat, a popular pebble beach jutting southward from the harbor town of Bol, on the Croatian island of Braƒç, is formed by Adriatic currents flowing east and west through the Hvar Channel, along the southern side of the island. The spit bends slightly west or east, changing its direction gradually, depending on the conditions of the tides and weather. Human settlement patterns Since prehistory humans have chosen certain spit formations as sites for human habitation. In some cases, these sites have been chosen for proximity to marine resource exploitation; the Chumash Native American prehistorical settlement on the Morro Bay is one such location.

Her book chronicles her domestic tribulations, her extensive pilgrimages to holy sites in Europe and the Holy Land, as well as her mystical conversations with God. She is honoured in the Anglican Communion, but was never made a Catholic saint. Early life and family She was born Margery Burnham or Brunham around 1373 in Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn), Norfolk, England. Her father, John Brunham, was a merchant in Lynn, mayor of the town and Member of Parliament. The first record of her Brunham family is a mention of her grandfather, Ralph de Brunham in 1320 in the Red Register of Lynn. By 1340 he had joined the Parliament of Lynn.Goodman, Anthony. Margery Kempe and Her World. Kempe's kinsman, possibly brother, Robert Brunham, became a Member of Parliament for Lynn in 1402 and 1417.Beal, Jane. \\"Margery Kempe.\\" British Writers: Supplement 12. Ed. Jay Parini. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2007. Scribner Writers Series. n.pag. Web. 23 October 2013. Life No records remain of any formal education that Kempe may have received. As an adult, a priest read to her \\"works of religious devotion\\" in English, which suggests that she might have been unable to read them herself, although she seems to have learned various texts by heart. As one would expect, Kempe appears to have been taught the Pater Noster (the Lord's Prayer), Ave Maria, the Ten Commandments, and other \\"virtues, vices, and articles of faith\\". At around twenty years of age, Kempe married John Kempe, who became a town official in 1394. Margery and John had at least fourteen children. A letter survives from Gda≈Ñsk which identifies the name of her eldest son as John and gives a reason for his visit to Lynn in 1431. Kempe was an orthodox Catholic and, like other medieval mystics, believed that she was summoned to a \\"greater intimacy with Christ,\\" in her case as a result of multiple visions and experiences she had as an adult. After the birth of her first child, Kempe went through a period of crisis for nearly eight months.Torn, Alison. \\"Medieval Mysticism Or Psychosis?.\\" Psychologist 24.10 (2011): 788‚Äì790. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. Web. 8 October 2013. which may perhaps have been an episode of postpartum psychosis. During her illness, Kempe claimed to have envisioned numerous devils and demons attacking her and commanding her to \\"forsake her faith, her family, and her friends\\" and that they even encouraged her to commit suicide. She also had a vision of Jesus Christ in the form of a man who asked her \\"Daughter, why have you forsaken me, and I never forsook you?\\". Kempe affirms that she had visitations and conversations with Jesus, Mary, God, and other religious figures and that she had visions of being an active participant during the birth and crucifixion of Christ. These visions and hallucinations physically affected her bodily senses, causing her to hear sounds and smell unknown, strange odours. She also reports hearing a heavenly melody that made her weep and want to live a chaste life. According to Beal, \\"Margery found other ways to express the intensity of her devotion to God. She prayed for a chaste marriage, went to confession two or three times a day, prayed early and often each day in church, wore a hair shirt, and willingly suffered whatever negative responses her community expressed in response to her extreme forms of devotion\\". Kempe was also known throughout her community for her constant weeping as she begged Christ for mercy and forgiveness. In Kempe's vision, Christ reassured her that he had forgiven her sins. \\"He gave her several commands: to call him her love, to stop wearing the hair shirt, to give up eating meat, to take the Eucharist every Sunday, to pray the rosary only until six o'clock, to be still and speak to him in thought‚Ä¶\\"; He also promised her that He would \\"give her victory over her enemies, give her the ability to answer all clerks, and that [He] will be with her and never forsake her, and to help her and never be parted from her\\". Kempe did not join a religious order, but carried out \\"her life of devotion, prayer, and tears in public\\". Indeed, her visions provoked her public displays of loud wailing, sobbing, and writhing which frightened and annoyed both clergy and laypeople. At one point in her life, she was imprisoned by the clergy and town officials and threatened with the possibility of rape; however, she does not record being sexually assaulted. Finally, during the 1420s she dictated her Book, known today as The Book of Margery Kempe which illustrates her visions, mystical and religious experiences, as well as her \\"temptations to lechery, her travels, and her trial for heresy\\".Drabble, Margaret. \\"Margery Kempe.\\" The Oxford Companion to English Literature. 6th ed. New York: Oxford UP, 2000. 552. Print. Kempe's book is commonly considered to be the first autobiography written in the English language. Kempe was tried for heresy multiple times in her life but never convicted; she mentions with pride her ability to deny the accusations of Lollardy with which she was faced. Possible reasons for her arrests include her preaching (which was forbidden to women), her wearing of all white as a married woman (i.e. impersonating a nun), or her apparent belief that she could pray for the souls of those in purgatory and tell whether or not someone was damned, in a manner similar to the concept of the intercession of saints. Kempe was also accused of preaching without Church approval as her public speeches skirted a thin line between making statements about her personal faith and professing to teach scripture. During an inquiry into her heresy she was thought to be possessed by a devil for quoting the scripture, and reminded of Paul's prohibition against women preachers. Kempe proved to be something of a nuisance in the communities where she resided, as her frantic wailing and extreme emotional responses seemed to imply a superior connection to God that some other lay people saw as diminishing their own, or inappropriately privileged above the relationship between God and the clergy. The Book Manuscript of The Book of Margery Kempe, chapter 18 (excerpt) Nearly everything that is known of Kempe's life comes from her Book. In the early 1430s, despite her illiteracy, Kempe decided to record her spiritual autobiography. In the preface to the book, she describes how she employed as a scribe an Englishman who had lived in Germany, but he died before the work was completed and what he had written was unintelligible to others. This may possibly have been John Kempe, her eldest son. She then persuaded a local priest, who may have been her confessor Robert Springold, to begin rewriting on 23 July 1436, and on 28 April 1438 he started work on an additional section covering the years 1431‚Äì4.Felicity Riddy, 'Kempe, Margery (b. c.1373, d. in or after 1438)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009). The narrative of Kempe's Book begins with the difficult birth of her first child. After describing the demonic torment and Christic apparition that followed, Kempe undertook two domestic businesses: a brewery and a grain mill (both common home-based businesses for medieval women). Both failed after a short period of time. Although she tried to be more devout, she was tempted by sexual pleasures and social jealousy for some years. Eventually turning away from her worldly work, Kempe dedicated herself completely to the spiritual calling that she felt her earlier vision required. Striving to live a life of commitment to God, Kempe in the summer of 1413 negotiated a chaste marriage with her husband. Although Chapter 15 of The Book of Margery Kempe describes her decision to lead a celibate life, Chapter 21 mentions that she is pregnant once again. It has been speculated that Kempe gives birth to a child, her last, during her pilgrimage; she later relates that she brought a child with her when she returned to England. It is unclear whether the child was conceived before the Kempes began their celibacy, or in a momentary lapse after it. Sometime around 1413, Kempe visited the female mystic and anchoress Julian of Norwich at her cell in Norwich. According to her own account, Kempe visited Julian and stayed for several days. She was especially eager to obtain Julian's approval for her visions of and conversations with God.Julian of Norwich. Revelation of Love. Trans. John Skinner. New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. 1996. The text reports that Julian approved of Kempe's revelations and gave Kempe reassurance that her religiosity was genuine.Hirsh, John C. The Revelations of Margery Kempe: Paramystical Practices in Late Medieval England.Leiden: E. J. Brill. 1989. However, Julian did instruct and caution Kempe to \\"measure these experiences according to the worship they accrue to God and the profit to her fellow Christians.\\"Lochrie, Karma. Margery Kempe and Translations of the Flesh. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 1991. Julian also confirmed that Kempe's tears are physical evidence of the Holy Spirit in soul. Kempe also received affirmation of her gifts of tears by way of approving comparison to a continental holy woman. In Chapter 62, Kempe describes an encounter with a friar who was relentless in his accusation for her incessant tears. This friar admits to having read of Marie of Oignies and now recognises that Kempe's tears are also a result of similar authentic devotion.Spearing, Elizabeth. Medieval Writings on Female Spirituality. New York: Penguin Books, 2002. pg. 244. In 1438, the year her book is known to have been completed, a \\"Margueria Kempe,\\" who may well have been Margery Kempe, was admitted to the Trinity Guild of Lynn. It is not known whether this is the same woman, however, and it is unknown when or where after this date Kempe died. Later influence The manuscript was copied, probably slightly before 1450, by someone who signed himself Salthows on the bottom portion of the final page, and contains annotations by four hands. This scribe has been shown to be the Norwich monk Richard Salthouse.Bale, Anthony. \\"Richard Salthouse of Norwich and the scribe of The Book of Margery Kempe\\". Chaucer Review, 52 (2017): 173-87. The first page of the manuscript contains the rubric, \\"Liber Montis Gracie. This boke is of Mountegrace,\\" and we can be sure that some of the annotations are the work of monks associated with the important Carthusian priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire. Although the four readers largely concerned themselves with correcting mistakes or emending the manuscript for clarity, there are also remarks about the Book's substance and some images which reflect Kempe's themes and images.Fredell, Joel. \\"Design and Authorship in the Book of Margery Kempe\\". Journal of the Early Book Society, 12 (2009): 1-34. A recipe, added to the final folio of the manuscript by a late- fourteenth-century or early-fifteenth-century reader of the Book, possibly at the cathedral priory in Norwich, provides more evidence of its readership and has been determined to be for medicinal sweets, or digestives, called 'dragges'.Laura Kalas Williams, \\"The Swetenesse of Confection: A Recipe for Spiritual Health in London\\", British Library, Additional MS 61823, The Book of Margery Kempe, Studies in the Age of Chaucer, Volume 40, 2018, pp. 155-190; and Laura Kalas, Margery Kempe's Spiritual Medicine: Suffering, Transformation and the Life-Course (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2020). Kempe's book was essentially lost for centuries, being known only from excerpts published by Wynkyn de Worde in around 1501, and by Henry Pepwell in 1521. However, in 1934 a manuscript (now British Library MS Additional 61823, the only surviving manuscript of Kempe's Book) was found in the private library of the Butler- Bowdon family, and then consulted by Hope Emily Allen. It has since been reprinted and translated in numerous editions. Kempe's significance Part of Kempe's significance lies in the autobiographical nature of her book; it is the best insight available of a female, middle class experience in the Middle Ages. Kempe is unusual when compared to contemporaneous holy women, such as Julian of Norwich, because she, unlike Julian, was not a nun. Although Kempe has sometimes been depicted as an \\"oddity\\" or a \\"madwoman,\\" recent scholarship on vernacular theologies and popular practices of piety suggest she was not as odd as she might appear. Her Book is revealed as a carefully constructed spiritual and social commentary. Some have suggested that it was written as fiction, in order to explore the aspects of the society in which she lived in a believable way. The suggestion that Kempe wrote her book as a work of fiction is said to be supported by the fact that she speaks of herself as \\"this creature\\" throughout the text, dissociating her from her work.Staley, Lynn. Margery Kempe's Dissenting Fictions. University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994. Print. However, this might equally be only a way of showing her humility, as a lowly creature of God. Her autobiography begins with \\"the onset of her spiritual quest, her recovery from the ghostly aftermath of her first child-bearing\\" (Swanson, 2003, p. 142). There is no firm evidence that Kempe could read or write, but Leyser notes that her religious culture was certainly informed by texts. She had such works read to her, including the Incendium Amoris by Richard Rolle; Walter Hilton has been cited as another possible influence on Kempe. Among other books that Kempe had read to her were, repeatedly, the Revelationes of Bridget of Sweden. Her own pilgrimages were related to those of that married saint, who had had eight children. Kempe and her Book are significant because they express the tension in late medieval England between institutional orthodoxy and increasingly public modes of religious dissent, especially those of the Lollards. Throughout her spiritual career, Kempe was challenged by both church and civil authorities on her adherence to the teachings of the institutional Church. The Bishop of Lincoln and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, were involved in trials of her allegedly teaching and preaching on scripture and faith in public, and wearing white clothes (interpreted as hypocrisy on the part of a married woman). In his efforts to suppress heresy, Arundel had enacted laws that forbade allowing women to preach, since the very fact of a woman preaching was seen as anti-canonical. In the 15th century, a pamphlet was published which represented Kempe as an anchoress, and which stripped from her \\"Book\\" any potential heterodoxical thought and dissenting behaviour. Because of this, some later scholars believed that she was a vowed religious holy woman like Julian of Norwich. They were surprised to encounter the psychologically and spiritually complex woman revealed in the original text of the \\"Book.\\" Mysticism During the fourteenth century, the task of interpreting the Bible and God through the written word was nominally restricted to men, specifically ordained priests. Because of this restriction, women mystics often expressed their experience of God differently - through the senses and the body - especially in the late Middle Ages.Roman, Christopher. Domestic Mysticism in Margery Kempe and Dame Julian on Norwich: The Transformation of Christian Spirituality in the Late Middle Ages. Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press. 2005. Mystics directly experienced God in three classical ways: first, bodily visions, meaning to be aware with one's senses - sight, sound, or others; second, ghostly visions, such as spiritual visions and sayings directly imparted to the soul; and lastly, intellectual enlightenment, where one's mind came into a new understanding of God.Julian of Norwich. Revelations of Love. Trans. John Skinner. New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. 1996. Pilgrimage Kempe was motivated to make a pilgrimage by hearing or reading the English translation of Bridget of Sweden's Revelations. This work promotes the purchase of indulgences at holy sites; these were pieces of paper representing the pardoning by the Church of purgatorial time otherwise owed after death due to sins. Kempe went on many pilgrimages and is known to have purchased indulgences for friends, enemies, the souls trapped in Purgatory and herself.Watt, Diane, \\"Faith in the Landscape: Overseas Pilgrimages in the Book of Margery Kempe\\".Webb, Diana. Medieval European Pilgrimage In 1413, soon after her father's death, Kempe left her husband to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\\"Kempe, Margery (c. 1373 ‚Äì c. 1440 ).\\" British Writers: Supplement 12.

During the winter, she spent thirteen weeks in Venice but she talks little about her observations of Venice in her book. At the time Venice was at \\"the height of its medieval splendor, rich in commerce and holy relics.\\" From Venice, Kempe travelled to Jerusalem via Ramlah. Kempe's voyage from Venice to Jerusalem is not a large part of her story overall. It is thought that she passed through Jaffa, which was the usual port for pilgrims who were heading to Jerusalem. One vivid detail that she recalls was her riding on a donkey when she saw Jerusalem for the first time, probably from Nabi Samwil, and that she nearly fell off the donkey because she was in such shock from the vision in front of her. During her pilgrimage Kempe visited places that she saw to be holy. She was in Jerusalem for three weeks and went to Bethlehem where Christ was born. She visited Mount Zion, which was where she believed Jesus had washed his disciples' feet. Kempe visited the burial places of Jesus, his mother Mary and the cross itself. Finally, she went to the River Jordan and Mount Quarentyne, which was where they believed Jesus had fasted for forty days, and Bethany, where Martha, Mary and Lazarus had lived. After she visited the Holy Land, Kempe returned to Italy and stayed in Assisi before going to Rome. Like many other medieval English pilgrims, Kempe resided at the Hospital of Saint Thomas of Canterbury in Rome. During her stay, she visited many churches including San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore, Santi Apostoli, San Marcello and St Birgitta's Chapel. She did not leave Rome until Easter 1415. When Kempe returned to Norwich, she passed through Middelburg (in today's Netherlands). In 1417, she set off again on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, travelling via Bristol, where she stayed at Henbury with Thomas Peverel, bishop of Worcester. On her return from Spain she visited the shrine of the holy blood at Hailes Abbey, in Gloucestershire, and then went on to Leicester. Kempe recounts several public interrogations during her travels. One followed her arrest by the Mayor of Leicester who accused her, in Latin, of being a \\"cheap whore, a lying Lollard,\\" and threatened her with prison. After Kempe was able to insist on the right of accusations to be made in English and to defend herself she was briefly cleared, but then brought to trial again by the Abbot, Dean and Mayor, and imprisoned for three weeks.Prudence Allen The Concept of Woman: The Early Humanist Reformation, 1250‚Äì1500 2006 Page 469 \\"In one of her first public interrogations, Margery defended herself against the Mayor of Leicester who had arrested her, saying, \\"You, you're a cheap whore, a lying Lollard, and you have an evil effect on others‚Äîso I'm going to have you put in.\\" After this, Kempe continued on to York. Here, she had many friends with whom she wept and attended mass. She also encountered further accusation, specifically of heresy, of which she was eventually found innocent by the Archbishop. She returned to Lynn some time in 1418. She visited important sites and religious figures in England, including Philip Repyngdon (the Bishop of Lincoln), Henry Chichele, and Thomas Arundel (both Archbishops of Canterbury). During the 1420s Kempe lived apart from her husband. When he fell ill, however, she returned to Lynn to be his nursemaid. Their son, who lived in Germany, also returned to Lynn with his wife. However, both her son and husband died in 1431.Phillips, Kim. \\"Margery Kempe and The Ages of Woman\\", in A Companion to The Book of Margery Kempe. Ed. John Arnold and Kathleen Lewis. Woodbridge: D.S. Brewer. 2004. 17‚Äì34. The last section of her book deals with a journey, beginning in April 1433, aiming to travel to Danzig with her daughter-in- law.Phillips, Kim. \\"Margery Kempe and the ages of Woman.\\" A Companion to The Book of Margery Kempe. Ed. John Arnold and Katherine Lewis. Woodbridge: D.S. Brewer. 2004. 17‚Äì34. From Danzig, Kempe visited the Holy Blood of Wilsnack relic. She then travelled to Aachen, and returned to Lynn via Calais, Canterbury and London (where she visited Syon Abbey). Veneration Kempe is honoured in the Church of England on 9 November and in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America together with Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton on 28 September.

He is known as the compiler or editor () of the medical treatise entitled Charaka Samhita (). Charaka has been identified as a native of Kashmir.Martin Levey, Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources, Brill Archive (1973), p. 10P. N. K.

Sopory, Glimpses Of Kashmir, APH Publishing Corporation (2004), p. 62Krishan Lal Kalla, The Literary Heritage of Kashmir, Mittal Publications (1985), p.65 The treatise that Charaka compiled is one of the foundational treatises of classical Indian medicine and is regarded one among the Brihat-Trayee (the Greatest - trio) of Ayurveda ().  Date  After surveying and evaluating all past scholarship on the subject of Charaka's date, Meulenbeld concluded that, > ... the author called Charaka cannot have lived later than about A.D. > 150-200 and not much earlier than about 100 B.C. Charaka and the Ayurveda  The term Charaka is a label said to apply to \\"wandering scholars\\" or \\"wandering physicians\\". According to Charaka's translations, health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort and attention to lifestyle. As per Indian heritage and Ayurvedic system, prevention of all types of diseases have a more prominent place than treatment, including restructuring of lifestyle to align with the course of nature and six seasons, which will guarantee complete wellness. Charaka seems to have been an early proponent of \\"prevention is better than cure\\" doctrine. The following statement is attributed to Acharya Charaka: Charaka contributions to the fields of physiology, etiology and embryology have been recognised. Charaka is generally considered as the first physician to present the concept of digestion, metabolism, and immunity. A body functions because it contains three dosha or principles, namely movement (vata), transformation (pitta) and lubrication & stability (kapha). The doshas correspond to the Western classification of humors, wind, bile, and phlegm. These doshas are produced when dhatus (blood, flesh and marrow) act upon the food eaten. For the same quantity of food eaten, one body, however, produces dosha in an amount different from another body. That is why one body is different from another. Further, he stressed, illness is caused when the balance among the three doshas in a human body are disturbed. To restore the balance he prescribed medicinal drugs. Although he was aware of germs in the body, he did not give them primary importance. Charaka studied the anatomy of the human body and various organs. He gave 360 as the total number of bones, including teeth, present in the human body. He was right when he considered heart to be a controlling centre. He claimed that the heart was connected to the entire body through 13 main channels. Apart from these channels, there were countless other ones of varying sizes which supplied not only nutrients to various tissues but also provided passage to waste products. He also claimed that any obstruction in the main channels led to a disease or deformity in the body. Agnivesa, under the guidance of the ancient physician Atreya, had written an encyclopedic treatise in the 8th century BCE. However, it was only when Charaka revised this treatise that it gained popularity and came to be known as Charaka Samhita. For two millennia it remained a standard work on the subject and was translated into many foreign languages, including Arabic and Latin. Contributions He is the compiler or editor (pratisa·πÉskartƒÅ) of the Charaka Samhita which is a work of several authors beginning, Charaka says, with Agnive≈õa. Charaka's work was later supplemented with an extra seventeen chapters added by the author D·πõ·∏çhabala. The Charaka Samhita is one of the two foundational text of Ayurveda, the other being the Sushruta Samhita. The Charaka Samhita contains eight parts and 120 chapters. Influences According to the introductory chapter of the Carakasa·πÉhitƒÅ itself, there existed six schools of medicine, founded by the disciples of the sage Punarvasu ƒÄtreya. Each of his disciples, Agnivesha, Bhela, Jat≈´karna, ParƒÅshara, HƒÅrƒ´ta, and KshƒÅrapƒÅni, composed a medical compendium. The Agnivesha SamhitƒÅ was later revised by Charaka and it came to be known as Charaka SamhitƒÅ. The Charaka SamhitƒÅ was itself later supplemented by Dridhbala. It contains the following eight parts: #Sutra Sthana #Nidan Sthana #Viman Sthana #Sharir Sthana #Indriya Sthana #Chikitsa Sthana #Kalpa Sthana #Siddhi Sthana There were 8 main chapters in this book. There had been 120 sub chapters of which they all in total had 12,000 verses and description of 2,000 medicines. There were cures for diseases related to almost every body part of human body and all medicines had natural elements to cure the diseases.

He also invented the card game cribbage. He is best known for his poem \\"Ballade upon a Wedding\\". Birth Suckling was born at Whitton, in the parish of Twickenham, Middlesex, and baptized there on 10 February 1609. His father, Sir John Suckling, was Secretary of State under James I and Comptroller of the Household of Charles I. His mother was Elizabeth Cranfield, sister of Sir Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. Life The poet inherited his father's estate at the age of 18, having attended Trinity College, Cambridge from 1623 and enrolled at Gray's Inn in 1627. His intimates included Ben Jonson, Thomas Carew, Richard Lovelace, Thomas Nabbes and especially John Hales and Sir William Davenant, who later furnished John Aubrey with information about him. In 1628, Suckling left London for France and Italy, returning before the autumn of 1630, when he was knighted. In 1631 he volunteered for a force raised by the Marquess of Hamilton to serve under Gustavus Adolphus in Germany. He was back at Whitehall in May 1632, after taking part in the Battle of Breitenfeld and several sieges. Suckling's poetic talent was one of many accomplishments, but commended him especially to Charles I and his queen, Henrietta Maria. He says of himself (\\"A Sessions of the Poets\\") that he \\"prized black eyes or a lucky hit at bowls above all the trophies of wit.\\" Aubrey says he invented the game of cribbage and relates that his sisters came weeping to a bowling green at Piccadilly to dissuade him from play, lest he lose their portions. Suckling was so passionately fond of cards that he frequently spent a whole morning in bed with a pack, studying the subtleties of his favourite games. He was not only the most skilful card-player, but also the best bowler in England.The Fortnightly, vol. 2, p. 300, George Henry Lewes, John Morley, Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, William Leonard Courtney, Frank Harris; Chapman & Hall, London 1865. Suckling is said to have sent numerous packs of marked playing cards to aristocratic houses in England and then travelled around playing cribbage with the gentry. He managed to win around ¬£20,000. In 1634, scandal was caused in his circle by a beating he received at the hands of Sir John Digby, a rival suitor for the daughter of Sir John Willoughby. It has been suggested that the incident, narrated at length in a letter of 10 November 1634 from George Garrard to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, had something to do with his beginning to seek more serious society. In 1635 he retired to his estates in obedience to an order of 20 June 1632 enforced by the Star Chamber against absentee landlordism, and employed his time in literary pursuits. In 1637 \\"A Sessions of the Poets\\" was circulated in manuscript, and about the same time he wrote a tract on Socinianism: An Account of Religion by Reason (printed 1646). In 1639, Suckling assisted King Charles I in his first Scottish war, raising a troop of a hundred horse at a cost of ¬£12,000, and accompanying Charles on the Scottish expedition of 1639. Putnam's Monthly Magazine of American Literature states, The amusing \\"pasquil\\" was \\"On Sir John Suckling's most warlike preparations for the Scottish war\\" in Musarum deliciae (printed 1656). Suckling was elected as member for Bramber in Sussex at a by-election on 30 April 1640, during the Short Parliament. It was complained he had won by \\"undue means\\", but the parliament was dissolved on 5 May in any case.Article by Tom Clayton. That winter Suckling addressed a letter to Henry Jermyn, afterwards Earl of St Albans, advising the king to disconcert the opposition leaders by making more concessions than they asked for. In May the following year he was implicated in the First Army Plot, an attempt to rescue the Earl of Strafford from the Tower and bring in French troops to the king's aid. This was exposed by the evidence of Colonel George Goring. Suckling left London with Jermyn and others on 6 May 1641 to flee to France, and were found guilty of high treason in their absence by Parliament on 13 August 1641. The circumstances of his short exile are obscure and accounts of how he died vary. Alexander Pope, writing in the next century, stated he had died on arriving in Calais, of fever from a wound in his foot caused by a nail having been driven into his boot by a servant who absconded with his money and papers.Pope's version appears in \\"Observations, anecdotes, and characters of books and men\\" by Joseph Spence (1699‚Äì1768), published in 1966 in an edition by Tom Clayton. He was certainly in Paris in the summer of 1641, when on 3 July Sir Francis Windebanke wrote to his son that Parliament had stopped pensions it had been paying to himself, Suckling and Jermyn. One pamphlet related a story of elopement with a lady to Spain, where he fell into the hands of the Inquisition. Generally accepted is Aubrey's statement that he committed suicide by poison in Paris, for fear of poverty. He was buried there at a Protestant cemetery. A pamphlet, An Elegy on the Renowned Sir John Sutling (sic) was written in February 1642 or earlier. Dramatic works As a dramatist Suckling is noteworthy for applying to regular drama the accessories being used in the production of masques. His Aglaura (printed 1638) was produced at his own expense with elaborate scenery. Even the lace on the actors' coats was of real gold and silver. The play, despite its felicity of diction, lacks dramatic interest. The criticism of Richard Flecknoe (Short Discourse of the English Stage) that it seemed \\"full of flowers, but rather stuck in than growing there,\\" has some weight. The Goblins (1638, printed 1646) has some reminiscences of The Tempest; Brennoralt,\\"A good tragedy, that I like well\\" (Pepys' Diary, 18 October 1667). or the Discontented Colonel (1639, printed 1646) is a satire on the Scots, disguised as Lithuanian rebels in the play. A fourth play, The Sad One, was left unfinished due to the outbreak of the Civil War. According to Samuel Pepys's diary (23 January 1666/67), he was persuaded to see \\"the dancing preparatory to to-morrow for 'The Goblins,' a play of Suckling's, not acted these twenty-five years; which was pretty.\\" Poetry Fragmenta Aurea, 1646 Among the best known of his minor pieces are the \\"Ballade upon a Wedding\\", for the marriage of Roger Boyle, afterwards Earl of Orrery, and Lady Margaret Howard, \\"I prithee, send me back my heart,\\" \\"Out upon it, I have loved three whole days together,\\" and \\"Why so pale and wan, fond lover?\\" from Aglaura. \\"A Sessions of the Poets\\", describes a meeting of contemporary versifiers under the presidency of Apollo to decide who should wear the laurel wreath. It is the prototype of many later satires. A collection of Suckling's poems first appeared in 1646 as Fragmenta Aurea. The Selections (1836) published by Alfred Inigo Suckling is in fact a complete edition, of which WC Hazlitt's edition (1874; revised 1892) is little more than a reprint with some additions. The Poems and Songs of Sir John Suckling, edited by John Gray and decorated with woodcut border and initials by Charles Ricketts, was artistically printed at the Ballantyne Press in 1896. In 1910 Suckling's works in prose and verse were edited by A. Hamilton Thompson. For anecdotes of Suckling's life see John Aubrey's Brief Lives (Clarendon Press ed., ii.242).

Clement chose him for the position over Ippolito, who was made a cardinal. Alessandro arrived in Florence to begin his rule on 5 July 1531, and nine months later was made hereditary Duke of Florence by Charles, as Tuscany lay outside the Papal States. This signaled the end of the Florentine Republic, and the start of over 200 years of Medici monarchy. ..

He left the university without taking a degree, and in about 1630 began a career in London as a dramatist. He was employed at some point in the household of a nobleman near Worcester, and seems to have been of a convivial disposition.\\"Nabbes, Thomas\\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 40. by Sidney Lee. s:Nabbes, Thomas (DNB00). Retrieved 15 Jul. 2013 He had at least two children, Bridget and William, both of whom died within two years of his death, and were buried with him at St Giles in the Fields. Burial For centuries there was uncertainty about Nabbes' fate and burial. In a 1628 poem he expressed hope that one day he would be worthy of entombment at Worcester Cathedral in his native Worcestershire, while an 18th- century theatre historian insisted he was interred at London's Temple Church. There were no records for him in either place.\\"Nabbes, Thomas\\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 40 by Sidney Lee s:Nabbes, Thomas (DNB00) In the mid-1900s it was finally discovered that Nabbes was buried on 6 April 1641, in his parish churchyard of St. Giles in the Fields. His two young children, Bridget and William, joined him there over the next two years. Works About 1630 Nabbes seems to have settled in London, resolved to try his fortunes as a dramatist. He was always a stranger to the best literary society, but found congenial companions in Chamberlain, Jordan, Marmion, and Tatham, and was known to many ‚Äògentlemen of the Inns of Court‚Äô (cf. Bride, Ded.) About January 1632‚Äì3 his first comedy, ‚ÄòCovent Garden,‚Äô was acted by the queen's servants, and was published in 1638 with a modest dedication addressed to Sir John Suckling. In the prologue he defends himself from stealing the title of the piece‚Äîin allusion doubtless to Richard Brome's ‚ÄòCovent Garden Weeded,‚Äô acted in 1632‚Äîand describes his ‚Äòmuse‚Äô as ‚Äòsolitary.‚Äô His second comedy, ‚ÄòTotenham Court,‚Äô was acted at the private house in Salisbury Court in 1633, and was also printed in 1638, with a dedication to William Mills. A third piece, ‚ÄòHannibal and Scipio, an hystorical Tragedy,‚Äô in five acts of blank verse, was produced in 1635 by the queen's servants at their private house in Drury Lane. Nabbes obviously modelled his play upon Marston's ‚ÄòSophonisba.‚Äô It was published in 1637, with a list of the actors' names. A third comedy, ‚ÄòThe Bride,‚Äô acted at the private house in Drury Lane, again by the queen's servants, in 1638, was published two years later, with a prefatory epistle addressed ‚Äòto the generalty of his noble friends, gentlemen of the severall honorable houses of the Inns of Court.‚Äô One of the characters, Mrs. Ferret, the imperious wife, has been compared to Ben Jonson's Mistress Otter. Gerard Langbaine, in his An Account of the English Dramatic Poets (1691), places Nabbes among the poets of the third rate. The author of Theophilus Cibber's Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift (1753) declares that in strict justice ‚Äòhe cannot rise above a fifth.‚Äô This severe verdict is ill justified. He is a passable writer of comedies, inventing his own plots, and lightly censuring the foibles of middle-class London society. Samuel Sheppard in the sixth sestiad (‚Äòthe Assizes of Apollo‚Äô) of his ‚ÄòTimes Display'd,‚Äô 1646, associates Nabbes's name with the names of John Davenant, James Shirley, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher, and selects his tragedy of Hannibal and Scipio for special commendation. Nabbes displays a satisfactory command of the niceties of dramatic blank verse, in which all his plays, excluding the two earliest comedies, were mainly written. Although he was far more refined in sentiment than most of his contemporaries, he is capable at times of considerable coarseness. As a writer of masques Nabbes deserves more consideration. His touch was usually light and his machinery ingenious. The least satisfactory was the one first published, viz. ‚ÄòMicrocosmus. A Morall Maske, presented with generall liking, at the Private House in Salisbury Court, and heere set down according to the intention of the Authour, Thomas Nabbes,‚Äô 1637. A reference to the approaching publication of the work was made in ‚ÄòDon Zara del Fogo,‚Äô a mock romance, which was written before 1637, though not published till 1656. Richard Brome contributed prefatory verses. His ‚ÄòSpring's Glory‚Äô (1638) bears some resemblance to Thomas Middleton's ‚ÄòInner Temple Masque,‚Äô published in 1618. The ‚ÄòPresentation intended for the Prince his Highnesse on his Birthday‚Äô (1638) is bright and attractive, although it does not appear to have been actually performed. It was printed with ‚ÄòThe Spring's Glory,‚Äô together with some occasional verses. The volume, which was dedicated to William, son of Peter Balle, was entitled ‚ÄòThe Spring's Glory, a Maske. Together with sundry Poems, Epigrams, Elegies, and Epithalamiums. By Thomas Nabbes,‚Äô 1639. Of the poems, the verses on a ‚ÄòMistresse of whose Affection hee was doubtfull‚Äô have charm; they were included in William James Linton's Collection of Rare Poems. Nabbes contributed commendatory verses to Shackerley Marmion's ‚ÄòLegend of Cupid and Psyche,‚Äô 1637; Robert Chamberlain's ‚ÄòNocturnal Lucubrations,‚Äô 1638; Thomas Jordan's ‚ÄòPoeticall Varieties,‚Äô 1640; John Tatham's ‚ÄòFancies Theater,‚Äô 1640; Humphrey Mills's ‚ÄòA Night's Search.‚Äô 1640; Thomas Beedome's ‚ÄòPoems Divine and Humane,‚Äô 1641; and the ‚ÄòPh≈ìnix of these Late Times; or, the Life of Mr. Henry Welby, Esq.‚Äô (1637). Welby was an eccentric, who was credited with living without food or drink for the last forty-four years of his life. To the fifth edition of Richard Knolles's ‚ÄòGenerall Historie of the Turkes‚Äô (1638) Nabbes appended ‚ÄòA Continuation of the Turkish Historie, from the Yeare of our Lord 1628 to the end of the Yeare 1637. Collected out of the Dispatches of Sr. Peter Wyche, Knight, Embassador at Constantinople, and others.‚Äô The dedication is addressed to Sir Thomas Roe, whom Nabbes describes as a stranger to him. Nabbes' verse is smooth and musical. His language is sometimes coarse, but his general attitude is moral. The Masque of Microcosmus is really a morality play, in which Physander after much error is reunited to his wife Bellanima, who personifies the soul. The other two masques, slighter in construction but ingenious, show Nabbes at his best. Nabbes's plays were collected in 1639; and Microcosmus was printed in Robert Dodsley's Old Plays (1744). All his works, with the exception of his continuation of Knolles's history, were reprinted by A.H. Bullen in Old English Plays (second series, 1887).\\"Nabbes, Thomas.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Library Edition.Subscription required.

It is said to have been written as a rival to Shirley's ‚ÄòPolitician,‚Äô but was never acted, owing to the refusal of the actors to undertake the performance. Three friends (Edward Benlowes, C. G., and R. W.) prefixed commendatory verses by way of consoling the author for the slight thus cast upon him. The play is a bleak tragedy, beginning in the aftermath of the death of the prince and ending in the deaths of most of the characters. Its plot includes hidden identities, poison, deceit, Machiavellian social climbing, murder and a duel. In the preface Nabbes specifies his intent to move away from the bombast and melodrama of popular drama, towards a subtler, more intellectual kind of theatre. Unfortunately, the theatre companies did not share his ambition and he could find nobody to take charge of producing it. The play received its historical world premiere on Friday 18 October (2013) at St Giles in the Fields Church, the burial site of the author, directed by Brice Stratford as part of the Owle Schreame theatre company's Cannibal Valour Rep Season of obscure classical productions.

He is best known for his ribald, earthy poem, Libro de buen amor (The Book of Good Love). Biography = Origins = He was born in Alcal√° de Henares. Little is known about him today, save that he was a cleric and probably studied in Toledo. Though his birth name is known to be Juan Ruiz, he is widely referred to by his title of \\"archpriest of Hita.\\"√Ålvarez JC. El Arcipreste de Hita. Puerta de Madrid. 01/08/2020; 2.617:9. =Imprisonment= According to his own book, he was imprisoned for years, thought to be between 1337 and 1350, as punishment for some of his deeds (if the poem is any guide, they were quite inconsistent with his position as priest). However, the poem has long been considered as pseudo- autobiography and the verses that mention his imprisonment appear at the end of the book and are generally thought to have been added after the fact. One of his poems states that he was imprisoned on the order of Gil Albornoz, the Archbishop of Toledo. It is not known whether he was sentenced for his irregularities of conduct, or on account of his satirical reflections on his ecclesiastical superiors. Nor is it possible to fix the precise date of his imprisonment. Albornoz nominally occupied the see of Toledo from 1337 to 1368, but he fell into disgrace in 1351 and fled to Avignon. A consideration of these circumstances points to the probable conclusion that Ruiz was in prison from 1337 to 1350, but this is conjecture. What seems established is that he finished the Libro de buen amor in 1343. Indeed, almost nothing is known about the author(s) of the poem or if he was even named Juan Ruiz. One scholarly study found hundreds of clerics in mid-fourteenth-century Castile named Juan Ruiz.Henry Ansgar Kelly, ‚ÄúA Juan Ruiz Directory for 1380-1382,‚Äù Mester 16:2 (Fall 1988) 69-93; Henry Ansgar Kelly, ‚ÄúJuan Ruiz and Archpriests: Novel Reports,‚Äù La Coronica 16:2 (Spring 1988) 32-54. The name appears to be the equivalent of John Smith and may have been chosen to represent the everyman. =Death= It has been estimated that he died around 1350 (presumably in prison); by 1351, he no longer held the title of archpriest of Hita. The Book of Good Love Libro de Buen Amor (Book of Good Love) is a massive and episodic work that combines poems to Jesus and Mary; Ruiz's unrequited love, and fables. The poem itself is 1,728 stanzas long. The breadth of the writer's scope, and the exuberance of his style have caused some to term him \\"the Castilian Chaucer.\\" Speculation regarding whether or not the book was actually an autobiography is incessant. His language is characterized by its richness and its sermon-like tendency to repeat the same concept in several different ways. Noted for being very creative and alive, his work utilizes colloquial, popular vocabulary. His natural gifts were supplemented by his varied culture; he clearly had a considerable knowledge of the colloquial (and perhaps also of literary) Arabic widely spoken in the Spain of his time; his classical reading was apparently not extensive, but he knew by heart the Disticha of Dionysius Cato, and admits his indebtedness to Ovid and to the De Amore ascribed to Pamphilus; his references to Blanchefleur, to Tristan and to Yseult, indicate an acquaintance with French literature, and he utilizes the fabliaux with remarkable deftness; lastly, he adapts fables and apologues from Aesop, from Pedro Alfonso's Disciplina clericalis, and from medieval bestiaries. All these heterogeneous materials are fused in the substance of his versified autobiography, into which he intercalates devout songs, parodies of epic or forensic formulae, and lyrical digressions on every aspect of life. He shows a profound knowledge of human emotion and is able to strike a balance between gentleness and brazenness in his shrewd and frequently ironic writing. Ruiz, in fact, offers a complete picture of picaresque society in the most complex and rich cultural geography of Europe during the first half of the 14th century, and his impartial irony lends a deeper tone to his rich coloring. He knows the weaknesses of both clergy and laity, and he dwells with equal complacency on the amorous adventures of great ladies, on the perverse intrigues arranged by demure nuns behind their convent walls, and on the simpler instinctive animalism of country lasses and Moorish dancing-girls. In addition to the faculty of genial observation Ruiz has the gift of creating characters and presenting types of human nature: from his Don Fur√≥n is derived the hungry gentleman in Lazarillo de Tormes, in Don Mel√≥n and Do√±a Endrina he anticipates Calisto and Melibea in the Celestina, and Celestina herself is developed from the Trotaconventos of Ruiz. Moreover, Ruiz was justly proud of his metrical innovations: the Libro de buen amor is mainly written in the cuaderna via modelled on the French alexandrine, but he imparts to the measure a variety and rapidity previously unknown in Castilian, and he experiments by introducing internal rhymes or by shortening the fourth line into an octosyllabic verse; or he boldly recasts the form of the stanza, extending it to six or seven lines with alternate verses of eight and five syllables. But his technical skill never sinks to triviality. All his writing bears the stamp of a unique personality, and, if he never attempts a sublime flight, he conveys with contagious force his enthusiasm for life under any conditions -- in town, country, vagabondage or gaol. Johan Ruys (original spelling), arcipreste de la Hita, was imprisoned by the Inquisition for a few years due to his one-sided love affair with a lady of the nobility. In our modern society, he would have been charged with \\"harassment\\". He is said to have died 7 or 8 years after his release from the Inquisition's holding facility. There are today three manuscripts of the Libro de Buen Amor. The Salamanca version, denoted S, resides in Madrid's Biblioteca Real and is considered the best of the three codices. The other two are the Academia Espa√±ola version, known as Gayoso (G), and the Toledo (T) manuscript. Legacy Ruiz's influence is visible in El Corbacho, the work of another jovial goliard, Alphonso Martinez de Toledo, arch-priest of Talavera, who wrote more than half a century before the Libro de buen amor was imitated by the author of the Celestina. Ruiz is mentioned with respect by Santillana, and that his reputation extended beyond Spain is proved by the surviving fragments of a Portuguese version of the Libro de buen amor. By some strange accident he was neglected, and apparently forgotten, till 1790, when an expurgated edition of his poems was published by Tom√°s Antonio Sanchez; from that date his fame has steadily increased, and by the unanimous verdict of all competent judges he is now ranked as the greatest Castilian poet of his century. Paul Heyse (18301914) published a translation into German of a poem by Ruiz in the 1852 collection Spanisches Liederbuch (Spanish Songbook), with the first line \\"Nun bin ich dein, du aller Blumen Blume\\". The translation was set to music for voice and piano by Hugo Wolf (18601903), and published in his 1891 Lieder collection also called Spanisches Liederbuch.

In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05&region;=eak (October 2000) ‚Äì 660 AD) was a kingdom located in southwestern Korea. It was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, together with Goguryeo and Silla. Baekje was founded by Onjo, the third son of Goguryeo's founder Jumong and So Seo-no, at Wiryeseong (present-day southern Seoul). Baekje, like Goguryeo, claimed to succeed Buyeo, a state established in present-day Manchuria around the time of Gojoseon's fall. Baekje alternately battled and allied with Goguryeo and Silla as the three kingdoms expanded control over the peninsula. At its peak in the 4th century, Baekje controlled most of the western Korean peninsula, as far north as Pyongyang, and may have even held territories in China, such as in Liaoxi, though this view is controversial. It became a significant regional sea power, with political and trade relations with China and Japan. Baekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. In 660, it was defeated by Tang Dynasty, and submitted to Unified Silla. History Envoys of Baekje =Founding= Mireuksa Neck Bolster of King Muryeong Baekje was founded in 18 BC by King Onjo, who led a group of people from Goguryeo south to the Han River basin. According to the Chinese Records of the Three Kingdoms, during the Samhan period, one of the chiefdoms of the Mahan confederacy was called already Baekje. The Samguk Sagi provides a detailed account of Baekje's founding. Jumong had left his son Yuri in Buyeo when he left that kingdom to establish the new kingdom of Goguryeo. Jumong became Divine King Dongmyeong, and had two more sons with So Seo-no, Onjo and Biryu. When Yuri later arrived in Goguryeo, Jumong promptly made him the crown prince. Realizing Yuri would become the next king, So Seo-no left Goguryeo, taking her two sons Biryu and Onjo south to found their own kingdoms with their people, along with ten vassals. She is remembered as a key figure in the founding of both Goguryeo and Baekje. Onjo settled in Wiryeseong (present-day Hanam), and called his country Sipje (Ïã≠Ï†ú, ÂçÅÊøü, meaning \\"Ten Vassals\\"), while Biryu settled in Michuhol (present-day Incheon), against the vassals' advice. The salty water and marshes in Michuhol made settlement difficult, while the people of Wiryeseong lived prosperously. Biryu then went to his brother Onjo, asking for the throne of Sipje. When Onjo refused, Biryu declared war, but lost. In shame, Biryu committed suicide, and his people moved to Wiryeseong, where King Onjo welcomed them and renamed his country Baekje (\\"Hundred Vassals\\"). King Onjo moved the capital from the south to the north of the Han river, and then south again, probably all within present Seoul, under pressure from other Mahan states. King Gaeru is believed to have moved the capital north of the river to Bukhansanseong in 132, probably in present-day Goyang to the northwest of Seoul. Through the early centuries of the Common Era, sometimes called the Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms Period, early Baekje gradually gained control over the other Mahan tribes. =Expansion= Korea in 375, The greatest territory expansion of Baekje. During the reign of King Goi (234‚Äì286), Baekje became a full-fledged kingdom, as it continued consolidating the Mahan confederacy. In 249, according to the ancient Japanese text Nihonshoki, Baekje's expansion reached the Gaya confederacy to its east, around the Nakdong River valley. Baekje is first described in Chinese records as a kingdom in 345. The first diplomatic missions from Baekje reached Japan around 367 (According to the Nihon Shoki : 247). King Geunchogo (346‚Äì375) expanded Baekje's territory to the north through war against Goguryeo, while annexing the remaining Mahan societies in the south. During Geunchogo's reign, the territories of Baekje included most of the western Korean Peninsula (except the two Pyeongan provinces), and in 371, Baekje defeated Goguryeo at Pyongyang. Baekje continued substantial trade with Goguryeo, and actively adopted Chinese culture and technology. Buddhism became the official state religion in 384. Baekje also became a sea power and continued mutual goodwill relationships with the Japanese rulers of the Kofun period, transmitting continental cultural influences to Japan. The Chinese writing system, Buddhism, advanced pottery, ceremonial burial, and other aspects of culture were introduced by aristocrats, artisans, scholars, and monks throughout their relationship.\\"Korean Buddhism Basis of Japanese Buddhism ,\\" Seoul Times, June 18, 2006; \\"Buddhist Art of Korea & Japan ,\\" Asia Society Museum; \\"Kanji ,\\" JapanGuide.com; \\"Pottery ,\\" MSN Encarta; 2009-10-31. During this period, the Han River basin remained the heartland of the country. =Ungjin period= In the 5th century, Baekje retreated under the southward military threat of Goguryeo, and in 475, the Seoul region fell to Goguryeo. Baekje's capital was located at Ungjin (present-day Gongju) from 475 to 538. Isolated in mountainous terrain, the new capital was secure against the north but also disconnected from the outside world. It was closer to Silla than Wiryeseong had been, however, and a military alliance was forged between Silla and Baekje against Goguryeo. Most maps of the Three Kingdoms period show Baekje occupying the Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces, the core of the country in the Ungjin and Sabi periods. =Sabi period= In 538, King Seong moved the capital to Sabi (present-day Buyeo County), and rebuilt his kingdom into a strong state. From this time, the official name of the country was Nambuyeo (\\"Southern Buyeo\\"), a reference to Buyeo to which Baekje traced its origins. The Sabi Period witnessed the flowering of Baekje culture, alongside the growth of Buddhism.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 119. Silk Pagoda (2006). Under pressure from Goguryeo to the north and Silla to the east, Seong sought to strengthen Baekje's relationship with China. The location of Sabi, on the navigable Geum River, made contact with China much easier, and both trade and diplomacy flourished during his reign and continuing on into the 7th century. In the 7th century, with the growing influence of Silla in the southern and central Korean peninsula, Baekje began its decline. =Fall and restoration movement= In 660, the coalition troops of Silla and Tang of China attacked Baekje, which was then allied with Goguryeo. A heavily outmanned army led by General Gyebaek was defeated in the Battle of Hwangsanbeol near Nonsan. The capital Sabi fell almost immediately thereafter, resulting in the annexation of Baekje by Silla. King Uija and his son Buyeo Yung were sent into exile in China while at least some of the ruling class fled to Japan. Baekje forces attempted a brief restoration movement but faced Silla‚ÄìTang joint forces. A Buddhist monk Dochim (ÎèÑÏπ®, ÈÅìÁêõ) and the former Baekje general Buyeo Boksin rose to try to revive Baekje. They welcomed the Baekje prince Buyeo Pung back from Japan to serve as king, with Juryu (Ï£ºÎ•ò, Âë®Áïô, in modern Seocheon County, South Chungcheong) as their headquarters. They put the Tang general Liu Renyuan (Âäâ‰ªÅÈ°ò) under siege in Sabi. Emperor Gaozong sent the general Liu Rengui, who had previously been demoted to commoner rank for offending Li Yifu, with a relief force, and Liu Rengui and Liu Renyuan were able to fight off the Baekje resistance forces' attacks, but were themselves not strong enough to quell the rebellion, and so for some time the armies were in stalemate. Baekje requested Japanese aid, and King Pung returned to Baekje with a contingent of 5,000 soldiers. Before the ships from Japan arrived, his forces battled a contingent of Tang forces in Ungjin County. In 663, Baekje revival forces and a Japanese naval fleet convened in southern Baekje to confront the Silla forces in the Battle of Baekgang. The Tang dynasty also sent 7,000 soldiers and 170 ships. After five naval confrontations that took place in August 663 at Baekgang, considered the lower reaches of Geum River or Dongjin river, the Silla‚ÄìTang forces emerged victorious, and Buyeo Pung escaped to Goguryeo. Social and political structure The establishment of a centralized state in Baekje is usually traced to the reign of King Goi, who may have first established patrilineal succession. Like most monarchies, a great deal of power was held by the aristocracy. King Seong, for example, strengthened royal power, but after he was slain in a disastrous campaign against Silla, the nobles took much of that power away from his son. The Hae clan and the Jin clan were the representative royal houses who had considerable power from the early period of Baekje, and they produced many queens over several generations. The Hae clan was probably the royal house before the Buyeo clan replaced them, and both clans appear descended from the lineage of Buyeo and Goguryeo. The \\"Great Eight Families\\" (Sa, Yeon, Hyeop, Hae, Jin, Guk, Mok, and Baek) were powerful nobles in the Sabi era, recorded in Chinese records such as Tongdian. Central government officials were divided into sixteen ranks, the six members of the top rank forming a type of cabinet, with the top official being elected every three years. In the Sol rank, the first (Jwapyeong) through the sixth (Naesol) officials were political, administrative, and military commanders. In the Deok rank, the seventh (Jangdeok) through the eleventh (Daedeok) officials may have headed each field. Mundok, Mudok, Jwagun, Jinmu and Geuku from the twelfth to the sixteenth, may have been military administrators. According to the Samguk Yusa,Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 121. Silk Pagoda (2006). during the Sabi period, the chief minister (Jaesang) of Baekje was chosen by a unique system. The names of several candidates were placed under a rock (Cheonjeongdae) near Hoamsa temple. After a few days, the rock was moved and the candidate whose name had a certain mark was chosen as the new chief minister. Whether this was a form of selection by lot or a covert selection by the elite is not clear. Military Language and culture Baekje was established by immigrants from Goguryeo who spoke what could be a Buyeo language, a hypothetical group linking the languages of Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje. In a case of diglossia, the indigenous Samhan people, having migrated in an earlier wave from the same region, probably spoke a variation or dialect of the same language. According some historians and linguists, Baekje was predominantly Japonic-speaking (see Peninsular Japonic) until it was conquered by proto-Koreans from further north.Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222‚Äì240. There is much evidence for Japonic topographical names in certain parts of the Peninsula. K≈çno Rokur≈ç and Kim Bang-han have argued for bilingualism in Baekje, with the placenames reflecting the language of the common people.Lee, Ki-Moon; Ramsey, S. Robert (2011), A History of the Korean Language, Cambridge University Press, . Baekje artists adopted many Chinese influences and synthesized them into a unique artistic tradition. Buddhist themes are extremely strong in Baekje artwork. The beatific Baekje smile found on many Buddhist sculptures expresses the warmth typical of Baekje art. Taoist influences are also widespread. Chinese artisans were sent to the kingdom by the Liang Dynasty in 541, and this may have given rise to an increased Chinese influence in the Sabi period. The tomb of King Muryeong (501‚Äì523), although modeled on Chinese brick tombs and yielding some imported Chinese objects, also contained many funerary objects of the Baekje tradition, such as the gold crown ornaments, gold belts, and gold earrings. Mortuary practices also followed the unique tradition of Baekje. This tomb is seen as a representative tomb of the Ungjin period. Delicate lotus designs of the roof-tiles, intricate brick patterns, curves of the pottery style, and flowing and elegant epitaph writing characterize Baekje culture. The Buddhist sculptures and refined pagodas reflect religion-inspired creativity. A splendid gilt-bronze incense burner ( Baekje Geumdong Daehyeongno) excavated from an ancient Buddhist temple site at Neungsan-ri, Buyeo County, exemplifies Baekje art. Little is known of Baekje music, but local musicians were sent with tribute missions to China in the 7th century, indicating that a distinctive musical tradition had developed by that time. Foreign relations =Relations with China= Ambassador of Baekje in China In 372, King Geunchogo paid tribute to the Jin Dynasty of China, located in the basin of the Yangtze River. After the fall of Jin and the establishment of Song Dynasty in 420, Baekje sent envoys seeking cultural goods and technologies. Baekje sent an envoy to Northern Wei of Northern Dynasties for the first time in 472, and King Gaero asked for military aid to attack Goguryeo. Kings Muryeong and Seong sent envoys to Liang several times and received titles of nobility. Tomb of King Muryeong is built with bricks according with Liang's tomb style. =Relations with Japan= Seven-pronged Sword Baekje gave to Yamato. Cultural Impact and Military assistance To confront the military pressure of Goguryeo to its north and Silla to its east, Baekje (Kudara in Japanese) established close relations with Japan. According to the Korean chronicle Samguk Sagi, Baekje and Silla sent some princes to the Japanese court as hostages. Whether the princes sent to Japan should be interpreted as diplomats as part of an embassy or literal hostages is debated.Hong Wontack 1994 Paekche of Korea and the origin of Yamato Japan , Seoul Kadura International Due to the confusion on the exact nature of this relationship (the question of whether the Baekje Koreans were family or at least close to the Japanese Imperial line or whether they were hostages) and the fact that the Nihon Shoki, a primary source of material for this relationship, is a compilation of myth, makes it difficult to evaluate. The Samguk Sagi, which also documents this, can also be interpreted in various ways and at any rate it was rewritten in the 13th century, easily seven or eight centuries after these particular events took place. Adding to the confusion is the discovery (in Japan) that the \\"Inariyama sword, as well as some other swords discovered in Japan, utilized the Korean 'Idu' system of writing\\". The swords \\"originated in Paekche and that the kings named in their inscriptions represent Paekche kings rather than Japanese kings\\". The techniques for making these swords were the apparently similar to styles from Korea, specifically from Baekje.5000 Years of Korean Martial ArtsKorean Impact (1984) In Japan, the hostage interpretation is dominant. Other historians, such as those who collaborated on 'Paekche of Korea and the Origin of Yamato Japan' and Jonathan W. Best, who helped translate what was left of the Baekje annals,Best JW 2007 A History of the Early Korean Kingdom of Paekche, together with an annotated translation of The Paekche Annals of the Samguk sagi (Harvard East Asian Monographs) Massachusetts, Harvard University, Asia studies have noted that these princes set up schools in Yamato Japan and took control of the Japanese naval forces during the war with Goguryeo, taking this as evidence of them being more along the lines of diplomats with some kind of familial tie to the Japanese imperial family and as evidence against any hostage status. In addition, the translation of the old documents is difficult because in the past, the term \\"Wa\\" was derogatory, meaning \\"midget\\" or \\"dwarf,\\" which was a reference to the perceived smaller stature of the average Japanese in ancient times. As a result, it is difficult to assess what is truly being stated, particularly in records made in Korea after the fall of Baekje, as the reference to Yamato Wa (Japan) could have been a derogatory statement by a rival nation (specifically Silla). As is with many long-past histories and competing records, very little can be definitively concluded. Further research has been difficult, in part due to the 1976 restriction on the study of royal tombs in Japan (to include tombs such as the Gosashi tomb, which is allegedly the resting place of Empress Jing≈´). Prior to 1976, foreign researchers did have access, and some found Korean artifacts in Japanese dig sites. Recently in 2008, Japan has allowed controlled limited access to foreign archaeologists, but the international community still has many unanswered questions. National Geographic has written that Japan \\"the agency has kept access to the tombs restricted, prompting rumors that officials fear excavation would reveal bloodline links between the \\"pure\\" imperial family and Korea‚Äîor that some tombs hold no royal remains at all.\\" Guze Kannon is a buddhist statue made in the image of King SeongËÅñÂÜèÊäÑ ...

According to mythical accounts in the controversial Nihon Shoki, Empress Jing≈´ extracted tribute and pledges of allegiance from the kings of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo. At the height of Japanese nationalism in the early 20th century, Japanese historians used these mythical accounts along with a passage in the Gwanggaeto Stele to establish ideological rationale to the imperialist outcry for invasion of Korea.Mohan, Pankaj N. \\"Rescuing a Stone from Nationalism: A Fresh Look at the Kwanggaeto Stele of Koguryo.\\" Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies, 1 (2004): 89‚Äì115.'Gina L. Barnes', \\"State Formation in Korea\\", 2001 Curzon Press Other historians have pointed out that there is no evidence of this Japanese account in any part of Korea, in addition to not being in any viable text in China or Korea.Lee (1997:31‚Äì35)K≈çz≈ç (1997:308‚Äì310) Regarding the Gwanggaeto Stele, because the lack of syntax and punctuation the text can be interpreted 4 different ways,Coval, Dr John Carter and Alan, 1984, \\"Korean impact on Japanese culture: Japan's hidden History\\" Hollym International Corp., Elizabeth, New Jersey one which states that Korea crossed the water and subjugated Yamato. Due to this problem in interpretation, nothing can be concluded. Also complicating the matter is that in the Nihongi a Korean named Amenohiboko is described in Nihon Shoki as a maternal predecessor of ,\\"Nihon Shoki Vol.6\\" \\"ÊòîÊúâ‰∏Ä‰∫∫ ‰πòËâáËÄåÊ≥ä‰∫é‰ΩÜÈ¶¨Âúã Âõ†ÂïèÊõ∞ Ê±ù‰ΩïÂúã‰∫∫‰πü Â∞çÊõ∞ Êñ∞ÁæÖÁéãÂ≠ê ÂêçÊõ∞ Â§©Êó•Êßç ÂâáÁïô‰∫é‰ΩÜÈ¶¨ Â®∂ÂÖ∂ÂúãÂâçÊ¥•ËÄ≥Â•≥ ‰∏Ä‰∫ë ÂâçÊ¥•Ë¶ã ‰∏Ä‰∫ë Â§™ËÄ≥ È∫ªÊãñËÉΩÁÉè Áîü ‰ΩÜÈ¶¨Ë´∏Âä© ÊòØÊ∏ÖÂΩ•‰πãÁ•ñÁà∂‰πü\\" This is highly inconsistent and difficult to interpret correctly. Scholars believe that the Nihon Shoki gives the invasion date of Silla and Baekje as the late 4th century. However, by this time, Japan was a confederation of local tribes without sophisticated iron weapons, while the Three Kingdoms of Korea were fully developed centralized powers with modern iron weapons and were already utilizing horses for warfare. It is very unlikely that a developing state such as Yamato had the capacity to cross the sea and engage in battles with Baekje and Silla.Grayson, James. \\"Mimana, A Problem in Korean Historiography,\\" Korea Journal, 17 (1977):65‚Äì69.'John Whitney Hall', \\"Cambridge History of Japan\\", 1988 Cambridge University Press The Nihon Shoki is widely regarded to be an unreliable and biased source of information on early relations with Korea, as it mixes heavy amounts of supposition and legend with facts.Lee, Hui Jin: Í±∞ÏßìÍ≥º Ïò§ÎßåÏùò Ïó≠ÏÇ¨, Random house Joongang,2001.

However, Mohan claims that Goguryeo fabricated the Japanese invasion in order to justify its conquest of Baekje. If this stele was a dedication to a Korean king, it can be argued that it would logically highlight Korea's conquests and not dedicate it to a strange incident regarding Japan. In any case, because of these various possible interpretations, the circumstances surrounding the stele are still highly debated and inconclusive. Chinese scholars participated in the study of the Stele during the 1980s. Wang Jianqun interviewed local farmers and decided that no intentional fabrication occurred, adding that the lime on the Stele was pasted by local copy-making workers to enhance readability.Â•ΩÂ§™ÁéãÁ¢ëÁ†îÁ©∂, ÁéãÂÅ•Áæ§, 1984, ÂêâÊûó‰∫∫Ê∞ë Xu Jianxin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences discovered the earliest rubbed copy which was made before 1881.

The fall of Baekje and the military support from Japan Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror looks like mirrors of Baekje Some members of the Baekje nobility and royalty emigrated to Japan even before the kingdom was overthrown. In response to Baekje's request, Japan in 663 sent the general Abe no Hirafu with 20,000 troops and 1,000 ships to revive Baekje with Buyeo Pung (known in Japanese as H≈çsh≈ç), a son of Uija of Baekje who had been an emissary to Japan. Around August 661, 10,000 soldiers and 170 ships, led by Abe no Hirafu, arrived. Additional Japanese reinforcement, including 27,000 soldiers led by Kamitsukeno no Kimi Wakako (‰∏äÊØõÈáéÂêõÁ®öÂ≠ê) and 10,000 soldiers led by Iohara no Kimi (Âª¨ÂéüÂêõ) also arrived at Baekje in 662. This attempt, however, failed at the Battle of Baekgang, and the prince escaped to Goguryeo. According to the Nihon Shoki, 400 Japanese ships were lost in the battles. Only half of the troops were able to return to Japan. The Japanese army retreated to Japan with many Baekje refugees. The former royal family members were initially treated as \\"foreign guests\\" (ËïÉÂÆ¢) and were not incorporated into the political system of Japan for some time. Buyeo Pung's younger brother Seon'gwang (Zenk≈ç in Japanese) ( or ) used the family name Kudara no Konikishi (\\"King of Baekje\\") () (they are also called the Kudara clan, as Baekje was called Kudara in Japanese). Legacy Baekje Cultural Land Baekje was briefly revived in the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea period, as Unified Silla collapsed. In 892, General Gyeon Hwon established Hubaekje (‚ÄúLater Baekje‚Äù), based in Wansan (present-day Jeonju). Hubaekje was overthrown in 936 by King Taejo of Goryeo. In contemporary South Korea, Baekje relics are often symbolic of the local cultures of the southwest, especially in Chungnam and Jeolla. The gilt-bronze incense burner, for example, is a key symbol of Buyeo County, and the Baekje-era Buddhist rock sculpture of Seosan Maaesamjonbulsang is an important symbol of Seosan City. Baekje is believed to have introduced the man'y≈çgana writing system to Japan, of which the modern hiragana and katakana scripts are descendants. Kojiki and the Nihon shoki both state this, and though direct evidence is hard to come by, most scholars tend to accept this idea. On 17 April 2009, ≈åuchi Kimio (Â§ßÂÖßÂÖ¨Â§´) of ≈åuchi clan visited Iksan, Korea to pay tribute to his Baekje ancestors. The ≈åuchi are descendants of Prince Imseong.ÏïºÌõÑ! Í≤ÄÏÉâ - ÌÜµÌï© Í≤ÄÏÉâ.

The downward flow of the ore along with the flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.Development of heat transfer circuits in the blast furnace, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering In contrast, air furnaces (such as reverberatory furnaces) are naturally aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.P J Wand, \\"Copper smelting at Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Ltd., Port Kembla, N.S.W.\\", in: Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia: The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Ed J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 335‚Äì340.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 9‚Äì12. Process engineering and chemistry Blast furnaces of T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works, Czech Republic Blast furnaces operate on the principle of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does, reduces the iron to its elemental form. Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. The blast furnace operates as a countercurrent exchange process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process while blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult to start up and shut down. (See: Continuous production) Also, the carbon in pig iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast, iron does not melt in a bloomery. Silica has to be removed from the pig iron. It reacts with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a silicate which floats to the surface of the molten pig iron as \\"slag\\". Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal. The downward moving column of ore, flux, coke or charcoal and reaction products must be porous enough for the flue gas to pass through. This requires the coke or charcoal to be in large enough particles to be permeable, meaning there cannot be an excess of fine particles. Therefore, the coke must be strong enough so it will not be crushed by the weight of the material above it. Besides physical strength of the coke, it must also be low in sulfur, phosphorus, and ash. This necessitates the use of metallurgical coal, which is a premium grade due to its relative scarcity. The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is: :Fe2O3 \\\\+ 3CO ‚Üí 2Fe + 3CO2 This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that preheated blast air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form of coke to produce carbon monoxide and heat: :2 C(s) \\\\+ O2(g) ‚Üí 2 CO(g) The hot carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for the iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide. Depending on the temperature in the different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200 ¬∞C and 700 ¬∞C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4. :3 Fe2O3(s) \\\\+ CO(g) ‚Üí 2 Fe3O4(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) At temperatures around 850 ¬∞C, further down in the furnace, the iron(II,III) is reduced further to iron(II) oxide: :Fe3O4(s) \\\\+ CO(g) ‚Üí 3 FeO(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) Hot carbon dioxide, unreacted carbon monoxide, and nitrogen from the air pass up through the furnace as fresh feed material travels down into the reaction zone. As the material travels downward, the counter-current gases both preheat the feed charge and decompose the limestone to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide: :CaCO3(s) ‚Üí CaO(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) The calcium oxide formed by decomposition reacts with various acidic impurities in the iron (notably silica), to form a fayalitic slag which is essentially calcium silicate, : :SiO2 \\\\+ CaO ‚Üí CaSiO3Dr. K. E. Lee, Form Two Science (Biology Chemistry Physics) As the iron(II) oxide moves down to the area with higher temperatures, ranging up to 1200 ¬∞C degrees, it is reduced further to iron metal: :FeO(s) \\\\+ CO(g) ‚Üí Fe(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) The carbon dioxide formed in this process is re-reduced to carbon monoxide by the coke: :C(s) \\\\+ CO2(g) ‚Üí 2 CO(g) The temperature-dependent equilibrium controlling the gas atmosphere in the furnace is called the Boudouard reaction: ::2CO CO2 \\\\+ C The \\"pig iron\\" produced by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon content of around 4‚Äì5% and usually contains too much sulphur, making it very brittle, and of limited immediate commercial use. Some pig iron is used to make cast iron. The majority of pig iron produced by blast furnaces undergoes further processing to reduce the carbon and sulphur content and produce various grades of steel used for construction materials, automobiles, ships and machinery. Desulphurisation usually takes place during the transport of the liquid steel to the steelworks. This is done by adding calcium oxide, which reacts with the iron sulfide contained in the pig iron to form calcium sulfide (called lime desulfurization). In a further process step, the so-called basic oxygen steelmaking, the carbon is oxidized by blowing oxygen onto the liquid pig iron to form crude steel. Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is constantly evolving, the chemical process inside the blast furnace remains the same. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute: \\"Blast furnaces will survive into the next millennium because the larger, efficient furnaces can produce hot metal at costs competitive with other iron making technologies.\\" One of the biggest drawbacks of the blast furnaces is the inevitable carbon dioxide production as iron is reduced from iron oxides by carbon and as of 2016, there is no economical substitute ‚Äì steelmaking is one of the largest industrial contributors of the CO2 emissions in the world (see greenhouse gases). The challenge set by the greenhouse gas emissions of the blast furnace is being addressed in an ongoing European Program called ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking).http://www.ulcos.org Several new process routes have been proposed and investigated in depth to cut specific emissions ( per ton of steel) by at least 50%. Some rely on the capture and further storage (CCS) of , while others choose decarbonizing iron and steel production, by turning to hydrogen, electricity and biomass.ICIT-Revue de M√©tallurgie, September and October issues, 2009 In the nearer term, a technology that incorporates CCS into the blast furnace process itself and is called the Top-Gas Recycling Blast Furnace is under development, with a scale-up to a commercial size blast furnace under way. The technology should be fully demonstrated by the end of the 2010s, in line with the timeline set, for example, by the EU to cut emissions significantly. Broad deployment could take place from 2020 on. History An illustration of furnace bellows operated by waterwheels, from the Nong Shu, by Wang Zhen, 1313, during the Yuan Dynasty of China Chinese fining and blast furnace, Tiangong Kaiwu, 1637. Cast iron has been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, but the earliest extant blast furnaces in China date to the 1st century AD and in the West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to English inventor Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by Scottish inventor James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.Simcoe, Charles R. \\"The Age of Steel: Part II.\\" Advanced Materials & Processes 172.4 (2014): 32-33. Academic Search Premier. = China = Archaeological evidence shows that bloomeries appeared in China around 800 BC. Originally it was thought that the Chinese started casting iron right from the beginning, but this theory has since been debunked by the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BC), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).\\"The Earliest Use of Iron in China\\" by Donald B. Wagner in Metals in Antiquity, by Suzanne M. M. Young, A. Mark Pollard, Paul Budd and Robert A. Ixer (BAR International Series, 792), Oxford: Archaeopress, 1999, pp. 1‚Äì9. There is however no evidence of the bloomery in China after the appearance of the blast furnace and cast iron. In China, blast furnaces produced cast iron, which was then either converted into finished implements in a cupola furnace, or turned into wrought iron in a fining hearth. Although cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th century BC, employing workforces of over 200 men in iron smelters from the 3rd century onward, the earliest blast furnaces constructed were attributed to the Han Dynasty in the 1st century AD.Ebrey, p. 30. These early furnaces had clay walls and used phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux.Early iron in China, Korea, and Japan , Donald B. Wagner, March 1993 Chinese blast furnaces ranged from around two to ten meters in height, depending on the region. The largest ones were found in modern Sichuan and Guangdong, while the 'dwarf\\" blast furnaces were found in Dabieshan. In construction, they are both around the same level of technological sophistication The effectiveness of the Chinese human and horse powered blast furnaces was enhanced during this period by the engineer Du Shi (c. AD 31), who applied the power of waterwheels to piston- bellows in forging cast iron. Early water-driven reciprocators for operating blast furnaces were built according to the structure of horse powered reciprocators that already existed. That is, the circular motion of the wheel, be it horse driven or water driven, was transferred by the combination of a belt drive, a crank-and-connecting-rod, other connecting rods, and various shafts, into the reciprocal motion necessary to operate a push bellow.. Donald Wagner suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221 BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a switch of resources from charcoal to coke in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.Donald B. Wagner, 'Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century' Historical Metallurgy 37(1) (2003), 25‚Äì37; originally published in West Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine 18 (2001), 41‚Äì74.Ebrey, p. 158. The primary advantage of the early blast furnace was in large scale production and making iron implements more readily available to peasants. Cast iron is more brittle than wrought iron or steel, which required additional fining and then cementation or co-fusion to produce, but for menial activities such as farming it sufficed. By using the blast furnace, it was possible to produce larger quantities of tools such as ploughshares more efficiently than the bloomery. In areas where quality was important, such as warfare, wrought iron and steel were preferred. Nearly all Han period weapons are made of wrought iron or steel, with the exception of axe-heads, of which many are made of cast iron. Blast furnaces were also later used to produce gunpowder weapons such as cast iron bomb shells and cast iron cannons during the Song dynasty. = Medieval Europe = The simplest forge, known as the Corsican, was used prior to the advent of Christianity. Examples of improved bloomeries are the (sometimes called wolf-furnaceDouglas Alan Fisher, Excerpt from The Epic of Steel , Davis Town Museum & Harper & Row, NY 1963.), which remained until the beginning of the 19th century. Instead of using natural draught, air was pumped in by a trompe, resulting in better quality iron and an increased capacity. This pumping of airstream in with bellows is known as cold blast, and it increases the fuel efficiency of the bloomery and improves yield. They can also be built bigger than natural draught bloomeries. Oldest European blast furnaces The first blast furnace of Germany as depicted in a miniature in the Deutsches MuseumThe oldest known blast furnaces in the West were built in D√ºrstel in Switzerland, the M√§rkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden, where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300.Jockenh√∂vel, Albrecht et al. (1997) \\"Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe\\" Abteilung f√ºr Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichtliche Arch√§ologie, Westf√§lische Wilhelms-Universit√§t M√ºnster; abstract published as: Jockenh√∂vel, A. (1997) \\"Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace- Technology in Central Europe\\" pp. 56‚Äì58 In Crew, Peter and Crew, Susan (editors) (1997) Early Ironworking in Europe: Archaeology and Experiment: Abstracts of the International Conference at Plas Tan y Bwlch 19‚Äì25 September 1997 (Plas Tan y Bwlch Occasional Papers No 3) Snowdonia National Park Study Centre, Gwynedd, Wales, ; archived here by WebCite on 11 March 2012 At Noraskog in the Swedish parish of J√§rnbo√•s, there have also been found traces of blast furnaces dating even earlier, possibly to around 1100.A. Wetterholm, 'Blast furnace studies in Nora bergslag' (√ñrebro universitet 1999, J√§rn och Samh√§lle) These early blast furnaces, like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of wrought iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally ‚Äì a possible reference occurs in a treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in Westphalia.N. Bj√∂kenstam, 'The Blast Furnace in Europe during the Middle Ages: part of a new system for producing wrought iron' in G. Magnusson, The Importance of Ironmaking: Technological Innovation and Social Change I (Jernkontoret, Stockholm 1995), 143‚Äì53 and other papers in the same volume. The technology required for blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or may have been an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high.Wagner 2008, 349‚Äì51. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route), it is possible that the technology reached Sweden by this means.Wagner 2008, 354. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron, and cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast. The Caspian region may also have been the source for the design of the furnace at Ferriere, described by Filarete,Wagner 2008, 355. involving a water-powered bellows at in Valdidentro in northern Italy in 1226 in a two- stage process. With this process, the molten iron was tapped twice a day into water, thereby granulating it.B. G. Awty, 'The blast funace in the Renaissance period: haut fournau or fonderie ', Transactions of Newcomen Society 61 (1989‚Äì90). 67. Cistercian contributions One means by which certain technological advances were spread within Europe was a result of the General Chapter of the Cistercian monks. This may have included the blast furnace, as the Cistercians are known to have been skilled metallurgists.Woods, p. 34. According to Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: \\"Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor.\\" Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron, and within time surpluses were being offered for sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne, France, from the mid-13th century to the 17th century,Gimpel, p. 67. also using the phosphate- rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer.Woods, p. 35. Archaeologists are still discovering the extent of Cistercian technology.Woods, p. 36. At Laskill, an outstation of Rievaulx Abbey and the only medieval blast furnace so far identified in Britain, the slag produced was low in iron content.Woods, p. 37. Slag from other furnaces of the time contained a substantial concentration of iron, whereas Laskill is believed to have produced cast iron quite efficiently.David Derbyshire, 'Henry \\"Stamped Out Industrial Revolution\\"' , The Daily Telegraph (21 June 2002); cited by Woods. Its date is not yet clear, but it probably did not survive until Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries in the late 1530s, as an agreement (immediately after that) concerning the \\"smythes\\" with the Earl of Rutland in 1541 refers to blooms. Nevertheless, the means by which the blast furnace spread in medieval Europe has not finally been determined.  Origin and spread of early modern blast furnaces  Period drawing of an 18th-century blast furnace Due to the casting of cannon, the blast furnace came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century. The direct ancestor of these used in France and England was in the Namur region in what is now Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.B. Awty & C. Whittick (with P. Combes), 'The Lordship of Canterbury, iron-founding at Buxted, and the continental antecedents of cannon-founding in the Weald' Sussex Archaeological Collections 140 (2004 for 2002), pp. 71‚Äì81. The first British furnaces outside the Weald appeared during the 1550s, and many were built in the remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew.P. W. King, 'The production and consumption of iron in early modern England and Wales' Economic History Review LVIII(1), 1‚Äì33; G. Hammersley, 'The charcoal iron industry and its fuel 1540‚Äì1750' Economic History Review Ser. II, XXVI (1973), pp. 593‚Äì613. The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example. The first blast furnace in Russia opened in 1637 near Tula and was called the Gorodishche Works. The blast furnace spread from here to central Russia and then finally to the Urals. = Coke blast furnaces = Madeley, England Charging the experimental blast furnace, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, Washington D.C., 1930 In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham Darby began to fuel a blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal. Coke's initial advantage was its lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of wood, especially in Britain and on the Continent. Metallurgical grade coke will bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces. A disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with sulfur being especially detrimental to the iron's quality. Coke's impurities were more of a problem before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before furnace temperatures were hot enough to make slag from limestone free flowing. (Limestone ties up sulfur. Manganese may also be added to tie up sulfur). Coke iron was initially only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work was a minor branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke pig iron for the production of bar iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial Revolution.Hyde Darby's original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians. =Steam- powered blast= The steam engine was applied to power blast air, overcoming a shortage of water power in areas where coal and iron ore were located. The cast iron blowing cylinder was developed in 1768 to replace the leather bellows, which wore out quickly. The steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder led to a large increase in British iron production in the late 18th century. =Hot blast= Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace and was one of the most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland in 1828. Within a few years of the introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity was also significantly increased. Within a few decades, the practice was to have a \\"stove\\" as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt. The resultant heat was used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.Birch, pp. 181‚Äì9. Hot blast enabled the use of raw anthracite coal, which was difficult to light, to the blast furnace. Anthracite was first tried successfully by George Crane at Ynyscedwyn Ironworks in south Wales in 1837.Hyde, p. 159. It was taken up in America by the Lehigh Crane Iron Company at Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, in 1839. Anthracite use declined when very high capacity blast furnaces requiring coke were built in the 1870s. =Modern furnaces= Iron blast furnaces The blast furnace remains an important part of modern iron production. Modern furnaces are highly efficient, including Cowper stoves to pre-heat the blast air and employ recovery systems to extract the heat from the hot gases exiting the furnace. Competition in industry drives higher production rates. The largest blast furnace in the world is in South Korea, with a volume around . It can produce around of iron per year. This is a great increase from the typical 18th-century furnaces, which averaged about per year. Variations of the blast furnace, such as the Swedish electric blast furnace, have been developed in countries which have no native coal resources. Lead blast furnaces Blast furnaces are currently rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 75. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 77. Modern lead blast furnaces are constructed using water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 76. The blast furnace used at the Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast furnaces in that it has a double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with the lower part of the shaft being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard. Zinc blast furnaces (Imperial Smelting Furnaces) The blast furnaces used in the Imperial Smelting Process (\\"ISP\\") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 89. This is because the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, and the presence of oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide. Blast furnaces used in the ISP have a more intense operation than standard lead blast furnaces, with higher air blast rates per m2 of hearth area and a higher coke consumption. Zinc production with the ISP is more expensive than with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years.R J Sinclair, The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 90. However, ISP furnaces have the advantage of being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants. Modern process Blast furnace placed in an installation Blast furnace diagram Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought to the top of the blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.American Iron and Steel Institute (2005). How a Blast Furnace Works. steel.org. There are different ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a \\"double bell\\" system where two \\"bells\\" are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a \\"bell-less\\" system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the charge is placed. The iron making blast furnace itself is built in the form of a tall structure, lined with refractory brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four \\"uptakes\\" allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while \\"bleeder valves\\" protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the \\"dust catcher\\" and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a venturi scrubber and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas. The \\"casthouse\\" at the bottom half of the furnace contains the bustle pipe, water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid iron and slag. Once a \\"taphole\\" is drilled through the refractory clay plug, liquid iron and slag flow down a trough through a \\"skimmer\\" opening, separating the iron and slag. Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two casthouses. Once the pig iron and slag has been tapped, the taphole is again plugged with refractory clay. Tuyeres of Blast Furnace at Gerdau, Brazil The tuyeres are used to implement a hot blast, which is used to increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900 ¬∞C to 1300 ¬∞C (1600 ¬∞F to 2300 ¬∞F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000 ¬∞C to 2300 ¬∞C (3600 ¬∞F to 4200 ¬∞F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity. Manufacture of stone wool Stone wool or rock wool is a spun mineral fibre used as an insulation product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product. Decommissioned blast furnaces as museum sites For a long time, it was normal procedure for a decommissioned blast furnace to be demolished and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. In recent decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned steel mills were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other such sites exist in Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia and the United States.  Gas cleaning systems  The blast furnace gas can be used to generate heat. So by reducing the constituents in blast furnace gas we can increase the calorific value and can be used to generate heat and rise the temperature in any furnace. The gas cleaning system contains two stages, the coarse cleaning system and the fine cleaning system. In the coarse cleaning system a dust catcher is used. A dust catcher is a cylindrical steel structure with conical top and bottom sections. It is also lined with refractory bricks. thumb The principle of the dust catcher is that the dust-laden gas is given a sudden reverse in speed and direction. Because of their mass, the coarse dust particles cannot change their velocity easily, and hence settle to the bottom.

His works include the ƒÄryabha·π≠ƒ´ya (which mentions that in 3600 Kaliyuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta. For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.S. Kak, Aryabhatiya. Encyclopedia of India, 2005 Biography =Name= While there is a tendency to misspell his name as \\"Aryabhatta\\" by analogy with other names having the \\"bhatta\\" suffix, his name is properly spelled Aryabhata: every astronomical text spells his name thus, including Brahmagupta's references to him \\"in more than a hundred places by name\\". Furthermore, in most instances \\"Aryabhatta\\" would not fit the metre either. =Time and place of birth= Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, but this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476. Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar). Other hypothesis BhƒÅskara I describes Aryabhata as ƒÅ≈õmakƒ´ya, \\"one belonging to the A≈õmaka country.\\" During the Buddha's time, a branch of the A≈õmaka people settled in the region between the Narmada and Godavari rivers in central India. It has been claimed that the a≈õmaka (Sanskrit for \\"stone\\") where Aryabhata originated may be the present day Kodungallur which was the historical capital city of Thiruvanchikkulam of ancient Kerala. This is based on the belief that Ko·π≠u·πÖ·πÖall≈´r was earlier known as Ko·π≠um-Kal-l-≈´r (\\"city of hard stones\\"); however, old records show that the city was actually Ko·π≠um-kol-≈´r (\\"city of strict governance\\"). Similarly, the fact that several commentaries on the Aryabhatiya have come from Kerala has been used to suggest that it was Aryabhata's main place of life and activity; however, many commentaries have come from outside Kerala, and the Aryasiddhanta was completely unknown in Kerala. K. Chandra Hari has argued for the Kerala hypothesis on the basis of astronomical evidence. Aryabhata mentions \\"Lanka\\" on several occasions in the Aryabhatiya, but his \\"Lanka\\" is an abstraction, standing for a point on the equator at the same longitude as his Ujjayini.See: * *: \\"In Indian astronomy, the prime meridian is the great circle of the Earth passing through the north and south poles, Ujjayinƒ´ and La·πÖkƒÅ, where La·πÖkƒÅ was assumed to be on the Earth's equator.\\" *: \\"Seven cardinal points are then defined on the equator, one of them called La·πÖkƒÅ, at the intersection of the equator with the meridional line through Ujjaini. This La·πÖkƒÅ is, of course, a fanciful name and has nothing to do with the island of Sri La·πÖkƒÅ.\\" *: \\"The point on the equator that is below the city of Ujjain is known, according to the Siddhantas, as Lanka. (This is not the Lanka that is now known as Sri Lanka; Aryabhata is very clear in stating that Lanka is 23 degrees south of Ujjain.)\\" =Education= It is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time. Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as BhƒÅskara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as PƒÅ·π≠aliputra, modern Patna. A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (') at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time and had an astronomical observatory, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well. Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar. Works Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost. His major work, Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was extensively referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines. The Arya-siddhanta, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I. This work appears to be based on the older Surya Siddhanta and uses the midnight-day reckoning, as opposed to sunrise in Aryabhatiya. It also contained a description of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon (shanku-yantra), a shadow instrument (chhAyA-yantra), possibly angle-measuring devices, semicircular and circular (dhanur-yantra / chakra-yantra), a cylindrical stick yasti-yantra, an umbrella-shaped device called the chhatra-yantra, and water clocks of at least two types, bow-shaped and cylindrical. A third text, which may have survived in the Arabic translation, is Al ntf or Al-nanf. It claims that it is a translation by Aryabhata, but the Sanskrit name of this work is not known. Probably dating from the 9th century, it is mentioned by the Persian scholar and chronicler of India, Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´. =Aryabhatiya= Direct details of Aryabhata's work are known only from the Aryabhatiya. The name \\"Aryabhatiya\\" is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it Ashmakatantra (or the treatise from the Ashmaka). It is also occasionally referred to as Arya-shatas-aShTa (literally, Aryabhata's 108), because there are 108 verses in the text. It is written in the very terse style typical of sutra literature, in which each line is an aid to memory for a complex system. Thus, the explication of meaning is due to commentators. The text consists of the 108 verses and 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four pƒÅdas or chapters: # Gitikapada: (13 verses): large units of time‚Äîkalpa, manvantra, and yuga‚Äîwhich present a cosmology different from earlier texts such as Lagadha's Vedanga Jyotisha (c. 1st century BCE). There is also a table of sines (jya), given in a single verse. The duration of the planetary revolutions during a mahayuga is given as 4.32 million years. # Ganitapada (33 verses): covering mensuration (k·π£etra vyƒÅvahƒÅra), arithmetic and geometric progressions, gnomon / shadows (shanku-chhAyA), simple, quadratic, simultaneous, and indeterminate equations (ku·π≠·π≠aka). # Kalakriyapada (25 verses): different units of time and a method for determining the positions of planets for a given day, calculations concerning the intercalary month (adhikamAsa), kShaya-tithis, and a seven-day week with names for the days of week. # Golapada (50 verses): Geometric/trigonometric aspects of the celestial sphere, features of the ecliptic, celestial equator, node, shape of the earth, cause of day and night, rising of zodiacal signs on horizon, etc. In addition, some versions cite a few colophons added at the end, extolling the virtues of the work, etc. The Aryabhatiya presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple Bhaskara I (Bhashya, c. 600 CE) and by Nilakantha Somayaji in his Aryabhatiya Bhasya, (1465 CE). The Aryabhatiya is also remarkable for its description of relativity of motion. He expressed this relativity thus: \\"Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects (on the shore) as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people on earth as moving exactly towards the west.\\" Mathematics =Place value system and zero= The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients. However, Aryabhata did not use the Brahmi numerals. Continuing the Sanskritic tradition from Vedic times, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities, such as the table of sines in a mnemonic form. =Approximation of œÄ= Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (œÄ), and may have come to the conclusion that œÄ is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam ( 10), he writes: > ' > ' > \\"Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the > circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.\\" This implies that for a circle whose diameter is 20000, the circumference will be 62832 i.e, \\\\pi = 62832 \\\\over 20000 = 3.1416 , which is accurate to three decimal places. It is speculated that Aryabhata used the word ƒÅsanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational). If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, because the irrationality of pi (œÄ) was proved in Europe only in 1761 by Lambert. After Aryabhatiya was translated into Arabic (c. 820 CE) this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra. =Trigonometry= In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as : '''' that translates to: \\"for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area.\\" Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means \\"half- chord\\". For simplicity, people started calling it jya. When Arabic writers translated his works from Sanskrit into Arabic, they referred it as jiba. However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as jb. Later writers substituted it with jaib, meaning \\"pocket\\" or \\"fold (in a garment)\\". (In Arabic, jiba is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jaib with its Latin counterpart, sinus, which means \\"cove\\" or \\"bay\\"; thence comes the English word sine. =Indeterminate equations= A problem of great interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c. (This problem was also studied in ancient Chinese mathematics, and its solution is usually referred to as the Chinese remainder theorem.) This is an example from BhƒÅskara's commentary on Aryabhatiya: : Find the number which gives 5 as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as the remainder when divided by 9, and 1 as the remainder when divided by 7 That is, find N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85. In general, diophantine equations, such as this, can be notoriously difficult. They were discussed extensively in ancient Vedic text Sulba Sutras, whose more ancient parts might date to 800 BCE. Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the ' (‡§ï‡•Å‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü‡§ï) method. Ku·π≠·π≠aka means \\"pulverizing\\" or \\"breaking into small pieces\\", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was called ku·π≠·π≠aka-ga·πáita or simply ku·π≠·π≠aka. Amartya K Dutta,  \\"Diophantine equations: The Kuttaka\\" , Resonance, October 2002. Also see earlier overview: Mathematics in Ancient India . =Algebra= In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes: :1^2 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + n^2 = {n(n + 1)(2n + 1) \\\\over 6} and :1^3 + 2^3 + \\\\cdots + n^3 = (1 + 2 + \\\\cdots + n)^2 (see squared triangular number) Astronomy Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the audAyaka system, in which days are reckoned from uday, dawn at lanka or \\"equator\\". Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or ardha-rAtrikA, midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka. In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the Earth's rotation. He may have believed that the planet's orbits as elliptical rather than circular.J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, Aryabhata the Elder , MacTutor History of Mathematics archive: Hayashi (2008), Aryabhata I =Motions of the solar system= Aryabhata correctly insisted that the earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated.How Aryabhata got the earth's circumference right This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives the number of rotations of the earth in a yuga,Aryabhatiya 1.3ab, see Plofker 2009, p. 111. and made more explicit in his gola chapter:[achalAni bhAni samapashchimagAni ... ‚Äì golapAda.9‚Äì10]. Translation from K. S. Shukla and K.V. Sarma, K. V. ƒÄryabha·π≠ƒ´ya of ƒÄryabha·π≠a, New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1976. Quoted in Plofker 2009. Aryabhata described a geocentric model of the solar system, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the PaitƒÅmahasiddhƒÅnta (c. CE 425), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller manda (slow) and a larger ≈õƒ´ghra (fast). pp. 127‚Äì9. The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the asterisms.\\" The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet's motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two- epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy.Otto Neugebauer, \\"The Transmission of Planetary Theories in Ancient and Medieval Astronomy,\\" Scripta Mathematica, 22 (1956), pp. 165‚Äì192; reprinted in Otto Neugebauer, Astronomy and History: Selected Essays, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1983, pp. 129‚Äì156. Another element in Aryabhata's model, the ≈õƒ´ghrocca, the basic planetary period in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying heliocentric model.Hugh Thurston, Early Astronomy, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1996, pp. 178‚Äì189. =Eclipses= Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu (identified as the pseudo- planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Thus, the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth's shadow (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the size and extent of the Earth's shadow (verses gola.38‚Äì48) and then provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the core. His computational paradigm was so accurate that 18th-century scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds. =Sidereal periods= Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the sidereal rotation (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds (365.25858 days)Ansari, p. 13, Table 1 is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).Aryabhatiya , Mohan Apte, Pune, India, Rajhans Publications, 2009, p.25, =Heliocentrism= As mentioned, Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model also gave corrections (the ≈õƒ´gra anomaly) for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean speed of the Sun. Thus, it has been suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on an underlying heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun,The concept of Indian heliocentrism has been advocated by B. L. van der Waerden, Das heliozentrische System in der griechischen, persischen und indischen Astronomie. Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Z√ºrich. Z√ºrich:Kommissionsverlag Leeman AG, 1970.B.L. van der Waerden, \\"The Heliocentric System in Greek, Persian and Hindu Astronomy\\", in David A. King and George Saliba, ed., From Deferent to Equant: A Volume of Studies in the History of Science in the Ancient and Medieval Near East in Honor of E. S. Kennedy, Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 500 (1987), pp. 529‚Äì534. though this has been rebutted.Noel Swerdlow, \\"Review: A Lost Monument of Indian Astronomy,\\" Isis, 64 (1973): 239‚Äì243. It has also been suggested that aspects of Aryabhata's system may have been derived from an earlier, likely pre-Ptolemaic Greek, heliocentric model of which Indian astronomers were unaware,Though Aristarchus of Samos (3rd century BCE) is credited with holding an heliocentric theory, the version of Greek astronomy known in ancient India as the Paulisa Siddhanta makes no reference to such a theory. though the evidence is scant.Dennis Duke, \\"The Equant in India: The Mathematical Basis of Ancient Indian Planetary Models.\\" Archive for History of Exact Sciences 59 (2005): 563‚Äì576, n. 4 . The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata's system was not explicitly heliocentric. Legacy India's first satellite named after Aryabhata Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age (c. 820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis. His definitions of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), versine (utkrama-jya), and inverse sine (otkram jya) influenced the birth of trigonometry. He was also the first to specify sine and versine (1 ‚àí cos x) tables, in 3.75¬∞ intervals from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places. In fact, modern names \\"sine\\" and \\"cosine\\" are mistranscriptions of the words jya and kojya as introduced by Aryabhata. As mentioned, they were translated as jiba and kojiba in Arabic and then misunderstood by Gerard of Cremona while translating an Arabic geometry text to Latin. He assumed that jiba was the Arabic word jaib, which means \\"fold in a garment\\", L. sinus (c. 1150). Aryabhata's astronomical calculation methods were also very influential. Along with the trigonometric tables, they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to compute many Arabic astronomical tables (zijes). In particular, the astronomical tables in the work of the Arabic Spain scientist Al-Zarqali (11th century) were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo (12th century) and remained the most accurate ephemeris used in Europe for centuries. Calendric calculations devised by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for the practical purposes of fixing the Panchangam (the Hindu calendar). In the Islamic world, they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar introduced in 1073 CE by a group of astronomers including Omar Khayyam, versions of which (modified in 1925) are the national calendars in use in Iran and Afghanistan today. The dates of the Jalali calendar are based on actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata and earlier Siddhanta calendars. This type of calendar requires an ephemeris for calculating dates. Although dates were difficult to compute, seasonal errors were less in the Jalali calendar than in the Gregorian calendar. Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), Patna has been established by Government of Bihar for the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management and allied professional education in his honour. The university is governed by Bihar State University Act 2008. India's first satellite Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata are both named in his honour. An Institute for conducting research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) near Nainital, India. The inter-school Aryabhata Maths Competition is also named after him, as is Bacillus aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in the stratosphere by ISRO scientists in 2009.

He is the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta (BSS, \\"correctly established doctrine of Brahma\\", dated 628), a theoretical treatise, and the Kha·πá·∏çakhƒÅdyaka (\\"edible bite\\", dated 665), a more practical text. Brahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with zero. The texts composed by Brahmagupta were in elliptic verse in Sanskrit, as was common practice in Indian mathematics. As no proofs are given, it is not known how Brahmagupta's results were derived.Brahmagupta biography, Article by: J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland, November 2000 Life and career Brahmagupta was born in 598 CE according to his own statement. He lived in BhillamƒÅla, Gurjaradesa (modern Bhinmal in Rajasthan, India) during the reign of the Chavda dynasty ruler, Vyagrahamukha. He was the son of Jishnugupta and was a Hindu by religion, in particular, a Shaivite.: \\"Brahmagupta, one of the most celebrated mathematicians of the East, indeed of the world, was born in the year 598 CE, in the town of Bhillamala during the reign of King Vyaghramukh of the Chapa Dynasty.\\" He lived and worked there for a good part of his life. Prithudaka Svamin, a later commentator, called him Bhillamalacharya, the teacher from Bhillamala. Bhillamala was the capital of the Gurjaradesa, the second-largest kingdom of Western India, comprising southern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat in modern-day India. It was also a centre of learning for mathematics and astronomy. Brahmagupta became an astronomer of the Brahmapaksha school, one of the four major schools of Indian astronomy during this period. He studied the five traditional Siddhartha on Indian astronomy as well as the work of other astronomers including Aryabhata I, Latadeva, Pradyumna, Varahamihira, Simha, Srisena, Vijayanandin and Vishnuchandra. In the year 628, at the age of 30, he composed the 'BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnt' (the improved treatise of Brahma) which is believed to be a revised version of the received Siddhanta of the Brahmapaksha school. Scholars state that he incorporated a great deal of originality to his revision, adding a considerable amount of new material. The book consists of 24 chapters with 1008 verses in the ƒÅrya metre. A good deal of it is astronomy, but it also contains key chapters on mathematics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry and algorithmics, which are believed to contain new insights due to Brahmagupta himself. Later, Brahmagupta moved to Ujjaini, Avanti, which was also a major centre for astronomy in central India. At the age of 67, he composed his next well known work Khanda-khƒÅdyaka, a practical manual of Indian astronomy in the karana category meant to be used by students. Brahmagupta died in 668 CE, and he is presumed to have died in Ujjain. Controversy Brahmagupta directed a great deal of criticism towards the work of rival astronomers, and his Brahmasphutasiddhanta displays one of the earliest schisms among Indian mathematicians. The division was primarily about the application of mathematics to the physical world, rather than about the mathematics itself. In Brahmagupta's case, the disagreements stemmed largely from the choice of astronomical parameters and theories. Critiques of rival theories appear throughout the first ten astronomical chapters and the eleventh chapter is entirely devoted to criticism of these theories, although no criticisms appear in the twelfth and eighteenth chapters. Reception The historian of science George Sarton called him \\"one of the greatest scientists of his race and the greatest of his time.\\" Brahmagupta's mathematical advances were carried on further by BhƒÅskara II, a lineal descendant in Ujjain, who described Brahmagupta as the ganaka-chakra-chudamani (the gem of the circle of mathematicians). Prithudaka Svamin wrote commentaries on both of his works, rendering difficult verses into simpler language and adding illustrations. Lalla and Bhattotpala in the 8th and 9th centuries wrote commentaries on the Khanda-khadyaka. Further commentaries continued to be written into the 12th century. A few decades after the death of Brahmagupta, Sindh came under the Arab Caliphate in 712 CE. Expeditions were sent into Gurjaradesa (\\"Al-Baylaman in Jurz\\", as per Arab historians). The kingdom of Bhillamala seems to have been annihilated but Ujjain repulsed the attacks. The court of Caliph Al- Mansur (754‚Äì775) received an embassy from Sindh, including an astrologer called Kanaka, who brought (possibly memorised) astronomical texts, including those of Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta's texts were translated into Arabic by Muhammad al-Fazari, an astronomer in Al-Mansur's court under the names Sindhind and Arakhand. An immediate outcome was the spread of the decimal number system used in the texts. The mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (800‚Äì850 CE) wrote a text called al-Jam wal-tafriq bi hisal-al-Hind (Addition and Subtraction in Indian Arithmetic), which was translated into Latin in the 13th century as Algorithmi de numero indorum. Through these texts, the decimal number system and Brahmagupta's algorithms for arithmetic have spread throughout the world. Al-Khwarizmi also wrote his own version of Sindhind, drawing on Al-Fazari's version and incorporating Ptolemaic elements. Indian astronomic material circulated widely for centuries, even passing into medieval Latin texts. Mathematics =Algebra= Brahmagupta gave the solution of the general linear equation in chapter eighteen of BrahmasphutasiddhƒÅnta, > The difference between rupas, when inverted and divided by the difference of > the [coefficients] of the unknowns, is the unknown in the equation. The > rupas are [subtracted on the side] below that from which the square and the > unknown are to be subtracted. which is a solution for the equation where rupas refers to the constants and . The solution given is equivalent to . He further gave two equivalent solutions to the general quadratic equation > 18.44. Diminish by the middle [number] the square-root of the rupas > multiplied by four times the square and increased by the square of the > middle [number]; divide the remainder by twice the square. [The result is] > the middle [number]. > 18.45. Whatever is the square-root of the rupas multiplied by the square > [and] increased by the square of half the unknown, diminish that by half the > unknown [and] divide [the remainder] by its square. [The result is] the > unknown. which are, respectively, solutions for the equation equivalent to, :x = \\\\frac{\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{4ac+b^2}-b}{2a} and :x = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{ac+\\\\tfrac{b^2}{4}}-\\\\tfrac{b}{2}}{a}. He went on to solve systems of simultaneous indeterminate equations stating that the desired variable must first be isolated, and then the equation must be divided by the desired variable's coefficient. In particular, he recommended using \\"the pulverizer\\" to solve equations with multiple unknowns. > 18.51. Subtract the colors different from the first color. [The remainder] > divided by the first [color's coefficient] is the measure of the first. > [Terms] two by two [are] considered [when reduced to] similar divisors, [and > so on] repeatedly. If there are many [colors], the pulverizer [is to be > used]. Like the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms. \\"he was the first one to give a general solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave all integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India ‚Äì or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words.\\" The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known and it is possible that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source. =Arithmetic= The four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) were known to many cultures before Brahmagupta. This current system is based on the Hindu Arabic number system and first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. Brahmagupta describes the multiplication as thus \\"The multiplicand is repeated like a string for cattle, as often as there are integrant portions in the multiplier and is repeatedly multiplied by them and the products are added together. It is multiplication. Or the multiplicand is repeated as many times as there are component parts in the multiplier\\". Brahmasputha Siddhanta, Translated to English by H.T Colebrook, 1817 AD Indian arithmetic was known in Medieval Europe as \\"Modus Indorum\\" meaning method of the Indians. In Brahmasphutasiddhanta, multiplication was named Gomutrika. In the beginning of chapter twelve of his BrahmasphutasiddhƒÅnta, entitled Calculation, Brahmagupta details operations on fractions. The reader is expected to know the basic arithmetic operations as far as taking the square root, although he explains how to find the cube and cube-root of an integer and later gives rules facilitating the computation of squares and square roots. He then gives rules for dealing with five types of combinations of fractions: ; ; ; ; and . The reader is apparently expected to be familiar with basic arithmetic operations as far as the square-root; Brahmagupta merely notes some points about applying them to fractions. The procedures for finding the cube and cube-root of an integer, however, are described (compared the latter to Aryabhata's very similar formulation). They are followed by rules for five types of combinations: [...] Series Brahmagupta then goes on to give the sum of the squares and cubes of the first integers. > 12.20. The sum of the squares is that [sum] multiplied by twice the [number > of] step[s] increased by one [and] divided by three. The sum of the cubes is > the square of that [sum] Piles of these with identical balls [can also be > computed]. Here Brahmagupta found the result in terms of the sum of the first integers, rather than in terms of as is the modern practice. Here the sums of the squares and cubes of the first n integers are defined in terms of the sum of the n integers itself; He gives the sum of the squares of the first natural numbers as and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers as . Zero Brahmagupta's Brahmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta is the first book that provides rules for arithmetic manipulations that apply to zero and to negative numbers. The BrahmasphutasiddhƒÅnta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans. In chapter eighteen of his BrahmasphutasiddhƒÅnta, Brahmagupta describes operations on negative numbers. He first describes addition and subtraction, > 18.30. [The sum] of two positives is positives, of two negatives negative; > of a positive and a negative [the sum] is their difference; if they are > equal it is zero. The sum of a negative and zero is negative, [that] of a > positive and zero positive, [and that] of two zeros zero. > [...] > 18.32. A negative minus zero is negative, a positive [minus zero] positive; > zero [minus zero] is zero. When a positive is to be subtracted from a > negative or a negative from a positive, then it is to be added. He goes on to describe multiplication, > 18.33. The product of a negative and a positive is negative, of two > negatives positive, and of positives positive; the product of zero and a > negative, of zero and a positive, or of two zeros is zero. But his description of division by zero differs from our modern understanding: > 18.34. A positive divided by a positive or a negative divided by a negative > is positive; a zero divided by a zero is zero; a positive divided by a > negative is negative; a negative divided by a positive is [also] negative. > 18.35. A negative or a positive divided by zero has that [zero] as its > divisor, or zero divided by a negative or a positive [has that negative or > positive as its divisor]. The square of a negative or of a positive is > positive; [the square] of zero is zero. That of which [the square] is the > square is [its] square-root. Here Brahmagupta states that = 0 and as for the question of where ‚â† 0 he did not commit himself.: However, here again Brahmagupta spoiled matters somewhat by asserting that 0 √∑ 0 = 0, and on the touchy matter of a √∑ 0, he did not commit himself. His rules for arithmetic on negative numbers and zero are quite close to the modern understanding, except that in modern mathematics division by zero is left undefined. =Diophantine analysis= Pythagorean triplets In chapter twelve of his Brahmasphutasiddhanta, Brahmagupta provides a formula useful for generating Pythagorean triples: > 12.39. The height of a mountain multiplied by a given multiplier is the > distance to a city; it is not erased. When it is divided by the multiplier > increased by two it is the leap of one of the two who make the same journey. Or, in other words, if , then a traveller who \\"leaps\\" vertically upwards a distance from the top of a mountain of height , and then travels in a straight line to a city at a horizontal distance from the base of the mountain, travels the same distance as one who descends vertically down the mountain and then travels along the horizontal to the city. Stated geometrically, this says that if a right-angled triangle has a base of length and altitude of length , then the length, , of its hypotenuse is given by . And, indeed, elementary algebraic manipulation shows that whenever has the value stated. Also, if and are rational, so are , , and . A Pythagorean triple can therefore be obtained from , and by multiplying each of them by the least common multiple of their denominators. Pell's equation Brahmagupta went on to give a recurrence relation for generating solutions to certain instances of Diophantine equations of the second degree such as (called Pell's equation) by using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm was known to him as the \\"pulverizer\\" since it breaks numbers down into ever smaller pieces.: In the seventh century CE the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave a recurrence relation for generating solutions of x ‚àí Dy 1, as we shall see in Chapter 5. The Indians called the Euclidean algorithm the \\"pulverizer\\" because it breaks numbers down to smaller and smaller pieces. To obtain a recurrence one has to know that a rectangle proportional to the original eventually recurs, a fact that was rigorously proved only in 1768 by Lagrange. > The nature of squares: > 18.64. [Put down] twice the square-root of a given square by a multiplier > and increased or diminished by an arbitrary [number]. The product of the > first [pair], multiplied by the multiplier, with the product of the last > [pair], is the last computed. > 18.65. The sum of the thunderbolt products is the first. The additive is > equal to the product of the additives. The two square-roots, divided by the > additive or the subtractive, are the additive rupas. The key to his solution was the identity, :(x^2_1 - Ny^2_1)(x^2_2 - Ny^2_2) = (x_1 x_2 + Ny_1 y_2)^2 - N(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2 which is a generalisation of an identity that was discovered by Diophantus, :(x^2_1 - y^2_1)(x^2_2 - y^2_2) = (x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2)^2 - (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2. Using his identity and the fact that if and are solutions to the equations and , respectively, then is a solution to , he was able to find integral solutions to Pell's equation through a series of equations of the form . Brahmagupta was not able to apply his solution uniformly for all possible values of , rather he was only able to show that if has an integer solution for = ¬±1, ¬±2, or ¬±4, then has a solution. The solution of the general Pell's equation would have to wait for Bhaskara II in . =Geometry= Brahmagupta's formula Diagram for reference Brahmagupta's most famous result in geometry is his formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. Given the lengths of the sides of any cyclic quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave an approximate and an exact formula for the figure's area, > 12.21. The approximate area is the product of the halves of the sums of the > sides and opposite sides of a triangle and a quadrilateral. The accurate > [area] is the square root from the product of the halves of the sums of the > sides diminished by [each] side of the quadrilateral. So given the lengths , , and of a cyclic quadrilateral, the approximate area is while, letting , the exact area is : . Although Brahmagupta does not explicitly state that these quadrilaterals are cyclic, it is apparent from his rules that this is the case. Brahmagupta does not explicitly state that he is discussing only figures inscribed in circles, but it is implied by these rules for computing their circumradius. Heron's formula is a special case of this formula and it can be derived by setting one of the sides equal to zero. Triangles Brahmagupta dedicated a substantial portion of his work to geometry. One theorem gives the lengths of the two segments a triangle's base is divided into by its altitude: > 12.22. The base decreased and increased by the difference between the > squares of the sides divided by the base; when divided by two they are the > true segments. The perpendicular [altitude] is the square-root from the > square of a side diminished by the square of its segment. Thus the lengths of the two segments are . He further gives a theorem on rational triangles. A triangle with rational sides , , and rational area is of the form: :a = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u^2}{v}+v\\\\right), \\\\ \\\\ b = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u^2}{w}+w\\\\right), \\\\ \\\\ c = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u^2}{v} - v + \\\\frac{u^2}{w} - w\\\\right) for some rational numbers , , and . Brahmagupta's theorem Brahmagupta's theorem states that AF = FD. Brahmagupta continues, > 12.23. The square-root of the sum of the two products of the sides and > opposite sides of a non-unequal quadrilateral is the diagonal. The square of > the diagonal is diminished by the square of half the sum of the base and the > top; the square-root is the perpendicular [altitudes]. So, in a \\"non-unequal\\" cyclic quadrilateral (that is, an isosceles trapezoid), the length of each diagonal is . He continues to give formulas for the lengths and areas of geometric figures, such as the circumradius of an isosceles trapezoid and a scalene quadrilateral, and the lengths of diagonals in a scalene cyclic quadrilateral. This leads up to Brahmagupta's famous theorem, > 12.30‚Äì31. Imaging two triangles within [a cyclic quadrilateral] with unequal > sides, the two diagonals are the two bases. Their two segments are > separately the upper and lower segments [formed] at the intersection of the > diagonals. The two [lower segments] of the two diagonals are two sides in a > triangle; the base [of the quadrilateral is the base of the triangle]. Its > perpendicular is the lower portion of the [central] perpendicular; the upper > portion of the [central] perpendicular is half of the sum of the [sides] > perpendiculars diminished by the lower [portion of the central > perpendicular]. Pi In verse 40, he gives values of , > 12.40. The diameter and the square of the radius [each] multiplied by 3 are > [respectively] the practical circumference and the area [of a circle]. The > accurate [values] are the square-roots from the squares of those two > multiplied by ten. So Brahmagupta uses 3 as a \\"practical\\" value of , and \\\\sqrt{10} \\\\approx 3.1622\\\\ldots as an \\"accurate\\" value of . The error in this \\"accurate\\" value is less than 1%. Measurements and constructions In some of the verses before verse 40, Brahmagupta gives constructions of various figures with arbitrary sides. He essentially manipulated right triangles to produce isosceles triangles, scalene triangles, rectangles, isosceles trapezoids, isosceles trapezoids with three equal sides, and a scalene cyclic quadrilateral. After giving the value of pi, he deals with the geometry of plane figures and solids, such as finding volumes and surface areas (or empty spaces dug out of solids). He finds the volume of rectangular prisms, pyramids, and the frustum of a square pyramid. He further finds the average depth of a series of pits. For the volume of a frustum of a pyramid, he gives the \\"pragmatic\\" value as the depth times the square of the mean of the edges of the top and bottom faces, and he gives the \\"superficial\\" volume as the depth times their mean area. After the geometry of plane figures, Brahmagupta discusses the computation of volumes and surface areas of solids (or empty spaces dug out of solids). His straightforward rules for the volumes of a rectangular prism and pyramid are followed by a more ambiguous one, which may refer to finding the average depth of a sequence of puts with different depths. The next formula apparently deals with the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid, where the \\"pragmatic\\" volume is the depth times the square of the mean of the edges of the top and bottom faces, while the \\"superficial\\" volume is the depth times their mean area. =Trigonometry= Sine table In Chapter 2 of his Brahmasphutasiddhanta, entitled Planetary True Longitudes, Brahmagupta presents a sine table: > 2.2‚Äì5. The sines: The Progenitors, twins; Ursa Major, twins, the Vedas; the > gods, fires, six; flavors, dice, the gods; the moon, five, the sky, the > moon; the moon, arrows, suns [...] Here Brahmagupta uses names of objects to represent the digits of place-value numerals, as was common with numerical data in Sanskrit treatises. Progenitors represents the 14 Progenitors (\\"Manu\\") in Indian cosmology or 14, \\"twins\\" means 2, \\"Ursa Major\\" represents the seven stars of Ursa Major or 7, \\"Vedas\\" refers to the 4 Vedas or 4, dice represents the number of sides of the tradition die or 6, and so on. This information can be translated into the list of sines, 214, 427, 638, 846, 1051, 1251, 1446, 1635, 1817, 1991, 2156, 2312, 1459, 2594, 2719, 2832, 2933, 3021, 3096, 3159, 3207, 3242, 3263, and 3270, with the radius being 3270. Brahmagupta's sine table, like much other numerical data in Sanskrit treatises, is encoded mostly in concrete-number notation that uses names of objects to represent the digits of place-value numerals, starting with the least significant. [...] There are fourteen Progenitors (\\"Manu\\") in Indian cosmology; \\"twins\\" of course stands for 2; the seven stars of Ursa Major (the \\"Sages\\") for 7, the four Vedas, and the four sides of the traditional dice used in gambling, for 6, and so on. Thus Brahmagupta enumerates his first six sine-values as 214, 427, 638, 846, 1051, 1251. (His remaining eighteen sines are 1446, 1635, 1817, 1991, 2156, 2312, 1459, 2594, 2719, 2832, 2933, 3021, 3096, 3159, 3207, 3242, 3263, 3270). The Paitamahasiddhanta, however, specifies an initial sine-value of 225 (although the rest of its sine-table is lost), implying a trigonometric radius of R = 3438 approx= C(')/2œÄ: a tradition followed, as we have seen, by Aryabhata. Nobody knows why Brahmagupta chose instead to normalize these values to R = 3270. Interpolation formula In 665 Brahmagupta devised and used a special case of the Newton‚ÄìStirling interpolation formula of the second-order to interpolate new values of the sine function from other values already tabulated.Joseph (2000, pp.285‚Äì86). The formula gives an estimate for the value of a function at a value of its argument (with and ) when its value is already known at , and . The formula for the estimate is: : f( a + x h ) \\\\approx f(a) + x \\\\frac{\\\\Delta f(a) + \\\\Delta f(a-h)}{2} + x^2 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta^2 f(a-h)}{2!}. where is the first-order forward-difference operator, i.e. : \\\\Delta f(a) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ f(a+h) - f(a). Astronomy Some of the important contributions made by Brahmagupta in astronomy are his methods for calculating the position of heavenly bodies over time (ephemerides), their rising and setting, conjunctions, and the calculation of solar and lunar eclipses. In chapter seven of his Brahmasphutasiddhanta, entitled Lunar Crescent, Brahmagupta rebuts the idea that the Moon is farther from the Earth than the Sun. He does this by explaining the illumination of the Moon by the Sun. > 1\\\\. If the moon were above the sun, how would the power of waxing and > waning, etc., be produced from calculation of the longitude of the moon? The > near half would always be bright. > 2\\\\. In the same way that the half seen by the sun of a pot standing in > sunlight is bright, and the unseen half dark, so is [the illumination] of > the moon [if it is] beneath the sun. > 3\\\\. The brightness is increased in the direction of the sun. At the end of > a bright [i.e. waxing] half-month, the near half is bright and the far half > dark. Hence, the elevation of the horns [of the crescent can be derived] > from calculation. [...] He explains that since the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun, the degree of the illuminated part of the Moon depends on the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon, and this can be computed from the size of the angle between the two bodies. Brahmagupta discusses the illumination of the moon by the sun, rebutting an idea maintained in scriptures: namely, that the moon is farther from the earth than the sun is. In fact, as he explains, because the moon is closer the extent of the illuminated portion of the moon depends on the relative positions of the moon and the sun, and can be computed from the size of the angular separation Œ± between them. Further work exploring the longitudes of the planets, diurnal rotation, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the moon's crescent and conjunctions of the planets, are discussed in his treatise Khandakhadyaka.

C. Raychaudhuri (1972), Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp. 8-10, 21‚Äì25 and the 7th century BCE. Yajnavalkya is considered one of the earliest philosophers in recorded history. Yajnavalkya proposes and debates metaphysical questions about the nature of existence, consciousness and impermanence, and expounds the epistemic doctrine of neti neti (\\"not this, not this\\") to discover the universal Self and ƒÄtman. His ideas for renunciation of worldly attachments have been important to Hindu sannyasa traditions. Yajnavalkya is credited for coining the Advaita (non- dualism, monism), another important tradition within Hinduism. Texts attributed to him, include the Yajnavalkya Smriti, Yoga Yajnavalkya and some texts of the Vedanta school. He is also mentioned in various Brahmanas and Aranyakas. He welcomed participation of women in Vedic studies, and Hindu texts contain his dialogues with two women philosophers, Gargi Vachaknavi and Maitreyi. History Yanjavalkya is estimated to have lived in around the 8th century BCE, or 7th century BCE. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, a set of dialogues suggest Yajnavalkya has two wives, one Maitreyi who challenges Yajnavalkya with philosophical questions like a scholarly wife; the other Katyayani who is silent but mentioned as a housewife. While Yajnavalkya and Katyayani lived in contented domesticity, Maitreyi studied metaphysics and engaged in theological dialogues with her husband in addition to \\"making self- inquiries of introspection\\".John Muir, , page 246‚Äì251 In contrast to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the epic Mahabharata states Maitreyi is a young beauty who is an Advaita scholar but never marries.John Muir, , page 251‚Äì253 His name Yajnavalkya is derived from yajna which connotes ritual. However, states Frits Staal, Yajnavalkya was \\"a thinker, not a ritualist\\". Texts Goddess Sarasvati and Yajnavalkya (early 20th-century devotional illustration) Yajnavalkya is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya.I Fisher (1984), Yajnavalkya in the Sruti traditions of the Veda, Acta Orientalia, Volume 45, pages 55‚Äì87 He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas,Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik, , pages lvi, xlviii‚Äìlix as well as in ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim.Hajime Nakamura (1968), Yajnavalkya and other Upanishadic thinkers in a Jain tradition, The Adyar Library Bulletin, Volume 31‚Äì32, pages 214‚Äì228 Another important and influential Yoga text in Hinduism is named after him, namely Yoga Yajnavalkya, but its author is unclear. The actual author of Yoga Yajnavalkya text was probably someone who lived many centuries after the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya, and is unknowIng Yajnavalkya was father, Vajasaneya was his biological son, who wrote or explained Yoga Yajnavalkya in writings to his descendants! Ian Whicher, a professor of Religion at the University of Manitoba, states that the author of Yoga Yajnavalkya may be an ancient Yajnavalkya, but this Yajnavalkya is not to be confused with the Vedic-era Yajnavalkya \\"who is revered in Hinduism for Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\\".Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, , pages 27, 315‚Äì316 with notes According to Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik, these references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya, may be to different sages with the same name. Ideas =On karma and rebirth= One of the early expositions of karma and rebirth theories appear in the discussions of Yajnavalkya. Max Muller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of \\"Soul, Self\\" and \\"free, liberated state of existence\\" as, \\"[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman- Br√¢hmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yajnavalkya.\\"Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 475-507Max Muller, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.3-4, Oxford University Press, pages 161-181 with footnotes =On spiritual liberation= The section 4.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is attributed to Yajnavalkya, and it discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom), and provides some of its most studied hymns. Paul Deussen calls it, \\"unique in its richness and warmth of presentation\\", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 482 =On love and soul= The Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states that love is driven by a person's soul, and it discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity, the core of Advaita philosophy. The Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the Madhyamdina and Kanva Vedic schools; although they have significant literary differences, they share the same philosophical theme. This dialogue appears in several Hindu texts; the earliest is in chapter 2.4 ‚Äì and modified in chapter 4.5 ‚Äì of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the principal and oldest Upanishads. Adi Shankara, a scholar of the influential Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, wrote in his Brihadaranyakopanishad bhashya that the purpose of the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue in chapter 2.4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is to highlight the importance of the knowledge of Atman and Brahman, and to understand their oneness. According to Shankara, the dialogue suggests renunciation is prescribed in the Sruti (vedic texts of Hinduism), as a means to knowledge of the Brahman and Atman. He adds, that the pursuit of self-knowledge is considered important in the Sruti because the Maitreyi dialogue is repeated in chapter 4.5 as a \\"logical finale\\" to the discussion of Brahman in the Upanishad. Concluding his dialogue on the \\"inner self\\", or soul, Yajnavalkaya tells Maitreyi: After Yajnavalkya leaves and becomes a sannyasi, Maitreyi becomes a sannyasini ‚Äì she too wanders and leads a renunciate's life.

Oblique incoming wind squeezes water along the coast, and so generates a water current which moves parallel to the coast. Longshore drift is simply the sediment moved by the longshore current. This current and sediment movement occur within the surf zone. Beach sand is also moved on such oblique wind days, due to the swash and backwash of water on the beach. Breaking surf sends water up the beach (swash) at an oblique angle and gravity then drains the water straight downslope (backwash) perpendicular to the shoreline. Thus beach sand can move downbeach in a sawtooth fashion many tens of meters (yards) per day. This process is called \\"beach drift\\" but some workers regard it as simply part of \\"longshore drift\\" because of the overall movement of sand parallel to the coast. Longshore drift affects numerous sediment sizes as it works in slightly different ways depending on the sediment (e.g. the difference in long-shore drift of sediments from a sandy beach to that of sediments from a shingle beach). Sand is largely affected by the oscillatory force of breaking waves, the motion of sediment due to the impact of breaking waves and bed shear from long-shore current.Reeve et al., 2004 Because shingle beaches are much steeper than sandy ones, plunging breakers are more likely to form, causing the majority of long shore transport to occur in the swash zone, due to a lack of an extended surf zone. Overview =Longshore drift formulas= There are numerous calculations that take into consideration the factors that produce longshore drift. These formulations are: #Bijker formula (1967, 1971) #The Engelund and Hansen formula (1967) #The Ackers and White formula (1973) #The Bailard and Inman formula (1981) #The Van Rijn formula (1984) #The Watanabe formula (1992) These formulas all provide a different view into the processes that generate longshore drift. The most common factors taken into consideration in these formulas are: *Suspended and bed load transport *Waves e.g. breaking and non- breaking *The shear exerted by waves or the flow associated with waves. =Features of shoreline change= Longshore drift plays a large role in the evolution of a shoreline, as if there is a slight change of sediment supply, wind direction, or any other coastal influence longshore drift can change dramatically, affecting the formation and evolution of a beach system or profile. These changes do not occur due to one factor within the coastal system, in fact there are numerous alterations that can occur within the coastal system that may affect the distribution and impact of longshore drift. Some of these are: # Geological changes, e.g. erosion, backshore changes and emergence of headlands. # Change in hydrodynamic forces, e.g. change in wave diffraction in headland and offshore bank environments. # Change to hydrodynamic influences, e.g. the influence of new tidal inlets and deltas on drift. # Alterations of the sediment budget, e.g. switch of shorelines from drift to swash alignment, exhaustion of sediment sources. # The intervention of humans, e.g. cliff protection, groynes, detached breakwaters. =The sediment budget= The sediment budget takes into consideration sediment sources and sinks within a system.Brunn, 2005 This sediment can come from any source with examples of sources and sinks consisting of: * Rivers * Lagoons * Eroding land sources * Artificial sources e.g. nourishment * Artificial sinks e.g. mining/extraction * Offshore transport * Deposition of sediment on shore * Gullies through the land This sediment then enters the coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A good example of the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long-shore transport.Brunn, 2005, Michel and Howa, 1997 As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal (shoal) systems provide a good sources and sinks for the sediment budget. Sediment deposition throughout a shoreline profile conforms to the null point hypothesis; where gravitational and hydraulic forces determine the settling velocity of grains in a seaward fining sediment distribution. Long shore occurs in a 90 to 80 degree backwash so it would be presented as a right angle with the wave line. Natural features This section consists of features of longshore drift that occur on a coast where long-shore drift occurs uninterrupted by man-made structures. =Spits= Provincetown Spit, at the northern end of Cape Cod, was formed by longshore drift after the end of the last Ice age. Spits are formed when longshore drift travels past a point (e.g. river mouth or re-entrant) where the dominant drift direction and shoreline do not veer in the same direction.Hart et al., 2008 As well as dominant drift direction, spits are affected by the strength of wave driven current, wave angle and the height of incoming waves.IPetersen et al., 2008 Spits are landforms that have two important features, with the first feature being the region at the up-drift end or proximal end (Hart et al., 2008). The proximal end is constantly attached to land (unless breached) and may form a slight ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù between the sea and an estuary or lagoon.Hart et al., 2008, Petersen et al., 2008 The second important spit feature is the down-drift end or distal end, which is detached from land and in some cases, may take a complex hook-shape or curve, due to the influence of varying wave directions. As an example, the New Brighton spit in Canterbury, New Zealand, was created by longshore drift of sediment from the Waimakariri River to the north. This spit system is currently in equilibrium but undergoes alternate phases of deposition and erosion. =Barriers= Barrier systems are attached to the land at both the proximal and distal end and are generally widest at the down-drift end.Kirk and Lauder, 2000 These barrier systems may enclose an estuary or lagoon system, like that of Lake Ellesmere enclosed by the Kaitorete Spit or hapua which form at river-coast interface such as at the mouth of the Rakaia River. The Kaitorete Spit in Canterbury, New Zealand, is a barrier/spit system (which generally falls under the definition barrier, as both ends of the landform are attached to land, but has been named a spit) that has existed below Banks Peninsula for the last 8,000 years.Soons et al., 1997 This system has undergone numerous changes and fluctuations due to avulsion of the Waimakariri River (which now flows to the north or Banks Peninsula), erosion and phases of open marine conditions. The system underwent further changes c.500 year BP, when longshore drift from the eastern end of the ‚Äúspit‚Äù system created the barrier, which has been retained due to ongoing longshore transport. =Tidal inlets= The majority of tidal inlets on longshore drift shores accumulate sediment in flood and ebb shoals. Ebb-deltas may become stunted on highly exposed shores and in smaller spaces, whereas flood deltas are likely to increase in size when space is available in a bay or lagoon system. Tidal inlets can act as sinks and sources for large amounts of material, which therefore impacts on adjacent parts of the coastline.Michel and Howa, 1997 The structuring of tidal inlets is also important for longshore drift as if an inlet is unstructured sediment may by pass the inlet and form bars at the down-drift part of the coast. Although this may also depend on the inlet size, delta morphology, sediment rate and by passing mechanism. Channel location variance and amount may also influence the impact of long shore drift on a tidal inlet as well. For example, the Arcachon lagoon is a tidal inlet system in South west France, which provides large sources and sinks for longshore drift sediments. The impact of longshore drift sediments on this inlet system is highly influenced by the variation in the number of lagoon entrances and the location of these entrances. Any change in these factors can cause severe down-drift erosion or down-drift accretion of large swash bars. Human influences This section consists of long-shore drift features that occur unnaturally and in some cases (e.g. groynes, detached breakwaters) have been constructed to enhance the effects of longshore drift on the coastline but in other cases have a negative impact on long-shore drift (ports and harbours). =Groynes= Timber groyne from Swanage Bay, UK Groynes are shore protection structures, placed at equal intervals along the coastline in order to stop coastal erosion and generally cross the intertidal zone. Due to this, groyne structures are usually used on shores with low net and high annual longshore drift in order to retain the sediments lost in storm surges and further down the coast. There are numerous variations to groyne designs with the three most common designs consisting of: # zig-zag groynes, which dissipate the destructive flows that form in wave induced currents or in breaking waves. # T-head groynes, which reduce wave height through wave diffraction. # ‚ÄòY‚Äô head, a fish-tail groyne system. =Artificial headlands= Artificial headlands are also shore protection structures, which are created in order to provide a certain amount of protection to beaches or bays. Although the creation of headlands involves accretion of sediments on the up- drift side of the headland and moderate erosion of the down-drift end of the headland, this is undertaken in order to design a stabilised system that allows material to accumulate in beaches further along the shore. Artificial headlands can occur due to natural accumulation or also through artificial nourishment. breakwaters in a coastal system =Detached breakwaters= Detached breakwaters are shore protection structures, created to build up sandy material in order to accommodate drawdown in storm conditions. In order to accommodate drawdown in storm conditions detached breakwaters have no connection to the shoreline, which lets currents and sediment pass between the breakwater and the shore. This then forms a region of reduced wave energy, which encourages the deposition of sand on the lee side of the structure. Detached breakwaters are generally used in the same way as groynes, to build up the volume of material between the coast and the breakwater structure in order to accommodate storm surges. =Ports and harbours= The creation of ports and harbours throughout the world can seriously impact on the natural course of longshore drift. Not only do ports and harbours pose a threat to longshore drift in the short term, they also pose a threat to shoreline evolution. The major influence, which the creation of a port or harbour can have on longshore drift, is the alteration of sedimentation patterns, which in turn may lead to accretion and/or erosion of a beach or coastal system. As an example, the creation of a port in Timaru, New Zealand in the late 19th century led to a significant change in the longshore drift along the South Canterbury coastline. Instead of longshore drift transporting sediment north up the coast towards the Waimataitai lagoon, the creation of the port blocked the drift of these (coarse) sediments and instead caused them to accrete to the south of the port at South beach in Timaru. The accretion of this sediment to the south, therefore meant a lack of sediment being deposited on the coast near the Waimataitai lagoon (to the north of the port), which led to the loss of the barrier enclosing the lagoon in the 1930s and then shortly after, the loss of the lagoon itself. As with the Waimataitai lagoon, the Washdyke Lagoon, which currently lies to the north of the Timaru port, is undergoing erosion and may eventually breach, causing loss of another lagoon environment.

Early life Anthony Wood was born in Oxford on 17 December 1632, as the fourth son of Thomas Wood (1581‚Äì1643), BCL of Oxford, and his second wife, Mary (1602‚Äì1667), daughter of Robert Pettie and Penelope Taverner. Wood was sent to New College School in 1641, and at the age of twelve was removed to the free Lord Williams's School at Thame, where his studies were interrupted by Civil War skirmishes. He was then placed under the tuition of his brother Edward (1627‚Äì1655), of Trinity College, and, as he tells us, \\"while he continued in this condition his mother would alwaies be soliciting him to be an apprentice which he could never endure to heare of\\". He was entered at Merton College in 1647, and made postmaster, a type of scholar at Merton.Blue plaque to Wood on Postmasters' Hall, Merton Street, Oxford In 1652 Wood amused himself with ploughing and bell-ringing. \\"Having had from his most tender years an extraordinary ravishing delight in music\\", he began to teach himself the violin and took his BA examinations. He engaged a music-master and obtained permission to use the Bodleian, \\"which he took to be the happiness of his life\\". He received the MA degree in 1655, and in the following year published a volume of sermons by his late brother Edward. Career as an antiquary Wood began, systematically, to copy monumental inscriptions and to search for antiquities in the city and neighbourhood. He went through the Christ Church registers, \\"at this time being resolved to set himself to the study of antiquities.\\" Dr John Wallis, the keeper, allowed him free access to the university registers in 1660; \\"here he layd the foundation of that book which was fourteen years afterwards published, viz. Hist. et Antiq. Univ. Oxon\\". He also came to know the Oxford collections of Brian Twyne to which he was greatly indebted, and those of the assiduous antiquary Ralph Sheldon.University of Toronto Libraries, British Armorial Bindings Retrieved 16 December 2015 He steadily investigated the muniments of all the colleges, and in 1667 made his first journey to London, where he visited William Dugdale, who introduced him into the Cottonian Library, and William Prynne showed him the same civility for the Tower records. On 22 October 1669, he was sent for by the delegates of the press, \\"that whereas he had taken a great deal of paines in writing the Hist. and Antiq. of the Universitie of Oxon, they would for his paines give him an 100 li. for his copie, conditionally, that he would suffer the book to be translated into Latine\\". He accepted the offer and set to work to prepare his English manuscript for the translators, Richard Peers and Richard Reeve, both appointed by Dr Fell, Dean of Christ Church, who undertook the expense of printing. In 1674 appeared Historia, et antiquitates Universitatis Oxoniensis, handsomely reprinted \\"e Theatro Sheldoniano\\" in two folio volumes, the first devoted to the university in general and the second to the colleges. Copies were widely distributed, and university and author received much praise; in the following year the magnificent series of illustrations linked to the history were separately published as David Loggan's Oxonia Illustrata, which contained instructions on where to insert the plates in Wood's history; copies of the history 'with the cuts' became a special gift object for noble visitors to the University. Wood was disappointed with the Latin translation, and Bishop Barlow told a correspondent that \\"not only the Latine but the history itself is in many things ridiculously false\\". cites Genuine Remains, 1693, p. 183. Despite the carping, Wood's meticulously researched text, with extensive footnotes to original sources, remains a worthy successor to Dugdale's work which had been his inspiration. In 1678 the university registers which had been in Wood's custody for eighteen years were removed, as it was feared that he would be implicated in the Popish Plot. To relieve himself from suspicion he took the Oath of Supremacy. During this time he had been gradually completing his great work, which was produced by a London publisher in 1691‚Äì1692, 2 vols. folio, Athenae Oxonienses: an Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690, to which are added the Fasti, or Annals for the said time. Wood contemplated publishing a third volume of the Athenae, printed in the Netherlands. The third appeared subsequently as \\"a new edition, with additions, and a continuation by Philip Bliss\\" (1813‚Äì1820, 4 vols. 4to). The Ecclesiastical History Society proposed to bring out a fourth edition, which stopped at the Life, ed. by Bliss (1848, 8vo; see Cent. Mag., N.S., xxix. 135, 268). Bliss's interleaved copy is in the Bodleian. On 29 July 1693 Wood was condemned and fined in the vice- chancellor's court for certain libels against the late Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. He was punished by being banished from the university until he recanted, the offending pages being burnt. The proceedings were printed in a volume of Miscellanies, published by Edmund Curll in 1714. Wood was attacked by Bishop Burnet in A letter to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (1693), and defended by his nephew Dr Thomas Wood, in a Vindication of the Historiographer, to which is added the Historiographer's Answer (1693), reproduced in the subsequent editions of the Athenae. The nephew also defended his uncle in An Appendix to the Life of Bishop Seth Ward, 1697. After a short illness Anthony Wood died, and was buried in the outer chapel of St John Baptist (Merton College), in Oxford, where he had superintended the digging of his own grave only a few days before. He was described as \\"a very strong lusty man,\\" of uncouth manners and appearance, not so deaf as he pretended, of reserved and temperate habits, not avaricious and a despiser of honours. He received neither office nor reward from the university which owed so much to his labours. He never married, and led a life of self-denial, entirely devoted to antiquarian research. Bell-ringing and music were his chief relaxations. His literary style is poor, and his taste and judgment are frequently warped by prejudice, but his two great works and unpublished collections form a priceless source of information on Oxford and her worthies. He was always suspected of being a Roman Catholic, and invariably treated Jacobites and Papists better than Dissenters in the Athenae, but he died in communion with the Church of England. Legacy Wood's original manuscript (purchased by the Bodleian in 1846) was first published by John Gutch as The History and Antiquities of the Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford, with a continuation (1786‚Äì1790, 2 vols. 4to), and The History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford (1792‚Äì1796, 3 vols. 410), with a portrait of Wood. To these can be added The Antient and Present State of the City of Oxford, chiefly collected by A. √† Wood, with additions by the Rev. Sir J. Peshall (1773, 4to; the text is garbled and the editing very imperfect). The Survey of the Antiquities of the City of Oxford, composed in 1661‚Äì66 by Anthony Wood, edited by Andrew Clark, was issued by the Oxford Historical Society (1889‚Äì1899, 3 vols. 8vo). Modius Salium, a Collection of Pieces of Humour was published at Oxford in 1751, 12mo. Some letters between John Aubrey and Wood were published in the Gentleman's Magazine (3rd ser., ix. x. xi.). Wood bequeathed his library (127 manuscripts and 970 printed books) to the Ashmolean Museum, and the keeper, William Huddesford, printed a catalogue of the manuscripts in 1761. In 1858 the whole collection was transferred to the Bodleian, where 25 volumes of Wood's manuscripts had been since 1690. Many of the original papers from which the Athenae was written, as well as several large volumes of Wood's correspondence and all his diaries, are preserved in the Bodleian. In fiction A fictionalised version of Anthony Wood is one of four narrators in Iain Pears' 1998 novel An Instance of the Fingerpost, which is set in the early 1660s.

His name has become synonymous, through the attacks on him by Alexander Pope, with unscrupulous publication and publicity. Curll rose from poverty to wealth through his publishing, and he did this by approaching book printing in a mercenary and unscrupulous manner. By cashing in on scandals, publishing pornography, offering up patent medicine, using all publicity as good publicity, he managed a small empire of printing houses. He would publish high and low quality writing alike, so long as it sold. He was born in the West Country, and his late and incomplete recollections (in The Curliad) say that his father was a tradesman. He was an apprentice to a London bookseller in 1698 when he began his career. Early hucksterism An auctioneer selling books from a hanged man, circa 1700. Curll got his start doing this kind of work in 1708. At the end of his seven-year apprenticeship, he began selling books at auction. His master, Richard Smith, went bankrupt in 1708, and Curll took over his shop at that point. His early practice was to work in conjunction with other booksellers to write, publish, and sell pamphlets and books and to exploit any furore to produce \\"accounts\\" and arguments. For example, in 1712 the witch trial of Jane Wenham had the public's interest, and one partner wrote a pamphlet exonerating her, while another condemned her, and both pamphlets were sold at all three shops. He also manufactured a set group of newspaper quarrels between the various \\"authors\\" for and against Mrs. Wenham to get free advertising. As a bookseller, Curll's stock was always exceptionally eclectic, and as a publisher, he produced inexpensive books on inexpensive paper. Most of his books sold for one or two shillings, putting them within reach of tradesmen, apprentices, and servants. He carried and published erotic literaturePatrick J Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 50 and mixed it with serious Christian calls to prayer, \\"medical\\" texts, and the like. He also published Whig political tracts. One of his earliest productions was John Dunton's The Athenian Spy, but he also had titles like The Way of a Man with a Maid and The Devout Christian's Companion. Curll also sold medical cures themselves, and he was unscrupulous in promoting them. In 1708, he published The Charitable Surgeon, a feigned book of medical advice on syphilis cures from a pretended physician of public spirit. It explained that one John Spinke's cure of mercury was devoid of worth and that the only efficacious cure came from Edmund Curll's own shop. Dr. Spinke wrote a pamphlet in reply, and characteristically Curll wrote a reply to that and, to create a scandal, made the outlandish claim that Spinke was ignorant and offered five pounds if Spinke could come to Curll's shop and translate five lines of Latin. Spinke did so and used the money to buy some of Curll's \\"cure\\", which he had analyzed. In the end, Curll's \\"cure\\" was also mercury. Curll kept publishing his Charitable Surgeon, however, and expanded it with A new method of curing, without internal medicines, that degree of the venereal disease, called a gonorrhea, or clap. In 1712, Curll's shop was so successful that he opened a branch in Tunbridge Wells, and he moved to a bigger store on Fleet Street. He began to write his own pamphlets around this time. In 1712 he collaborated with John Morphew, a Tory, to cash in on the excitement over the Henry Sacheverell controversy. After their collaboration, Curll was able to hire away one of Morphew's hack writers. Piracy One feature of Curll's career, and the one that most cemented his reputation through the ages, was the unauthorized publication of works originally produced by another house, often against the author's wishes. Usually, Curll stayed just across the legal line from piracy, but not always. In 1707, Curll announced in the newspapers that he was going to publish Poems on Several Occasions by Matthew Prior. Jacob Tonson had the sole rights to Prior's works, but Curll published anyway. In 1716, Curll again announced his intent to publish Matthew Prior's works, and Prior himself wrote letters of protest to the newspapers. The quarrel with Tonson, and Prior's objections, only served as publicity, however, and Curll published the book anyway. In 1710, he printed up Jonathan Swift's Meditation Upon a Broomstick. He also that year wrote a \\"key\\" to other Swift works, and in 1713 he produced a key to A Tale of a Tub. Swift was angry at Curll for revealing his authorship of the works (as Swift was ascending in the Church of England), but he was also amused at the dullness of Curll's explication of his works. He wrote to Alexander Pope that dunces like Curll were tools for a satirist, that they were valuable in their way. Having gotten into the habit of sapping Swift, Curll did not relent, especially after Swift incorporated Curll's notes (without permission) into the apparatus of A Tale of a Tub. In 1726, Curll produced a wildly inaccurate \\"key\\" to Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Another alleged case of unauthorized publication came with the poet Edward Young, who sent a poem to Curll for publication, with a letter of solicitation. When the poem was published in 1717, Young took out an ad claiming that the poem and letter were forgeries. In fact, the poem was in praise of a politician who had lost place, and Young's letter was authentic. His connection with the anonymously-published Court Poems in 1716 led to the long quarrel with Alexander Pope. Curll got three anonymous poems, by Pope, John Gay, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Pope wrote to Curll warning him not to publish the poems, which only confirmed for Curll the authorship. He published them. In response, Pope and Bernard Lintot, Pope's publisher, met with Curll at the Swan tavern. Pope and Lintot seemed resigned and worried only for John Gay's prospects. However, they had filled Curll's glass with an emetic, causing him, when he went home, to go into convulsions of vomiting. Pope published two pamphlet accounts of the incident and informed the public (a la Swift's Bickerstaff Papers) that Curll was dead. Curll seized upon the publicity for his own purposes, as well. He published and advertised John Oldmixon's The Catholick Poet and John Dennis's The True Character of Mr Pope and his Writings. He reprinted these in 1716, when the atmosphere of England was highly charged after the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1715. The next step in the Pope/Curll battle came in 1716, when Curll got a bawdy version of the first Psalm written years earlier by Pope. He published it in folio and announced that he would be the future publisher of all of Pope's works. Also in that year, Curll was sent to jail for publishing an account of the trial of the Earl of Winton. No sooner was he out than he produced a biography of Dr. Robert South, former head of Westminster School. He had printed the eulogy for Dr. South by the current school head, as well. He was invited to the school and expected to be honored for the work he had done on behalf of the memory of the school's masters. Instead, the students forced him to his knees by beatings and forced him to beg for an apology. They then wrapped him in a blanket and began beating him with sticks and tossing him in the air. Samuel Wesley, a student at the school and older brother to John Wesley, wrote a mock-heroic poem on the blanket incident. Curll suspected that Pope and his friends were somehow responsible for his treatment, and he began to employ the \\"phantom poet.\\" He published a poem called \\"The Petticoat\\" by \\"J. Gay.\\" This poet was Francis Chute, who used the pseudonym \\"Joseph Gay.\\" To siphon off sales of John Gay's poems and to wound Pope and his friends, Curll used this phantom twice more. Biographies, obscenity and \\"Curlicisms\\" He was notorious for commissioning hack-written biographies of famous people as soon as they died and for publishing them without regard for inaccuracies and inventions. Perhaps the reference to Curll most often repeated by posterity is John Arbuthnot's quip that Curll's biographies had become \\"one of the new terrors of death\\" (quoted in Robert Carruthers, The Poetical Works of Pope, 1853, vol. 1, ch. 3). Curll's entire goal was to be the first to the shops with a biography and not in any way to be the best or most accurate account. Thus, his method was to announce that a biography was about to be published and ask the public to contribute any memories, letters, or speeches of the deceased. He would then include these (and sometimes nothing else) in the \\"biography.\\" He had no care at all for accuracy and would accept accounts from enemies as quickly as friends. When contributions failed, he would hire an author to invent material. In 1717 alone, he produced biographies of Bishop Burnet and Elias Ashmole. He would later produce, exactly as Swift predicted in his 1731 Lines on the Death of Dr. Swift, a hack biography of Swift. Arbuthnot's terror was apt, for there was virtually no recourse against Curll's press. In 1721, he published a biography of the Duke of Buckingham. He was summoned to the House of Lords for trial, and Lords made a new law making it illegal to publish anything about or by a lord without permission. Curll became notorious for his indecent publications, so much so that \\"Curlicism\\" was regarded as a synonym for literary indecency. In 1718, Curll published Eunuchism Display'd, and Daniel Defoe attacked it as pornography, calling it a \\"Curlicism.\\" Curll capitalized on the charge by writing Curlicism Display'd as a defense. The pamphlet was, however, a listing of books in Curll's shop, so Curll turned the entire thing into an advertisement. In 1723, he published A Treatise of the Use of Flogging in Venereal Affairs, which was a translation of De Usu Flagrorum. To the book, Curll added a sexual frontispiece and advertised other \\"medical\\" books. In 1724, he published Venus in the Cloister, a translation of a mildly erotic French title of the previous century that argued that it is the church, and not Christ, that forbids sexual exploration.Patrick J Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 49‚Äì50 That year, an anonymous complaint to the Lords mentioned these two titles specifically as obscenities. As with previous scandals, Curll attempted to turn it to profit by publishing The Humble Representation of Edmund Curll and rushing forward a new edition of Venus in the Cloister. He was arrested in March and held until July. The courts determined that there was no actual obscenity law, so they prosecuted him for libel. Curll published an apology and promised to quit publishing, but the apology was an ad for two new titles. While Curll was in prison, he met John Ker, who wished his memoirs published. The work contained state secrets from the reign of Queen Anne, so Curll was nervous. He wrote to Robert Walpole for permission. Getting no answer, he treated silence as assent and published the book. The last volume of the memoirs was done by Edmund's son, Henry Curll, and both Henry and Edmund were arrested. They spent fourteen months in prison (to February 1728) and were fined for the Nun in her Smock and The use of flogging, and sentenced to an hour in the pillory for publishing Ker's memoirs. Curll wrote and published a broadsheet for his pillory day saying that publishing Ker's memoirs had been done out of loyalty to the old queen only, and the crowd therefore did not beat him. Instead, they cheered Curll and carried him away on their shoulders. Curll and The Dunciad Pope and Curll tangled again in 1726, when he published some of Pope's letters without authorization. Pope avenged himself by having Curll figure very prominently in the 1728 Dunciad. In fact, no figure, including the \\"King of Dunces\\" Lewis Theobald (nor, later, Colley Cibber) is ridiculed as consistently and viciously in Dunciad as Edmund Curll. Curll's response was to print a pirate edition, then to produce a \\"Key\\" to the poem to explain all the people Pope attacked, and then to publish reply poems that were attacks on Pope personally. The Popiad, written possibly by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, The Female Dunciad, and The Twickenham Hotch-Potch all came out in 1728 as answers. In 1729, Pope's Dunciad Variorum took further, prose swipes at Curll, and Curll produced The Curliad: a Hypercritic upon the Dunciad Variorum. It contained an autobiography, a defense against charges of obscenity (explaining that the flogging text had been meant as a cure for impotence), and a defense of his actions with Pope. Later in 1729, Curll set out to publish a volume of William Congreve. John Arbuthnot complained in the press of Curll's action, so Curll renamed his shop \\"Congreve's Head\\" and put up a bust of Congreve to spite Arbuthnot and Congreve's friends. In 1731 he moved shops to Burleigh Street and advertised an upcoming life of Pope, saying, \\"Nothing shall be wanting but his (universally desired) Death.\\" In response to his call for materials, a person known as \\"P.T.\\" offered Curll some Pope letters. The letters, however, were fakes, and the entire offer had been a set-up by Pope, who published a corrected version of his letters in 1735. Curll moved his shop again in that year and called it \\"Pope's Head\\" and sold under the sign of Pope. Two years later, he published five volumes of Pope's letters. In 1741, Pope finally prevailed against Curll in the courts. A court ruled that letters affix copyright to the author, although a recipient of a letter has no copyright status.  Merryland  In his last years Curll published a series of \\"Merryland\\" books which constitute a major contribution to the somewhat peculiar genre of English seventeenth and eighteenth century erotic fiction in which the female body (and sometimes the male) was described in terms of topographical metaphor. The earliest work in this genre seems to be Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland (1684) probably by Charles Cotton. This was included, in abbreviated form, in Curll's The Potent Ally: or Succours from Merryland (1741). Other works published by Curll include A New Description of Merryland. Containing a Topographical, Geographical and Natural History of that Country (1740) by Thomas Stretzer (of whom nothing is known), Merryland Displayed (1741) and set of maps entitled A Compleat Set of Charts of the Coasts of Merryland (1745).Paul Baines and Pat Rogers (2007) Edmund Curll: Bookseller.

It was purchased in 1989 by the US marketing services conglomerate Omnicom. Its lineage can be directly traced to today's agency operation Adam & Eve DDB London. History BMP was founded in October 1968 by Martin Boase, Gabe Massimi, Stanley Pollitt and seven other executives who had previously worked at Pritchard Wood. The group struck out on their own after a failed attempt to buy the Pritchard Wood operation from its parent.BMP at the Ad Age Encyclopedia Massimi left the firm in 1971. Stanley Pollitt is co-credited with inventing the job discipline of account planning at Pritchard Wood. He died following a heart attack in 1979, an event which dealt a blow to the agency's momentum.BMP at the Ad Age Encyclopedia In 1977, the French advertising holding group Havas of France paid ¬£1.5m for a 50% stake in BMP. It later sold its holding back to BMP. In 1983, BMP floated on the London Stock Exchange valued at ¬£16 million. After a hostile bid by the French company BDDP, BMP was bought in 1989 for ¬£125 million ($200 million) by DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, the giant American marketing services holding company and thence became known as BMP DDB. In January 2004 the company name was officially changed to DDB London, in line with the DDB network's decision to rebrand agencies it had acquired worldwide. Clients and reputation Cadbury-Schweppes moved to the new agency at its foundation. The firm had been a client of Pritchard Wood, and BMP's first campaign was for Cadbury's Smash, a powdered mashed-potato mix. Other early BMP campaigns included the Cresta bear (\\"it's frothy, man\\"), Hofmeister bear, the Humphreys, and John Smith's Arkwright - all the work of creative director John Webster (1934-2006).BMP at The History of Advertising Trust The company had a strong relationship with the Labour Party, dating from the early 1970s when it placed press advertisements for the TUC, attacking the then-Conservative government's Industrial Relations Bill. BMP created the advertising for the Labour Party in several successive general election campaigns. Chris Powell, BMP DDB Needham's chief executive until 2004, is the brother of Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, and several people who served in the Labour Party's Shadow Communications Agency came from BMP. A poll in 2000 that selected the UK's top 100 television commercials found that 16 were produced by BMP DDB, of which 11 were created by John Webster. An example was the BMP advertisement for the Barclaycard credit card, featuring an accident-prone card user, later expanded into the character of Johnny English played by Rowan Atkinson.

Buddhism has had a major influence on the development of Japanese society and remains an influential aspect of the culture to this day.Asia Society Buddhism in Japan, accessed July 2012 According to the Japanese Government's Agency for Cultural Affairs estimate, as of the end of 2018, with about 84 million or about 67% of the Japanese population, Buddhism was the religion in Japan with the second most adherents, next to Shintoism, though a large number of people practice elements of both. There are a wide range of estimates, however; the Pew Research Center estimated 36.2% of the population in 2010 practiced Buddhism. The Japanese General Social Survey places the figure at less than 20% of the population in 2017, and along with the 2013 Japanese National Character Survey, shows that roughly 70% of the population do not adhere to any religious beliefs. In modern times, Japan's popular schools of Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon Buddhism and Zen. About 60% of the Japanese have a Butsudan (Buddhist shrine) in their homes.Japanese Saints: Mormons in the Land of the Rising Sun, John Patrick Hoffmann, Lexington Books, 2007 p. 37 History of Japanese Buddhism =Arrival of Buddhism in China along the Silk Road= The arrival of Buddhism in China is ultimately a consequence of the first contacts between China and Central Asia, where Buddhism had spread from the Indian subcontinent. These contacts occurred with the opening of the Silk Road in the 2nd century BCE, following the travels of Zhang Qian between 138 and 126 BCE. These contacts culminated with the official introduction of Buddhism in China in 67 CE. Historians generally agree that by the middle of the 1st century, the religion had penetrated to areas north of the Huai River in China.Hoffman, Michael, \\"Buddhism's arrival, Shinto's endurance\\", Japan Times, March 14, 2010, p. 7. =Kofun period (250 to 538)= According to the Book of Liang, which was written in 635, five Buddhist monks from Gandhara traveled to Japan in 467. At the time, they referred to Japan as Fusang (), the name of a mythological country to the extreme east beyond the sea: =Asuka Period (538 to 710) and Nara Period (710‚Äì794)= Pagoda of Yakushi-ji in Nara (730) Although there are records of Buddhist monks from China coming to Japan before the Asuka Period, the \\"official\\" introduction of Buddhism to Japan is dated to 552 in Nihon Shoki when King Seong of Baekje (ËÅñÊòéÁéã, now western Korea) sent a mission to the Emperor Kinmei that included Buddhist monks or nuns together with an image of Buddha and a number of sutras to introduce Buddhism. The powerful Soga clan played a key role in the early spread of Buddhism in the country. Initial uptake of the new faith was slow, and Buddhism only started to spread some years later when Empress Suiko openly encouraged the acceptance of Buddhism among all Japanese people. According to legend, in 552, there was an attempt to destroy a tooth relic, one of the first of Buddha's to arrive in the country; it was hit by a hammer into an anvil. The hammer and anvil were destroyed but the tooth was not. On January 15, 593, Soga no Umako ordered relics of Buddha deposited inside the foundation stone under the pillar of a pagoda at Asuka-dera. In 607, in order to obtain copies of sutras, an imperial envoy was dispatched to Sui China. As time progressed and the number of Buddhist clergy increased, the offices of S≈çj≈ç (archbishop) and S≈çzu (bishop) were created. By 627, there were 46 Buddhist temples, 816 Buddhist priests, and 569 Buddhist nuns in Japan. Six sects The initial period saw the six great Chinese schools, called in Japanese were introduced to the Japanese archipelago: # Ritsu (Vinaya-focused Nikaya Buddhism) # J≈çjitsu (Tattvasiddhi, a sect of Nikaya Buddhism) # Kusha-sh≈´ (Abhidharma-focused Nikaya Buddhism) # Sanronsh≈´ (East Asian MƒÅdhyamaka) # Hoss≈ç (East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra) # Kegon (Huayan) These schools were centered around the ancient capitals of Asuka and Nara, where great temples such as the Asuka-dera and T≈çdai-ji were erected respectively. These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as \\"study groups\\". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the Asuka period and Nara period ‚Äì was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of \\"people‚Äôs priests\\" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and Daoist elements and the incorporation of shamanistic features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital. Tangmi The Late Nara period saw the introduction of Tangmi (Esoteric Buddhism, Japanese mikky≈ç) to Japan from China by K≈´kai and Saich≈ç, who founded Shingon Buddhism and the Tendai school, respectively. =Heian Period (794 to 1185)= By≈çd≈ç-in (Pure Land sect), located in Uji, Kyoto During the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto. Monasteries became centers of powers, even establishing armies of S≈çhei, warrior-monks. Shinto and Buddhism became the dominant religions, maintaining a balance until the Meiji-restoration. =Kamakura Period (1185‚Äì1333)= The Kamakura period was a period of crisis in which the control of the country moved from the imperial aristocracy to the samurai. In 1185 the Kamakura shogunate was established at Kamakura. This period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of Pure Land Buddhism, promulgated by evangelists such as Genshin and articulated by monks such as H≈çnen, which emphasize salvation through faith in AmitƒÅbha and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and Zen, promulgated by monks such as Eisai and D≈çgen, which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the culture of Japan. Additionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk Nichiren began teaching devotion to the Lotus Sutra. Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of Nichiren Buddhism, which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, \\"Buddhism.\\" Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition. Edited by Linda Woodhead, Christopher Partridge, and Hiroko Kawanami. Routledge, 2016, Location 2254 in Kindle Cloud reader edition =Muromachi Period (or Ashikaga) (1336‚Äì1573)= Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Sh≈çkoku-ji sect of the Rinzai school, located in Kyoto. It was built in Muromachi period. In the Muromachi period, Zen, particularly the Rinzai school, obtained the help of the Ashikaga shogunate and the Emperor of Japan, and accomplished considerable development. =Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573‚Äì1600) and Edo Period (or Tokugawa) (1600‚Äì1868)= After the Sengoku period of war, Japan was re-united in the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period. This decreased the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan. Neo-Confucianism and Shinto gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control.Japan Buddhist Federation, Buddhanet \\"A Brief History of Buddhism in Japan\\", accessed 30/4/2012 Japan closed itself off to the rest of the world. The only traders to be allowed were Dutchmen admitted to the island of Dejima. New doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the ≈åbaku lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the Edo period by Ingen, a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the Linji school, the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Manchu people, his teachings were seen as a separate school. The ≈åbaku school was named after Mount Huangbo (), which had been Ingen's home in China. Also notable during the period was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era Tripi·π≠aka by Tetsugen Doko, a renowned master of the ≈åbaku school. =Meiji Restoration (1868‚Äì1912)= With the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the new government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude, and a movement to eradicate Buddhism and bring Shinto to ascendancy arose throughout the country due to the strong connections of Buddhism to the Sh≈çguns. During the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism. Shinto became the state religion. Within the Buddhist establishment the Western world was seen as a threat as well as a challenge to stand up to. Buddhist institutions had a simple choice: adapt or perish. Rinzai and Soto Zen chose to adapt, trying to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity. Other schools, and Buddhism in general, simply saw their influence wane. The edict of April 1872 ended the status of the Buddhist precepts as state law and allowed monks to marry and to eat meat. This \\"codification of a secularized lifestyle for the monk coupled with the revival of the emperor system and development of State Shinto were fundamental in desacralizing Buddhism and pushing it to the margins of society\\".Yoshiharu Tomatsu, The Secularization of Japanese Buddhism: \\"The Priest as Profane Practitioner of the Sacred\\". Presented at the American Academy of Religion, Philadelphia, November 16, 1995 =Japanese Imperialism (1931‚Äì1945)= Japanese identity was being articulated in Nihonjinron, the \\"Japanese uniqueness theory\\". A broad range of subjects was taken as typical of Japanese culture. D. T. Suzuki contributed to the Nihonjinron by taking Zen as the distinctive token of Asian spirituality, showing its unique character in the Japanese culture. Nichirenism was one particular expression of Japanese Buddhist nationalism. During World War II, almost all Buddhists institutions strongly supported Japan's militarization.Gier, Nicholas, F.

However, due to secularization and the growth of materialism, Buddhism and religion in general continued to decline. =Post-war (1945‚Äìpresent)= Japan has seen a growth in post war movements of lay believers of Buddhism and a decline in traditional Buddhism in the 20th century, with roughly 100 Buddhist organizations disappearing every year.In Japan, Buddhism, long the religion of funerals, may itself be dying out by Norimitsu Onishi, International Herald Tribune, 14 July 2008 As of 2008 approximately 34% of the Japanese identify as \\"Buddhists\\" and the number has been growing since the 1980s, as Buddhists were 27% in 1984. Still, around 90% of Japanese funerals are conducted according to Buddhist rites. \\"In 1963, Tamamoro Taijo coined the term Funeral Buddhism that came to be used to describe traditional Buddhism in Japan as the religion engaged in funerary rites and removed from the spiritual needs of people.\\"Nika Efanova (2013), Funeral Buddhism: A Religion in Crisis, B.A. Thesis, University of Iceland, School of Humanities, Japanese Language and Culture Contrary to the ritualistic practice of traditional Buddhism, a revived modern form of Nichiren Buddhism led by lay believers Soka Gakkai \\"... grew rapidly in the chaos of post war Japan from about 3000 members in 1951 to over 8 million members\\" in 2000, and has established schools, colleges and a university, as well as cultural institutions. A study about the reason for the growth in lay believers and increased engagement in society attributes the cause to Nichiren teachings of 'social responsibility': \\"In the tradition of Nichiren Buddhism, however, we find the Lotus Sutra linked to a view of social responsibility that is distinctive\\". Via According to an academic study, lay believers of Buddhism \\"...offer an alternative view of Japan where their form of Buddhism would form the religious foundation of a peaceful and psychologically and materially enriched society\\".The Soka Gakkai and Human Security, D. Metraux, p. 49, Virginia Review of Asian Studies, Mary Baldwin College Japanese Buddhist schools :\\"East Asian Buddhism is very diverse in its teachings and monastic practices, and Japanese Buddhism, in particular, represents almost every strand of Buddhist teachings and practices. However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings.\\" (Authors: Kawananami, Partridge, and Woodhead p. 82.) In the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, S≈çt≈ç and ≈åbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return. Further, since then, many groups have split off from existing branches. =The Six Nara Schools= J≈çjitsu 625: Introduced into Japan. The (formerly known as the *SƒÅtyasiddhi) is considered to be an offshoot of the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya, an Indian SautrƒÅntika school of Nikaya Buddhism; however, the Tattva Siddhis position was also close to that of the Sthavira nikƒÅya. They were distinguished by a rejection of abhidharma as not being the words of the Buddha. It was introduced to Japan as J≈çjitsu in 625 by the monk Ekwan of Goryeo. In Japan, it was classified as one of the three approaches of East Asian MƒÅdhyamaka instead of a separate lineage. was one of the . Temple tiles from the Nara period, 7th century, Tokyo National Museum. Hoss≈ç 654: D≈çsh≈ç introduces . YogƒÅcƒÅra is based on an early Indian philosophy by masters such as Vasubandhu. Practices of this lineage are also known as \\"consciousness-only\\" since they teach that all phenomena are phenomena of the mind. The East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra school of Buddhism was founded by Xuanzang (ÁéÑÂ•ò, Jp. Genj≈ç) in China c. 630 and introduced to Japan in 654 by D≈çsh≈ç, who had travelled to China to study under him.Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F.

Literally: Three-Discourse School; a Madhyamaka school which developed in China based on two discourses by Nagarjuna and one by Aryadeva. Madhyamaka is one of the two most important Mahayana philosophies, and reemphasizes the original Buddhist teachings that phenomena are neither truly existent or absolutely non-existent, but are characterized by impermanence and insubstantiality. Kegon T≈çdai-ji, the head temple of the Kegon school 736: Bodhisena introduces the Kegon (Huayan or Avata·πÉsaka) school to Japan. The Kegon school was founded by c. 600 and was introduced to Japan by the Indian monk Bodhisena in 736. The Avatamsaka Sutra (Kegon-ky≈ç ËèØÂé≥Áµå) is the central text for the Kegon school. The Shin'yaku Kegonky≈ç Ongi Shiki is an early Japanese annotation of this s≈´tra. Rissh≈´ 753: Jianzhen () introduces the Rissh≈´ (Ritsu or vinaya school) to Japan. Founded by Daoxuan (ÈÅìÂÆ£, Jp. Dosen), China, c. 650 First Introduction to Japan: Jianzhen, 753. The Ritsu school specialized in the Vinaya (the monastic rules in the Tripitaka). They used the Dharmagupta version of the vinaya which is known in Japanese as Shibunritsu (ÂõõÂàÜÂæã) Kusha-sh≈´ The was one of the six schools of Buddhism introduced to Japan during the Asuka and Nara periods. Along with the and the Rissh≈´, it is a school of Nikaya Buddhism, which is sometimes derisively known to Mahayana Buddhism as \\"the Hinayana\\". A Sarvastivada school, Kusha-sh≈´ focussed on abhidharma analysis based on the by the fourth-century Gandharan philosopher Vasubandhu. The school takes its name from that authoritative text. =Esoteric Schools= Tendai 807: Saich≈ç introduces the Tendai (Tiantai) school to Japan. Known as Tiantai (Â§©Âè∞) in China, the Tendai school was founded by Zhiyi (Êô∫È°ó, Jp Chigi) in China, c. 550. In 804 Saich≈ç (ÊúÄÊæÑ) traveled to China to study at the Tiantai teachings, at Mount Tiantai. However, before his return he also studied, and was initiated into, the practice of the Vajrayana, with emphasis on the Mahavairocana Sutra. The primary text of Tiantai is Lotus Sutra (Hokke-ky≈ç Ê≥ïËèØÁµå), but when Saich≈ç established his school in Japan he incorporated the study and practice of Vajrayana as well. Although the studies of the Lotus Sutra and Mahayana Nirvana Sutra were also very vital to the schools as well. These schools developed in the Middle Ages and were influenced by the Tientai, Chinese schools of the sixth century. Shingon Buddhism Chishaku-in, main temple of Shingon-sh≈´ Chizan-ha. 816: K≈´kai founds . One of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan today and one of the few surviving Vajrayana lineages in East Asia, it originally spread from India to China through traveling monks such as Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra. Known in Chinese as the Tangmi, these esoteric teachings would flourish in Japan under the auspices of a Buddhist monk named , who traveled to Tang China in 804 as part of the same expedition as Saich≈ç. In the capital he studied Tangmi and Sanskrit and received initiation from Huiguo. On returning to Japan, K≈´kai eventually managed to establish Shingon as a school in its own right. K≈´kai received two lineages of teaching‚Äîone based on the and the other based on the .

During the Edo (1600‚Äì1868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the Meiji restoration (1868‚Äì1912). Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the Danka or terauke system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (terauke), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control. =Artistic influence= thumbupright=1.6Iconographical evolution of the Wind God. Left: Greek wind god from Hadda, Afghanistan, 2nd century. Middle: wind god from Kizil Caves, Tarim Basin, 7th century. Right: Japanese wind god F≈´jin, 17th century. In Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the Asuka period (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art. Buddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the Hercules inspiration behind the Nio guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in Kamakura. Deities Iconographical evolution from the Greek god Heracles to the Japanese god Shukong≈çshin. From left to right: 1) Heracles (Louvre Museum). 2) Heracles on coin of Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius I. 3) Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha, depicted as Heracles in the Greco- Buddhist art of Gandhara. 4) Shukong≈çshin, manifestation of Vajrapani, as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan. Various other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god F≈´jin. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \\"wind bag\\" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features. Another Buddhist deity, Shukong≈çshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the Silk Road. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent Vajrapani, the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples. Artistic motifs Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century. The artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings. =Architecture and Temples= Soga no Umako built H≈çk≈ç-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as Asuka-dera for Asuka, the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early Shinto shrines, early Buddhist temples were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early Heian period (9th‚Äì10th century) saw an evolution of style based on the mikky≈ç sects Tendai and Shingon Buddhism. The Daibutsuy≈ç style and the Zensh≈´y≈ç style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century. Buddhist holidays =Obon („ÅäÁõÜ)= Although its date and practices vary region to region, the Bon Festival is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold family reunions.

Occasional intersections between Western civilization and the Buddhist world have been occurring for thousands of years. The first Westerners to become Buddhists were Greeks who settled in Bactria and India during the Hellenistic period. They became influential figures during the reigns of the Indo-Greek kings, whose patronage of Buddhism led to the emergence of Greco-Buddhism and Greco-Buddhist art. There was little contact between the Western and Buddhist cultures during most of the Middle Ages but the early modern rise of global trade and mercantilism, improved navigation technology and the European colonization of Asian Buddhist countries led to increased knowledge of Buddhism among Westerners. This increased contact led to various responses from Buddhists and Westerners throughout the modern era. These include religious proselytism, religious polemics and debates (such as the Sri Lankan Panadura debate), Buddhist modernism, Western convert Buddhists and the rise of Buddhist studies in Western academia. During the 20th century, there was a growth in Western Buddhism due to various factors such as immigration, globalization, the decline of Christianity and increased interest among Westerners. The various schools of Buddhism are now established in all major Western countries making up a small minority in the United States (1% in 2017), Europe (0.2% in 2010), Australia (2.4% in 2016) and New Zealand (1.5% in 2013).Cox, Daniel; Jones, Ribert P.

Heracles depiction of Vajrapani as the protector of the Buddha, 2nd century Gandhara, British Museum. The first contact between Western culture and Buddhist culture occurred during Alexander the Great's conquest of India. After Alexander's conquest, Greek colonists established cities and kingdoms in Bactria and India where Buddhism was thriving.S. Dhammika, The Edicts of King Ashoka The Fourteen Rock Edicts/13Doumanis, Nicholas. A History of Greece Palgrave Macmillan, 16 Dec. 2009 p 64 This cultural interaction saw the emergence of Greco-Buddhism and Greco-Buddhist art, especially within the Gandharan civilization which covered a large part of modern-day northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan.Halkias, G. (2014) When the Greeks Converted the Buddha: Asymmetrical Transfers of Knowledge in Indo-Greek Cultures Greek sculptors in the classical tradition came to teach their skills to Indian sculptors resulting in the distinctive style of Greco- Buddhist art in stone and stucco seen in hundreds of Buddhist monasteries which are still being discovered and excavated in this region. Greco-Buddhism was an important religion among the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. The Indo-Greek kings such as Menander I (165/155 ‚Äì130 BCE) and Menander II (90‚Äì85 BCE) used Buddhist symbolism in their coins. Menander I is a main character of the Indian Buddhist scripture known as Milinda Panha (\\"The Questions of King Milinda\\"), which states that he adopted the Buddhist religion.The Questions of King Milinda, Translation by T. W. Rhys Davids, 1890 The Buddhist tradition considers Menander as a great benefactor of the Dharma, along with Ashoka. The Mahavamsa mentions that during Menander's reign, a Greek elder monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alexandria\\" (possibly Alexandria on the Caucasus) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of a stupa showing that Greeks took an active part in Indian Buddhism during this period. Greco-Buddhist styles continued to be influential during the Kushan empire. =Pyrrhonism= Map of Alexander the Great's empire and the route he and Pyrrho took to India Alexander the Great's court on his conquest of India included the philosopher Pyrrho who was influenced in creating his philosophy, Pyrrhonism, by the Buddhist three marks of existence. The Pyrrhonists promote suspending judgment (epoch√©) about dogma (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia, a soteriological objective similar to nirvana. This is similar to the practices described in the A·π≠·π≠hakavagga, one of the oldest Buddhist texts, and it is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non- conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna's \\"relinquishing of all views (drsti)\\". Later Pyrrhonism substantially parallels the teachings of Madhyamaka Buddhism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus,Adrian Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism 2008 Thomas McEvilleyThomas McEvilley, The Shape of Ancient Thought 2002 pp499-505 and Matthew Nealehttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:347ed882-f7ac-4098-908f-5bb391462a6c/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe;_filename=THESIS01&type;_of_work=Thesishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMZwyPdY7eg&t;=52s suspect that NƒÅgƒÅrjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. =Buddhism and the Roman world= Extent of Buddhism and trade routes in the 1st century AD. Several instances of interaction between Buddhism and the Roman Empire are documented by Classical and early Christian writers. Roman historical accounts describe an embassy sent by the Indian king Pandion (Pandya?), also named Porus, to Augustus around 13 CE. The embassy was travelling with a diplomatic letter in Greek, and one of its members‚Äîcalled Zarmanochegas‚Äîwas an Indian religious man (sramana) who burned himself alive in Athens to demonstrate his faith. The event created a sensation and was described by Nicolaus of Damascus, who met the embassy at Antioch, and related by Strabo (XV,1,73) and Dio Cassius. These accounts at least indicate that Indian religious men (Sramanas, to which the Buddhists belonged, as opposed to Hindu Brahmanas) were visiting Mediterranean countries. However, the term sramana is a general term for Indian religious man in Jainism, Buddhism, and ƒÄjƒ´vika. It is not clear which religious tradition the man belonged to in this case. Early 3rd‚Äì4th century Christian writers such as Hippolytus and Epiphanius write about a figure called Scythianus, who visited India around 50 CE from where he brought \\"the doctrine of the Two Principles\\". According to Cyril of Jerusalem, Scythianus' pupil Terebinthus presented himself as a \\"Buddha\\" (\\"He called himself Buddas\\") and taught in Palestine, Judaea and Babylon. = Buddhism and Christianity = The influential early Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (died AD 215) mentioned Buddha (ŒíŒøœçœÑœÑŒ±):Clement of Alexandria Stromata. BkI, Ch XV http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.vi.iv.i.xv.html (Accessed 19 Dec 2012) > Among the Indians are those philosophers also who follow the precepts of > Boutta, whom they honour as a god on account of his extraordinary sanctity. The myth of the birth of the Buddha was also known: a fragment of Archelaos of Carrha (278 AD) mentions the Buddha's virgin-birth, and Saint Jerome (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says \\"was born from the side of a virgin\\". The legend of Christian saints Barlaam and Josaphat draws on the life of the Buddha.John Walbridge The Wisdom of the Mystic East: Suhrawardƒ´ and Platonic Orientalism Page 129 ‚Äì 2001 \\"The form B≈´dhƒ´saf is the original, as shown by Sogdian form Pwtysfi and the early New Persian form Bwdysf. ... On the Christian versions see A. S. Geden, Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v. \\"Josaphat, Barlaam and,\\" and M. P. Alfaric, ...\\" In the 13th century, international travelers, such as Giovanni de Piano Carpini and William of Ruysbroeck, sent back reports of Buddhism to the West and noted some similarities with Nestorian Christian communities.Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 160 The famous travel writer Marco Polo (1254 ‚Äì 1324) wrote much about Buddhism, its rites and customs, in places such as Khotan, China and Sri Lanka.  Early modern and colonial encounters  When European Christians made more direct contact with Buddhism in the early 16th century, Jesuit missionaries to Asia such as St. Francis Xavier and Ippolito Desideri sent back detailed accounts of Buddhist doctrine and practices. Ippolito Desideri spent a long time in Tibet, learning the Tibetan language and Tibetan Buddhist doctrine before writing an account of his travels and of Tibetan Buddhism.de Jong, J.W. A Brief History of Buddhist Studies in Europe and America, The Eastern Buddhist NEW SERIES, Vol. 7, No. 2 (October, 1974), pp. 49-82 He also wrote several books in Tibetan which promoted Christianity and critiqued Buddhism. Other influential Jesuit writers on Buddhism Alessandro Valignano (1539-1606) and Matteo Ricci (1552-1610).Berkwitz, Stephen, The Portuguese Discovery of Buddhism: Locating Religion in Early Modern Asia. The Portuguese colonial efforts in Sri Lanka during the 16th and 17th centuries saw some of the first large scale direct contact between Buddhists and Westerners. According to Stephen Berkwitz, by the late 17th century, \\"the existence of a religion across Asia that worshiped images of the Buddha, known and referred to by many different names, was a well-known fact among European scholars.\\" This recognition that Buddhism was indeed a distinct Asian religion with its own texts and not just a form of local paganism, led Catholic missionaries to see Buddhism as a serious rival to Christianity in Asia and to promote its further study so as to combat it. They also sought to explain how such a religion could exist which appeared to deviate from those originating from divine revelation and yet also contained numerous similarities (monastic orders, virgin birth of its founder, belief in heaven and hell, etc.). Because of this, many Portuguese writers explained the Buddhist religion as a form of Christianity corrupted by the devil and some even said Buddhists were \\"in league with the devil\\". Catholic missionaries in Asia especially criticized the Buddhist view of rebirth, their \\"idol worship\\" and their denial of the immortality of the soul or a first cause. With the arrival of Sanskrit and Oriental studies in European universities in the late 18th century, and the subsequent availability of Buddhist texts, Western Buddhist studies began to take shape. An important early figure is Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo who first remarked on the connection between Sanskrit and Pali, and described an early Italian translation of the Kammavaca in his Systema brahmanicum.  19th century  Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Henry Steel Olcott, the first President of the Theosophical Society, in Colombo, 1889. During the 19th century, Buddhism (along with other non-European religions and philosophies) came to the attention of Western intellectuals through the work of Christian missionaries, scholars, and imperial civil servants who wrote about the countries in which they worked. Most accounts of Buddhism placed it in a negative light however, as a nihilistic, pessimistic, idolatrous and heathen faith.McMahan, David L, Modernity and the Early Discourse of Scientific Buddhism. Jules Barth√©lemy-Saint-Hilaire for example, described Buddhism as the nihilistic nadir of Indian pessimism. One early and influential sympathetic account was Sir Edwin Arnold's book-length poem The Light of Asia (1879), a life of the Buddha which became an influential best-seller. The book, coming at a time when Christianity was being challenged by critical Biblical scholarship and Darwinism, was seen by some Western intellectuals as promoting a more rational alternative to Christianity.Coleman, 2001, p. 56. This book eventually went through eighty editions and sold between half a million to a million copies. The growth of Spiritualism and Theosophy also contributed to the rise of interest in Buddhism. Some Theosophists actually converted to Buddhism, such as Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott who according to Stephen Prothero were \\"the first European-Americans to publicly and formally become lay Buddhists\\" in 1880.Prothero, The White Buddhist, 175. Olcott‚Äôs approach to Buddhism and the terminology of Protestant Buddhism and ‚Äúcreolization‚Äù (Prothero) is extensively discussed in K. A. McMahan,‚Äú ‚ÄòCreolization‚Äô in American Religious History. The Metaphysical Nature of Henry Steel Olcott, PhD dissertation, unpublished manuscript (Ann Arbor 2008). Olcott became a very influential figure in the Sinhalese Buddhist revival and in promoting the rise of a modernist Buddhism. He founded various branches of the Buddhist Theosophical Society in his first visit to Sri Lanka and wrote Buddhist educational literature. Seeing himself as an educator who was attempting to help the Sinhalese understand \\"real\\" Buddhism (based on a rational academic study of the Pali texts, not on \\"debased, sectarian, and creedal\\" local forms), he wrote an influential introduction to Buddhism called the Buddhist Catechism (1881), which proved extremely popular and remains in use today. While Olcott's Buddhism was influenced by liberal Protestantism as well as Theosophical ideas, Sinhalese Buddhists such as the famous Hikkaduve Sumangala supported his efforts and he became very popular in the island.Prothero, The White Buddhist. The Asian Odyssey of Henry Steel Olcott (Bloomington 1996), 1.Haas, Cornelia, From Theosophy to Buddhism The writings of Lafcadio Hearn were also influential in introducing Japanese Buddhism to Western audiences. = In Europe = The 19th century also saw the growth of the first thorough academic studies, publications and translations of Buddhist texts. The work of the French orientalist Eug√®ne Burnouf is some of the first academic work on Buddhism which includes a French translation of the Lotus sutra from Sanskrit. He laid the foundation for the study of Sanskrit Buddhist texts. He and Christian Lassen also published an early Pali grammar in 1826. Benjamin Clough, a Wesleyan missionary, also published an early grammar of the language in Colombo, 1924, A compendious Pali grammar with a copious vocabulary in the same language. The first Pali dictionary was published in 1875, Robert Caesar Childers' A Dictionary of the Pali language. The work of Emile Senart is also important, and includes a publication and study of the Sanskrit Mahavastu as well as his Essai sur la l√©gende du Bouddha, which interpreted the Buddha as a solar deity figure. 1881 was a seminal year for the new field now known as Buddhist studies. The Pali Text Society was founded in 1881 by Thomas William Rhys Davids, who was an influential early translator of the Buddhist Pali Canon. Another influential scholar in the field was the Indologist Max M√ºller, who edited Buddhist texts which were published in the Oxford series known as Sacred Books of the East. In 1881, Volume 10 included the first translations of the Dhammapada (M√ºller) and the Sutta-Nipata (Viggo Fausb√∂ll). Hermann Oldenberg's 1881 study on Buddhism, entitled Buddha: his life, his doctrine, his order (Buddha: Sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde), based on PƒÅli texts was also an early influential work which critiqued the solar myth theory. This era also saw Western philosophers taking note of Buddhism. These included the influential German philosopher Schopenhauer, who read about Buddhism and other Asian religions and praised their way of life in his works as the highest ideal.See Urs App, \\"Schopenhauers Begegnung mit dem Buddhismus.\\" Schopenhauer-Jahrbuch 79 (1998):35-58. The same author provides an overview of Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism in Arthur Schopenhauer and China. Sino-Platonic Papers Nr. 200 (April 2010) whose appendix contains transcriptions and English translations of Schopenhauer's early notes about Asian religions including Buddhism.Wicks, Robert, \\"Arthur Schopenhauer\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = Schopenhauer later claimed that Buddhism was the \\"best of all possible religions.\\"Urs App, Richard Wagner and Buddhism, pg 17 Schopenhauer's view of human suffering as arising from striving or Will and his compassion-based ethics have been compared to Buddhism.Hutton, Kenneth Compassion in Schopenhauer and ≈öƒÅntideva. Journal of Buddhist Ethics Vol. 21 (2014) and (2009) Ethics in Schopenhauer and Buddhism. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow http://theses.gla.ac.uk/912/.oregonstate.edu page on Schopenhauer & Buddhism http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Schopenhauer/schopenhauer.html There are frequent mentions of Buddhism in the work of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who praised Buddhism in his 1895 work The Anti-Christ, calling it \\"a hundred times more realistic than Christianity\\" because it is atheistic, phenomenalistic and anti-metaphysical.Pana√Øoti, Antoine, Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p. 49. Nietzsche wrote that \\"Buddhism already has -- and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity -- the self-deception of moral concepts behind it -- it stands, in my language, Beyond Good and Evil.\\"Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ, R. J. Hollingdale (Trans and Ed.) (Harmondsworth: Penguin), No. 20, p.129. However, he also saw Buddhism as a kind of life-denying nihilistic religion.Elman, Benjamin A. Nietzsche and Buddhism, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 44, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1983), pp. 671-686. Thus, even though Nietzsche saw himself as undertaking a similar project to the Buddha, writing in 1883 ‚ÄúI could become the Buddha of Europe,‚Äù he saw himself as consciously anti-Buddhist, further writing ‚Äúthough frankly I would be the antipode of the Indian Buddha.‚ÄùPana√Øoti, Antoine; Nietzsche and Buddhist Philosophy, p 2 Robert Morrison believes that there is \\"a deep resonance between them\\" as \\"both emphasise the centrality of humans in a godless cosmos and neither looks to any external being or power for their respective solutions to the problem of existence\\".David R. Loy, \\"Review of Nietzsche and Buddhism: A Study in Nihilism and Ironic Affinities by R.G. Morrison\\". = In North America = The first Buddhists to arrive in North America were Chinese immigrants to the West Coast in the 1848 Gold Rush.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 107. By 1875 there were 8 temples in San Francisco and many more smaller ones along the West Coast. They practiced a mixture of \\"Confucian ancestor veneration, popular Taoism, and Pure Land Buddhism.\\" At about the same time, immigrants from Japan began to arrive as laborers on Hawaiian plantations and central-California farms. In 1893 the first J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ priests arrived in San Francisco, and they formally established the Buddhist Missions of North America, later renamed the Buddhist Churches of America in 1899. The BCA is the oldest major institutional form of Buddhism in the United States.Seager, Richard Hughes, Buddhism in America, Columbia University Press, 2012 p. 73. This organization acted as way for immigrants to preserve their Japanese culture and language as well as their religion. Asian immigrants also arrived in British Columbia, Canada during the 1850s (to work as miners), and the old immigrant population was bolstered by new influx of Asian migrants after the 1962 Immigration Act and also as a result of the arrival of refugees from Indochina.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 122. Mining work also led Chinese immigrants to Australia (in 1848) and New Zealand (1863).Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 140. American Transcendentalist thinkers were interested in Eastern Religions, including Buddhism, though they were never converts. Emerson regarded Hinduism and Buddhism as anticipations of an ideal Transcendentalism.Andrew Ladd, Jerry R. Phillips, Karen Meyers, Romanticism and Transcendentalism: 1800-1860, p. 38. Thoureau meanwhile translated the Lotus sutra from the French.Rick Anthony Furtak, Jonathan Ellsworth, James D. Reid (editors) Thoreau's Importance for Philosophy, p. 215. 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago An important event in Western Buddhism was the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago organized by John Henry Barrows and Paul Carus. The Japanese delegation included the priest Soyen Shaku and the layman Zenshiro Nogushi and had four priests and two laymen, representing Rinzai Zen, Jodo Shinshu, Nichiren, Tendai, and Shingon. The Sri Lankan Anagarika Dharmapala was also present and gave a speech promoting Buddhism. He spoke English with a passion which stirred the audience and drew much attention. He would later come back to the US for a speaking tour across the nation at the behest of Paul Carus and officiated the first Vesak celebration in San Francisco (1897).Fields, Rick, How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America, chapter 8, II. On his third visit to America, he attended a lecture by William James, who gave up his spot to Dharmapala. After Dharmapala finished speaking on Buddhist psychology, James is recorded to have said \\"this is the psychology everybody will be studying twenty-five years from now.\\" In 1897, D.T. Suzuki came to the US to work and study with Paul Carus, professor of philosophy. D.T. Suzuki was the single-most important person in popularizing Zen Buddhism in the west. His thought was also influenced by Theosophy and Swedenborgianism. Suzuki's writings had a strong impact on Western intellectuals such as psychologists Erich Fromm and Karen Horney, poets like Alan Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac as well as on other figures like Alan Watts and Edward Conze.Coleman, 2001, p. 59. Through his writings Suzuki contributed to the emergence of a Zen modernism which blends Asian Buddhism with transcendentalism and romanticism. = Buddhist modernism = The works of the early important figures in Western Buddhism such as Henry Olcott, Paul Carus and Soyen Shaku promoted a kind of Buddhism that has been called by contemporary scholars \\"Buddhist modernism\\" and also \\"protestant Buddhism.\\" This new Buddhist discourse included various elements, but especially important was the idea that Buddhism was compatible with modern science and enlightenment rationalism. Olcott's Buddhist catechism is one example, which has a section devoted to Buddhism and science, which promotes the theory of evolution and affirms that Buddhism is based on the consistent operations of causality. He also argues that Buddhists are \\"earnestly enjoined to accept nothing on faith\\" and are required to believe only that which is \\"corroborated by our own reason and consciousness.\\" Paul Carus' encounter with Buddhism led him to believe that it was a great example of a \\"Religion of Science\\" and he became an enthusiastic supporter of it because he believed that it was the religion that \\"recognizes no other revelation except the truth that can be proved by science\\". His influential work, The Gospel of Buddhism, became quite popular and was translated in various languages. This kind of modernism was also promoted by Asian Buddhists in Asian countries, such as Anagarika Dharmapala. The rational interpretation of Buddhism as the \\"religion of reason\\" was also promoted by early Buddhist societies in Europe, such as the Society for the Buddhist Mission in Leipzig, Germany, founded in 1903 by the Indologist Karl Seidenst√ºcker (1876 ‚Äì1936) and the British Buddhist Society, in their journal The Buddhist Review.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 88. According to Heinz Bechert, Buddhist modernism includes the following elements: new interpretations of early Buddhist teachings, demythologisation and reinterpretation of Buddhism as \\"scientific religion\\", social philosophy or \\"philosophy of optimism\\", emphasis on equality and democracy, \\"activism\\" and social engagement, support of Buddhist nationalism, and the revival of meditation practice. 20th century Das Buddhistische Haus, a Theravada Buddhist vihara in Berlin, Germany completed in 1924.

Datsan Gunzechoinei in St. Petersburg, the first Buddhist monastery in Europe The 20th century also saw other influential Western converts such as the Irish ex-hobo U Dhammaloka and intellectuals such as Bhikkhu Asoka (H. Gordon Douglas), and Ananda Metteyya. U Dhammaloka became a popular traveling Buddhist preacher in Burma in the early 1900s, writing tracts and confronting Christian missionaries.Turner, Alicia (2010). \\"The Irish Pongyi in colonial Burma: the confrontations and challenges of U Dhammaloka\\". Contemporary Buddhism. 11 (2): 129‚Äì172. doi:10.1080/14639947.2010.530070. In 1907 he founded the Buddhist Tract Society in Rangoon to distribute pro Buddhist texts as well as other works such as Thomas Paine's Rights of Man and Age of Reason.Cox, Laurence (2010b). \\"The politics of Buddhist revival: U Dhammaloka as social movement organiser\\" (PDF).

Another influential figure was Charles Henry Allan Bennett (later Ananda Metteyya), who established the first Buddhist Mission in the United Kingdom, the International Buddhist Society and worked on a periodical called Buddhism: An Illustrated Review as well as two books on Buddhism (The Wisdom of the Aryas and The Religion of Burma). The Buddhist Society, London (originally known as the Buddhist Lodge) was founded by Theosophist and convert to Buddhism Christmas Humphreys in 1924.Bluck, Robert (2006).

Some of the earliest European institutions were also founded in Germany. In 1921, Georg Grimm (1868 ‚Äì1945) joined Karl Seidenst√ºcker in founding the Buddhist Parish for Germany in Munich. In 1924, Das Buddhistische Haus, was founded by Paul Dahlke in Berlin. Dahlke had studied Buddhism in Sri Lanka prior to World War I. Meanwhile, in France, Grace Constant Lounsbery (1876 ‚Äì1964) founded a Paris- based group called Les amis du Bouddhisme in 1929 who published a journal, La pens√©e bouddhique.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 90. The first Buddhist monastery in Europe was not founded by European converts however, but by Buryat and Kalmyk Buddhists of the Tibetan Gelug school led by Agvan Dorzhiev, who founded a temple in Saint Petersburg in 1909‚Äì15, Datsan Gunzechoinei. This temple was desecrated during the Russian resolution however, but survived the second world war and is now active.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 91. Throughout the 20th century, the Pali text society continued to be an influential publisher of Buddhist texts, by 1930 all the five Pali Nikayas had been published by the society (and numerous translations were also published). Buddhist studies also made numerous strides during the 20th century, headed by European academies and seen as comprising three \\"schools\\" during this period. Important figures include the scholars of the \\"Franco-Belgian school\\", such as Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin and his student √âtienne Lamotte, the Pali-based Anglo-German school which included figures such as Wilhelm Geiger and Caroline Rhys Davids and the \\"Leningrad school\\" of Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and Sergey Oldenburg.Guzel F. Mrathuzina, Russian Indology: Periodization, Science and Education Organization, Problematics and SpecializationGangodawila Chandima, A Critical Appraisal of the Contribution of Germany and France to Sanskrit Studies, 2010, p. 94.The Maha Bodhi, Volume 79, Maha-Bodhi Society., 1971, p. 60. Various Western converts during this period became influential figures through their Theravada Buddhist translations and writings, including the German monk Nyanatiloka Thera who founded the Island Hermitage in Sri Lanka and translated many important Pali texts into German. His disciple, the elder Nyanaponika, was a co-founder and president of the Buddhist Publication Society and author of the influential book on meditation, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation. The English √ëƒÅ·πáamoli Bhikkhu was another influential author associated with the Island Hermitage, known for his numerous translations of Pali texts into English.Buswell, Robert Jr; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2013). \\"√ëƒÅ·πáamoli Bhikkhu\\", in Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. . In 1954, Nyanatiloka and Nyanaponika were the only two Western-born monks invited to participate in the Sixth Buddhist council in Yangon, Burma. Nyanaponika read out Nyanatiloka's message at the opening of the council.Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, p.129‚Äì143, Pariyatti (2008). During the 20th century, there was an exponential increase in publications on Buddhism. The first English translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead was published in 1927, by Walter Evans-Wentz. He credited himself as the compiler and editor of these volumes, with translation by Tibetan Buddhists, primarily Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup.Donald S. Lopez, Jr. The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography, Princeton University Press, 2011. The reprint of 1935 carried a commentary from Carl Jung. The book is said to have attracted many westerners to Tibetan Buddhism.Shakya, Tsering \\"Review of Prisoners of Shangri-la by Donald Lopez\\". Also published in English in 1927, Alexandra David-N√©el's \\"My Journey to Lhasa\\" helped popularized the modern perception of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism at large. During the 20th century the German writer Hermann Hesse showed great interest in Eastern religions, writing a popular book entitled Siddhartha. In the United States, Japanese Americans founded the Bukkyo Seinen Kai, a Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) inspired by Christian institutions. This community had to deal with intense anti-Japanese sentiment during WW2 despite formal statements of loyalty issued by the organization. Many Japanese American Buddhists had to hide their family altars. The Japanese internment during the war accelerated Anglicization, because they were required to use English in the camps. There is also a generation gap in this community between the older immigrant generation and the American born Anglicized generation.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 56. =Post-war developments= The Dalai Lama receiving a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. From left: Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Senate President pro tempore Robert Byrd and U.S. President George W. Bush Thai Forest teacher Ajahn Chah with the senior representative of the tradition in England, Ajahn Sumedho (front right), the senior representative in North America Ajahn Pasanno (rear and left of Sumedho) and other monastics. After the Second World War, mainstream Western Buddhisms began to take shape, influenced by new Western writers on Buddhist thought and a new wave of immigration from Asian Buddhist countries. There was a dramatic rate of growth during the late 20th century. The Complete Guide to Buddhist America for example, listed more than one thousand meditation centers as of 1997 in comparison to the twenty-one centers founded between 1900 and the early 1960s.Prebish; Baumann, 2002, p. 109. Those Westerners disaffected with the materialistic values of consumer culture and traditional Christianity (such as the beat generation and later the hippies), as well as those interested a more sober altered state of consciousness or psychedelic experience, were drawn to eastern religions like Buddhism during this period (this is known as the \\"Zen Boom\\").Coleman, 2001, p. 61, 65, 67. Influential literary figures include the American writers Jack Kerouac (The Dharma Bums and The Scripture of the Golden Eternity) and Gary Snyder as well as the British writer Alan Watts (The Way of Zen). The steady influx of refugees from Tibet in the 1960s and from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the 1970s led to renewed interest in Buddhism, and the countercultural movements of the 1960s proved fertile ground for its Westward diffusion. Buddhism supposedly promised a more methodical path to happiness than Christianity and a way out of the perceived spiritual bankruptcy and complexity of Western life. In 1959, a Japanese teacher, Shunryu Suzuki, arrived in San Francisco. At the time of Suzuki's arrival, Zen had become a hot topic among some groups in the United States, especially beatniks. Suzuki's classes were filled with those wanting to learn more about Buddhism, and the presence of a Zen master inspired the students. Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner‚Äôs Mind (1970), quickly became one of America's Buddhist classics.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 91. He founded the San Francisco Zen Center during the middle of the 60s counterculture (1962).Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 98. Another influential figure is the reformer Hakuun Yasutani, who founded his own school called Sanbo Kyodan in 1954.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 93. Many of his reforms, while controversial in Japan, became de rigueur for Western Zen. These reforms focused on laypersons, who were given teachings and care that was traditionally reserved for monastics, the use of intense lay meditation retreats, and a minimizing of ceremony. Influential students of his are Philip Kapleau, Toni Packer and Robert Aitken. Philip Kapleau founded the Rochester Zen Center in New York in 1965. At this time, there were few if any American citizens that had trained in Japan with ordained Buddhist teachers. Kapleau wrote his seminal work The Three Pillars of Zen in 1965, which addressed the actual practice of Zen and the experiences which result. Robert Aitken, known as the \\"dean of American Zen\\", founded Diamond Sangha in Hawaii in 1959 which has grown into a network of affiliated centers and he also translated numerous Zen texts. He also founded the Buddhist Peace Fellowship along with Beat poet Gary Snyder and Joanna Macy.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 94-95. In 1969, Jiyu Kennett, the first woman to study at S≈çji-ji Temple since the 14th century, founded Shasta Abbey in California and was known for setting traditional Buddhist texts to Gregorian chant.Coleman, 2001, p. 68. In 1982, the popular Vietnamese Buddhist teacher and peace activist Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh founded the Plum Village Monastery in Dordogne, France which, along with his hundreds of publications, has helped spread interest in Engaged Buddhism and Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn (Zen). The sixties counterculture had already established an interest in Tibetan Buddhism, through Timothy Leary's publication of an adaptation of the so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead under the title The Psychedelic Experience.Coleman, 2001, p. 66. Since the 1970s, interest in Tibetan Buddhism also grew dramatically, especially due to the arrival of Tibetan lamas in the West after the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the creation of a Tibetan diaspora.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 113-114. This was fueled in part by the romantic view of Tibet and also because Western media agencies (especially Hollywood) and celebrities are largely sympathetic with the 'Tibetan Cause' and with the extremely charismatic and influential figure of the Dalai Lama.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 114. Tarthang Tulku was one of the first Tibetans to establish a center in the West in 1969.Coleman, 2001, p. 72. One of the most popular figures was Chogyam Trungpa, under the guidance of the Karmapa (Rangjung Rigpe Dorje), established institutions in the United States such as Naropa Institute and developed innovative teachings (Shambala training, introduced in 1977) which he saw as suited for Westerners.Coleman, 2001, p. 73-74. The Karmapa had originally told Ch√∂gyam Trungpa he would bring dharma to the west in 1954, long before Tibetan Lamas had any concept of Europe at all. In 1963 Trungpa made his first voyage to Europe. Later in Bhutan in 1968 he realized the West needed a very different approach to Vajrayana Buddhism. He then gave back his robes and went to North America. Another controversial and successful figure in bringing Buddhism to the West is Lama Ole Nydahl. They were wild hippies when he and his wife Hannah Nydahl first met the 16th Karmapa in 1969. The combining of lay and yogi style together as one, while using the traditional practices of Ng√∂ndro and teachings on Mahamudra is a distinct approach to bringing Vajrayana methods to Western lay practitioners.Bausch, Gerd, Radiant Compassion, The Life of the 16th Gyalway Karmapa, Volume 1, 2018 pp. 165-166 In response to the ever-increasing number of people interested in the \\"Tibet Message\\" Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa also established a study, retreat and meditation center in France ‚ÄúDhagpo Kagyu Ling‚Äù, founded in 1975, as the European seat of the Karma Kagy√º school. The Gyalwa Karmapa sent two particularly qualified teachers to Dhagpo: Lama Gendun Rinpoche, a great master of meditation, and Lama Jigme Rinpoche, an accomplished spiritual master. Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist teacher in the west is the much-travelled Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of Tibet, he is now a popular cause c√©l√®bre in the west. His early life was depicted in glowing terms in Hollywood films such as Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. He has attracted celebrity religious followers such as Richard Gere and Adam Yauch. All four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools are now established in the West. Tibetan lamas such as Lama Gend√ºn Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Geshe Wangyal, Geshe Lhundub Sopa, Dezhung Rinpoche, Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin, Lama Yeshe, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso all established teaching centers in the West from the 1970s. Tibetan Lamas and their Western students also worked to translate and publish Tibetan Buddhist texts, establishing publishers such as Wisdom Publications and Shambala Publications. In 1965, monks from Sri Lanka established the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, D.C., the first Theravada monastic community in the United States.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 136. The Vihara was quite accessible to English-speakers, and Vipassana meditation was part of its activities. However, the direct influence of the Theravada Vipassana movement (as known as the Insight meditation movement) would not reach the U.S. until a group of Americans returned there in the early 1970s after studying with Vipassana masters in Asia. Influential figures include Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield, and Joseph Goldstein, who in 1975 founded the now influential Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts.Latin, Don (2005-01-23). \\"Bridging Eastern and Western Buddhism\\". San Francisco Chronicle. In 1984, Kornfield helped found the Spirit Rock Meditation Center, the major center of this tradition on the West coast. According to Coleman, both meditation centers are \\"organized around a community of teachers with collective decision making.\\"Coleman, 2001, p. 78. A small number of Westerners who had ordained in the Theravada Thai Forest tradition have also moved back to the West and established more traditional monastic communities, such as Thanissaro Bhikkhu (founding figure and abbot of Metta Forest Monastery in California) and Ajahn Sumedho (who helped found Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in West Sussex). In England, an influential figure is Sangharakshita, who founded a modernist and eclectic new tradition called Triratna in 1967.Coleman, 2001, p. 82. In the 80s and 90s, the Buddhist Churches of America became involved in the debates over public textbooks promoting creationism and the use of prayer in schools. = Latin America = Zu Lai Temple (lit. TathƒÅgata Temple) in Cotia, Brazil is the largest Buddhist temple in South America. As a result of similar patterns of Asian immigration, globalization and Western conversion, Buddhism also became an established minority religion in Latin America in the 20th century, with adherents mostly common from the educated middle classes.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 299. According to Frank Usarski, Buddhism remains a statistically small part of South America's religious field, \\"with around 500,000 practitioners and approximately 600 groups\\" of which around 27% are Tibetan Buddhists, 25% are Soka Gakkai and 22% are Zen.Usarski, Frank, Buddhism in South America An Overview with Reference to the South American Context Japanese immigrants arrived in Latin America at the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 300. With the largest population in Latin America, Brazil is also home to the most Buddhists (around 230,000) in Latin America and thus plays a central administrative and spiritual role for Buddhism in the rest of South America. It was first introduced by Japanese immigrants in 1908.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 303. Rev. Tomojiro Ibaragi of the Honmon Butsury≈´-sh≈´ founded the first official Buddhist institution in the country in 1936, the Taisseji Temple. In the 50s and 60s, non-Japanese Brazilians sought out Buddhism influenced partly by translations of the works of DT Suzuki. They went to centers such as the Busshinji Temple of the Soto Zen school in S√£o Paulo and some of them later went on to become popular Zen teachers among Brazilians such as Rosen Takashina Roshi.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 305. In the 90s, there was a rise in interest in Tibetan Buddhism, and other forms of Asian Buddhism such as Thai, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese traditions are also present in the country.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 306. The first Brazilian Tibetan Buddhist center, the Tarthang Tulku Nyingma Center, was founded in 1988 in S√£o Paulo. In other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Peru, there was also the introduction of Buddhism through immigration and conversion, though populations remain small (20,000 in Argentina in 2012). Japanese Zen and Tibetan Buddhism has been especially influential in these countries in the post-war 20th century.Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 308-309. In 2010, there were also around 6,200 Buddhists in Cuba, in various Zen groups, the Diamond Way tradition and also Soka Gakkai (the only Buddhist organization with legal status on the island).Jerryson, Michael (editor), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Buddhism Oxford University Press, 2016, p 310. Contemporary Western Buddhism Hsi Lai, a Chinese-American temple in Los Angeles County, California. Completed in 1988, it is one of the largest Buddhist temples in the Western Hemisphere. Today, Buddhism is practiced by increasing numbers of people in the Americas, Europe and Oceania. Buddhism has become the fastest growing religion in AustraliaWhy is Buddhism the fastest growing religion in Australia? by Darren Nelson and some other Western nations.The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life - U.S. Religious Landscape SurveyAsian Tribune - Buddhism fastest growing religion in West Some of the major reasons for this spread include globalization, immigration, improved literacy and education (most Westerners are first exposed to Buddhism through books), and the breakdown of the hegemony of Christianity on Western culture.Coleman, 2001, p. 203-204. There is a general distinction between Buddhism brought to the West by Asian immigrants, which may be Mahayana, Theravada or a traditional East Asian mix (\\"ethnic Buddhism\\"), and Buddhism as practiced by converts (\\"convert Buddhism\\"), which is often Zen, Pure Land, Vipassana or Tibetan Buddhism.Coleman, James William, The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, p. 5. Some Western Buddhists are actually non-denominational and accept teachings from a variety of different sects, which is far less frequent in Asia. Demographically as a convert religion, Western Buddhism appeals more to whites and to the middle and upper-middle classes as well as to the politically left wing and to those who live in urban areas.Coleman, 2001, p. 192-94 While retaining a more formalized organization, Western Buddhism has also influenced the New Age movement and is in some ways similar to it.Coleman, 2001, p. 222. Western Buddhism has also been influenced by the insights of western psychology and psychotherapy and many Buddhist teachers in the West are licensed therapists.Coleman, 2001, p. 228-229. Major Western Buddhist publications include Lion's Roar (previously Shambhala Sun) and Tricycle: The Buddhist Review. =Contemporary modernism= Arapahoe Campus of Naropa University, a private liberal arts college in Colorado founded by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa. It was the first Buddhist-inspired academic institution to receive United States regional accreditation. The regular practice of meditation as a central focus is also a common feature of most modern Western Buddhist groups.Coleman, 2001, p. 119. The exception are those groups like Soka Gakkai which are chanting focused. Much of contemporary Buddhism in the West is influenced by the spread of lay practice centers, where laypersons meet for meditation practice and also may stay for meditation retreats.Coleman, 2001, p. 85. While rituals are not absent in contemporary traditions, they are less likely to be seen as providing supernatural benefits.Coleman, 2001, p. 97. The Vipassana or insight movement is one example that is particularly innovative and non-traditional. It is led by lay teachers, with democratic forms of organization and promoting mainly meditation with minimal doctrinal content and ritual. One feature of Buddhism in the West today (especially among convert Buddhists) is the emergence of other groups which, even though they draw on traditional Buddhism, are in fact an attempt at creating a new style of Buddhist practice. One of these is Shambhala, founded by controversial lama Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, who claimed in his teachings that his intention was to strip the ethnic baggage away from traditional methods of working with the mind and to deliver the essence of those teachings to his western students. His innovative Shambhala Training system was supposed to be a secular path for the cultivation of the contemplative life.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 133. Ch√∂gyam Trungpa also founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado in 1974. Trungpa's movement has also found particular success in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, Shambhala International being based out of Halifax. Other significant groups with new innovative and modernist approaches are the Triratna Buddhist Community (formerly the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order), which was founded by Sangharakshita in 1967, and the Diamond Way Organisation of Ole Nydahl, who has founded more than 600 Buddhist centers across the world. Diamond Way presents Buddhism in a modern context to lay practitioners, in over 30 languages. The \\"spiritual counsel\\" of the organisation is provided by the 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje (India), Kunzing Shamar Rinpoche (India) and Jigme Rinpoche (France).http://www.buddhism- foundation.org/export/sites/germany_stiftung/.content/documents/Diamond_Way_Buddhism_Foundation_articles_of_incorporation_2012.pdf =Branches= East Asian forms Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh and monastics of his order chanting during his visit to Germany in 2010. There are numerous East Asian Mahayana Buddhist traditions and communities in the West, which includes ethnic Buddhists and convert Buddhists. The oldest is the Japanese American J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Buddhist community of the Buddhist Churches of America.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 51. Another widespread form of East Asian Buddhism in the West is Soka Gakkai, a modernist lay form of Nichiren Buddhism. In the US, SGI also has a larger proportion of African American and Hispanic American members than other convert Buddhist groups.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 70. There are also many ethnic Buddhist temples, founded by Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean Buddhist immigrants. Ethnic Buddhist practice tends to be conducted in Asian languages and to be more traditional. Western-based Chinese Buddhist organizations are some of the most numerous immigrant Buddhists (especially in the United States) and include the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association, Fo Guang Shan and the Tzu Chi foundation.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 162‚Äì165. The most prominent of the East Asian Mahayana traditions in the West is Zen Buddhism, which was boosted by post-war popularity among the counterculture and influential figures like Shunryu Suzuki.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 90. Today it is a popular type of convert Buddhism, in various forms such as Japanese Zen, Vietnamese Thien and Korean Seon. According to Hughes Seager, in America, Zen is \\"primarily a movement of laity who practice monastic disciplines.\\" The \\"flagship\\" institutions of Zen in the United States include the Soto Zen San Francisco Zen Center of Shunryu Suzuki and the Zen Center of Los Angeles of Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi, as well as the Rinzai affiliated Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji and the Mt. Baldy Zen Center.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 95-96. The international Kwan Um school of Korean Seon is one of the most well known Korean Buddhist institutions in the West, while Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh's Order of Interbeing is one of the most popular modernist Vietnamese Thien international organizations. These institutions tend to be more liberal than their Asian counterparts, more lay based and more likely to promote gender equality. According to Hughes Seager, Western Zen \\"is Anglicized. It is democratized. It is tailored to the middle-class American life-style, with its focus on the workplace and nuclear family.\\"Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 111. Tibetan Buddhism The main stupa at Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, Scotland. Tibetan Buddhism in the West has remained largely traditional, keeping all the doctrine, ritual, guru devotion, etc. This is because the influential Tibetan Buddhist teachers in the West are still mostly Tibetans.Coleman, 2001, p. 104. An example of a large Buddhist institution established in the West is the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT). FPMT is a network of Buddhist centers focusing on the Geluk school, founded in the 1970s by Lamas Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 120. The FPMT has grown to encompass more than 142 teaching centers in 32 countries. Like many Tibetan Buddhist groups, the FPMT does not have \\"members\\" per se, or elections, but is managed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees chosen by its spiritual director (head lama), Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Besides the large organizations or networks such as FPMT, Diamond Way Buddhism, the Dzogchen community and Shambhala International, there are also numerous independent temples, centers and communities.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 124. These include Sravasti Abbey (USA), Kagyu Samye Ling (Scotland), and Lerab Ling (France). Westerners such as Lama Surya Das and Robert Thurman have also emerged as influential voices in the Western Tibetan Buddhist community. Theravada and Insight movement Spirit Rock Meditation Center founded 1978 by Insight teacher and student of Ajahn Chah, Jack Kornfield. Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, Asalha Puja 2014 There are different forms of Theravada Buddhism in the West. One of these forms is that taken by the Asian immigrant communities and their temples, which is the most traditional and conservative, but is still undergoing change and adaptation. Some of these adaptations include the development of institutions of higher learning for their monastics as well as the establishment of retreat centers, summer camps and schools for the lay community.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 136, 139. According to Paul Numrich, in 1996 there were around 150 Theravada temples (wats or viharas) in more than 30 US states.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 138. Some Westerners have also adopted and brought the traditional monastic forms to the West, especially those Western monastics associated with the Thai forest tradition. Representatives of this trend are the Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery in California, the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, in the UK and the Bodhinyana Monastery in Australia. At the other end of the spectrum are the much more liberal lay convert Buddhists belonging to the Insight meditation or \\"Vipassana\\" movement.Hughes Seager, 1999, p. 137, 148. Many of the founders of this movement studied in retreat centers in Asia and then moved back to the West to establish their own meditation centers, which include the Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock. They tend to keep ritual and ceremony to a minimum and focus on Buddhist meditation practice in lay life (and in retreats) instead of other activities such as making merit. This style of Buddhism is also influenced by western secular humanism and psychology and tends to be presented as a secular practice or technique rather than as a religion. =Issues with charismatic authority and sex scandals= A number of groups and individuals have been implicated in sex scandals. Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Ch√∂gyam Trungpa's Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are \\"... most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of charismatic authority that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization\\". Recently further sex abuse scandals have rocked institutions such as Rigpa organization and Shambala international. Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority. Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of religious narratives, such as lineages and dharma transmission, which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders. Popular culture Buddhist imagery is increasingly appropriated by modern pop culture and also for commercial use. For example, the Dalai Lama's image was used in a campaign celebrating leadership by Apple Computer. Similarly, Tibetan monasteries have been used as backdrops to perfume advertisements in magazines. Hollywood movies such as Kundun, Little Buddha and Seven Years in Tibet have had considerable commercial success.E.L. Mullen, \\"Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film \\" Buddhist practitioners in the West are catered for by a minor industry providing such items as charm boxes, meditation cushions, and ritual implements.  Temples and monasteries  The largest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere is the Nan Tien Temple (translated as \\"Southern Paradise Temple\\"), situated at Wollongong, Australia, while the largest Buddhist temple in the Western Hemisphere is the Hsi Lai Temple (translated as \\"Coming West Temple\\"), in Hacienda Heights, California, USA. Both are operated by the Fo Guang Shan Order, founded in Taiwan, and around 2003 the Grand Master, Venerable Hsing Yun, asked for Nan Tien Temple and Buddhist practice there to be operated by native Australian citizens within about thirty years.Nan Tien Temple The City of 10,000 Buddhas near Ukiah, California disputes that Hsi Lai Temple is the largest in the western hemisphere and claims it is the largest.The City of 10,000 Buddhas This monastery was founded by Ven. Hsuan Hua who purchased the property. \\"Dharma Realm Buddhist Association purchased the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in 1974 and established its headquarters there. The City currently comprises approximately 700 acres of land.\\"History and Background In 2006, a western ecumenical Buddhist temple called Dharma Bum Temple was founded in San Diego, California. The temple focuses on being an introductory center for westerners to learn more about Buddhism. It regularly hosts guest speakers from various traditions of Buddhism and is known for directing members to other Buddhist temples in the area after they start showing deeper interest in a particular form of the religion. Benalm√°dena Enlightenment Stupa is in M√°laga in the Andalusian region of southern Spain, overlooking Costa del Sol. Benalm√°dena Stupa (Chan Chub Chorten in Tibetan) is 33 m (108 ft) high and is the tallest stupa in Europe. It was inaugurated on 5 October 2003, and was the final project of Buddhist master Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche. The stupa is run by the non- profit Asociaci√≥n Cultural Karma Kagyu de Benalm√°dena, under the spiritual guidance of the 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje.Seegers, Eva, \\"The Innovative St≈´pa Project in Andalusia, Spain: A Discussion on Visual Representations of Tibetan Buddhist Art in Europe\\", The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions, pp. 27-30 See also * Buddhism by country * Buddhism in Australia * Buddhism in Austria * Buddhism in Denmark * Buddhism in Europe * Buddhism in Italy * Buddhism in Russia * Buddhism in Slovenia * Buddhism in the United Kingdom * Buddhism in the United States * Dharma Drum Retreat Center * Global Buddhist Network * History of meditation * Index of Buddhism-related articles * Secular Buddhism References Sources *App, Urs Arthur Schopenhauer and China.

The most well known of these campaigns in 1963 promoted the slogan, \\"Follow the examples of Comrade Lei Feng.\\"In Chinese, ÂêëÈõ∑ÈîãÂêåÂøóÂ≠¶‰π†. Lei was portrayed as a model citizen, and the masses were encouraged to emulate his selflessness, modesty, and devotion to Mao. After Mao's death, state media continued to promote Lei Feng as a model of earnestness and service, and his image still appears in popular forms such as on T-shirts and memorabilia.Yan Yunxiang: The Individual and the Transformation of Bridewealth in Rural North China, Department of Anthropology, University of California. The biographic details of Lei Feng's life, and especially his diary, supposedly discovered after his death, are generally believed to be propaganda creations; even the historicity of Lei Feng is sometimes questioned.John Fraser, The Chinese: portrait of a people (William Collins & Sons, 1980): \\"Lei Feng is an invention of the propaganda department. Perhaps there was someone once, even with the same name, who actually existed and did good deeds...But the Lei Feng all Chinese people know stretches credulity to special dimensions.\\"Nicholas John Cull et al., Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, (ABC- CLIO, 2003), . Quote: \\"Lei Feng, a soldier whose diary was alleged to have been found posthumously, was touted by the party as a model citizen; his diary‚Äîalmost certainly concocted by party propagandists‚Äîis filled with praise of Mao and accounts of Lei Feng's efforts to inspire revolutionary zeal among his comrades\\". The continuing use of Lei in government propaganda has become a source of cynicism and even derision amongst segments of the Chinese population.Fraser, p 100. Quote: \\"Lei Feng...is also a laughingstock among many Chinese youths, for the simplest of reasons: he never existed, at least not in the form served up by the Party\\". Nevertheless, Lei's function as a propaganda icon has survived decades of political change in China. Life The current biography of Lei Feng as given in China's state media says that he was born in Wangcheng (near the town of Leifeng, Changsha, Hunan, named in his honour), Lei was orphaned at a young age. According to CNTV, Lei lost all of his family prior to the establishment of the People's Republic. His father died when he was just five (killed by the invading Japanese Army),Chi-Yue Chiu and Ying-Yi Hong, Social Psychology of Culture, Psychology Press (2006), , p. 236 his elder brother, who was exploited as a child labourer, died a year later, and his younger brother passed soon afterwards. Finally, his mother committed suicide after being \\"dishonored by a landlord.\\" He became a member in the Communist youth corps when he was young and joined a transportation unit of the People's Liberation Army at the age of twenty. According to his official biography, Lei died in 1962 at the age of 21 (22 by East Asian age reckoning, by which a newborn is one year old at birth), when a telephone pole, struck by an army truck, hit him as he was directing the truck in backing up. Popular image Lei Feng, Chinese poster by Qiu Wei (). Caption reads: \\"Follow Lei Feng's example; love the Party, love Socialism, love the people\\". Lei Feng was not widely known until after his death. In 1963, Lei Feng's Diary was first presented to the public by Lin Biao in the first of many \\"Learn from Lei Feng\\" campaigns.Tanner, Harold Miles. China: A History. Indianapolis, Indiana: Hackett Publishing Company. 2009. . p.522. Retrieved 13 December 2011. The diary was full of accounts of Lei's admiration for Mao Zedong, his selfless deeds, and his desire to foment revolutionary spirit. Lin's use of Lei's diary was part of a larger effort to improve Mao's image, which had suffered after the Great Leap Forward.Spence, Jonathan D. The Search for Modern China. New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1999. . p. 566. Scholars generally believe that the diary was forged by Party officials under Lin's direction. The diary contains about 200,000 words describing selfless thoughts with enthusiastic comments on Mao and the inspiring nature of the Party.Osaarchivum.org The campaign began at a time when the Chinese economy was recovering from the Great Leap Forward campaign. During 1964 the Lei Feng campaign shifted gradually from doing good deeds to a cult of Mao. Chinese leaders have praised Lei Feng as the personification of altruism. Leaders who have written about Lei Feng include Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and Jiang Zemin. His cultural importance is still reproduced and reinforced by the media and cultural apparatus of the Chinese party-state, including emphasizing the importance of moral character during Mao's era. Lei Feng's prominence in school textbooks has since declined, although he remains part of the national curriculum. The term \\"Ê¥ªÈõ∑Èîã/Hu√≥ L√©i Fƒìng\\" (literally \\"living Lei Feng\\") has become a noun (or adjective) for anyone who is seen as selfless, or anyone who goes out of their way to help others. The CPC's construction of Lei Feng as a celebrity soldier is unique to the PRC and differs from the more typical creation of military heroes by governments during times of war. In the PRC, Lei Feng was part of continuing public promotion of soldiers as exemplary models, and evidence of the People's Liberation Army's role as social and political support to the Communist government. =Controversy among scholars= Details of Lei Feng's life, has not been subject to dispute. While someone named Lei Feng may have existed, scholars generally believe the person depicted in the campaign was almost certainly a fabrication. Some observers noted, for instance, that the campaign presented a collection of twelve photographs of Lei Feng performing good deeds. The photographs were of exceptionally high professional quality, and depicted Lei‚Äîsupposedly an obscure and unknown young man‚Äîengaging in mundane tasks. The lauded details of Lei Feng's life according to official documents led him to become a subject of derision and cynicism among segments of the Chinese populace. As John Fraser recalled, \\"Any Chinese I ever spoke to outside of official occasions always snorted about Lei Feng.\\" In a 2012 interview with the New York Review of Books, Chinese dissident blogger Ran Yunfei remarked on the moral and educational implications of the Lei Feng campaigns, noting the counterproductive nature of teaching virtues with a fabricated character.Ian Johnson, Learning How to Argue: An Interview with Ran Yunfei, New York Review of Books, 2 March 2012. A 2008 Xinhua survey noted that a large number of elementary school students have vague knowledge of Lei Feng's life, with only 32 percent of the surveyed having read Lei's diary. =Contemporary cultural importance= A bust of Lei Feng in Beijing, China, 2019. 5 March has become the official \\"Learn from Lei Feng Day\\" (). This day involves various community and school events where people go to clean up parks, schools, and other community locations. Local news on that day usually has footage from these events. Lei Feng is especially honoured in Changsha, Hunan, and in Fushun, Liaoning. The Lei Feng Memorial Hall (in his birthplace, now named for him, Leifeng) and Lei Feng statue are located in Changsha. The local hospital carries his name. There is also a Lei Feng Memorial Hall, with a museum, in Fushun. Lei Feng's military unit was based in Fushun, and it was here where he met his death. His tomb is located on the memorial grounds. To commemorate Lei Feng, the city of Fushun named several landmarks in honor of him. There is a Lei Feng Road, a Lei Feng Elementary School, a Lei Feng Middle School and a Leifeng bank office. Lei Feng's story continues to be referenced in popular culture. A popular song by Jilin singer Xue Cun (Èõ™Êùë) is called \\"All Northeasterners are Living Lei Fengs\\" (). A 1995 release, originally notable only for its use of Northeastern Mandarin, it shot to nationwide fame when it was combined with kitsch animations on the Internet in 2001. In March 2006, a Chinese organization released an online game titled Learn from Lei Feng Online (Â≠¶Èõ∑Èîã) in which the player has to do good deeds, fight spies, and collect parts of Mao Zedong's collection. If the player wins, he or she gets to meet Chairman Mao in the game. In the 21st century his image has been used to sell items including, in one case, condom packaging. As of 5 March 2013, popular interest in Lei Feng was minimal as ticket sales to feature-length biographical films, Young Lei Feng, Lei Feng‚Äôs Smile and Lei Feng 1959, released on Learn from Lei Feng Day failed to produce any takers at all in some cities. Reportedly, party cadres in rural areas have been charged by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television with organizing group viewings.

corporation that is mandated to operate intercity passenger rail service in Canada. It receives an annual subsidy from Transport Canada to offset the cost of operating services connecting remote communities. Via Rail operates over 500 trains per week across eight Canadian provinces and of track, 97 per cent of which is owned and maintained by other railway companies, mostly by Canadian National Railway (CN). Via Rail carried approximately 4.39 million passengers in 2017, the majority along the Corridor routes connecting the major cities of the Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor, and had an on-time performance of 73 per cent. History =Background= CNR Rapido train cars in Pickering, July 1968. In an effort to attract riders, new train cars were acquired by CN in the 1960s. Yearly passenger levels on Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during World War II. Following the war the growth of air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of mode share for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s it was obvious to both Canadian National Railway (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. CP sought to divest itself of its passenger trains, but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing them to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80 percent of losses. CN, being a Crown corporation at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as Red, White, and Blue fares, new equipment such as scenic dome cars and rail diesel cars, and services such as Rapido and the UAC TurboTrain trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines. These increases proved temporary; by 1977, total passenger numbers had dropped below five million. The decline of passenger rail became a federal election issue in 1974 when the government of Pierre Trudeau promised to implement a nationwide carrier similar to Amtrak in the United States. Starting in 1976, CN began branding its passenger services with the bilingual name Via or Via CN. The Via logo began to appear on CN passenger locomotives and cars, while still carrying CN logos as well. That September, Via published a single timetable with information on both CN and CP trains, marking the first time that Canadians could find all major passenger trains in one publication. In 1977, CN underwent a dramatic restructuring when it placed various non-core freight railway activities into separate subsidiaries, such as ferries under CN Marine, and passenger trains under Via Rail which was subsequently renamed Via Rail Canada. =Formation and early years= Cochrane station in August 1978. Earlier that year, CNR and CPR passenger rail service were spun-off into Via Rail Canada. On 12 January 1977, CN spun off its passenger services as a separate Crown corporation, Via Rail Canada. At its inception, Via acquired all CN passenger cars and locomotives. Following several months of negotiation, on 29 October 1978, Via assumed all CP passenger train operations and took possession of cars and locomotives. Passenger train services which were not included in the creation of Via Rail included those offered by BC Rail, Algoma Central Railway, Ontario Northland Railway, Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway, various urban commuter train services operated by CN and CP, and remaining CN passenger services in Newfoundland. At this time, Via did not own any trackage and had to pay right- of-way fees to CN and CP, sometimes being the only user of rural branch lines. Via initially had a tremendous variety of equipment ‚Äî much of it in need of replacement ‚Äî and operated routes stretching from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Prince Rupert, British Columbia and north to Churchill, Manitoba. Over 150 scheduled trains per week were in operation, including transcontinental services, regional trains, and corridor services. While Via remains an independent federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered by the fact that it was created by an Order in Council of the Privy Council, and not from legislation passed by Parliament. Had Via been enabled by legislation, the company would be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN have done in the past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via ‚Äî like Amtrak in the United States ‚Äî is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service. =1980s= LRC in Port Hope, October 1981. Via Rail ordered the LRCs in the 1980s to replace its older train cars. Greater numbers of passengers would not be Via's saviour. In 1981, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's government endorsed Minister of Transport Jean-Luc P√©pin's plan which slash Via's budget, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the company's operations. Frequently sold-out trains such as the Super Continental (which reduced Via to operating only one transcontinental train, The Canadian) and the popular Atlantic were discontinued. Via also sought to reduce its reliance on over 30-year-old second-hand equipment and placed a significant order with Bombardier Transportation for new high-speed locomotives and cars which would be used in its corridor trains. The LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) locomotives and cars used advanced technology such as active tilt to increase speed, but proved troublesome and took several years to work out problems (by 1990 only a handful of LRC locomotives remained in service which were subsequently retired by the arrival of the GE Genesis locomotives in 2001). The election of Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government in 1984 brought an initial friend to Via, when several of Mulroney's commitments included rescinding the Via cuts of 1981 by restoring the Super Continental (under pressure from his western caucus), and the Atlantic (under pressure from his eastern caucus and then-Saint John mayor Elsie Wayne). Prime Minister Mulroney's government gave Via funding to refurbish some of its cars, and purchase new locomotives, this time a more reliable model from General Motors diesel division. It was during this time on 8 February 1986, that Via's eastbound Super Continental collided with a CN freight train near Hinton, Alberta, as a result of the freight train crew missing a signal light, resulting in 23 deaths. By the late 1980s, inflation and other rising costs were taking their toll on federal budgets and in the Mulroney government's 1989 budget, Via again saw its budget slashed, surpassing even the 1981 cuts under Trudeau. =1990s= GMD FP7 leads the Canadian in Regina, May 1982. The Canadian was rerouted in the 1990s, ending service to several cities, like Calgary. Minister of Transport Beno√Æt Bouchard oversaw the reduction in service on 15 January 1990, when Via's operations were reduced by 55 percent. Services such as the Super Continental were again discontinued, along with numerous disparate rural services such as in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley and Cape Breton Island, western Canada, and in the corridor. The Canadian was also moved from its home rails on CP to the northerly CN route (previously plied by the Super Continental). The shift to the less-populated (and less scenic) route between Toronto and Vancouver severed major western cities such as Regina, Saskatchewan and Calgary, Alberta from the passenger rail network and flared western bitterness toward the Government of Canada. The official justification for the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. Harvie Andr√©, one of Alberta's federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly that he did not care if he never saw a passenger train again in his life. The Mulroney cuts allowed Via to consolidate its fleet of cars and locomotives, resulting in a fleet of refurbished stainless steel (HEP-1 and HEP-2 rebuilds, for head end power) and LRC cars, as well as rationalizing its locomotive fleet with GM and Bombardier (LRC) units. Via was not spared from further cutbacks in Jean Chr√©tien's Liberal government elected in 1993. Minister of Finance Paul Martin's first budget in 1994 saw further Via cuts which saw the popular Atlantic dropped from the schedule, focusing the eastern transcontinental service on the Ocean. CP had sold off a large portion of track the Atlantic had operated on and, as Via at that time was only mandated to provide passenger services on tracks belonging to CN or CP, the route was discontinued. This move was seen as somewhat controversial and politically motivated as the principal cities benefiting from the Atlantic's service were Sherbrooke, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick, where the only two Progressive Conservative Party Members of Parliament in Canada were elected in the 1993 federal election in which Chr√©tien's Liberal Party took power. The Ocean service which was preserved currently operates on track between Montreal and Halifax running through the lower St. Lawrence River valley and northern New Brunswick. The Minister of Transport in Chr√©tien's government at the time, Douglas Young, was elected from a district that included Bathurst, New Brunswick, on the Ocean's route. A remote Via service to Quebec's Gasp√© Peninsula, the Chaleur was also spared from being cut at this time, despite carrying fewer passengers than the Atlantic. Renaissance funding Via Rail P42DC pulling LRC coaches towards Montreal By the late 1990s, with a rail-friendly Minister of Transport, David Collenette, in office, there were modest funding increases to Via. Corridor services were improved with new and faster trains, a weekly tourist train, The Bras d'Or, returned Via service to Cape Breton Island for the first time since the 1990 cuts, and a commitment was made to continue operating on Vancouver Island, but western Canada continued to languish with the only service provided by the Canadian and a few remote service trains in northern BC and Manitoba. In a significant new funding program dubbed \\"Renaissance\\", a fleet of unused passenger cars which had been built for planned Nightstar sleeper services between locations in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel were purchased and adapted following the cancellation of the Nightstar project. The new \\"Renaissance\\" cars were swiftly nicknamed d√©plaisance (\\"displeasure\\") by French-speaking employees and customers, due to early problems adapting the equipment for Canadian use. Doors and toilets froze in cold Atlantic Canada temperatures, resulting in delays and service interruptions. New diesel- electric P42DC locomotives purchased from General Electric (GE) allowed the withdrawal of older locomotives, including remaining LRCs. LRC passenger cars were retained and continued to provide much of the Corridor service. This expansion to Via's fleet has permitted scheduling flexibility. Additionally, many passenger stations have been remodelled into passenger-friendly destinations, with several hosting co-located transit and regional bus hubs for various municipalities. =2000s= International with Amtrak coaches. The International route was jointly operated by Via and Amtrak from 1982 to 2004. On 24 October 2003, federal Minister of Transport David Collenette announced $700 million in new funding over the next five years. This funding was below the $3 billion needed to implement a high-speed rail proposal in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor nicknamed ViaFast; however, the funding was intended to \\"provide for faster, more frequent and more reliable passenger service across Canada... [preserving] the option for higher speed rail, such as the Via Fast proposal,\\" said Collenette. This new project was to be called \\"Renaissance II\\". On 18 December 18, 2003, Liberal Prime Minister (PM) Paul Martin announced a freeze in federal spending on all major capital projects, including Via's five-year $700 million \\"Renaissance II\\" program announced just six weeks earlier by outgoing PM Chr√©tien's administration. Critics of Martin's cuts claimed that he was in a distinct conflict of interest as his family through Canada Steamship Lines and various subsidiary and affiliated companies had once had a significant investment in the Voyageur Colonial Bus Lines, an intercity bus line in Quebec and eastern Ontario that is a key competitor of Via. Route cuts under the Martin government included the withdrawal of the seasonal Bras d'Or tourist train, which ran for the last time in September 2004, and the Montreal-Toronto overnight Enterprise, which was discontinued in September 2005. The Sarnia-Chicago International was also discontinued in April 2004 by Amtrak. Via's portion of the route from Toronto- Sarnia remained in operation as Via was able to use their own equipment to operate the train. Sponsorship scandal The federal Auditor General's report released publicly on 10 February 2004 showed what appeared to be a criminal misdirection of government funds intended for advertising to key Quebec-based supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada. Included in the Auditor General's report was the fact that Via was used as one of several federal government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations to funnel these illicit funds. Forced to act on the Auditor General's report due to its political implications, Martin's government suspended Via President Marc LeFran√ßois on 24 February 2004, giving him an ultimatum of several days to defend himself against allegations in the report or face further disciplinary action. Several days later during LeFran√ßois's suspension, former Via marketing department employee Myriam B√©dard claimed she was fired several years earlier when she questioned company billing practices in dealing with advertising companies. (According to CBC News, an arbitrator's report later concluded that B√©dard had voluntarily left Via.) She was publicly belittled by Via CEO Jean Pelletier in national media on 27 February 2004. Pelletier retracted his statements but on 1 March, Pelletier was fired. By 5 March, after failing to defend himself adequately against the allegations in the Auditor General's report, LeFran√ßois was fired as well. Increasing problems and reinstated funding F40PH-2D in Jasper, February 2011. Via's fleet of F40PH-2Ds were refurbished in the late-2000s to meet emission standards. The reversal of funding in 2003 led to a backlog of deferred maintenance and left Via unable to replace or refurbish life-expired locomotives and rolling stock. Conversely, Via ridership increased from 3.8 million in 2005 to 4.1 million in 2006. On 11 October 2007, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced federal government funding of $691.9 million over five years (of which $519 million for capital projects), and the remainder additional operating funding. The capital funding was earmarked to refurbish Via's fleet of 54 F40PH-2 locomotives to meet new emissions standards and extend their service lives by 15‚Äì20 years, refurbish the interiors of LRC coaches, reduce track capacity bottlenecks and speed restrictions in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor, and make repairs to a number of stations across the network. This announcement was similar in content to the previous \\"Renaissance II\\" package, and once again was criticized for not including new equipment or funding for services outside the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor. Shortly afterwards, documents obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act revealed that delays due to equipment failures had risen by 60 percent since the previous year. The company attributed this to problems with the aging F40 locomotive fleet. On 27 January 2009, the Government of Canada announced in its 2009 Economic Action Plan that it would increase funding to Via by $407 million to support improvements, including increased train frequencies and enhanced on-time performance and speed, particularly in the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor. On 21 July 2009, Via announced its engineers would go on strike as of 24 July if no deal was reached by then, and began cancelling all trains in anticipation of strike. The strike officially began at midnight on July 24 after it became clear that no deal had been reached. Engineers had been without a contract since 31 December 2006. Full service resumed on 27 July 2009. An additional strike by the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union, representing around 2,200 employees, was planned to begin on 4 July 2010, but was called off after the union and Via reached a three- year contract. =2010s= Via train cars at Qualicum Beach station, a stop on Victoria‚ÄìCourtenay train. The Victoria-Courtenay service was suspended in March 2010. Via experienced more service cuts at the dawn of the 2010. In March 2011, the daily Victoria‚ÄìCourtenay The Malahat RDC service on Vancouver Island was suspended indefinitely due to deteriorating track (it has yet to resume). By 27 June 2012, Via announced additional service cuts due to funding issues: * The Canadian was reduced from three days a week to two days a week beginning November 2012; service operated at twice weekly November‚ÄìApril during and thrice weekly May‚ÄìOctober until 2019. In 2019, only two trains per week operated on the full route, while the third train ran only between Vancouver and Edmonton once a week in each direction. * The Ocean was reduced from six days a week to thrice weekly beginning October 2012. * Corridor services west of Toronto were reduced, with weekend service reductions to Montreal and Ottawa, Ontario. * Corridor services to Sarnia and the Niagara region were reduced to once daily in October 2012, with additional taking effect in July 2012. Sarnia was left with a single daily round-trip. Niagara Falls lost all service except the joint Amtrak-Via daily New York City-Toronto Maple Leaf service, although Toronto regional commuter service was later provided by GO Transit. * Corridor services to Kitchener, London, and Windsor were reduced starting in October 2012, with at least two daily round trips surviving. * In September 2013, the Gasp√© service, which had been \\"bustituted\\" in 2011, was suspended indefinitely. To address declining on-time performance due to freight train traffic on Via routes, MP Olivia Chow drafted a private member's bill in 2014 that would reorganize the company and allow the government to force freight rail carriers to give scheduling priority to public passenger rail. However, as with most private member's bills, it was not passed. Service improvements The Quebec-Windsor corridor was the focus of service restorations and implements. A direct Ottawa-Quebec City train was restored, with additional trips between Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto being added. In 2016, LRC passenger cars used for the corridor were refurbished; in the Via 1 class, this included single seating. A passenger car adorned in Canada 150 livery, August 2017. For the country's sesquicentennial, Via released a special youth rail pass. In March 2017, Via announced the release of a new category of rail pass valid for the month of July 2017 (corresponding to Canada's sesquicentennial celebrations) for youth aged 18‚Äì25, costing $150 (several hundred dollars cheaper than a comparable rail pass would typically cost). A larger than expected response resulted in the temporary loss of functionality for Via's website. Despite plans to cap the number of passes sold at 1867 (the year of Canadian Confederation), over 4,000 passes were ultimately sold. The company received significant backlash, as it initially appeared there was no limit on the number of passes available. 2018‚Äìpresent Extreme winter conditions had always been an operational hazard for Via, with the Ottawa routes and Canadian being most vulnerable. Equally, summer repairs and construction often delayed trains systemwide, even though schedules were regularly adjusted in an attempt to minimize delays. However, by 2018, freight traffic on the heavily used CN lines had become a significant concern for maintaining on-time service. This issue arose due to typical siding sizes, which were not long enough to accommodate modern freight trains. Passenger trains were consequently placed on sidings whenever two trains passed (rather than freights), which meant that passenger trains did not have priority on CN lines. The issue existed in all parts of the Via network, although it became most extreme on the Canadian, where delays increased from an average of five hours to as much as 50 over the four-day journey. Via ultimately addressed the issue by eliminating its late policy on its cross-Canada trains but retaining it for the Corridor routes. However, Via continues to compensate inconvenienced guests with necessary hotel accommodations prior to the journey, as well as ensuring continued transportation where a connection to a second Via train had been missed. As such, compensation costs were factored into Via's 2018 budget. By the end of 2018, the full route time on the Canadian had been increased twice to absorb freight delays. The second extension ‚Äì to five days ‚Äì has been mostly successful in decreasing delays, and also allowed for a daytime transit of Hells Gate in BC, previously transversed overnight in the dark. The scheduled increased running time actually resulted in the Canadian arriving early on several occasions. However, Toronto-Vancouver service frequencies were reduced to only twice weekly during peak summer period, with a third Toronto- Edmonton run suspended entirely. On 12 December 2018, Via announced that it had awarded a contract to Siemens Canada for 32 train sets to replace the entire Quebec City-Windsor Corridor fleet. This marked the completion of a procurement process launched following the 2018 federal budget, which allocated funding for the fleet replacement. During the request-for-proposals stage, Via had narrowed the potential suppliers down to Siemens, Bombardier, Talgo and Stadler Rail. Siemens was ultimately selected after finishing first on the key criteria, which included the ability to deliver in a timely fashion, the quality of the product offering, and the price. The new fleet will consist of Siemens SCB-40 locomotives hauling a combination of coaches, business-class cars, and cab cars from the Siemens Viaggio Comfort series to allow bi- directional operation. The trains will be built at Siemens plant in Sacramento, California, and Siemens committed to including at least 20 percent Canadian content in the final product. The order includes an option for an additional 16 train sets to be exercised if the federal government approves Via's high-frequency dedicated-corridor project. The first train set is to be delivered for testing by winter 2021, with the first sets in service by 2022 and all trains in service by 2024. The delivery of the new trains will allow Via to retire LRC and Renaissance equipment from the corridor, and re-allocate the HEP2 and corridor-based HEP1 cars to other parts of the network. Budget and management Via is operated as an independent crown corporation and receives a subsidy from the Minister of Transport to provide service to remote communities. Via operates more than 500 trains per week from coast to coast. The sum of $369 million was earned from passenger revenues in 2018. Over 4.74 million passenger voyages were taken in 2018. An on-time ratio of 71 percent was achieved in that year. Over 3,115 persons were employed by Via by the end of 2018. Via president Yves Desjardins-Siciliano stated that the subsidy for passenger rail travel in Canada in 2015 was about 200 percent: for every $1 travellers spend on fares, Canada pays $2 in subsidy. As of May 2019, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Fran√ßoise Bertrand, while the President and CEO is Cynthia Garneau; there are 11 other persons on the Board of Directors at the same year. The Annual accounts of Via are audited to GAAP principles by the Auditor-General of Canada, under the Financial Administration Act. Via Rail Canada Inc. is incorporated under the CBCA and is subject to income taxes, should a profit ever be declared by it. The corporation had $9,300,000 in share capital as of 2018. Via also received $394.4 million of government funding in 2018. In May 2019, Cynthia Garneau was appointed as the new CEO of Via. She replaced Yves Desjardins-Siciliano, who completed his five-year mandate on 8 May 2019. =Expansion plans= Maritimes Via has explored the introduction of daily regional service in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (connecting Halifax, Moncton, and Campbellton) to complement the thrice-weekly Ocean service to Montreal. As of 2017, Via's statement was that it was \\"exploring an eastern intercity corridor service\\" and that further developments were dependent on infrastructure upgrades and equipment testing. Via has also expressed interest in operating commuter rail service on CN tracks in Halifax, Nova Scotia that would run from the city's downtown station as far as Windsor Junction. However, in June 2019, Halifax regional council voted unanimously to direct staff \\"not to pursue commuter rail service further...due to infrastructure requirements and associated financial implications, as well as operational considerations and restraints\\". High Frequency Rail Project (HFR) Via has developed a $4.4 billion \\"high- frequency rail\\" service plan as a response to delays faced by sharing tracks with freight trains. The plan opts for a dedicated track between Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City, offering more frequent trains (although running at conventional speeds). In Ontario, Via would run a new rail line on currently underused tracks from Toronto to Ottawa through Peterborough instead of Kingston. In Quebec, corridor trains would travel from Montreal to Quebec City through Trois-Rivi√®res on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River rather than on the south shore through Drummondville. Via claims this would allow them to run more trains in the corridor, reduce trip times by 25% and improve on-time performance to over 95%. Feasibility studies have been funded by the federal government since the 2016 budget, and the 2018 budget allowed for the funding of the fleet replacement portion of the plan, though not the dedicated rail lines. Contrary to expectations, the 2019 federal budget did not include a final decision for new funds for HFR. However, in January 2020 Via announced the hiring of a joint venture of engineering firms AECOM and Arup to undertake a detailed engineering study of the proposal. =Service suspensions= Two former Via routes ‚Äî The Malahat (service ended in 2011) and Chaleur (service ended in 2013) ‚Äî are currently suspended due to poor track conditions. Via plans to reintroduce service once track upgrades have been completed. The Quebec government announced funds for repairs to Chaleur trackage in 2017, with a completion date stated only as being \\"several years away.\\" No concrete plan to restore trackage along The Malahat has been announced . A Via F40PH-2D leading the Winnipeg-Churchill train, November 2012. The service was suspended from May 2017 to December 2018 for track maintenance. The Winnipeg‚ÄìChurchill train was disrupted by severe spring flooding on 23 May 2017, when the Hudson Bay Railway tracks were damaged beyond standard maintenance. Winnipeg‚ÄìGillam service continued. OmniTRAX, the original owner of the track, refused to make the repairs, saying that the track was no longer viable, despite the matching federal subsidy. The railroad was Churchill's only land link to southern Canada, and its loss resulted in significant cost-of-living increases for residents along the corridor (a stranded train was removed by ship in October 2017). Service to Churchill was restored in late 2018, after the tracks, Churchill port, and Churchill marine tank farm were purchased by Arctic Gateway Group. The federal government assisted in the purchase with $74 million of dedicated northern infrastructure money up front and an additional commitment of $43 million over 10 years. To restore passenger rail service before winter, Arctic Gateway repaired 29 washouts in 35 days. Although a special Via train arrived in Churchill on 1 November, the first regular Via train arrived in Churchill on 4 December, 560 days after service initially ceased. On February 13, 2020, following several days of blockades during the nationwide Coastal GasLink Pipeline protests, Via Rail announced that it would be shutting down most of its passenger train service across Canada until further notice, with the exception of the Sudbury‚ÄìWhite River train line and the Winnipeg‚ÄìChurchill train between Churchill and The Pas. Later in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all Via Rail trains were suspended with the exception of the Winnipeg- Churchill train as well as one train daily on each route within the corridor. Along with the previous protest-related service suspensions, it is the most extensive temporary reduction of service in Via Rail's history. Travelling on Via Travel on Via varies by region as much as class. Many of Via's policies and protocols are the product of running a national train system with varying pressures and needs of different passengers, communities, and contexts. The results are wide-ranging travel experiences depending on the distance and location of the journey. =Unscheduled stops= Some Via routes outside the corridor offer the option of unscheduled stops at places where there is no station. With 48 hours notice, a passenger can request to entrain or detrain at a specified milepost. This option is available on all the Adventure Routes, as well as the Canadian between Capreol and Winnipeg. =Classes of service= Economy-class seating in a Via Rail coach car, with one fully reclined *Escape Fare: Discounted seats from economy class, with restrictions on refunds and exchanges. *Economy: Economy class seating in coach cars. Passengers are usually assigned seats except trains 54, 97, 98, 650 and 651, where passengers are separated based on train cars according to destination. Snacks and beverages are sold by employees with service carts, in a lounge car, or in a restaurant car. Free Wi-Fi access is provided in the Corridor and on the Ocean. Corridor * Business: (formerly called Via 1): First-class seating available on most Corridor trains in southern Quebec and Ontario. Business class offers passengers individually reserved seats, more spacious seating, window blinds, inclusive hot three-course meals complete with complimentary wine and liqueurs, in-seat AC power outlets, and free Wi-Fi access. Business-class passengers are also granted priority boarding and access to business lounges at major urban stations. * Touring: Available on the Skeena only in peak travel months. Includes three meals per day, wine with supper, on-train commentary from the staff, and guaranteed access to the Panoramic and Park cars. * Sleeper Plus: Sleeping accommodations aboard overnight trains. This service class was formerly known as Sleeper in some cases, including on the now-suspended Chaleur. Available on the Canadian, Ocean and Winnipeg-Churchill trains. Options for this class on the Canadian include berth sections and single, double and triple bedrooms with bunkbeds and electrical outlets. On other trains, not all options are available. Also included are first-class meals in the dining car (not including alcohol), and access to the Skyline car and viewing salons in the glass-domed Park car, when available. Passengers are also given priority boarding and access to the Panorama Lounges at major urban stations. Each car has access to a washroom and, optionally, a shower. Access to business lounges where available or the Sleeper Plus Lounge in Halifax is available on departure day. * Prestige: Via's latest premium service offering available on the Canadian only. In addition to the Sleeper Plus amenities, includes modernized luxurious sleeping accommodations at the rear of the train, priority reservations in the dining car, a concierge, complimentary beverages (including alcohol), and schedule permitting, a free tour of select Winnipeg attractions. Access to business lounges is provided on both arrival and departure days in Toronto and Vancouver. =On board= Amenities A Via dining car preparing for the first serving of breakfast Smoking is prohibited on all Via trains. Smoking tobacco has been banned on the Corridor routes since 1993 and this policy was gradually extended to all trains, while smoking cannabis was banned on all Via routes on the same day it was made legal in Canada. The last remaining on- board smoking was permitted in a smoker's lounge on some long-distance routes, only at certain times of day until 2002. Washrooms are provided for each car. On sleeper cars, every private room has its own separate washroom. Food service varies by train. All trains save the Sudbury‚ÄìWhite River train offer snacks, light meals, and both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for purchase. Long-distance trains offer traditional sit-down dining and full meals to sleeper class passengers. Economy-class passengers can purchase hot take-out meals prepared in the dining car on long-distance trains during the peak season, and eat in the sit-down dining car in the off-peak. Complimentary Wi-Fi service is available in the Corridor. The present Wi-Fi system is provided by 21Net since November 2008. Previously, the Wi-Fi service was provided by Parsons commencing in February 2006. Via had upgraded the past Wi- Fi system during 2011 with technology provided by Nomad Digital.. Via was the first North American transportation service to offer Wi-Fi to its passengers in early 2006, and was one of the first in the world to do so. Wi-Fi is also available to travellers in all classes of service who may benefit from complimentary Wi-Fi service in many Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor corridor stations. Wi- Fi service has been added to the Ocean train in the service cars, and to the Canadian, although connections are unreliable in most places outside urban centres. Luggage A canoe being unloaded from a luggage car on the Sudbury‚ÄìWhite River train Via offers checked luggage on its longer-haul services; however, in the Corridor only certain trains have luggage cars. In older class cars there is sufficient space at the front of the car for luggage storage. In contrast, the Renaissance stock has enough space (underneath the seat) for only one small piece of carry-on luggage; the remainder must be checked. Accessibility and safety concerns Via offers pre-boarding assistance to those passengers requiring extra time to board its trains. Not all stations are equally accessible; some have high-level platforms or mechanical lifts. All Via trains are capable of accommodating wheelchairs, although capacity is limited. Routes and connections A map of Via Rail routes, showing the frequency of Via trains on it Via operates in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. The only province or territory connected to the continental railway network and not served by Via is the Northwest Territories. Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon have no rail connections to the continental network and thus no Via service. Via operates over 475 trains per week over 19 routes, marketed in four broad categories: * Ontario and Quebec/Corridor service: comprising frequent regional and local trains between major cities in a band from Southwestern Ontario to Quebec City. The vast majority of Via's trains ‚Äì over 400 per week ‚Äì operate here. Cities served by Corridor trains include Windsor, Sarnia, London, Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City. In 2017, corridor service accounted for 95 percent of Via's ridership and 77 percent of its revenue. * The Maritime Way/Ocean: providing long-distance service between Quebec and the Maritime provinces. In 2017, the Ocean accounted for 2 percent of Via's ridership and 3 percent of its revenue. * The Great Western Way/Canadian: providing both long-distance service between Southern Ontario and Western Canada, as well as essential rail services through Northern Ontario. In 2017, the Canadian accounted for 2 percent of Via's ridership and 20 percent of its revenue. * Adventure Routes: Five regional and long-distance routes that offer essential rail transportation in rural northern areas. In 2017, these routes in aggregate accounted for 1 percent of Via's ridership and revenue. The routes included in this category are: **Jasper‚ÄìPrince Rupert train (former name: Skeena) - Alberta and British Columbia **Montreal‚ÄìJonqui√®re train (former name: Saguenay) - Quebec **Montreal‚ÄìSenneterre train (former name: Abitibi) - Quebec **Sudbury‚ÄìWhite River train (former name: Lake Superior) - Ontario **Winnipeg‚ÄìChurchill train (former name: Hudson Bay) - Manitoba and Saskatchewan Unlike Amtrak, which gives every route a specific name, most Via trains are identified only by their route number and destination. The only named Via trains are the Canadian and the Ocean. The five \\"Adventure Routes\\" were previously branded as the Skeena, the Saguenay, the Abitibi, the Lake Superior, and the Hudson Bay, respectively, and may still be referred to by these names in local usage. =Track ownership= A Via Rail train passes by a Canadian National Railway train. The majority of the track Via operates on is owned by CNR. As of 2017, the mileage makeup of Via's route network by track owner/host railway was as follows: * 84 percent: Canadian National Railway * 8 percent: Hudson Bay Railway * 4 percent: Canadian Pacific Railway * 3 percent: Via Rail * 2 percent: Metrolinx (GO Transit) In total, about 88 percent of Via trackage is owned by a Class I railroad, 8 percent by a shortline railroad, and 5 percent by a government agency. =Connections= The Maple Leaf train outside Niagara Falls station. The route jointly operated between Via and Amtrak, providing Via riders with a connection to Amtrak stations based in New York. The Maple Leaf, operating between New York City and Toronto via Albany, Buffalo, and Niagara Falls, is jointly managed by Via and Amtrak. The train operates using Amtrak equipment, but on the Canadian side of the border is staffed by Via employees and operated as a typical Via train. Two other train routes link Canada and the US: the Adirondack (Montreal-New York) and the Amtrak Cascades (Vancouver-Seattle-Portland). While both of these routes share stations with Via at their Canadian termini, they are fully operated by Amtrak and single- ticket connections to Via trains are not offered. In addition to Amtrak, Via passengers can book connecting tickets on the following services: * GO Transit - Toronto regional commuter trains * Train de Charlevoix - summer tourist train between Quebec City and the Charlevoix region (no shared station in Quebec City; bus shuttle available) * Union Pearson Express - airport rail link from downtown Toronto to Toronto Pearson International Airport *Maritime Bus - coach operator in Eastern Canada *Robert Q Airbus - transportation to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport and Detroit Metro Airport to several locations in Southern Ontario *BC Ferries Connector - offers service between downtown Vancouver and downtown Victoria *R√©seau de Transports de la Capitale - Public transit in the Qu√©bec City area. *Red Arrow - coach operator in Alberta *Ontario Coachway - provides transportation to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport *R√©G√éM - public transit in Gasp√©sie-Les √éles Via also has connection agreements with several local and intercity bus operators, car-sharing services, and airlines. Passengers who are flying with these airlines can combine their air and rail trips under the same record locator: * AeroMexico * Air North * Air Transat * Cathay Pacific * First Air * Hainan Airlines * LOT Polish Airlines * Qatar Airways * Royal Jordanian Rolling stock Via owns 73 locomotives and 501 passenger cars. Examples include the GMD F40PH-2 diesel locomotive and the famed \\"Park\\"-class sleeper-dome-lounge cars found on the rear of the Canadian and Jasper‚ÄìPrince Rupert train. Carbon emissions In 2010, Via's carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 0.117 kg.Email from Bruno Riendeau, Senior Advisor, Environment, to Alaric Hall, October 20, 2011.

Accidents and incidents * The most serious Via accident to date occurred on 8 February 1986, when a Via train collided with a CN freight train near Hinton, Alberta, killing 23 people and injuring 71. * On 20 November 1994, at approximately 18:20 eastern standard time, Via train No. 66 travelling eastward at approximately 96 mph, struck a piece of rail intentionally placed on the track at Mile 242.07 of the CN North America Kingston Subdivision, in Brighton, Ontario. A fire erupted and the trailing portion of the locomotive and the first two passenger cars behind the locomotive became engulfed in flames. Forty-six of the 385 passengers were injured, most while exiting the train in life-threatening conditions. 2 local residents were charged and convicted after an investigation by the local police. * On 3 September 1997, the Canadian (train No. 2) from Vancouver to Toronto, travelling eastward at 67 mph, derailed at Mile 7.5 of the CN Wainwright Subdivision, near Biggar, Saskatchewan. Thirteen of nineteen cars and the two locomotives derailed. Seventy-nine of the 198 passengers and crew on board were injured, 1 fatally and 13 seriously. Approximately 600 feet of main track was destroyed. The cause was determined to be an axle bearing failure which was detected but erroneously ignored. Via was heavily criticized for a lack of attention to safety. *On 23 April 1999, Via train No. 74 travelling eastward at Mile 46.7 on the CN Chatham Subdivision in Thamesville, Ontario derailed after a switch was left open by a CN worker causing the train to jump the tracks and collide with stationary hoppers on the adjacent track, derailing the locomotive and its four-passenger cars. The two engineers were killed and 77 of the 186 passengers injured, four seriously. Approximately 50 m of the main track and 100 m of the yard track were destroyed. * On 12 April 2001, the Ocean bound for Montr√©al derailed at a manually operated main track switch in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia. A standard CN switch lock used to secure the switch in correct position had been tampered with. The two locomotives and the first two cars continued on the main track, but the following cars took a diverging route onto an industrial track adjacent to the main track. Nine of the cars derailed and a farm supply building, as well as the industrial track were destroyed. Four occupants of the building escaped without injury prior to impact. There were 132 persons on board the train. 22 persons were transported to hospital in either Truro or Halifax. Nine were seriously injured. A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to the charge of mischief endangering life relating to the lock tampering. * On 26 February 2012, Via Train No. 92 en route to Toronto, derailed in Burlington, Ontario, killing all three railroad engineers and injuring 46 (three seriously). The cause of the derailment is attributed to the excessive speed of the train travelling through a switch from track 2 to track 3. *2013 Via Rail Canada terrorism plot: In April 2013, two men inspired by al-Qaeda were charged with plotting to derail a Via train in the Greater Toronto Area. In 2015, both men were convicted of terrorism- related offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.Diana Mehta, Men convicted in Via terror plot handed life sentences, Canadian Press (September 23, 2016). One of the two men was mentally unstable and misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.Richard Warnica, Legal battle over convicted terrorist Chiheb Esseghaier‚Äôs sanity set as lawyers appointed for appeal, National Post (January 13, 2016).Richard Warnica, Would-be terrorist Chiheb Esseghaier is clearly insane, but should that even matter in court?, National Post (August 28, 2015). * On 18 September 2013, a collision occurred between train No. 51 and a double-decker OC Transpo bus that failed to stop at a level crossing in Ottawa, Ontario. Six people were killed and 31 injured (11 critically), all of whom were on the bus. The impact resulted in the train derailing approximately down the track. *On 5 July 2018, a train with 16 passengers and five crew members derailed north of Hudson Bay, SK while travelling from Winnipeg to Churchill. Passengers and crew sustained only minor injuries, but it took several hours for emergency crews to arrive due to the remote location of the incident.

Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theory has been consciously applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. Filmmaker George Lucas acknowledged Campbell's theory in mythology, and its influence on the Star Wars films.Joseph Campbell, The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work, 3rd edition, Phil Cousineau, editor. Novato, California: New World Library, 2003, pp. 186-187. The Joseph Campbell Foundation and New World Library issued a new edition of The Hero with a Thousand Faces in July 2008 as part of the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series of books, audio and video recordings. In 2011, Time placed the book in its list of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since the magazine was founded in 1923. Summary Campbell explores the theory that mythological narratives frequently share a fundamental structure. The similarities of these myths brought Campbell to write his book in which he details the structure of the monomyth. He calls the motif of the archetypal narrative, \\"the hero's adventure\\". In a well-known quote from the introduction to The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell summarizes the monomyth: In laying out the monomyth, Campbell describes a number of stages or steps along this journey. \\"The hero's adventure\\" begins in the ordinary world. He must depart from the ordinary world, when he receives a call to adventure. With the help of a mentor, the hero will cross a guarded threshold, leading him to a supernatural world, where familiar laws and order do not apply. There, the hero will embark on a road of trials, where he is tested along the way. The archetypal hero is sometimes assisted by allies. As the hero faces the ordeal, he encounters the greatest challenge of the journey. Upon rising to the challenge, the hero will receive a reward, or boon. Campbell's theory of the monomyth continues with the inclusion of a metaphorical death and resurrection. The hero must then decide to return with this boon to the ordinary world. The hero then faces more trials on the road back. Upon the hero's return, the boon or gift may be used to improve the hero's ordinary world, in what Campbell calls, the application of the boon. While many myths do seem to follow the outline of Campbell's monomyth, there is some variance in the inclusion and sequence of some of the stages. Still, there is an abundance of literature and folklore that follows the motif of the archetypal narrative, paralleling the more general steps of \\"Departure\\" (sometimes called Separation), \\"Initiation\\", and \\"Return\\". \\"Departure\\" deals with the hero venturing forth on the quest, including the call to adventure. \\"Initiation\\" refers to the hero's adventures that will test him along the way. The last part of the monomyth is the \\"Return\\", which follows the hero's journey home. Campbell studied religious, spiritual, mythological and literary classics including the stories of Osiris, Prometheus, the Buddha, Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus. The book cites the similarities of the stories, and references them as he breaks down the structure of the monomyth. The book includes a discussion of \\"the hero's journey\\" by using the Freudian concepts popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Campbell's theory incorporates a mixture of Jungian archetypes, unconscious forces, and Arnold van Gennep's structuring of rites of passage rituals to provide some illumination.Since the late 1960s, with the introduction of post-structuralism, theories such as the monomyth (to the extent they are based in structuralism) have lost ground in the academic world. Nonetheless, the resonance of this theory and of Campbell's schema remains; every year, The Hero with a Thousand Faces is used as a text-book in thousands of university courses worldwide. Source: Joseph Campbell Foundation website. \\"The hero's journey\\" continues to influence artists and intellectuals in contemporary arts and culture, suggesting a basic usefulness for Campbell's insights beyond mid-20th century forms of analysis. Background Campbell used the work of early-20th-century theorists to develop his model of the hero (see also structuralism), including Freud (particularly the Oedipus complex), Carl Jung (archetypal figures and the collective unconscious), and Arnold Van Gennep. Van Gennep contributed the concept of there being three stages of The Rites of Passage. Campbell translated this into Separation, Initiation and Return. He also looked to the work of psychologist Otto Rank and ethnographers James George Frazer and Franz Boas. Campbell was a noted scholar of James Joyce, having co-authored A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake with Henry Morton Robinson. Campbell borrowed the term monomyth from Joyce's Finnegans Wake. In addition, Joyce's Ulysses was also highly influential in the structuring of the archetypal motif. =Publishing history= Cover of reprints of the book, featuring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker The book was originally published by the Bollingen Foundation through Pantheon Press as the seventeenth title in the Bollingen Series. This series was taken over by Princeton University Press, who published the book through 2006. Originally issued in 1949 and revised by Campbell in 1968, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has been reprinted a number of times. Reprints issued after the release of Star Wars in 1977 used the image of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover. Princeton University Press issued a commemorative printing of the second edition in 2004 on the occasion of the joint centennial of Campbell's birth and the Press's founding with an added foreword by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s. A third edition, compiled by the Joseph Campbell Foundation and published by New World Library, was released as the twelfth title in the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series in July 2008. The Hero with a Thousand Faces has been translated into over twenty languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Turkish, Dutch, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Romanian, Czech, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Hebrew, and has sold well over a million copies worldwide.The Complete Works of Joseph Campbell data base on the Joseph Campbell Foundation website, accessed July 2, 2010. Artists influenced by the work In Pathways to Bliss: Mythology and Personal Transformation, a book drawn from Campbell's late lectures and workshops, he says about artists and the monomyth: =Influences on artists= The Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced a number of artists, filmmakers, musicians, producers and poets. Some of these figures include Bob Dylan, George Lucas, Mark Burnett and Jim Morrison. Additionally, Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead had long noted Campbell's influence and participated in a seminar with Campbell in 1986, entitled \\"From Ritual to Rapture\\".Stephen Larsen and Robin Larsen, Joseph Campbell: A Fire in the Mind, p. 540. In film Stanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to the book during the writing of 2001: A Space Odyssey. George Lucas' deliberate use of Campbell's theory of the monomyth in the making of the Star Wars movies is well documented. On the DVD release of the famous colloquy between Campbell and Bill Moyers, filmed at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and broadcast in 1988 on PBS as The Power of Myth, Campbell and Moyers discussed Lucas's use of The Hero with a Thousand Faces in making his films. Lucas himself discussed how Campbell's work affected his approach to storytelling and film-making.Joseph Campbell, The Hero's Journey, loc. cit. In games Jenova Chen, lead designer at thatgamecompany, also cites The Hero's Journey as the primary inspiration for the PlayStation 3 game Journey (2012).Kevin O'Hannessian, GAME DESIGNER JENOVA CHEN ON THE ART BEHIND HIS \\"JOURNEY\\"; CoCreate Magazine Mark Rosewater, head designer of the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, cites The Hero's Journey as a major inspiration for \\"The Weatherlight Saga\\", an epic story arc that went from 1997 to 2001, and spanned multiple card sets, comic books, and novels. In literature Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer and writer, wrote a memo for Disney Studios on the use of The Hero with a Thousand Faces as a guide for scriptwriters; this memo influenced the creation of such films as Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and Beauty and the Beast (1991). Vogler later expanded the memo and published it as the book The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers, which became the inspiration for a number of successful Hollywood films and is believed to have been used in the development of the Matrix series. Novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work, and specifically to the concept of the monomyth.Bridgman, Joan (August 2000). \\"Richard Adams at Eighty\\". The Contemporary Review (The Contemporary Review Company Limited) 277.1615: 108. . In his best known work, Watership Down, Adams uses extracts from The Hero with a Thousand Faces as chapter epigrams.Richard Adams, Watership Down. Scribner, 2005, p. 225. Author Neil Gaiman, whose work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure,See Stephen Rauch, Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and Joseph Campbell: In Search of the Modern Myth, Wildside Press, 2003 says that he started The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it: > \\"I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and > found myself thinking if this is true‚ÄîI don't want to know. I really would > rather not know this stuff. I‚Äôd rather do it because it's true and because I > accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be > told what the pattern is.\\" Many scholars and reviewers have noted how closely J. K. Rowling's popular Harry Potter books hewed to the monomyth schema.Sharon Black, \\"The Magic of Harry Potter: Symbols and Heroes of Fantasy,\\" Children‚Äòs Literature in Education, Springer Netherlands, Volume 34, Number 3 / September, 2003, pp. 237‚Äì247, ; Patrick Shannon, \\"Harry Potter as Classic Myth\\"; Deborah De Rosa, \\"Wizardly Challenges to, and Affirmations of the Initiation Paradigm in Harry Potter,\\" Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter, Elizabeth Heileman, ed. Routledge, 2002, pp 163‚Äì183‚Äîthere are numerous similar references. In television Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV show Community, has stated that he has used the monomyth as inspiration for his work.A Sense of Community: Essays on the Television Series and Its Fandom. (McFarland, 2014) p. 24. The sixth and final season of Lost recognizes Campbell's theories on the hero. During one of the bonus features, the makers of the series discuss the journey of the main characters and how each is a hero in their own way. Before each little segment of this particular feature, they quote Campbell and then expound on that particular quote by discussing the various characters.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Limerick East constituency from 1954 to 1968. He played rugby for Connacht, Ulster and Munster. Early and private life O'Malley was born in Limerick in 1921. Born into a wealthy middle-class family, he was educated by the Jesuits at Crescent College and later at Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare. He later studied at University College Galway (UCG), where he was conferred with a degree in engineering in 1943. He then returned to Limerick, where he worked as an engineer before becoming involved in politics. O'Malley married Dr. Hilda Moriarty (1922‚Äì1991) in August 1947. The couple had two children: the actor Daragh O'Malley, and Suzanne, a fashion designer. O'Malley's wife is famous as Patrick Kavanagh's ideal love in the poem \\"On Raglan Road\\".https://blog.nli.ie/index.php/2012/02/14/yours-fondly- patrick/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/raglan-road-turn- off-1.1347732 Early political career O'Malley was born into a highly politicised family who supported Cumann na nGaedheal until a falling-out with the party in the early 1930s. He first became involved in local politics as a member of Limerick Corporation. He became Mayor of Limerick in 1961, the third O'Malley brother to hold the office (Desmond O'Malley was mayor from 1941 to 1943, and Michael O'Malley from 1948 to 1949). Donogh O'Malley was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il TD for Limerick East at the 1954 general election; Fianna F√°il was not returned to government on that occasion. He spent the rest of the decade on the backbenches; however, his party was returned to power in 1957. Two years later, the modernising process began when Se√°n Lemass took over from √âamon de Valera as Taoiseach. Lemass introduced younger cabinet ministers, as the old guard who had served the party since its foundation in 1926 began to retire. In 1961, O'Malley joined the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in the most important and prestigious ministry. O'Malley was part of a new, brasher style of politician that emerged in the 1960s. Cabinet career Following Fianna F√°il's retention of power in the 1965 general election, O'Malley joined the cabinet as Minister for Health. He spent just over a year in this position before he was appointed Minister for Education, a position in which he displayed renowned dynamism. Having succeeded another dynamic young minister, Patrick Hillery, O'Malley acted swiftly to introduce the recommendations of an official report on education. Shortly after he was appointed, he announced that from 1969 all education up to Intermediate Certificate level would be free, and free buses would bring students in rural areas to their nearest school. O'Malley seems to have made this decision himself without consulting other ministers; however, he did discuss it with Lemass. Jack Lynch‚Äîwho as Minister for Finance had to find the money to pay for this‚Äîwas not consulted and was dismayed at the announcement. O'Malley's proposals were hugely popular with the public, and it was impossible for the government to go back on his word. As Minister for Education, O'Malley extended the school transport scheme and commissioned the building of new non-denominational comprehensive and community schools in areas where they were needed. He introduced Regional Technical Colleges (RTCs), now called Institutes of Technology, in areas where there was no third level college. The best example of this policy is the University of Limerick, originally an Institute of Higher Education, where O'Malley is credited with taking the steps to ensure that it became a university. His plan to merge Trinity College, Dublin and University College Dublin aroused huge controversy, and was not successful, despite being supported by his cabinet colleague Brian Lenihan. Access to third-level education was also extended, the old scholarship system being replaced by a system of means-tested grants that gave easier access to students without well-off parents.http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/5169/1/Sean_O_Dubhlaing_20140708083500.pdf It is accepted in Ireland that O'Malley's extension of education, changing Ireland from a land where the majority were schooled only to the age of 14 to a country with universal secondary school education, led to the Celtic Tiger boom of the 1990s-2000shttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/bruton-attributes- economic-boom-to-o-malley-1.202465 when it was followed for some years by an extension of free education to primary degree level in university, a scheme that was launched in 1996 by the Labour Party and axed in 2009 by Fianna Fail's Batt O'Keeffe.http://www.independent.ie/life/family/learning/okeeffe- to-end-free-thirdlevel-education-26522433.html Death O'Malley's reforms made him one of the most popular members of the government; he was affectionately known as 'the School Man' for his work in education. His sudden death in Limerick on 10 March 1968, before his vision for the education system was completed, came as a shock to the public. He was buried with a full Irish state funeral. Following his death, his widow, Dr. Hilda O'Malley, did not run in the subsequent by-election for the seat he had left vacant. It was won narrowly by their nephew Desmond O'Malley. Hilda sought the Fianna F√°il nomination for the 1969 general election, but Fianna F√°il gave the party nomination to Desmond, as the sitting TD. Hilda O'Malley ran as an Independent candidate in that election; after what proved a bitter campaign against her nephew, she failed to get the fourth seat in Limerick East by just 200 votes.

J. and L. P. Ritzman. 2005. Operations Management: Processes and Value Chains. Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River. It may include people from finance, marketing, operations, and human resources departments. Typically, it includes employees from all levels of an organization. Members may also come from outside an organization (in particular, from suppliers, key customers, or consultants). Cross- functional teams often function as self-directed teams assigned to a specific task which calls for the input and expertise of numerous departments. Assigning a task to a team composed of multi-disciplinary individuals increases the level of creativity and . Each member offers an alternative perspective to the problem and potential solution to the task. In business today, innovation is a leading competitive advantage and cross-functional teams promote innovation through a creative collaboration process. Members of a cross-functional team must be well versed in multi-tasking as they are simultaneously responsible for their cross-functional team duties as well as their normal day-to-day work tasks. Some researchers have viewed cross- functional interactions as cooperative or competitive in nature, while others have argued that organization‚Äôs functional areas are often forced to compete and cooperate simultaneously with one another (‚Äúcoopetition‚Äù) and it is critical to understand how these complex relationships interplay and affect firm performance. Decision making within a team may depend on consensus, but often is led by a manager/coach/team leader. Leadership can be a significant challenge with cross-functional teams. Leaders are charged with the task of directing team members of various disciplines. They must transform different variations of input into one cohesive final output. Cross-functional teams can be likened to the board of directors of a company. A group of individuals of various backgrounds and disciplines are assembled to collaborate in an efficient manner in order to better the organization or solve a problem. Some organizations are built around cross-functional workflows by having reporting lines to multiple managers. This type of management is called matrix management, and such organizations are often called matrix organizations.  Effects  The growth of self-directed cross-functional teams has influenced decision-making processes and organizational structures. Although management theory likes to propound that every type of organizational structure needs to make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions, new procedures have started to emerge that work best with teams.Parcon, P. (2006) Develop Your Team Building Skills, Lotus Press, Jan 1, 2006 =Less unidirectional= Up until recently, decision making flowed in one direction. Overall corporate- level objectives drove strategic business unit (SBU) objectives, and these in turn, drove functional level objectives. Today, organizations have flatter structures, companies diversify less, and functional departments have started to become less well-defined. The rise of self-directed teams reflects these trends. Intra-team dynamics tend to become multi-directional rather than hierarchical. Interactive processes encourage consensus within teams. Also the directives given to the team tend to become more general and less prescribed. =Greater scope of information= Cross-functional teams require a wide range of information to reach their decisions. They need to draw on information from all parts of an organization‚Äôs information base. This includes information from all functional departments. System integration becomes important because it makes all information accessible through a single interface. An inherent benefit of a cross-functional team is the breadth of knowledge brought to the group by each member. Each team member is a representative of a department and therefore can leverage their familiarity with accessing and providing knowledge of that department for the team. This increases the efficiency of a cross-functional team by reducing time spent gathering information. =Greater depth of information= Cross-functional teams require information from all levels of management. The teams may have their origins in the perceived need to make primarily strategic decisions, tactical decisions, or operational decisions, but they will require all three types of information. Almost all self-directed teams will need information traditionally used in strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. For example, new product development traditionally ranks as a tactical procedure. It gets strategic direction from top management, and uses operational departments like engineering and marketing to perform its task. But a new product development team would consist of people from the operational departments and often someone from top management. In many cases, the team would make unstructured strategic decisions‚Äîsuch as what markets to compete in, what new production technologies to invest in, and what return on investment to require; tactical decisions like whether to build a prototype, whether to concept-test, whether to test- market, and how much to produce; and structured operational decisions like production scheduling, inventory purchases, and media flightings. In other cases, the team would confine itself to tactical and operational decisions. In either case it would need information associated with all three levels. =Greater range of users= Cross-functional teams consist of people from different parts of an organization. Information must be made understandable to all users. Not only engineers use technical data, and not only accountants use financial data, and not only human resources personnel use HR data. Modern organizations lack middle managers to combine, sort, and prioritize the data. Technical, financial, marketing, and all other types of information must come in a form that all members of a cross-functional team can understand. This involves reducing the amount of specialized jargon, sorting information based on importance, hiding complex statistical procedures from the users, giving interpretations of results, and providing clear explanations of difficult. Data visualization systems can present complex results in an intuitive manner. =Less goal dominated= Since the publication of Peter Drucker‚Äôs views on management by objectives, business decision making has become more goal- oriented. Managers have come to view decision-making generally, and strategic thinking in particular, as a multi-stage process that starts with an assessment of the current situation, defining objectives, then determining how to reach these objectives. Management by objectives took this basic scheme and applied it to virtually all significant decisions. Today many firms have started to opt for a less structured, more interactive approach. One way of implementing this involves using self-directed cross-functional teams.Leybourn, E. (2013). Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management. London: IT Governance Publishing: 71‚Äì79. Proponents hope that these teams will develop strategies that will re-define industries and create new ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù. They think that incremental improvements do not suffice. Cross-functional teams, using unstructured techniques and searching for revolutionary competitive advantages, allegedly require information systems featuring increased interactivity, more flexibility, and the capability of dealing with fuzzy logic. Artificial intelligence may one day be useful in this aspect.  Collaboration In Cross-functional teams  Many teams in large organizations face challenges around creating a collaborative atmosphere when dealing with cross-functional dependencies and peers from other functions. The structure of the organizations in general do not support cross-functional collaboration among the teams. It becomes important for the organizations to build a culture among its employees, a sense of entitlement with each of the stakeholders to push them to go extra mile and collaborate with other teams to achieve company goals. This is critical to proactive collaboration, beyond just at a time of crisis.

Early life Brugha was born in Dublin, of mixed Roman Catholic and Protestant parentage. He was the tenth child in a family of fourteen. His father, Thomas, was a cabinet maker and antique dealer who had been disinherited by his family for marrying an Irish Catholic, Maryanne Flynn. Colmkille Schools was the primary school of Brugha which he attended up until 1888 when he was admitted to Belvedere College. He had intended to study medicine but this did not come to fruition after his father's business failed in 1890. Brugha was seen as an austere figure, not very different from √âamon de Valera, and was known not to smoke cigarettes, swear or drink alcohol. Political activity In 1899, Brugha joined the Gaelic League, and he subsequently changed his name from Charles Burgess to Cathal Brugha. He met his future wife, Kathleen Kingston, at an Irish class in Birr, County Offaly, and they married in 1912. They had six children, five girls and one boy. Brugha became actively involved in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB); in 1913, he became a lieutenant in the Irish Volunteers. He led a group of twenty Volunteers to receive the arms smuggled into Ireland in the Howth gun-running of 1914. He was second-in-command at the South Dublin Union under Commandant √âamonn Ceannt in the Easter Rising of 1916. On the Thursday of Easter Week, being badly wounded, he was unable to leave when the retreat was ordered. Brugha, weak from loss of blood, continued to fire upon the enemy, and was found by Eamonn Ceannt singing \\"God Save Ireland\\" with his pistol still in his hands. He was initially not considered likely to survive. He recovered over the next year, but was left with a permanent limp. Brugha was elected Ceann Comhairle of D√°il √âireann at its first meeting on 21 January 1919, and he read out the Declaration of Independence in Irish, which ratified \\"the establishment of the Irish Republic\\". On the following day, 22 January, he was appointed president of the ministry pro tempore. He retained this position until 1 April 1919, when √âamon de Valera took his place.  Militant republicanism  =War of Independence= Cathal Brugha commemorative plaque in O'Connell Street, Dublin, at the north-east corner of the junction with Cathedral Street. (Bullet-marked stonework included as part of memorial) He proposed a Republican constitution at the 1917 Sinn F√©in convention, which was unanimously accepted. In October 1917, he became Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army and held that post until March 1919. He was elected as a Sinn F√©in MP for the County Waterford constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F√©in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D√°il √âireann. Owing to the absence of √âamon de Valera and Arthur Griffith, Brugha presided over the first meeting of D√°il √âireann on 21 January 1919. He had differences with Michael Collins, who, although nominally only the IRA's Director of Intelligence, had far more influence in the organisation as a result of his position as a high-ranking member of the IRB, an organisation that Brugha saw as undermining the power of the D√°il and especially the Ministry for Defence. Brugha opposed the oath of allegiance required for membership of the IRB; in 1919, his proposition that all Volunteers should swear allegiance to the Irish Republic and the D√°il was adopted. At a top-level IRA meeting in August 1920, Brugha argued against ambushes of Crown forces unless there was first a call to surrender, but it was dismissed as unrealistic by the brigade commanders present. Brugha also had the idea of moving the front line of the war to England, but was opposed by Collins. =Civil War= Cathal Brugha's grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin On 7 January 1922, Brugha voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty. During the Treaty Debates, he pointed out that Collins had only a middling rank in the Department for Defence, which supervised the IRA, even though Griffith hailed him as 'the man who had won the war'. It has been argued that, by turning the issue into a vote on Collins' popularity, Brugha swung the majority against his own side. Frank O'Connor, in his biography of Collins, states that two delegates who had intended to vote against the Treaty changed sides in sympathy with Collins. Brugha left the D√°il, and was replaced as Minister for Defence by Richard Mulcahy. In the months between the Treaty debates and the outbreak of Civil War, Brugha attempted to dissuade his fellow anti-treaty army leaders including Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows and Joe McKelvey from taking up arms against the Free State. When the IRA occupied the Four Courts, he and Oscar Traynor called on them to abandon their position. When they refused, Traynor ordered the occupation of the area around O'Connell Street in the hope of easing the pressure on the Four Courts and of forcing the Free State to negotiate. On 28 June 1922, Brugha was appointed commandant of the forces in O'Connell Street. The outbreak of the Irish Civil War ensued in the first week of July when Free State forces commenced shelling of the anti-treaty positions. Most of the anti-Treaty fighters under Oscar Traynor escaped from O'Connell Street when the buildings they were holding caught fire, leaving Brugha in command of a small rearguard. On 5 July, he ordered his men to surrender, but refused to do so himself. He then approached the Free State troops, brandishing a revolver. He sustained a bullet wound to the leg which 'severed a major artery causing him to bleed to death'. He died on 7 July 1922, eleven days before his 48th birthday. He had been re-elected as an anti-Treaty TD at the 1922 general election but died before the D√°il assembled. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. His wife Caitl√≠n Brugha served as a Sinn F√©in TD from 1923 to 1927. His son Ruair√≠ Brugha later became a politician, firstly supporting Clann na Poblachta and later Fianna F√°il, and was elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1973 general election. Ruair√≠ married M√°ire MacSwiney, the daughter of Terence MacSwiney, the Republican Lord Mayor of Cork who had died on hunger strike in 1920. Legacy and commemoration Cathal Brugha Street and Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin and Cathal Brugha Street in Waterford are named after him. As of 2016, he is survived by his grandson Cathal MacSwiney Brugha and his great-grandson, Air Corps lieutenant Gear√≥id √ì Briain.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/1916-centenary- commemoration-draws-huge-crowds-to-capital-as-thousands-join-dignitaries-for- historic-ceremony-389751.htmlhttp://www.independent.ie/irish-news/1916/plaque- unveiled-to-commemorate-sacrifice-of-easter-week-34696975.html His wife, Caitl√≠n Brugha, survived him, along with their five daughters and his son, Ruair√≠ Brugha.

Examples of this are modern communication technology and the exchange of information amongst animals. By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in the current state of modernity. A symbol is anything one says or does to describe something, and that something can have an array of many meanings. Once the symbols are learned by a particular group, that symbol stays intact with the object. Symbolic communication includes gestures, body language and facial expressions, as well as vocal moans that can indicate what an individual wants without having to speak. Research argues that about 55% of all communication stems from nonverbal language. Symbolic communication ranges from sign language to braille to tactile communication skills.  Models of Communication  Shannon and Weaver model of communication The Shannon-Weaver Model of communication depicts the most basic communication between two individuals. In this linear process, the sender (source) transmits a message or signal to the receiver, which ultimately will end up going to its destination. The presence of noise within this model arises from disturbances that occur in everyday life. This can be the environment the individuals are in, the people around the individuals or different factors that affect how or if the message is received. The Shannon and Weaver model sets a precedent for symbolic communication, using semantics to create a basis for language. With semantics in play, researchers can understand symbols not only in their own environment, but other symbolic communication strategies as well. Del Hawkins, a doctoral student from the University of Texas, proposed a model of communication that depicts how symbols, if responded to by an individual, can be used as a conversation. The determinants of this process are the source and the recipient, respectively. The four processes that the source performs in this model are sensing, conceiving, encoding, and transmitting. In response to these, the receiver receives, decodes, and internalizes the information. During this process, the source and receiver take turns communicating, thus letting the model flow cyclically. (See Organizational Theory) Once a symbol is known in a society, it is habitual for an individual to respond to it exactly like how they would previously. If a symbol is given that is not known in one's own society, the response will take longer. This is because the individual does not know what the symbol actually means to the source. Because the symbol may have a different meaning to the source and receiver, the individual receiving the information may take longer to process it because they need to figure out what the symbol may mean. They may use context clues or existing knowledge to help decode specific messages.  Symbolic communication in humans  Symbolic communication in humans can be defined as the rule-governed use of a system of arbitrary symbols whose definition and usage are agreed upon by the community of users. Symbols are considered the signifier that represents meaning (the signified). Not only auditory speech, words, and characters in printed visual forms, physical objects, fashion and clothing, human individuals, and events can be classified as symbols. Any entity, natural or social, physical or mental, tangible or intangible, can be a symbol as long as they can be employed to represent something else. = Historical development of symbolic communication = The origin of symbolic communication remains a controversial open problem, obscured by the lack of a fossil record. However, it has been speculated that 1.9 million years ago, Homo erectus began the use of pantomime to communicate which allowed our ancestors to transmit information and experiences. The transition from indexical to symbolic communication is therefore a key evolutionary change because it may signal the origin of language and symbolic thought. A study conducted in the 1980s by Giacomo Rizzolatti on macaque monkeys discovered a class of neurons later known as the mirror neurons which are activated in response to different actions whether the actions are carried out by ourselves or others. It is one of the neural bases to of connecting to others. These mirror neurons are also known to be activated when ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù representations of actions such as mime, speech and reading are experienced. This allowed our ancestral primates to learn and transmit basic forms of symbolic representations to communicate. Skills such as hunting, and crafting could then be taught mimetically. The use of pantomimes also allowed them to describe the past, present and future allowing them to reenact events outside of their immediate context. Over time, the amount and complexity of pantomimes evolved, creating a sufficiently mimetic language which allowed the Homo erectus to create a culture which is similar to that of modern humans. Written communication first emerged through the use of pictograms which slowly developed standardized and simplified forms. Shared writing systems were then developed leading to adaptable alphabets. = Modern symbolic communication = The vast majority of human communication is symbolic, i.e. there is some degree of arbitrariness between the concept and how it is communicated. Both verbal and nonverbal symbolic communication communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign.  Verbal symbolic communication  Verbal communication refers to communication that makes use of words, both written and spoken. Saussure introduced the notion of there being no inherent relation between the use of cow in English and vache in French to signify the same mental concept of a bovine grass feeder. The arbitrary link between the word, both written and spoken, makes this communication symbolic in nature, as opposed to indexical.  Nonverbal symbolic communication  Nonverbal symbolic communication uses learned, socially shared signal systems. As with verbal symbolic communication, the relation between the sign and the signified concept is arbitrary. Unlike verbal symbolic communication, however, nonverbal symbolic communication does not make use of words. Instead, icons, indices or symbols may be used. Nonverbal symbolic communication is not to be confused with nonverbal communication (NVC), which is a broader category that includes nonsymbolic communication as well as symbolic.  Nonverbal languages  While nonverbal communication is nonlinguistic and does not make use of words, there are certain systems designed for the disabled which, while not using any words, do have their own grammar and are considered linguistic forms of communication. = Tactile writing system = Braille is a form of tactile writing system. It consists of raised dots of which vary in number and arrangement to represent the letters of the alphabet, punctuation and letter groupings. Braille is read from left to right, with both hands. It allows people who are blind to visualize text through touch. = Sign language = For people who have hearing difficulties, sign language is sometimes employed to communicate. Sign language makes use of a combination of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body postures. Similar to speech, it has its own grammar and linguistic structure and may vary from each deaf community around the world. = Paralanguage = Paralanguage is a component of meta-communication that may modify meaning, give nuanced meaning, or convey emotion, by using techniques such as prosody, pitch, volume, intonation, etc. Paralinguistic information, because it is phenomenal, belongs to the external speech signal (Ferdinand de Saussure's parole) but not to the arbitrary conventional code of language (Saussure's langue). = Paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs) = This is a recent development that includes textual and online actions that seem to mirror the functions of paralanguage. Likes and Favorites are among the actions considered PDAs, as they contribute to feelings of social support even without the implicit meaning associated with them. This is also sometimes referred to as textual paralanguage (TPL). = Challenges to communication =  Symbolic communication in children  Storybook telling is one of the most influential contexts to help children develop their language. Children nowadays have the technology to listen and touch pictures on books specialized for children using AACYoung children also use symbolic communication as a means to reference objects or understand other people around them. By the time children are around one year of age, they start to understand the basis of language. Although language and speech start in children around age 2, children can communicate with their parents using perceived symbols they have picked up on. For children who are slower to grasp verbal communication skills, parents can use Augmented and Alternative Communication skills to help foster their child's symbols and help them to understand verbal communication. Children who have delayed speech or other mental illnesses cannot grasp the concept of verbal communication, so they turn to symbol communication. These children may already understand basic symbols like head-nodding for \\"yes\\" or head shaking for \\"no\\" from watching their parents or others around them. Children who have a hard time speaking cannot demonstrate their literacy skills confluent with other children their age. Parents who take special care in helping their child use by using symbolic communication at first see a huge growth in their speech and communication skills.  Language and communication disorders  One of the functions of symbolic communication is in the field of communication disorders. It is often used to help facilitate communication between people who have difficulty doing so. There are picture communication systems where often the case that is used with children with little to no speech, tactile writing system also known as braille for the visually impaired and also sign language for the deaf. Nonsymbolic communication is also used for some people with language and communication disorders, and is often used in the case of people with little to no speech. One of these treatments is PECS, which uses pictures to communicate meaning. The end goal is for the person to be able to communicate with others functionally.  Intercultural communication  In intercultural communication, problems with symbolic communication may start to arise. Since symbolic communication involves a shared message between a speaker and a listener, words which Items that are seen as sterile and inoffensive in one culture can be polemic or offensive in other cultures. Problems in intercultural communication may arise when people do not respect each other's cultures in their communication. Understanding what may cause offense is a key to international or even domestic travel or diplomacy when interacting with people not of one's immediate cultural settings. In verbal communication, language barriers sometime exist. Speakers of different languages will be almost completely unable to communicate with each other unless they share some commonalities. This is because the sounds speakers attach symbols to are usually very different from sounds with similar symbols in other languages. As such, people often struggle to communicate ideas between different cultures. The opposite, similar sounds with differing symbols, can also cause problems. What might be a normal word in one culture might be a taboo word in another culture. To avoid such problems, people will often use euphemisms in place of taboo words. Paralinguistic cues such as gestures, intonation and facial expressions can aid in cross-cultural communication as they tend to be more similar to each other than words are. There are, however, some gestures can also sometimes be misunderstood across different cultures. For instance, the thumbs-up gesture which sees frequent usage in many countries and is understood as good, in other countries such as Greece or the Middle East, this gesture is a negative symbol and making such a gesture can be considered very rude. Symbols themselves which represent ideas can hold different meanings to different communities. The first example to come to mind would be the swastika. In Eurasia, some cultures see it as a symbol of divinity and spirituality. However, in the Western world the symbol was flipped and adopted by the German Nazis during World War II and now carries ideas of racism and antisemitism. Wearing this symbol may offend people living there. In 2019, Pichayapa Natha, a member of pop star group BNK48, was slammed for wearing a swastika t-shirt during a rehearsal for a concert.  Animal societies  Communication in animals is usually not symbolic, and the arbitrariness of signs is typically considered the distinguishing factor between human and animal communication. However, research into great ape language has involved teaching chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans to communicate with human beings and with each other using sign language, physical tokens, and lexigrams (Yerkish), which contain some elements of arbitrariness. Some also argue that certain animals are capable of symbolic name usage.

He was the younger brother of Sir Bevil Grenville, who died at Lansdowne in 1643, and grandson of Admiral Sir Richard, killed at Flores in 1591. He began his military career during the 1618 to 1624 Bohemian Revolt, an early phase of the Thirty Years War, then served under the Duke of Buckingham. In 1628, he became MP for Fowey, and married Mary Fitz, a well- connected and wealthy widow; they divorced in 1632, and he was imprisoned for debt. In 1633, he escaped to Europe; from 1634 to 1639, he fought with the Swedes, then the Dutch Republic, before returning home to take part in the Bishops Wars. He served in Ireland from 1642 to 1643, followed by a brief spell with the Parliamentarian army, before defecting to the Royalists in March 1644. He spent the rest of the war in the West Country; arrested for insubordination by Sir Ralph Hopton in early 1646, he was released when the Royalists surrendered in March. His feud with the Earl of Clarendon meant he was barred from the exiled court of Charles II; he died in Ghent on 21 October 1659. Although his negative portrayal in Clarendon's 'History of the Rebellion' was undoubtedly affected by their personal conflict, he was loathed by many on both sides for his brutality and greed. A modern assessment is that while a courageous and competent soldier, capable of inspiring great loyalty, this was offset by a narrow focus on his own self-interest, and violent temper. Biography Richard Grenville was one of two surviving children of Sir Bernard Grenville (1567‚Äì1636), and Elizabeth Bevill (1564‚Äì1636), and grandson of the Elizabethan hero, Sir Richard Grenville. His elder brother was Sir Bevil Grenville. In 1628, he became the fourth husband of Lady Mary Fitz, a wealthy and well connected widow. She was engaged in a legal dispute with her former brother-in-law, the Earl of Suffolk, who refused to return the property she brought to her previous marriage. Despite the courts ruling in her favour, Suffolk refused to accept the judgment, drawing Grenville into an expensive legal dispute. Based on this, Mary insisted on a pre-nuptial agreement, an unusual provision for the period that soon led to conflict. Although they had two children, Richard (ca 1630‚Äì1657?), and Elizabeth (1631-after 1671), the marriage collapsed under the strain of legal costs, exacerbated by Grenville's own extravagance. To secure her own position, Mary allied with her former antagonist, Suffolk, and divorced Grenville. Career =1618 to 1640; the Thirty Years War= Grenville's patron, the Duke of Buckingham, assassinated in August 1628 Little is known of Grenville's early life; it is thought he attended Exeter College, Oxford, like his brother, but he does not appear in their records. Like many younger sons, he adopted a military career; from 1618 to 1623, he served under Horace Vere in the Dutch war with Spain, and the Palatinate campaign. His colleagues included future Civil War generals Sir Ralph Hopton and William Waller; it appears likely all three were members of the English garrison of Frankenthal, which surrendered to the Catholic League in March 1623. On his return to England, Grenville took part in naval expeditions against C√°diz in 1625, Saint-Martin-de-R√© in 1627, and La Rochelle in 1628. All three were expensive disasters, but brought him to the attention of Charles I's favourite, the Duke of Buckingham. With his support, in 1628 Grenville became Member of Parliament for Fowey, Cornwall. Although Buckingham's assassination in August 1628 deprived Grenville of his patron, in November he married Mary Fitz, heir to Fitzford House, in Devon. He used her money to purchase a baronetcy, and fund an extravagant lifestyle; both were strong-willed individuals, and frequently quarrelled. Suffolk came to an agreement with Lady Mary, who divorced Grenville, and the two sued him for slander, demanding ¬£8,000 in damages. Unable to pay, he was imprisoned for debt in March 1632. He escaped in 1633, and fled to the Dutch Republic, where he studied mathematics at Leiden University, a subject popular with professional soldiers, due to its applications in siege warfare. Over the next five years, he served with the Swedish army in Germany, then the Dutch Scots Brigade, which was commanded by his distant relative, the Earl of Leicester. In 1639, he returned to England to join the Royal army assembled for the Bishops Wars; in return, Charles voided his 1632 conviction. =1640 to 1646; the Civil War= In February 1642, Grenville was part of the army sent to suppress the Irish Rebellion, where he gained a reputation as a competent, but ruthless leader, and was appointed governor of Trim, County Meath. As a result, he missed the early stages of the First English Civil War, which began in August 1642. In June 1643, the rebels agreed a truce with Ormond, leader of the Irish Royalists, formally confirmed in September when both sides signed a Cessation of Arms. The truce released Royalist troops for use in England, including Grenville. One suggestion is the death of his elder brother at Lansdowne in July provided an opportunity to assume leadership of the Royalist movement in Cornwall, which was intensely local. On landing in Liverpool in August, he was arrested by Parliamentarian troops, and sent to London. The Irish regiments had not been paid for over a year, and Parliament promised to fund the arrears of any soldier who joined them. In return for swearing loyalty, Grenville received his wages, and was appointed Lieutenant-General of Horse in the Army of the South Eastern Association, led by his former colleague, William Waller. However, in March 1644, he defected to the Royalists, who put him in charge of the siege of Plymouth; he also participated in the victory at Lostwithiel in September. As in Ireland, Grenville soon gained a reputation for brutality, especially his treatment of Parliamentarian prisoners at Lydford and Tavistock, while seizing any opportunity for self-enrichment. However, he also insisted on paying his troops on time; unlike Hopton and others, he did not allow them to take 'free quarter', and prevented plundering. Ruins of the castle on St Michael's Mount, where Grenville was imprisoned in January 1646 As the war turned against the Royalists, internal conflict increased; Grenville refused orders from Prince Rupert to support an attack on Taunton, then quarrelled with Lord Goring, commander of the Western Army. In July, he resigned his command; when he did so, most of the Cornish levies also deserted, and refused pleas from Goring to support his resistance to the advancing New Model Army. By the end of 1645, the Royalists in the West Country were close to defeat, and Grenville proposed setting up an autonomous Cornwall, under the Prince of Wales, and negotiating a truce with Parliament. He positioned local troops along the River Tamar, which formed the boundary between Cornwall and Devon, and issued instructions to keep \\"all foreign troops out of Cornwall\\", including Royalist remnants under Lord Goring. Such a strategy was unacceptable to his superiors, and displayed his characteristic inability to appreciate the wider political perspective. When Hopton replaced Goring as commander in the West, Grenville refused to serve under him; in January 1646, he was arrested for insubordination and imprisoned on St Michael's Mount. After Hopton surrendered in March, he was released, and allowed to escape into exile, since he was likely to be executed if he fell into Parliamentarian hands. =1646 to 1659; Exile and death= The Earl of Clarendon; Grenville's feud led to his banishment from the exile Court He joined the exiled Court in Jersey, and was one of those excluded by Parliament from pardon. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II appointed him Lieutenant-General under the Marquess of Hertford for a proposed Western Rising that never took place. In 1653, he became involved in an unsuccessful conspiracy against the Earl of Clarendon, and banished from court. He spent the next few years in Italy and the Netherlands, and made a secret visit to England, apparently in hopes of retrieving his property. In 1654, he published his Single defence against all aspersions of all malignant persons, giving his version of events in the West; in 1736, it appeared in the Works of George Grenville, Lord Lansdowne. It was intended to offset Clarendon's The History of the Rebellion, although the first volume of the 'History' only covered the period to March 1644; the second volume, with details of Grenville's service, was not completed until 1671. At some point in the 1650s, his son Richard died, and in 1657, he was joined in exile by his daughter Elizabeth, who thus became involved in his ongoing legal battle with the Howards. He died on 21 October 1659, and was buried at Ghent, in the Spanish Netherlands; the grave has since disappeared. His nephew John Granville (1628‚Äì1701), was a leading figure in the 1660 Restoration. Like his uncle, he incurred enormous debts in a legal dispute; his heir committed suicide on discovering their extent. Elizabeth was still alive in 1671, when she appears in her mother's will; it is suggested she married a Royalist sea-captain, but details are scarce.

The family settled on a farm in Douro township, near Lakefield, north of Peterborough, where her brother Samuel Strickland (1804‚Äì1867) worked as a surveyor, and where artifacts are housed in a museum. Founded by Samuel, the museum was formerly an Anglican church and overlooks the Otonabee River where Susanna once canoed. It also displays artifacts concerning Samuel, as well as her elder sister and fellow writer Catharine, who married a friend of John Moodie and emigrated to the same area a few weeks before Susanna and John. Moodie continued to write in Canada and her letters and journals contain valuable information about life in the colony. She observed life in what was then the backwoods of Ontario, including native customs, the climate, the wildlife, relations between the Canadian population and recent American settlers, and the strong sense of community and the communal work, known as \\"bees\\" (which she, incidentally, hated). She suffered through the economic depression in 1836, and her husband served in the militia against William Lyon Mackenzie in the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. As a middle-class Englishwoman, Moodie did not particularly enjoy \\"the bush\\", as she called it. In 1840 she and her husband moved to Belleville, which she referred to as \\"the clearings\\". She studied the Family Compact and became sympathetic to the moderate reformers led by Robert Baldwin, while remaining critical of radical reformers such as William Lyon Mackenzie. This caused problems for her husband, who shared her views, but, as sheriff of Belleville, had to work with members and supporters of the Family Compact. In 1852, she published Roughing it in the Bush, detailing her experiences on the farm in the 1830s. In 1853, she published Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush, about her time in Belleville. She remained in Belleville, living with various family members (particularly her son Robert) after her husband's death, and lived to see Canadian Confederation. She died in Toronto, Ontario on 8 April 1885 and is buried in Belleville Cemetery. Her greatest literary success was Roughing it in the Bush. The inspiration for the memoir came from a suggestion by her editor that she write an \\"emigrant's guide\\" for British people looking to move to Canada. Moodie wrote of the trials and tribulations she found as a \\"New Canadian\\", rather than the advantages to be had in the colony. She claimed that her intention was not to discourage immigrants but to prepare people like herself, raised in relative wealth and with no prior experience as farmers, for what life in Canada would be like. Moodie taught her daughter Agnes how to paint flowers and Agnes later illustrated Canadian Wild Flowers, published in 1868. =Recognition= Moodie's books and poetry inspired Margaret Atwood's collection of poetry, The Journals of Susanna Moodie, published in 1970. It was also an important influence on one of Atwood's later novels, Alias Grace, based on an account of murder convict Grace Marks which appeared in Life in the Clearings Versus the Bush. She has also been a source of inspiration for Carol Shields, who published a critical analysis of Moodie's work, Susanna Moodie: Voice and Vision. Additionally, the central character of Shields' novel, Small Ceremonies, is working on a biography of Moodie. Commemorative postage stamp On 8 September 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, \\"The Writers of Canada\\", with a design by Katalina Kovats, featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. Moodie and her sister Catherine Parr Traill were featured on one of the English-Canadian stamps.\\"50th Anniversary of the National Library / Canadian Authors ,\\" Canada Post, Web, 28 Mar 2011.

Lin was the general who commanded the decisive Liaoshen and Pingjin Campaigns, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the People's Liberation Army into Beijing. He crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, decisively defeated the Kuomintang and took control of the coastal provinces in Southeast China. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of He Long and Liu Bocheng. Lin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the civil war ceased in 1949. He led a section of the government's civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China from 1954 onwards, becoming First Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving Vice Chairmen of the Communist Party of China in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and Minister of National Defense from 1959 onwards. To date, Lin is the longest serving Minister of National Defence of the People's Republic of China. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong's cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death. Lin died on September 13, 1971, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident he was aboard crashed in √ñnd√∂rkhaan in Mongolia. The exact events of this \\"Lin Biao incident\\" have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government's official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a botched coup against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin's relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin's death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s, Lin and Mao's wife Jiang Qing (along with the other members of the Gang of Four) have been labeled the two major \\"counter-revolutionary forces\\" of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government for the worst excesses of that period. Revolutionary =Youth= 200px Lin Biao was the son of a prosperous merchant family in Huanggang, Hubei.Leung 69 His name at birth was \\"Lin Yurong\\". Lin's father opened a small handicrafts factory in the mid-late 1910s, but was forced to close the factory due to \\"heavy taxes imposed by local militarists\\". After closing the factory, Lin's father worked as a purser aboard a river steamship. Lin entered primary school in 1917,Lin 164 and moved to Shanghai in 1919 to continue his education.Lazitch and Drachkovitch 265‚Äì267 As a child, Lin was much more interested in participating in student movements than in pursuing his formal education.Lee 170 Lin transferred to Wuchang Gongjin High School () at 15. Lin joined a satellite organization of the Communist Youth League before he graduated high school in 1925. Later in 1925 he participated in the May Thirtieth Movement and enrolled in the newly established Whampoa (Huangpu) Military Academy in Guangzhou. As a young cadet, Lin admired the personality of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), who was then the Principal of the Academy. At Whampoa, Lin also studied under Zhou Enlai, who was eight years older than Lin. Lin had no contact with Zhou after their time in Whampoa, until they met again in Yan'an in the late 1930s.Barnonin and Yu 240 Lin's relationship with Zhou was never especially close, but they rarely opposed each other directly. After graduating from Whampoa in 1926, Lin was assigned to a regiment commanded by Ye Ting. Less than a year after graduating from Whampoa, he was assigned to the Northern Expedition, where he rose from deputy platoon leader to battalion commander within a few months. During this time Lin joined the Communist Party. By 1927 Lin was a colonel. When he was 20 Lin married a girl from the countryside with the family name \\"Ong\\". This marriage was arranged by Lin's parents, and the couple never became close. When Lin left the Kuomintang to become a communist revolutionary, Ong did not accompany Lin, and their marriage effectively ended. =Chinese Civil War= After the Kuomintang-Communist split, Lin's commander, Ye Ting, joined forces with He Long and participated in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927.Leung 70 During the campaign Lin worked as a company commander under a regiment led by Chen Yi.Barnouin and Yu 242 Following the failure of the revolt, Lin escaped to the remote Communist base areas, and joined Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the Jiangxi‚ÄìFujian Soviet in 1928. After joining forces with Mao, Lin became one of Mao's closest supporters. Lin became one of the most senior military field commanders within the Jiangxi Soviet. He commanded the First Army Group, and achieved a degree of power comparable to that of Peng Dehuai, who commanded the Third Army Group. According to Comintern representative Otto Braun, Lin was \\"politically... a blank sheet on which Mao could write as he pleased\\" during this period. After Mao was removed from power in 1932 by his rivals (the 28 Bolsheviks), Lin frequently attended strategic meetings in Mao's name and openly attacked the plans of Mao's enemies.Hu Chi-hsi 253 Within the Jiangxi Soviet, Lin's First Army Group was the best-equipped and arguably most successful force within the Red Army. Lin's First Army became known for its mobility, and for its ability to execute successful flanking maneuvers. Between 1930 and 1933, Lin's forces captured twice the number of prisoners of war and military equipment as the Third and Fifth Army Groups combined. The successes of Lin's forces are due partially to the division of labour within the Red Army: Lin's forces were more offensive and unorthodox than other groups, allowing Lin to capitalize on other Red Army commanders' successes.Hu Chi-hsi 263 During the Communists' defense against Chiang's 1933‚Äì34 Fifth Encirclement Campaign, Lin advocated a strategy of protracted guerilla warfare, and opposed the positional warfare advocated by Braun and his supporters. Lin believed that the best way to destroy enemy soldiers was not to pursue them or defend strategic points, but to weaken the enemy through feints, ambushes, encirclements, and surprise attacks. Lin's views generally conformed with the tactics advocated by Mao.Hu Chi-hsi 257‚Äì260 After Chiang's forces successfully occupied several strategic locations within the Jiangxi Soviet, in 1934, Lin was one of the first Red Army commanders to publicly advocate the abandonment of the Jiangxi Soviet, but he was opposed by most Red Army commanders, especially Braun and Peng Dehuai.Hu Chi-hsi 264 After the Communists finally resolved to abandon their base, later in 1934, Lin continued his position as one of the most successful commanders in the Red Army during the Long March. Under the direction of Mao and Zhou, the Red Army finally arrived at the remote Communist base of Yan'an, Shaanxi, in December 1936. Lin and Peng Dehuai were generally considered the Red Army's best battlefield commanders, and were not rivals during the Long March. Both of them had supported Mao's rise to de facto leadership at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935. Lin may have become privately dissatisfied with Mao's strategy of constant evasion by the end of the Long March, but continued to support Mao publicly.Salisbury 188 The American journalist Edgar Snow met Lin Biao in the Communist base of Shaanxi in 1936,Hu Chi-hsi 267 and wrote about Lin in his book, Red Star Over China. Snow's account focused more on the role of Peng than Lin, evidently having had long conversations with, and devoting two whole chapters to, Peng (more than any individual apart from Mao). But he says of Lin: > Lin Biao did not present the bluff, lusty face of Peng Dehuai. He was ten > years younger, rather slight, oval-faced, dark, handsome. Peng talked with > his men. Lin kept his distance. To many he seemed shy and reserved. There > are no stories reflecting warmth and affection for his men. His fellow Red > Army commanders respected Lin, but when he spoke, it was all business ... > The contrast between Mao's top field commanders could hardly have been more > sharp, but on the Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in > feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from > the rear, and stratagems.

Peng did not > believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish‚Äîand more than > replenish‚Äîany losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of > war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.Salisbury 191‚Äì192 With Mao > Zedong, Lin Biao shared the distinction of being one of the few Red > commanders never wounded.

In 1937, Lin married one of the students there, a girl named Liu Ximin, who had earned the nickname \\"University Flower\\".Lee 170‚Äì171 =Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War (1937‚Äì1945)= Lin Biao with wife Ye Qun and their children In August 1937, Lin was named commander-in-chief of the 115th Division of the Communist 8th Route Army and ordered to aid Yan Xishan's forces in repelling the Japanese invasion of Shanxi. In this capacity, Lin orchestrated the ambush at Pingxingguan in September 1937, which was one of the few battlefield successes for the Chinese in the early period of the Second Sino-Japanese War (known in China as the \\"War of Resistance Against Japan\\"). In 1938, while he was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese soldiers who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him.Lee 171 The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull.Hannam and Lawrence 4 After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back. Recovering from his wounds and ill with tuberculosis, Lin left for Moscow at the end of 1938, where he served as the representative of the Communist Party of China to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. He remained in Moscow until February 1942, working on Comintern affairs and writing for its publication. Lin was accompanied by his wife, Liu Ximin, but their relationship deteriorated in Moscow, and Lin eventually returned to Yan'an without her. While in Moscow, Lin became infatuated with Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, who was studying in Moscow from 1938 to 1946. Before returning to China, in 1942, Lin proposed to Sun and promised to divorce his wife, from whom Lin had become estranged. Sun was not able to accept Lin's proposal, but promised to consider marrying Lin after completing her studies. Lin divorced Liu Ximin after returning to China, and married another woman, Ye Qun, in 1943. The relationship between Sun and Ye was notably bad.Zhang 2 After returning to Yan'an, Lin was involved in troop training and indoctrination assignments. =Liaoshen Campaign= 280px Lin as commander-in-chief of the Manchurian Field Army (~1947-1948) Lin was absent for most of the fighting during World War II, but was elected the sixth- ranking Central Committee member in 1945 based on his earlier battlefield reputation. After the Japanese surrender, the Communists moved large numbers of troops to Manchuria (Northeast China), and Lin Biao relocated to Manchuria to command the new \\"Communist Northeast Military District\\". The Soviets transferred captured Japanese military equipment to the Communists, making Lin's army one of the most well-equipped Communist forces in China. By the time that units from the Kuomintang (Nationalists) were able to arrive in the major cities of Manchuria, Lin's forces were already in firm control of most of the countryside and surrounding areas.Leung 70‚Äì71 By the end of 1945, Lin had 280,000 troops in Manchuria under his command,Barnouin and Yu 103 but according to Kuomintang estimates only 100,000 of these were regular forces with access to adequate equipment. The KMT also estimated that Lin also had access to 100,000 irregular auxiliaries, whose membership was drawn mainly from unemployed factory workers. Lin avoided decisive confrontations throughout 1945, and he was able to preserve the strength of his army despite criticism from his peers in the Party and the PLA.Lew 32‚Äì36 For the sake of bargaining with the Kuomintang in peace negotiations in 1946, Mao ordered Lin to assemble his army to take and defend key cities, which was against the previous strategy of the Red Army. Lin disagreed with this position, but was ordered by Mao to draw the KMT into a decisive battle and \\"not give an inch of land\\" around Siping, Jilin. On April 15, Lin orchestrated an ambush and forced KMT forces there to withdraw with heavy casualties. When the local KMT commander, Du Yuming, launched a counterattack on April 18, Mao ordered the troops there to hold the city indefinitely. The fighting continued until Mao finally allowed Lin to withdraw on May 19, which Lin did immediately, barely saving his army from encirclement and destruction.Lew 36 Du pursued Lin's forces to the south bank of the Songhua River, where they halted due to Du's concerns about his army becoming overextended. According to Communist sources, Lin's army lost 15,000 soldiers in the fighting and withdrawal, but Nationalist sources claim that 25,000 soldiers also deserted or surrendered, and that Lin's force of 100,000 irregular auxiliaries suffered from mass desertion during the retreat. On June 10, the two forces agreed to a ceasefire brokered by George Marshall, and fighting temporarily ceased. Mao ordered Lin to counterattack that winter, but Lin refused, replying that his forces were exhausted and not logistically prepared to do so.Lew 36‚Äì37 When Du led the majority of his forces to attack Communist forces on the Korean border in January 1947, Lin finally ordered 20,000 of his soldiers to cross the Songhua River, where they staged guerrilla raids, ambushed relief forces, attacked isolated garrisons, and avoided decisive confrontations with strong units Du sent to defeat them. While they did so, they looted large quantities of supplies and destroyed the infrastructure of the KMT-held territories that they passed through, including bridges, railroads, fortifications, electrical lines, and boats. When Du sent his forces back south, they were ambushed and defeated. When Du requested reinforcements from Chiang Kai-shek, his request was rejected.Lew 66‚Äì68 On April 8, Lin moved his headquarters from Harbin to Shuangcheng in order to be closer to the front. On May 5, he held a conference with his subordinates and announced that his armies would change tactics, engage in a large-scale counterattack, and seek to defeat Du's forces in a decisive battle. On May 8, Lin launched the first of his \\"three great campaigns\\", the Summer Offensive, intending to engage a large garrison at Huaide while a second force positioned itself to ambush the force that would predictably be sent to relieve it. On May 17, they won a major victory and forced the survivors to retreat to Changchun and Siping. By the end of May 1947, Lin's forces had taken control of most of the countryside (everything except for the rail lines and several major cities), infiltrated and destroyed most KMT forces in Manchuria, and re-established contact with isolated Communist forces in southern Liaoning province.Lew 68‚Äì69 After the victory of the Summer Offensive, Lin's forces gained the initiative and Kuomintang defensive strategy became static and reactionary. Lin ordered his forces to besiege Siping, but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders' strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers' poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around Siping). Lin's forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By June 19, Lin's assault troops had become increasingly exhausted, and Lin began to rotate them to prevent them from becoming completely ineffective. On June 24, Nationalist reinforcements arrived from the south to lift the siege. Lin recognized that he did not have enough manpower left to defeat them, and on July 1, he ordered his forces to retreat back to the north of the Songhua River.Lew 70‚Äì71 The Communists suffered over 30,000 losses at Siping, and may have suffered a desertion rate of over 20% during the withdrawal, while the Nationalist garrison at Siping fell from 20,000 to slightly over 3,000 before the siege was broken. Lin volunteered to write a self-criticism after the defeat. He also criticized his commander at Siping, Li Tianyou, for demonstrating poor tactics and for lacking \\"revolutionary spirit\\". Despite the army's setbacks he reorganized the army, combining surviving regiments and raising local militia forces to the status of regular units. By the fall of 1947, he had 510,000 soldiers under his command, approximately equal to Nationalist forces in the region.Lew 71, 86 Before Du's replacement, Chen Cheng, could cross north and begin an offensive, Lin moved his army south and began the Autumn Offensive, in which his forces destroyed rail lines and other infrastructure, attacked isolated Nationalist units, and attempted to provoke and ambush strong Nationalist forces. Chen's forces responded to the campaign by withdrawing into their city garrisons. The Communists were not able to provoke a decisive confrontation, and the Autumn Offensive ended in a stalemate.Lew 87‚Äì88 Chen's forces remained static and reactionary, at the end of 1947, Lin led his armies back south in his final Liaoshen Campaign, the Winter Offensive. His initial plan was to repeat the goal of his last offensive, to besiege Jilin City and ambush its relief force, but after reviewing Kuomintang troop dispositions he determined that southern Manchuria would be an easier target. On December 15, Lin's forces attacked Fakui, Zhangwu, and Xinlitun. Chen sent reinforcements to relieve Fakui, and when the Communist ambush failed, Lin ordered his forces to withdraw and join in the siege of Zhangwu. When Chen did not intervene and the town fell on December 28, Lin assumed the main part of the campaign was over and he dispersed his forces to rest and attack secondary targets.Lew 94 Chen saw Lin's withdrawal as an opportunity to seize the offensive. He ordered his forces to attack targets in northern Liaoning on January 1, 1948, and on January 3, Lin successfully encircled the isolated Nationalist 5th Corps. Its commander, Chen Linda, realized that he was being surrounded and requested reinforcements, but Chen Cheng only responded that he would \\"allow\\" Chen Linda to withdraw. The attempted breakout failed, and the 5th Corps was destroyed on January 7. After this defeat, Chen Cheng was replaced with Wei Lihuang ten days later, but Wei was not able to prevent the Communists from capturing Liaoyang on February 6, destroying the 54th division, and severing an important railroad that linked Wei's forces from their ports on the Bohai Sea.Lew 94‚Äì95 Lin continued his advance, defeating all garrisons in western Manchuria or inducing them to defect by late February. On February 26 Lin reorganized his forces as the Northeastern Field Army and began preparations to return and take Siping, whose garrison had been transferred elsewhere by Chen Cheng and never re-strengthened. Lin began the general assault on the city on March 13, and took the town one day later. The capture of Siping ended Lin's Winter Offensive. The KMT nearly lost all of Manchuria by the end of the campaign and suffered 156,000 casualties, most of which survived as prisoners of war that were indoctrinated and recruited into Lin's forces. By the end of winter 1948 the Kuomintang had lost all of its territory in the Northeast, except for Changchun, Shenyang, and an area connecting the rail line from Beiping to those cities.Lew 95‚Äì97 Following Lin's Winter campaign, Mao wanted him to attack targets farther south, but Lin disagreed because he did not want to leave a strong enemy at his back, and he believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By May 25, 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, Zheng Dongguo, depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On May 19, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By July 20 the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack Jinzhou farther south, beginning the Liaoshen Campaign. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On October 14, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin's artillery and armor. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin's forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, Fan Hanjie, and 90,000 enemy soldiers.Lew 108‚Äì112 After hearing the news about the defeat at Jinzhou, a KMT army from Yunnan and its commander, Zeng Zesheng, defected and abandoned its position on the outskirts of Changchun on October 14. This doomed the remaining Nationalist forces in the city, and Zheng Dongguo was forced to surrender two days later. Chiang ordered the 9th army of 110,000 men under General Liao Yaoxiang to travel west and retake Jinzhou, but Lin directed nearly all of his forces to stop them, and they began to encircle the relief unit on October 21. After a week of fighting, the Nationalist army was destroyed on October 28. Remaining KMT garrisons in the Northeast attempted to break out of the region and flee south, but most were unsuccessful. After Changchun, the only major KMT garrison in the Northeast was Shenyang, where 140,000 KMT soldiers were eventually forced to surrender. By the end of 1948 all of Northeast China was under Communist control.Lew 112‚Äì114 =Defeating the Kuomintang= After taking control of the Manchurian provinces, Lin then swept into North China. Forces under Lin were responsible for winning two of the three major military victories responsible for the defeat of the Kuomintang. Lin suffered from ongoing periods of serious illness throughout the campaign. Following the victory in Manchuria, Lin commanded over a million soldiers, encircling Chiang's main forces in northern China during the Pingjin Campaign, taking Beijing and Tianjin within a period of two months. Tianjin was taken by force, and on January 22, 1949 General Fu Zuoyi and his army of 400,000 men agreed to surrender Beijing without a battle, and the PLA occupied the city on January 31. The Pingjin Campaign saw Lin remove a total of approximately 520,000 enemy troops from the enemy's battle lines. Many of those who surrendered later joined the PLA.Barnouin and Yu 116 After taking Beijing, the Communists attempted to negotiate for the surrender of the remaining KMT forces. When these negotiations failed, Lin resumed his attacks on the KMT in the southeast. After taking Beijing, Lin's army numbered 1.5 million soldiers. He crossed the Yangtze River in the Spring of 1949 and decisively defeated the defending KMT army stationed in central China during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. Lin's armies continued to defeat KMT armies farther south, finally occupying all KMT positions on mainland China by the end of 1949. The last position occupied by Lin's forces was the tropical island of Hainan.Tanner (2013) 207 Lin Biao was considered one of the Communists' most brilliant generals after the founding of the People's Republic of China, in 1949. Lin was the youngest of the \\"Ten Marshals\\" named in 1955, a title that recognized Lin's substantial military contributions. Politician =Illness= Marshal Lin Biao Lin Biao continued to suffer from poor health after 1949, and chose to avoid high-profile military and political positions. His status led him to be appointed to a number of high-profile positions throughout most of the 1950s, but these were largely honorary and carried few responsibilities. He generally delegated or neglected many of the formal political responsibilities that he was assigned, usually citing his poor health. After Lin's injury in 1938, he suffered from ongoing physical and mental health problems. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao's personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from neurasthenia and hypochondria. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias about water, wind, cold, light, and noise. He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water.Qiu The Culture of Power. 145 Li's account of Lin's condition is notably different from the official Chinese version. In another study, Lin is described as having symptoms similar to those seen in patients of schizoid personality disorder. Lin's personality traits including his aloofness, lack of interest in social relationships, secretiveness, and emotional coldness he exhibited during the Cultural Revolution suggest Lin suffered from symptoms similar to those seen in schizoid personality disorder. The challenge of Lin's personality problems in conjunction with the turbulent political climate of the Cultural Revolution impacted his overall ability to govern his position.Luna, Adrian. \\"Bringing the Inside Out: Health, Personality, Politics, and the Tragedy of Lin Biao\\" VDM Verlag, January 2008. Lin suffered from excessive headaches, and spent much of his free time consulting Chinese medical texts and preparing traditional Chinese medicines for himself. He suffered from insomnia, and often took sleeping pills.Hannam and Lawrence 2‚Äì3 He ate simple meals, did not smoke, and did not drink alcohol. As his condition progressed, his fear of water led to a general refusal to either bathe or eat fruit. Because of his fear of wind and light, his office was gloomy and lacked any ventilation. Some accounts have suggested that Lin became a drug addict, either to opium or morphine. As early as 1953, Soviet doctors diagnosed Lin as suffering from manic depression. Lin's wife, Ye Qun, rejected this diagnosis, but it was later confirmed by Chinese doctors. Lin's fragile health made him vulnerable, passive, and easily manipulated by other political figures, notably Ye Qun herself. Lin's complaints got worse with time and age. In the years before his death, the fianc√©e of Lin's son reported that Lin became extremely distant and socially and politically detached, even to the extent that he never read books or newspapers. His passivity made him difficult to connect with at any meaningful level: \\"usually he just sat there, blankly\\". In Lin's rare periods of activity, he used his time mostly to complain about, and seek treatment for his large variety of medical issues. =Alliance with Mao= Lin, like most of the Politburo, initially held serious reservations about China's entry into the Korean War, citing the devastation that would result if the \\"imperialists\\" (Americans) detonated an atomic bomb in Korea or China. Lin later declined to lead forces in Korea, citing his ill health.Barnouin and Yu 142‚Äì143, 145 In early October 1950, Peng Dehuai was named commander of the Chinese forces bound for Korea, and Lin went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Lin flew to the Soviet Union with Zhou Enlai and participated in negotiations with Joseph Stalin concerning Soviet support for China's intervention, indicating that Mao retained his trust in Lin. Due partially to his periods of ill health and physical rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, Lin was slow to rise to power. In the early 1950s Lin was one of five major leaders given responsibility for civil and military affairs, controlling a jurisdiction in central China. In 1953 he was visited by Gao Gang, and was later suspected of supporting him.Barnouin and Yu 164, 166 In 1955 Lin was named to the Politburo. In February 1958 Peng Dehuai, then China's Defense Minister, gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army in which he suggested increasing the military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao wanted to distance China from the Soviet Union, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng.Domes 82 In 1958 Lin joined the Politburo Standing CommitteeLee 172 and became one of China's Vice-Chairmen. After the 1959 Lushan Conference, at which Peng criticized Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, Peng was arrested and removed from all government positions. Privately, Lin agreed with Peng and was strongly opposed to Peng being purged, but Lin's fear of being purged himself kept him from publicly opposing Mao's efforts to purge Peng,Hu Xingdou 1 and Lin publicly condemned Peng as a \\"careerist, a conspiracist, and a hypocrite\\".Barnouin and Yu 183 Under Mao's direction, Peng was disgraced and put under indefinite house arrest. Lin became the senior leader most publicly supportive of Mao following the Great Leap Forward,Barnouin and Yu 191 during which Mao's economic policies caused an artificial famine in which tens of millions of people starved to death.Yang. Section I For example, Lin publicly defended Mao during the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in 1962. Lin initially refused to replace Peng, but eventually accepted the position at the insistence of Mao Zedong. As Defense Minister, Lin's command of the PLA was second only to Mao, but he deferred many of his responsibilities to subordinates. The most important figures to whom Lin deferred the day-to-day operations of China's armed forces were Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff, and He Long, the Central Military Vice-Chairman. On October 1, 1959, Lin Biao, as defense minister, surveyed the honor guards at the military parade celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. As Defense Minister, Lin's policies differed from those of his predecessor. Lin attempted to reform China's armed forces based on political criteria: he abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged members considered sympathetic to the USSR, directed soldiers to work part- time as industrial and agricultural workers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought.Snow. \\"Biographical Notes\\". Lin's system of indoctrination made it clear the Party was in command of China's armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army's political commissars enjoyed great power and status in order to see that his directives were followed. Lin implemented these reforms in order to please Mao, but privately was concerned that they would weaken the PLA (which they did). Mao strongly approved of these reforms, and conscientiously promoted Lin to a series of high positions.Qiu The Culture of Power. 15 Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by promoting Mao's cult of personality.Tanner (2009) 522 Lin devised and ran a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA, the most successful of which was the \\"learn from Lei Feng\\" campaign, which Lin began in 1963.Ebrey 442 Because he was the person most responsible for directing the \\"learn from Lei Feng\\" campaign, Lin may have directed the forging of Lei Feng's Diary, upon which the propaganda campaign was based. Because of Lin's fragile health, Ye Qun controlled many aspects of Lin's public life during the 1960s, including who would see Lin and what others would know about him. Mao encouraged Ye to act on Lin's behalf, giving her an unusual amount of power and responsibility. In 1965 Mao asked Ye to publicly criticize Lin's chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, on Lin's behalf, even though Ye did not yet hold any high political position. When Lin discovered that Ye had done so (after Luo was purged), he was angry at Ye, but powerless to alter Luo's disgrace.Qiu The Culture of Power. 149 Lin often read speeches prepared by others, and allowed his name to be placed on articles that he did not write, as long as these materials supported Mao. One of the most famous articles published in Lin's nameTeiwes and Sun 5 was the 20,000-word pamphlet on revolution in developing countries, Long Live the Victory of the People's War!, which was released in 1965. This article made Lin one of China's leading interpreters of Mao's political theories. The article likened the \\"emerging forces\\" of the poor in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the \\"rural areas of the world\\", while the affluent countries of the West were likened to the \\"cities of the world\\". Eventually the \\"cities\\" would be encircled by revolutions in the \\"rural areas\\", following theories prevalent in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin made no promise that China would fight other people's wars, and foreign revolutionaries were advised to depend mainly on \\"self-reliance\\". Lin worked closely with Mao, promoting Mao's cult of personality. Lin directed the compilation of some of Chairman Mao's writings into a handbook, the Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, which became known as the Little Red Book.Han Lin Biao's military reforms and the success of the 1962 Sino-Indian War impressed Mao. A propaganda campaign called \\"learn from the People's Liberation Army\\" followed. In 1966, this campaign widened into the Cultural Revolution.  Cultural Revolution  Lin Biao's calligraphy in the Summer Palace, 1966 =Rise to prominence= Lin's support impressed Mao, who continued to promote Lin to higher political offices. After Mao's second-in-command, President Liu Shaoqi, was denounced as a \\"capitalist roader\\" in 1966, Lin Biao emerged as the most likely candidate to replace Liu as Mao's successor. Lin attempted to avoid this promotion, but accepted it on Mao's insistence. Privately, Lin opposed the purging of Liu and Deng Xiaoping, on the grounds that they were \\"good comrades\\", but was not able to publicly oppose Mao's condemnation of them. Lin privately admired Liu, and once told his daughter that Liu had \\"a better understanding of theory than Mao\\". Zhou Enlai was also considered for the position of Vice-Chairman, but Zhou successfully withdrew from the nomination, leaving Lin the only candidate. Lin also seriously attempted to withdraw from the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities.Qiu The Culture of Power. 78‚Äì79 In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again attempted to submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage. Because there was no way to avoid becoming Mao's second-in-command, Lin attempted to protect himself from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution by giving absolute support to Mao and doing very little else. Lin avoided expressing any opinion, or making any decision on any matter, until Mao's own opinions and positions on that matter were clear, after which Lin would adhere as closely to Mao's direction as possible. Lin made sure that, whenever he and Mao were scheduled to appear in the same place, Lin would always arrive earlier than Mao, waiting to greet the Chairman. Lin attempted to make all observers believe that he was Mao's closest follower, always appearing beside Mao in all of Mao's public appearances with a copy of Mao's Little Red Book.Qiu Distorting History When he was informed that the public's image of Lin was that he was \\"Mao's best student\\", Lin was pleased, and stated: \\"I don't have any talent. What I know, I learned from Mao.\\"Qiu The Culture of Power. 79‚Äì80 =Activities= Mao‚Äôs Little Red Book (1971)230px Because Lin had no real interest in the position of Vice-Chairman, he did little other than whatever he believed would ingratiate himself to Mao. Privately, Lin had no interest in promoting the Cultural Revolution, and attended government meetings only when Mao demanded that he do so. Those colleagues closest to Lin noted that Lin avoided talking about the Cultural Revolution in any context other than public speeches, and when pressed would only make very brief and ambiguous statements. After 1966, Lin made no phone calls, received few visitors, secluded himself from his colleagues, and gained a reputation as being \\"reticent and mysterious\\". He did not take an active role in government, but allowed his secretaries to read short summaries of selected documents for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon. This was generally insufficient to fulfill the responsibilities of vice-chairman,Qiu The Culture of Power 80 and he left most important work and family duties to his wife, Ye Qun. Lin's passivity was part of a calculated plan to survive the Cultural Revolution alive and well. When Lin perceived that his longtime subordinate, Tao Zhu, was in danger of being purged in the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Lin sent a letter to warn Tao, advising Tao to be \\"passive, passive, and passive again\\". Tao probably did not understand Lin's advice, and was subsequently purged in 1967. In his relationship with Mao, Lin adopted a policy of \\"three 'nos': no responsibility; no suggestions; no crime\\".Hu Xingdou 2 Following the lead of Mao, in 1966 Lin directed Red Guards in Beijing to \\"smash those persons in power who are traveling the capitalist road, the bourgeoisie reactionary authorities, and all royalists of the bourgeoisie, and to forcibly destroy the \\"four olds\\": old culture, old ideas, old customs, and old habits.Barnouin and Yu 226, 229 In August 1966 Lin publicly called for a \\"three-month turmoil\\" within the PLA, and on October 6 Lin's Central Military Commission issued an urgent instruction that all military academies and institutes were to dismiss their classes and allow their students to become fully involved in the Cultural Revolution. Following the orders of this directive, officers and commissars were expelled from their positions, and some were beaten to death.China at War 136 Students at Chinese military academies followed Lin's instructions to rebel against their senior officers, breaking into the offices of Lin's National Commission for Defense Science to abduct one of the department's directors, and claiming Lin's deputy chief of staff, Li Tianyu, whom students accused of disciplining them. The students \\"overthrew\\" General Xiao Hua, the head of the PLA's Political Department since the previous July, and went on to purge 40 other top officers working under him in the Political Department, most of whom died in prison. Lin continued to support the Red Guards until May 1967, when Mao accepted Zhou Enlai's appeals to moderate their radical activity through military intervention. Lin moderated some of the most radical activity within the PLA; but, from 1967 to 1969, 80,000 officers were purged, 1,169 of whom died from torture, starvation, or execution. Research programs were cancelled and the number of military academies across China shrank by two-thirds. Many defensive fortifications were destroyed, and regular training within the PLA ceased. After 1966, Lin's few personal political initiatives were efforts to moderate the radical nature of the Cultural Revolution. Privately, he expressed unhappiness with the Cultural Revolution, but was unable to avoid playing a high-profile role due to the expectations of Mao, China's unpredictable political environment, and the manipulations of his wife and son, Ye Qun and Lin Liguo. After 1966, Lin, like Liu before him, attempted to build his own base of support so that he could better position himself for the inevitable, unpredictable political situation that would occur following the death of Mao.Robinson 1081 Lin's few proactive attempts to direct the Cultural Revolution were attempts to protect Red Guards and his political allies from political persecution, and to mediate the attempts of Jiang Qing and her followers to radicalize China's political climate. In May 1967, Lin's follower, Chen Boda, saved Zhou Enlai from being persecuted by Red Guards by convincing them that Zhou was Lin's follower and supporter. Zhou repaid Lin's assistance by giving him excessive public praise three months later, in August, but was forced to write a formal apology to Lin after Lin complained to Mao that such praise was inappropriate.Barnouin and Yu 236‚Äì237, 241‚Äì243 Lin and Jiang cooperated at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, but their relationship began to deteriorate in 1968 as Jiang frequently attempted to interfere in Chinese military affairs, which Lin found intolerable.Barnouin and Yu 272 By 1970 Lin and Ye were very unfriendly with Jiang Qing: Lin referred to her as a \\"long-nosed pit viper\\". From 1968 until his death in 1971, Lin and his supporters disagreed with Zhou Enlai and his followers over the issue of China's relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union. Lin believed that both superpowers were equally threatening to China, and that they were colluding to thwart China's interests. Zhou Enlai believed that China should become closer to the United States in order to mitigate the threat posed by the Soviet military. Lin was supported by Jiang Qing in his opposition to pursuing a relationship with the United States, but was not able to permanently disrupt Zhou's efforts to contact the American officials.Ross 268 Lin Biao, as Defense Minister, was responsible for the Chinese response to the Zhenbao Island incident of March 1969, a battle with the Soviet Union over a small, uninhabited island on the border of Mongolia. Lin issued a report labeling the Soviet Union a \\"chauvinist\\" and \\"social imperialist\\" power, and issuing orders warning Chinese troops to be wary of an impending Soviet attack. Lin's followers attempted to use the hysteria generated by the incident in an effort to deepen the power that they had gained during the Cultural Revolution, disregarding and acting against the interests of Zhou Enlai and his supporters.Uhalley and Qiu 389 =Height of power= Lin Biao with Mao Zedong Lin officially became China's second-in- charge in April 1969, following the 1st Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Lin's position as Mao's \\"closest comrade-in-arms and successor\\" was recognized when the Party constitution was formally revised to reflect Lin's future succession.Uhalley and Qiu 388 At the 9th Central Committee, Lin's faction was unquestionably dominant within the Politburo. Of the Politburo's twenty-one full members, Lin counted on the support of six members: the generals Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizo, Ye Qun; and Chen Boda, an ambitious ideologue. Lin's support surpassed the number of members aligned with Jiang Qing, and far surpassed those aligned with Zhou Enlai. Because over 45% of the Central Committee were members of the army, Lin's supporters dominated the Politburo, and Lin's power was second only to Mao's.Ross 269‚Äì270 During the Second Plenary Session of the 9th Central Committee, held in Lushan from August‚ÄìSeptember 1970, Mao became uncomfortable with Lin's growing power, and began to maneuver against Lin by undermining his supporters and attacking some of Lin's suggestions at the conference. At the Second Plenum, Lin advocated that Chairman Mao take the position of President, which had not been filled in since the removal of Liu Shaoqi, but Mao dismissed this appeal, suspecting Lin of using it to increase his own power. Mao did not attack Lin directly, but showed his displeasure by attacking Lin's ally, Chen Boda, who was quickly disgraced. Lin kept his position, but the events of the Lushan Conference revealed a growing distrust between Lin and Mao.He 248 Because Lin was one of the most influential figures in promoting Mao's personality cult, he began to be criticized within the Party for its excesses later in 1970. After 1970, some factions within the Army, and those led by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing, began to distance themselves from Lin. In order to limit Lin's growing power, Mao approved Zhou's efforts to rehabilitate a number of civilian officials who had been purged during the first years of the Cultural Revolution, and supported Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States.Ross 270‚Äì272 A serious rift developed between Mao and Lin. Mao was displeased with comments that Lin had made about his wife, Jiang Qing, at the Lushan Conference. Generals loyal to Lin refused to accept Mao's criticism of them, and Mao began to question whether Lin continued to follow him unconditionally. Mao wanted Lin to make a self-criticism, but Lin stayed away from Beijing and resisted doing so. Ye Qun made a self-criticism, but it was rejected by Mao as not genuine. Zhou Enlai attempted to mediate between Mao and Lin, but by 1971 Lin had become extremely reclusive and difficult to talk with at any level, and Zhou's mediation failed. In July 1971 Mao decided to remove Lin and his supporters. Zhou again attempted to moderate Mao's resolution to act against Lin, but failed.Qiu The Culture of Power. 134‚Äì135 \\"Lin Biao incident\\" and death Project 571 Outline Lin died when a plane carrying him and several members of his family crashed in Mongolia at 3:00 am on September 13, 1971, allegedly after attempting to assassinate Mao and defect to the Soviet Union. Following Lin's death, there has been widespread skepticism in the West concerning the official Chinese explanation, but forensic investigation conducted by the USSR (which recovered the bodies following the crash) has confirmed that Lin was among those who died in the crash.Mackerras, McMillen, and Watson. 140 =Official Chinese narrative= Lin Liguo with Ye Qun According to the Chinese government, Lin Biao was made aware that Mao no longer trusted him after the 9th Central Committee, and he harbored a strong desire to seize supreme power. In February 1971 Lin and his wife, Ye Qun (who was then a Politburo member), began to plot Mao's assassination. In March 1971, Lin's son, Lin Liguo (who was a senior Air Force officer) held a secret meeting with his closest followers at an Air Force base in Shanghai. At this meeting, Lin Liguo and his subordinates supposedly drafted a plan to organize a coup, titled \\"Project 571\\" (in Chinese, \\"5-7-1\\" is a homophone for \\"armed uprising\\"). Later that March, the group met again to formalize the structure of command following the proposed coup. Mao was unaware of the coup plot, and, in August 1971, scheduled a conference for September to determine the political fate of Lin Biao. On August 15 Mao left Beijing to discuss the issue with other senior political and military leaders in southern China. On September 5, Lin received reports that Mao was preparing to purge him. On September 8, Lin gave the order to his subordinates to proceed with the coup. Lin's subordinates planned to assassinate Mao by sabotaging his train before he returned to Beijing, but Mao unexpectedly changed his route on September 11. Mao's bodyguards foiled several subsequent attempts on Mao's life, and Mao safely returned to Beijing in the evening of September 12. By failing to assassinate Mao, Lin's coup attempt failed.He 249 Realizing that Mao was now fully aware of his abortive coup, Lin's party first considered fleeing south to their base of power in Guangzhou, where they would establish an alternate \\"Party headquarters\\" and attack armed forces loyal to Mao. After hearing that Premier Zhou Enlai was investigating the incident, they abandoned this plan as impractical, and decided to flee to the Soviet Union instead. In the early morning of September 13, Lin Biao, Ye Qun, Lin Liguo, and several personal aides attempted to flee to the Soviet Union and boarded a prearranged Trident 1-E (a CAAC B-256), piloted by Pan Jingyin, the deputy commander of the PLAAF 34th division. The plane did not take aboard enough fuel before taking off, ran out of fuel, and crashed near √ñnd√∂rkhaan in Mongolia on September 13, 1971. Everyone on board, eight men and one woman, was killed.Hannam and Lawrence 2 =International view of official Chinese explanation= The exact circumstances surrounding Lin's death remain unclear, due to a lack of surviving evidence. Many of the original government records relevant to Lin's death were secretly and intentionally destroyed, with the approval of the Politburo, during the brief period of Hua Guofeng's interregnum in the late 1970s. Among the records destroyed were telephone records, meeting minutes, personal notes, and desk diaries. The records, if they had survived, would have clarified the activities of Mao, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, and Wang Dongxing relative to Lin, before and after Lin's death. Because of the destruction of government documentation related to Lin's death, the Chinese government has relied on alleged confessions of purged officials close to Lin to corroborate the official narrative, but non-Chinese scholars generally regard these confessions as unreliable. Ever since 1971, scholars outside of China have been skeptical of the government's official explanation of the circumstances surrounding Lin's death. Skeptics assert that the official narrative does not sufficiently explain why Lin, one of Mao's closest supporters and one of the most successful Communist generals, would suddenly attempt a poorly planned, abortive coup. The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin's plane crashed. Skeptics have claimed that Lin's decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds that the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations. Western historians have contended that Lin did not have either the intention or the ability to usurp Mao's place within the government or the Party. One theory attempted to explain Lin's flight and death by observing that Lin opposed China's rapprochement with the United States, which Zhou Enlai was organizing with Mao's approval.Ross 265 Because the Chinese government never produced evidence to support their report that Lin was on board the plane that crashed in Mongolia, Western scholars originally doubted that Lin had died in the crash. One book, published anonymously using a Chinese pseudonym in 1983, claimed that Mao had actually had Lin and his wife killed in Beijing, and that Lin Liguo had attempted to escape by air. Other scholars suggested that Mao had ordered the Chinese army to shoot down Lin's plane over Mongolia.Hannam and Lawrence 1 The Chinese government has no interest in re-evaluating its narrative on Lin Biao's death. When contacted for its comment on fresh evidence that surfaced on the Lin Biao incident after the Cold War, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated: \\"China already has a clear, authoritative conclusion about the Lin Biao incident. Other foreign reports of a conjectural nature are groundless.\\" Non-Chinese scholars interpreted China's reluctance to consider evidence that contradicts its \\"official\\" history as the result of a desire to avoid exploring any issue that may lead to criticism of Mao Zedong or a re-evaluation of the Cultural Revolution in general, which may distract China from pursuing economic growth. =Subsequent scholarship and reliable eyewitness accounts= Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport, provenance of the aircraft A six-month investigation by Western scholars in 1994 examined evidence in Russia, Mongolia, mainland China, the United States, and Taiwan, and came to a number of conclusions, some of which were contrary to the official Chinese version of events. The study confirmed that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo were all killed in the crash. Lin's plane was travelling away from the Soviet Union at the time of its crash, making the exact sequence of events before Lin's death more confusing, and casting doubt on the possibility that Lin was attempting to seek asylum in the USSR. Lin's wife and son may have forced Lin to board the plane against his will. Several senior leaders within the Communist Party hierarchy knew that Lin and his family would flee, but chose not to attempt to stop their flight. According to this study, Lin had attempted to contact the Kuomintang in Taiwan on two separate occasions shortly before his death. The findings of Lin's attempt to contact the Kuomintang supported earlier rumors from inside China that Lin was secretly negotiating with Chiang's government in order to restore the Kuomintang government in mainland China in return for a high position in the new government. The claims of Lin's contact with the Kuomintang have never been formally confirmed nor denied by either the governments in Beijing or Taipei. The eyewitness account of Zhang Ning, who was Lin Liguo's fianc√©e before his death, and another witness who requested anonymity, indicate a sequence of events different from the official narrative. According to Zhang, Lin Biao had become extremely passive and inactive by 1971. When Lin Liguo informed Ye Qun that Mao was preparing to strip Ye of her Politburo seat, the two became convinced that their family would be purged if they failed to act, and developed a plan to escape. At 10 o'clock the night before Lin's party fled, Ye Qun announced that the family would board a plane at 7 the next morning to fly to Guangzhou. Lin's 27-year-old daughter, Lin Liheng (known by the nickname \\"Doudou\\") opposed the escape plan, and contacted Lin's bodyguards to request that they guard her father from Ye. Doudou then phoned Zhou Enlai,Hannam and Lawrence 3 but was not able to contact him directly, and Zhou only received Doudou's report second-hand. Zhou received Doudou's message shortly after Doudou's phone call, directly from the general office of the Central Committee responsible for guarding China's senior leaders. The message contained Doudou's warning that Ye Qun and Lin Liguo were attempting to persuade Lin Biao to flee the country using an aircraft currently being prepared at Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport. Zhou called Wu Faxian, the commander of the air force, who verified the plane's existence. Zhou then issued orders that the plane could not take off without the written permission of himself and several other senior military officials, including Wu Faxian, general chief-of-staff Huang Yongsheng, and the commander of the navy and general chief-of-staff, Li Zuopeng. At 11:30, Ye Qun called Zhou and informed him that Lin Biao was planning to fly to Dalian, and denied that they had prepared a plane at Shanhaiguan. Zhou then told Ye to wait for him to travel to see Lin before they left Beidaihe (where they were staying), issued orders to neutralize potentially disruptive officers close to Lin (Wu Faxian and Huang Yongsheng), and ordered two planes readied in Beijing so that he could fly to Lin's residence to personally deal with the matter.Barnouin and Yu 272‚Äì273 Ye made an announcement that the party were to pack quickly. Two hours after Doudou contacted Zhou, soldiers had still not responded in any meaningful way. Ye and Lin Liguo woke Lin Biao and packed him into a waiting limousine. The party then drove to Shanhaiguan airport, 25 miles away from their residence in Beidaihe, where their plane was waiting. Lin's bodyguards told Doudou and another companion that they were ordered to take them as well, but Doudou and her companion refused. One soldier shot at Lin Biao's limousine as it left Beidaihe, but missed, and most soldiers that the party encountered on their way to the airport allowed the limousine to pass. According to the driver of Lin's limousine, there was no time to place mobile stairs next to the plane's entrance, so the party boarded the plane via a rope ladder. Lin Biao was so weak that he had to be lifted and pulled onto the plane. Zhang Ning observed the plane after it left the airport. Lin's plane initially traveled southeast (in the direction of Guangzhou). The plane then returned twenty minutes later and circled the airport several times as if it were trying to land, but the runway lights had been turned off. Soviet officials and Mongolian witnesses reported that the plane then flew north, over Mongolia and almost to the Soviet border, but then turned around and began flying south before it crashed. A Mongolian who witnessed the plane crash reported that the plane's tail was on fire when it crashed.Hannam and Lawrence 1, 3 The crash occurred at around 3:00 AM. None of Zhou's instructions prevented Lin's flight, and he learned that Lin's plane had taken off before he, himself, could fly to see Lin. Zhou then ordered all planes nationwide grounded without the written permission of Mao, himself, and several senior military leaders. He rushed to Zhongnanhai to brief Mao of Lin's flight, and asked Mao if he wanted to order Lin's plane shot down, but Mao replied that they should \\"let him go\\". At 8:30 PM, September 13, the Mongolian Foreign Ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to make a formal complaint about the unauthorized entrance of a plane into Mongolian airspace, and reported to the ambassador that the plane had crashed, killing all on board. The Chinese ambassador to Mongolia then phoned Zhou Enlai, who then instructed the ambassador to tell the Mongolians that the plane had entered Mongolian airspace because it had gone off course.Barnouin and Yu 273‚Äì274 Mongolian investigators were the first to inspect the wreckage, arriving later the same day. They found an identity card belonging to Lin Liguo, confirming Lin Liguo's presence on the flight. Markings on the plane and surviving miscellaneous personal items confirmed that the plane and passengers had originated from China, but the Mongolians were uncertain that any of the dead were either Lin Biao or Ye Qun. After inspecting the crash, the Mongolians buried the dead onsite. Through the Chinese ambassador, Zhou requested and received permission for Chinese embassy staff to inspect the wreckage of Lin's plane, which they did on September 15‚Äì16. The staff reported to Zhou that the plane had caught fire while attempting to land, and then exploded. Zhou then sent additional staff to interview Mongolian witnesses of the crash, and to perform a detailed technical assessment of the crash. The report concluded that the plane had approximately 30 minutes of fuel when it crashed, but attempted to land without activating its landing gear or wing flaps.Barnouin and Yu 274 Later in 1971 a Soviet medical team secretly traveled to the crash site and exhumed the bodies, which were by then modestly decomposed. The team removed the heads of two of the corpses suspected to be Lin Biao and Ye Qun and took them back to Russia for forensic examination. In 1972 the team concluded that the heads belonged to Lin Biao and Ye Qun (the heads are still stored in Russian archives). In order to corroborate their findings the team returned to Mongolia a second time to inspect the body believed to be Lin Biao's. After exhuming the body a second time the team found that the corpse's right lung had the remains of tuberculosis, which Lin had suffered from, confirming the Soviet identification. The Soviet team were not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude. Judging from the fires that burned after the plane crashed, the Soviets estimated that it had enough fuel to fly to the Soviet cities of Irkutsk or Chita. All of the work and its results were kept secret from the public: outside of the investigative team, only KGB director Yuri Andropov and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev were informed. The report remained classified until the early 1990s, after the end of the Cold War.Hannam and Lawrence 3‚Äì4 =Aftermath= Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's Little Red Book. Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death. Lin Biao was survived by Doudou and one other daughter. All military officials identified as being close to Lin or his family (most of China's high military command) were purged within weeks of Lin's disappearance. On September 14, Zhou announced to the Politburo that four of the highest-ranking military officials in China were immediately suspended from duty and ordered to submit self-criticisms admitting their associations with Lin. This announcement was quickly followed by the arrest of ninety-three people suspected of being close to Lin,Barnouin and Yu 275 and within a month of Lin's disappearance over 1,000 senior Chinese military officials were purged. The official purge of Lin's supporters continued until it was closed by the 10th Central Committee in August 1973.Barnouin and Yu 280 The incident marked the end of the myth within the Party that Mao had always been absolutely correct. The National Day celebrations on October 1, 1971, were cancelled. The news of Lin's death was announced to all Communist Party officials in mid-October 1971, and to the Chinese public in November. The news was publicly received with shock and confusion. Mao Zedong was especially disturbed by the incident: his health deteriorated, and he became depressed. At the end of 1971, he became seriously ill; he suffered a stroke in January 1972, received emergency medical treatment, and his health remained unstable. Mao became nostalgic about some of his revolutionary comrades whose purging Lin had supported, and backed Zhou Enlai's efforts to conduct a widespread rehabilitation of veteran revolutionaries, and to correct some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution (which he blamed on Lin Biao).Barnouin and Yu 275‚Äì276 In the aftermath of the purge of Lin's supporters, Zhou Enlai replaced Lin as the second most powerful man in China, and Jiang Qing and her followers were never able to displace him. Without the support of Lin, Jiang was unable to prevent Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States, or to rehabilitate cadres who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution.Ross 275‚Äì276 The clause in the Party constitution indicating that Lin was Mao's successor was not officially amended until the 10th Central Committee in August 1973. The position of the Chinese government on Lin and the circumstances of his death changed several times over the decade following 1971. For over a year, the Party first attempted to cover up the details of Lin's death. The government then began to issue partial details of the event, followed by an anti-Lin Biao propaganda campaign. After Mao's death, in 1976, the government confirmed its condemnation of Lin and generally ceased any dialogue concerning Lin's place in history.Robinson 1080 Throughout the 1970s, high-ranking leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Hua Guofeng, spread the story to foreign delegates that Lin had conspired with the KGB to assassinate Mao.Pacepa In 1973 Jiang Qing, Mao's fourth wife and a former political ally of Lin's, started the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign, aimed at using Lin's scarred image to attack Zhou Enlai. Much of this propaganda campaign involved the creative falsification of history, including (false) details about how Lin had opposed Mao's leadership and tactics throughout his career.Hu Chi-hsi 269 Lin's name became involved in Jiang's propaganda campaign after flashcards, made by Ye Qun to record Lin's thoughts, were discovered in Lin's residence following his death. Some of these flashcards recorded opinions critical of Mao. According to Lin's writings, Mao \\"will fabricate 'your' opinion first, then he will change 'your' opinion ‚Äì which is not actually yours, but his fabrication. I should be careful of this standard trick.\\" Another critical comment of Lin's states that Mao \\"worships himself and has a blind faith in himself. He worships himself to such an extent that all accomplishments are attributed to him, but all mistakes are made by others\\".Qiu The Culture of Power. 78 Lin's private criticisms of Mao were directly contradictory of the public image cultivated by Lin, who publicly stated following the Great Leap Forward that all mistakes of the past were the result of deviating from Mao's instructions.Barnouin and Yu 190 Like many major proponents of the Cultural Revolution, Lin's image was manipulated after Mao's death in 1976, and many negative aspects of the Cultural Revolution were blamed on Lin. After October 1976, those in power also blamed Mao's supporters, the so-called Gang of Four. In 1980, the Chinese government held a series of \\"special trials\\" to identify those most responsible for the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the government released their verdict: that Lin Biao must be held, along with Jiang Qing, as one of the two major \\"counter-revolutionary cliques\\" responsible for the excesses of the late 1960s. According to the official Party verdict, Lin and Jiang were singled out for blame because they led intra-Party cliques which took advantage of Mao's \\"mistakes\\" to advance their own political goals, engaging in \\"criminal activity\\" for their own self-benefit. Among the \\"crimes\\" he was charged with was the ouster of China's head of state, President Liu Shaoqi. Lin was found to be primarily responsible for using \\"false evidence\\" to orchestrate a \\"political frame-up\\" of Liu.North 2 Lin has been officially remembered as one of the greatest villains of modern China since then. Lin was never politically rehabilitated, so the charges against him continue to stand. For several decades, Lin's name and image were censored within China, but in recent years a balanced image of Lin has reappeared in popular culture: surviving aides and family members have published memoirs about their experience with Lin; scholars have explored most surviving evidence relevant to his life and death, and have gained exposure within the official Chinese media; movies set before 1949 have made reference to Lin; and Lin's name has re-appeared in Chinese history textbooks, recognizing his contributions to the victory of the Red Army. Within modern China, Lin is regarded as one of the Red Army's best military strategists. In 2007, a big portrait of Lin was added to the Chinese Military Museum in Beijing, included in a display of the \\"Ten Marshals\\", a group considered to be the founders of China's armed forces.

The lake, named after the city of Lugano, is situated between Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. It was cited for the first time by Gregory of Tours in 590 with the name Ceresio, a name which is said to have derived from the Latin word cerasus, meaning cherry, and refers to the abundance of cherry trees which at one time adorned the shores of the lake. The lake appears in documents in 804 under the name Laco Luanasco. Lake Lugano Well-known mountains and tourist destinations on the shores of the lake are Monte Br√® to the east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the south-east shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is situated south of the lake. History The first certain testimony of a political body governing the shores of the lake is from 818. Occupying an area of strategic importance, the lake was then part of the feudal dominion of the County of Sperio. Circa 1000, it came under the control of the Bishop of Como. The region was the site of the war between Como and Milan over control of Alpine traffic from 1218 to 1227. As the lake and its shores became progressively incorporated into the Duchy of Milan they became the subject of political and territorial contention during the 15th century, and Lugano became the lake's main town. The lake definitively ceased to belong to a single sovereign political entity following the establishment of the transalpine bailiwicks of the Swiss cantons at the beginning of the 16th century. The Italian-Swiss border was fixed in 1752 by the Treaty of Varese, and has since remained virtually unchanged. In 1848, the Melide causeway was built on a moraine between Melide and Bissone, in order to carry a road across the lake and provide a direct connection between Lugano and Chiasso. Today the causeway also carries the Gotthard railway and the A2 motorway. Geography Map of the lake Lake Lugano with the Melide causeway Porlezza, at the head of the lake in Italy The lake is in size, 63% of which is in Switzerland and 37% in Italy, has an average width of roughly , a maximum depth of found in the northern basin. The culminating point of the lake's drainage basin is the Pizzo di Gino summit in the Lugano Prealps (). Bathing in the lake is allowed at any of the 50 or so bathing establishments located along the Swiss shores. (in Italian) The Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia and parts of the waters of the lake are considered by European Customs Law as non-territorial for fiscal purposes and as such enjoy a special tax status as a duty-free area, exemption from EU VAT See Article 4 and offer residents other advantageous tax privileges. The Melide causeway separates the northern () and southern () basins, although a bridge in the causeway permits water flow and navigation. The lake retention time is an average of 8.2 years; that of the northern basin (11.9 years) is considerably higher than the southern one (2.3 years). Places on the lake in Switzerland (CH) and in Italy (I) include (from Lugano, clockwise): Navigation One of SNL's passenger boats arriving at Gandria The lake is navigable, and used by a considerable number of private vessels. Passenger boats of the Societ√† Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) provide services on the lake, principally for tourist purposes, but also connecting Lugano with other lakeside communities, some of which have no road access. Fishery in the lake (and Lake Maggiore) is regulated by a 1986 agreement between Switzerland and Italy. The current agreement on navigation dates from 1992. Pollution Pollution has long been a problem in Lake Lugano. In the 1960s and 1970s it was officially forbidden to bathe in the lake. Despite the continued introduction of sewage treatment plants such as in Gandria, factors such as lake retention time and lack of oxygen and increasing phosphorus concentrations means it is unclear if the lake will recover. The Federal Office for the Environment's last published report on Lake Lugano dates from 1995. To summarise that report: * at that time measurements indicated some improvement, but this was unlikely to continue at the same pace * there were almost permanent polluted layers at the bottom of the very deep lake * oxygen was scarce and could not be found below depth * as a result phosphorus levels were increasing at this depth * phosphorus levels in the northern basin were six times too high and in the southern basin twice too high * will take many decades to clean * the lake could be said to be \\"chronically sick\\" * in the Italian part of the lake only 20% of the population were connected to sewage treatment plants with phosphorus filters (not that all Swiss areas were connected either). The Swiss-Italian organisation CIPAIS in its most recent published report says: The Italian environmental group Legambiente, in its 2007 study of all northern Italian lakes,North Italy lakes are heavily polluted \\"State of Lake Lugano\\", Die Welt (translated), 3 August 2007, accessed March 31, 2011. found Lake Lugano to be the most polluted of all. According to Legambiente, the only reason swimming was not banned on the Italian Lakes was because the state of Lombardy changed the law. They state that pollution levels in the lakes do not conform to European rulings and the lack of sewage treatment is illegal. Their 2010 measurements\\"Monitoring data on the lakes Maggiore, Lugano, Varese\\" Legambiente, 2010, accessed March 31, 2011. found samples taken at Ponte Tresa, Ostene and Port Ceresio to be \\"heavily polluted\\" (more than 1,000 UFC/100 ml intestinal enterococci and/or greater than 2000 UFC/100 ml E. coli). Fauna Swan in Porlezza, Italy The lake is full of fish. Apart from a few protected areas, such as the mouth of the River Cuccio in Porlezza, fishing is allowed anywhere, although according to various regulations. Protected species are the bleak and the white clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). The bleak is almost extinct here, unlike in Lago Maggiore, and planning is under way for the controlled repopulation of the lake, particularly around Ponte Tresa. In 1895 the brook trout was introduced from Lake Zug, while between 1894 and 1897 the common whitefish was introduced. Since 1950 attempts have been made to introduce the whitefish Coregonus macrophthalmus from Lake Neuch√¢tel, but it has not established itself effectively. The Common Roach is present in large numbers and took around ten years to colonise the entire lake, thereby replacing the bleak. Still present are the European chub, tench, carp and a few examples of European perch, largemouth bass, zander and burbot. Recently the wels catfish and pigo have been spotted. Fossils The whole area behind the southern shores of Lake Lugano is rich in fossils. The focal point of these fossil deposits is Monte San Giorgio, where since the 19th century many fossils have been found dating from the mid-Triassic (around 220 million years ago). The deposits on Monte San Giorgio stretch towards the west into Italian territory and the deposits of Besano. Fossils dating from the early Jurassic (around 180 million years ago) have also been found along the southern shores but more towards the east and Osteno.

They are often combined with a marketing information system, in which case they are often called CRM systems. An SFA, typically a part of a company's CRM system, is a system that automatically records all the stages in a sales process. SFA includes a contact management system which tracks all contact that has been made with a given customer, the purpose of the contact, and any follow up that may be needed. This ensures that sales efforts are not duplicated, reducing the risk of irritating customers. SFA also includes a sales lead tracking system, which lists potential customers through paid phone lists, or customers of related products. Other elements of an SFA system can include sales forecasting, order management and product knowledge. More developed SFA systems have features where customers can actually model the product to meet their needs through online product building systems. This is becoming popular in the automobile industry, where patrons can customize various features such as color and interior features such as leather vs. upholstered seats. An integral part of any SFA system is company-wide integration among different departments. If SFA systems aren't adopted and properly integrated to all departments, there might be a lack of communication which could result in different departments contacting the same customer for the same purpose. In order to mitigate this risk, SFA must be fully integrated in all departments that deal with customer service management. Making a dynamic sales force links strategy and operational actions that can take place within a department. the SFA relies on objectives, plans, budget, and control indicators under specific conditions. In order to perform the objectives correctly, specific procedures must be implemented: Identifiable sales force management processes * Setting targets and objectives based on inputs (usually via a command center) * Assigning factors responsible for achieving objectives * Control processes for ensuring objectives are being achieved within ** a given time frame ** a given constrained context (customers and/or markets) * System management to handle uncertain environments The process usually starts with specific sales targets. The command center analyzes the inputs and outputs established from a modeled control process and the sales force. The control process enables the sales force to establish performance standards, measuring actual performance, comparing measured performance against established standards and taking corrective action. The sales managers adjust their actions based on the overall process. Aside from the control process, the following metrics are implemented: * Time management ‚Äì Accurately measures the tasks and the fraction of time needed for each task. * Call management ‚Äì Plan for customer interaction accounts for the fraction of command center reps that comply with the process and have successful calls. * Opportunity management ‚Äì If the process is followed correctly then a sales opportunity exists. The fraction of command center reps that use the tools, comply with the objective are all measured. * Account management ‚Äì For multiple opportunities with a customer the account is measured by the tools, process, and objectives. * Territory management ‚Äì For monitoring the account, the territory is measured by the number of account reps and prospective versus active customers. * Sales force management ‚Äì Process includes training, IT systems, control, coaching, and is shared across several people and departments. Five major activities are involved in staffing a sales force. They must be divided into related steps. The first step is to plan the recruiting and selection process. The responsibilities associated with this step are generally assigned to top sales executives, the field sales manager or the human resources manager. pg. 131-132 The company wants to determine the number and type of people needed, which involves analyzing the market and the job and preparing a written job description. The qualifications of the job must be established to fill the job. Second, the recruiting phase includes identifying sources of recruits that are consistent with the type of person desired, selecting the source to be used and contacting the recruits. You need to weigh out the options and evaluate its potential effectiveness versus its costs. Third, select the most qualified applicants. The selection phase has three steps, in the planning phase there may be qualifications specified and in the first step it is necessary to design a system for measuring the recruits against the standards from the planning phase. Then the system must be put into effect with the new applicants and then making the actual selection is the final step. The fourth activity is to hire those people who have been selected. Just because one makes an offer does not mean that the job is done. One must convince a recruit that the job offers everything that they need and want to get them to join a company or at least consider it. The fifth activity is to assimilate the new hires into the company. This is done by placing them under direction of an employee in the firm and possibly giving them a mentor to help them feel comfortable working in the firm and going through the training programs.  Components of sales-force automation systems  Sales-force automation systems vary in their capabilities. They can vary depending on what information an organization needs. The application also has implications based on an organization's size, organization rollup, demand of new system, sales processes, and number of users. Depending on requirements, services can fall into one of two categories: # on-premises software # on- demand (hosted) software With on-premises software, the customer manages and purchases the application. On-premises software has some advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage of on-premises is the higher cost of the software, along with maintenance. Customization is also needed for some who use additional processes outside of the normal out of the box solution. Time is also a factor. Many on-premises software implementations take longer - along with numerous testing and training sessions. The overall advantage of on-premises software relates to overall return on investment. Using the application for three to five years becomes more cost-effective. Another advantage may depend on the amount of data. With on-demand, certain volume restrictions hold, but with on-premises, data restrictions are based on the storage size of local hardware. CRM is a mechanism which manages all the data of their customers, clients and other business partners in a single container. CRM with cloud computing allows businesses to keep stature of its customers from all its corners. Several tools can aid in automating sales activities. The largest vendors are Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, SAP AG and Oracle. Mobile sales force automation application Many sales managers are always on the go. The growth of smartphones has reignited the creation of mobile sales force automation systems. Most companies IT departments are aware that adopting new abilities requires extensive testing. Despite the time needed to test such a new product, it will pay off in the future for the sales department. Smartphones appeal to salespeople because they are easy to carry and easy to use, show an appealing interface design, touchscreens and fast wireless network abilities. More than 55% of global 2000 organization will deploy mobile SFA project by 2011 and newer Smartphone platforms, such as Apple's iOS and Google's Android, point to a future of increasing diversity in device selecting and support for sales force.http://my.gartner.com/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID;=260&mode;=2&PageID;=3460702&resId;=1013325&ref;=QuickSearch&sthkw;=SALES+FORCE+AUTOMATION When implementing the mobile sales force automation application or during the first stage of systems development life cycle, project teams will need to evaluate how prospective solutions comprising mobile devices, software and support infrastructure and carrier services are packaged to deliver optimal system usability, manageability and integrative abilities, as well as scalability, reliability and performance. Advantages =Marketing manager= * Understanding the economic structure of an industry * Identifying segments within a market * Identifying a target market * Identifying the best customers in place * Doing marketing research to develop profiles (demographic, psychographic, and behavioral) of core customers * Understanding competitors and their products * Developing new products * Establishing environmental scanning mechanisms to detect opportunities and threats * Understanding one's company's strengths and weaknesses * Auditing customers' experience of a brand in * Developing marketing strategies for each of one's products using the marketing mix variables of price, product, distribution, and promotion * Coordinating the sales function with other parts of the promotional mix, such as advertising, sales promotion, public relations, and publicity * Creating a sustainable competitive advantage * Understanding where brands should be in the future, and providing an empirical basis to write marketing plans regularly to help get there * Providing input into feedback systems to help monitor and adjust the process =Strategic= Sales force automation systems can also create competitive advantage: * As mentioned above, productivity can increase. Sales staff can use their time more efficiently and effectively. The sales manager can become more efficient and effective (see above). This increased productivity can create a competitive advantage in three ways: it can reduce costs, it can increase sales revenue, and it can increase market share. * Field sales staff can send their information more often. Typically information can be sent to management after each sales call, rather than daily or weekly. This provides management with current information, which they can use while it is more valuable. Management response time can be greatly reduced. The company can become more alert and agile. * These systems could increase customer satisfaction if they are used with wisdom. If the information obtained and analyzed with the system is used to create a product that matches or exceeds customer expectations, and the sales staff use the system to service customers more expertly and diligently, then customers should be more satisfied with the company. This can provide a competitive advantage because customer satisfaction leads to increased customer loyalty, reduced customer acquisition costs, reduced price elasticity of demand, and increased profit margins. Disadvantages The major disadvantages in Sales Force Management Systems are: * Difficulty in adopting the system * Too much time spent on Data Entry * Losing personal touch in the process of automation * Laborious process of continuous maintenance, information updating, information cleansing and system upgrades * Cost involved in Sales Force Automation Systems and Maintenance * Difficulty in integration with other management information systems Encouraging use Many organisations have found it difficult to persuade sales people to enter data into the system. For this reason many have questioned the value of the investment. Recent developments have embedded sales process systems that give something back to the seller within the CRM screens.

He was able to defeat Tyrone at the Battle of Kinsale, and captured his headquarters at Dungannon before peace was agreed at the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. Early life The second son of James, 6th Baron Mountjoy and Catherine, only daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh (Commissioner for Suppression of the Monasteries), Charles Blount was among the most distinguished of the family, succeeding as 8th Baron Mountjoy on the death of his unmarried elder brother William, 7th Baron Mountjoy. The good fortune of his youthful and handsome looks found favour with Queen Elizabeth I which aroused the jealousy of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, leading to a duel between the two courtiers, who later became close friends. Charles Blount was returned to the Commons as MP for St Ives, Cornwall in 1584 and for Bere Alston in 1586 and 1593, before entering the House of Lords in 1594. Between 1586 and 1598 Charles spent most of his time on the Continent, serving in the Netherlands and Brittany. He joined Lord Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh in their expedition to the Azores in 1597, along with his distant cousin, Sir Christopher Blount. (Sir Christopher had married Essex's mother, Lettice Knollys, Dowager Countess of Leicester, and he was afterwards executed for complicity in Essex's treason.)  Ireland  The downfall of Lord Essex did no damage to Lord Mountjoy's career. After the failure of his rebellion, Essex shocked many by denouncing his sister Penelope, who was Mountjoy's mistress, as a traitor, which inevitably raised the question of his own possible involvement; but the Crown, anxious to retain Mountjoy's services, and also to show as much leniency as possible to the defeated rebels, simply ignored the accusation. On 24 February 1600 Mountjoy landed in Ireland as Lord Deputy following Lord Essex and in the ensuing years brought the Nine Years' War to an end. The leader of the rebellion, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, wrote about Mountjoy's \\"refined manners\\" that he would lose a whole season of campaigning \\"while waiting until breakfast is prepared to his mind!\\". Despite this Mountjoy proved that he was quite qualified to pursue the war. In early 1600, Mountjoy had dispatched Sir Henry Docwra with an army of 4,200 troops to land at Culmore to erect a fortress commanding the shores of Lough Foyle in the north- west of Ulster. To prevent Hugh O'Neill from sending a strong force to repulse Dowcra's forces, Mountjoy advanced in force from Dublin to Newry causing O'Neill to fear a southern advance into Tyrone. Mountjoy aimed to avoid the mistakes of previous Lord-Deputies. After the Battle of Moyry Pass, he had it cleared and a garrison establish there. It had long been a problem for English forces advancing into Ulster from the south. He also established posts with garrisons at Mountnorris and Armagh. On 13 July 1601, Mountjoy with his army along with Turlough MacHenry O'Neill of the Fews who had recently switched to the English side in the war, had a stand-off with Hugh O'Neill's forces at the River Blackwater. After a few shots in vain from either side, O'Neill's forces withdrew and Mountjoy sent his forces to occupy the ruined Blackwater fort destroyed by O'Neill in 1595. Later O'Neill's forces attacked Mountjoy's camp before withdrawing. In response the Lord-Deputy sent his forces across the river where they found strong artificially fortified fords, which would have held out against the English. By 15 July 1601, the Lord-Deputy had secured the surrender of O'Neill's ally Magennis. That month, Mountjoy had a new fort near the old Blackwater fort erected. Mountjoy reported to the council in England that O'Neill was determined to prevent his forces from advancing into Tyrone and towards Dungannon. As such he initiated a policy of burning large quantities of corn to induce a famine to drive the rebels out of their strongholds. Mountjoy set about trying to entice Hugh's forces to come out and attack by fetching some materials for the new fort from the Tyrone side of the river as well as to burn more corn. Further skirmishes between Mountjoy and O'Neill's forces ensued during the summer of 1601. Spanish forces had landed in Munster in August 1601 forcing Mountjoy to send his forces southwards leaving O'Neill remaining in his unbroken heartland of Tyrone. The Spanish arrival culminated in the Battle of Kinsale that December, which saw a major defeat of the rebels and their allies. O'Neill during this time had also moved south to assist some of his allies, however after some serious defeats at the hands of the forces of the Earl of Clanricarde of Connacht, he was in no place to offer any effective resistance once Mountjoy marched once more to Tyrone in the summer of 1602. Mountjoy advanced to the location he found the previous summer at the River Blackwater, which commanded safe and secure passage into Tyrone, previously inaccessible, and set about erecting a new fort. O'Neill having observed this burnt his capital at Dungannon and fled to his last refuge in Glenconkeyne. Advancing northwards through Tyrone, Mountjoy erected a fort in the townland of Magheralamfield, afterwards known as Mountjoy Castle. He also Christened the new fort at the Blackwater Charlemont Fort after himself. Once in Tyrone, Mountjoy carried out a campaign of devastation throughout it resulting in the mass hunting of rebels, spoiling of corn, the burning of houses and the killing of churls so to force the submission of O'Neill and his remaining allies. Most symbolically Mountjoy had the inauguration site of the O'Neill's at Tullyhogue Fort destroyed. On 30 March 1603, six days after the death of Elizabeth and the accession of James I, O'Neill made peace with Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Mountjoy continued in office with the more distinguished title of Lord-Lieutenant (1603-1604). He declared an amnesty for the rebels and granted them honourable terms, which caused some severe criticism from England.Berleth, p. 293 He showed similar moderation in putting down the abortive risings in Cork and Wexford, where the aldermen, apparently with some vague idea of gaining greater toleration for Roman Catholics, refused to proclaim the new King: in Cork three insurgents were hanged after a summary trial, but the rest were acquitted or pardoned. As part of the Plantation of Ulster, the majority of the barony of Loughinsholin was detached from County Tyrone and made part of the newly created County Londonderry. The rest of Loughinsholin along with the northern parts of Dungannon barony were merged to create the short-lived barony of Mountjoy. It would later be amalgamated with the barony of Dungannon. Later life On his return to England, Lord Mountjoy served as one of Sir Walter Raleigh's judges in 1603, and in the same year King James I appointed him Master of the Ordnance as well as creating him Earl of Devonshire, granting him extensive estates. He was one of the founder members of the Spanish Company re-founded by royal charter in 1605.As listed in text of 1605 Charter as \\"Charles, Earl of Devonshire\\": Croft, Pauline, The Spanish Company, London Record Society, Volume 9, London, 1973 Mountjoy's long-term successor in Ireland was Sir Arthur Chichester. Ireland remained in a state of some tension, with a number of disgruntled Gaelic Irish allies of the Crown angered by Mountjoy's generous terms to the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell which meant land that had been promised to them had now been restored to the earls. In 1607, a year after Mountjoy's death, the flight of the Earls took place. The following year a former government ally Sir Cahir O'Doherty attacked and burned Derry, launching O'Doherty's Rebellion. The flight and the rebellion led to the Plantation of Ulster, something that had not been envisaged by Mountjoy when he had made peace in 1603. Marriage Towards the end of his life, on 26 December 1605 at Wanstead House near London, in a ceremony conducted by his chaplain William Laud, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, he married his long-time mistress Lady Penelope (died 7 July 1607), formerly wife of Robert, 3rd Baron Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick) and sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. After the execution of her brother in 1601, Lord Rich divorced her in the ecclesiastical courts. The marriage was carried out in defiance of canon law, and resulted in the disgrace of both parties, who were banished from King James I's court circles. The Earl and Countess of Devonshire continued to live together as husband and wife with their illegitimate children until his death a few months later in the following year. Illegitimate progeny His illegitimate children by his mistress Lady Rich, of whom he acknowledged the paternity, included: *Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport (1597‚Äì1663) *Elizabeth Blount *St John Blount *Ruth Blount (1600‚Äì1694) Legacy Lord Devonshire left no legitimate children, and so his hereditary titles became extinct at his death on 3 April 1606 at Savoy House, London.

H. Abrams defined allusion as \\"a brief reference, explicit or indirect, to a person, place or event, or to another literary work or passage\\". (Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms 1971, s.v. \\"Allusion\\"). It is left to the audience to make the direct connection.H.W. Fowler, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a reference. In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new meanings and denotations. It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate. Literary allusion is closely related to parody and pastiche, which are also \\"text-linking\\" literary devices.Ben-Porot (1976) pp. 107‚Äì8 quotation: In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as \\"In the stock market, he met his Waterloo.\\" Scope of the term Backside of a clay tablet from Pylos bearing the motif of the Labyrinth, an allusion to the mythological fight of Theseus and the Minotaur In the most traditional sense, allusion is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in film or the visual arts.Preminger & Brogan (1993) The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics. Princeton University Press. In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an homage. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. \\"Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation\\", William Irwin observed, in asking \\"What is an allusion?\\"Irwin, \\"What Is an Allusion?\\" Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 59 (2001) Without the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. Allusion is an economical device, a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their cultural literacy. Allusion as cultural bond The origin of allusion is from the Latin noun allusionem \\"a playing with, a reference to,\\" from alludere \\"to play, jest, make fun of,\\" a compound of ad \\"to\\" + ludere \\"to play.\\" Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a \\"cultivation of intimacy\\" to be an essential element of many jokes.(Cohen, Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters [University of Chicago Press] 1999:28f). Irwin 2001:note 8 noted the parallel. Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because \\"it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent.\\"Irwin 2001:288 The allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions‚Äîcoincidences that a critic might not find illuminating. Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics. William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: \\"If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible.\\" Irwin appends a note: \\"Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text.\\"Irwin 2001:289 and note 22. This is the basis for Christian readings of Old Testament prophecy, which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in . Allusion differs from the similar term intertextuality in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part. The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience \\"getting\\" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a private language (e.g. \\"Ulalume\\", by Edgar Allan Poe). Academic analysis of the concept of allusions In discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil's Georgics, R. F. ThomasR. F. Thomas, \\"Virgil's Georgics and the art of reference\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 90 (1986) pp 171‚Äì98. distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are: # Casual reference, \\"the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense\\" that is relatively unimportant to the new context; # Single reference, in which the hearer or reader is intended to \\"recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation\\"; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of \\"making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety\\"; # Self-reference, where the locus is in the poet's own work; # Corrective allusion, where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions; # Apparent reference \\"which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention\\"; and # Multiple reference or conflation, which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions. A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock or T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land. Examples In Homer, brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the Calydonian boarhunt. In Hellenistic Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed literary canon known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of Callimachus offer the best-known examples. Martin Luther King, Jr., alluded to the Gettysburg Address in starting his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech by saying 'Five score years ago...\\"; his hearers were immediately reminded of Abraham Lincoln's \\"Four score and seven years ago\\", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details. A sobriquet is an allusion. By metonymy one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, \\"the city that never sleeps\\" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York. An allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere clich√©, as is seen in some of the sections below. =15 minutes of fame= Andy Warhol, a 20th-century American artist most famous for his pop-art images of Campbell soup cans and of Marilyn Monroe, commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, \\"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\\" Today, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, they are said to be experiencing their \\"15 minutes of fame\\"; that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark. =Lot's Wife/Pillar of Salt= According to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience. An allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once they have begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command. =Cassandra= In Greek mythology, Cassandra, the daughter of Trojan king Priam, was loved by Apollo, who gave her the gift of prophecy. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them. Today, a \\"Cassandra\\" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded. =Catch-22= This phrase comes from a novel by Joseph Heller. Catch-22 is set on a U.S. Army Air Force base in World War II. \\"Catch-22\\" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions. Later in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means \\"They can do whatever they want to do.\\" This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. In common speech, \\"catch-22\\" has come to describe any absurd or no-win situation. =T. S. Eliot= The poetry of T. S. Eliot is often described as \\"allusive\\", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher. =James Joyce= The most densely allusive work in modern English may be Finnegans Wake by James Joyce. Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson wrote A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.

He was a member of the North Carolina delegation at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and led the efforts for North Carolina to ratify the Constitution in 1789 at Fayetteville. He then served as the only governor of the Southwest Territory and played a leading role in helping the territory gain admission to the Union as the State of Tennessee. He was selected as one of Tennessee's initial United States Senators in 1796.Terry Weeks, \\"William Blount,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2010. Accessed 10 September 2012. Born to a prominent North Carolina family, Blount served as a paymaster during the American Revolutionary War. He was elected to the North Carolina legislature in 1781, where he remained in one role or another for most of the decade, except for two terms in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1786. Blount pushed efforts in the legislature to open the lands west of the Appalachians to settlement. As governor of the Southwest Territory, he negotiated the Treaty of Holston in 1791, bringing thousands of acres of Indian lands under U.S. control. An aggressive land speculator, Blount gradually acquired millions of acres in Tennessee and the Trans-Appalachian West. His risky land investments left him in debt, and in the 1790s, he conspired with Great Britain to seize the Spanish-controlled Louisiana in the hope of boosting western land prices. When the conspiracy was uncovered in 1797, he was expelled from the Senate and became the first federal official to face impeachment.\\"To Arrest an Impeached Senator.\\" United States Senate website. Accessed 10 September 2012. However, Blount remained popular in Tennessee and served in the state senate during the last years of his life. Early life Blount was born on Easter Sunday at Rosefield, the home of his maternal grandfather, John Gray, near Windsor in Bertie County, North Carolina.William Masterson, William Blount (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1954). He was the eldest child of Jacob Blount (1726‚Äì1789) and Barbara Gray Blount. The Blounts had gradually risen to prominence in the first half of the 18th century as William's grandfather and father had steadily built the family fortune. In the years following William's birth, Jacob Blount built a plantation, Blount Hall, in Pitt County, North Carolina. Blount Hall, childhood home of William Blount Outside of tutors, William and his brothers had little formal education but were involved in their father's business ventures at a young age. Jacob Blount raised livestock, cotton and tobacco, produced turpentine, and operated a mill and horse racing track for the local community. His land acquisitions, consisting of several thousand acres by the end of the 1760s, taught his sons the profit potential of aggressive land speculation. During the Regulator Movement of the late 1760s and early 1770s, the Blounts remained loyal to the North Carolina government. Jacob Blount, a justice of the peace, furnished Governor William Tryon's army with supplies as it marched to defeat the Regulators at the Battle of Alamance in 1771. William Blount, along with his brothers Jacob and John Gray Blount, were among Tryon's soldiers, though they saw little action. American Revolution Reading Blount As tensions heightened between Britain and the American colonies in the 1770s, the Blount family gradually aligned themselves with the Patriot cause. In April 1776, Jacob Blount was appointed paymaster of the 2nd North Carolina Regiment, and William Blount was appointed paymaster for the New Bern District Brigade of the North Carolina militia the following month. William's brothers, Reading and Thomas Blount, accepted commissions in the Continental Army. The Blounts provided provisions for the Colonial army and militias, and they profited both financially and politically from the war. They also began looking westward, with John Gray Blount acquiring a portion of Richard Henderson's Transylvania Purchase in mid-1776. In December 1776, William Blount was appointed paymaster of the 3rd North Carolina Regiment and spent the first few months of 1777 with the unit as it marched north to join George Washington's main forces in the defense of Philadelphia. In November 1777, political rivals in the North Carolina legislature removed Blount as paymaster, though he was restored to the office in April 1778. He helped organize regiments for the defense of Charleston, which fell to the British in 1780 as a result of the Siege of Charleston. William's brother, Thomas, was captured during its fall. In early 1780, Blount was appointed official commissary to General Horatio Gates, who had arrived in North Carolina to command southern colonial forces. Blount was present at Gates's defeat at the Battle of Camden in August 1780, and in the confusion of the battle, lost $300,000 of soldiers' pay. North Carolina politics and the Continental Congress Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States Key, William Blounty, No 18 In late 1779, Blount ran for the vacant New Bern state House of Commons seat against Richard Dobbs Spaight in a campaign described by Blount's biographer, William Masterson, as \\"violent in an age of fierce elections.\\" Spaight won by a narrow margin, but Blount successfully convinced election officials that voter fraud had occurred, and the election was voided. In the weeks following the Battle of Camden, Blount again ran for the seat, and this time was successful. He took his seat in the House of Commons in January 1781. In May 1782, Blount was elected one of North Carolina's four delegates to the Continental Congress. At the Congress's 1782 session, Blount helped defeat a poll tax and a liquor tax, and opposed a reduction of the army. He also agreed to consider a land cession act to satisfy North Carolina's massive tax debt owed to the Confederation. Blount left Philadelphia in January 1783 and resigned from the Congress three months later to accept an appointment to the North Carolina House of Commons steering committee. During the House's 1783 and 1784 sessions, Blount introduced several bills that would prove critical in the early history of what is now Tennessee. One bill, known as the \\"Land Grab Act,\\" opened the state's lands west of the Appalachians (i.e., the parts of Tennessee not under Indian domain) to settlement. One individual who took advantage of this act was militia captain James White, who acquired a tract of land that would later become Knoxville, Tennessee. Another bill rendered soldiers with at least two years of military service eligible for land grants. Some soldiers used their grants to acquire land in the Tennessee Valley, while others sold their grants to the Blounts and other land speculators. In 1784, Blount sponsored a bill establishing the city of Nashville in what was then the Cumberland settlements. In June 1784, Blount sponsored another bill critical to early Tennessee history‚Äîa bill calling for North Carolina lands west of the Appalachians (i.e., modern Tennessee) to be ceded to the Continental Congress to satisfy the state's share of the nation's tax burden. The bill was hotly contested but passed by a 52-43 margin. Opponents of the cession gained control of the House and repealed the act in October, but not before a movement by the Tennessee Valley residents to establish a separate state, known as the State of Franklin, had gained momentum. A friend of both North Carolina Governor Richard Caswell and Franklinite leader John Sevier, Blount waffled on the Franklin issue for the next four years. In spite of the cession debacle, Blount was elected to the Continental Congress for the 1785 session. As he prepared to depart, however, word came that the Congress had appointed a commission to negotiate a new treaty, eventually known as the Treaty of Hopewell, with the southern tribes. Fearing the new treaty would be unfavorable to North Carolina, Blount, with Governor Caswell's blessing, headed south in hopes of negotiating a separate treaty for the state. He arrived too late, however, and the Hopewell Treaty negotiated by the commissioners returned a sizeable portion of western lands claimed by North Carolina speculators to the Indians. Fearing a backlash back home, Blount merely signed the treaty as a witness. In March 1786, Blount hurried to New York to take his seat in the Continental Congress, hoping to prevent ratification of the Hopewell Treaty, but once again arrived too late, and the treaty was ratified. Disappointed, he went home, but with anger rising over his handling of the Hopewell Treaty, he returned to the Continental Congress in November 1786. In 1787, he was a candidate for president of the Congress, but Arthur St. Clair was chosen instead. In March 1787, Blount was chosen as one of five delegates to represent North Carolina at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Blount arrived at the convention on June 20, after debates had already begun.James Madison, Gaillard Hund and James Brown Scott (eds.), Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention (Oxford University Press, 1920). Accessed at the Yale University Avalon Project website, 11 September 2012. He sent Caswell a copy of the Virginia Plan (in violation of Convention rules), and, expressing pessimism in the Convention's outcome, he stayed for just a few days before heading to New York to rejoin the Continental Congress in early July. He was present for the Congress's debate and passage of the Northwest Ordinance, and heard Henry Knox's report recommending a North Carolina land cession. By August 7, however, he had returned to the Convention in Philadelphia for final debates. Still reeling from the fallout from the Hopewell Treaty, he was wary of signing the final document, but was finally convinced by Gouverneur Morris to do so. Confident that North Carolina would gain more than it would lose with the new Constitution, Blount returned home to campaign for its ratification. Elected to the North Carolina Senate from Pitt County in 1788 and 1789, Blount and his allies successfully countered attempts by anti-federalists Willie Jones and William Lenoir to thwart adoption of the new Constitution, and North Carolina voted for its ratification in November 1789. On December 1, the state legislature voted to cede its trans-Appalachian lands to the new federal government. Blount sought one of North Carolina's inaugural U.S. Senate seats in November 1789 but was defeated by Benjamin Hawkins. Southwest Territory Blount Mansion, home of William Blount in Knoxville, built in the early 1790s Congress accepted North Carolina's western cession, which consisted of what is now Tennessee, on April 2, 1790. In May, the Southwest Territory was created from the new cession and was to be governed under the Northwest Ordinance. On June 8, President George Washington appointed Blount governor of the new territory. Blount visited Washington at Mount Vernon on September 18 and was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice James Iredell two days later. In October 1790, he set up a temporary capital at William Cobb's house, Rocky Mount, in what is now Piney Flats, Tennessee, and began organizing a government for the new territory.Walter Durham, \\"The Southwest Territory: Progression to Statehood,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, Vol. 62 (1990), p. 7. The western frontiersmen were initially skeptical of Blount, who came across as an aristocratic easterner. Blount managed to gain their trust, however, by recommending John Sevier and James Robertson as brigadier generals of the territorial militia, and appointing Landon Carter, Stockley Donelson and Gilbert Christian as colonels. Former Franklinites appointed to lower government offices included Joseph Hardin, William Cage, James White, Dr. James White and Francis Alexander Ramsey. Others receiving appointments included future president Andrew Jackson, future governor Archibald Roane and naval officer George Farragut. Blount hired his half-brother, Willie Blount, as a personal secretary, and recruited Fayetteville, North Carolina, publisher George Roulstone to establish a newspaper for the new territory, known as the Gazette. In December 1790, following his trip to the Cumberland territories, Blount's family joined him at Rocky Mount. The following year, he chose James White's Fort, near the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers, as the territory's new capital. He named the capital \\"Knoxville\\" after his superior, the United States Secretary of War Henry Knox. Following the initial sale of lots in October 1791, he began construction of his mansion in the new city. Portrait of Blount by Albert Rosenthal Throughout his term as governor, Blount was torn between angry western frontiersmen, who demanded war against hostile Indians, and a War Department that consistently pushed for peaceful negotiations with the Indians. In June 1791, he negotiated the Treaty of Holston with Cherokee leader John Watts and several other chiefs, resolving land claims south of the French Broad and obtaining permission for a permanent road between the territory's eastern settlements and the Cumberland settlements. In spite of this treaty, Chickamauga attacks increased the following year. Frustrated settlers demanded federal troops intervene, but the War Department refused, blaming settlers for intruding on Indian lands. William Cocke, an ex-Franklinite, blamed Blount for the lack of action against the Chickamaugas and began publishing attacks against Blount in the Gazette. Blount responded with a series of articles (published under pseudonyms) rejecting Cocke and calling for patience. Following attacks by the Chickamaugas against Ziegler's Station in 1792 and against Cavet's Station in 1793, however, Blount was unable to contain the rage of frontiersmen, and called up the militia. Sevier led the militia south into Georgia and attacked and destroyed several Chickamauga villages. Knox blasted Blount for the invasion and refused to issue pay for the militiamen. Blount finally negotiated a truce with the Chickamauga at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1794. Toward the middle of his term, Blount began implementing the steps stipulated in the Northwest Ordinance for a territory to gain statehood. One of these steps was to call for the election of a legislature and submit nominees for appointments to a territorial council, which Blount did in 1794. On September 15, 1795, he directed county sheriffs to conduct a census. The census placed the territory's population at 77,000, substantially more than the 60,000 required for statehood. Blount ordered a state constitutional convention to be held at Knoxville in January 1796, which he personally attended as part of the Knox County delegation. The government of the new state, Tennessee, convened in late March 1796, before it had been officially admitted to the Union. Blount realized he had little chance of defeating Sevier in a race for governor of the new state, so he instead sought one of the state's two United States Senate seats. He received this appointment (along with William Cocke) on March 30, 1796, and headed to Philadelphia to campaign for Tennessee's statehood. Blount's brother, Thomas (then a Congressman from North Carolina), along with James Madison, convinced the house to vote for Tennessee's admission to the Union on May 6. The Senate voted to admit the new state on May 31. Blount Conspiracy Throughout the 1780s and 1790s, William Blount and his brothers gradually bought up large amounts of western lands, acquiring over 2.5 million acres by the mid-1790s. Much of this land was bought on credit, pushing the family deeply into debt. In 1795, the market for western lands collapsed, and land prices plummeted. A number of land speculators, including Blount associate David Allison, went bankrupt. Blount partnered with Philadelphia physician Nicholas Romayne in an attempt to sell land to English investors, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Compounding Blount's problems, Timothy Pickering, who despised Blount, replaced Henry Knox as Secretary of War in 1795. Following France's defeat of Spain in the War of the Pyrenees, land speculators, already on the financial brink, worried that the French would eventually gain control of Spanish-controlled Louisiana and shut off American access to the Mississippi River. In hopes of preventing this, Blount and his friend, a Native American agent named John Chisholm, concocted a plan to allow Britain to gain control of Florida and Louisiana, and in return give free access to both New Orleans and the Mississippi River to American merchants. The plan called for territorial militias, with the aid of the British fleet, to attack New Madrid, New Orleans, and Pensacola. To help carry out the plan, Blount recruited Romayne, who never showed more than lukewarm support for the idea, and a Knoxville merchant named James Carey. Chisholm, meanwhile, sailed to England to recruit British supporters. In April 1797, Carey was at the Tellico Blockhouse near Knoxville when he gave a government agent a letter from Blount outlining the conspiracy. The agent turned the letter over to his superior, Colonel David Henley in Knoxville, and Henley in turn sent it to Pickering (who had since become Secretary of State). Elated at the opportunity to crush Blount, Pickering turned the letter over to President John Adams. Determining that the actions of Blount, now a senator from Tennessee, constituted a crime, Adams sent Blount's letter to the Senate, where it was presented on July 3, 1797, while Blount was out for a walk. When Blount returned, the clerk read the contents of the letter aloud as Blount stood in stunned silence. Vice President Thomas Jefferson asked Blount if he had written the letter. Blount gave an evasive answer and asked that the matter be postponed until the following day, which was granted. On July 4, Blount refused to return to the Senate and had fellow Tennessee Senator William Cocke read a letter which again requested more time. The Senate rejected this request and formed an investigative committee. Ordered to testify before the committee, Blount initially attempted to flee by ship to North Carolina, but federal deputies seized the ship and most of his belongings. On July 7, Blount, after consulting with attorneys Alexander Dallas and Jared Ingersoll, testified before the committee and denied writing the letter. The following day, the House of Representatives voted 41 to 30 to hold impeachment hearings, and the Senate voted 25 to 1 to \\"sequester\\" Blount's seat, effectively expelling him, with Henry Tazewell casting the lone dissenting vote. Drawing depicting a brawl between congressmen Matthew Lyon and Roger Griswold, which took place at one of Blount's impeachment hearings in January 1798 Rather than await trial, Blount posted bail and fled to Tennessee. John Chisholm remained in England in a debtors' prison for several months and confessed the entire scheme upon his return. Romayne was arrested and forced to testify before the committee, where he confessed to his part in the conspiracy. The House continued to consider evidence for Blount's impeachment in early 1798. At one session on January 30, a bizarre brawl erupted between two congressmen, Matthew Lyon and Roger Griswold. Blount's trial in the Senate took place in January 1799, though Blount refused to attend, in spite of a visit to Knoxville from the Senate sergeant-at-arms. On January 11, 1799, the Senate voted 14 to 11 to dismiss the impeachment, arguing that impeachment did not extend to senators.William Eigelsbach, \\"The Blount Conspiracy: Notes of Samuel Sitgreaves on the Questioning of Dr. Nicholas Romayne On July 13 and 14, 1797, Before the House Impeachment Committee,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, Vol. 66 (1994), pp. 81‚Äì94. The unraveling of the conspiracy destroyed Blount's reputation at the national level and touched off a series of accusations between Federalists and Anti- federalists. George Washington called for swift justice against Blount and hoped he would be \\"held in detestation by all good men.\\"Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, The life and correspondence of James McHenry (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907). Abigail Adams called the conspiracy a \\"diabolical plot\\" and bemoaned the fact that there was no guillotine in Philadelphia. Pickering argued the conspiracy was part of a greater French plot and accused Thomas Jefferson of being involved. Oliver Wolcott suggested the conspiracy was an attempt to blackmail Spain. Later life Coat of Arms of William Blount While Blount's national reputation was ruined, he remained popular in Tennessee. Upon his return to Knoxville in September 1797, he was paraded triumphantly through the city by a military procession led by James White and James Stuart. Most of his old Tennessee allies, among them Andrew Jackson, Joseph Anderson, James White, Charles McClung and William C. C. Claiborne, remained loyal, and helped repair his image among locals. Blount, likewise, adopted a staunchly pro-western attitude. Graves of Blount and his wife, Mary, at the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Knoxville In 1798, Congress appointed commissioners to survey the boundary between U.S. and Cherokee lands set by the Treaty of Holston. Concerned the commissioners would run the boundary in a way that favored the Cherokee over the settlers, Blount and Sevier sent agents to harass the commissioners. To further push western interests, they sent representatives to federal treaty negotiations at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1798, frustrating federal negotiators sent by Congress and confusing Cherokee representatives. In his report on the Tellico treaty, one of the commissioners, Elisha Hall, accused Blount of trying to thwart the treaty, and Blount sued him for libel. After the suit was thrown out by Judge David Campbell, Blount sought Campbell's impeachment, calling him a \\"meddling blockhead.\\" In October 1798, William Blount was elected to Knox County's state senate seat, following James White's resignation. On December 3, he was named Speaker of the Senate. He spent his first few days in office pushing for Judge Campbell's impeachment. The House voted to impeach Campbell on December 17, but he was acquitted by the Senate on December 26. In March 1800, an epidemic swept through Knoxville, and several members of the Blount family fell ill. Blount was tending to his sick family when he, too, fell ill on March 11. After 10 days, he died on the night of March 21, 1800. He was buried at the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery a few blocks from his home in Knoxville. His half-brother, Willie, consolidated the family estate and took charge of the education of Blount's children.

He is also the former Bishop of Abuja (Nigeria's capital) and Archbishop of Province III, which covered the northern and central parts of the country. When the division into ecclesiastical provinces was adopted in 2002, he became the first Archbishop of Abuja Province, a position he held until 2010.Ecclesiastical Provinces and Dioceses of the Church of Nigeria He is married and a father of six. A \\"low church\\" Evangelical, Akinola emphasizes the Bible and the teachings of the apostles (apostolic tradition) in a particular way. As one of the leaders of the Global South within the Anglican Communion, Akinola has taken a firm stand against theological developments which he contends are incompatible with the biblical teachings of Christianity and orthodox Anglicanism, notably setting himself against any revisionist interpretations of the Bible and, in particular, opposing same-sex blessings, the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and any homosexual practice. He was a leading name of conservatives throughout the Anglican Communion, including the Convocation of Anglicans in North America.Telegraph.co.uk On 15 September 2009, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, aged 57 years old, of Bendel Province, was elected the Primate of Church of Nigeria at the conference of the House of Bishops in Umuahia. He succeeded Akinola on 25 March 2010. Biography Peter Akinola was born in 1944 to a Yoruba family in Abeokuta in southwestern Nigeria . His father died when he was four years old and due to financial pressures Akinola had to leave school early.BBC News: Profile: Archbishop Peter Akinola He learned carpentry and at twenty he had a successful furniture business and as patent-medicine seller. He had finished high school by distance education.Sarah Simpson, An African Archbishop Finds Common Ground in Virginia, Christian Science Monitor, 8 January 2007 He left his business, to study for the priesthood. He studied at a Nigerian Anglican seminary and was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1979 in the Anglican Church of Nigeria. Soon after ordination, he moved to the United States to study at the Virginia Theological Seminary, where he graduated in 1981 with a master's degree.Biography of Peter Akinola Returning to Nigeria afterwards, Akinola was assigned to create an Anglican presence in the new capital Abuja which was about to be built. He holds it one of his greatest successes to have created out of nothing a vibrant Anglican community there. In 1989 he was ordained bishop of Abuja and in 1997 archbishop of Province III of the Church of Nigeria, consisting of the northern dioceses of Nigeria. On 22 February 2000, he was elected primate of the Church of Nigeria, the second biggest church in the Anglican Communion, then numbering 18 million members. In 2002, he became Archbishop of the Abuja Province, a position he held until 2010. Akinola was given the National Award of Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON) in December 2003.Sagay, \\"From Carpenter to Primate\\", The Guardian, 1 October 2006 In 2006 Akinola appeared on TIME magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people in the category Leaders and Revolutionaries.The TIME 100 However, in 2007 TIME magazine suggested TIME magazine 8 March 2007 that he \\"has some explaining to do\\" in relation to his support for legislation Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Bill criminalising \\"gay... organizations\\" and \\"Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise\\". In 2007, the Nigerian newspaper ThisDay gave him together with 17 others a Lifetime Achievement Award, stating in its citation: \\"Called a bigot by some in the Anglican Church, his attitudes nonetheless represent a deep-rooted conservative tradition in African Christianity that is flourishing and growing.\\" National Champions, World Class Brands, TMCnet, 5. January 2007 But he has been criticised by other sections of the international press, including the right-leaning Daily Telegraph which in an editorial on 23 March 2007 characterised him as one of the \\"extremists\\" who had \\"hijacked\\" conservative Anglicanism, and as \\"a deeply divisive figure\\" who has \\"defended new Nigerian legislation that makes \\"cancerous\\" (his word) same-sex activity punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.\\" Akinola was at one time President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, an ecumenical body bringing together 52 million Protestant, Catholic, and African independent Christians. During his Presidency, the National Ecumenical Centre in Abuja was completed, which had been a building ruin for 16 years.National Ecumenical Centre dedicated in Abuja Akinola was voted out of his position as National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in June 2007, and replaced by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Nigeria, who polled 72 votes to Akinola's 33 votes. This followed criticism of Akinola's allegedly high handed leadership style and of his alleged failure to confront Nigerian President Obasanjo as other Christian leaders had.The Sun News On-line Subsequently, his candidacy as Vice President was rejected by the General Assembly of the Christian Association of Nigeria. In October 2009, he reacted to the Vatican's proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by saying that although he welcomed ecumenical dialogue and shared moral theology with the Catholic Church, the current GAFCON structures already meet the spiritual and pastoral needs of conservative Anglicans in Africa.A Pastoral Exhortation to the Faithful in the Anglican Communion In November 2009, Akinola signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience In 2010, upon his retirement as Primate of Nigeria, he launched the Peter Akinola Foundation, a \\"non-profit-making and non-governmental organisation that focuses on four main areas as Initiatives\\", respectively \\"Youth at Crossroad\\", \\"Mission and Evangelism\\", \\"Stand in the Gap\\" and \\"Anglican Unity and Self Reliance\\".Peter Akinola Foundation Official Website On 21 November 2015, Peter lost his Mother Janet Amoke Akinola. She was aged 100 years.  Church politics  = Vision of the Church of Nigeria = One of his first actions as primate was to get together 400 bishops, priests, lay members, and members of the Mothers' Union to elaborate a vision for the Church of Nigeria under chairman Ernest Shonekan, a former president of Nigeria.Vision of the Church of Nigeria The vision elaborated was: \\"The Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) shall be; bible-based, spiritually dynamic, united, disciplined, self supporting, committed to pragmatic evangelism, social welfare and a Church that epitomizes the genuine love of Christ.\\" Part of the program of actions were, e.g. * on central level ** translating the books of liturgy in further languages ** establishing a group of 3000 leading lay personalities who will take care of fundraising and relieve the bishops of this duty ** establish a legal support team to enforce the constitutional right of freedom of religion and worship ** establish colleges for theology and universities ** provide internet access for the dioceses * for each diocese ** training full- time itinerant evangelists ** on the job training for priests and their wives ** working out a social welfare program for less privileged people ** establish a hospital with at least 30 beds ** establish secondary schools * on community level ** literacy courses for adults ** set up cottage industries for the unemployed =Relations with the Anglican Communion= Archbishop Peter Akinola in his cope and mitre, traditional vestments. In August 2003 he stated that if the celibate homosexual Jeffrey John was consecrated as Bishop of Reading or the non-celibate homosexual Gene Robinson consecrated as Bishop of New Hampshire, the Church of Nigeria would leave the Anglican Communion. A number of dioceses throughout the world, including the Diocese of Sydney, made similar statements. Under pressure from the Archbishop of Canterbury, John withdrew from appointment as bishop and was subsequently appointed as Dean of St Albans. Gene Robinson's consecration went forward, precipitating a crisis in the Anglican Communion. At the end of 2003 Akinola commissioned together with Drexel Gomez, primate of the Church in the Province of the West Indies and Gregory Venables, Presiding Bishop of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone Claiming our Anglican Identity: The Case Against the Episcopal Church, USA, a paper for the Primates of the Anglican Communion detailing the implications of the consecration of Gene Robinson for the Anglican Communion, in the view of conservative Primates.Claiming our Anglican Identity: The Case Against the Episcopal Church, USA His first reaction on the Windsor Report 2004 was outspoken and critical,From Nigeria's Primate, Archbishop Peter Akinola: Statement on Windsor Report, 19 October 2004 but the statement from the Primates gathered at the first African Anglican Bishop's Conference, headed by Akinola, was more moderate and expressed commitment to the future of the Anglican Communion.Statement from the Primates gathered at the first African Anglican Bishop's Conference However, whilst strenuously supporting those parts of the Windsor Report which address the gay issue, he has not followed with those parts that deplore overseas interventions in the U.S. Church and has, on the contrary, set up a missionary body, the Convocation of Anglicans in North America, in order to formalise the ties between break-away Anglicans in the United States and the Church of Nigeria. In September 2005, Akinola spoke out against the Church in Brazil deposition of an Evangelical bishop and excommunication of over 30 priests. In September 2005, the Church of Nigeria redefined in its constitution its relationship to the Anglican Communion as \\"Communion with all Anglican Churches, Dioceses and Provinces that hold and maintain the Historic Faith, Doctrine, Sacrament and Discipline of the one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.\\".Canons of the Church of Nigeria In a later press release, Akinola clarified \\"We want to state that our intention in amending the 2002 Constitution of the Church of Nigeria was to make clear that we are committed to the historic faith once delivered to the Saints, practice and the traditional formularies of the Church. ... We treasure our place within the worldwide family of the Anglican Communion but we are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once. We have chosen not to be yoked to them as we prefer to exercise our freedom to remain faithful. We continue to pray, however, that there will be a genuine demonstration of repentance.\\" On 12 November 2005, Akinola signed a Covenant of Concordat with the Presiding Bishops of the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican Province of America. Akinola refused to take Holy Communion in company with the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, both at the Primates Meeting at Dromantine in 2005 and at the Primates Meeting at Dar es Salaam in 2007 and, on the latter occasion, he issued a press release in order to publicise and explain his refusal and that of others associated with him.Press release on refusal to share Holy Communion Akinola's name as chairman of the Global South Primates heads the list of signatories to a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury on 15 November 2005.Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury In this letter Europe is described as \\"a spiritual desert\\" and the actions of the Church of England in supporting the new civil partnerships laws are said to give \\"the appearance of evil\\". Three of the bishops whose names appeared on the document at the Global South website (President Bishop Clive Handford of Jerusalem and the Middle East, the Primate of the West Indies Archbishop Drexel Gomez, and the Presiding Bishop of the Southern Cone Bishop Gregory Venables) denied signing or approving the letter, and criticised it as \\"an act of impatience\\", \\"scandalous\\", and \\"megaphone diplomacy\\".Episcopal News Service Archives Akinola was among the Global South leaders who opposed the consecration of Gene Robinson, the first openly homosexual bishop in the Anglican Communion. This group successfully pressed for the voluntary withdrawal of ECUSA's representatives from the Anglican Consultative Council's meeting in Nottingham in 2005, although representatives did attend in order to make a presentation supporting full inclusion of gays and lesbians in the life of the Church, for which a vote of thanks was passed. In August 2005 he denounced a statement of the Church of England's House of Bishops on civil partnerships and called for the disciplining of the Church of England and ECUSA on the grounds that the Church has not changed its position on same-sex partnerships. Since the Anglican Communion has historically been defined as those Churches in communion with the See of Canterbury, whose Archbishop is head of the Church of England and thus primus inter pares in the Anglican Communion, this led to speculation that Akinola was positioning himself as a possible international leader of a more conservative church than the present Anglican Communion, which would no longer recognise the authority or primacy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, he attended the subsequent Primates Meeting in Tanzania in 2007, although he absented himself from all the celebrations of Holy Communion during that meeting. In May 2007 he flew to the United States to install Martyn Minns, a priest who had left the Episcopal Church of the United States, as a bishop of the Church of Nigeria. Akinola reportedly ignored requests not to do this from both the Presiding Bishop and the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, the timing of the requests and their intent, relative to Akinola's departure from Nigeria is a subject of contention.Akinola Response to KJS, May 2007 Akinola Response to RW, May 2007 The newly installed bishop indicated at a press conference that the intention was to replace the Episcopal Church of the USA (as an organ of the Anglican Communion) with a structure formed under auspices of the Church of Nigeria. Akinola was one of the principal founders of the Global Anglican Future Conference,Global Anglican Future Conference Official Website an international gathering of conservative and orthodox Anglican bishops and declared the Church of Nigeria in full communion with the newly created Anglican Church in North America, which was founded to create an alternative ecclesiastical structure to the Episcopal Church of the United States within the Anglican Communion. = Homosexuality laws in Nigeria = In September 2006, the Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria, headed by Akinola, issued a Message to the Nation, taking up ten political controversies in Nigeria, among them a bill regarding same-sex relationships: \\"The Church commends the law-makers for their prompt reaction to outlaw same-sex relationships in Nigeria and calls for the bill to be passed since the idea expressed in the bill is the moral position of Nigerians regarding human sexuality.\\" Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria: Message to the Nation, September 2006 The bill in question, as well as criminalising same- sex marriage, also proposed to criminalise \\"Registration of Gay Clubs, Societies and organizations\\" and \\"Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise\\", on penalty of up to 5 years of imprisonment. The proposed legislation was formally challenged by the United States State Department as a breach of Nigeria's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Some western supporters justify the legislation on the basis that it does not support the stoning to death of homosexuals under the Sharia code. = Reaction to Muslim cartoon riots = In February 2006, Muslims rioting over the Danish newspaper cartoon controversy spread to Nigeria. Rioters targeted Christians and their property, resulting in a reported 43 deaths, 30 burned churches and 250 destroyed shops and houses. Included among the victims was the family of one of Akinola's bishops, Ben Kwashi, the Bishop of Jos, who was out of the country at the time. Kwashi's home was broken into and his wife was tortured and sexually assaulted, resulting in her temporary blindness. The rioters also severely beat Kwashi's teenage son. In response to the rioting, Akinola issued a statement in his capacity as President of the Christian Association of Nigeria: \\"May we at this stage remind our Muslim brothers that they do not have the monopoly of violence in this nation.\\" Some criticized this statement as inciting Christian counter-riots against Muslim targets in Nigeria. (For example, Christian mobs in Onitsha retaliated against Muslims, killing 80 persons and burned a Muslim district with 100 homes, forcing hundreds of Muslims to flee the city.) American evangelical leader Rick Warren, however, wrote that Akinola's angry response \\"was no more characteristic than Nelson Mandela's apartheid-era statement that 'sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites'\\".

Under Irwin's influence, the magazine's covers promoted Canadian scenery and imagery. The magazine also sponsored an annual short story contest on Canadian themes and acquired a sports department. Irwin was also responsible for orienting the magazine towards both small and big \\"L\\" Liberalism. During the Second World War, Maclean's ran an overseas edition for Canadian troops serving abroad. By the time of its final run in 1946, the \\"bantam\\" edition had a circulation of 800,000. Maclean's war coverage featured war photography by Yousuf Karsh, later an internationally acclaimed portrait photographer, and articles by war correspondents John Clare and Lionel Shapiro. Irwin officially replaced Moore as editor in 1945, and reoriented the magazine by building it around news features written by a new stable of writers that included Pierre Berton, W. O. Mitchell, Scott Young, Ralph Allen, and Blair Fraser. Allen became editor upon Irwin's acceptance of a diplomatic posting in 1950. This era of the magazine was noted for its articles on the Canadian landscape and profiles of town and city life. The feature article, \\"Canada's North\\", by Pierre Berton, promoted a new national interest in the Arctic. Prominent writers during this period included Robert Fulford, Peter Gzowski, Peter C. Newman, Trent Frayne, June Callwood, McKenzie Porter, Robert Thomas Allen and Christina McCall. Expos√©s in the 1950s challenged the criminal justice system, explored LSD, and artificial insemination. Maclean's published an editorial the day after the 1957 federal election announcing the predictable re-election of the St. Laurent Liberal Party. Written before the election results were known, Allen failed to anticipate the upset election of the Progressive Conservative Party under John Diefenbaker. The magazine struggled to compete with television in the 1960s by increasing its international coverage and attempting to keep up with the sexual revolution through a succession of editors including Gzowski and Charles Templeton. Templeton quit after a short time at the helm due to his frustration with interference by the publishing company, Maclean-Hunter. In 1961, Maclean's began publishing a French-language edition, Le Magazine Maclean, which survived until 1976, when the edition was absorbed by L'actualit√©. Peter C. Newman became editor in 1971, and attempted to revive the magazine by publishing feature articles by writers such as Barbara Frum and Michael Enright, and poetry by Irving Layton. Walter Stewart, correspondent and eventually managing editor during this period, often clashed with Newman. In 1975 Newman brought in columnist Allan Fotheringham. Fotheringham made famous The Back Page, where he wrote for 27 years. Readers would go to read the Back Page first and then proceed to read the magazine from back to front. Under Newman, the magazine switched from being a monthly general interest publication to a bi-weekly news magazine in 1975, and to a weekly newsmagazine three years later. The magazine opened news bureaus across the country and international bureaus in London, England, and Washington, D.C.. In 1982, when Newman retired, his managing editor, Kevin Doyle, became editor-in-chief. Doyle, a former reporter for The Canadian Press in Ottawa and a New York-based writer for Newsweek, expanded coverage of news and opened a Moscow bureau. On his watch the magazine published the first of yearly annual polls by Allan Gregg on the Canadian condition and the controversial university ranking issue, which became an annual mini-franchise for the magazine. At its peak, the magazine had 2.3 million weekly readers. When Doyle left Maclean's in 1993, publisher Brian Segal appointed Robert Lewis as editor-in-chief. The managing editor under Doyle, Lewis had opened the magazine's Ottawa bureau in 1975 when it became a newsmagazine. Under Doyle, Lewis was responsible for the launch of the first university ranking issue. While he was editor, writer Ann Dowsett Johnston won several National Magazine Awards (NMA) for the annual university issue and the magazine received an honourable mention in the 1998 Michener Awards for investigative reporting on sexual harassment and rape in the Canadian military. The article by Jane O'Hara also won two medals at the National Magazine Awards in 1999, including the President's Medal, and \\"remains one of the most significant and studied feature stories in the history of Canadian magazines,\\" according to an official NMA history. =21st century= In 2001, Anthony Wilson-Smith became the 15th editor in the magazine's history. He left the post at the end of February 2005 and was replaced by Kenneth Whyte, who also served as the magazine's publisher. The magazine was owned by the Rogers Communications conglomerate since Rogers acquired Maclean-Hunter, the former publisher, in 1994 until 2019.Company Profile rogerspublishing.ca Whyte, who previously edited Saturday Night and the National Post, brought a right-wing focus to the magazine, bringing in conservative columnist Mark Steyn, hiring Andrew Coyne away from the Post, and rehiring Barbara Amiel. He also added a comedy feature by former Liberal Party strategist Scott Feschuk, and a column by Andrew Potter, who previously wrote for left-leaning periodicals. The magazine has 15 editions in Canada. Rogers Communications announced in September 2016 that due to falling print ad revenue the magazine is to change its printing schedule from weekly to monthly beginning in January 2017 although it will continue to offer weekly digital editions via Rogers' Texture digital bundle. On March 20, 2019, Rogers announced a deal to sell the magazine to St. Joseph Communications.  Controversy  =Canadian Islamic Congress complaint= In December 2007, the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) launched complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, British Columbia Human Rights Commission, and the Ontario Human Rights Commission against Maclean's accusing it of publishing 18 articles between January 2005 and July 2007 that they considered Islamophobic in nature including a column by Mark Steyn titled \\"The future belongs to Islam\\".Canadian Islamic Congress, \\"Human Rights Complaints Launched Against Maclean‚Äôs Magazine\\", Canada Newswire.

However, seeing the Maclean's article as an attack from outside the province, an attack from English Canada, and \\"with their [Quebec's] acute sensitivity to criticism coming from outside the province, many in the province's media and political classes have shifted their attention from the Premier to the mischievous Toronto-based magazine\\".

It is also known as Maclean's University Guide. It includes information from the Maclean's University Rankings, an issue of the magazine proper that is published annually in November, primarily for students in their last year of high school and entering their first year in Canadian universities. Both the Guide and the rankings issue feature articles discussing Canadian universities and ranking them by order of quality. The rankings focus on taking a measure of the \\"undergraduate experience\\", comparing universities in three peer groupings: Primarily Undergraduate, Comprehensive, and Medical Doctoral. Schools in the Primarily Undergraduate category are largely focused on undergraduate education, with relatively few graduate programs. Comprehensives have a significant amount of research activity and a wide range of graduate and undergraduate programs, including professional degrees. Medical Doctoral institutions have a broad range of PhD programs and research, as well as medical schools. In early 2006, Maclean's announced that in June 2006, it would be introducing a new annual issue called the University Student Issue. The issue would feature the results of a survey of recent university graduates from each Canadian university. However, many universities, such as the University of Calgary, McMaster University, and the University of Toronto, refused to take part in this exercise. The three institutions stated that they questioned the \\"magazine's ability to conduct a survey that would be rigorous and provide accurate and useful information to students and their parents\\".\\"Universities opt out of Maclean's graduate survey\\", McMaster Daily News. April 19, 2006.

Retrieved May 6, 2009 Results from these surveys, along with Maclean's own graduate survey, were published in the June 26, 2006, edition of Maclean's. For the November 2006 University Rankings issue, 22 Canadian universities refused to provide information directly to Maclean's. To rank those universities, the magazine relied on data it collected itself, as well as data drawn from third party sources such as Statistics Canada. Among the universities that refused to provide information directly to Maclean's in the fall of 2006 were: University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, Dalhousie University, McMaster University, University of New Brunswick, University of Manitoba, Universit√© du Qu√©bec network, Simon Fraser University, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge, Ryerson University, Universit√© de Montr√©al, University of Ottawa, York University, Concordia University, University of Western Ontario, Lakehead University, Queen's University, Carleton University, and University of Windsor. The withholding of data served as a means of voicing the universities' displeasure with the methodology used to determine the Maclean's ranking.11 universities bail out of Maclean's survey. CBC News.

The National Reputational Rankings, like the main university rankings, are broken into three subcategories: medical doctoral, comprehensive, and primarily undergraduate and are based on opinions of the quality of the universities. The quality opinions gathered were contributed by secondary school principals, guidance counsellors, organization and company heads, and recruiters. The results of the reputational rankings are included in the main university rankings, and account for 16% of a university's total ranking score.

O'Neill's career was played out against the background of the Tudor conquest of Ireland, and he is best known for leading the resistance during the Nine Years' War, the strongest threat to Tudor authority in Ireland since the revolt of Silken Thomas.  Family background and early career  Hugh O'Neill came from a line of the O'Neill dynasty ‚Äì derbfine ‚Äì that the English authorities recognized as the legitimate successors to the Chiefs of the O'Neills and to the title of Earl of Tyrone. He was the second son of Matthew O'Neill (Feardorcha √ì N√©ill), reputed illegitimate son of Conn, 1st Earl of Tyrone. Shane O'Neill (Se√°n an D√≠omais), a legitimate son of Conn O'Neill, employed the ambivalent status of Matthew's paternity to affirm his own claim to the title The O'Neill, although illegitimacy in itself made little or no difference in terms of the Irish legal system of derbfine, where five degrees of consanguinity through the male line with a blood ancestor who had held the O'Neill title were required of any claimant. Once Matthew was accepted by Conn as his son, he was as entitled to the O'Neill lordship as Shane, although, if proven, Shane's constant assertion that Matthew was actually an adoptee,; affiliated to the O'Neills, rather than the illegitimate issue of Conn would have rendered his claim to the earldom void and would have entirely disqualified him from succession also under derbfine. In the ensuing conflict for the succession, Matthew was killed by the √ì Donnaile followers of Shane and Conn, placing his sons Brian and Hugh in a precarious situation. The continuing support for their claims came from the English administration in Dublin Castle, which was anxious to use the support of the sons of Matthew to break the independent power of the O'Neill lords of Ulster. This was part of a general English policy to transform Irish Gaelic titles into feudal titles granted under the Crown that would bring them entirely within the English legal system through a policy known as surrender and regrant, in which the Irish Clan Chiefs forcibly surrendered their lands to the Crown and had them granted back into their keeping as property of the Crown, rather than the property of the sept, or Gaelic extended family. Hugh succeeded his brother, Brian, as baron of Dungannon, when the latter was assassinated by Shane's T√°naiste or deputy Turlough Luineach O'Neill in 1562. Hugh O'Neill was proclaimed Earl of Tyrone in 1585 but when he went through the ancient ritual of becoming 'The O'Neill', the Chief of T√≠r Eoghain, in 1595, he had thrown down the gauntlet to Tudor power.Se√°n √ì Faol√°in, The Great O'Neill: A Biography of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, 1550‚Äì1616, Dufour Editions, 1997. O'Neill became a ward of the state and was brought up in the Hovendan household, an Anglo-Irish family, at Balgriffin, outside Dublin, in the Pale. Growing up in an area of English control he had knowledge of English customs and politics, mainly through his attendance of the Irish Parliament and court in England. He was able to secure allies such as the Earls of Ormonde and Leicester.Hiram Morgan, Tyrone's Rebellion (Dublin, 1993), pp 92‚Äì3 But after the death of Shane he returned to Ulster in 1567 under the protection of Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of Ireland. In T√≠r Eoghain, Hugh's cousin, Turlough Luineach O'Neill, had succeeded Shane O'Neill as The O'Neill, or chieftain, but was not recognized by the English as the legitimate Earl of Tyrone. The Crown therefore supported Hugh O'Neill as the rightful claimant and as an ally in Gaelic controlled Ulster. During the First and Second Desmond Rebellions in Munster, he fought in 1580 with the English forces against Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, and assisted Sir John Perrot against the Highland Scots of Ulster in 1584. English commander Grey described him as the \\"first Irish lord to spill blood\\".  Rise to power  In the following year he was summoned to attend the Irish House of Lords in Dublin as Earl of Tyrone and, in 1587 after a visit to the Court in England, he was awarded a patent to the lands of his grandfather, the first earl, Conn O'Neill. However, with Turlough now having succeeded Shane as The O'Neill, he had yet to choose as T√°naiste. The position was contested by Hugh and Shane's sons, the MacShanes. Due to their father, the MacShanes were favoured within Tyrone, but outside the Kingdom they were disliked because of the cruelty of their father towards the various smaller Kingdoms under the overlordship of the O'Neills. Furthermore, the MacShanes had lost a valuable ally in the Fitzgeralds of Desmond, following their defeated in the Desmond Wars. Hugh, through marriage, was able to gain an important ally in the Red Hugh O'Donnell of T√≠r Chonaill, from whom he was able to secure Scottish mercenaries to fight the MacShanes. In turn, Hugh supported O'Donnell in a succession dispute within his own kingdom. Through his other contacts, Hugh had the support of lords and Earl's in Ormonde, Leicester and Argyll, and even had the support of Lord Deputy of Ireland Fitzwilliam, whom he bribed. With this overwhelming alliance, in 1592 Turlough was forced to name Hugh as his T√°naiste. Afterwards, Hugh ruthlessly murdered all the MacShanes, one of whom, Niall Garbhalach, he reputedly hanged over a Hawthorn tree with his bare hands. But it was during this war of succession that the English administration had began to become suspicious of O'Neill's ambitions, and in 1587 they kidnapped Hugh's ally Red Hugh O'Donnell, holding him in Dublin Castle, along with Art MacShane O'Neill. After several failed attempts to break him out of prison, in the winter of 1591 O'Neill was finally able to successfully aid the escape of O'Donnell and MacShane, possibly through the bribing of high-level officials in Dublin. The pair of fugitives fled the city to the Wicklow Mountains, a stronghold of the O'Byrnes, who were led by Fiach McHugh O'Byrne, one of O'Neill's allies. An O'Byrne search party found the two buried in snow and close to death near Glendalough. Red Hugh famously lost his two big toes to frostbite, but MacShane died. While it is believed MacShane died of exposure, there has been some speculation as to whether O'Neill had the O'Byrnes kill MacShane when they found him, to remove him as a political opponent of O'Neill. His constant disputes with Turlough were fomented by the English with a view to weakening the power of the O'Neills, but the two came to some agreement and Turlough abdicated in 1593. Hugh was subsequently inaugurated as The O'Neill at Tullyhogue in the style of the former Gaelic kings, and became the most powerful lord in Ulster. Turlough died in 1595.  Career  O'Neill's career was marked by unceasing power politics: at one time he appeared to submit to English authority, and at another intrigued against the Dublin government in conjunction with lesser Irish clan chiefs. In keeping with the practice common at the time, he bribed officials both in Ireland and at Elizabeth's court in London. Though entirely supported by the Dublin administration in his early years, he seems to have been unsure whether his position as Chief of the O'Neills was best secured by alliance with the English or by rebellion against the advance of their government into Ulster from 1585. O'Neill ruled as a sort of absolute monarch. Upon claiming the title of the O'Neill, Hugh decided that he needed to increase the revenue he was generating from the taxes on his subjects. Eventually, he was generating ¬£80,000 of revenue. For comparison, in the 1540s the Tudor monarchy in England was only making ¬£40,000 of revenue. Although that figure had certainly increased since then, in financial terms O'Neill was in a position to challenge the English administration. He also tied the peasantry to the land, effectively making them serfs, increasing production of materials and guaranteeing his supply of labour. The increased revenue allowed him to purchase muskets, pikes and ammunition from Britain. He also had several Spanish and English military advisors in his pay, the Spanish ones having been sent by Phillip II of Spain. O'Neill, like his predecessor Shane O'Neill, introduced conscription to all men within his country, regardless of their social class. Ultimately, the increased cashflow, coupled with th production of materials from the larger labour force, allowed O'Neill to arm and feed over 8,000 men‚Äì quite impressive for a Gaelic lord. The force was trained and equipped with the latest European weapons and tactics. In the early 1590s, English government in Ulster took the form of a Provincial Presidency, to be headed by the colonist, Henry Bagenal who lived at Newry. In 1591, O'Neill roused the ire of Bagenal by eloping with his sister, Mabel, but showed his loyalty to the crown with his military support for his brother-in- law in the defeat of Hugh Maguire at Belleek in 1593. After Mabel's death, O'Neill gradually fell into a barely concealed opposition to the crown and sought aid from Spain and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. In 1595, Sir John Norris was ordered to Ireland at the head of a considerable force for the purpose of subduing him, but O'Neill succeeded in taking the Blackwater Fort before Norris could prepare his forces. O'Neill was instantly proclaimed a traitor at Dundalk. The war that followed is known as the Nine Years' War. = Nine Years' War = O'Neill followed Shane's policy of arming his Clansmen, rather than relying as Turlough had done upon Scots mercenary soldiers, such as redshanks or Irish professionals employed under buannacht. This policy allowed him to field an impressive force, with calivers and gunpowder supplied from Spain and Scotland, and in 1595 he gave the crown authorities a shock by ambushing and routing a small English army at the Battle of Clontibret. He and other clan chiefs then offered the crown of Ireland to King Philip II of Spain who refused it. In spite of the traditional enmity between his people and the Chiefs of Clan O'Donnell, O'Neill allied himself with Hugh Roe O'Donnell, son of Shane's former ally and enemy Hugh O'Donnell, and the two chieftains opened communications with King Philip II of Spain. In some of their letters to the king ‚Äì intercepted by the lord deputy, Sir William Russell ‚Äì they were shown to have promoted themselves as champions of the Roman Catholic Church, claiming liberty of conscience as well as political liberty for the native inhabitants of Ireland. In April 1596, O'Neill received promises of help from Spain, and thereafter chose to temporize with the authorities, professing his loyalty to the crown whenever circumstances required. This policy was a success and, even though Sir John Norris sought to bring him to heel, O'Neill managed to defer English attempts on his territory for more than two years. In 1598, a cessation of hostilities was arranged and a formal pardon granted to O'Neill by Queen Elizabeth. Within two months he was again in the field, and on 14 August he destroyed an English army at the battle of the Yellow Ford on the Blackwater river, in which engagement the English Commander, Henry Bagenal, was killed.John McGurk, 'The Battle of the Yellow Ford, August 1598', D√∫iche N√©ill: Journal of the O'Neill Country Historical Society, no. 11 (1997), pp 34‚Äì55. It was the greatest of all setbacks to English arms in Ireland. If the Earl had been capable of driving home his advantage, he might have successfully upset English power in country, as discontent had broken out in every part ‚Äì and especially in the south, where James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald with O'Neill's support was asserting his claim to the Earldom of Desmond at the head of a formidable army of clans loyal to the Geraldines ‚Äì discontent broke into open rebellion. But Tyrone, who possessed but little generalship, procrastinated until the golden opportunity was lost. Eight months after the battle of the Yellow Ford, a new Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Essex, landed in Ireland with an expeditionary force sent there from England of 16,000 troops and 1500 horse.Lytton Strachey, Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History, Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1928, p.202 After months of ill-managed operations in the south of the country, and loss of three-quarters of his forces to disease, desertion, and execution of hundreds of troops for cowardiceStrachey, p.206-208 he had a parley with Tyrone at a ford on the Lagan on 7 September 1599, when a truce was arranged. Elizabeth was displeased by the favourable conditions allowed to O'Neill, as she pointed out, if she had intended to simply abandon Ireland she would not have needed to send Essex there, and by Essex's treatment of him as an equal. The Lord Lieutenant then traveled back to the Queen's court near London without permission ‚Äì a desperate move, which culminated, more than a year later, in a failed attempt at an uprising in London, and weeks after, his execution for high treason on 25 February 1601.Strachey, p.242-268 The queen was in a tricky situation, because political discourse was dominated by the issue of the succession to the throne, just as her most illustrious military commanders were being frustrated by O'Neill in the middle of the Anglo-Spanish War. Tyrone continued to concert measures with the Irish Clans in Munster, and issued a manifesto to the Catholics of Ireland, summoning them to join his standard as he protested that the interests of religion were his first care. After a campaign in Munster in January 1600, during which the Anglo-Irish Plantation of Munster was destroyed, he hastened north to Donegal, where he received supplies from Spain and a token of encouragement from Pope Clement VIII. At this point the controversial Jesuit, James Archer, was effectively operating as his representative at the Spanish court. In May 1600 the English achieved a strategic breakthrough, when Sir Henry Docwra, at the head of a considerable army, took up a position in O'Neill's rear at Derry; meanwhile, the new lord deputy, Sir Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy (a prot√©g√© of EssexStrachey, p.183), marched in support from Westmeath to Newry, compelling O'Neill to retire to Armagh. A large reward was offered for the rebel's capture, dead or alive. In October 1601, the long-awaited aid from Spain appeared in the form of an army under Don Juan de Aguila, which occupied the town of Kinsale in the extreme south of the country. Mountjoy rushed to contain the Spanish, while O'Neill and O'Donnell were compelled to hazard their armies in separate marches from the north, through territories defended by Sir George Carew, in the depths of a severe winter. They gained little support en route. At Bandon they joined together, and then blockaded the English army that was laying siege to the Spanish. The English were in a poor state, with many of their troops disabled with dysentery, and the extreme winter weather made life in camp very difficult. But owing to poor communications with the besieged Spanish and a crucial failure to withstand the shock of a daring English cavalry charge, O'Neill's army was quickly dispersed. The Irish clans retreated, and the Spanish commander surrendered. The defeat at the battle of Kinsale was a disaster for O'Neill and ended his chances of winning the war. O'Donnell went to Spain to seek further assistance, where he died soon afterwards (there was evidence to show poisoning by Anglo-Irish double-agent James 'Spanish' Blake was suspected, however he most likely died of a flu).With a shattered force, O'Neill made his way once more to the north, where he renewed his policy of ostensibly seeking pardon while warily defending his territory. English forces managed to destroy crops and livestock in Ulster in 1601‚Äì1602, especially in the lands of O'Neill's principal vassal, Donal O'Cahan. This led to O'Cahan's withdrawal from O'Neill, and fatally weakening his power. In June 1602 O'Neill destroyed his capital at Dungannon and retreated into the woods of Glenconkeyne.McCavitt p.44 Early in 1603, Elizabeth instructed Mountjoy to open negotiations with the rebellious chieftains, and O'Neill made his submission in the following April to Mountjoy, who skilfully concealed news of the death of the Queen until the negotiations had concluded. = Peace settlement = O'Neill went with Mountjoy to Dublin, where he heard of the accession of King James. He presented himself at the court of the king in June, accompanied by Rory O'Donnell, who had become chief of the O'Donnells after the departure of his brother Hugh Roe. The English courtiers were greatly incensed at the gracious reception accorded by James to these notable rebels. Although O'Neill was confirmed in his title and core estates, upon his return to Ireland he immediately fell into dispute with Chichester's Dublin administration. Under the 1603 peace agreement most of his land had been given to his former Brehon law tenants. in the case of the Bann Fishery, the government eventually established that his entitlement to the benefit of that property was nullified on account of the original Anglo-Norman conquest in 1172, a precedent of significant implications for the former Gaelic polity.See Peter Carew for similar legal moves in support of colonial policy In the meantime, it was the dispute over O'Neill's rights concerning certain of his former feudatories ‚Äì Donal O'Cahan being the most important ‚Äì that led to his flight from Ireland. They were now freeholders of the Kingdom of Ireland, with new legal rights, but O'Neill expected them to support him as in the past, which they declined to do. In O'Cahan's case the √ì Cath√°in clan had traditionally inaugurated the O'Neill kings in the past. Chichester consider O'Cahan's case to be pivotal, as if he caved in to O'Neill then other Ulster chiefs might also be persuaded to give up their freehold rights, and another war might follow. This dispute dragged on until 1607, when O'Neill was invited by King James to go to London to argue his case. Warned, however, that his arrest was imminent (and possibly persuaded by Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell ‚Äì whose relations with Spain had endangered his own safety) the decision was made to flee to Spain. = Flight = \\"The Flight of the Earls\\" occurred on 14 September 1607, when O'Neill and O'Donnell embarked at midnight at Rathmullan on Lough Swilly on a voyage bound for Spain. Accompanying them were their wives, families and retainers, numbering ninety-nine persons. Driven by contrary winds to the east, they took shelter in the Seine estuary and were told by the Spanish to pass the winter in the Spanish Netherlands and not to proceed to Spain itself. In April 1608, they proceeded to Rome, where they were welcomed and hospitably entertained by Pope Paul V. The journey to Rome was recorded in great detail by Tadhg √ì Cian√°in.√ì Cian√°in, T., \\"The Flight of the Earls\\", CELT (UCC) In November 1607 the flight was proclaimed as treasonous by James I.A Proclamation touching the Earles of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, 1607; CELT (UCC) A bill of attainder was passed against O'Neill by the Parliament of Ireland in 1613. The hopes of the earls for military support foundered as Philip III of Spain wanted to maintain the recent 1604 peace treaty with James I of England, the Spanish economy had gone bankrupt in 1596 and its European fleet had been destroyed some months earlier by the Dutch Republic at the Battle of Gibraltar. This suggests that the Flight was impulsive and unplanned. O'Neill died in Italy in the city of Rome on the 20th of July 1616 and was interred in the church of San Pietro in Montorio . Throughout his nine-year exile he was active in plotting a return to Ireland, toying variously both with schemes to oust English authority outright and with proposed offers of pardon from London. When the former Crown loyalist Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched O'Doherty's Rebellion by the Burning of Derry in 1608 it raised hopes of a return, but the rebellion was quickly defeated. Oghy O'Hanlon was Hugh's nephew and played a leading role in O'Doherty's Rebellion. As a principal rebel leader, Oghy O'Hanlon had been stripped of his inheritance by Sir Arthur Chichester, and he may have been taken into protective custody before his exile to Sweden. O'Hanlon was pressed into Swedish military service and threatened with execution if he resisted.Nicholas P. Canny, \\"Making Ireland British\\", 2001, Gr√°inne Henry, \\"Ulster Exiles in Europe, 1605‚Äì1641\\" Upon news of his death, the court poets of Ireland engaged in the Contention of the bards. Status in Ireland In 1598 O'Neill appointed James FitzThomas FitzGerald, the so-called Sug√°n Earl, as Earl of Desmond. Two years later in his camp at Inniscarra near Cork city he then recognized the celebrated Florence MacCarthy as the MacCarthy Mor or Prince of Desmond.Irish Pedigrees: MacCarthy Mor#123 The fiasco of the 1599 campaign by Essex in Ireland added to the power vacuum in most parts of Ireland. O'Neill had little influence on the Lords of the Pale in Leinster, and his army had to feed itself by plunder, making him unpopular. He made enemies of some lords by interfering in their traditional autonomy if they did not give him their entire support. These included Lord Inchiquin, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, The Magennis of west County Down and Tiob√≥id na Long Bourke. O'Neill issued a proclamation to the Pale Lords on 15 November 1599, many of whom were Roman Catholic, protesting that his campaign was not for personal power but only for the freedom of the Catholic religion. This was unconvincing to them, as before 1593 he had practised as an Anglican, and was not known for having any great interest in religion. At the international level, O'Neill and O'Donnell had offered themselves as vassals of King Philip II of Spain in late 1595, and suggested that Archduke Albert might be crowned Prince of Ireland, which was declined. In late 1599, in a strong position after Essex's failed campaign, O'Neill sent a list of 22 proposed terms for a peace agreement to Queen Elizabeth, including a request on the status of future English viceroys. This amounted to accepting English sovereignty over Ireland as a reality, while hoping for tolerance and a strong Irish-led administration. The proposal was ignored.\\"Hugh O'Neill's War aims\\", online version published by CELT (UCC) Family O'Neill was married four times: *Married a daughter, probably Katherine, of Brian Mac Phelim O'Neill of Clandeboye in 1574, the marriage was annulled on grounds of consanguinity, although they had had several children. She subsequently married Niall MacBrian Faghartach. *1574 married Siobh√°n (or Joanna; died 1591), daughter of Sir Hugh O'Donnell. In 1579 this marriage was repudiated, but shortly afterwards they were reconciled. They had two sons, and three daughters. **Hugh (1585‚Äì1609). He was known as the baron of Dungannon, died in Rome and was buried in San Pietro di Montorio. **Henry O'Neill (1586?‚Äì1617√ó21). He became a colonel of an Irish regiment in the Archduke's army. **Ursula, said to have been married to Sir Nicholas Bagenal. **Sorcha (or Sarah) who married to Arthur Magennis, 1st viscount Iveagh. **a daughter who married Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret. *Mabel (died 1595), the daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenal. *Catherine Magennis (died 15 March 1619‚ÄúHeroines or Victims?

She accompanied O'Neill in his flight, and is believed to have died at Louvain. She was the mother of several daughters, one of whom, Aellis (Elice, or Alice), married Sir Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim and another Hugh Roe O'Donnell. She also had three sons: **John O'Neill or Shane Niall (died 1641). He called himself 3rd Earl of Tyrone. He entered the Spanish army, was called \\"El conde de Tyrone\\", and was killed in Catalonia. **Con Brian (died 16 August 1617), who either was murdered or committed suicide in Brussels. It is probable O'Neill married a fifth time, for mention is made of a young countess of Tyrone during his residence in Rome. He had, in addition, numerous illegitimate children, of whom one, Con, who was left behind at the time of the flight, was educated at Eton College as a Protestant, and died apparently about 1622 in the Tower of London. Dramatic portrayals Hugh O'Neill was played by Alan Hale Sr. in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939). Hugh O'Neill was portrayed by Tom Adams in the Disney film: The Fighting Prince of Donegal (1966) with a character name change to Henry O'Neill. In the 1971 BBC drama Elizabeth R he was played by Patrick O'Connell. O'Neill is the central character in Brian Friel's play Making History (1989), which is concerned largely with his third marriage to Mabel Bagenal: Friel describes the marriage as a genuine if ill-fated love affair. Running Beast (2007), a musical theatre piece by playwright Donal O'Kelly with music by the composer Michael Holohan, commemorating The Flight of the Earls 1607‚Äì2007 The Rebel Crown, a one-man play on the turbulent life of Hugh O'Neill was produced at the Burnavon theatre in Cookstown Co Tyrone in May 2016 and The Markets Theatre in Armagh, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Hughs Death in Rome in 1616.

The principal difference with sample-based synthesis is that the seed waveforms are sampled sounds or instruments instead of fundamental waveforms such as sine and saw waves used in other types of synthesis. History Before digital recording became practical, instruments such as the Welte (1930s), phonogene (1950s) and the Mellotron (1960s) used analog optical disks or analog tape decks to play back sampled sounds. When sample-based synthesis was first developed, most affordable consumer synthesizers could not record arbitrary samples, but instead formed timbres by combining pre-recorded samples from ROM before routing the result through analog or digital filters. These synthesizers and their more complex descendants are often referred to as ROMplers. Sample-based instruments have been used since the Computer Music Melodian, the Fairlight CMI and the NED Synclavier. These instruments were way ahead of their time and were correspondingly expensive. The first recording using a sampling synthesizer was \\"Stevie Wonder's Journey Through \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\"\\" (1979) which used the Computer Music Melodian to create complex melodies and rhythms from sampled sounds from nature. The first tune Wonder recorded was \\"The First Garden\\" where he used a sampled bird chirp as the lead sound in the song. More affordable sample-based synthesizers available for the masses with the introduction of the Ensoniq Mirage (1984), Roland D-50 (1987) and the Korg M1 (1988), which surfaced in the late eighties. The M1 also introduced the music workstation concept. The concept has made it into sound cards for the multimedia PC, under the names such as wavetable card or wavetable daughterboard. (See Wavetable synthesis#Background) Advantages of sample- based synthesis The principal advantage of sample-based synthesis over other methods of digital synthesis such as physical modelling synthesis or additive synthesis is that processing power requirements are much lower. This is because most of the nuances of the sound models are contained in the prerecorded samples rather than calculated in realtime. In a contrast to analog synthesizers, the circuitry does not have to be duplicated to allow more voices to be played at once. Therefore the polyphony of sample-based machines is generally a lot higher. A downside is, however, that in order to include more detail, multiple samples might need to be played back at once (a trumpet might include a breath noise, a growl, and a looping soundwave used for continuous play). This reduces the polyphony again, as sample-based synthesizers rate their polyphony based on the number of multi-samples that can be played back simultaneously. Multisampling A sample-based synthesizer's ability to reproduce the nuances of natural instruments is determined primarily by its library of sampled sounds. In the earlier days of sample-based synthesis, computer memory was expensive and samples had to be as short and as few as possible. This was achieved by looping a part of the sample (often a single wave), and then using a volume envelope curve to make the sound fade away. An amplifying stage would translate key velocity into gain so that harder playing would translate into louder playback. In some cases key velocity also modulates the attack time of the instrument, leading to a faster attack for loud passages. As memory became cheaper, it became possible to use multisampling; instead of a single recording of an instrument being played back faster or slower to reproduce other pitches, the original instrument could be sampled at regular intervals to cover regions of several adjacent notes (splits) or for every note. This provides a more natural progression from the lower to the higher registers; lower notes don't sound dull, and higher notes don't sound unnaturally bright. It is also possible to sample the same note at several different levels of intensity, reflecting the fact that both volume and timbre change with playing style. For instance, when sampling a piano, 3 samples per key can be made; soft, medium and with force. Every possible volume in between can be made by amplifying and blending the samples. For sample-based models of instruments like the Rhodes piano, this multisampling is very important. The timbre of the Rhodes changes drastically from left to right on the keyboard, and it varies greatly depending on the force with which the key is struck. The lower registers bark, while the higher range has a more bell-like sound. The bark will be more distinct if the keys are struck with force. For the model to be sufficiently expressive, it is therefore necessary that multisamples be made across both pitch and force of playing. Sampling synthesizers A more flexible sample-based synthesis design allowing the user to record arbitrary waveforms to form a sound's basic timbre is called a sampler. Early samplers were very expensive, and typically had low sample rates and bit depth, resulting in grainy and aliased sound. Since the late-1980s, however, samplers have featured specifications at least as good as CDs. By the late 1990s, the huge increases in computer processor speed permitted the widespread development of software synthesizers and software samplers. The vast storage capacity of modern computers was ideally suited to sample-based synthesis, and many samplers have thus migrated to software implementations or been superseded by new software samplers.

Underwater videographer History In 1940 Hans Hass completed Pirsch unter Wasser (i.e. Stalking under Water) which was published by the Universum Film AG, lasted originally only 16 minutes and was shown in theatres before the main movie, but would eventually be extended by additional filming done in the Adriatic Sea close to Dubrovnik. It premiered in Berlin in 1942. Sesto Continente directed by Folco Quilici and released in 1954, was the first full-length, full-color underwater documentary. The Silent World is noted as one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to show the ocean depths in color. Its title derives from Jacques-Yves Cousteau's 1953 book The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure. =Submarine based= The first successful video-recording from a non-military submarine was made in May 1969. The purpose of the recording was to document the inspection and condition of an offshore oil storage unit located in of water off the Louisiana coast. During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, there was widespread interest in the United States in the topic of oceanography. Several major firms built small research submarines to explore the oceans. The major subs were Deep Star 4000, designed by Jacques Cousteau and built by Westinghouse Electric Company; Aluminaut, the first aluminum sub which was built by and operated by Reynolds Aluminum; Beaver, built by and operated by Rockwell International; Star III, owned and operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography; and DOWB (Deep Ocean Work Boat), built by and operated by General Motors. As part of their operations all of these subs attempted video- recordings. None were successful prior to 1969. The problem preventing a successful recording was in the output of the DC to AC power converted. This problem was resolved by using a different type of power converter. This new approach was used on the Shelf Diver, owned and operated by Perry Submarine to obtain the successful video-recording of the inspection of Tenneco‚Äôs Molly Brown 32,500 barrel oil storage unit. The success of this video-recording ignited an immediate interest in the oil field. Two months later the Shelf Diver was employed by Humble Oil and Refining Company to make a geological survey of the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. Limitations The primary difficulty in underwater camera usage is sealing the camera from water at high pressure, while maintaining the ability to operate it. The diving mask also inhibits the ability to view the camera image and to see the monitoring screen clearly through the camera housing. Previously the size of the video camera was also a limiting factor, necessitating large housings to enclose the separate camera and record deck. This results in a larger volume which creates extra buoyancy requiring a corresponding use of heavy weight to keep the housing underwater (about 64 lbs. per cubic foot of displacement or 1.03 kilogram per litre in sea water or 63 lbs per cubic foot of displacement (1 kilogram per litre) in fresh water). Early video cameras also needed large batteries because of the high power consumption of the system. Current Lithium-ion batteries have long run times with relatively light weight and low volume. Another problem is the lower level of light underwater. Early cameras had problems with low light levels, were grainy, and did not record much color underwater without auxiliary lighting. Large unwieldy lighting systems were problematic to early underwater videography. And last, underwater objects viewed from an airspace with a flat window, such as the eye inside a mask or the camera inside a housing, appear to be about 25% larger than they are. The photographer needs to move farther back to get the subject into the field of view. Unfortunately that puts more water between the lens and the subject resulting in less clarity and reduced color and light. This problem is solved by the use of dome ports. Dome ports allow for very close subject distances, decreasing the in-water light path and improving image brightness and color saturation. Modern improvements Action-camcorder with underwater housing. Today, the small size of fully automatic camcorders with large view screens and long-life rechargeable batteries has reduced the housing size and made underwater videography an easy, fun activity for the diver. Low-cost wide- angle lens add-ons are available for many cameras and some can even be fitted outside the camera housing for versatile use. This lets the photographer get closer and make the subject clearer and also with fewer focusing and depth of field problems. Today cameras are more sensitive to low light conditions and make automatic color balancing adjustments. Nevertheless, deeper water videography still needs auxiliary light sources to bring out colors filtered out of sunlight by the distance it has travelled through water. The longest wavelengths of light are lost first (reds and yellows) leaving only a greenish or blue cast in deep water. Even a hand light will help show off some of the magnificent colors of a coral reef or other marine life if used during recording. Modern underwater video lights are now relatively small, have run times of 45-60 minutes and output 600-8000 lumens. These LED lights are powered by Lithium-ion batteries and usually have a 5600K (daylight) color temperature. Video housings Many modern underwater housing are pressure resistant up to about 330 feet (100M). Typical construction is from moulded polycarbonate plastic, or aluminum for more professional systems. They usually have quick release snaps, an o-ring seal, and through housings fittings for several camera controls. A few are generic in nature from several manufacturers (such as Ikelite), and may be adaptable to several camera sizes. Most housings, however, are specific to the size and controls of a particular camera (such as Amphibico) type and may be marketed by the camera manufacturer or an after-market company. Housed video cameras now record in HD (1920X1080) with some cameras operating at 4K (3840 x 2160) resolutions. Recording media may be solid state Solid-state drives (SSD), SXS cards, professional flash media or SDHC/XC cards. Codecs include H.264, XAVC and others. Small \\"action\\" cameras such as the GoPro style cameras have taken diving by storm and create incredible images for relatively little cost, provided that there is sufficient light. These cameras often record on SDXC/HC or MicroSD cards. These cards should have data record rates of at least 45MB/s (Ultra) or faster. Occasionally housings might be advertised as \\"waterproof housings\\" rather than underwater housings. Waterproof housings are not intended for deep water use, but rather are splash protection housings for use around the pool, in rain, or to protect if dropped overboard. At the most they are for very shallow activities - usually not more than about 1 or 2 metres / 3 to 6 feet in depth. One manufacturer offers a plastic bag type housing with a watertight seal, and a glass port front. The flexible bag allows some modest camera control, but when taken deeper the air inside the bag compresses from the pressure and makes the controls nearly impossible to operate. These bags are usually limited to shallow snorkeling activities and damage to the bag may cause irreparable flooding damage. Still/video combinations Most current digital still cameras are also capable of capturing professional quality video images. This is usually a variation of the MPEG video standard of digital imaging created as a streaming series of digital images, with some advanced compression techniques. Codecs include QuickTime Video, H.264, WMV or AVI files. A dedicated video camera, on the other hand may also have a \\"still frame\\" or snapshot capability. This is a better choice if the first intent is to have high quality moving pictures and an occasional still picture. Camera capacity, based on videotapes, or even harddrive recording is usually at least 2 hours, and necessitates very little opening of the housing during the dive day. Check the Pixel quality (16 megapixels or above preferred) on the still camera capability if this is of interest. Hi-definition video cameras (1080i), like high definition television screens, will provide the best quality and image resolution. The trend today is toward replaceable memory cards for recording, or internal hard-drives built into the camera. This provides maximum versatility, high recording time options, and few mechanical breakdown possibilities, not to mention minimizing problems with condensation affecting the recording (tape) media of previous generations. The subsequent files may be easily transferred to a computer and edited with low-cost software solutions (and a reasonably high performance computer and video card). The subsequent results may be transferred to a CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc or thumbdrive for easy distribution or archiving. Many videographers maintain their own YouTube or Vimeo channel for sharing and showcasing their work. Risk The usual hazards of underwater diving are generally not directly affected using video equipment, but the risk associated with these hazards may be increased by task loading. This generally reduces the available attention and situational awareness of the operator, and the additional encumbrance of large video equipment reduces the diver's ability to react swiftly and precisely to rectify problems before they become serious. These issues are generally mitigated by practice, and where appropriate an assistant may be useful. Diving with a skilled and attentive buddy can also reduce the risk of problems getting out of control, but this buddy must be dedicated to monitoring the videographer throughout the dive to be of value.

The group toured extensively and released four studio albums, one compilation, numerous singles and EPs, and a live album which was released after the band broke up in 1998. In 2011 the band began a reunion tour that coincided with the reissue of four of its albums by Merge Records. History =Early history (1991‚Äì1995)= Singer/guitarist Eric Bachmann, guitarist Eric Johnson, bassist Matt Gentling, and drummer Mark Price, all originally from Asheville, North Carolina, formed Archers of Loaf in the early 1990s. Eric Bachmann was a saxophone major at Appalachian State University before dropping out because he \\"didn't want to be a high school band director.\\" Their initial release in 1992 was a 45\\" single, \\"Wrong\\" b/w \\"South Carolina\\" given away free with issue 1 of Stay Free! magazine. The band signed with Alias records, and released their second single \\"Web in Front\\" in February 1993; it received moderate college radio airplay. The song was featured in a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-Head, and was included on the soundtrack of the movie Mallrats in 1995. Archers of Loaf released their debut full-length album, Icky Mettle, in September 1993. It was critically well-received, with critic Robert Christgau awarding his second-highest rating of \\"A\\", and peaked at #18 on the CMJ New Music Monthly Top 150 Album charts, charting for 21 weeks. In the 2008 book The Pitchfork 500 named \\"Web in Front\\" one of the top 500 songs of recent decades. In 1994, the Archers released the EP Vs the Greatest of All Time. However, the song \\"The Greatest of All Time\\" does not appear on this release but rather the second full-length album, Vee Vee, released in 1995. Vee Vee followed a similar template as their previous recordings and featured the track \\"Harnessed in Slums\\", which became popular on college radio. The album also garnered significant attention outside the independent music scene, culminating in the band being courted by Maverick Records, a division of Warner Music Group, which the band rejected. Bachmann later stated that he and the band did not really consider the offer. The band was still under contract with Alias, and changing labels would put them into considerable debt to Maverick. According to Bachmann, \\"We already signed a deal [with Alias] and it costs lots of money to get out of these things. If we would have had Maverick buy out our contract, we'd be however many thousands of dollars in debt to them. It's really complex that way and it really didn't make sense to do that.\\" The band had another reason for rejecting the Maverick offer: They did not want to be associated with the other high-profile bands on Maverick. \\"The other bands [on Maverick] were that bad,\\" said Price at the time. \\"There are other bands on major labels that are associated with a lot of shit but it's big enough that there are a least a few bands that you like. For us on Maverick, it'd be us and Candlebox and Alanis Morissette...\\" In 1995 the band had its highest-profile tour opening for Weezer. The band's sometimes brash sound did not go over all that well with the Weezer crowd, and Gentling later said of the tour, \\"It wasn't as much that we didn't like the Weezer guys, but the opening bands get treated like crap by the people who work (at the venues). And as far as our music is concerned, I don't really know if we're all that compatible, at least live.\\" In 1996 the band released The Speed of Cattle, a collection of B-sides, singles, and John Peel session tracks. =Later years and breakup (1996‚Äì1998)= Their third studio album, 1996's All the Nation's Airports, was considered far more accessible than their previous releases, and was the first to be distributed by a major label, Elektra Records (the band was still signed to Alias Records, though). The album was recorded in Seattle and took three weeks to complete, which was the most time the band had been in the studio to complete an album up to that point. Gentling said of the experience, \\"We knew we wanted to take a long time on this album. We specifically wanted not to do tracks over and over and over again, but more to work on tone and get all of our instruments down right. We took over a day (just) to get the drums sounding right.\\" The band toured extensively in support of the record, to limited mass commercial success. Of the tour, Bachmann said, \\"We got back and we were not real happy with the way that [the tour] went. Usually when you finish a tour you have a general idea of a song or two you can start working on, but we got back and were like 'geez, what are we going to do?'\\" The band almost broke up at this point, due to a general lack of enthusiasm for the continuation of the project. However, after some soul searching, they decided to continue on for the time being. \\"We thought we'd had too good a time with it, so let's make another record, do another tour, and if there's not another spark, we'll split up after that,\\" said Bachmann of the episode. Their final LP, White Trash Heroes, was released in 1998. The album's style deviated drastically from their first three albums, and received mixed reviews from critics. The album's creative break from the band's previous work may have stemmed from the different writing process used for White Trash Heroes. According to Bachmann, \\"Things were laid down one at a time, though we did play a lot of it live, too, but pieced together more perfectly so we could hear when one sound was beginning to get in the way of something else.\\" The band went to great lengths in the studio in an attempt to keep the writing from turning stale. For example, on the song \\"Banging on a Dead Drum,\\" the band members all switched instruments to try to liven up the feel of the song. Johnson plays drums, Gentling plays slide guitar, Price plays bass, and Bachmann still plays guitar, as he was the one who knew the song. This approach made playing songs from the album on the last tour more difficult. \\"Certain songs we don't even play yet,\\" Bachmann stated in an interview during the White Trash Heroes tour. \\"We haven't even learned them that well due to the way the record was pieced together. They're not impossible to play, we just haven't pulled them out yet...as time goes on we learn more of the new ones, and they've been coming across fine.\\" During the tour supporting the album, Eric Johnson missed several dates due to his day job's work schedule. Brian Causey, guitarist for Man or Astro-man? and friend of the band, filled in for the missing Johnson. In late 1998, after Price was diagnosed with, and subsequently had surgery for, carpal tunnel syndrome, the band decided to call it quits for good. =Post-breakup projects= Bachmann moved on to multiple solo projects and the band Crooked Fingers. Gentling went on to provide extra instrumentation on tour with another North Carolina-bred band, Superchunk as well as a brief stint as live bassist for Band of Horses, the Poles, and Analog Moon. He has also continued to work with Bachmann as a contributor in Crooked Fingers. Johnson self-released one EP and one full- length under the moniker \\"Spookie\\" (originally Spookie J) and attended law school in North Carolina. He continues to play and record. In 2000, Alias released Seconds Before the Accident. This project was the band's first official live album and was recorded during their final show at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro. It was the last album released by the band. =Reunion (2011‚Äìpresent)= On January 15, 2011, Archers of Loaf reunited to play an unannounced set at The Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina. They opened for local act The Love Language. On May 29, 2011 they performed at the Sasquatch! Music Festival outside of Seattle, Washington which was recorded for broadcast and archive by NPR Music and KEXP-FM. The band were chosen by Les Savy Fav to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. On June 25, 2011 the band performed their song \\"Wrong\\" on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The band continued to tour throughout 2011 and 2012 while their back catalog was reissued by Merge Records. Bachmann has stated in interviews that his thought processes around the band have changed over time and that his relationships with the older material are also different: \\"Essentially, before, when I was a 20-year-old kid playing that stuff, I got some sense of satisfaction or power. I felt confident playing in front of people. Now I don't feel that satisfaction or that power,\\" he said. \\"The reward I get now is I'm going out and people are enjoying hearing it. My relationship had to change with the songs, and in that light I like all of them.\\" Asked about the band's future plans, Bachmann did not rule out a new album, but noted that it was not something that was on the immediate horizon following the reunion tour. \\"The worst thing [Archers of Loaf] could do is force something out and have it be a bad version of something we already did. It's going to have to be a forward step. I don't want to recreate the 25-year-old kid writing the songs that I would do now with those three other guys, so we'd have to think that through. They're very good to work with, in that way. It's not out of the question, because everyone thinks the same way. No one wants to do 'Icky Mettle 2.'\\" A live concert documentary What Did You Expect?, capturing the band's August, 2011 performances at The Cat's Cradle was released in 2012. The film was directed by Gorman Bechard. In 2015, the band released the double album Curse of the Loaf, which is the Brian Paulson produced concert audio from the documentary. The deluxe package also featured the original poster from the two nights at Cat's Cradle, as well as a copy of the film. In a 2018 interview with Eric Bachmann, he said all of the members of Archers of Loaf are on board with the idea of reforming and making a new record, saying \\"Oh yeah, everybody wants to do it ‚Äî I just have to write the songs.\\" In November 2019, the band posted a video on their YouTube channel entitled \\"The Return Of The Loaf,\\" teasing toward new music. On February 20, 2020, the Archers of Loaf digitally released \\"Raleigh Days\\", their first new music since 1998.

The name E-M-F was gleaned from the initials of the three company founders: Barney Everitt (a custom auto-body builder from Detroit), William Metzger (formerly of Cadillac), and Walter Flanders (who had served as Henry Ford's production manager). At Google Books (description only)  Origins  8x10 black and white, sepia-toned photograph of the E.M.F. Company factory exterior with supply yard = Everitt = Byron F. \\"Barney\\" Everitt was born in 1872 at Ridgetown, Ontario, and learned wagon-building in Chatham, Ontario. In the early 1890s he worked for carriage-maker Hugh Johnson in Detroit.Rubenstein, James M. The Changing US Auto Industry: A geographical analysis Routledge 1992. At Google Books In 1899 he started his own coachwork company, with orders from Ransom Olds, and then Henry Ford. In about 1904 his own first assembled car was the Wayne. The car model bearing his name was the Everitt, 1909-1912. = Metzger = William E. Metzger was born 1868 in Peru, Illinois. He was one of the first car salesmen, a buyer and reseller and, in the late 1890s, established possibly the first United States automobile dealership, in Detroit. He was a key figure in the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, and also promoted early races at Grosse Pointe. In 1902 he became affiliated with the Northern Motor Car Company and the same year helped organize Cadillac before taking orders at the New York Automobile Show in January 1903. = Flanders = Walter E. Flanders was born March 4, 1871 in Waterbury, Vermont.The family's genealogy lists him as [6679] the eldest of three known children of Dr George T. Flanders and Mary M. Goodwin; in . He was a machinist who started with servicing sewing machines during an apprenticeship at Singer Corporation, followed by an association with Thomas S. Walburn in general machining in Cleveland, Ohio, in the late 1890s. An order came from Henry Ford in Detroit to the company for a thousand crankshafts, and Ford was impressed by the response. Then in the early 1900s Flanders again worked with Walburn, this time for Ford at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant at the corner of Piquette and Beaubien Streets in Detroit. Flanders became manager of manufacturing at the plant, where he also worked with the two future vice-presidents in charge of manufacturing, Peter E. Martin, and Charles E. Sorensen. Flanders was replaced by those two when he resigned abruptly on 21 April 1908. Flanders' skill was in setting up and effecting timesaving procedures and methods at the plant, where engineers had developed the Model T in late 1907, which then began production in 1908, and led eventually to invention of the new moving assembly line to meet skyrocketing demand for the Model T in 1910.  Overview  In 1909, E-M-F bought the Detroit plant of the De Luxe company and began production of E-M-F cars. E-M-F produced several models of its own design and contracted to sell them through Studebaker wagon dealerships. At one point, E-M-F vehicles outsold all but Ford in the American market. Late in 1909, E-M-F established a Walkerville, Ontario, branch plant to produce the E-M-F 30 and Flanders 20. E-M-F had a third plant in Port Huron, which was sold to the Havers Motor Car Company in 1912. Shortly afterward, E-M-F was bought out by Studebaker, which formed Studebaker Canada, and rebadged E-M-F's products: the E-M-F as the Studebaker 30 and the Flanders as the Studebaker 20. Sales of these rebadged models continued through the end of 1912.  Takeover  Studebaker's president Fred Fish (son-in-law of John M. Studebaker), being unhappy with E-M-F's poor quality and lack of management, gained control of the assets and plant facilities (at Detroit and Walkerville, Ontario) in 1910.Studebaker Corporation Financial Post Oct 1929 To remedy the damage done by E-M-F, Studebaker paid mechanics to visit each unsatisfied owner and replace the defective parts in their vehicles at a cost of US$1 million to the company. The E-M-F name continued into 1912 with the Studebaker name becoming more and more prevalent on the cars. In 1913, the E-M-F name was replaced by Studebaker. Problems aside, E-M-F vehicles had sold well in the growing marketplace. In 1909 E-M-F placed fourth (producing 7,960 vehicles) in total US automobile production, behind that of Ford Motor Company, Buick, and Maxwell, with Cadillac fifth. In 1910 the firm built 15,020 vehicles and again held on to fourth place behind Ford, Buick, and Overland. In 1911, the firm placed second in overall assemblies with 26,827 automobiles produced for the year. In his history of E-M-F, Anthony Yanik stated Studebaker built its strong automotive base \\"on the shoulders of E-M-F\\", having \\"purchased the entire company for an outrageous price in 1910\\". However, the E-M-F production figures had been underpinned by Studebaker's vast resources, and sales were largely dependent on Studebaker's reputation and marketing network. Flanders also ran the short-lived Flanders Automobile Company, which produced cars wholly based on previous E-M-F designs. The Flanders company was absorbed into Maxwell Motor Company (Incorporated) which was reorganized out of the assets of the United States Motor Company in 1913. On June 20, 2005, the E-M-F Detroit plant on Piquette Avenue and John R. Street caught fire and within a few hours it was gone. The five-alarm fire nearly spread to the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant where Henry Ford built the first Model T.

Name The name has also been applied to any thick or large coin, such as the Groschen (grosso), a silver coin issued by Tyrol in 1271 and Venice in the 13th century, which was the first of this general size to circulate in the Holy Roman Empire and other parts of Europe. The immediate ancestor to the groat was the French gros tournois or groat of Tours, which was known as the groot (Dutch for \\"great\\" or \\"large\\") in the Netherlands. The name also refers to a range of other European coins such as those of the Italian peninsula known as a grosso including the grosso of Venice and the Krak√≥w grosz. Marco Polo referred to the groat in recounts of his travels to East Asia when describing the currencies of the Yuan Empire.Yule, Henry; Cordier, Henri. The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition. Third edition (1903), revised and updated by Henri Cordier. Plain Label Books. p. 1226-27.

Third edition (1903), revised and updated by Henri Cordier. Plain Label Books. p. 1229-30. (Note) () History It was after the French silver coin had circulated in England that an English groat was first minted under King Edward I. Scots groats were not issued until the reign of David II. Scots groats were originally also worth fourpence, but later issues were valued at eightpence and a shilling.Mackay: Coin...Stewart: Scottish... Irish groats were minted first in 1425 and the last ones were minted under the reign of Elizabeth I of England. There were also two more issues, both emergency coinage.Grueber: Handbook... While strictly speaking, the English groat should have contained four pennyweights or 96 grains (6.2 grams) of sterling silver, the first ones issued weighed 89 grains (5.8 g) and later issues became progressively lighter. The weight was reduced to 72 grains (three pennyweights or 4.7 g) under Edward III, 60 grains (3.9 g) under Henry IV, and 48 grains (3.1 g) under Edward IV. From 1544 to 1560 (the weight being reduced to 32 grains (2.1 g) in 1559) the silver fineness was less than sterling, and after the 1561 issue they were not generally issued for circulation again for about a hundred years. From the reigns of Charles II to George III, groats (by now often known as fourpences) were issued on an irregular basis for general circulation, the only years of mintage after 1786 being in 1792, 1795, and 1800. After this the only circulating issues were from 1836 to 1855, with proofs known from 1857 and 1862, and a colonial issue of 1888. These last coins had the weight further reduced to about 27 grains (1.9 grams) and were the same diameter as the silver threepenny pieces of the day although thicker. They also had Britannia on the reverse, while all other silver fourpenny pieces since the reign of William and Mary have had a crowned numeral \\"4\\" as the reverse, including the silver fourpenny Maundy money coins of the present. Some groats continued to circulate in Scotland until the 20th century. At times in the past, silver twopenny coins have been called \\"half-groats\\". The groat ceased to be minted in the United Kingdom in 1856, but in 1888 a special request was made for a colonial variety to be minted for use in British Guiana and the British West Indies. The groat remained in circulation in British Guiana right up until that territory adopted the decimal system in 1955. Groats are still issued in sets of Maundy Coinage. =Royal Navy chaplains= In the 1600s and 1700s, chaplains were employed in English Navy ships of war by the captain, and paid out of a groat per month deducted from the wages of the seamen. The Navy's wages did not rise between 1653 and 1797 (see Spithead and Nore mutinies), during which time the ordinary seaman was paid 19 shillings, as was the chaplain.Christopher Lloyd (1970). \\"The Early Stuart Mariner\\". The British seaman 1200‚Äì1860: a social survey. Associated University Presses. pp. 69, 249. Accessed 12 July 2011. Cultural references The word \\"groat\\" has entered into a number of English and Scottish expressions, many of them now archaic. In the north of England, there is the saying \\"Blood without groats is nothing\\" meaning \\"family without fortune is worthless.\\" The allusion is to black pudding, which consists chiefly of blood and oats formed into a sausage and cut into slices. \\"Not worth a groat\\" is an old saying meaning \\"not worth a penny\\", i.e. worthless. Benjamin Franklin, in his book, Necessary Hints gives the following thrifty advice: Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin features the following riddle: The answer is \\"a cherry.\\" In The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, a character recounts the paying of groats to people who held her underwater to determine if she was a witch: According to Hawkins' History of the Silver Coins of England,Edward Hawkins, Silver Coins of England, London, MDCCCXLI. p.257 groats were also known as \\"Joeys\\", This refers to the Victorian fourpenny piece. The mention of cab fares is related to the fact that the standard minimum was fourpence, so many passengers paid with a sixpenny piece, allowing the cabbie to keep the twopence change as a tip. The slang name \\"Joey\\" was transferred to the silver threepenny pieces in use in the first third of the twentieth century. In A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett, Sara Crewe picks up a fourpenny piece from the street and uses it to buy buns. The original story was set in 1888. John o' Groats, a place name in the north of Scotland, is not derived from \\"groat\\" but is a corruption of \\"Jan de Groot\\", the name of a Dutchman who migrated there in the reign of James IV.

He is considered to be a founder of the New Criticism school of literary criticism. As a faculty member at Kenyon College, he was the first editor of the widely regarded Kenyon Review. Highly respected as a teacher and mentor to a generation of accomplished students, he also was a prize-winning poet and essayist. Biography =Early life= John Crowe Ransom was born on April 30, 1888, in Pulaski, Tennessee. His father, John James Ransom (1853‚Äì1934) was a Methodist minister. His mother was Sara Ella (Crowe) Ransom (1859‚Äì1947). He had two sisters, Annie Phillips and Ella Irene, and one brother, Richard. He grew up in Spring Hill, Franklin, Springfield, and Nashville, Tennessee. He was home schooled until age ten. From 1899 to 1903, he attended the Bowen School, a public school whose headmaster was Vanderbilt alumnus Angus Gordon Bowen. He entered Vanderbilt University in Nashville at the age of fifteen, graduating first in his class in 1909. His philosophy professor was Collins Denny, later a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Ransom interrupted his studies for two years to teach sixth and seventh grades at the Taylorsville High School in Taylorsville, Mississippi, followed by teaching Latin and Greek at the Haynes-McLean School in Lewisburg, Tennessee. After teaching one more year in Lewisburg, he was selected as a Rhodes Scholar. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, 1910‚Äì13, where he read Greats. John Crowe Ransom with Robie Macauley (left) at the Kenyon Review in 1959. Photo by Thomas Greenslade. =Career= He taught Latin for one year at the Hotchkiss School alongside Samuel Claggett Chew (1888‚Äì1960). He was then appointed to the English department at Vanderbilt University in 1914. During the First World War, he served as an artillery officer in France. After the war, he returned to Vanderbilt. He was a founding member of the Fugitives, a Southern literary group of sixteen writers that functioned primarily as a kind of poetry workshop and included Donald Davidson, Allen Tate, and Robert Penn Warren. Under their influence, Ransom, whose first interest had been philosophy (specifically John Dewey and American pragmatism) began writing poetry. His first volume of poems, Poems about God (1919), was praised by Robert Frost and Robert Graves. The Fugitive Group had a special interest in Modernist poetry and, under Ransom's editorship, started a short-lived but highly influential magazine, called The Fugitive, which published American Modernist poets, mainly from the South (though they also published Northerners like Hart Crane). Out of all the Fugitive poets, Norton poetry editors Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair opined that, \\"[Ransom's poems were] among the most remarkable,\\" characterizing his poetry as \\"quirky\\" and \\"at times eccentric.\\"Ellmann, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. The Norton Anthology of Poetry. Second Edition. New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1973. 467. In 1930, alongside eleven other Southern Agrarians, he published the conservative, Agrarian manifesto I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition, which assailed the tide of industrialism that appeared to be sweeping away traditional Southern culture.Conkin, Paul K. The Southern Agrarians. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988. The Agrarians believed that the Southern tradition, rooted in the pre-Civil War agricultural model, was the answer to the South's economic and cultural problems. His contribution to I'll Take My Stand is his essay Reconstructed but Unregenerate which starts the book and lays out the Southern Agrarians' basic argument. In various essays influenced by his Agrarian beliefs, Ransom defended the manifesto's assertion that modern industrial capitalism was a dehumanizing force that the South should reject in favor of an agrarian economic model. However, by the late 1930s he began to distance himself from the movement, and in 1945, he publicly criticized it.Conkin, Paul K. The Southern Agrarians. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988. He remained an active essayist until his death even though, by the 1970s, the popularity and influence of the New Critics had seriously diminished. In 1937, he accepted a position at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He was the founding editor of the Kenyon Review, and continued as editor until his retirement in 1959.Thomas Daniel Young, Gentleman in a Dustcoat: A Biography of John Crowe Ransom, Louisiana State University Press, Southern Literary Studies Series, January 1977, pp. 428‚Äì30. . In 1966, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He has few peers among twentieth-century American university teachers of humanities; his distinguished students included Donald Davidson, Randall Jarrell, George Lanning, Robert Lowell, Andrew Lytle, Allen Tate, Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley, Robert Penn Warren, E.L. Doctorow, Cleanth Brooks, Richard M. Weaver, James Wright, and Constantinos Patrides (himself a Rhodes Scholar, who dedicated his monograph on John Milton's Lycidas to Ransom's memory). His literary reputation is based chiefly on two collections of poetry, Chills and Fever (1924) and Two Gentlemen in Bonds (1927).Thomas Daniel Young, John Crowe Ransom: an annotated bibliography, (Modern Critics and Critical Schools). Volume 3 of Garland, bibliographies of modern critics and critical schools. Volume 354 of Garland reference library of the humanities. Garland Publishing Co., 1982. Believing he had no new themes upon which to write, his subsequent poetic activity consisted almost entirely of revising (\\"tinkering\\", he called it) his earlier poems. Hence Ransom's reputation as a poet is based on the fewer than 160 poems he wrote and published between 1916 and 1927. In 1963, the poet/critic and former Ransom student Randall Jarrell published an essay in which he highly praised Ransom's poetry: > In John Crowe Ransom's best poems every part is subordinated to the whole, > and the whole is accomplished with astonishing exactness and thoroughness. > Their economy, precision, and restraint gives the poems, sometimes, an > original yet impersonal perfection. . .And sometimes their phrasing is > magical--light as air, soft as dew, the real old-fashioned enchantment. The > poems satisfy our nostalgia for the past, yet themselves have none. They are > reports . .of our world's old war between power and love, between those who > efficiently and practically know and those who are \\"content to feel/ What > others understand.\\" And these reports of battles are, somehow, bewitching. . > .Ransom's poems profess their limitations so candidly, almost as a principle > of style, that it is hardly necessary to say they are not poems of the > largest scope or the greatest intensity. But they are some of the most > original poems ever written, just as Ransom is one of the best, most > original, and most sympathetic poets alive; it is easy to see that his > poetry will always be cared for, since he has written poems that are > perfectly realized and occasionally almost perfect.\\"Jarrell, Randall. \\"Fifty > Years of American Poetry.\\" No Other Book: Selected Essays. New York: > HarperCollins, 1999. Despite the brevity of his poetic career and output, Ransom won the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 1951. His 1963 Selected Poems received the National Book Award the following year. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1964\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-03. (With essay by John Murillo from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) He primarily wrote short poems examining the ironic and unsentimental nature of life (with domestic life in the American South being a major theme). An example of his Southern style is his poem \\"Janet Waking\\", which \\"mixes modernist with old-fashioned country rhetoric.\\" Tillinghast 1997 He was noted as a strict formalist, using both regular rhyme and meter in almost all of his poems. He also occasionally employed archaic diction. Ellman and O'Clair note that \\"[Ransom] defends formalism because he sees in it a check on bluntness, on brutality. Without formalism, he insists, poets simply rape or murder their subjects.\\" Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. The Norton Anthology of Poetry. Second Edition. New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1973. 467. He was a leading figure of the school of literary criticism known as the New Criticism, which gained its name from his 1941 volume of essays The New Criticism. The New Critical theory, which dominated American literary thought throughout the middle 20th century, emphasized close reading, and criticism based on the texts themselves rather than on non-textual bias or non-textual history. In his seminal 1937 essay, \\"Criticism, Inc.\\" Ransom laid out his ideal form of literary criticism stating that, \\"criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic.\\" To this end, he argued that personal responses to literature, historical scholarship, linguistic scholarship, and what he termed \\"moral studies\\" should not influence literary criticism. He also argued that literary critics should regard a poem as an aesthetic object.Ransom, John Crowe. Criticism, Inc.\\" The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. Ed Vincent Leitch, et al. New York, W. W. Norton Co., 2001. 11108-1118. Many of the ideas he explained in this essay would become very important in the development of The New Criticism. \\"Criticism, Inc.\\" and a number of Ransom's other theoretical essays set forth some of the guiding principles that the New Critics would build upon. Still, his former students, specifically Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Robert Penn Warren, had a greater hand in developing many of the key concepts (like \\"close reading\\") that later came to define the New Criticism. =Personal life= In 1920, he married Robb Reavill, a well- educated young woman who shared his interest in sports and games. Together they raised three children: a daughter, Helen, and two sons, David and John. =Death= He died on July 3, 1974, in Gambier at the age of eighty-six.

It was proposed in April 1918, after Estonia and Latvia had formally declared independence. The idea comprised the lands in Estonia and Latvia and included the creation of a Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and a Duchy of Estonia and Livonia that would be in personal union with the Crown of Prussia under the German Empire's occupied territory ' before the end of World War I covering the territories of the Medieval Livonia in what are now Latvia and Estonia.  Historical background  During World War I the German Imperial Army had occupied the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire by the autumn of 1915. The front stabilised along the line Riga‚ÄìDaugavpils‚ÄìBaranovichi. Following the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Russian Provisional Government declared the establishment of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia on , amalgamating the former Russian Governorate of Estonia and the northern portion of the Governorate of Livonia. After the October Revolution later in the same year, the elected Estonian Provincial Assembly declared itself the sovereign power in Estonia on 28 November 1917. On 24 February 1918, a day before the arrival of German troops, the Estonian Salvation Committee of the Provincial Assembly issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence. The Western Allies recognized the Republic of Estonia de facto in May 1918. The term 'Grand Duchy of Livonia' refers to the Livonia region, which made up most of the young United Baltic Duchy. The Latvian Provisional National Council was constituted on the basis of the law of self-government which the Russian Provisional Government granted to Latvia on 5 July 1917. The Latvian Provisional National Council first met on 16 November 1917 in Valka. On 30 November 1917, the Council declared an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formal independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918. After the Russian Revolution, German troops had started advancing from Courland, and by the end of February 1918 the German military administered the territories of Estonia that had declared independence and the Russian Governorate of Livonia. With the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk on 3 March 1918, Bolshevist Russia accepted the loss of the Courland Governorate, and by agreements concluded in Berlin on 27 August 1918, the loss of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia and the Governorate of Livonia.  Attempt to create the United Baltic Duchy  Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, 1910 As a parallel political movement under the German military administration, Baltic Germans began forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918. On 8 March 1918, the local Baltic German-dominated ' declared the restoration of Duchy of Courland ('), which was formally recognised by Kaiser Wilhelm on 15 March 1918. On 12 April 1918, a Provincial Assembly (') composed of 35 Baltic Germans, 13 Estonians, and 11 Latvians passed a resolution calling upon the German Emperor to recognize the Baltic provinces as a monarchy and make them a German protectorate. The United Baltic Duchy was nominally recognized as a sovereign state by emperor Wilhelm II only on 22 September 1918, half a year after Soviet Russia had formally relinquished all authority over former Russian Imperial Baltic governorates to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On 5 November 1918, a temporary Regency Council (') for the new state led by Baron Adolf Pilar von Pilchau was formed on a joint basis from the two local Land Councils. The capital of the new state was to be Riga. It was to be a confederation of seven cantons: ' (Courland), Riga, ' (Latgale), ' (South Livonia), ' (North Livonia), ' (), and ' (Estonia), the four first cantons thus covering the territory corresponding to today's Latvia and the latter three corresponding to today's Estonia. The first head of state of the United Baltic Duchy was to be Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, not as a sovereign monarch, but as a subordinate to the German , similar to other princes of the German Empire. But Adolf Friedrich never assumed office. The appointed Regency Council consisting of four Baltic Germans, three Estonians and three Latvians functioned until 28 November 1918, without any international recognition, except Germany. In October 1918, the Chancellor of Germany Prince Maximilian of Baden proposed to have the military administration in the Baltic replaced by civilian authority. The new policy was stated in a telegram from the German Foreign Office to the military administration of the Baltic: \\"The government of the Reich is unanimous in respect of the fundamental change in our policy towards the Baltic countries, namely that in the first instance policy is to be made with the Baltic peoples.\\"  Independent Estonia and Latvia  On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed independence. August Winnig, the last representative of the German government, signed an agreement with representatives of the Estonian Provisional Government about handing over power on Estonian territory on 19 November.World War I Estonica. Encyclopaedia about Estonia In Latvia, the Germans formally handed over authority to the Latvian national government headed by on 7 December 1918. The ' was formed by the government of the United Baltic Duchy as its national defense force. Upon taking command of the ', Major Alfred Fletcher, with the backing of the Baltic German land barons, began dismissing native Latvian elements and replacing them with Baltic Germans and ' troops. Concurrently, German officers assumed most of the command positions. In his book Vanguard of Nazism: The Free Corps Movement in Postwar Germany, 1918‚Äì1923, author Robert G.L. Waite notes: \\"By mid-February 1919, Latvians composed less than one-fifth of their own army\\". Britain backed down after recognizing the gravity of the military situation, and the White Russian units and the ' moved on and captured Riga on 22 May 1919. After the capture of Riga, the ' were accused of killing 300 Latvians in (), 200 in (), 125 in (), and over 3,000 in Riga. After taking part in the capture of Riga, in June 1919 General ordered his troops not to advance east against the Red Army, as the Allies had been expecting, but north, against the Estonians. On 19 June 1919, the Iron Division and ' units launched an attack to capture areas around (), the ' continued its advance towards the Estonian coast preparatory for a push on Petrograd. However, the ' was defeated by the 3rd Estonian Division (led by ) and North Latvian Brigade in the Battle of , 19‚Äì23 June 1919. On the morning of 23 June 1919, the Germans began a general retreat toward Riga. The Allies again insisted that the Germans withdraw their remaining troops from Latvia, and intervened to impose a ceasefire between the Estonians and the ' when the Estonians were about to march into Riga. Meanwhile, an Allied mission composed of British troops under General Sir Hubert de la Poer Gough had arrived in the Baltic to clear the Germans from the region and organize native armies for the Baltic states.  Aftermath  The defeat of Germany in World War I in November 1918, followed by the defeat in 1919 of the ' and German ' units of General in Latvia by the 3rd Estonian Division and North Latvian Brigade, rendered the United Baltic Duchy irrelevant. To ensure its return to Latvian control, the ' was placed under British authority. After taking command of the ' in mid-July 1919, Lt Col Harold Alexander (the future Alexander of Tunis), gradually dismissed the Baltic German elements. The Baltic nations of Estonia and Latvia were established as republics. V√µidup√ºha or Victory Day or the Victory Day in the Battle of V√µnnu is a public holiday in Estonia which takes on June 23. The holiday has been celebrated since 1934 and marks the victory of Estonia and neighboring Latvia in the Battle of Cƒìsis against the Baltische Landeswehr on June 23, 1919.

He was convicted in 2005 of illegal arms dealing after purchasing a fake surface-to-air missile from a Russian intelligence agent posing as a disgruntled military officer, then attempting to sell that missile to an informant working for FBI and posing as a Somali terrorist. Background Born in Gujarat, Lakhani moved to London in 1974. Lakhani and his wife Kusum ran a number of businesses, including an export/import business Multitrade (London) Ltd and Reliance Clothing Company Ltd. Investigations The extent of Lakhani's background in Russia remains unknown, although one of his fellow directors in the Reliance Clothing Company is known to maintain a Moscow address. He was first noticed by the FSB in March 2003 and his past is presently being investigated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation. It is thought that he approached the Dyagteryov Arms Factory to purchase the missile after researching the company on the internet. Due to a tip-off from MI6, the FSB agent posed as a representative of the company to sell him a disabled Igla missile. There is some evidence that MI6 grew interested in him after he made contact with Ukrspetsexport, an arms company suspected of supplying illegal arms to Iraq. =Criticism of American investigation= U.S. government agents were continuously involved with Lakhani's case, many claim to the point of entrapment. It is not clear that Lakhani, before allegedly being convinced by US agents, would have wished to obtain support for terrorism. It is also unclear whether Lakhani could ever have delivered on his promises of illegal arms to a government informant: When Lakhani was unable to obtain a missile, the U.S. government, acting through the intelligence community, provided him with one. Such counterterrorist strategies have been described by legal scholars as window dressing, because they target supposed enemies who are so weak as not to be a threat, and divert resources from addressing real threats. In a 2006 article in The Nation, Christopher Hayes wrote, Lakhani's involvement with U.S. government agents and intelligence has been the subject of an episode of the public radio show This American Life, aired in 2005 and 2009. Conviction Lakhani was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Chris Christie.

With its seasonally snow-capped, symmetrical cone, Misti stands at above sea level and lies between mount Chachani () and Pichu Pichu volcano (). Its last eruption was in 1985, 198 years after its previous documented eruption. Description Misti has three concentric craters. Active fumaroles, or volcanic gas vents, can be seen in the inner crater. Near the inner crater, six Inca mummies and rare Inca artifacts were found in 1998 during a month-long excavation directed by archaeologists Johan Reinhard and Jose Antonio Chavez. These findings are currently stored at the Museo de Santuarios Andinos in Arequipa. There are two main climbing routes on the volcano. The Pastores route starts at . Usually a camp is made at at Nido de Aguilas. The Aguada Blanca route starts at near the Aguada Blanca reservoir, and a camp is made at at Monte Blanco (the camp is named after Mont Blanc, the summit of which is approximately the same elevation as the camp). Neither climbing route presents technical difficulties, but both are considered strenuous because of the steep loose sand slopes. Surrounding area A long history of eruptions from Misti and its neighbour volcanoes has caused the local soil to be extremely fertile, making the surrounding area one of the most agriculturally productive in Peru.

Life =Early years= Tate was born near Winchester, Kentucky, to John Orley Tate, a businessman of Kentucky pioneer stock, and Eleanor Parke Custis Varnell, a Virginia Lady. On the Bogan side of her grandmother's family Eleanor Varnell was a distant relative of George Washington; she left Tate a copper luster pitcher that Washington had ordered from London for his sister. In 1916 and 1917 Tate studied the violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. =Vanderbilt University, Rhodes College, Kenyon College and The Fugitives= He began attending Vanderbilt University in 1918. He was the first undergraduate to be invited to join a group of men who met regularly to read and discuss their poetry: they included notably John Crowe Ransom and Donald Davidson on the faculty; James M. Frank, a prominent Nashville businessman who hosted the meetings; and Sidney Mttron-Hirsch, a Jewish mystic and playwright, who presided. In 1922 they began publishing a poetry magazine named The Fugitive; so the group was known as the Fugitives. Tate took along a younger friend to some meetings, sophomore Robert Penn Warren, who was invited to become a member in 1923. The aim of the group, according to the critic J. A. Bryant, was \\"to demonstrate that a group of southerners could produce important work in the medium [of poetry], devoid of sentimentality and carefully crafted,\\" and they wrote in the formalist tradition that valued the skillful use of meter and rhyme. When Robert Penn Warren left Southwestern College (later renamed Rhodes College) to accept a position at Louisiana State University, he recommended Tate to replace him. Tate accepted the position, and spent 1934‚Äì36 as lecturer in English at Southwestern. =1920s= He made his debut as a critic in the weekly book page Davidson edited for the Nashville Tennessean, publishing 29 reviews there during 1924. The fifth book he reviewed was An Anthology of Negro Poetry, edited by Newman Ivey White and Walter Clinton Jackson--\\"the first significant attempt\\" by \\"white critics to do justice to Negro literature in America.\\" He faulted the editors' standards of \\"refinement\\" and \\"taste.\\" \\"This of Claude McKay: 'Some of his poems are too erotic for good taste and conventional morality.' Whose good taste and whose morality?\\" It was easy \\"to understand why they overlooked altogether the work of Jean Toomer. Toomer is the finest Negro literary artist that has yet appeared in the American scene, but he is interested in the interior of Negro life, not in the pressure of American culture on the Negro.\\" In 1924, Tate moved to New York City where he met poet Hart Crane, with whom he had been exchanging correspondence for some time. Over a four-year period, he worked freelance for The Nation, and contributed to the Hound & Horn, Poetry magazine, and others. To make ends meet, he worked as a janitor. During a summer visit with the poet Robert Penn Warren in Kentucky, he began a relationship with writer Caroline Gordon. The two lived together in Greenwich Village, but moved with Hart Crane to a house in Patterson, New York, near \\"Robber Rocks,\\" the home of friends Slater and Sue Brown. Tate married Gordon in New York in May 1925. Their daughter Nancy was born in September. In 1928, along with others New York City friends, he went to Europe. In London, he visited with T. S. Eliot, whose poetry and criticism he greatly admired, and he also visited Paris. In 1928, Tate published his first book of poetry, Mr. Pope and Other Poems, which contained his most famous poem, \\"Ode to the Confederate Dead\\" (not to be confused with \\"Ode to the Confederate Dead at Magnolia Cemetery\\" by the Civil War poet Henry Timrod). That same year, Tate also published a biography Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier. Later he became tired of the \\"Ode.\\" Just before leaving for Europe in 1928, Tate described himself to John Gould Fletcher as \\"an enforced atheist\\".Thomas A. Underwood, Allen Tate: Orphan of the South, Princeton University Press, p. 154. He later told Fletcher, \\"I am an atheist, but a religious one ‚Äî which means that there is no organization for my religion.\\" He regarded secular attempts to develop a system of thought for the modern world as misguided. \\"Only God,\\" he insisted, \\"can give the affair a genuine purpose.\\"Underwood, Allen Tate, p. 157. In his essay \\"The Fallacy of Humanism\\" (1929), he criticized the New Humanists for creating a value system without investing it with any identifiable source of authority. \\"Religion is the only technique for the validation of values,\\" he wrote.Underwood, Allen Tate, p. 155 Although he was attracted to Roman Catholicism, he deferred converting. Louis D. Rubin, Jr. observes that Tate may have waited \\"because he realized that for him at this time it would be only a strategy, an intellectual act\\".Louis D. Rubin, Jr., The Wary Fugitives: Four Poets and the South, Louisiana State University Press, 1978, p. 125. In 1929, Tate published a second biography Jefferson Davis: His Rise and Fall. =1930s= After two years abroad, the Tates returned to the United States in 1930. During two months in New York Tate secured a publisher for a symposium on the South and agrarianism that he and John Crowe Ransom, Donald Davidson, Andrew Lytle, and others had been planning. In Tennessee, the Tates took up residence at Benfolly (Clarksville, Tennessee) With an antebellum mansion with a 185-acre estate attached, that had been bought for them by Allen's brother Ben, \\"who had made a lot of northern money out of coal.\\" House guests at Benfolly were frequent: Ford Madox Ford, Edmund Wilson, Louise Bogan, Phelps Putnam, Stark Young, the Howard Bakers, the Cowleys, the Ransoms, the Warrens.Ian Hamilton, Against Oblivion: Some Lives of the Twentieth Century Poets, Viking, 2002, p. 134. Meeting at Benfolly and in Nashville, Tate, Ransom, Davidson et al. completed work on their symposium, I'll Take My Stand by Twelve Southerners, published in 1930. Tate didn't like the title; he had argued for \\"Tracts Against Communism.\\" His contribution was \\"Remarks on the southern Religion\\": the Old South was a feudal society \\"without a feudal religion\\"; her Protestant \\"religious mind was inarticulate, dissenting, and schismatical.\\" In 1933 Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder and editor of Hound & Horn, wrote Tate, the Southern editor, that he \\"would like very much to know what all you people think could be done in relation to black and white.\\" . . . Was the friction \\"inevitably racial, or accidentally economic?\\" Why were sexual relations between a white man and a black woman tolerated but not the reverse? Tate stated that there was \\"absolutely no 'solution' to the race problem in the South. That is, there is no solution that will remove the tension and the oppression that the negro must feel. . . . When two such radically different races live together, one must rule. I think the negro race is an inferior race.\\" The key was social order, which served not social justice but \\"legal justice for the ruled race. . . . Liberal agitators\\" deprived \\"the negro of even the legal justice.\\" Liberal policy was like \\"that of the Reconstruction, . . . a steady campaign against the Southern social system . . . to crush absolutely the remaining power of independent agriculture.\\" As for the sexual question, \\"it is upon the sexual consent of women that the race depends for the future. . . . Under the industrial capitalist regime . . . women are no longer the very center of the social system. . . . What is to be done about all this I do not know; and I am inclined to think no one else knows.\\" During this time, Tate also became the de facto associate editor of The American Review, which was published and edited by Seward Collins. Tate believed The American Review could popularize the work of the Southern Agrarians. He objected to Collins's open support of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and condemned Fascism in an article in The New Republic in 1936. Much of Tate's major volumes of poetry were published in the 1930s, and the scholar David Havird describes this publication history in poetry as follows: > By 1937, when he published his first Selected Poems, Tate had written all of > the shorter poems upon which his literary reputation came to rest. This > collection--which brought together work from two recent volumes, Poems: > 1928-1931 (1932) and the privately printed The Mediterranean and Other Poems > (1936), as well as the early Mr. Pope--included \\"Mother and Son,\\" \\"Last Days > of Alice,\\" \\"The Wolves,\\" \\"The Mediterranean,\\" \\"Aeneas at Washington,\\" > \\"Sonnets at Christmas,\\" and the final version of \\"Ode to the Confederate > Dead.\\" While visiting in Washington in 1936, Tate was interviewed by the > Washington \\"'Post'\\": \\"South Is U.S. Literary Center, Asserts Allen Tate, > Noted Poet.\\" Havird, David. American National Biography. New York: Oxford > University Press, 1999. Copyright ¬© 1999 by the American Council of Learned > Societies. Ford Madox Ford dedicated his book \\"Provence\\" to Caroline Gordon and Tate writing 'who came to Provence and there wrote to \\"That Sweet Land\\" the poem called \\"The Mediterranean\\" and where we went in the boat was a long bay\\". Tate and Herbert Agar in 1936 put together a symposium entitled Who Owns America? A New Declaration of Independence (Houghton Mifflin); the 21 contributors included eight Agrarians, three economists, a woman psychologist, and an English Distributist. The book made the bestseller list; it was reissued in 1999 by ISI Books. In 1936 also Scribner's published Tate's Reactionary Essays on Poetry and Idea; Maxwell Perkins, editor to both Tate and Caroline Gordon, told Tate, \\"It is an honor to publish this book.\\" In 1938 Tate published his only novel, The Fathers, which drew upon knowledge of his mother's ancestral home and family in Fairfax County, Virginia. =1940s= Tate was the poet-in- residence at Princeton University, 1939-1942, and founded the university's Creative Writing Program. He established the Mesures Lectures. During 1940-41 he was also a regular panelist, with Mark Van Doren and Huntington Cairns, on the popular CBS radio program \\"'Invitation to Learning,\\"' and sometimes a guest the following year. Random House published the transcripts. The Tates moved to Monteagle, Tennessee in 1942 to write, living on publishers' advances (Caroline Gordon was a novelist). Robert Lowell and Jean Stafford joined them. Andrew Lytle was teaching history at the nearby University of the South and was made editor of the Sewanee Review for a year; Tate helped him by getting poems and articles from Wallace Stevens, William Meredith, and others. In 1943 Tate was appointed the first rotating Chair of Poetry at the Library of Congress, where he established the Associate Fellows in American Letters. He initiated recordings of 16th and 17th century English lyrics and modern American poetry from Emily Dickinson to Karl Shapiro for Books for the Blind. He reviewed Shapiro's first book of poems, Person, Place and Thing, for the magazine Common Sense in 1943, writing the review as a letter to Sgt. Shapiro, then stationed in Australia, mixing some compositional advice with high praise (\\"May I list here certain poems that for me are already placed among the best poetry of our time?\\"), and beginning a long friendship. Tate was known for his aid to talented younger writers: John Berryman, Joseph Frank, Robert Lowell, William Meredith, Howard Nemerov, Delmore Schwartz (known as \\"the Jewish Allen Tate\\"), and Peter Taylor. He edited the Sewanee Review from 1944 to 1946. Publishing Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Jacques Maritain, T. S. Eliot, John Peale Bishop, Malcom Cowley, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, R. P. Blackmur, John Berryman, Dylan Thomas, Peter Taylor, and others, he greatly increased the magazine's circulation and made it one of the foremost quarterlies in the English language. Tate and Caroline Gordon were divorced in 1945 and remarried in 1946. Though devoted to one another for life, they could not get along and would divorce again in 1959. Divorced and remarried, the Tates lived in New York from 1946 to 1951. Tate published Poems 1922-1947. It included the long \\"Seasons of the Soul,\\" written during World War II, which he valued more highly than the \\"Ode.\\" He was editor of belle lettres at Henry Holt and Co. for two years, a lecturer at NYU for four years. He received an honorary Litt.D. from the University of Louisville in 1948. He was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1949. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1949. He would try without success until the end of his life to get Gordon elected to the Institute. =1950s= In 1950, Tate converted to Roman Catholicism.Henry L. Carrigan, Jr., \\"Three Catholic Writers of the South\\", The Christian Century, February 26, 1986, pp. 216‚Äì17. His godfather was the philosopher Jacques Maritain, who had been his friend at Princeton for several years. Caroline Gordon had joined the Church in 1947. Following the Tates into the Church later were their daughter and son-in-law, Nancy and Percy Wood; their old Tennessee friends Brainard and Francis Cheney; and their friend George Frederick Morgan, Tate's former Princeton student and editor of the Hudson Review. In 1951, six weeks after his baptism, Tate, writing \\"as a Catholic,\\" published a letter in The New York Times objecting to Cardinal Spellman's banning the Italian film The Miracle. Maritain told him, \\"Only you would have had the nerve to fight Spellman.\\" The Supreme Court in 1952 struck down New York State's ban of The Miracle, Justice Frankfurter citing Tate's letter to the NYT. When Robert Penn Warren resigned from the University of Minnesota to go to Yale in 1951, the university offered the position to Tate. Tate was one of six U.S. delegates in 1952, including William Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, and W. H. Auden, to the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Paris. Later that year he was sent by the State Dept. to the UNESCO Conference on the Arts in Venice; in Rome he had an audience with Pope Pius XII. He was a Fulbright Lecturer in Rome, 1953‚Äì54, and was the first Writer in Residence at the American Academy there. He was awarded honorary Litt. D. degrees by Coe College (1955) and Colgate University (1956). He was awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry for 1956. During the summers he taught at Harvard and Brandeis. In 1958 he was awarded the Christian Culture Gold Medal in Canada \\"as an outstanding lay exponent of Christian ideals.\\" He was a Fulbright Lecturer at Oxford and Leeds, 1958-59. Caroline Gordon was granted a divorce in Minneapolis for desertion in 1959. Tate four days later married the poetess and Boston heiress Isabella Gardner at Wellfleet on the Cape; his friend Francis Biddle, the attorney general under Roosevelt, was best man. In Minneapolis Tate had been living in the Oak Grove Hotel; Isabella bought and furnished a house. Her two children from two previous husbands lived with them from time to time. \\"Homage to Allen Tate,\\" honoring his 60th birthday, was published in the Autumn 1959 Sewanee Review, including contributions by Ransom, Lytle, Cowley, Eliot, Blackmur, Porter, Van Doren, Davidson, and Lowell. =1960s= \\"'Allen Tate Reads from His Own Works'\\" helped launch the Yale Series of Recorded Poets in 1960. That year Tate edited Selected Poems of John Peale Bishop (Chatto & Windus), and The Fathers was reprinted (Eyre & Spottiswood and Swallow). The Times Literary Supplement said it was \\"possibly one of the great novels of our time'\\" and Encounter and the New Statesman published long review-articles by Frank Kermode and Janet Adam Smith. Tate said, \\"The British read the book as I conceived it--not as 'another Southern novel.'\\" He received an honorary Litt.D. from the University of Kentucky in 1960. He published Poems in 1960, adding two poems in terza rima, \\"The Swimmers\\" and \\"The Buried Lake.\\" T. S. Eliot said Tate's were the best terza rima poems in English. The Tates were invited to the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Jackie Kennedy told Tate, \\"Oh, I took your picture!\\" (she had once been a newspaper photographer). Tate was awarded the Brandeis Creative Arts Medal in Poetry in 1961 for lifetime achievement. When the issue of integration came to a new crisis in riots in 1962 at Ole Miss, Tate, Davidson, Warren, and Charlie Foster, Tate's colleague and close friend from New England, exchanged views. Tate was \\"in favor of Negro rights\\" but thought \\"the Supreme Court has gone about it from the wrong end. The vote is the thing; school integration, even for those who want it, will never be solidly based without the Negro vote.\\" He was annoyed \\"that the Southern Way of Life becomes a popular cause only when race relations are upset.\\" Italians awarded Tate the Dante Alighieri Society's Gold Medal for 1962. Carleton College awarded him an honorary Litt.D. in 1963. The Tates spent their summer vacations in England and Italy, seeing among others the Eliots, Louis MacNeice, Yvor Richards, W. H. Auden, Graham Greene, the Joseph Franks, Edith Sitwell, the Herbert Reeds, the Roy Fullers, the C. Day Lewises, and the Stephen Spenders, who gave them a cocktail party in 1962. Isabella met Natasha Spender, with whom Tate had had an affair. Tate remained friends with the Spenders until his death as well as with Elizabeth Hardwick, his other serious affair during his marriage with Caroline Gordon. Tate brought \\"a procession of distinguished visitors to Minneapolis,\\" Charlie Foster said, and the cocktail parties the Tates had for them allowed faculty and sometimes graduate students to meet them: it was \\"a kind of salon.\\" Isabella's two children were a constant problem. Rose worked as a belly dancer in San Francisco and Puerto Rico, got engaged to a Mexican bullfighter until an Embassy investigation proved him a fraud. Dan, a freshman at the University of Minnesota, disappeared and turned up in a hospital in Baltimore. Isabella gave a large dinner party for Tate's 65th birthday, inviting 26 guests. Tate was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which had only 50 members, in 1964. He was the subject of a long illustrated article leading off the arts section of the Sunday Minneapolis Tribune for Jan. 24, 1965. It said Tate \\"is one Southern conservative who is not enamored with Barry Goldwater. 'Goldwater is a fine example of the complete decay of conservatism,' Tate said, his oversize head shaking sadly. 'I'd prefer the welfare state to his caricature.'\\" He moved back into the Oak Grove Hotel after Isabella learned that he had been having an affair with a graduate student, Helen Heinz, a nun who was assistant director of nursing at a county hospital. He edited a special Eliot issue of the Sewanee Review, which was reissued as a book in 1966, T.S. Eliot, the Man and His Work. He was named the first Regents Professor of English at Minnesota. Isabella divorced him in March 1966; he and Helen were married in July in Tennessee. He was a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, fall 1966, and at Vanderbilt, spring 1967. For Francis Biddle's 80th birthday dinner in Washington, Tate delivered a greeting speech in Latin. He sold his papers to the Firestone Library at Princeton; the proceeds would help build a new house for his retirement at Sewanee. Twin sons, John and Michael, were born prematurely to the Tates in Nashville in August 1967. Tate was elected president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He delivered the principal address at Ransom's 80th birthday celebration at Kenyon College. Upon his retirement from Minnesota in June 1968 the family moved to Sewanee. While the Tates were at Lytle's for dinner one evening in July, the baby sitter allowed Michael to choke to death in his crib on a toy telephone. Tate resigned as president of the National Institute in November 1968 because of the tiring trips to New York. He edited The Complete Poems and Selected Criticism of Edgar Allen Poe (New American Library) and published Essays of Four Decades (Swallow and Oxford). He received an honorary D.Litt. from North Carolina at Greensboro in 1969. In December another son was born, Benjamin Lewis Bogan Tate. = 1970s = Tate gave the annual Joseph Warren Beach Memorial Lecture at the University of Minnesota in 1970 and read at the Poetry International Festival in London. He and Helen spent two weeks in Italy; in Florence he attended the dinner celebrating Alfredo Rizzardi's translation of Ode to the Confederate Dead and Other Poems. He received an honorary D.Litt. from the University of the South. He published The Swimmers and Other Selected Poems (Oxford and Scribners) in 1971. He lectured at Greensboro for two weeks in 1970 and 1971 and at Harvard for four days in 1971. He was earning as much as he could by lecturing because the annuity his brother Ben left him would expire after his death. He had to cancel his Hopwood Awards Lecture at the University of Michigan in 1972 when he was hospitalized at the Vanderbilt Hospital for ten days with bronchitis and emphysema; Caroline Gordon substituted for him. David McDowell at Crown Publishers recommended Tate to the Nobel Prize Committee in literature. Tate received a medal for distinction in literature from the University of South Carolina. He was sick when he delivered the three Gauss Lectures for 1973 at Princeton; he collapsed afterwards and was in the hospital at Princeton for ten days with emphysema. In 1974 he gave a lecture at the Library of Congress on the centenary of Frost's birth. Tate's 75th birthday was celebrated two days at Sewanee and one evening in London. At Sewanee the program included Denis Donoghue, Cleanth Brooks, Howard Nemerov, William Jay Smith, Radcliffe Squires, Walter Sullivan, Louis Rubin, and Lewis Simpson. Tate wasn't allowed to attend the public events but, though weak, was engaging and witty at the social events which included his friends Eudora Welty, Joseph Frank, Francis Fergusson, and others. In London at the Mermaid Theatre Stephen Spender presided at a panel including I. A. Richards, Roy Fuller, and Robert Lowell, followed by a party in the Green Room. Tate was hospitalized at Vanderbilt for three weeks in 1975 following a coma; he was now bedridden. His Memoirs and Opinions, 1926-1974, was published by Swallow. He received the Ingram Merrill Foundation's Award in Literature for 1975. In 1976 he was awarded the National Medal for Literature; William Jay Smith accepted it for him. The Tates moved to Nashville to be near Allen's lung specialist. They took a vow of celibacy and were received back into the Church. Tate had numerous visitors to his small room; on the walls were pictures of Ransom and Eliot, \\"my two masters.\\" He was connected to an oxygen tank. Collected Poems, 1916-1976 was published in 1977 by Farrar, Straus, & Giroux. It was awarded the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for the best book of poems in 1977. Tate died in the Vanderbilt Hospital February 9, 1979. He was buried at Sewanee. Attitudes on race Literary scholars have questioned the relationship between the cultural attitudes of Modernist poets on issues such as race and the writing produced by the poets. The 1930s saw Tate's most notable stances on matters that may or may not be connected to literary craft. For example, though Tate spoke well of the work of fellow Modernist poet Langston Hughes, in 1931, Tate pressured his colleague Thomas Mabry into canceling a reception for Hughes, comparing the idea of socializing with the black poet to meeting socially with his black cook.Arnold Rampersad, The Life of Langston Hughes, Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 231. In 1930s Tate held prejudices against blacks. He expressed views against interracial marriage and miscegenation and refused to associate with black writers (like the aforementioned Langston Hughes).Thomas Underwood. Allen Tate: Orphan of the South, Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 291. Tate also believed in white supremacy.Allen Tate, \\"A View of the White South\\", The American Review 2:4 (February 1934).See also Hamilton, Against Oblivion, pp. 135-36.Allen Tate: Orphan of the South, Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 151. Underwood (p. 291) doesn't, however, quote Lincoln Kirstein's reply to Tate's letter (see the 1930)s: \\"The most lucid and carefully thought out attitude that I have ever seen in regard to the whole business.\\" According to the critic Ian Hamilton, Tate and his co-agrarians had been more than ready at the time to overlook the anti-Semitism of the American Review in order to promote their 'spiritual' defense of the Deep South's traditions. In a 1934 review, \\"A View of the Whole South\\",Allen Tate, The American Review 2:4 (February 1934) Tate reviews W. T. Couch's \\"Culture in The South: A Symposium by Thirty-one Authors\\" and defends racial hegemony: \\"I argue it this way: the white race seems determined to rule the Negro race in its midst; I belong to the white race; therefore I intend to support white rule. Lynching is a symptom of weak, inefficient rule; but you can't destroy lynching by fiat or social agitation; lynching will disappear when the white race is satisfied that its supremacy will not be questioned in social crises.\\" According to David Yezzi, who teaches at Johns Hopkins, Tate held the conventional social views of a white Southerner in 1934: an \\"inherited racism, a Southern legacy rooted in place and time that Tate later renounced.\\" Tate was born of a Scotch-Irish lumber manager whose business failures required moving several times per year, Tate said of his upbringing \\"\\"we might as well have been living, and I been born, in a tavern at a crossroads.\\"Paul V. Murphy, The Rebuke of History: The Southern Agrarians and American Conservative Thought. University of North Carolina Press, 2001, p. 32 However, his views on race were not passively incorporated; Thomas Underwood documents Tate's pursuit of racist ideology: \\"Tate also drew ideas from nineteenth-century proslavery theorists such as Thomas Roderick Dew, a professor at The College of William and Mary, and William Harper, of the University of South Carolina ‚Äî \\"We must revive these men, he said.\\" In the 1930s Tate was infuriated when another writer implied that he was a fascist.

Ancient Phaistos was located about east of the Mediterranean Sea and south of Heraklio, the second largest city of Minoan Crete. The name Phaistos survives from ancient Greek references to a city in Crete of that name at or near the current ruins. The name is substantiated by the coins of the classical city. They display motifs such as Europa sitting on a bull, Talos with wings, Heracles without beard and being crowned, and Zeus in the form of a naked youth sitting on a tree. On either the obverse or the reverse the name of the city, or its abbreviation, is inscribed, such as or , for Phaistos or Phaistios (\\"Phaistian\\" adjective) written either right-to-left or left-to-right. These few dozen coins were acquired by collectors from uncontrolled contexts. They give no information on the location of Phaistos.  Archaeology  Phaistos was located by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, commander of the Spitfire, a paddle steamer, in the Mediterranean Survey of 1853, which described the topography, settlements and monuments of Crete. Spratt followed the directions of Strabo, who said:Geography Book X, Chapter 4. > Of the three cities that were united under one metropolis by Minos, the > third, which was Phaestus, was razed to the ground by the Gortynians; it is > sixty stadia distant from Gortyn, twenty from the sea, and forty from the > seaport Matalum; and the country is held by those who razed it. The simple geometric problem posed by these distances from known points was solved with no difficulty by the survey. The location pinpointed was the eastern end of a hill, or ridge, rising from the middle of the Geropotamos river valley extending from the sea to the Messara Plain in an east‚Äìwest direction. The hill was called Kastri (\\"fort\\", \\"small castle\\"). A military man, Spratt understood the significance of the location immediately: > I thus found that Phaestus had occupied the extremity of a ridge that > divides the maritime plain of Debaki from the plain of the Messara, so as to > command the narrow valley of communication. A village of 16 houses remained on the ridge, but the vestiges of fortification walls indicated a city had once existed there. A half-century later, after removing the houses, Federico Halbherr and his crew began to discover the remains of an extensive palace complex. As he had begun excavation before Arthur Evans at Knossos in 1900, he did not have the advantage of Evans' concepts of Minoan civilization nor the knowledge acquired after the decipherment of the Linear B syllabary by Michael Ventris. Excavation ended in 1904, to begin again after another half-century, in 1950. By this time it was understood that the palace had been constructed at the beginning of the Proto-Palace Period. After 1955 the place name, , pa-i-to, interpreted as Phaistos (written in Mycenaean Greek), began to turn up in the Linear B tablets at Knossos, then under the Mycenaean Greeks. There was every reason to think that pa-i-to was located at Kastri. No Linear B has been found at Phaistos, but tradition and the Knossos tablets suggest that Phaistos was a dependency of Knossos. Moreover, only a few pieces of Linear A have been found. As Phaistos appears to have been an administrative center, the lack of records is surprising. In 1908, Pernier found the Phaistos Disc in the basements of the northern group of the palace. This artifact is a clay disk, dated to between 1950 BC and 1400 BC and impressed with a unique, sophisticated hieroglyphic script. The tombs of the rulers of Phaistos were found in a cemetery 20 minutes away from the palace remains. Bronze Age Phaistos was inhabited from about 4000 BC. A palace, dating from the Middle Bronze Age, was destroyed by an earthquake during the Late Bronze Age. Knossos along with other Minoan sites was destroyed at that time. The palace was rebuilt toward the end of the Late Bronze Age. The first palace was built about 2000 BC. This section is on a lower level than the west courtyard and has a nice facade with a plastic outer shape, a cobbled courtyard, and a tower ledge with a ramp, which leads up to a higher level. The old palace was destroyed three times in period of about three centuries. After the first and second disaster, reconstruction and repairs were made, so there are distinguished three construction phases. The Old Palace was built in the Protopalatial Period,Phaistos Palace, Ian Swindale Retrieved 12 May 2013 then rebuilt twice due to extensive earthquake damage. When the palace was destroyed by earthquakes, the re-builders constructed a New Palace atop the old. Several artifacts with Linear A inscriptions were excavated at this site. The name of the site also appears in partially deciphered Linear A texts, and is probably similar to Mycenaean 'PA-I-TO' as written in Linear B. Several kouloura structures (subsurface pits) have been found at Phaistos. Pottery has been recovered at Phaistos from in the Middle and Late Minoan periods, including polychrome items and embossing in imitation of metal work. Bronze Age works from Phaistos include bridge spouted bowls, eggshell cups, tall jars and large pithoi.C. Michael Hogan, Phaistos Fieldnotes, The Modern Antiquarian (2007) In one of the three hills of the area, remains of the middle neolithic age have been found, and a part of the palace was built during the Early Minoan period. Another two palaces seems to have been built at the Middle and Late Minoan Age. The older looks like the Minoan palace of Knossos, although this is smaller. An earthquake c. 18th century BC destroyed the palace but a larger palace of the later Minoan period was built on the ruins around 1700 BC, consisting of several rooms separated by columns. The levels of the theater area, in conjunction with two splendid staircases, gave a grand access to the main hall of the propylaea through high doors. A twin gate led directly to the central courtyard through a wide street. The floors and walls of the interior rooms were decorated with plates of sand and white gypsum stone. Upper floors of the west sector had spacious ceremonial rooms, although their exact restoration was not possible. A brilliant entrance from the central courtyard led to the royal apartments in the north part of the palace, with a view of the tops of Psiloritis. The rooms were constructed from alabaster and other materials. The rooms for princes were smaller and less luxurious than the rooms of the royal departments. Around 1400 BC, the invading Achaeans destroyed Phaistos, as well as Knossos. The palace appears to have been unused thereafter, as evidence of the Mycenaean era have not been found. Iron Age References to Phaistos in ancient Greek literature are quite frequent. Phaistos is first referenced by Homer as \\"well populated\\",Iliad, B 648, Odyssey, C 269 and the Homeric epics indicate its participation in the Trojan War.Homer Iliad Book II. Catalogue of Ships (2.494-759) The historian Diodorus Siculus indicatesDiodorus Siculus Bibliotheca historica that Phaistos, together with Knossos and Kydonia, are the three towns that were founded by King Minos on Crete. Instead, Pausanias and Stephanus of Byzantium supported in their texts that the founder of the city was Phaestos, son of Hercules or Ropalus.Pausanias Description of Greece, Book II: Corinth (IV, 7) The city of Phaistos is associated with the mythical king of Crete Rhadamanthys. The site was reinhabited during the Geometric Age (8th century BC). Phaistos had its own currency and had created an alliance with other autonomous Cretan cities, and with the king of Pergamon Eumenes II. Around the end of the 3rd century BC, Phaestos was destroyed by the Gortynians and since then ceased to exist in the history of Crete. Scotia Aphrodite and goddess Leto, who was also called Phytia, were worshiped there. The people of Phaistos were distinguished for their funny adages. Epimenides, the wise man invited by the Athenians to clean the city after the Cylonian affair (Cyloneio agos) in the 6th century BC, was of Phaistian descent.

Early years  Jos√© Bustamante was born in Arequipa. His parents were Manuel Bustamante y Barreda, a lawyer and district attorney in Arequipa, and Victoria de Rivero y Romero. Jos√© married Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Rivera in 1923. He received his early education in Arequipa at Colegio San Jos√© and obtained his Law Degree from the Universidad Nacional San Agust√≠n de Arequipa in his native city and his Ph.D. from the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad in Cusco. After a distinguished career as a professor and legal scholar, Bustamante became interested in politics. Coup against Legu√≠a Bustamante reached political maturity as the author of the manifesto which launched the 1930 coup that ousted President Augusto B. Legu√≠a. He soon earned the trust of Legu√≠a's successor, Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro, and began his new career in 1934 by serving as a diplomat, representing Peru as Peruvian Minister to Bolivia (1934-1938, 1942-1945) and Uruguay (1939-1942). He ran for President in 1945 as a candidate for the Frente Democr√°tico Nacional, a moderate, left-of-center party that aligned itself with V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre's APRA and the Peruvian Communist Party. Opposing him was the Legi√≥n Patri√≥tica Independiente candidate, Gen. Eloy G. Ureta. Bustamante comfortably won the relatively honest election. Presidency During his first seven days as President, Bustamante restored press freedom and full civil rights and freed all political prisoners. He also purged the Military, cancelled gambling licenses and took control of the expenditures of the national treasury. One of his important international agreements was to establish a 200-mile stretch of Peruvian sea. As president, Bustamante hoped to create a more democratic government by limiting the power of the military and the oligarchy. Conflict soon arose, however, between the president and Haya de la Torre. Without the support of the APRA party Bustamante found his presidency severely limited. The murder of the ultraconservative Editor Francisco Gra√±a Garland, a prominent member of the Peruvian Elite (and bitter editorial enemy of the APRA Party), sparked a political crisis that was blamed immediately on the APRA's influence on the Government. President Bustamante y Rivero was forced to name a military Cabinet to tide over the crisis. In October 1948, rebel sailors and officers seized five warships, locked up or shot their commanders, sent landing parties ashore under cover of a ragged bombardment. Shore-based sailors took over the Naval Academy, the Naval Armory, and the Real Felipe Fortress. After troops loyal to the government crushed the revolt, President Bustamante suspended all civil rights. The insurrection, he declared, had been the work of the APRA Party. Under the President's orders, government troops occupied the APRA headquarters, seized the plant of its newspaper, La Tribuna, and arrested several prominent Apristas. But for the Military Cabinet, those moves were not enough. Postwar economic problems and strife caused by strong labor unions led to a military coup on October 29, 1948, which led Gen. Manuel A. Odr√≠a to become the new President.  Post-presidency  While in exile, Bustamante resided in Buenos Aires, Madrid and Paris. On February 9, 1956, while Odr√≠a still in power, Bustamante returned to Peru, causing Peruvians great surprise. In 1960 he was elected a member of the International Court of Justice in The Hague and served as its President from 1967 to 1969. In 1969, due to his recognition as an international jurist, the Organization of American States designated Bustamante as a mediator in the border conflict between El Salvador and Honduras known as the Football War, which ended peacefully after a peace treaty was signed on October 30, 1980 in Lima, Peru. As a former president of Peru, Bustamante was ultimately elected senator for life from 1980 to 1989, as established by the Peruvian Constitution of 1979. He died in Lima in 1989, aged 94, four days before his 95th birthday. Published works Jos√© Bustamante was the author of several judicial and other related works currently in the National Library of Peru.

In the 1830s Canada covered an area considerably smaller than today. At the time, most of Upper Canada had not been explored by European settlers. Throughout her long life, Traill wrote to generate income in support of her family. She wrote 24 books covering topics ranging from her life as a settler in Ontario, and natural history, especially botany. Traill is considered a pioneer of Canada's natural history. Through her writing she related the colonial experience and described the natural environment of Upper Canada for English readers. Traill is considered an amateur botanist, because at the time, it was not possible for women to hold professional, paid positions. In 1912, Carrie Derick became Canada's first woman science professor, in Botany and Genetics, at McGill University . Early years Mrs Catharine Parr Traill by William James Topley Catharine Parr Strickland was born in the district of Rotherhithe in Southwark (then in Surrey, today part of Greater London) in 1802, fifth daughter of Thomas Strickland and Elizabeth Homer. She grew up in East Anglia, first near Bungay, and later Southwold and was educated at home. After Thomas Strickland died in 1818, Catharine and her sisters turned to writing and editorial work as the main source of family income. Career Sister to fellow authors Agnes Strickland, Jane Margaret Strickland, Susanna Moodie, and Elisabeth Strickland, Traill was the first of her siblings to commence writing. She began writing children's books in 1818 after the death of her father. Traill's first book The tell tale: an original collection of moral and amusing stories appeared anonymously in 1818; she was only 16. Her early works, such as Disobedience, or Mind What Mama Says (1819) and \\"Happy Because Good\\", were written for children, and often dwell on the benefits of obedience to one's parents. A prolific author, until her marriage she averaged one book per year. In 1832, she married Lieutenant Thomas Traill, a retired officer of the Napoleonic Wars and a friend of her sister's husband, John Moodie, despite objections from her family (aside from Susanna). Soon after their marriage, they left for Upper Canada, settling near Peterborough, where her brother Samuel was a surveyor. Her sister, Mrs. Susanna Moodie, emigrated soon afterwards. She described her new life in letters and journals and collected these into The Backwoods of Canada (1836), which continues to be read as an important source of information about early Canada. She describes everyday life in the community, the relationship between Canadians, Americans, and Indigenous peoples, the climate, and local flora and fauna. Agnes Chamberlin's watercolour painting for Studies of Plant Life in Canada, by Catherine Parr Traill More observations were included in a novel, Canadian Crusoes (1851). She also collected information concerning the skills necessary for a new settler, published in The Female Emigrant's Guide (1854), later retitled The Canadian Settler's Guide. She wrote \\"Pearls and Pebbles\\" and \\"Cot and Cradle Stories\\". After suffering through the depression of 1836, her husband Thomas joined the militia in 1837 to fight against the Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1840, dissatisfied with life in \\"the backwoods,\\" the Traills and the Moodies both moved to the city of Belleville. While Susanna was more concerned with the differences between rural and urban life, Catharine spent her years in Belleville writing about the natural environment. She often sketched the plant life of Upper Canada, publishing Canadian Wild Flowers (1865), Studies of Plant Life in Canada (1885) and \\"Rambles in the Canadian Forest\\". She received a grant c. 1899 from the Royal Bounty Fund, which was supplemented by a subscription from her friends in Canada, headed by Sir Sandford Fleming. She died at her residence, \\"Westove,\\" in Lakefield, Ontario on 28 August 1899. Her many albums of plant collections are housed in the National Herbarium of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature. =Recognition= Trent University, in Peterborough, Ontario, named their downtown campus after her. Catharine Parr Traill College is the University's main college for graduate studies. =Commemorative postage stamp= On 8 September 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, \\"The Writers of Canada\\", designed by Katalina Kovats and featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps.

The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action, side effects, interactions, mobility and toxicity. At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and understanding of the pathological process. Some specialties of pharmacists, such as that of clinical pharmacists, require other skills, e.g. knowledge about the acquisition and evaluation of physical and laboratory data. The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care, including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information. Pharmacists, therefore, are the experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients. An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a pharmacy (this term is more common in the United States) or a chemist's (which is more common in Great Britain, though pharmacy is also used) . In the United States and Canada, drugstores commonly sell medicines, as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products and magazines and occasionally refreshments and groceries. In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the apothecary may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology, prior to the formulation of the scientific method. Disciplines Pharmacy, Tacuinum sanitatis casanatensis (14th century) The field of pharmacy can generally be divided into three primary disciplines: *Pharmaceutics *Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy *Pharmacy Practice The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut. Often, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology. Pharmacology is sometimes considered as the 4th discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient- oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline. Pharmacoinformatics is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety. Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs. Professionals The World Health Organization estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.World Health Organization. World Health Statistics 2011 ‚Äì Table 6: Health workforce, infrastructure, and essential medicines. Geneva, 2011. Accessed 21 July 2011. =Pharmacists= Convent pharmacy exhibited at the Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci of Milan. Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialized education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small-business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual. Pharmacists are represented internationally by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). They are represented at the national level by professional organisations such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the UK, Pharmacy Guild of Australia (PSA), Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA), Indian Pharmacist Association (IPA), Pakistan Pharmacists Association (PPA), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). (See also: List of pharmacy associations.) In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and ethics of the profession. In the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties include: cardiovascular, infectious disease, oncology, pharmacotherapy, nuclear, nutrition, and psychiatry.Board of Pharmacy Specialties, Current Specialties The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied toxicology. Pharmacy Support Staff =Pharmacy technicians= Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic's offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises. In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications. Some states have a legally mandated pharmacist-to- pharmacy technician ratio. =Dispensing Assistants= Dispensing assistants are commonly referred to as \\"dispensers\\" and in community pharmacies perform largely the same tasks as a pharmacy technician. They work under the supervision of pharmacists and are involved in preparing (dispensing and labelling) medicines for provision to patients. =Healthcare Assistants/Medicines Counter Assistants= In the UK, this group of staff can sell certain medicines (including pharmacy only and general sales list medicines) over the counter. They cannot prepare prescription-only medicines for supply to patients.  Education requirements  There are different requirements of schooling according to the national jurisdiction where the student intends to practise. =United States= In the United States, general pharmacist will attain a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (Pharm.D.). The Pharm.D. can be completed in a minimum of six years, which includes two years of pre-pharmacy classes, and four years of professional studies. After graduating pharmacy school, it is highly suggested that the student go on to complete a one or two-year residency, which provides valuable experience for the student before going out independently to be a generalized or specialized pharmacist. The curriculum specified for a Pharm.D. consists of at least 208-credit hours. Of the 208-credit hours, 68 are transferred-credit hours, and the remaining 140-credit hours are completed in the professional school. There are a series of required standardized tests that students have to pass throughout the process of pharmacy school. The standardized test to get into pharmacy school in the United States is called the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). In a student's third professional year in pharmacy school, it is required to pass the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA). Once the Pharm.D. is attained after the fourth year professional school, the student is then eligible to take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Exam (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE) to work as a professional pharmacist.

The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the Sushruta Samhita, an Indian Ayurvedic treatise attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD. Many Sumerian (late 6th millennium BC ‚Äì early 2nd millennium BC) cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine. Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of the 16th century BC. De Materia Medica, Byzantium, 15th century In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic.Edward Kremers, Glenn Sonnedecker (1986). \\"Kremers and Urdang's History of pharmacy\\". Amer. Inst. History of Pharmacy. p.17. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five-volume book in his native Greek Œ†ŒµœÅŒØ œçŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances) was used as a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age. Pharmacy in China dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the Shennong Bencao Jing (The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the Han dynasty and was attributed to the mythical Shennong. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \\"Recipes for 52 Ailments\\", found in the Mawangdui, sealed in 168 BC. In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538‚Äì710) and the early Nara period (710‚Äì794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih≈ç Code (701) and re-stated in the Y≈çr≈ç Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists‚Äîand even pharmacist assistants‚Äîwere assigned status superior to all others in health- related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834) Annales des empereurs du Japon, p. 434. There is a stone sign for a pharmacy with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus near Kusadasi in Turkey. The current Ephesus dates back to 400 BC and was the site of the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world. In Baghdad the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754, under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. By the 9th century, these pharmacies were state-regulated. The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (Rhazes) (865‚Äì915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al- Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936‚Äì1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973‚Äì1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008‚Äì1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250‚Äì1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.Levey M. (1973), ‚Äò Early Arabic Pharmacology', E. J. Brill; Leiden. In Europe, pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240, emperor Frederic II issued a decree by which the physician's and the apothecary's professions were separated. Town Hall Pharmacy in Tallinn, operating continuously from at least 1422, showing the Bowl of Hygieia There are pharmacies in Europe that have been in operation since medieval times. In Dubrovnik (Croatia), a pharmacy that first opened in 1317 is located inside the Franciscan monastery: it is oldest operating pharmacy in Europe. In the Town Hall Square of Tallinn (Estonia), there is a pharmacy dating from at least 1422. The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Ll√≠via, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerd√†, is a museum: the building dates back to the 15th century and the museum keeps albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs. Typical American drug store with a soda fountain, about 1905 Collingsworth County Museum and Art Center across from the courthouse in Wellington, Texas Practice areas Pharmacists practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, extended care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and regulatory agencies. Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a medical specialty. =Community pharmacy= 19th-century Italian pharmacy Classic symbols at the wall of a former German pharmacy Modern pharmacy in Norway Drug store interior, Toledo, Ohio, United Stats, 1900s A pharmacy (also known as a chemist in Australia, New Zealand and the British Isles; or drugstore in North America; retail pharmacy in industry terminology; or apothecary, historically) is where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers. Community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by Muslim pharmacists in Baghdad in 754 AD.Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine, 2004 (3), pp. 3‚Äì9 [8]. In most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. It was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, but there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians, with the pharmacist spending more time communicating with patients. Pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues. Pharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on-duty at all times when they are open. It is also often a requirement for the owner of a pharmacy to be a registered pharmacist, but that is not the case in all jurisdictions, such that many retailers (including supermarkets and mass merchandisers) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store. Likewise, many pharmacies are now rather grocery store-like in their design. In addition to medicines and prescriptions, many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as cosmetics, shampoo, office supplies, confections, snack foods, durable medical equipment, greeting cards, and provide photo processing services. Community pharmacies offer a unique added value by building direct relationships with their customers. They are able to provide more personalized, dedicated care to local members of their community and even offer enhanced services such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM), Medication Synchronization, and compounding. With the aid of pharmacy management systems and different integrated technologies, these smaller pharmacies are able to keep up with their large-scale competition. In community pharmacy, prescriptions, medical devices and other over the counter products are dispensed by community pharmacists. Community pharmacists may be confronted with numerous ethical problems in their daily work. Ethical issues may exist while dispensing medications based on prescription and over the counter products. Community pharmacists‚Äô understanding of ethics, confidentiality, patient autonomy, trustworthiness and reliability may be the dynamics that affect community pharmacists‚Äô values which may influence their decision making during ethical dilemmas. Most of the pharmacists face the ethical dilemma situations may be at least once a week in their pharmacies. Community pharmacists may compromise on their values and ethical issues may not only because of patient's or physician's request but may also because of their employers' intrusion. Individual factors such as age, gender, work experience, and educational level and organizational factors such as the number of pharmacists in a pharmacy and location of pharmacy may influence the ethical dilemma of community pharmacists. =Hospital pharmacy= Pharmacies within hospitals differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues. Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy. For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more. Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities. Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible. =Clinical pharmacy= Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention. Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection. The clinical pharmacist's role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan. =Ambulatory care pharmacy= Since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states. In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP. =Compounding pharmacy/industrial pharmacy= Compounding involves preparing drugs in forms that are different from the generic prescription standard. This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form. Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need. One area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead. Another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical pharmacist practitioner. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy. Compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies. =Consultant pharmacy= Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. \\"cognitive services\\") than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non- institutional settings.American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, Frequently Asked Questions Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare or PharMerica. This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services. The main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990. =Internet pharmacy= Canisters of pills from a mail order pharmacy. Since about the year 2000, a growing number of Internet pharmacies have been established worldwide. Many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies, and in fact, many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door. The primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take. Internet pharmacies (also known as online pharmacies) are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are home-bound. While most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, some Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription. Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \\"inconvenience\\" of visiting a doctor, or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products. Of particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain controlled substances (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship. There are instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \\"patient\\" s/he has never met. In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also heavily involved in monitoring internet pharmacies and has issued warnings against several companies who have violated the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that protects individuals against rogue online pharmacies. Canada is home to dozens of licensed Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers (who must otherwise pay one of the world's highest drug prices).London Free Press Regional News Archive, Canada Internet Pharmacy Merged In $3.8 Million Deal In recent years, many consumers in the US (and in other countries with high drug costs), have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel, and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada. In the United States, there has been a push to legalize the importation of medications from Canada and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and federal laws, enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers. There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities. =Veterinary pharmacy= Veterinary pharmacies, sometimes called animal pharmacies, may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals. Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on veterinary medicine, are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be kept separate from regular pharmacies. =Nuclear pharmacy= Nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients. =Military pharmacy= Airman 1st Class Breanna DeMasters and Staff Sgt. Giovanni Fiorito, 332nd Expeditionary Medical Group pharmacy technicians, fill prescription medication for patients, Oct. 7, Joint Base Balad Iraq. Military pharmacy is a different working environment to civilian practise due to the fact that military pharmacy technicians perform duties such as evaluating medication orders, preparing medication orders, and dispensing medications. This would be illegal in civilian pharmacies because these duties are required to be performed by a licensed registered pharmacist. In the US military, state laws that prevent technicians from counseling patients or doing the final medication check prior to dispensing to patients (rather than a pharmacist solely responsible for these duties) do not apply. =Pharmacy informatics= Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science. Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies. As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment, and optimization. =Specialty pharmacy= Specialty pharmacies supply high-cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.NBCH Action Brief: Specialty Pharmacy. Specialty Pharmacy December 2013. Accessed 27 October 2014. Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed.Wild, D. Specialty Pharmacy Continuum Carving a Specialty Niche Within the ACO Model. Volume 1 (Summer Issue). August 2012. In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs. In the US, it is currently the fastest-growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs. Due to the demand for clinicians who can properly manage these specific patient populations, the Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board has developed a new certification exam to certify specialty pharmacists. Along with the 100 questions computerized multiple-choice exam, pharmacists must also complete 3,000 hours of specialty pharmacy practice within the past three years as well as 30 hours of specialty pharmacist continuing education within the past two years. Pharmaceutical sciences The pharmaceutical sciences are a group of interdisciplinary areas of study concerned with the design, action, delivery, and disposition of drugs. They apply knowledge from chemistry (inorganic, physical, biochemical and analytical), biology (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology), epidemiology, statistics, chemometrics, mathematics, physics, and chemical engineering. The pharmaceutical sciences are further subdivided into several specific specialties, with four main branches: *Pharmacology: the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on human beings. **Pharmacodynamics: the study of the cellular and molecular interactions of drugs with their receptors. Simply \\"What the drug does to the body\\" **Pharmacokinetics: the study of the factors that control the concentration of drug at various sites in the body. Simply \\"What the body does to the drug\\" **Pharmaceutical toxicology: the study of the harmful or toxic effects of drugs. **Pharmacogenomics: the study of the inheritance of characteristic patterns of interaction between drugs and organisms.Ermak, Gennady (2015). Emerging Medical Technologies. World Scientific. *Pharmaceutical chemistry: the study of drug design to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and synthesis of new drug molecules (Medicinal Chemistry). *Pharmaceutics: the study and design of drug formulation for optimum delivery, stability, pharmacokinetics, and patient acceptance.Rhodes, edited by Gilbert S. Banker, Christopher T. (2002). Modern Pharmaceutics, 1 (5th ed.). Hoboken: Informa Healthcare. *Pharmacognosy: the study of medicines derived from natural sources.American Society of Pharmacognosy As new discoveries advance and extend the pharmaceutical sciences, subspecialties continue to be added to this list. Importantly, as knowledge advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of pharmaceutical research and drug therapy. Pharmacocybernetics (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the pharmaceutical care of patients. Society and culture =Etymology= The word pharmacy is derived from Old French farmacie \\"substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect\\" from Medieval Latin pharmacia from Greek pharmakeia () \\"a medicine\\", which itself derives from pharmakon (), meaning \\"drug, poison, spell\\". (which is etymologically related to pharmakos). =Separation of prescribing and dispensing= Separation of prescribing and dispensing, also called dispensing separation, is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs. In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces conflict of interest in the healthcare industry, unnecessary health care, and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances. =The future of pharmacy= Pharmacists now go on rounds with doctors and have more patient interaction. In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills.American College of Clinical Pharmacy, Evidence of the Economic Benefit of Clinical Pharmacy Services: 1996‚Äì2000 In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.American Pharmacy Student Alliance (APSA) This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy.American College of Clinical Pharmacy, Clinical Pharmacy Defined Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \\"senior care pharmacy\\".American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, What is a Senior Care Pharmacist? In addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows \\"pharmacy based interventions improved patients' medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians' initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group\\".  Pharmacy journals  * List of Pharmacy Journals Symbols The symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy are the mortar and pestle (North America) and the ‚Ñû (Medical prescription) character, which is often written as \\"Rx\\" in typed text; the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India; the Bowl of Hygieia (only) often used in the Netherlands but may be seen combined with other symbols elsewhere.

Sun Yat-sen introduced the style shortly after the founding of the Republic of China as a form of national dress with distinct political overtones. He based the suit on the Japanese cadet uniform. The four pockets are said to represent the Four Virtues of propriety, justice, honesty, and shame; and the five buttons the branches of China's government (Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, Control). After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, such suits came to be worn widely by male citizens and government leaders as a symbol of proletarian unity and an Eastern counterpart to the Western business suit. The name \\"Mao suit\\" comes from Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong's fondness for the style, so that the garment became closely associated with him and with Chinese Communism. Mao's cut of the suit was influenced by the Stalin tunic then prevalent among Soviet officials. Although it fell into disuse among the general public in the 1990s due to increasing Western influences, it is still commonly worn by Chinese leaders during important state ceremonies and functions. In the 1960s and 1970s the Mao suit became fashionable among Western European, Australian, and New Zealand socialists and intellectuals. It was sometimes worn over a turtleneck.  Origins  When the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on Manchu dress (qipao and changshan), which had been imposed by the Qing Dynasty as a form of social control. The majority-Han Chinese revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to the West. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the Western hat to form a new dress. The Zhongshan suit is a similar development which combined Western and Eastern fashions. Historical development Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong both wearing Zhongshan suits, in Chongqing 1945 The Mao suit remained the standard formal dress for the first and second generations of PRC leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. During the 1990s, it began to be worn with decreasing frequency by leaders of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's generation as more and more Chinese politicians began wearing traditional Western-style suits with neckties. Jiang wore it only on special occasions, such as to state dinners. Hu Jintao still wore the Mao suit, but only on special occasions, such as the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic in 2009.\\"Mao suit continued choice of China's top leaders for National Day ceremony\\", Xinhua, 1 October 2009. Hu Jintao even showed up to a black tie state dinner in the United States wearing a business suit, attracting some criticism for being underdressed at a formal occasion. In the Xi Jinping administration, however, the Mao suit made a comeback as a diplomatic uniform and evening dress. Symbol of national sovereignty The Mao suit is worn at the most formal ceremonies as a symbol of national sovereignty. Chinese paramount leaders always wear Mao suits for military parades in Beijing, even though the Vice President and other Politburo officials wear Western business suits. It is customary for Chinese leaders to wear Mao suits when attending state dinners. In this situation, the Mao suit serves as a form of evening dress, equivalent to a military uniform for a monarch, or a tuxedo for a president. The Mao suit also serves as a diplomatic uniform. Although Chinese ambassadors usually wear Western business suits, many Chinese ambassadors choose to wear a Mao suit when they present their credentials to the head of state. The presentation ceremony is symbolic of the diplomatic recognition that exists between the two countries, so it carries a higher level of formality than other diplomatic meetings.

He served as Prime Minister from 1924 to 1926 and again from 1929 until his death in 1942. Under Stauning's leadership Denmark, like the other Western European countries, developed a social welfare state, and though many of his ambitions for Social Democracy were ultimately thwarted, in his lifetime, by events beyond his control, his leadership through grave times places Stauning among the most admired of twentieth-century Danish statesmen. The Stauning Alps, a large mountain range in Greenland, were named after him. Biography Stauning was trained as a cigar sorter and soon became involved with trade union activity. From 1896 to 1908 he was leader of the Cigar Sorters' Union (part of the Danish Tobacco Workers' Union, in 1898 ‚Äì 1904 also editor of the magazine Samarbejdet (Co-operation) of the Federation of Trade Unions, and elected Member of Parliament (Folketinget) in 1906. In 1910 he was elected chairman of the Social Democratic Party (Socialdemokratiet), a position he retained for almost thirty years, until 1939. After participating as Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet of Zahle II from 1916 to 1920, he returned to government as prime minister in 1924 for the minority cabinet Cabinet of Thorvald Stauning I which would survive until 1926. His cabinet was considered ground-breaking not only as it was the first purely Social Democratic cabinet, but also because a woman, Nina Bang, was appointed Minister of Education, which attracted some international attention, as she was one of the first female ministers in the world.Skou, Kaare R. (2005). Dansk politik A-√Ö . Aschehoug, pp. 110, 638-639. . From 1929 he led the successful coalition cabinet Cabinet of Thorvald Stauning II with the social liberal Det Radikale Venstre party that would steer Denmark out of the Great Depression, shaping a major political compromise that greatly improved the Danish economy, and also transformed the Social Democratic Party from a class party to a popular party. Under Stauning's leadership Denmark, like the other Western European countries, developed a social welfare state. It's often proposed that the long-lived coalition cabinet actively averted the communist and fascist movements that were sweeping much of Europe from developing a strong following in Denmark. In January 1933, Stauning's government entered into what was then the most extensive settlement yet in Danish politics‚Äîthe Kanslergade settlement ()‚Äîwith the liberal party Venstre.Skou, p. 367 The settlement, which was named after Stauning's apartment in Kanslergade in Copenhagen, included extensive agricultural subsidies and reforms of the legislation and administration in the social sector.M√∏rch, S√∏ren (2002). 24 statsministre . Copenhagen: Gyldendal, p. 165. . Stauning addresses the Rigsdagen in Christiansborg Palace on 9 April 1940 Stauning holds a record in Danish politics, in having successfully sought re-election no less than three times (1932, 1935 (With the famous slogan \\"Stauning or Chaos\\"), 1939). However, an attempt to amend the Constitution failed in 1939, as the turnout in the referendum was insufficient to validate the result. This came as a tremendous blow to Stauning, who seemed to lose his previously sure touch for politics thereafter. He reportedly considered resigning in the wake of the referendum failure, but was persuaded to stay on.Kaarsted, Tage (1977). De danske ministerier 1929-1953 . Copenhagen: Nyt Nordisk Forlag, Arnold Busck, p. 94. . Stauning's second cabinet lasted until Operation Weser√ºbung, the Nazi occupation of Denmark began on 9 April 1940, when the cabinet was widened to include all political parties, called the Cabinet of Thorvald Stauning III. Contrary to most other governments of the Nazi-invaded countries, King Christian X of Denmark and his government ordered the army and navy to stop fighting, and chose to remain in their country also under the occupation, which is believed to have contributed to the Nazi leaders being more lenient in Denmark than in other countries under Hitler's control. Stauning died in 1942, deeply depressed about the future of social democracy in a Nazi- dominated Europe. Legacy Like many other workers' leaders of his generation, such as Hjalmar Branting in Sweden, Stauning was a charismatic leader who played an important role in integrating Danish society after the social changes following the Industrial Revolution and common suffrage. His campaign slogan, \\"Stauning or Chaos,\\" () resonated in a nation undergoing a period of massive unemployment caused by the economic, social and political turmoil of its neighbors and trading partners, notably Denmark's chief trading partner Germany. The following Great Depression brought Danish unemployment to unprecedented heights. This period of widespread social malaise was fertile ground for leaders who could communicate a confident and coherent vision to the masses. Stauning was such a man for Denmark, and his popularity won the Social Democratic Party 46% of the total votes in the 1935 Folketing election, a figure never again reached by any Danish party. He was given a state funeral in 1942, an honour normally not bestowed on Danish prime ministers. Although Denmark's relationship with Germany during World War II has been controversial, Stauning's legacy in Denmark remains positive. His popularity in the 1930s acted as a force limiting the growth of other populist parties‚Äîmost importantly, the Nazi party, which remained politically insignificant. Stauning also played a major role in containing the constitutional Easter Crisis of 1920 where he brokered a deal with the king in which the monarch accepted a reduction of his own role to a merely symbolical one, avoiding any future interference in the functioning of parliamentary democracy. In return, Stauning kept the pro-republican elements of the Social Democratic Party in line, and ensured his party's political support to the continuation of the Danish monarchy. His government was also responsible for laying the foundations to the future Danish welfare state.

Since 2014 the provincial capital is Buluan but the legislative branch of the provincial government, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, convenes in the old provincial capitol in the town of Sultan Kudarat. It borders Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, Sultan Kudarat to the south, and the Illana Bay to the west. History =Precolonial and Spanish eras= The Sultanate of Maguindanao at its greatest extent in the 17th century. Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan of Johore introduced Islam in the area at the end of the 15th century. He subsequently married a local princess from the Maranao Tribe of Malabang and Maguindanao Province, and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao. The Cotabato Valley formed the sultanate's heartland but its influence extended from the Zamboanga Peninsula to Sarangani Bay and Davao. The Spaniards launched expeditions to subdue the area throughout the colonial era but they never gained control of the region until the middle of the 19th century after the Spaniards established a military post at what is now Barangay Tamontaka, one of the earliest Christian settlements founded south of the Philippines, in present- day Cotabato City. =American Era and World War II= The historical province of Cotabato covered the present area of Maguindanao. In 1903, the American colonial government established the Moro Province and made Cotabato as one of its districts. Upon the conversion of the Moro Province into the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914, the districts were made into provinces. In 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces entered what is now Maguindanao. In 1945, Maguindanao was liberated by allied Philippine Commonwealth troops and Maguindanaoan guerrilla units after defeating the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Maguindanao during the Second World War. =Creation as a province= The territory of the old province of Cotabato was reduced in 1966 when several of its municipalities were separated from it and constituted into the newly created province of South Cotabato. In 1973, Cotabato was dissolved when it was split to create three new provinces: Maguindanao, (North) Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat. Maguindanao is the only Muslim-majority province of the four created out of the original Cotabato Province. In 1989, majority of its voters opted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao but Cotabato City did not, which, ironically, has since served as the provisional capital of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and hosted line agency offices for the province. =Shariff Kabunsuan creation and nullification= On October 31, 2006, Maguindanao voters approved the creation of a new province to be composed of 10 towns from the province. Of more than 500,000 voters registered, 285,372 favored the creation of the province, and 8,802 voted against it. The new province, Shariff Kabunsuan, established through Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201 by the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly, became the country's 80th province and the 6th in the ARMM. It was composed of the towns of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Kabuntalan, Upi, Sultan Kudarat, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Sultan Mastura, Parang, Buldon, Matanog and Barira. However, in July 2008, the Supreme Court, in an 8‚Äì6 vote, nullified the province's creation, restoring its municipalities to Maguindanao, ruling that \\"Only Congress can create provinces and cities because the creation of provinces and cities necessarily includes the creation of legislative districts\\". =2009 election violence= guerillas in 1999 On November 23, 2009, a 2010 gubernatorial election caravan supporting Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan, was attacked. Fifty-seven people were killed, including Mangudadatu's wife and sisters, supporters, local journalists, and bystanders. On December 4, 2009, a number of homes belonging to the Ampatuan political family were raided in connection with the massacre. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo officially declared martial law in the province of Maguindanao on December 5, 2009, Saturday morning. In a press conference past 7 am, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita announced Proclamation No. 1959 declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the province of Maguindanao, except for certain areas identified as bailiwicks of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) separatists. The declaration of martial law led to the \\"arrests without warrants\\" of other members of the Ampatuan clan who have been linked to the November 23 massacre of 58 civilians. The 44 police officers who perished during the clash On August 15, 2011, Mangudadatu and his convoy were ambushed as they were on their way to his birthday celebration. =Mamasapano clash= On January 25, 2015, 44 members of the Special Action Force were killed after they killed the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir aka Marwan, by allegedly Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Mamasapano, Maguindanao. =2016 El Ni√±o= On February 2016, Maguindanao experienced the effects of the 2014‚Äì16 El Ni√±o, causing destruction on rice and corn fields due to drought. The province declared a state of calamity in response to the damages caused. Geography upright=0.85 Maguindanao is situated in the central section of Mindanao, bordered by Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, Sultan Kudarat to the south, and the Illana Bay to the west. =Administrative divisions= Maguindanao comprises 36 municipalities, further subdivided into 508 barangays. Cotabato City, although geographically grouped with Maguindanao, is administratively independent from the province. The province is divided into two congressional districts. In October 2006, the first congressional district was split off into a new province, Shariff Kabunsuan. However, the ARMM's Act creating the province was nullified by the Supreme Court in July 2008, on the basis that creation of a province is a function of the Philippine legislature. The area has since reverted to the province of Maguindanao. { class=\\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  City municipality ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  District ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=3  Population ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" colspan=2  Density ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-bottom:none;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Coordinates - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\" colspan=2  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden hidden solid solid;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-style:hidden solid solid hidden;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-top:none;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background- color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Ampatuan  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   17,800     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  11  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Barira  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1st   19,686     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  14  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Buldon  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1st   33,729     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  15  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -style=\\"background-color:#CCFFCC;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:#CCFFCC;border-right:0;\\"  Buluan  style=\\"text-align:right;border-left:0;\\"  ‚Ä†  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2nd   38,106     style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  7  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -style=\\"background-color:#FFF1BF;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;border-right:0;\\"  Cotabato City  style=\\"text-align:right;border-left:0;\\"  ‚àó‚àó  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1st  ‚Äî  299,438  271,786     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  37  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Datu Abdullah Sangki  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   17,079     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  10  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Datu Anggal Midtimbang  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2nd   13,339     style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  7  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:left;background-color:initial;\\" colspan=2  Datu Blah T.

Then ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) secretary Dick Mali said such establishments would help in \\"decentralizing functions and resources\\" and provide the people \\"more efficient public service and governance from their public officials.\\" However, Benedicto Bacani of the Institute of Autonomy and Governance in the Notre Dame University said such acts are methods to prevent potential conflicts between political families by having their own local government units where they can have governmental positions. =Proposed provincial division= House Bill No. 5185 was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 2, 2017 by former Representative Bai Sandra Sema who is barred by law to run for another term in her current district in 2019. It seeks to establish a new province called Maguindanao North, consisting of 11 municipalities and 2 legislative districts, of which Datu Odin Sinsuat will be the designated capital. Her successor, Congressman Datu Roonie Sinsuat, Sr. recently filed a new bill seeking for the same division ‚Äì only this time, it shall be named Western Maguindanao. Demographics The population of Maguindanao in the was people. When Cotabato City is included for geographical purposes, the province's population is 1,473,371 people. The majority (64.5 percent) of the people in Maguindanao are Maguindanaoans. The Iranuns which dominate the northern towns of Parang, Barira, Buldon and Matanog make up the second largest group with 18.4 percent. The Tedurays, which are the lumads of the southwestern highlands of the province make up 8.4 percent of the entire population, while Hiligaynons and Cebuanos constitute the remaining significant groups in the province with each making up 3.2 percent of the population. The main native languages are Maguindanao and Iranun, while Tagalog has emerged as the primary language among younger generations and is the primary medium of education. Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Chavacano are also spoken by both Christians and Muslims, with the Chavacano dialect native to Cotabato City being called Cotabate√±o, which evolved from the Zamboangue√±o dialect. Teduray, also native to the province, is spoken in the municipalities of Upi, South Upi, and Datu Blah T. Sinsuat. English, the country's other official language is also spoken, while Arabic is taught in Islamic schools. =Religion= Maguindanao inhabitants are predominantly practitioners of Islam which comprises 82.99% of the population, majority of which are Sunnites. A minority are Christians (mostly Roman Catholics), who are mostly Cebuanos, Ilonggos and Chavacanos. Roman Catholics of Maguindanao fall under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kidapawan, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cotabato. Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) has several locales in Maguindanao. Government Maguindanao is divided into two congressional districts, which elect members to the House of Representatives. For the brief period that the province of Shariff Kabunsuan existed, Maguindanao became a lone-district province. Since the appointment of a new set of provincial officials for the reunified province of Maguindanao by the ARMM Governor in January 2009, the provincial government has reverted to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan district configuration from before Shariff Kabunsuan was created. Having elected to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Maguindanao also sends six representatives (three per SP district) to the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly that convenes in Cotabato City. =Provincial capital= When the province was established in 1973, the designated seat of government was the municipality of Maganoy. The first appointed governor, Simeon Datumanong, held office in Limpongo, a former barangay in Maganoy which is now part of the municipality of Datu Hoffer Ampatuan. Datumanong's successor Zacaria Candao, on the other hand, held office at P.C. Hill, the site of the former headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary in Cotabato City, an autonomous chartered city not under Maguindanao's provincial jurisdiction. In 1977 following the resignation of Candao, President Ferdinand Marcos moved the province's seat of government to the municipality of Sultan Kudarat (hometown of the newly-appointed governor Sanggacala Baraguir) by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1170. During his term Baraguir held office at the then-newly-constructed provincial capitol in that municipality's Barangay Simuay Crossing. The next governor, Sandiale Sambolawan, held office in his hometown of Maganoy following his election to the governorship in 1980. In an attempt to legitimize the restoration of Maganoy's status as the seat of provincial government, Batas Pambansa Blg. 211 was enacted in 1982, but with the explicit provision that the change will only take effect after a plebiscite affirms the transfer. A plebiscite was scheduled for December 18, 1982, but was never administered, thus making the municipality of Sultan Kudarat still capital of Maguindanao by law (de jure), but Maganoy being the capital in practice (de facto). Following the end of the Marcos Regime, the next two governors ‚Äì Zacaria Candao (1986‚Äì1992; 1995‚Äì2001) and Norodin Matalam (1992‚Äì1995) ‚Äì both held office in the existing capitol at Sultan Kudarat thereby restoring the municipality's status as both de jure and de facto provincial capital from 1986 to 2001. Despite the lack of legal justification in the form of a law amending P.D. No. 1170 of 1977 or the passage of a supporting Sangguaniang Panlalawigan (SP) resolution, the next governor, Andal Ampatuan Sr. (governor from 2001 to 2008), and his successor, son Sajid Ampatuan (2008‚Äì2009), held office in the Ampatuan clan stronghold of Shariff Aguak (renamed from Maganoy in 1996), citing security concerns connected to clan rivalry. A new 218-million provincial capitol complex, inaugurated in 2009 in the presence of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was located adjacent to the homes of the Ampatuans, and sat on a piece of Amaptuan clan land that had not been legally deeded to the government. The Ampatuans were even known to spend more time within the \\"satellite offices\\" they set up within their private properties, despite though the new capitol being located adjacent to their homes. Esmael Mangudadatu, who took office after defeating Andal Ampatuan Jr. in the 2010 gubernatorial election, cited security concerns when he decided to work from a \\"satellite office,\\" named the Rajah Buayan Silongan Peace Center, in his hometown of Buluan; this move was supported by Resolution No. 5, series 2010, of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) of Maguindanao. SP Resolution No. 78, dated May 3, 2011, further allowed the transfer of the legislative branch of the provincial government (Sangguniang Panlalawigan) to the rehabilitated old capitol site in Barangay Simuay Crossing, Sultan Kudarat. This effectively made both Buluan and Sultan Kudarat ‚Äì located 120 kilometers apart by road ‚Äì the seats of the executive and legislative branches of provincial government respectively. On April 3, 2012, the SP of Maguindanao issued Resolution No. 132, reiterating that the town of Sultan Kudarat was the capital of Maguindanao. However this was superseded by a new resolution passed in 2014 naming Buluan the new capital of Maguindanao. Buluan's Rajah Buayan Silongan Peace Center now serves as the provisional capitol building, pending the completion of the executive building in the new capitol complex. However, the legislative branch of provincial government, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Maguindanao, continues to hold sessions in the rehabilitated buildings of the old provincial capitol in Simuay, Sultan Kudarat. The Ampatuan-built former provincial capitol complex in Shariff Aguak, initially planned to be converted for public school use, has been planned to become the new headquarters of the ARMM's Bureau of Fire Protection and eventually became an infantry brigade of the Philippine Army. However, incumbent governor Bai Mariam Mangudadatu holds her office in the Shariff Aguak Provincial Capitol and plans to convert the Buluan provincial capitol as district hospital.

In the early stages of the war against the French colonial forces, the Viet Minh created an extensive underground system of tunnels, which was later expanded and improved by the Viet Cong. By the 1960s, the tunnel complexes included hospitals, training areas, storage facilities, headquarters, and barracks. These diverse facilities, coupled with sophisticated ventilation systems, allowed VC guerrillas to remain hidden underground for months at a time. During the Vietnam War, U.S. and ANZAC troops uncovered a great number of enemy tunnels while patrolling or conducting larger operations. The men of the 3 Field Force, an Australian combat engineering unit that served in Vietnam from 1965-1966, have made a convincing argument that they were the first allied troops to enter the tunnels. Tunnel rats were given the task of destroying them, gathering intelligence within them, and killing or capturing their occupants‚Äîoften in conditions of close combat. Typically, a tunnel rat was equipped with only a standard issue M1911 pistol or M1917 revolver,http://www.historic- firearms.com/m1917-revolver.html M1917 revolver a bayonet, a flashlight, and explosives. Many tunnel rats reportedly came to dislike the intense muzzle blast of the relatively large .45 caliber round, as the .45's loud report could often leave one temporarily deaf when fired in a confined space.http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2423 TUNNEL WEAPON: THE BANG IN THE DARK By Kevin Dockery.

A Viet Cong soldier crouches in a tunnel with an SKS rifle. Besides enemy combatants, the tunnels themselves presented many potential dangers to tunnel rats. Sometimes they were poorly constructed and they would simply collapse. Tunnels were often booby trapped with hand grenades, anti-personnel mines, and punji sticks. The VC would even use venomous snakes (placed as living booby traps). Rats, spiders, scorpions, and ants also posed threats to tunnel rats. Bats also roosted in the tunnels, although they were generally more of a nuisance than a threat. Tunnel construction occasionally included anti-intruder features such as U-bends that could be flooded quickly to trap and drown the tunnel rat. Sometimes poison gases were used. A tunnel rat might therefore choose to enter the tunnels wearing a gas mask (donning one within was frequently impossible in such a confined space). According to U.S. tunnel rat veterans, however, most tunnel rats usually went without gas masks because wearing one made it even harder to see, hear, and breathe in the narrow dark passages. Tunnel rats were generally men of smaller stature ( and under), who were able to maneuver more comfortably in the narrow tunnels. Tom Mangold and John Penycate, authors of one of the definitive accounts of tunnel warfare during the Vietnam War, reported that the U.S. tunnel rats were almost exclusively soldiers of European or Hispanic descent, many of whom were Puerto Rican or Mexican American. Video showing Cu Chi Tunnels complex By Mangold and Penycate's account, the contributions of tunnel rats first garnered public attention in January 1966, after a combined U.S. and Australian operation against the C·ªß Chi tunnels in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, known as Operation Crimp. The \\"Diehards\\" of the U.S. Army's 1st Engineer Battalion, whose exploits are featured in Mangold and Penycate's book, later claimed a special place for tunnel rats in American military history during their rotation through the Cu Chi District of Vietnam in 1969. In the years since the Vietnam War ended tunnel rats have suffered from a high percentage of Agent Orange injuries and diseases due to soldier's exposure to the chemicals on the ground, or that leeched from topsoil into the tunnel environment. While in the tunnels, soldiers were breathing air heavily saturated with Agent Orange. Afghanistan Afghanistan features an extensive series of historic tunnels used for transporting water and the \\"kariz.\\" During the 1979‚Äì1989 Soviet war in Afghanistan, such tunnels were used by Mujahideen fighters. The Soviet 40th Army therefore fielded their own tunnel clearance and demolition units, which were given the task of clearing the tunnels of enemy combatants, disarming booby traps, and destroying the underground complexes.

He has collaborated with artists such as Dillon and Glenn Fabry on Preacher, John McCrea on Hitman, Marc Silvestri on The Darkness, and Carlos Ezquerra on both Preacher and Hitman. Career Ennis began his comic-writing career in 1989 with the series Troubled Souls. Appearing in the short-lived but critically acclaimed British anthology Crisis and illustrated by John McCrea, it told the story of a young, apolitical Protestant man caught up by fate in the violence of the Irish 'Troubles'. It spawned a sequel, For a Few Troubles More, a broad Belfast-based comedy featuring two supporting characters from Troubled Souls, Dougie and Ivor, who later got their own American comics series, Dicks, from Caliber in 1997, and several follow-ups from Avatar. Ennis was later critical of his writing debut, which he describes as \\"the kind of thing that was doing well at the time. (...) With hindsight, what Troubled Souls really represented was naked ambition. It was a direct attempt to get published. And that was the road that seemed most likely to lead me to success\\".Preacher to the converted, The Irish Times, 27 August 2011 Another series for Crisis was True Faith, a religious satire inspired by his schooldays, this time drawn by Warren Pleece. Like the two Troubles stories it was collected as a graphic novel in 1990, but religious protests led to it being quickly withdrawn from sale, apparently on the orders of publisher Robert Maxwell. It was later republished in 1997 by Vertigo. Ennis shortly after began to write for Crisis' parent publication, 2000 AD. He quickly graduated on to the title's flagship character, Judge Dredd, taking over from original creator John Wagner for a period of several years. Ennis's most notable Dredd stories include Muzak Killer (a pastiche of mainstream pop music), Emerald Isle (a tongue-in-cheek story set in Ennis's native Ireland), and the twenty-part epic Judgment Day. Ennis also contributed the surreal Time Flies (with artist Philip Bond), dealing with time-travel paradoxes and Nazis. Ennis' first work on an American comic came in 1991 when he took over DC Comics's horror title Hellblazer, which he wrote until 1994. Steve Dillon became the regular artist during the second half of Ennis's run. The creative partnership established went on to create Preacher. From 1993 to 1995 Ennis and John McCrea worked on another DC title, The Demon, during which they introduced super-powered contract killer Tommy Monaghan, also known as Hitman, whose own series allowed their creative partnership to continue when The Demon ended. Towards the end of the initial Hellblazer run, Ennis and Dillon collaborated on a one-shot called Heartland, exploring one of the secondary characters of their run. Several years after leaving, Ennis briefly returned for the five-part Son of Man story with artist John Higgins. Ennis' landmark work to date is the 66-issue epic Preacher, which he co-created with artist Steve Dillon. Running from 1995 to 2000, it was a tale of a preacher with supernatural powers, searching (literally) for God who has abandoned his creation. Mixing influences from western movies and religious themes, it drew plaudits for Ennis from all sections of the media; the Guardian newspaper voted one of the Preacher collections its book of the week, and film director Kevin Smith described it as \\"More fun than going to the movies.\\" While Preacher was running, Ennis began a series set in the DC universe called Hitman. Despite being lower profile than Preacher, Hitman ran for 60 issues (plus specials) from 1996 to 2001, veering wildly from violent action to humor to an examination of male friendship under fire. Other comic projects Ennis wrote during this time period include Goddess, Bloody Mary, Unknown Soldier, and Pride & Joy, all for DC/Vertigo, as well as origin stories for The Darkness for Image Comics and Shadowman for Valiant Comics. His work has won him recognition in the comics industry, including nominations for the Comics Buyer's Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Ennis is also known for his disdain for superhero stories and characters, a genre that had dominated the American comic book industry for decades. He prefers more \\"grounded\\" characters such as the Punisher, John Constantine, or Nick Fury. An avid reader of British war comics during his formative years, Ennis did not read superhero comics until his late teens, at which point he found them ridiculous. He has stated : \\"I find most superhero stories completely meaningless. Which is not to say I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs potential for the genre ‚Äì Alan Moore and Warren Ellis have both done interesting work with the notion of what it might be like to be and think beyond human, see Miracleman, Watchmen and Supergod. But so long as the industry is geared towards fulfilling audience demand ‚Äì ie, for the same brightly coloured characters doing the same thing forever ‚Äì you‚Äôre never going to see any real growth. The stories can‚Äôt end, so they‚Äôll never mean anything.\\"Why Garth Ennis hates superheroes and loves war, scifinow.co.uk, 24 July 2012 As a World War II aficionado, he finds characters like Captain America \\"borderline offensive, because to me the reality of World War II was very human people, ordinary flesh-and-blood guys who slogged it out in miserable, flooded foxholes. So adding some fantasy superhero narrative, that has always annoyed me a little bit.\\" Although he has written a number of superhero stories, Ennis has tried to \\"subvert\\" the genre as well as he could. He does, however, like Superman and Wonder Woman.Drinking With the Boys: An Evening with Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon, sequentialtart.com, 27 September 27, 1998 In the 1995 one-shot special Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe, Ennis has the Punisher kill every single superhero and supervillain on Earth. After the end of Hitman, Ennis was hired at Marvel Comics with the promise from Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada that he could write The Punisher as long as he cared to. The initial 12-issue maxi- series was illustrated by Steve Dillon, who also did a 37-issue series (even illustrating it and co-writing an issue while Ennis briefly stepped down as writer) which only ended when Ennis decided to change direction. Instead of largely comical tone of these issues, he decided to make a much more serious series, re-launched under Marvel's MAX imprint. This run has inspired several limited series (such as Born and Barracuda) and one-shots (The End, The Cell, and The Tyger). The creators of Punisher: War Zone have attributed Ennis's The Punisher MAX run as one of the major influences on the film.Wizard.

In 2001 he briefly returned to UK comics to write the epic Helter Skelter for Judge Dredd ‚Äì this series cannot be considered a success, with Ennis himself saying that there is \\"not a hope\\" to return to writing Dredd as he was generally not happy with his run. \\"I'm too close to Dredd, I like him too much. I can't tamper with the formula; nor can I take the piss the way I do with superheroes,\\" he said.Will Cooling, Caught in the Nexus: Garth Ennis, 16 August 2004 Other comics Ennis has written include War Story (with various artists) for DC; The Pro for Image Comics; The Authority for Wildstorm; Just a Pilgrim for Black Bull Press, and 303, Chronicles of Wormwood (a six issue mini-series about the Antichrist), and a western comic book, Streets of Glory for Avatar Press.Interview with Ennis about Streets of Glory , Comics Bulletin Ennis signing copies of Hitman and Preacher at a 19 April 2012 appearance at Midtown Comics Downtown in Manhattan In 2002, an interview with Ennis was published in Writers on Comic Scriptwriting. In 2006, it was announced that Ennis would write a new creator-owned extended series titled The Boys, originally published by Wildstorm. After six issues, The Boys was cancelled by Wildstorm. Ennis later explained that this was because DC Comics (of whom Wildstorm was an imprint before it was disbanded) were uneasy with the anti- superhero tone of the work. The series was picked up by Dynamite Entertainment. The Boys was illustrated by Darick Robertson, who previously worked with Ennis on the Marvel series Fury: Peacemaker and Punisher: Born. The Boys ran for 72 issues, and concluded in 2012. Ennis wrote the first arc of WildStorm's Midnighter (a spin-off of The Authority) and one stand-alone issue before leaving the title.

To the southwest lies Illana Bay, an arm of the Moro Gulf. Situated in the interior of Lanao del Sur is Lanao Lake, the largest in Mindanao. The Darangen Epic Chants of the Maranao of Lanao del Sur is inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage since 2008. The town of Tugaya is also recognized as a UNESCO Home for Culture and Heritage. The Craftsmanship of the people of Tugaya was formally requested by UNESCO to be included in the UNESCO Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2014 once proper documentation from the Philippine government has been completed. Furthermore, scholars have been pushing for the inclusion of the Torogans of Lanao in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

During this era, various cultural icons developed, such as the torogan, the singkil dance, the darangen epic, the unique Maranao gong and metal craft culture, the sarimanok, the okir motif, and an indigenous suyat script.http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural- communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/central-cultural-communities/the- history-of-the-muslim-in-the- philippines/http://www.choosephilippines.com/go/history-and- culture/5772/wildflower-maja-salvador-singkil-lanao-del-sur =Sultanate of Lanao= Lanao was first explored by the Spaniards in 1689, upon which they discovered a well-settled community named Dansalan at the lake's northern end. Lanao was the seat of the Sultanate of Lanao. During the Pre-Spanish time, there are 4 important boundaries hold the power of appointing a new sultan namely: Bakayawan, Dalama, Madamba and Sawer. In appointing a new sultan the permission of these four boundaries are needed to validate the new sultan appointed to his position. =World War II= In 1942, it was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Forces who landed in Southern Lanao. On May 2, 1942, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Jos√© Abad Santos was killed by the Japanese Imperial forces in a firing squad at Malabang, Lanao del Sur. In 1945, the first of the liberation forces landed in Southern Lanao and liberated the area with United States, Philippine Commonwealth troops together with the Maranao guerrilla units. They used infantry weapons, the Maranao Kris, Barong and Kampilan swords against the Japanese forces in the Battle of Lanao. In 1956, Republic Act No. 1552 changed the name Dansalan to Marawi, taken from the word rawi, referring to the reclining lilies abundant in the Agus River. Lanao province map in 1918 =Division= In 1959, Lanao was divided into two provinces, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur, under Republic Act No. 2228. Marawi was designated as the capital of Lanao del Sur. The city was renamed the \\"Islamic City of Marawi\\" in 1980, and is currently the Philippines' only city having a predominantly Muslim population. =Proposed Maranaw province= In 1971, Republic Act No. 6406, which sought to create a new province out of eastern Lanao del Sur (now corresponding to the province's first congressional district), was approved on October 4, 1971. The province was to consist of the municipalities of Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain (including what is now Buadiposo-Buntong), Kapai, Lumba-Bayabao (including what is now Maguing), Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Tamparan, Taraka and Wao (including what is now Bumbaran), with the chartered city of Marawi serving as the new provincial capital. The division never took place due to the declaration of Martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, which disrupted the elections for 1973. = Inclusion to the ARMM = In a 1989 plebiscite, Lanao del Sur voted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), but the city of Marawi voted to remain outside the ARMM. It later joined ARMM in 2001 following the plebiscite that sought to expand the autonomous region. = Contemporary history = The Battle of Marawi began and ended in 2017. The battle was against ISIL- affiliated militants, a number of which were Malaysian citizens. The battle destroyed most of the cityscape of Marawi and killed hundreds of civilians and Filipino soldiers. A petition was released in support for the usage of the torogan as inspiration for the rehabilation of Marawi after the Battle of Marawi. The petition was released in opposition to the possible Manila Rehabilation Effect that the government plans to impose. The Manila-style rehabilation would establish shanty shouses and buildings without Maranao architectural styles, thus destroying Marawi's Maranao cultural skyline. The petition advocates a Warsaw-style Rehabilation Effect, where the culture and styles of a particular area is used as foundation for rehabilitation of built heritage and landscape. Among the local architectural styles that may be used under the Warsaw-style are the okir, sarimanok, and inspirations from the torogan. The Warsaw-style is also foreseen to boost tourism in the city in the long-run due to the cultural aesthetics it would bring. Governors after People Power Revolution Geography Satellite view of Lanao Lake, situated entirely within the province Lanao del Sur forms the western portion of Northern Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by Lanao del Norte, on the east by Bukidnon, on the west by Illana Bay, and on the south by Maguindanao and Cotabato. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills and valleys, placid lakes and rivers. Located within the province is Lanao Lake, the second largest in the country, its waters drained by the Agus River which eventually empties into the Iligan Bay. The climate in the province is characterized by even distribution of rainfall throughout the year, without a distinct summer season. The province is located outside the typhoon belt. =Administrative divisions= Lanao del Sur comprises 39 municipalities and 1 city. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text- align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" - !

The element was earlier inscribed in the UNESCO Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Representative List in 2005. The organization has also designated the Old Town of Tugaya as a UNESCO Home for Culture and Heritage. UNESCO has recommended for the nomination of Tugaya and all of Lanao del Sur's traditional crafts heritage in Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, following reports made in 2014 and 2015. The Philippine ambassador to UNESCO and France noted that it will be better to inscribe Maranao's traditional crafts in the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as they have been endangered due to the 2017 Battle of Marawi. The nomination is being finalized by the Philippine government, as announced in 2018. The torogans of Lanao are also recommended by UNESCO to be nominated in the World Heritage List once proper documentation and restoration has been completed. Two torogans have been bought by a controversial heritage resort company, Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar, and were transported to Bataan, sparking a provincial campaign to get back the two royal houses to their ancestral homeland.https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/105391/art-installations-inaugurate- art-space-at-controversial-acuzar-heritage-resort-in-bataan/ Hospitals * Amai Pakpak Medical Center * Former Libyan Hospital * Dr. Abdullah Hospital References External links  Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Provinces of the Philippines Bangsamoro States and territories established in 1959 1959 establishments in the Philippines ","title":"Lanao del Sur"},{"id":"297372","title":"Arthur Rubinstein"},{"id":"297373","text":"US soldiers search Vietnamese homes for Viet Cong guerrillas. Search and Destroy, Seek and Destroy, or even simply S&D;, refers to a military strategy that became a large component of the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. The idea was to insert ground forces into hostile territory, search out the enemy, destroy them, and withdraw immediately afterward. The strategy was the result of a new technology, the helicopter, which resulted in a new form of warfare, the fielding of air cavalry,Starry, p. 221 and was thought to be ideally suited to counter-guerrilla jungle warfare. The complementary conventional strategy, which entailed attacking and conquering an enemy position, then fortifying and holding it indefinitely, was known as \\"clear and hold\\" or \\"clear and secure.\\" In theory, since the traditional methods of \\"taking ground\\" could not be used in this war, a war of attrition would be used, eliminating the enemy by the use of \\"searching\\" for them, then \\"destroying\\" them, and the \\"body count\\" would be the measuring tool to determine the success of the strategy of \\"search and destroy.\\" Malaysia The British conducted search and destroy operations in effort to flush out communist insurgents in the jungles during the early years of the Malayan Emergency. The Ferret Force, which was formed in 1948, became an important intelligence provider to the British military. The objective was to contact with native locals and intelligence as to the whereabouts of communist insurgents. With the information the captured persons provided, British troops would use search and destroy as a tactic in effort to flush out the insurgents. Once the communist guerrillas had been flushed out by search and destroy missions, they would be harried by denial of food and medical supplies, perhaps by surrendered enemy personnel willing to cooperate with the British, and eventually induced to surrender, tempted into betrayal, or killed off by a precise military strike, usually an ambush. In the end, many British officials suspected that the search and destroy worked out poorly because the way it was conducted was in a brutalized way. British troops often set fire to villages accused of supporting the insurgents, detaining thousands of suspected collaborators, and in order to deny the insurgents cover. British units that discovered civilians providing assistance to insurgents were to detain and interrogate them to discover the location of insurgent camps. Insurgents had numerous advantages over British forces; they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, forcing them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual threat: the insurgents and the silent network in villages who, willingly or unwillingly, supported them. While the insurgents rarely sought out contact with British forces, they used terrorist tactics to intimidate civilians and elicit material support. British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols; in addition to watching out for insurgent fighters, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the enemy and then, without warning, insurgents would ambush them. British forces, unable to distinguish from friend to foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. Such instances led to the infamous incident at Batang Kali in which 24 unarmed villagers were killed by British troops.The Other Forgotten War: Understanding atrocities during the Malayan Emergency Vietnam Search and destroy became an offensive tool that was crucial to General William Westmoreland's second phase during the Vietnam War. In his three-phase strategy, the first was to tie down the Viet Cong, the second phase was to resume the offensive and destroy the enemy, and the third phase was to restore the area under South Vietnamese government control. Most Zippo missions were assigned to the second phase around 1966 and 1967, along with clear-and-secure operations. Search- and-destroy missions entailed sending out platoons, companies, or larger detachments of US troops from a fortified position to locate and destroy communist units in the countryside. These missions most commonly involved hiking out into the \\"boonies\\" and setting an ambush in the brush, near a suspected Viet Cong trail. The ambush typically involved the use of fixed Claymore antipersonnel mines, crossing lines of small arms fire, mortar support, and possibly additional artillery support called in via radio from a nearby fire support base. In February 1967, some of the largest Zippo missions were conducted in the Iron Triangle, between Saigon and Routes 13 and 25. The area had a mass centre of Viet Cong logistics and headquarters, with some of the most high-ranking NLF officials stationed there. The offensive began with Operation Junction City, where the American units assigned had destroyed hundreds of tons of rice, killed 720 guerrillas, and captured 213 prisoners. However, the number of defenders in the Iron Triangle area was thought to be over 10,000. The offensive failed to destroy the NLF's headquarters or to capture any high-ranking officers and so it had little effect toward Hanoi's plan. Both search-and-destroy and clear-and-hold missions stretched into the third phase, which began in 1968. The number of missions mounted, especially after the US was hit by General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p's Tet offensive in 1968. As the war grew more aggressive, so did the missions, and search-and-destroy and clear-and-secure operations became merged. Search-and-destroy missions had many flaws. First, there was lack of distinction between clearing and search- and-destroy missions. Thus, clearing missions, which were less aggressive, eventually morphed into a more violent and brutal form of tactic, just as search-and-destroy missions were. With the lack of distinction between, clearing, and search-and-destroy missions, pacification was not pushed. Guenter Lewy, a Professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, argued that the generals and war planners severely underestimated the enemy's abilities to match and even to exceed US forces.George C. Herring, American Strategy in Vietnam: The Postwar Debate. Large numbers of Viet Cong troops would be killed or captured, but they were quickly replaced. Enemy forces were initially pushed out of certain territories, but as soon as the American forces left the areas, they simply returned with more reinforcements and weapons. The effectiveness of the missions is also doubtful. In one of the first search-and-destroy missions northwest of D·∫ßu Ti·∫øng, named Operation Attleboro, a US report states that 115 U.S. soldiers were killed, and the North Vietnamese lost 1,062. In Operation Junction City, the report also states that 282 US soldiers were killed, and the Viet Cong lost 1,728 guerrillas. Those estimated figures, however, should be considered in light of the by how they were obtained. They were almost exclusively gathered by indirect means: sensor readings, sightings of secondary explosions, reports of defectors or prisoners-of-war, and inference or extrapolation.Dougan and Weiss, p. 55.

Early life Sources differ over Spann's early years. Some state that he was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1930, \\"Otis Spann\\". Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved 13 October 2016Dicaire, David (1999). Blues Singers: Biographies of 50 Legendary Artists of the Early 20th Century. McFarland. p. 119. but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc concluded, on the basis of census records and other official information, that he was born in 1924 in Belzoni, Mississippi. Spann's father was, according to some sources, a pianist called Friday Ford. His mother, Josephine Erby, was a guitarist who had worked with Memphis Minnie and Bessie Smith, and his stepfather, Frank Houston Spann, was a preacher and musician. One of five children, Spann began playing the piano at the age of seven, with some instruction from Friday Ford, Frank Spann, and Little Brother Montgomery.Harris, S. (1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. pp. 477‚Äì479. . Career By the age of 14, he was playing in bands in the Jackson area. He moved to Chicago in 1946, where he was mentored by Big Maceo Merriweather. Spann performed as a solo act and with the guitarist Morris Pejoe, working a regular spot at the Tic Toc Lounge. Spann became known for his distinctive piano style. He replaced Merriweather as Muddy Waters's piano player in late 1952 and participated in his first recording session with the band on September 24, 1953. He continued to record as a solo artist and session player with other musicians, including Bo Diddley and Howlin' Wolf, during his tenure with the group. He stayed with Muddy Waters until 1968. Spann's work for Chess Records includes the 1954 single \\"It Must Have Been the Devil\\" backed with \\"Five Spot\\", with B.B. King and Jody Williams on guitars. During his time at Chess he played on a few of Chuck Berry's early records, including the studio version of \\"You Can't Catch Me\\". In 1956, he recorded two unreleased tracks with Big Walter Horton and Robert Lockwood.Leadbitter, M.; Fancourt, L.; Pelletier, P. (1994). Blues Records 1943‚Äì1970, vol. 2. London: Record Information Services. He recorded a session with the guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. and vocalist St. Louis Jimmy in New York on August 23, 1960, which was issued on the albums Otis Spann Is the Blues and Walking the Blues. A 1963 session for Storyville Records was recorded in Copenhagen. He worked with Muddy Waters and Eric Clapton on recordings for DeccaRoberty, Marc (1993). Eric Clapton: The Complete Recording Sessions 1963‚Äì1995. New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press. p. 16. and with James Cotton for Prestige in 1964. The Blues Is Where It's At, Spann's 1966 album for ABC- Bluesway, includes contributions from George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith, Muddy Waters, and Sammy Lawhorn. The Bottom of the Blues (1967), featuring Spann's wife, Lucille Spann (June 23, 1938 - August 2, 1994), was released by Bluesway. He worked on albums with Buddy Guy, Big Mama Thornton, Peter Green, and Fleetwood Mac in the late 1960s. In 2012, Silk City Records released Someday which featured live and studio performances from 1967 produced by the noted blues guitarist Son Lewis. DVD recordings of Spann include his performances at the Newport Jazz Festival (1960), the American Folk Blues Festival (1963), the Blues Masters (1966), and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival (1968). Death Spann died of liver cancer in Chicago in 1970. He was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery, in Alsip, Illinois. His grave was unmarked for almost thirty years, until Steve Salter (president of the Killer Blues Headstone Project) wrote a letter to Blues Revue magazine, saying, \\"This piano great is lying in an unmarked grave. Let's do something about this deplorable situation\\". Blues enthusiasts from around the world sent donations to purchase a headstone. On June 6, 1999, the marker was unveiled in a private ceremony. The stone is inscribed, \\"Otis played the deepest blues we ever heard ‚Äì He'll play forever in our hearts\\". Legacy In 1972, the site of the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival was named \\"Otis Spann Memorial Field\\". That same year, Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called Spann \\"the greatest modern blues pianist\\". He later included Spann's 1972 Barnaby compilation Walking the Blues in \\"A Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s music, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). Spann was posthumously elected to the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980. On November 13, 2012, Spann (along with cousin and fellow pianist Little Johnnie Jones) received a Mississippi Blues Trail Marker plaque, erected at 547 South Roach Street in Jackson, Mississippi where the family lived in the 1930s and 1940s.

It is in the Sanma Province of Vanuatu. The town of Luganville, on Espiritu Santo's southeast coast, is Vanuatu's second-largest settlement and the provincial capital. Roads run north and west from Luganville, but most of the island is far from the limited road network. Around Espiritu Santo lie a number of small islands and islets; among them are: Dany Island, Araki, Elephant Island, Sakao, Lataroa, Lataro, Thion, Malohu, Malwepe, Malvapevu, Malparavu, Maltinerava, Oyster Island, Tangoa, and Bokissa. Vanuatu's highest peak is the 1879 metre (6165 foot) Mount Tabwemasana in west-central Espiritu Santo. In 1998, Espiritu Santo hosted the Melanesia Cup. History Champagne Beach, North Santo Local children A Spanish expedition of three ships, led by Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s, landed in 1606 at Big Bay on the north side of the island. Queir√≥s named the land La Estensen, M. (2006) Terra Australia Incognita; The Spanish Quest for the Great South Land. Allen & Unwin, Australia del Esp√≠ritu Santo in acknowledgment of the Spanish king's descent from the royal House of Austria, and believing he had arrived in the Great Southern Continent, Terra Australis. They entered the bay on the 1st and 2 May: the latter being the day of Saints Philip and James, Queir√≥s named it . pp. 299-300. The local chief tried to chase the Spanish explorers back to their ships, which led to an exchange of arrows and musket-fire, in which the chief was killed.Burney (1803), pp. 300‚Äì301. Burney is critical of the Spaniards' approach to diplomacy, though he notes the incident probably \\"saved the people of the country from the dominion of European masters\\". The ships remained for a month at their anchorage \\"\\", with armed sailors making incursions inland for provisions.Burney (1803) pp. 302‚Äì304. Queir√≥s announced his intention to found a city, Nova Jerusalem, and appointed municipal officers. In early June, with provisions running low, they left the bay to explore the neighbouring coastline. Queir√≥s' lead ship became separated, and, whether through adverse weather or mutiny, was unable to make anchor in the bay. The (second-in-command, and captain of the second ship), Luis V√°ez de Torres, searched the coast for signs of shipwreck but found none.Burney (1803), p. 305Diego del Prado: \\"Luis Baes de Torres went in the boat, well equipped, along the coast of the bay to the north and the launch along the other coast, hugging the land because if the vessel had made shipwreck they would find plenty of pieces of planks along the coast\\" (manuscript, English translation). He remained until late June, then sailed to the west coast with the intention of circumnavigating what he considered to be an island, not a continent. The wind and current were against this aim, so he left the island sailing west, eventually encountering the previously unexplored southern coast of New Guinea.Burney (1803) p. 311. Torres then discovered the strait that bears his name between northern Australia and southern New Guinea. After the departure of Queir√≥s and Torres, the Espiritu Santo was not visited again by Europeans until 160 years later, by Louis de Bougainville in 1768 and James Cook in 1774.Burney (1803), p. 299 During the time of the British‚ÄìFrench Condominium, Hog Harbour, on the northeast coast, was the site of the British district administration, while Segond, near Luganville, was the French district administration. ID check at the entrance to the base during World War II During World War II, particularly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the island was used by American naval and air forces as a military supply and support base, naval harbor, and airfield. In highly fictionalized form, this was the locale of James Michener's Tales of the South Pacific, and of the following Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, South Pacific. The presence of the Americans later contributed to the island's tourism in scuba diving, as the Americans dumped most of their used military and naval equipment, and their refuse, at what is now known as \\"Million Dollar Point\\". A shipwreck off Espiritu Santo, that of the SS President Coolidge, is also a popular diving spot. The SS President Coolidge was a converted luxury liner that hit a sea mine during the war and was sunk. Between May and August 1980 the island was the site of a rebellion during the transfer of power over the colonial New Hebrides from the condominium to the independent Vanuatu. Jimmy Stevens' Nagriamel movement, in alliance with private French interests and backed by the Phoenix Foundation and American libertarians hoping to establish a tax- free haven, declared the island of Espiritu Santo to be independent of the new government. The \\"Republic of Vemerana\\" was proclaimed on May 28. France recognized the independence on June 3. On June 5, the tribal chiefs of Santo named the French Ambassador Philippe Allonneau the \\"King of Vemerana\\", and Jimmy Stevens became the Prime Minister. Luganville was renamed Allonneaupolis. Next, negotiations with Port-Vila failed, and from July 27 to August 18, British Royal Marines and a unit of the French Garde Mobile were deployed to Vanuatu's capital island, but they did not enter Espiritu Santo as the soon-to-be government had hoped. The troops were recalled shortly before independence. Following independence, Vanuatu, now governed by Father Walter Lini, requested assistance from Papua New Guinea, whose army invaded and conquered Espiritu Santo, keeping it in Vanuatu. Culture Best Point, South Santo Espiritu Santo, with many wrecks and reefs to be explored, is a very popular tourist destination for divers. Champagne Beach draws tourists with its white sand and clear waters. The \\"Western Side\\" of the island contains many caves which can be explored, and cruise ships often stop in at Luganville. The local people make their living by supporting the tourist trade, by cash-crop farming, mostly copra, but also some cocoa beans and kava, as well as peanuts, or by subsistence farming and fishing. Most of the people are Christians. The largest church groups on the island are the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Church of Melanesia (Anglican). Also active are the Apostolic Church, the Church of Christ, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and others. However, in many villages, particularly in Big Bay and South Santo, the people are \\"heathen\\", a term that in Vanuatu has no pejorative connotation ‚Äî it simply denotes someone who has not embraced Christianity. Customary beliefs of a more modern sort are found among followers of the Nagriamel movement based in Fanafo. For almost all of Espiritu Santo's people, custom plays a large part in their lives, regardless of their religion. The chief system continues strongly in most areas. The people of Santo face some health problems, especially malaria and tuberculosis. Although there is a hospital, most local people consult either their own witch doctor or medical clinics set up by western missionaries. Kava is the popular drug of the island, although alcohol is becoming more prevalent. With the rising number of adults using alcohol, there is a rising crime rate, especially involving violence toward women, and tribal warfare. Economy and infrastructure Luganville is the only true town on the island; the rest of the island is dotted with small villages. From Luganville, three \\"main roads\\" emerge. Main Street leaves the town to the west and winds along the south coast of the island for about 40 km ending at the village of Tasiriki on the southwest coast. Canal Road runs along the southern and eastern coasts of the island, north through Hog Harbor and Golden Beach, ending at Port Olry. Big Bay Highway splits off from Canal Road near Turtle Bay on the east coast, runs generally west to the mountains, and then it leads north to Big Bay. The international airport is about five km east of the center of Luganville. Numerous rivers run to the coastline from the mountains of the island. The Sarakata River is the largest one, and it runs through Luganville. Many people on Espiritu Santo still rely on subsistence farming for their food. The villages on the island are mostly self-sufficient with their own vegetable gardens, chickens, and pigs. Taros and yams are commonly grown in these gardens, and these are mainstays of the local diet. Espiritu Santo is home to a number of cattle farms (including the famous Belmol Cattle Project, originally established by French settlers), and the island exports much of its beef to Japan, Australia, and other Pacific countries. Besides beef, tinned fish, and rice bought in town, Espiritu Santo has many foods that locals take for granted, and that tourists enjoy as delicacies. Among these are sweet pineapples, mangoes, island cabbage, flying foxes, and coconut crab, as well as local nuts such as natapoa and the sweet fleshy-fruit nouse. There is a market in Luganville where local food such as manioc, taro, yam, and cabbage; and other freshly grown island staples are sold. Several small supermarkets such as LCM, Unity Shell, and Au bon Marche sell groceries and many packaged goods. Biodiversity The island of Espiritu Santo is home to all of Vanuatu's endemic birds, including the Santo mountain starling, a species restricted entirely to Espiritu Santo. Two protected areas have been established to safeguard the island's biodiversity; the Loru Conservation Area on the east coast and the Vatthe Conservation area near Big Bay in the north. The Loru Rainforest Protected Area is situated in the lowland rainforests of Espiritu Santo. Established in 1993 by Chief Caleb Ser, the 220-hectare reserve supports a rich variety of Vanuatu's bird, bat, and plant life, as well as a diverse range of marine species in the two-kilometre stretch of fringing reef.

Its capital is Isulan and the commercial center is Tacurong. Etymology  The name Sultan Kudarat given to the province was derived from the Muslim ruler, Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat who begun to assert his leadership in the year 1619 and reigned in the Sultanate of Maguindanao from 1625 to 1671. Through his leadership, Spanish forced were successfully repelled from encroaching the Cotabato region of south-central Mindanao. He is considered a national hero, and in his honor the province was named after him. History Sultan Kudarat was part of the former province of Cotabato, until its creation as an independent province (along with Maguindanao and North Cotabato) on November 22, 1973, through Presidential Decree No. 341. = Palimbang massacre = One notable event that took place in Sultan Kudarat was the Palimbang Massacre (also called the Malisbong Masjid Massacre), which saw the mass murder of Moro residents of Barrio Malisbong in Palimbang by units of the Philippine Military on September 24, 1974,‚Äì1,500 two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law. Accounts compiled by the Moro Women's Center in General Santos City state that 1,500 male Moros aged 11‚Äì70 were killed inside a mosque, 3,000 women and children aged 9‚Äì60 were detained ‚Äì with the women being raped ‚Äì and that 300 houses were razed by the government forces. Geography Sultan Kudarat is situated on the southwestern section of central Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Maguindanao and North Cotabato; on the south by South Cotabato and Sarangani; on the east by Davao del Sur; and on the west by the Moro Gulf and the Celebes Sea. The province's total land area is . The Moro Gulf seen from Lebak Two major mountain ranges encompass the province; the Alip Mountain Range in Columbio and the Daguma Mountain Range within the towns of Bagumbayan, Isulan and Esperanza. The three coastal towns on the province's western side (Lebak, Kalamansig and Palimbang) are lined with mountain ranges that separate the central part of the province from the sea. There are also mountains on the eastern side, leaving flat land in between. The province has an irregular coastline of in its three coastal towns, which face the Celebes Sea. These coastal areas are prone to tsunamis coming from the Celebes Sea. Approximately 2/3 of Lake Buluan's area is covered by the province in the towns of Lutayan and President Quirino. There are 7 major rivers within the province: Alip, Allah, Kapingkong, Tran, Salaman, Palimbang and Kabulnan. Additionally, there are 23 large creeks and 11 major springs within the province. =Land use and soil types= Forestland constitutes majority of the province land use (50.32% ), followed by agricultural land (44.77%), fishing grounds (2.42%), non- agricultural land (1.16%), \\"other bodies of water\\" (1.02%), and fishponds (0.31%). Five major soil types are found within the province, majority of which is classified as Mountain Soil (71%), followed by Sandy Loam (12.036%), Silty Clay Loam (4.880%), Clay Loam (4.612%) and Loamy Sand (0.185). =Climate= The climate of Sultan Kudarat falls under Type IV of Climate (characterized by rain showers or evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year). Heavy rainfall occurs from April to November. Unlike most other provinces in the country, Sultan Kudarat is generally free from typhoons as it is situated outside the \\"typhoon belt\\". The average temperature is , with as the average maximum normally occurring in March. The lowest recorded was in the Kulaman area in December to early January. =Administrative divisions= Sultan Kudarat comprises 11 municipalities and 1 city. Three of the municipalities (Kalamansig, Lebak, and Palimbang) are coastal towns, while the rest of the province is located inland. The 11 municipalities and Tacurong City are further subdivided into 249 barangays. Tacurong City is the smallest unit in the province by land area, but is the most urbanized and is considered the province's commercial center. Other growth centers are Lebak and Isulan, the latter being the provincial capital. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" !

The harbour is an inlet of the Tasman Sea (part of the South Pacific Ocean). It is the location of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The location of the first European settlement and colony on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney. Port Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs. Thus, many botanists, see, e.g, Robert Brown's Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, described their specimens as having been collected at Port Jackson. Many recreational events are based on or around the harbour itself particularly the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations and the starting point of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. The waterways of Port Jackson are managed by the Roads & Maritime Services. Sydney Harbour National Park protects a number of islands and foreshore areas, swimming spots, bushwalking tracks and picnic areas. History Sydney Cove, Port Jackson in the County of Cumberland ‚Äì from a drawing made by Francis Fowkes in 1788. India played a vital role in establishing Sydney. Clipper ships in Darling Harbour in 1900 The land around Port Jackson was inhabited at the time of the European arrival and colonisation by the Eora clans, including the Gadigal, Cammeraygal, and Wangal. The Gadigal inhabited the land stretching along the south side of Port Jackson from what is now South Head, in an arc west to the present Darling Harbour. The Cammeraygal lived on the northern side of the harbour. The area along the southern banks of the Parramatta River to Rose Hill belonged to the Wangal. The Eora inhabited Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), south to the Georges River and west to Parramatta.Woollarawarre Bennelong quoted by Governor Arthur Phillip in a despatch to Lord Sydney, 13 February 1790 CO201/5, National Archives, Kew (London) =Cook's naming of Port Jackson= The first recorded European discovery of Sydney Harbour was by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. Cook named the inlet after Sir George Jackson, one of the Lord Commissioners of the British Admiralty, and Judge Advocate of the Fleet. As the Endeavour sailed past the entrance at Sydney Heads, Cook wrote in his journal \\"at noon we were...about 2 or 3 miles from the land and abrest of a bay or harbour within there appeared to be a safe anchorage which I called Port Jackson.\\" =First Fleet= Eighteen years later, on 21 January 1788, after arriving at Botany Bay, Governor Arthur Phillip took a longboat and two cutters up the coast to sound the entrance and examine Cook's Port Jackson. Phillip first stayed over night at Camp Cove, then moved down the harbour, landing at Sydney Cove and then Manly Cove before returning to Botany Bay on the afternoon of 24 January. Phillip returned to Sydney Cove in HM Armed Tender Supply on 26 January 1788, where he established the first colony in Australia, later to become the city of Sydney. In his first dispatch from the colony back to England, Governor Phillip noted that: =Later events= The Great White Fleet, the United States Navy battle fleet, arrived in Port Jackson in August 1908 by order of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. From 1938, seaplanes landed in Sydney Harbour on Rose Bay, making this Sydney's first international airport. =Attack on Sydney Harbour= Japanese K≈ç- hy≈çteki class midget submarine M-21 being raised from Taylor's Bay on 1 June 1942 In 1942, to protect Sydney Harbour from a submarine attack, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was constructed. It spanned the harbour from Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay to the battery at Georges Head, on the other side of the harbour. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines entered the harbour, one of which became entangled in the western end of the boom net's central section. Unable to free their submarine, the crew detonated charges, killing themselves in the process. A second midget submarine came to grief in Taylor's Bay, the two crew committing suicide. The third submarine fired two torpedoes at USS Chicago (both missed) before leaving the harbour. In November 2006, this submarine was found off Sydney's Northern Beaches. The anti-submarine boom net was demolished soon after World War II, and all that remains are the foundations of the old boom net winch house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay. Today, the Australian War Memorial has on display a composite of the two midget submarines salvaged from Sydney Harbour.NPWS plaque The conning tower of one of the midget submarines is on display at the RAN Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney. =Fortifications= Fort Denison is a former penal site and defensive facility occupying a small island located north-east of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney Harbour. There are fortifications at Sydney Heads and elsewhere, some of which are now heritage listed. The earliest date from the 1830s, and were designed to defend Sydney from seaborn attack or convict uprisings. There are four historical fortifications located between Taronga Zoo and Middle Head, Mosman, they are: the Middle Head Fortifications, the Georges Head Battery, the Lower Georges Heights Commanding Position and a small fort located on Bradleys Head, known as the Bradleys Head Fortification Complex. The forts were built from sandstone quarried on site and consist of various tunnels, underground rooms, open batteries and casemated batteries, shell rooms, gunpowder magazines, barracks and trenches. Geography The Harbour as seen aloft from Tasman Sea. The harbour is the focal point for the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations The Sydney central business district skyline viewed from the harbour Geologically, Port Jackson is a drowned river valley, or ria. It is 19 km long with an area of 55 km2. The estuary's volume at high tide is 562 million cubic metres. The perimeter of the estuary is 317 kilometres. According to the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, Port Jackson is \\"a harbour which comprises all the waters within an imaginary line joining North Head and South Head. Within this harbour lies North Harbour, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour.\\" Port Jackson extends westward from the single entrance known as Sydney Heads (North and South Heads) and encompasses all tidal waters within North Harbour, Middle Harbour, Sydney Harbour, Darling Harbour, Parramatta River and Lane Cove River.RAN Hydrographic Services Map of Port Jackson published in August 1972. The harbour is heavily embayed. The bays on the south side tend to be wide and rounded, whereas those on the north side are generally narrow inlets. Many of these bays include beaches. The Sydney central business district extends from Circular Quay. =Islands= There are several islands within the harbour, including Shark Island, Clark Island, Fort Denison, Goat Island, Cockatoo Island, Spectacle Island, Snapper Island and Rodd Island. Some other former islands, including Bennelong Island, Garden Island and Berry Island, have subsequently been linked to the shore by land reclamation, though their names often still contain the word \\"Island\\". Exposed at low tide is Sow and Pigs Reef, a well-known navigation obstacle near the main shipping lane. =Tributaries and waterways= * Tank Stream was a fresh water course emptying into Sydney Cove. Today it is little more than a storm water drain but originally it was the fresh water supply for the fledgling colony of New South Wales in the late 18th century. It originated from a swamp to the west of present-day Hyde Park and at high tide entered Sydney Cove at the intersection of Bridge and Pitt Streets. * Middle Harbour is the northern arm of Port Jackson. It begins as a small creek (Middle Harbour Creek) at St Ives.UBD Citylink Street Directory Page 155 Map reference F4 It joins the main waterway of Port Jackson between the two headlands, Middle Head and Grotto Point Reserve, adjacent to the Sydney Heads. * Parramatta River is the western arm of Port Jackson. The river begins at confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek west of Parramatta and joins the main waterway of Port Jackson between Greenwich Point, Greenwich, and Robinsons Point, Birchgrove.UBD City Link Street Directory Page191 Map Reference A12 * Lane Cove River rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi). Its catchment area is approximately 95.4 square kilometres (36.8 sq mi). * Tarban Creek, a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, enters Port Jackson at Hunters Hill. * Johnstons Creek is located in the inner-western suburbs of Glebe, Annandale, Forest Lodge and Stanmore. It rises in Stanmore and flows in a generally northward direction towards Rozelle Bay. The creek passes beneath the stands of the now demolished Harold Park Paceway prior to emptying into Rozelle Bay at Bicentennial Park Glebe. Orphan School Creek is a tributary of Johnstons Creek. * Duck River is a perennial stream and southern tributary of the Parramatta River. Infrastructure Opera House and Harbour Bridge =Bridges= The Anzac Bridge is on the righthand side with Glebe Island and White Bay on the lefthand side. Sydney Harbour Bridge and the CBD is in the background Port Jackson is bridged from north to south by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Gladesville Bridge, the Ryde Bridge, and the Silverwater Bridge. Other bridges spanning Port Jackson waterways are Pyrmont Bridge spanning Darling Harbour; the Anzac Bridge (formerly known as the Glebe Island Bridge), spanning Blackwattle Bay; the Iron Cove Bridge spanning Iron Cove; the Spit Bridge spanning Middle Harbour; the Roseville Bridge spanning Middle Harbour; the Tarban Creek Bridge spanning Tarban Creek. The original Meadowbank Bridge carried two railway tracks, now reduced to pedestrian traffic only. The new Meadowbank Bridge carries two railway tracks with piers suitable for four tracks. The is single track rail bridge on the Clyde to Carlingford railway line crosses the Parramatta River near Camellia. A new bridge over Homebush Bay connects Wentworth Point and Rhodes = Punts = * Mortlake Ferry = Weir = A weir at Queens Avenue, Parramatta separates the saltwater and tidal waters to the east from the freshwater and non-tidal waters to the west. =Tunnels= A road tunnel, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel passing underneath the Harbour to the east of the bridge was opened in August 1992. In 2005, 2010 and in 2014 the NSW Government proposed a rail tunnel be constructed to the west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Construction of an extra pair of road tunnels to the west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as part of the Sydney Metro project, was approved in January 2017 and is scheduled to start later in the year. =Cruise ship terminals= Carnival Spirit cruise ship in Sydney Cove in 2013 Permanent cruise ship terminals are located at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at Circular Quay, Sydney Cove and at the White Bay Cruise Terminal at White Bay. White Bay's evolution to a cruise terminal came with the closure of Darling Harbour terminal to make way for the Barangaroo development. =Other port facilities= White Bay and adjacent Glebe Island have been working ports since the mid-1800s, handling just about everything from timber and paper, coal, sugar and cement to cars and containers. The NSW Government identified both as vital to the City's economy and in March 2013 announced its commitment to maintaining both as working ports as it frees up neighbouring bays for public access. Glebe Island is Sydney's last remaining deepwater port able to supply the City's ongoing demand for dry bulk goods such as sugar, gypsum and cement. Most of Sydney's port infrastructure has moved south to Botany Bay since the construction of the first container terminals there in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Maritime transport SS Dee Why in 1930 Sydney Ferries operate services from Circular Quay to Manly, Mosman, Taronga Zoo, Watsons Bay, Rose Bay, Barangaroo, Balmain, Parramatta, Milsons Point and other destinations. Water taxi and water limousine operators offer transport not restricted by timetables or specific routes, and can also provide a service to or from private wharfs and houses on the waterfront. Sightseeing harbour cruises are operated daily from Circular Quay. Whale watching excursions are also operated from Port Jackson. The Mortlake Ferry, also known as the Putney Punt, crosses the Parramatta River, connecting Mortlake and Putney. Maritime heritage Sydney Heritage Fleet, Rozelle Bay Australian National Maritime Museum, at Darling Harbour, has themed exhibitions ranging from Indigenous lore and European seafaring to aquatic sport and maritime defence.Australian National Maritime Museum www.anmm.gov.au Sydney Heritage Fleet is a largely volunteer organisation dedicated to the restoration and operation of heritage vessels. The barque James Craig of the SHF sails regularly from Port Jackson.Sydney Heritage Fleet RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island has many exhibits, artefacts and documents relating to the history of the Royal Australian Navy. Port Jackson is associated with the voyages of Richard Siddins.  Heritage listings  Port Jackson has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Fort Denison * Goat Island * SS South Steyne * Bradleys Head: Bradleys Head Light Tower Derivative unit of measure A Sydharb is a unit of volume used in Australia for water, especially in dams and harbours.

Its capital is Alabel. With a coastline along the Sarangani Bay and Celebes Sea, the province is at the southernmost tip of Mindanao island, and borders South Cotabato and Davao del Sur to the north, Davao Occidental to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. Sarangani is part of the South Cotabato-Cotabato-Sultan Kudarat-Sarangani-General Santos () development cluster, and is linked by paved roads to the international airport and harbor of General Santos. The province is divided into two sections, separated by the Sarangani Bay and city of General Santos, and it used to be part of South Cotabato until it was made an independent province in 1992. History The earliest civilization in the province can be found in Maitum, Sarangani, where the Maitum Anthropomorphic Pottery or Maitum Jars were found. The jars have been dated to approximately 5 BC to 370 AD, one of the oldest in the entire Southeast Asian region and the Philippines. The discovery testified to the long history of cultural exchanges in Sarangani and its people. The island of Sarangani (now part of Davao Occidental) was named by Spanish explorer Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos in 1543 as Antonia, in honor of Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco who commissioned the Villalobos expedition to the Philippines. The early inhabitants who first inhabited Sarangani were the indigenous natives, called MunaTo, a native term for \\"first people.\\" balita.ph/2008, Man-made island resort now a Sarangani landmark the Province of Cotabato in 1918 In 1942, the Japanese troops occupied Southern Cotabato. In 1945, Filipino troops of the 6th, 10th, 101st and 102nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in and liberated Southern Cotabato and fought against the Japanese Imperial Army forces during the Battle of Cotabato at the end of World War II under the Japanese Occupation. Before its inception in 1992, Sarangani was part of South Cotabato as the Third District of South Cotabato. The province was created by Republic Act No. 7228 on March 16, 1992, penned by Congressman James L. Chiongbian. His wife, Priscilla L. Chiongbian, was the first Governor of Sarangani. Geography Sarangani covers a total area of occupying the southern tip of the Soccsksargen in central Mindanao. The province is bordered on the central-north by South Cotabato, northeast by Davao del Sur, east by Davao Occidental, south by the Sarangani Bay and Celebes Sea, and northwest by Sultan Kudarat. Maitum Sarangani is divided into two (eastern and western) sections, separated by the Sarangani Bay and General Santos in the middle.

This is accomplished by considering the geographic distribution of individuals in light of genetics, particularly population genetics. This term was introduced to describe geographically structured genetic signals within and among species. An explicit focus on a species' biogeography/biogeographical past sets phylogeography apart from classical population genetics and phylogenetics. Past events that can be inferred include population expansion, population bottlenecks, vicariance and migration. Recently developed approaches integrating coalescent theory or the genealogical history of alleles and distributional information can more accurately address the relative roles of these different historical forces in shaping current patterns. Development The term phylogeography was first used by John Avise in his 1987 work Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics. Historical biogeography addresses how historical, geological, climatic and ecological conditions influenced the current distribution of species. As part of historical biogeography, researchers had been evaluating the geographical and evolutionary relationships of organisms years before. Two developments during the 1960s and 1970s were particularly important in laying the groundwork for modern phylogeography; the first was the spread of cladistic thought, and the second was the development of plate tectonics theory. The resulting school of thought was vicariance biogeography, which explained the origin of new lineages through geological events like the drifting apart of continents or the formation of rivers. When a continuous population (or species) is divided by a new river or a new mountain range (i.e., a vicariance event), two populations (or species) are created. Paleogeography, geology and paleoecology are all important fields that supply information that is integrated into phylogeographic analyses. Phylogeography takes a population genetics and phylogenetic perspective on biogeography. In the mid-1970s, population genetic analyses turned to mitochondrial markers. The advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the process where millions of copies of a DNA segment can be replicated, was crucial in the development of phylogeography. Thanks to this breakthrough, the information contained in mitochondrial DNA sequences was much more accessible. Advances in both laboratory methods (e.g. capillary DNA sequencing technology) that allowed easier sequencing DNA and computational methods that make better use of the data (e.g. employing coalescent theory) have helped improve phylogeographic inference. Early phylogeographic work has recently been criticized for its narrative nature and lack of statistical rigor (i.e. it did not statistically test alternative hypotheses). The only real method was Alan Templeton's Nested Clade Analysis, which made use of an inference key to determine the validity of a given process in explaining the concordance between geographic distance and genetic relatedness. Recent approaches have taken a stronger statistical approach to phylogeography than was done initially. Example Climate change, such as the glaciation cycles of the past 2.4 million years, has periodically restricted some species into disjunct refugia. These restricted ranges may result in population bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Once a reversal in climate change allows for rapid migration out of refugial areas, these species spread rapidly into newly available habitat. A number of empirical studies find genetic signatures of both animal and plant species that support this scenario of refugia and postglacial expansion. This has occurred both in the tropics (where the main effect of glaciation is increasing aridity, i.e. the expansion of savanna and retraction of tropical rainforest) as well as temperate regions that were directly influenced by glaciers. Phylogeography and conservation Phylogeography can help in the prioritization of areas of high value for conservation. Phylogeographic analyses have also played an important role in defining evolutionary significant units (ESU), a unit of conservation below the species level that is often defined on unique geographic distribution and mitochondrial genetic patterns. A recent study on imperiled cave crayfish in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America demonstrates how phylogenetic analyses along with geographic distribution can aid in recognizing conservation priorities. Using phylogeographical approaches, the authors found that hidden within what was thought to be a single, widely distributed species, an ancient and previously undetected species was also present. Conservation decisions can now be made to ensure that both lineages received protection. Results like this are not an uncommon outcome from phylogeographic studies. An analysis of salamanders of the genus Eurycea, also in the Appalachians, found that the current taxonomy of the group greatly underestimated species level diversity. The authors of this study also found that patterns of phylogeographic diversity were more associated with historical (rather than modern) drainage connections, indicating that major shifts in the drainage patterns of the region played an important role in the generation of diversity of these salamanders. A thorough understanding of phylogeographic structure will thus allow informed choices in prioritizing areas for conservation. Comparative phylogeography poison frogs in South America. The field of comparative phylogeography seeks to explain the mechanisms responsible for the phylogenetic relationships and distribution of different species. For example, comparisons across multiple taxa can clarify the histories of biogeographical regions. For example, phylogeographic analyses of terrestrial vertebrates on the Baja California peninsula and marine fish on both the Pacific and gulf sides of the peninsula display genetic signatures that suggest a vicariance event affected multiple taxa during the Pleistocene or Pliocene. Phylogeography also gives an important historical perspective on community composition. History is relevant to regional and local diversity in two ways. One, the size and makeup of the regional species pool results from the balance of speciation and extinction. Two, at a local level community composition is influenced by the interaction between local extinction of species‚Äô populations and recolonization. A comparative phylogenetic approach in the Australian Wet Tropics indicates that regional patterns of species distribution and diversity are largely determined by local extinctions and subsequent recolonizations corresponding to climatic cycles. Phylogeography integrates biogeography and genetics to study in greater detail the lineal history of a species in context of the geoclimatic history of the planet. An example study of poison frogs living in the South American neotropics (illustrated to the left) is used to demonstrate how phylogeographers combine genetics and paleogeography to piece together the ecological history of organisms in their environments. Several major geoclimatic events have greatly influenced the biogeographic distribution of organisms in this area, including the isolation and reconnection of South America, the uplift of the Andes, an extensive Amazonian floodbasin system during the Miocene, the formation of Orinoco and Amazon drainages, and dry‚àíwet climate cycles throughout the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs. Using this contextual paleogeographic information (paleogeographic time series is shown in panels A-D) the authors of this study proposed a null-hypothesis that assumes no spatial structure and two alternative hypothesis involving dispersal and other biogeographic constraints (hypothesis are shown in panels E-G, listed as SMO, SM1, and SM2). The phylogeographers visited the ranges of each frog species to obtain tissue samples for genetic analysis; researchers can also obtain tissue samples from museum collections. The evolutionary history and relations among different poison frog species is reconstructed using phylogenetic trees derived from molecular data. The molecular trees are mapped in relation to paleogeographic history of the region for a complete phylogeographic study. The tree shown in the center of the figure has its branch lengths calibrated to a molecular clock, with the geological time bar shown at the bottom. The same phylogenetic tree is duplicated four more times to show where each lineage is distributed and is found (illustrated in the inset maps below, including Amazon basin, Andes, Guiana-Venezuela, Central America-Choc√≥). The combination of techniques used in this study exemplifies more generally how phylogeographic studies proceed and test for patterns of common influence. Paleogeographic data establishes geological time records for historical events that explain the branching patterns in the molecular trees. This study rejected the null model and found that the origin for all extant Amazonian poison frog species primarily stem from fourteen lineages that dispersed into their respective areas after the Miocene floodbasin receded. Regionally based phylogeographic studies of this type are repeated for different species as a means of independent testing. Phylogeographers find broadly concordant and repeated patterns among species in most regions of the planet that is due to a common influence of paleoclimatic history. Human phylogeography Phylogeography has also proven to be useful in understanding the origin and dispersal patterns of our own species, Homo sapiens. Based primarily on observations of skeletal remains of ancient human remains and estimations of their age, anthropologists proposed two competing hypotheses about human origins. The first hypothesis is referred to as the Out-of-Africa with replacement model, which contends that the last expansion out of Africa around 100,000 years ago resulted in the modern humans displacing all previous Homo spp. populations in Eurasia that were the result of an earlier wave of emigration out of Africa. The multiregional scenario claims that individuals from the recent expansion out of Africa intermingled genetically with those human populations of more ancient African emigrations. A phylogeographic study that uncovered a Mitochondrial Eve that lived in Africa 150,000 years ago provided early support for the Out-of-Africa model. While this study had its shortcomings, it received significant attention both within scientific circles and a wider audience. A more thorough phylogeographic analysis that used ten different genes instead of a single mitochondrial marker indicates that at least two major expansions out of Africa after the initial range extension of Homo erectus played an important role shaping the modern human gene pool and that recurrent genetic exchange is pervasive. These findings strongly demonstrated Africa's central role in the evolution of modern humans, but also indicated that the multiregional model had some validity. These studies have largely been supplanted by population genomic studies that use orders of magnitude more data. In light of these recent data from the 1000 genomes project, genomic-scale SNP databases sampling thousands of individuals globally and samples taken from two non-Homo sapiens hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans), the picture of human evolutionary has become more resolved and complex involving possible Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture, admixture with archaic African hominins, and Eurasian expansion into the Australasian region that predates the standard out of African expansion. Phylogeography of viruses Viruses are informative in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change due to their rapid mutation rate and fast generation time. Phylogeography is a useful tool in understanding the origins and distributions of different viral strains. A phylogeographic approach has been taken for many diseases that threaten human health, including dengue fever, rabies, influenza and HIV. Similarly, a phylogeographic approach will likely play a key role in understanding the vectors and spread of avian influenza (HPAI H5N1), demonstrating the relevance of phylogeography to the general public. Phylogeography of languages Phylogeographic analysis of ancient and modern languages has been used to test whether Indo-European languages originated in Anatolia or in the steppes of Central Asia. Language evolution was modeled in terms of the gain and loss of cognate words in each language over time, to produce a cladogram of related languages. Combining those data with known geographic ranges of each language produced strong support for an Anatolian origin approximately 8000‚Äì9500 years ago.

He served as the 36th Mayor of Los Angeles, California from 1953 to 1961, after having been a California State Assemblyman and then a member of the United States Congress. He was a Republican though the office of mayor is officially nonpartisan. Early life and career Charles Norris Poulson was born in Baker County, Oregon. He was the son of Peter Skovo Poulson (1843-1928) who was an immigrant from Denmark. Poulson attended Oregon State University in Corvallis for two years before he wed Erna June Loennig on December 25, 1916. The couple arrived in Los Angeles in 1923. Poulson became a certified public accountant through correspondence classes and night school at Southwestern Law School, which at that time had a business school. Political career =California State Assembly and U.S. Congress= In 1938, he was elected to the 56th District seat of the California State Assembly. He won a congressional seat four years later. After losing the seat in the 1944 election, he returned to the United States Congress following the 1946 elections, remaining there until his election as mayor of Los Angeles. During his years as a congressman, Poulson helped lead California in its fight against Arizona over Colorado River water. At the time of his departure from Congress, he was the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. =Los Angeles mayor= Poulson's victory in the Los Angeles mayoral race came after a contentious battle in which his opponent, incumbent mayor Fletcher Bowron, claimed that the Los Angeles Times wanted to control city government and, by endorsing Poulson, would have a puppet in the mayor's office. Poulson, for his part, challenged Bowron's support for public housing, in particular a project in the area known as Chavez Ravine in Elysian Park Heights (a site on which Dodger Stadium would one day be built). With the support of the group Citizens Against Socialist Housing (CASH) and drawing on the anti-communist atmosphere of the time, Poulson promised to end support for such \\"un-American\\" housing projects and to fire city employees who were communists or who refused to answer questions about their political activities. During his eight years as mayor, Los Angeles became the third largest city in the United States, with Poulson instrumental in leading the construction of the Los Angeles International Airport and expanding the Los Angeles Harbor. Most notably, he led the drive to lure baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles. This led to what became known as the Battle of Chavez Ravine which resulted in the removal of Hispanic residents from land on which Dodger Stadium was later constructed. He helped integrate the city's fire and police departments and initiated a garbage recycling program that proved to be a factor in his defeat in 1961. Perhaps the most memorable image of his mayoral career came on September 21, 1959, when he addressed Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a public ceremony. The comments came after Khrushchev had constantly touted Soviet superiority during his tour of the city by Poulson. Citing Khrushchev's phrase, \\"We will bury you,\\" Poulson responded, \\"You shall not bury us and we shall not bury you. We tell you in the friendliest terms possible we are planning no funerals, yours or our own.\\" Poulson received over 3,600 letters following the incident, many of them praising him for his comments. He lost a reelection campaign in 1961 to Sam Yorty, partly due to having to explain the expenses incurred by the Dodgers' franchise shift. Efforts to blunt such criticism were limited due to a severe case of laryngitis, which prevented him from responding to the invitation from local television personality George Putnam to debate Yorty on his show. Poulson never recovered from the laryngitis and his campaign never recovered from the setback. Following the defeat, Poulson briefly returned to accounting before moving to La Jolla, California in 1962. He died in 1982.C. Norris Poulson (New York Times) See also * George P.

Its capital is the city of Kidapawan. Some of its barangays are under the jurisdiction of the nearby Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. History =Early history= Limestone burial urns with myth- inspired patterns from Cotabato dating back 600 CE. Cotabato derives its name from the Maguindanao word kuta wato (from Malay - \\"Kota Batu\\"), meaning \\"stone fort\\", referring to the stone fort which served as the seat of Sultan Muhammad Kudarat in what is now Cotabato City (which the province derives its name from). Islam was introduced in this part of the country in the later part of the 15th century by Sharif Mohammed Kabungsuwan, an Arabo-Malay Muslim warrior-missionary. Sharif Kabungsuwan invaded Malabang in 1475, facing armed resistance from the non-Muslim natives, nevertheless successfully vanquishing and subjugating them to his (Islamic) rule through the might of his Samal warriors. Modern historians have pointed to the Cotabato delta as the medieval location of Toupo, the successor of the Maguindanao/Cotabato Sultanate. =Spanish occupation= Christianity was introduced in 1596, but the Spaniards were unable to penetrate into the region until the second half of the 19th century. The district of Cotabato was formed in 1860, covering the areas of what is now Cotabato, Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat provinces with its capital at Tamontaka. Fort Pikit was established by the Spaniards in 1893 as they continued their conquest of the remnants of Maguindanao Sultanate, which would soon be the site of one of the province's oldest towns, Pikit. =American occupation= The coming of the Americans ushered in the creation of the Moro Province on July 15, 1903, through Act No. 787 of the Philippine Commission. Cotabato, covering what are now the provinces of Cotabato, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato and Sarangani, became a district of the huge Moro province. During the American period, large companies were established in Cotabato to exploit the vast timber resources of the region. By the 1930s, settlers from Luzon and Visayas established homesteads in Cotabato. =World War II= In December 1941, Japanese planes bombed and invaded Cotabato. In 1942, Cotabato was occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces. A military headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army existed in Cotabato from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the Philippine Constabulary 10th Constabulary Regiment was stationed in Cotobato from October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946. Moro guerrilla fighters operating in the province of Cotabato helped local forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary 10th Constabulary Regiment fight against the Imperial Japanese Army until 1944. The Moro guerrillas fought the Japanese troops until liberation. In 1945, Cotabato was recaptured from the Japanese Imperial forces by the combined Filipino and American troops together with the recognized Moro guerrilla units. The guerrillas used the traditional Moro Kampilan, Barong and Kris swords as their weapons. =Postwar era= The pace of settlement in the region accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s. The former province of Cotabato was once the largest in the Philippines. In 1966, South Cotabato was created as a separate province. Mindanao, including Cotabato, was relatively peaceful in the 1950s and the mid-1960s. While there were some ethnic tensions, there was essentially no presence of secessionists groups in Mindanao yet. =Martial law era= The relative peace of the postwar era began to change in the last years of President Ferdinand Marcos' first term, when news about the Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements. None of these groups had enough followers to form a viable opposition until Marcos declared Martial Law, but when political parties were dissolved upon the proclamation of Martial Law in September 1972, it became easy for the armed secessionist group known as the Moro National Liberation Front to consolidate power, and the decades-long Moro conflict began in earnest. One major event of Martial law which took place in Cotabato was the Manili massacre, which saw the mass murder of 70 to 79 Moros, including women and children, committed in a mosque in Manili, Carmen, North Cotabato, Philippines on June 19, 1971. The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with Christian groups when a group of armed men suspected to be part of the Ilaga militant group opened fire on them. On November 22, 1973, through Presidential Decree No. 341, what remained of the old Cotabato was further divided into the provinces of North Cotabato, Maguindanao, and Sultan Kudarat. North Cotabato was later renamed Cotabato through Batas Pambansa Blg. 660 approved on March 7, 1984. =Recent history= In 1992, the province of Sarangani was formed out of South Cotabato. Cotabato now comprises the capital city of Kidapawan and 17 municipalities. By the aftermath of the plebiscite to form the autonomous administrative region of Bangsamoro in February 2019, 63 barangays from Cotabato's western municipalities, all of which inhabited mostly by Muslim natives, opted to join the newly-formed region. This will result in the reduction of the number of barangays the province currently administers after the national midterm elections on 13 May 2019. Geography Cotabato covers a total area of occupying the northeastern tip of Region XII and is centrally located in Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Bukidnon, on the east by Davao City and Davao del Norte, on the west by Maguindanao and on the southeast by Sultan Kudarat and Davao del Sur. Cotabato is strategically linked to the major \\"Arterial Road System\\" that traverses and connects the province to Davao City - Soccsksargen - Cotabato Corridor. The Cotabato via Kabacan - Maramag - Kibawe, Bukidnon Sayre Highway meanwhile serves as its link to the Cagayan de Oro-Iligan City Corridor. Cotabato stretches from the east at Mount Apo, which separates it from Davao, to the Piapayungan Range on its boundary with Lanao in the west. Between these highlands is the basin of the Pulangi River or Rio Grande de Mindanao, the second longest in the Philippines at , which rises in Bukidnon and flows south to Maguindanao and Illana Bay. The province's fertile plains are traversed by tributaries of this great river. Typhoons do not pass through Cotabato and rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. =Administrative divisions= Cotabato comprises 17 municipalities and one city. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text- align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" - !

During 2010-2016 Administration, the Bangsamoro ideal sprouted and a newly proposed region was in the making. According to the agreements signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Administration of Noynoy Aquino, Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro because of the two out of twenty-eight barangays that voted in favor of joining the Muslim region back in 2001. Unfortunately, Bangsamoro was not implemented before the term of Aquino ended. Despite this, the current administration aims to establish a Federal Government, where Bangamoro will be realized into a State of the Philippines wherein Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro. Plans to establish a new municipality in the south of Carmen so that the indigenous and Christian central and northern part of Carmen will be retained in North Cotabato has yet to be confirmed. The idea arose because once the entire municipality of Carmen is included in Bangsamoro, the province of North Cotabato will be cut into half, leaving three towns (Banisilan, Alamada, and Libungan) at its west without connection to the center of North Cotabato, isolating these towns in the process. The issue was partially resolved when the second part of the plebiscite was conducted on 6 February 2019, when 63 barangay from the towns of Pigkawayan, Libungan, Midsayap, Aleosan, Carmen, Banisilan and Pikit opted to join the new administrative autonomous region of Bangsamoro after the results of the region's formation plebiscite were confirmed three days later on 9 February. However, these barangays are only to join the adjacent province of Maguindanao as parts of the said province's nearby and respective municipalities or to cluster on their own as new municipalities within the said province after the national midterm elections on 13 May 2019, and only then would the size and population of Cotabato province would truly diminish as the leaving barangays would no longer officially be parts of the province. Demographics Based on the , Cotabato has an overall population of . The average population growth rate was 2.27% in the period 2010‚Äì2015, which is higher than the national average of 1.72%. The province had a density of . Cotabato is an ethnoliguistically diverse province. The first Visayan settlers reached the town of Pikit in 1913, and since then, Christian migrants have moved and lived in Cotabato, cohabitating the province with the local indigenous groups. 71% of Cotabato's population descended from settlers who migrated from the Visayas and Luzon, while the remaining 18% belong to the communities of Magindanaons, Iranuns, Ilianens, Dulangan Manobo, Obo, Tagabawa, and Tboli. The major languages spoken are Hiligaynon (46%), Maguindanao (38%), Cebuano (8%), and Ilocano (4%). =Religion= Cotabato's population is majority Christian. According to the 2010 census,https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/NORTH%20COTABATO_FINAL%20PDF.pdf 51.2% of the population are Roman Catholic. Muslims form 26% of the population. The other significant minorities are Evangelical Christians at 8.4% of the population and Iglesia Ni Cristo which forms 1.9% of the Province population. In 2015 the Philippine Statistics Authority recorded Islam followed by 39.28% of the population. Economy Cotabato is considered a major food basket in Mindanao. It is a top producer of cereals, tropical fruits, vegetables, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, freshwater fish and livestock. It is also one of the country's leading producers of raw and semi-processed rubber and industrial trees, with markets in Asia and Europe. Among its major natural assets are Mt. Apo, the country's highest peak at above sea level, the Pulangi River which is a major contributor to Mindanao's irrigation system and hydro-electric energy, and the vast Liguasan Marsh which not only supplies a bounty of freshwater fish and organic fertilizer but considered as a possible source as well of natural gas. Power utility in the province comes from two energy sources - the NAPOCOR Agus Grid in Iligan transmitted through its Tacurong Substations and the Mindanao 1 Geothermal Power Plant at the foot of Mt. Apo in Ilomavis, Kidapawan City which produces 97 megawatts of electricity. Power distribution is handled by Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. (COTELCO). The province has a road network connecting the major centers to each other and the outlying barangays, and communication linkage through NDD-IDD, fax, cellular phone and the internet is available. Government President Benigno Aquino III signed the law dividing to new 3 legislative district of Cotabato on September 14, 2012.

An autecological approach differs from both community ecology (synecology) and population ecology by greater recognition of the species-specific adaptations of individual animals, plants or other organisms, and of environmental over density-dependent influences on species distributions. Autecological theory relates the species-specific requirements and environmental tolerances of individuals to the geographic distribution of the species, with individuals tracking suitable conditions, having the capacity for migration at at least one stage in their life cycles.name=Walter2014> Autecology has a strong grounding in evolutionary theory, including the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the recognition concept of species. History Autecology was pioneered by German field botanists in the late 19th century.Cittadino E. 1990. Nature as the Laboratory. Darwinian Plant Ecology in the German Empire, 1880-1900. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. During the 20th century, autecology continued to exist mainly as a descriptive science rather than one with supporting theory and the most notable proponents of an autecological approach, Herbert Andrewartha and Charles Birch, avoided the term autecology when referring to species-focused ecological investigation with emphasis on density-independent processes. Part of the problem with deriving a theoretical structure for autecology is that individual species are unique in their life history and behaviour, making it difficult to draw broad generalisations across them without losing the crucial information that is gained by studying biology at a species level.name=Walter2014/ Progress has been made in more recent times with Paterson‚Äôs recognition concept of species and the concept of habitat tracking by organisms.Hengeveld R. 1985. Dynamics of Dutch beetle species during the twentieth century (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Journal of Biogeography 12: 389-411. The most recent attempt at deriving a theoretical structure for autecology was published in 2014 by ecologists Gimme Walter and Rob Hengeveld. Basic theory =Recognition concept= Autecological theory is focused on species as the most important unit of biological organisation, as individuals across all populations of a particular species share species- specific adaptations that influence their ecology. This particularly relates to reproduction, as individuals of a sexual species share unique adaptations (e.g. courtship songs, pheromones) for recognising potential mates, and share a fertilisation mechanism that differs from those in all other species. This recognition concept of species differs from the biological species concept (or isolation concept) which defines species by cross-mating sterility, which in allopatric speciation is merely a consequence of adaptive change in a new species' fertilisation mechanism to suit a different environment. =Environmental matching= Individuals from across a species' range tend to be relatively uniform in terms of their dietary and habitat requirements and the range of environmental conditions they can tolerate. These differ from those of other species. Individuals of a species likewise share specific sensory adaptations for recognising suitable habitat. Seasonal changes and variability in climate mean that the spatial and/or temporal distribution of suitable habitat for a species also varies. In response, organisms track suitable conditions, for example by migrating in order to remain within suitable habitat, for which there is evidence in the fossil record.Turner A and Paterson H (1991) Species and speciation: evolutionary tempo and mode in the fossil record reconsidered. Geobios 24:761-769. By determining the requirements and tolerances of a particular species, it is possible to predict how individuals of that species will respond to specific environmental changes =Population sizes and replacement level reproduction= Autecological theory predicts that populations will reproduce at around replacement level unless a period of environmental change causing unusually high or low survival causes the population to grow or shrink before restabilising at replacement level again.Robin J-P, Denis V. 1999. Squid stock fluctuations and water temperature: temporal analysis of English Channel Loliginidae. Journal of Applied Ecology 36: 101-110. Population numbers may be reduced by introduction of new predation pressure, such as with poor fisheries management or introduction of a biological control agent to control an invasive species, such that net reproductive rate, R0, drops below replacement level. The species being preyed upon in each case may stabilise at a lower population density where it is more difficult for individuals of the higher trophic level to locate the prey species, but at this point relieving predation tends to make little difference to population size, as individuals continue to reproduce around replacement level as they were at a higher density prior to the introduction of a higher trophic level.Walter GH (2003) Insect Pest Management and Ecological Research Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Applications =Pest management= =Biological control= =Conservation autecology= Knowledge of species-level interactions, tolerances and habitat requirements is valuable for conservation of an endangered plant or animal species by ensuring its particular ecological requirements are met.Gonzalez-Benito E, Martin C and Iriondo JM (1995) Autecology and conservation of Erodium paularense Fdez.

While known primarily for his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Reiser later played for the Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cleveland Indians. Early career A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Reiser originally signed with his hometown Cardinals, but at age 19 he was among a group of minor league players declared free agents by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Reportedly, Cardinal general manager Branch Rickey‚Äîmortified at losing a player of Reiser's caliber‚Äîarranged for the Dodgers to sign Reiser, hide him in the minors, then trade him back to St. Louis at a later date. But Reiser's stellar performances in spring training in both 1939 and 1940 forced the Dodgers to keep him.Golenbock, Peter. Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers. (Rickey would become GM of the Dodgers after the 1942 season and witness Reiser's injury-caused decline as a great talent.) Being injury-prone In 1941, his first season as a regular starter, Reiser helped the Dodgers win the pennant for the first time since 1920. He was a sensation that year, winning the National League batting title while leading the league in doubles, triples, runs scored and slugging percentage. He was also named a starter to the All-Star team and placed second in MVP balloting. On July 19 of the following year, Reiser crashed face-first into the outfield wall in St. Louis, trying to catch what turned out to be a game-winning inside-the-park home run by Enos Slaughter of the rival Cardinals in the bottom of the 11th inning. The loss cut the Dodgers' lead over the Cardinals to six games. Despite missing just four games with the resulting concussion, he batted only .244 over his final 48 games that season, dropping his batting average from .350 to .310 for the year. The Dodgers ended up losing the pennant by two games to the Cardinals, who won 20 of their last 23 games and eventually the World Series. Reiser gave great effort on every play in the field, and was therefore very injury-prone. He fractured his skull running into an outfield wall on one occasion (but still made the throw back to the infield), was temporarily paralyzed on another, and was taken off the field on a stretcher a record 11 times. Leo Durocher, who was Reiser's first major league manager, reflected many years later that in terms of talent, skill and potential, there was only one other player comparable to Reiser: Willie Mays. He also said, \\"Pete had more power than Willie‚Äîleft-handed and right-handed both. He had everything but luck.\\"Durocher, Leo. Nice Guys Finish Last. Reiser, a switch hitter who sometimes restricted himself to batting left-handed because of injury, served in the United States Army during World War II, playing baseball for Army teams. While serving, he was injured again and had to learn to throw with both arms. Durocher said, \\"And he could throw at least as good as Willie [Mays, both] right-handed and left-handed.\\" When Reiser returned to the majors in 1946, he was still suffering from a shoulder injury from playing Army baseball.Honig, Donald. Baseball When the Grass Was Real. He later said: \\"It wasn't as serious as the head injuries, but it did more to end my career. The shoulder kept popping out of place, more bone chips developed, and there was constant pain in the arm and shoulder.\\" He was never the same hitter he was early in his career, but was still as fast as ever, stealing home a record seven times in 1946. In 1948, Ebbets Field became the first ballpark with padded outfield walls due to Reiser's penchant for running into them.Aronoff, J. Going, Going ... Caught! Baseball's Great Outfield Catches as Described by Those Who Saw Them, 1887-1964. McFarland (2009), p. 33. Later life Reiser managed in the minors for several years (including the Kokomo Dodgers in 1956‚Äì57,Boyle, Robert H. (September 2, 1957). Pete In The Bush, Sports Illustrated, Retrieved December 10, 2010 (detailed article profiling Reiser at Kokomo)(October 27, 1981). Reckless Reiser Dead at 62, Windsor Star, Retrieved December 10, 2010 (\\"for two years managed the Kokomo Dodgers in the Class D Midwest League\\") among others), winning the 1959 Minor League Manager of the Year Award from The Sporting News. He served as a coach on Walter Alston's Los Angeles Dodger staff from 1960 to 1964 (including the 1963 world championship team). However, he was forced out in 1965 as manager of the AAA Spokane Indians as the result of a heart attack. His replacement was Duke Snider‚Äîthe man who had once replaced him as Brooklyn Dodger center fielder. When Leo Durocher became manager of the Chicago Cubs in 1966, he brought many of his former players to coach on his staff. Reiser was one of them (1966‚Äì1969; 1972‚Äì1974). He also coached for the California Angels in 1970‚Äì71. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book \\"The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.\\" They used what they called \\"Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome\\" to explain why a truly exceptional player whose career was curtailed by injury‚Äîdespite not having had career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats‚Äîshould nonetheless be included on their list. Reiser died in Palm Springs, California, of respiratory disease at 62, and was buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

It involves the coach releasing players in the forward line from their set positions and directing them to the opposition forward area, congesting the area and making it more difficult for the opposition to score. It is commonly deployed to protect a lead, to stop a rout or as a counterattack tactic based on rebounding the ball to an open forward line. This is possible due to the lack of an offside rule or similar restrictions on players field movements. The extreme defensive tactic is often bemoaned by spectators and generally regarded as \\"ugly\\" football. History When Australian Football took to the parks around the colony of Victoria in 1858, there were no rules regarding player positions. Even today the rules only declare that a maximum of four per side is allowed in the centre square at the ball-up (ruck, rover, ruck-rover and centre) and 6 must start within each 50m arc, while during general play, all players are free to position themselves as they see fit. In early years this resulted in a pack of players moving with the ball up and down the field trying to get a clearing kick into space that the pack would then run into and repeat the process. Such a process is still evident in some junior leagues (the under 8 years old children) and is known as \\"beehive football\\". It was not until 1898 that player positions became regular thanks to Essendon's now famous positions of players around the field. The positioning provided many lopsided contests against teams trying to play pack football, such as beating St Kilda 10.11 (71) to 1.9 (15) on July 23 and Melbourne 11.9 (75) to 2.8 (20) on August 1 in 1898. Other teams mimicked the idea and the \\"lines of three\\" quickly became, and still is, the norm. One of the earliest records of flooding comes from an 1860s match between the Geelong Football Club and the Ballarat Football Club in Ballarat. Goalless and kicking against the gale, Geelong captain Tom Wills ordered every player into the backline. The Ballarat fans yelled abuse. Melbourne Football Club later successfully copied the tactic.Greg de Moore. Melbourne Football Club 2009 Season Guide. Page 43. In VFL football times, the 1909 VFL Grand Final in which South Melbourne, mindful of a Carlton side which beat them in round 11 after trailing 0.11 to South's 4.4 at half-time, packed the arc in the Grand Final after half time to thwart Carlton's advance. South won the final by two points. Over the years many teams have put extra men in the defensive 50 metre zone to stifle attacks, usually to stop great full-forwards or protect a lead. It was not uncommon for forwards such as Gordon Coventry, John Coleman, Tony Lockett, Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett, Sr., among others, to be seen fighting off three defenders to take a mark. Flooding the defensive zone outright was a rarity due to the level of endurance required from the entire team. However it was used defensively on occasion to avoid a rout. Flooding in modern professional football As football at the elite level increased in professionalism and athleticism, the practice increased. =As an offensive tactic= Flooding first became an offensive tactic when Rodney Eade became the Sydney Swans head coach in 1996. In order to give star forward Tony Lockett the most room on the small Sydney Cricket Ground he had the team play an extra \\"line of three\\" in defence when the opposition had the ball, creating a set-up with 9 defenders, 6 midfielders and three forwards. The idea was to create a forced error and turn-over, followed by swift movement to Lockett who had ample space to lead into. This was similar to Denis Pagan's \\"Pagan's Paddock\\" which gave Wayne Carey wide space to manoeuvre in. The Swans used this tactic to great effect in 1996, reaching the Grand Final, and subsequently winning in 2005. =As a defensive tactic= Terry Wallace became infamous for the \\"superflood\\" that he employed in the Round 21 game between the Western Bulldogs and Essendon at Colonial Stadium in 2000. Wallace successfully quelled the Bombers' scoring power and defeated the team which had won the previous 20 games by playing 14 of the 18 men on the field in the defensive zone for the entirety of the game, and often with all 18 players taking up positions in the 50 metre arc.

Widely considered as one of the great exponents of Brazilian music, Jobim internationalized bossa nova and, with the help of important American artists, merged it with jazz in the 1960s to create a new sound with remarkable popular success. As such he is sometimes known as the \\"father of bossa nova\\". Jobim was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally. In 1965, the album Getz/Gilberto was the first jazz album to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It also won for Best Jazz Instrumental Album ‚Äì Individual or Group and for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. The album's single \\"Garota de Ipanema\\" (\\"The Girl from Ipanema\\"), one of the most recorded songs of all time, won the Record of the Year. Jobim composed many songs that are now included in jazz and pop standard repertoires. The song \\"Garota de Ipanema\\" has been recorded over 240 times by other artists.

When Ant√¥nio was still an infant, his parents separated and his mother moved with her children (Ant√¥nio Carlos and his sister Helena Isaura, born February 23, 1931) to Ipanema, the beachside neighborhood the composer would later celebrate in his songs. In 1935, when the elder Jobim died, Nilza married Celso da Frota Pessoa (died February 2, 1979), who would encourage his stepson's career. He was the one who gave Jobim his first piano. As a young man of limited means, Jobim earned his living by playing in nightclubs and bars and later as an arranger for a recording label, before starting to achieve success as a composer. = Musical influences = Jobim's musical roots were planted firmly in the work of Pixinguinha, the legendary musician and composer who began modern Brazilian music in the 1930s. Among his teachers were L√∫cia Branco and, from 1941 on, Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, a German composer who lived in Brazil and introduced atonal and twelve-tone composition in the country. Jobim was also influenced by the French composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and by the Brazilian composers Ary Barroso and Heitor Villa-Lobos, who has been described as Jobim's \\"most important musical influence.\\" Among many themes, his lyrics talked about love, self-discovery, betrayal, joy and especially about the birds and natural wonders of Brazil, like the \\"Mata Atl√¢ntica\\" forest, characters of Brazilian folklore and his home city of Rio de Janeiro. Career In the 1940s, Tom Jobim started to play piano in bars and nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro and in the first years of the 1950s he worked as an arranger in the Continental Studio, where he had his first composition recorded, in April 1953, when the Brazilian singer Mauricy Moura recorded Incerteza, a composition by Tom Jobim with Lyrics by Newton Mendon√ßa. Jobim became prominent in Brazil when he teamed up with poet and diplomat Vinicius de Moraes to write the music for the play Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o (1956). The most popular song from the show was \\"Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voc√™\\" (\\"If Everyone Were Like You\\"). Later, when the play was adapted into a film, producer Sacha Gordine did not want to use any of the existing music from the play. Gordine asked de Moraes and Jobim for a new score for the film Orfeu Negro, or Black Orpheus (1959). Moraes was at the time away in Montevideo, Uruguay, working for the Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and so he and Jobim were only able to write three songs, primarily over the telephone (\\"A felicidade\\", \\"Frevo\\" and \\"O nosso amor\\"). This collaboration proved successful, and de Moraes went on to pen the lyrics to some of Jobim's most popular songs. In 1958 the Brazilian singer and guitarist Jo√£o Gilberto recorded his first album with two of the most famous songs of Tom Jobim: Desafinado and Chega de Saudade. This album inaugurates the Bossa Nova movement in Brazil. The sophisticated harmonies of his songs caught the attention of jazz musicians in the United States, principally after the first performance of Tom Jobim at Carnegie Hall, in 1962. Jobim in 1972 (National Archives of Brazil) A key event in making Jobim's music known in the English- speaking world was his collaboration with the American jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, the Brazilian singer Jo√£o Gilberto, and Gilberto's wife at the time, Astrud Gilberto, which resulted in two albums, Getz/Gilberto (1963) and Getz/Gilberto Vol. 2 (1964). The release of Getz/Gilberto created a bossa nova craze in the United States and subsequently internationally. Getz had previously recorded Jazz Samba with Charlie Byrd (1962), and Jazz Samba Encore! with Luiz Bonf√° (1964). Jobim wrote many of the songs on Getz/Gilberto, which became one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time, and turned Astrud Gilberto, who sang on \\"Garota de Ipanema\\" (The Girl from Ipanema) and \\"Corcovado\\", into an international sensation. At the Grammy Awards of 1965 Getz/Gilberto won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group and the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Among his later hits is \\"√Åguas de Mar√ßo\\" (Waters of March, 1972), for which he wrote both the Portuguese and English lyrics. Personal life Jobim was married to Thereza Otero Hermanny on October 15, 1949, and had two children with her: Paulo Jobim (born 1950), an architect and musician, married and father of Daniel Jobim (born 1973) and Dora Jobim (born 1976); and Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Jobim (born 1957), a painter. Jobim and Thereza divorced in 1978. On April 30, 1986, he married 29-year-old photographer Ana Beatriz Lontra, with whom he had two more children: Jo√£o Francisco Jobim (1979‚Äì1998) and Maria Luiza Helena Jobim (born 1987). Daniel, Paulo's son, followed his grandfather to become a pianist and composer, and performed \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Death Saint John the Baptist Cemetery, Rio de Janeiro In early 1994, after finishing his album Antonio Brasileiro, Jobim complained to his doctor, Roberto Hugo Costa Lima, of urinary problems. He underwent an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City on December 2, 1994. On December 8, while recovering from surgery, he had a cardiac arrest caused by a pulmonary embolism, and two hours later another cardiac arrest, from which he died.Cabral, Sergio (2008): Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim ‚Äì Uma Biografia (1st Edition). S√£o Paulo, Brazil: IBEP Nacional. He was survived by his children and grandchildren. His last album, Antonio Brasileiro, was released posthumously three days after his death. His body lay in state until given a proper burial on December 20, 1994. He is buried in the Cemit√©rio S√£o Jo√£o Batista in Rio de Janeiro.The Guardian  Legacy  Jobim is widely regarded as one of the most important songwriters of the 20th century. Many of his songs are jazz standards. American jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra prominently featured Jobim's songs on their albums Ella Abra√ßa Jobim (1981) and Francis Albert Sinatra & Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim (1967), respectively. The 1996 CD Wave: The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook included performances of Jobim tunes by Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Toots Thielemans. Jobim was an innovator in the use of sophisticated harmonic structures in popular song. Some of his melodic twists, like the melody insisting on the major seventh of the chord, became commonplace in jazz after he used them.MacDowell, Jo√£o; The Harmonic Development of Brazilian Song, Rio de Janeiro,1999. The Brazilian collaborators and interpreters of Jobim's music include Vinicius de Moraes, Jo√£o Gilberto (often credited as a co-creator or creator of bossa nova), Chico Buarque, Gal Costa, Elis Regina, S√©rgio Mendes, Astrud Gilberto and Flora Purim. Eumir Deodato and the conductor/composer Claus Ogerman arranged many recordings of Jobim tunes.Red Bull Music Academy (2005) Eumir Deodato ‚Äì Boy from Rio Pt. 1, Accessed December 6, 2006. He won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012. As a posthumous homage, on January 5, 1999, the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro changed the name of Rio's Gale√£o International Airport, located on Governador Island, to bear the composer's name. Gale√£o Airport is explicitly mentioned in his composition \\"Samba do Avi√£o\\". In 2014, Jobim was posthumously inducted to the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2015, Billboard named Jobim as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time. American contemporary jazz singer Michael Franks dedicated his 1995 album Abandoned Garden to the memory of Jobim. English singer/songwriter George Michael frequently acknowledged Jobim's influence. His 1996 album Older was dedicated to Jobim, and he recorded \\"Desafinado\\" on Red Hot + Rio (1996) with Astrud Gilberto. The official mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Tom, was named after him.

History In late 1990, the band originally started under the name Enthrone by Nattefrost (then bearing the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu) and Nordavind (who used the pseudonym Lord Karnstein). Together they produced a self-released demo tape, Black Winds, in 1991. In 1992, Enthrone changed its name to \\"Carpathian Forest\\", and Lord Blackmangler and Damnatus joined their line-up. As a quartet they self-released three demo tapes: Rehearsal Outtake, Bloodlust and Perversion (both in 1992) and Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern (in 1993). However, Damnatus and Lord Blackmangler left afterwards, and Carpathian Forest became once more a duo. Carpathian Forest would release their first studio work in 1995: the extended play Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods, via Avantgarde Music. It would be their first of many releases via Avantgarde. In 1998 the band released their first full-length album, Black Shining Leather, once more via Avantgarde Music. It was their only release to feature Lazare (who would later join Borknagar) on the band's line-up as a drummer. In the same year they also played their first concert at the Under the Black Sun Festival in Sch√∂nermark, Germany. Lazare left Carpathian Forest in 1999, the same year Anders Kobro, Tchort and Daniel Vrangsinn joined them as permanent members. In the following year, their second full-length, Strange Old Brew, was released. It was their most experimental album so far. By the end of the year they also released a single, \\"He's Turning Blue\\". In 2001, founding member Nordavind left Carpathian Forest, during the recording sessions of their third studio album, Morbid Fascination of Death, that still retained the experimentation (although to a lesser extent) of their previous release, Strange Old Brew. In the following year the compilation album We're Going to Hell for This: Over a Decade of Perversions was released, in order to celebrate the band's 10th anniversary as Carpathian Forest. It was their last album to be released by Avantgarde Music before they switched on to Season of Mist. Their fourth full-length, Defending the Throne of Evil, was released in 2003 by Season of Mist. Contrasting with Carpathian Forest's previous releases, it was their most melodic album so far, almost reminiscent of symphonic black metal. In late 2003 the band was joined by G√∏ran \\"Blood Pervertor\\" Bomann. 2004 saw the release of a live DVD, We're Going to Hollywood for This, and a compilation album featuring rarities and reworked versions of old Carpathian Forest songs, Skjend hans lik (Norwegian for \\"Desecrate His Body\\"). Carpathian Forest's latest release was the 2006 studio album Fuck You All!!!! Caput tuum in ano est, that was a throwback to their early, blackened thrash metal-like sonority of their debut. In an early 2008 issue of Terrorizer, Tchort spoke about the possibility of a new album, and the rumors circulating regarding a \\"half-finished album\\". He is quoted as saying: \\"I met with Nattefrost a few weeks ago and we decided to focus on a new album, but we haven't even started writing it yet. The news that we had an album half-finished was based on the fact that we had material left over from the last album. Since we record in different studios, this meant that I had the basics for music that Nattefrost never heard\\". He also divulged that \\"[we] kind of decided on a slightly new direction for the band, compared to Fuck You All, at least\\". The band frontlined the Inferno Festival in 2009, and confirmed rumors that a new album was in the works. The band entered on a relative hiatus after 2009, but from 2012 onwards they began to play on some festivals around Europe. The band was scheduled to play on the Maryland Deathfest on May 26, 2013, but their show had to be cancelled due to last- minute visa problems. The band's last-known concert was at Incineration Fest, in London England in May 2019. In the band's concerts in 2013‚Äì2014, Jonathan Perez from Green Carnation (and former Sirenia and Trail Of Tears) stepped in as their livedrummer. The band went on hiatus in July 2014, after Tchort and Blood Pervertor announced they had parted ways with Carpathian Forest, and would form a new band called The 3rd Attempt. In 2017, the band returned, and announced that they were working on a new album which would be called Likskue, to be released in 2018.

making a capture (except kings) changes colour.Andernach Chess by Joost de Heer and Otto Janko For instance, if a white bishop on a2 were to capture a black knight on g8, the end result would be a black bishop on g8. Non-capturing moves are played as in orthodox chess. If a pawn captures on eighth rank, it is promoted first and then changes colour. The game was named after the German town of Andernach, which is the site of annual meetings of fairy chess enthusiasts. It was during the 1993 meeting there that Andernach chess was introduced with a chess problem composing tournament for Andernach problems. It has since become a popular variant in problem composition, though it has not yet become popular as a game-playing variant. Example problem An example Andernach chess problem is shown in the diagram. The task is to find a proof game, which would last three moves and lead to the position shown. The solution is: :1. Nf3 Nc6 2. Ne5 Nxe5(=wN) The black knight turns into a white knight after capture on e5. White can now move this knight. :3. Nxd7(=bN) This time a white knight turns into a black knight. :3... Nb8 (see diagram) Variations Predecessor of Andernach chess was Tibetan chess, in which the black units (called lamas) change colour and piece type when capturing white pieces of a different type. As in Andernach chess, the king is not affected by capture. For example, if a black pawn on d7 captures a white queen on c6, it becomes a white queen and can be moved by White on the next move. This game is not related to Chandraki, a chess variant played in Tibet.Chandraki, the Tibetan Chess by Jean-Louis Cazaux. A variant on Andernach chess is anti-Andernach, in which pieces except kings change colour after non-captures, but stay the same colour after a capture. There is also super-Andernach in which all pieces except kings change colour after every move, whether a capture or not. Super-Andernach was introduced by John Rice in The Problemist Supplement in March 2006.

The picture was directed by John Frankenheimer; starring Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, and Ava Gardner; with the screenplay written by Rod Serling based on the novel of the same name by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II, published in September 1962.\\"Seven Days in May\\" (Kirkus Reviews, September 10, 1962) Background The book was written in late 1961 and into early 1962, during the first year of the Kennedy administration, reflecting some of the events of that era. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy accepted the resignation of vociferously anti-Communist General Edwin Walker who was indoctrinating the troops under his command with personal political opinions and had described former President Harry S. Truman, former United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and other recent still-active public figures as Communist sympathizers.\\"Armed Forces: I Must Be Free...\\" (Time Magazine, November 10, 1961) Although no longer in uniform, Walker continued to be in the news as he ran for Governor of Texas and made speeches promoting strongly right-wing views. In the film version of Seven Days in May, Fredric March, portraying the narrative's fictional President Jordan Lyman, mentions General Walker as one of the \\"false prophets\\" who were offering themselves to the public as leaders. (John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald purportedly fired rifle shots into the home of General Walker in April 1963.) As they collaborated on the novel, Knebel and Bailey, who were primarily political journalists and columnists, also conducted interviews with another controversial military commander, the newly appointed Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis LeMay, who was angry with Kennedy for refusing to provide air support for the Cuban rebels in the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Stoddard, Brooke C. \\"Seven Days in May: Remembrance of Books Past\\" (Washington Independent Review of Books, November 27, 2012)Steed, Mark S. \\"Seven Days in May by Knebel and Bailey - Book Review\\" (An Independent Head, October 26, 2013) The character of General James Mattoon Scott itself was believed to be inspired by both General Curtis LeMay and General Edwin Walker. President Kennedy had read Seven Days in May shortly after its publication and believed the scenario as described could actually occur in the United States. According to Frankenheimer in his director's commentary, production of the film received encouragement and assistance from Kennedy through White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, who conveyed to Frankenheimer Kennedy's wish that the film be produced and that, although the Pentagon did not want the film made, the President would arrange to be visiting Hyannis Port for a weekend when the film needed to shoot outside the White House.Kakutani, Michiko. Kennedy, and What Might Have Been: 'JFK's Last Hundred Days' by Thurston Clarke, page 95 (The New York Times, August 12, 2013) Plot The story is set in 1970, six years in the future at the time of the film's 1964 release, and the Cold War is still a problem (in the 1962 book, the setting was May 1974 after a stalemated war in Iran). U.S. President Jordan Lyman has recently signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, and the subsequent ratification by the U.S. Senate has produced a wave of dissatisfaction, especially among Lyman's opposition and the military, who believe the Soviets cannot be trusted. A Pentagon insider, United States Marine Corps Colonel \\"Jiggs\\" Casey (the Director of the Joint Staff), stumbles on evidence that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, led by its charismatic chairman United States Air Force General James Mattoon Scott who was a former fighter pilot, a war veteran, a flying ace, Medal of Honor recipient and an honorable patriot, intend to stage a coup d'etat to remove Lyman and his cabinet in seven days. Under the plan, a secret Army unit known as ECOMCON (Emergency COMmunications CONtrol) will seize control of the country's telephone, radio, and television networks, while Congress is prevented from implementing the treaty. Although personally opposed to Lyman's policies, Casey is appalled by the plot and alerts Lyman, who gathers a circle of trusted advisors to investigate: Secret Service White House Detail Chief Art Corwin, Treasury Secretary Christopher Todd, advisor Paul Girard, and Senator Raymond Clark of Georgia. Casey uses the pretense of a social visit to General Scott's former mistress to ferret out potential secrets that can be used against Scott, in the form of indiscreet letters he had written her. Meanwhile, the alcoholic Clark is sent to Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas, to locate the secret base, and Girard leaves for the Mediterranean to obtain a confession from Vice Admiral Barnswell, who declined to participate in the coup. Girard gets the confession in writing, but is killed when his return flight crashes, while Clark is taken captive when he reaches the secret base. However, Clark convinces the base's deputy commander, Colonel Henderson, a friend of Casey's, not to be a party to the coup and to help him escape. They reach Washington, DC, but Henderson is abducted during a moment apart from Clark and confined in a military stockade. Lyman calls Scott to the White House to demand that he and the other plotters resign. Scott denies the existence of the plot, but takes the opportunity to denounce Lyman and the treaty. Lyman argues that a coup in America would prompt the Soviets to make a preemptive strike. Scott maintains that the American people are behind him. Lyman is on the verge of confronting Scott with the letters obtained from Scott's mistress when he decides against it and allows Scott to leave. Scott meets the other three Joint Chiefs, demanding they stay in line and reminding them that Lyman does not seem to have concrete evidence of their plot. Somewhat reassured, the others agree to continue the plan to appear on television and radio simultaneously on the next day to denounce Lyman. However, Lyman first holds a press conference, at which he is prepared to announce that he has fired the four men. As Lyman is speaking, Barnswell's hand-written confession, recovered from the plane crash, is handed to him and he delays the conference for half an hour. In the interim, copies of the confession are delivered to Scott and the other plotters. As the broadcast of the press conference resumes, Scott prepares to go forward with the coup anyway, but then gives up when he hears President Lyman announce that the other three plotters have tendered their resignations. The film ends with an address by Lyman to American people on the country's future, and leaves unanswered the question of General Scott's fate.

Also, while Rod Serling's screenplay names the head of the White House Secret Service as \\"Art Corwin\\", in the film he is only referred to as \\"Art\\" or \\"Arthur\\". The surname \\"Corwin\\" was a tribute to the radio drama writer Serling described as his idol, Norman Corwin,Romano, Carlin, Inquirer book critic. \\"He Was So Outspoken About TV He Was Called Its Leading Critic in 1961. (The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 2, 1993)\\" while the given name \\"Art\\" was a nod to Serling's personal favorite, Art Carney, who played a fictionalized version of Serling in Serling's autobiographical 1959 Playhouse 90 drama, \\"The Velvet Alley\\", as well as the reincarnated Santa Claus, \\"Henry Corwin\\", in \\"The Night of the Meek\\", Serling's 1960 Christmas episode of The Twilight Zone. =Cast members whose participation has been noted in various sources= *At the 35th Academy Awards on April 8, 1963, while Seven Days in May was still in its pre-production and casting stages, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'s Victor Buono was one of the four unsuccessful nominees vying for Best Supporting Actor. His name appears on a list of actors engaged for the production, but there is no confirmation of his actual participation in the filming. *On September 17, 1963, as Seven Days in May was in initial production days, ABC showcased the premiere episode of its new TV series, The Fugitive, which prominently featured one-armed bit player Bill Raisch in the iconic, non-speaking, intermittent role of the killer. He is also listed among those who were scheduled to play a part in the filming, but whether he ultimately did has not been confirmed. Raisch was previously used by Kirk Douglas for a notorious scene in his 1960 film epic Spartacus in which, playing a Roman soldier, Raisch had a specially-fitted prosthetic arm chopped off in battle. Douglas engaged him again for a dramatic fight scene in his 1962 modern-day western Lonely Are the Brave. *Although he cannot be discerned in the release version of Seven Days in May, minor supporting actor Leonard Nimoy, who gained stardom three years later, in 1966, as Star Trek's Mr. Spock, likewise appears in the production company's casting list among the unbilled actors whose services were retained for this film.Tom. \\"Missing Cast Members\\" (The Old Movie House, February 8, 2012) Production Kirk Douglas and director John Frankenheimer were the moving forces behind the filming of Seven Days in May; the film was produced by Edward Lewis through Douglas's company Joel Productions and Seven Arts Productions. Frankenheimer wanted the screenwriter to be a partner in the production, and Rod Serling agreed to this arrangement. Douglas agreed to star in it, but he also wanted his frequent co- star Burt Lancaster to star in the film as well. Douglas enticed Lancaster to join the film by offering him the meatier role of General Scott, the film's villain, while Douglas agreed to take the role of Scott's assistant.http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/160820%7C0/Seven-Days-in- May.html Lancaster's involvement almost caused Frankenheimer to back out, since he and Lancaster had butted heads on Birdman of Alcatraz two years earlier. Only Douglas's assurances that Lancaster would behave kept the director on the project.. Ironically, Lancaster and Frankenheimer got along well during the filming, while Douglas and the director had a falling- out.Frankenheimer, John and Champlin, Charles. John Frankenheimer : A Conversation Riverwood Press, 1995. Douglas, Kirk. The Ragman's Son. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1988. Frankenheimer was also very happy with Lancaster's performance, and noted in the long scene toward the end between Lancaster and March, probably his all-time favourite directed scene, that Lancaster was \\"perfect\\" in his delivery and that no other actor could have done it better. Most of the actors in the film Frankenheimer had worked with previously, a directorial preference. Frankenheimer, in the DVD commentary for the film, stated that he would not have made the movie any differently decades later and that it was one of the films he was most satisfied with.Frankenheimer, John, Seven Days in May DVD Commentary, Warner Home Video, May 16, 2000 He saw it as a chance to \\"put a nail in the coffin of McCarthy\\". Many of Lancaster's scenes were shot later on as he was recovering from hepatitis. The filming took 51 days and according to the director the production was a happy affair, and all of the actors and crew displayed great reverence for Fredric March. Ava Gardner, whose scenes were shot in just six days, however, thought that Frankenheimer favored the other actors over her and Martin Balsam objected to his habit of shooting off pistols behind him during important scenes. Frankenheimer remarked that she was a \\"lovely person\\" and overwhelmingly beautiful, but at times \\"difficult\\" to work with. The director had formerly been in the military and had been inside the Pentagon so he didn't have to conduct much research for the film; he stated that the sets were totally authentic, praising the production designer. In addition, many of the scenes in the film were loosely based on real-life events of the Cold War to provide authenticity.Antulov, Dragan. \\"All-Reviews.com Movie/Video Review Seven Days In May\\" (All-Reviews, 2002) Supercarrier Kitty Hawk in 2002 In an early example of guerrilla filmmaking, Frankenheimer photographed Martin Balsam being ferried out to the supercarrier , berthed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego (standing in for Gibraltar), without prior Defense Department permission. Frankenheimer needed a commanding figure to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell and asked his friend, well-known producer John Houseman, to play him, to which he agreed, on condition that he have a fine bottle of wine (which is seen during the telephone scene), although he was uncredited for the role. It was Houseman's American acting debut, and he would not appear onscreen again until his Oscar-winning role in The Paper Chase (1973). Frankenheimer also wanted a shot of Kirk Douglas entering the Pentagon, but could not get permission because of security considerations, so he rigged a movie camera in a parked station wagon to photograph Douglas walking up to the Pentagon. Douglas actually received salutes from military personnel inasmuch as he was wearing the uniform of a U.S. Marine Corps colonel.Pratley, Gerald. The Cinema of John Frankenheimer London: A. Zwemmer, 1969. . Several scenes, including one with nuns in the background, were shot inside Washington Dulles International Airport which had recently been built, and the production team were the first ever to film there. The alley and car park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110 degree heat. The secret base and airstrip was specially built in the desert near Indio, California, and they borrowed an aircraft tail in one shot to make it look like a whole plane was off the picture. Originally the script had Lancaster die in a car crash at the end after hitting a bus, but finally this was edited out in favor of a small scene of him departing by taxi which was shot on a Sunday in Paris during production of The Train (1964). Getting permission near the White House was easier. Frankenheimer said that Pierre Salinger conveyed to him President Kennedy's wish that the film be made; \\"these were the days of General Walker\\" and, though the Pentagon did not want the film made, the president would conveniently arrange to visit Hyannis Port for a weekend when the film needed to shoot a staged riot outside the White House. Kirk Douglas recalled President Kennedy approving of the making of the film.Seven Days in May commentary as part of the Kirk Douglas Featured Collection at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research The director considered the scene in which Douglas's character visits the president to be a masterful scene of acting which would have been technically very difficult for most actors to sustain. He had done similar scenes on many television shows, and every camera angle and shot was extensively planned and rehearsed as was the acting in the scene by the actors. Frankenheimer paid particular attention to ensuring that the three actors in the scene were all in focus for dramatic impact. Many of Frankenheimer's signature shots were used in scenes such as this throughout the film, including his \\"depth of focus\\" shot with one or two people near the camera and another or others in the distance and the \\"low angle, wide-angle lens\\" (set at f/11) which he considered to give \\"tremendous impact\\" on a scene. Some efforts were made in the film to have the movie appear to take place in the near future, for instance the use of the then-futuristic technology of video teleconferencing, and of the use of (more exotic) foreign cars in place of (more ordinary) American cars. The film also featured the then recently issued M16 rifle. David Amram, who had previously scored Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate (1962), originally provided music for the film; however Lewis was unsatisfied with his work. Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked with the producer and Douglas on Lonely are the Brave (also 1962) and The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), was signed to rescore the project (although a brief source cue by Amram remains in the finished film). Goldsmith composed a very brief score (lasting around 15 minutes) using only pianos and percussion; he later scored Seconds (1966) and The Challenge (1982) for Frankenheimer.Scott Bettencourt, liner notes, soundtrack album, Intrada Special Collection Vol. 235 In 2013, Intrada Records released Goldsmith's music for the film on a limited edition CD (paired with Maurice Jarre's score for The Mackintosh Man - although that film was produced by Warner Bros. while Seven Days in May was theatrically released by Paramount, the entire Seven Arts Productions library was acquired by Warner Bros. in 1967 (meaning both films are now owned by WB). Alternate ending According to Douglas, an alternate ending was shot, but discarded: > General Scott, the treacherous Burt Lancaster character, goes off in his > sports car, and dies in a wreck. Was it an accident or suicide? Coming up > out of the wreckage over the car radio is President Jordan Lyman's speech > about the sanctity of the Constitution. This alternate ending echoes the novel, which ends with the apparent vehicular suicide of Senator Prentice. Reception Seven Days in May premiered on February 12, 1964, appropriately in Washington, D.C.. It opened to good critical notices and audience response. The film was nominated for two 1965 Academy Awards, for Edmond O'Brien for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration/Black-and-White for Cary Odell and Edward G. Boyle. In that year's Golden Globe Awards, O'Brien won for Best Supporting Actor, and Fredric March, John Frankenheimer and composer Jerry Goldsmith received nominations. Frankenheimer won a Danish Bodil Award for directing the Best Non-European Film and Rod Serling was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama. Evaluation in film guides Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV (1972‚Äì73 edition) gives Seven Days in May its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as \\"an exciting suspense drama concerned with politics and the problems of sanity and survival in a nuclear age\\", with the concluding sentences stating, \\"benefits from taut screenplay by Rod Serling and the direction of John Frankenheimer, which artfully builds interest leading to the finale. March is a standout in a uniformly fine cast. So many American-made films dealing with political subjects are so naive and simple-minded that the thoughtful and, in this case, the optimistic statement of the film is a welcome surprise.\\" By the 1986‚Äì87 edition, Scheuer's rating was lowered to 3¬Ω and the conclusion shortened to, \\"which artfully builds to the finale\\", with the final sentences deleted. Leonard Maltin's TV Movies & Video Guide (1989 edition) gives it a still lower 3 stars (out of 4), originally describing it as an \\"absorbing story of military scheme to overthrow the government\\", with later editions (including 2014) adding one word, \\"absorbing, believable story...\\" Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever follows Scheuer's later example, with 3¬Ω bones (out of 4), calling it a \\"topical but still gripping Cold War nuclear-peril thriller\\" and, in the end, \\"highly suspenseful, with a breathtaking climax.\\" Mick Martin's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5) finding it, as Videohound did, \\"a highly suspenseful account of an attempted military takeover...\\" and indicating that \\"the movie's tension snowballs toward a thrilling conclusion. This is one of those rare films that treat their audiences with respect.\\" Assigning the equally high rating of 4 stars (out of 5), The Motion Picture Guide begins its description with \\"a taut, gripping, and suspenseful political thriller which sports superb performances from the entire cast\\", goes to state, in the middle, that \\"proceeding to unravel its complicated plot at a rapid clip, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY is a surprisingly exciting film that also packs a grim warning\\", and ends with \\"Lancaster underplays the part of the slightly crazed general and makes him seem quite rational and persuasive. It is a frightening performance. Douglas is also quite good as the loyal aide who uncovers the fantastic plot that could destroy the entire country. March, Balsam, O'Brien, Bissell, and Houseman all turn in topnotch performances and it is through their conviction that the viewer becomes engrossed in this outlandish tale.\\" British references also show high regard for the film, with TimeOut Film Guide's founding editor Tom Milne indicating that \\"conspiracy movies may have become more darkly complex in these post-Watergate days of Pakula and paranoia, but Frankenheimer's fascination with gadgetry (in his compositions, the ubiquitous helicopters, TV screens, hidden cameras and electronic devices literally edge the human characters into insignificance) is used to create a striking visual metaphor for control by the military machine. Highly enjoyable.\\" In his Film Guide, Leslie Halliwell provided 3 stars (out of 4), describing it as an \\"absorbing political mystery drama marred only by the unnecessary introduction of a female character. Stimulating entertainment.\\" David Shipman in his 1984 The Good Film and Video Guide gives 2 (out of 4) stars, noting that it is \\"a tense political thriller whose plot is plotting\\". Remake The film was remade in 1994 by HBO as The Enemy Within with Sam Waterston as President William Foster, Jason Robards as General R. Pendleton Lloyd, and Forest Whitaker as Colonel MacKenzie 'Mac' Casey. This version followed many parts of the original plot closely, while updating it for the post‚ÄìCold War world, omitting certain incidents, and changing the ending.

Color areas are often of one unvarying color. The Hard-edge painting style is related to Geometric abstraction, Op Art, Post-painterly Abstraction, and Color Field painting. History of the term The term was coined by writer, curator and Los Angeles Times art critic Jules Langsner, along with Peter Selz, in 1959, to describe the work of painters from California, who, in their reaction to the more painterly or gestural forms of Abstract expressionism, adopted a knowingly impersonal paint application and delineated areas of color with particular sharpness and clarity. This approach to abstract painting became widespread in the 1960s, though California was its creative center. Other, earlier, movements, or styles have also contained the quality of hard-edgedness, for instance the Precisionists also displayed this quality to a great degree in their work. Hard-edge can be seen to be associated with one or more school of painting, but is also a generally descriptive term, for these qualities found in any painting. Hard-edged painting can be both figurative or nonrepresentational. In the late 1950s, Langsner and Peter Selz, then professor at the Claremont Colleges, observed a common link among the recent work of John McLaughlin (1898‚Äì1976), Lorser Feitelson (1898-1978), Karl Benjamin (1925-2012), Frederick Hammersley (1919‚Äì2009) and Feitelson's wife Helen Lundeberg (1908-1999). The group of seven gathered at the Feitelson's home to discuss a group exhibition of this nonfigurative painting style. Curated by Langsner, Four Abstract Classicists opened at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1959, then traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Exposition Park. Helen Lundeberg was not included in the exhibit. These painters were featured in a touring exhibition during 2008 called \\"The Birth of the Cool\\" in California museums along with midcentury design, music and film. =Exhibition= Four Abstract Classicists was subtitled California Hard-edge by British art critic and curator Lawrence Alloway when it traveled to England and Ireland. The term came into broader use after Alloway used it to describe contemporary American geometric abstract painting featuring \\"economy of form,\\" \\"fullness of color,\\" \\"neatness of surface,\\" and the nonrelational arrangement of forms on the canvas. In 1964, a second major hard-edge exhibition curated by Jules Langsner was held at the Pavilion Gallery in Balboa, CA (also known as the Newport Pavilion) with the cooperation of the Ankrum Gallery, Esther Robles Gallery, Felix Landau Gallery, Ferus Gallery and Heritage Gallery of Los Angeles. This was called, simply, California Hard-edge painting. Included in this show were Florence Arnold, John Barbour, Larry Bell, Karl Benjamin, John Coplans, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, John McLaughlin, and Dorothy Waldman. In 2000, Tobey C. Moss curated Four Abstract Classicists Plus One at her gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibit again featured John McLaughlin, Feitelson, Hammersley, and Benjamin, and added Lundeberg as the fifth of the original Hard-edge painters. In 2003, Louis Stern Fine Arts showed a retrospective exhibition for Lorser Feitelson entitled Lorser Feitelson and the invention of Hard-edge painting, 1945-1965. The same year, NOHO MODERN showed the works of June Harwood in an exhibition entitled June Harwood: Hard-edge painting Revisited, 1959-1969. Art critic Dave Hickey solidified the place of these 6 artists in: The Los Angeles School: Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, and John McLaughlin. The exhibition was held at the Ben Maltz Gallery of the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles in 2004-2005. The style This style of hard-edge geometric abstraction recalls the earlier work of Kasimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Theo van Doesburg, and Piet Mondrian. Other artists associated with Hard-edge painting include Herb Aach, Josef Albers, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Max Bill, Ilya Bolotowsky, Herbert Busemann, Ralph Coburn, Nassos Daphnis, Ronald Davis, Gene Davis, Robyn Denny, Howard Mehring, Burgoyne Diller, Burhan Dogancay, John Ferren, Peter Halley, Al Held, Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, G√ºnther C.

Brisbane Technical College Signwriting class, ca. 1900 An easel is an upright support used for displaying and/or fixing something resting upon it, at an angle of about 20¬∞ to the vertical. In particular, easels are traditionally used by painters to support a painting while they work on it, normally standing up, and are also sometimes used to display finished paintings. Artists' easels are still typically made of wood, in functional designs that have changed little for centuries, or even millennia, though new materials and designs are available. Easels are typically made from wood, aluminum or steel. Easel painting is a term in art history for the type of midsize painting that would have been painted on an easel, as opposed to a fresco wall painting, a large altarpiece or other piece that would have been painted resting on the floor, a small cabinet painting, or a miniature created sitting at a desk, though perhaps also on an angled support. It does not refer to the way the painting is meant to be displayed; most easel paintings are intended for display framed and hanging on a wall. In a photographic darkroom, an easel is used to keep the photographic paper in a flat or upright (horizontal, big-size enlarging) position to the enlarger. Etymology The word easel is an old Germanic synonym for donkey (compare similar semantics). In various other languages, its equivalent is the only word for both the animal and the apparatus, such as and earlier (the easel generally in full , \\"painter's donkey\\"), themselves cognates of the (ass). History Easels have been in use since the time of the ancient Egyptians. In the 1st century, Pliny the Elder made reference to a \\"large panel\\" placed upon an easel. Design Two examples of H-frame easels. There are three common designs for easels: * Tripod designs are based on three legs. Variations include: crossbars to make the easel more stable; and an independent mechanism to allow for the vertical adjustment of the working plane without sacrificing the stability of the legs of the easel. * H-Frame designs are based on right angles. All posts are generally parallel to each other with the base of the easel being rectangular. The main, front portion of the easel consists of two vertical posts with a horizontal crossbar support, giving the design the general shape of an 'H'. A variation uses additions that allow the easel's angle with respect to the ground to be adjusted. *Multiple purpose designs incorporate improved tripod and H-frame features with extra multiple adjustment capabilities that include finite rotational, horizontal and vertical adjustment of the working plane. Differences An easel can be full height, designed for standing by itself on the floor. Shorter easels can be designed for use on a table. * Artists' easels typically are fully adjustable to accommodate for different angles. Most have built-in anti-skid plates on the feet to prevent sliding. They are collapsible and overall very slim in stature to fit in small spaces around the studio. The simplest form of an artist's easel, a tripod, consists of three vertical posts joined at one end. A pivoting mechanism allows the centre-most post to pivot away from the other two, while the two non-pivoting posts have a horizontal cross member where the canvas is placed. A similar model can hold a blackboard, projection surface, placard, etc. * Paint stations are meant as more stationary consoles. These are usually equipped with various holsters, slots and supporting platforms to accommodate for buckets, brushes and canvas styles. Most of the components can be broken down for easy cleaning and storage. * Children's easels are intended to be more durable. They are typically shorter than standard easels and usually come equipped with dry erase boards and/or chalkboards attached. * Display easels are for display purposes and are meant to enhance the presentation of a painting. * Facilitation easels are for capturing audience or participant input and are meant to involve the participants with the content. * Darkroom easels keep photographic paper in a flat or upright (horizontal, big-size enlarging) position to the enlarger. Use It is most often used to hold up a painter's canvas or large sketchbook while the artist is working, or to hold a completed painting for exhibition. Here are some common uses for easels: * Studio easels are meant for use in the artist's studio with limited need for the easel to be portable. Studio easels may be simple in design or very complex, including winches, multiple masts and casters. The largest easels are studio easels, with some being able to support panels weighing over 200 pounds and measuring over 7 feet in height. * Field easels are meant to be portable for the creation of en plein air work. These easels are usually midsize or small, have telescopic or collapsible legs and are based on the tripod design. French box easels include a compartment in which to store art supplies conveniently along with a handle or straps so that the French box may be carried like a briefcase or a backpack. * Display easels are meant for the display of finished artworks. These easels tend to be very simple in design with less concern for the stability needed by a working artist. Display easels vary in size and sturdiness depending upon the weight and size of the object to be placed on them. * Facilitation easels hold large pads of paper and have trays for holding markers of varying colors * Mini easels are similar in design to display easels but scaled down to accommodate photos or flyers * Darkroom easels hold photographic paper perfectly flat during exposure. Some of these easels are designed with adjustable, overlapping, flat steel \\"blades\\" to crop the image on the paper to the desired size while keeping an unexposed white border around the image.

The corporation is the world's largest producer of newspaper (newsprint) and magazine paper, with 18 mills around the world. History Norske Skog started up in 1962 with the construction of a paper mill at Skogn in Norway, with the plant opening in 1966 and a second paper machine in 1967. Half the capital for the project was issued by the Norwegian Forest Owners Association. In 1972 Norske Skog started a cooperation with Follum Fabrikker in H√∏nefoss. By 1989 Norske Skog had acquired Follum Fabrikker and Union in Skien as well as Saugbrugsforeningen in Halden. With this Norske Skog controlled all the pulp and paper mills in Norway. The first international acquisition came in 1992 when Norske Skog Golbey in Lorraine, France. Norske Skog later bought the entire plant in 1995. Norske Skog expanded with purchases in Austria in 1996 and the Czech Republic in 1997. In 1998 Norske skog purchased mills in Thailand and the Republic of Korea. In 2000 Norske Skog bought the British Columbia based Fletcher Challenge Canada with nine mills and Pacifica Papers (formerly MacMillan Bloedel) and created NorskeCanada. It absorbed the Australian Newsprint Mills, a subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge at the same time. By 2006 Norske Skog had sold its shares in NorskeCanada and the company has changed its name to Catalyst Paper. In September 2005 it acquired the Asian company PanAsia Paper, in turn making Norske Skog Asia's largest producer of newsprint and magazine paper.

States and representations  A *-representation of a C*-algebra A on a Hilbert space H is a mapping œÄ from A into the algebra of bounded operators on H such that * œÄ is a ring homomorphism which carries involution on A into involution on operators * œÄ is nondegenerate, that is the space of vectors œÄ(x) Œæ is dense as x ranges through A and Œæ ranges through H. Note that if A has an identity, nondegeneracy means exactly œÄ is unit- preserving, i.e. œÄ maps the identity of A to the identity operator on H. A state on a C*-algebra A is a positive linear functional f of norm 1. If A has a multiplicative unit element this condition is equivalent to f(1) = 1. For a representation œÄ of a C*-algebra A on a Hilbert space H, an element Œæ is called a cyclic vector if the set of vectors :\\\\\\\\{\\\\pi(x)\\\\xi:x\\\\in A\\\\\\\\} is norm dense in H, in which case œÄ is called a cyclic representation. Any non-zero vector of an irreducible representation is cyclic. However, non-zero vectors in a cyclic representation may fail to be cyclic. =The GNS construction= Let œÄ be a *-representation of a C*-algebra A on the Hilbert space H and Œæ be a unit norm cyclic vector for œÄ. Then : a \\\\mapsto \\\\langle \\\\pi(a) \\\\xi, \\\\xi\\\\rangle is a state of A. Conversely, every state of A may be viewed as a vector state as above, under a suitable canonical representation. :Theorem.Kadison, R. V., Theorem 4.5.2, Fundamentals of the Theory of Operator Algebras, Vol. I : Elementary Theory, American Mathematical Society. Given a state œÅ of A, there is a *-representation œÄ of A acting on a Hilbert space H with distinguished unit cyclic vector Œæ such that \\\\rho(a)=\\\\langle \\\\pi(a) \\\\xi, \\\\xi \\\\rangle for every a in A. :Proof. :1) Construction of the Hilbert space H :Define on A a semi-definite sesquilinear form :: \\\\langle a, b \\\\rangle =\\\\rho(b^*a), \\\\; a, b \\\\in A. :By the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality, the degenerate elements, a in A satisfying œÅ(a* a)= 0, form a vector subspace I of A. By a C*-algebraic argument, one can show that I is a left ideal of A (known as the left kernel of œÅ). In fact, it is the largest left ideal in the null space of œÅ. The quotient space of A by the vector subspace I is an inner product space with the inner product defined by\\\\langle a+I,b+I\\\\rangle :=\\\\rho(b^*a),\\\\; a,b\\\\in A. The Cauchy completion of A/I in the norm induced by this inner product is a Hilbert space, which we denote by H. :2) Construction of the representation œÄ :Define the action œÄ of A on A/I by œÄ(a)(b+I) = ab+I of A on A/I. The same argument showing I is a left ideal also implies that œÄ(a) is a bounded operator on A/I and therefore can be extended uniquely to the completion. Unravelling the definition of the adjoint of an operator on a Hilbert space, œÄ turns out to be *-preserving. This proves the existence of a *-representation œÄ. :3) Identifying the unit norm cyclic vector Œæ :If A has a multiplicative identity 1, then it is immediate that the equivalence class Œæ in the GNS Hilbert space H containing 1 is a cyclic vector for the above representation. If A is non-unital, take an approximate identity {eŒª} for A. Since positive linear functionals are bounded, the equivalence classes of the net {eŒª} converges to some vector Œæ in H, which is a cyclic vector for œÄ. :It is clear from the definition of the inner product on the GNS Hilbert space H that the state œÅ can be recovered as a vector state on H. This proves the theorem. The method used to produce a *-representation from a state of A in the proof of the above theorem is called the GNS construction. For a state of a C*-algebra A, the corresponding GNS representation is essentially uniquely determined by the condition, \\\\rho(a) = \\\\langle \\\\pi(a) \\\\xi, \\\\xi \\\\rangle as seen in the theorem below. :Theorem.Kadison, R. V., Proposition 4.5.3, Fundamentals of the Theory of Operator Algebras, Vol. I : Elementary Theory, American Mathematical Society. Given a state œÅ of A, let œÄ, œÄ' be *-representations of A on Hilbert spaces H, H' respectively each with unit norm cyclic vectors Œæ ‚àà H, Œæ' ‚àà H' such that \\\\rho(a) = \\\\langle \\\\pi(a) \\\\xi, \\\\xi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\pi'(a) \\\\xi ', \\\\xi ' \\\\rangle for all a \\\\in A. Then œÄ, œÄ' are unitarily equivalent *-representations i.e. there is a unitary operator U from H to H' such that œÄ'(a) = UœÄ(a)U* for all a in A. The operator U that implements the unitary equivalence maps œÄ(a)Œæ to œÄ'(a)Œæ' for all a in A. =Significance of the GNS construction= The GNS construction is at the heart of the proof of the Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark theorem characterizing C*-algebras as algebras of operators. A C*-algebra has sufficiently many pure states (see below) so that the direct sum of corresponding irreducible GNS representations is faithful. The direct sum of the corresponding GNS representations of all states is called the universal representation of A. The universal representation of A contains every cyclic representation. As every *-representation is a direct sum of cyclic representations, it follows that every *-representation of A is a direct summand of some sum of copies of the universal representation. If Œ¶ is the universal representation of a C*-algebra A, the closure of Œ¶(A) in the weak operator topology is called the enveloping von Neumann algebra of A. It can be identified with the double dual A**.  Irreducibility  Also of significance is the relation between irreducible *-representations and extreme points of the convex set of states. A representation œÄ on H is irreducible if and only if there are no closed subspaces of H which are invariant under all the operators œÄ(x) other than H itself and the trivial subspace {0}. :Theorem. The set of states of a C*-algebra A with a unit element is a compact convex set under the weak-* topology. In general, (regardless of whether or not A has a unit element) the set of positive functionals of norm ‚â§ 1 is a compact convex set. Both of these results follow immediately from the Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem. In the unital commutative case, for the C*-algebra C(X) of continuous functions on some compact X, Riesz‚ÄìMarkov‚ÄìKakutani representation theorem says that the positive functionals of norm ‚â§ 1 are precisely the Borel positive measures on X with total mass ‚â§ 1. It follows from Krein‚ÄìMilman theorem that the extremal states are the Dirac point-mass measures. On the other hand, a representation of C(X) is irreducible if and only if it is one-dimensional. Therefore, the GNS representation of C(X) corresponding to a measure Œº is irreducible if and only if Œº is an extremal state. This is in fact true for C*-algebras in general. :Theorem. Let A be a C*-algebra. If œÄ is a *-representation of A on the Hilbert space H with unit norm cyclic vector Œæ, then œÄ is irreducible if and only if the corresponding state f is an extreme point of the convex set of positive linear functionals on A of norm ‚â§ 1. To prove this result one notes first that a representation is irreducible if and only if the commutant of œÄ(A), denoted by œÄ(A)', consists of scalar multiples of the identity. Any positive linear functionals g on A dominated by f is of the form : g(x^*x) = \\\\langle \\\\pi(x) \\\\xi, \\\\pi(x) T_g \\\\, \\\\xi \\\\rangle for some positive operator Tg in œÄ(A)' with 0 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 1 in the operator order. This is a version of the Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem. For such g, one can write f as a sum of positive linear functionals: f = g + g' . So œÄ is unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of œÄg ‚äï œÄg' . This shows that œÄ is irreducible if and only if any such œÄg is unitarily equivalent to œÄ, i.e. g is a scalar multiple of f, which proves the theorem. Extremal states are usually called pure states. Note that a state is a pure state if and only if it is extremal in the convex set of states. The theorems above for C*-algebras are valid more generally in the context of B*-algebras with approximate identity.  Generalizations  The Stinespring factorization theorem characterizing completely positive maps is an important generalization of the GNS construction.  History  Gelfand and Naimark's paper on the Gelfand‚ÄìNaimark theorem was published in 1943. (also Google Books, see pp. 3‚Äì20) Segal recognized the construction that was implicit in this work and presented it in sharpened form.Richard V. Kadison: Notes on the Gelfand‚ÄìNeimark theorem. In: Robert C. Doran (ed.): C*-Algebras: 1943‚Äì1993. A Fifty Year Celebration, AMS special session commemorating the first fifty years of C*-algebra theory, January 13‚Äì14, 1993, San Antonio, Texas, American Mathematical Society, pp. 21‚Äì54, (available from Google Books, see pp. 21 ff.) In his paper of 1947 Segal showed that it is sufficient, for any physical system that can be described by an algebra of operators on a Hilbert space, to consider the irreducible representations of a C*-algebra. In quantum theory this means that the C*-algebra is generated by the observables. This, as Segal pointed out, had been shown earlier by John von Neumann only for the specific case of the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger-Heisenberg theory.

He is primarily remembered for being suspected of assisting in the downfall of King Richard's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (1355‚Äì1397) (youngest son of King Edward III) and then for conspiring against King Richard's first cousin and eventual deposer, Henry Bolingbroke, later King Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413). Origins He was the third son of Thomas Holland by his wife Joan of Kent, \\"The Fair Maid of Kent\\". Joan was daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, a son of King Edward I (1272‚Äì1307), and Thomas would be made Earl of Kent, in what is considered a new creation, as husband of Joan, in whom the former Earldom was vested as eventual heiress of Edmund of Woodstock. Joan later married Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son and heir apparent of her first cousin King Edward III, by whom she had a son King Richard II, who was thus a half-brother of John Holland. Political career The great hall at Dartington, built by the 1st Duke of Exeter Interior of the great hall at Dartington (restored 20th.c) Early in King Richard's reign, Holland was made a Knight of the Garter (1381). He was also part of the escort that accompanied the queen-to-be, Anne of Bohemia, on her trip to England. Holland had a violent temper, which got him in trouble several times. The most famous incident occurred during Richard II's 1385 expedition to Scotland. An archer in the service of Ralph Stafford, eldest son of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, killed one of Holland's esquires. Stafford went to find Holland to apologize, but Holland killed him as soon as he identified himself. King Richard thereupon ordered the forfeiture of Holland's lands. The mother of both Holland and Richard II, Joan of Kent, died shortly afterwards, it was said of grief at the quarrel between her sons. Early in 1386 Holland reconciled with the Staffords, and had his property restored. Later in 1386 he married Elizabeth of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (younger brother of the Black Prince), by his wife Blanche of Lancaster. He and Elizabeth then went on Gaunt's expedition to Spain, where Holland was appointed constable of the English army. After his return to England, on 2 June 1388 Holland was created Earl of Huntingdon, by Act of Parliament. In 1389 he was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain for life, Admiral of the Fleet in the Western Seas, and constable of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall. During this time he also received large grants of land from King Richard. Over the next few years he held a number of additional offices: Constable of Conway Castle (1394); Governor of Carlisle Castle (1395); Warden (1398) later Constable-General, of the West Marches towards Scotland. His military service was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1394. In 1397 Holland had marched with King Richard to arrest the latter's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, and Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and later seized and held Arundel Castle at the king's request. As a reward, on 29 September 1397 he was created Duke of Exeter. In 1399 he accompanied King Richard on his expedition to Ireland. Following their return the king sent him to try to negotiate with his own first cousin and Holland's brother-in-law Henry Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt. After Bolingbroke deposed Richard in 1399 and took the throne as King Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413), he called to account those who had been involved in the arrest and downfall of his uncle Thomas of Woodstock, and confiscated all rewards and titles received by them from King Richard. Thus Holland was stripped of his dukedom, becoming again merely Earl of Huntingdon. Early in 1400 Holland entered into a conspiracy, known as the Epiphany Rising, with his nephew Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent, and with Thomas le Despencer, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and others. Their aim was to assassinate King Henry and his sons, and to return Richard, then in prison, to the throne. The plot failed and Holland fled, but was caught, near Pleshey Castle in Essex, and executed on 16 January 1400. Among those who witnessed the execution was Arundel's son, Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel. Holland's lands and titles were forfeited, but eventually they were restored to his second son John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. Marriage and issue In 1386 he married Elizabeth of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (younger brother of the Black Prince) by his wife Blanche of Lancaster, by whom he had children including: =Sons= * Richard Holland (died 3 September 1400), eldest son and heir, who survived his father only 7 months *John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon (1395‚Äì1447), second son, to whom in 1416 (after the death of his elder brother) was restored his father's dukedom. *Sir Edward Holland (c. 1399 ‚Äì after 1413) =Daughters= *Constance Holland (1387‚Äì1437), married first Thomas Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, married second Sir John Grey, KG *Elizabeth Holland (c. 1389 ‚Äì 1449) *Alice Holland (c. 1392 ‚Äì c. 1406), married Richard de Vere, 11th Earl of Oxford Death He was executed on 16 January 1400, following the failure of the Epiphany Rising conspiracy against King Henry IV. His body was buried at the collegiate church in Pleshey. His tomb remained until the late 16th century, when, along with many other tombs in the church, it was broken up for use as building material.

The crisis eventually spread to the national level, becoming one of the key issues in the federal election of 1896 and resulted in the defeat of the Conservative government, which had been in power for most of the previous thirty years. Because of the close linkage at that time between religion and language, the Schools Question raised the deeper question whether French would survive as a language or a culture in Western Canada. The result of the crisis was that by the end of the 19th century, French was no longer supported as an official language in Manitoba or the neighbouring North-West Territories, which in turn led to a strengthening of French-Canadian nationalism in Quebec.  Foundation of Manitoba (1870)  Manitoba became the first western province to join Confederation in 1870. The province was created through negotiations between Canada and the provisional Red River government of Louis Riel, following the Red River Resistance. One of the key issues in the negotiations was the question of control of education in the new province. There was considerable pressure for a system of denominational schools in the new province, for both Protestants and Roman Catholics. Although framed as a religious issue, there was also a question of language politics involved, since at that time, most Protestants in Manitoba were anglophones and most Roman Catholics were francophones. Religious control over education thus also related to the language of education. The Act of Parliament which created the province, the Manitoba Act, responded to these concerns by giving the province the power to pass laws relating to education, but also by giving constitutional protection to denominational school rights which existed \\"...by Law or practice in the Province at the Union.\\"Manitoba Act, 1870 , s. 22. The exact meaning of this provision, and the scope of the constitutional protection it provided, subsequently became a matter of considerable political and legal debate.  Political and demographic developments (1870-1890)  Soon before the Manitoba Act was passed to create the province, settlers from English Canada, mainly Ontario, began to arrive in greater numbers than they had come prior to the Red River Rebellion (which was, in part, a reaction against them). The Manitoba Act had given equal rights to Protestant and Roman Catholic schools, but by the 1880s this no longer reflected the linguistic makeup of the province. Many M√©tis had left,Gerhard Ens, Homeland to Hinterland: The Changing Worlds of the Red River Metis in the Nineteenth Century (Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1996) and settlers from Quebec were not as numerous as those from Ontario. As the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1886, many more English-speaking settlers had begun to arrive.  Manitoba's 1890 Legislation  = The Manitoba Public Schools Act, 1890 = Following the establishment of the Province, the new provincial government established a system of denominational schools funded by provincial taxes. However, in 1890, the Manitoba government of Premier Thomas Greenway passed the Public Schools Act,Public Schools Act, S.M. 1890, c. 38. removing funding for Catholic and Protestant denominational schools and establishing a system of tax-supported, non-sectarian public schools. The question was whether this legislation was consistent with s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act. Two rounds of litigation were the result, in each case going to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court in the British Empire. The legislation also triggered considerable national political debate. = Abolition of French as an Official Language = The Manitoba Act of 1870 had provided that English and French be co-official languages in the newly created Province of Manitoba (which initially included only the region surrounding Lake Manitoba).Manitoba Act, 1870 , s. 23. However, in 1890, at the same time as the enactment of the Public Schools Act, the Manitoba Legislature passed another Act which made English the only official language in the Province.An Act to Provide that the English Language shall be the Official Language of the Province of Manitoba, S.M. 1890, c. 14. Although this Act did not directly relate to the education issue, it provided further controversy on the language issue. Two years later, in 1892, the neighbouring Northwest Territories (which at the time covered the Canadian Prairies west and northwest of Manitoba) also abolished French as an official language. Although the abolition of French as an official language did not directly affect the Schools Question, it strengthened the controversy, given the ties between religious schools and the language of education.  First Court Case: Winnipeg v. Barrett, 1892  The first court case focussed on whether the Public Schools Act conflicted with the constitutional protection for denominational schools set out in s. 22 of the Manitoba Act, 1870. Catholics in Manitoba, encouraged by the federal government of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, challenged the constitutionality of the 1890 Act in the Queen's Bench of Manitoba, arguing that the requirement to pay taxes to the new public school interfered with their rights under s. 22. The Manitoba Queen's Bench held that the new Public Schools Act was valid.Barrett v. City of Winnipeg (1891), 7 Man. L.R. 273 (Q.B.); application dismissed by a single judge in chambers (Killam J.), at p. 282; appeal to the Queen's Bench en banc dismissed and statute upheld, at p. 308. The challengers then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which allowed the appeal and held that the 1890 Act conflicted with s. 22 of the Manitoba Act.Barrett v. Winnipeg (1891), 19 S.C.R. 374. Based on the Supreme Court decision, another action was brought in the Manitoba Queen's Bench, which followed the Supreme Court decision and quashed a school tax assessment under the 1890 Act.Logan v. City of Winnipeg (1891), 8 Man. L.R. 3 (Q.B.). The City of Winnipeg then appealed both cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain which overruled the Supreme Court and held that the 1890 Act was consistent with the Manitoba Act.City of Winnipeg v. Barrett; City of Winnipeg v. Logan, [1892] A.C. 445 (P.C.). The exact point in dispute was the meaning of the phrase \\"...by Law or practice in the Province at the Union,\\" used in s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act. The Judicial Committee held that this provision did not itself create a system of denominational schools. Rather, it gave constitutional protection to whatever rights existed with respect to denominational schools in Manitoba in 1870. The Judicial Committee reviewed the historical record and concluded that in 1870, all schools in Manitoba were funded by the religious groups which ran them, and not by any system of public taxation. As a result, the Judicial Committee concluded that s. 22(1) simply guaranteed the right of religious groups to establish and run their own schools, at their own expense. It did not guarantee any public funding for denominational schools, since there was no financial tax support for denominational schools in 1870. Taxpayer funding for denominational schools was only established after the foundation of the Province and was not guaranteed by s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act, 1870. The Legislature therefore could end taxpayer funding for denominational schools and instead establishing a system of taxpayer funded non-sectarian schools, without being in breach of s. 22(1).  Second Court Case: Brophy v. Manitoba, 1894  Although education is normally a matter of exclusive provincial jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada, there is a special power for the federal government in relation to separate schools. Section 93(3) of the Constitution Act, 1867 provides that there is an appeal to the Governor General in Council \\"...from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen's Subjects in relation to Education.\\" Section 93(4) provides that if a province does not comply with a decision of the Governor-in-Council in an appeal under s. 93(3), then Parliament has the power to enact \\"... remedial Laws for the due Execution of the Provisions of this Section and of any Decision of the Governor General in Council under this Section.\\"Constitution Act, 1867, s. 93(3),(4). Section 22 of the Manitoba Act had similar provisions authorising an appeal to the Governor General in Council and remedial legislation by Parliament.Manitoba Act, s. 22(2), (3). Following the Privy Council decision in Barrett, pressure arose for the federal government to take action under these provisions. However, it was not clear if the changes to the Manitoba school system set out by the 1890 Act were sufficient to authorise the federal government to hear an appeal and to enact remedial legislation, in light of the Privy Council's conclusion that the system of taxpayer funded denominational schools which were established in the early 1870s was not constitutionally protected. To resolve this uncertainty, the federal government referred the matter to the Supreme Court of Canada as a reference question, asking if these constitutional provisions applied. The Supreme Court held that those provisions did not apply, since the post-1870 denominational schools were not constitutionally protected. This decision was appealed to the Privy Council, which overturned the Supreme Court. The Privy Council held that when the Province had created a system of taxpayer funded denominational schools in the early 1870s, it had given a \\"right or privilege\\" to the Protestants and Roman Catholics in relation to education. Although that \\"right or privilege\\" was not constitutionally entrenched by s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act, the abolition of the denominational schools could be appealed to the federal government under s. 22(2) of the Manitoba Act, and Parliament could enact remedial legislation under s. 22(3).Brophy v. Attorney General of Manitoba, [1895] A.C. 202 (P.C.).  Political Crisis in the Federal Government (1894 - 1896)  The \\"Schools Question\\", as it was known, had divided the Conservative government since 1890, and especially after Macdonald's death in 1891 when no strong leader replaced him. However, so long as education remained an exclusively provincial jurisdiction, the federal government had limited powers to intervene. In light of the Privy Council decision in Brophy v. Manitoba, the political situation changed. The federal government now had the authority to act; the question was whether it would. In 1896, the federal government of Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell introduced remedial legislation under s. 22(3) of the Manitoba Act, 1870 in the House of Commons. However, the draft legislation was very unpopular with some members of the Conservative caucus, and its introduction triggered a political crisis. Faced with a caucus revolt, Prime Minister Bowell was forced to call an election and to resign in April of that year. Following the election call, with the remedial bill not passed by Parliament, Charles Tupper became Prime Minister and led the Conservatives in the election. The election of 1896 was centred on the Schools Question. It especially divided Conservatives in Quebec and Ontario; French Catholic Quebecers were offended that French was being eliminated in Manitoba as an official language, while Ontario saw opposition to Catholic support by the strong Orange Order. The Liberals, under Wilfrid Laurier (a French Catholic), took advantage of the division in the Conservative party. Laurier won the election and became Prime Minister.  Laurier's Manitoba Compromise  Laurier developed a compromise with Thomas Greenway, Premier of Manitoba. They agreed that Catholic education would be permitted in public schools, and French would be used in teaching, but only on a school-by-school basis requiring there to be a minimum of 10 French speaking pupils. They also re-established a Catholic school board, but without government funding. Many Catholics were still opposed to this compromise, and even appealed to Pope Leo XIII. The Pope sent an observer, who concluded, like Laurier, that the compromise was the fairest one possible with so few Catholics left in the province.  Consequences of the controversy  As French was no longer an official language, its use declined greatly. By 1916, the guarantee of French instruction was removed from the compromise, leaving English as the only official language in use in the province until 1985. The Schools Question, along with the execution of Louis Riel in 1885, was one of the incidents that led to strengthening of French Canadian nationalism in Quebec in the late 19th century.

A onetime top prospect of the Chicago Cubs, he pitched for the team from 2002 to 2006 in a career that was marred by injuries. In his prime, his repertoire of pitches included a mid-90s mph fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. He is currently the pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Born and raised in San Diego, California, Prior engaged Tom House as his pitching tutor in high school. A career at the University of Southern California, where he won the Golden Spikes Award, saw him become one of the top prospects in the 2001 MLB draft, when he was the second overall pick by the Cubs. He made only six appearances in the minor leagues before debuting with the team in 2002. In 2003, he finished third in National League (NL) Cy Young Award voting, ranking among the leaders with 18 wins, a 2.43 earned run average (ERA), and 245 strikeouts. Helping the Cubs win the NL Central title, he outpitched Greg Maddux in the NL Division Series and won Game 2 of the NL Championship Series, but he was on the mound for Game 6 when Steve Bartman prevented Mois√©s Alou from catching a foul ball. Throwing a scoreless game up to that point, Prior experienced a subsequent loss of control and was charged with the loss, as the Florida Marlins went on to win the series in seven games. In 2004, he was on the disabled list twice but finished the season with a 16-strikeout performance against the Cincinnati Reds. He made 27 starts with the Cubs in 2005 and finished ninth in the NL in strikeouts despite missing some time due to injury. Multiple injuries limited him to nine games in 2006, and he did not pitch at all in 2007 due to tears in his labrum, anterior capsule, and rotator cuff. After the season, the Cubs non-tendered him, letting him become a free agent. Prior never pitched in the major leagues again after that, though he tried several times. He pitched in the minor leagues for multiple organizations over the next six years before finally retiring at the end of the 2013 season. Once touted as having perfect \\"pitching\\" mechanics by The Sporting News, his \\"Inverted W\\" arm action has been discussed as a possible reason for his lack of durability, as well as Dusty Baker's heavy usage of him during the 2003 season, though Prior himself does not blame Baker for his injuries. Prior accepted a front office position with the San Diego Padres in 2013, then joined the Dodgers, becoming their pitching coach in 2020. Amateur career Born September 7, 1980, in San Diego, California, Prior was part of an athletic family. Jerry, his father, played college football for Vanderbilt University, and both of Mark's older siblings played sports as well. \\"Being the youngest of three kids, there's no room for me to step out of line,\\" he quipped. Growing up, Prior attended the University of San Diego High School. As a sophomore, he worked with former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Tom House, who had a business of tutoring young pitchers. Using computer analysis to try to determine the ideal pitching motion, House worked with Prior on his delivery and prescribed a detailed workout regimen which the pitcher would continue to utilize as his career advanced. He was originally drafted by the New York Yankees in the first round of the 1998 amateur draft and offered an approximately $1.5 million signing bonus, but the parties were unable to agree on a contract after negotiating all summer, and Prior chose to attend college instead, pursuing a business degree while playing college baseball. As a freshman, Prior went to Vanderbilt. His coach with the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tim Corbin, later listed him among the best pitchers he had ever coached. He then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), posting a 10‚Äì7 record his sophomore year and leading the USC Trojans to the 2000 College World Series. USC posted a 16‚Äìgame winning streak before Prior helped USC reach the College World Series again in 2001, posting a 15‚Äì1 record and a 1.69 earned run average (ERA), striking out 202 in innings while walking just 18. He won several awards that year, including the Dick Howser Trophy, the Golden Spikes Award, and the Rotary Smith Award. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= In 2001, Prior re-entered the draft and was considered \\"the consensus top player,\\" according to ESPN. He was taken second overall by the Chicago Cubs, behind Joe Mauer, who was drafted by the Minnesota Twins. The Cubs signed Prior to a contract for $10.5 million, the highest signing bonus for a draft pick until the Washington Nationals gave Stephen Strasburg $15 million in 2009. After nine starts in the minors, Prior was called-up to the big leagues in 2002 as a 21-year-old. He made his Major League debut on May 22 at Wrigley Field against the Pittsburgh Pirates and became one of 14 Cub pitchers since 1920 to win his first major league start by striking out 10 batters over six innings pitched in a 7-4 victory. Teammate Sammy Sosa said, \\"I was impressed with what he did today. Going out there in front of 40,000 people and throwing the way he did, that was a good sign.\\" On June 7, he threw 128 pitches and struck out 11 while allowing no runs in a 2‚Äì0 win over the Seattle Mariners. He threw his first career complete game on August 4, striking out 13, allowing one run, and throwing 136 pitches in a 4‚Äì1 win over the Colorado Rockies. \\"I was kind of surprised that they did send me out there,\\" he said, when he found out he was pitching the ninth. On August 15, he struck out seven hitters in a row, tying the Cubs' record shared by Jamie Moyer and Kerry Wood. In total, he struck out 12 in six innings, earning a no decision in an eventual 6‚Äì4 win. During a game against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 31, he was removed because of a strained left hamstring. Two days later, the Cubs announced they were shutting him down for the rest of the year because of the injury. Prior finished his rookie campaign with a 6-6 record with a 3.32 ERA, and 147 strikeouts in innings pitched. The Sporting News called his rookie season \\"stellar,\\" and he finished seventh in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award voting. In his second start of the 2003 season, Prior pitched his first career shutout, striking out 12 and allowing four hits in a 3‚Äì0 win over the Montreal Expos. In six innings on May 12, he allowed four runs to the Milwaukee Brewers but struck out 11 and earned the victory in an 11‚Äì5 triumph. He struck out 16 Brewers on June 26, allowing two runs in eight innings but getting a no decision in a 5‚Äì3 loss. In the second inning of a game against the Atlanta Braves on July 11, Prior had to exit after suffering a violent on- field collision with Atlanta second baseman Marcus Giles. The injury forced him to the disabled list (DL) with shoulder stiffness. Selected as National League All-Stars in 2003, both Prior and fellow right-handed pitcher Kerry Wood were dubbed \\"Chicago Heat\\" by Sports Illustrated. Sportswriter George Vecsey compared them to other famed rotation twosomes, like Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette, or Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. According to CBS Local, sportswriters and fans criticized Cubs manager Dusty Baker on the high pitch counts of the two aces. Prior averaged 113.4 pitches per starts in the regular season, that number rising to 126.1 in September and 122.7 in the playoffs. However, the contributions of the two aces helped lead the Cubs to an 88-win season and an NL Central division title. Against his hometown San Diego Padres on August 5, Prior returned from the DL, allowing two hits and no runs in six inning and earning the victory in a 3‚Äì0 win. After his return, he compiled a 10‚Äì1 record, striking out 13, 14, and 10 in his final three starts of the season. On September 27, he gave up two runs and struck out 10 in innings, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates for the win in Game 1 of a doubleheader. That win brought the Cubs' magic number to one for the division title, and they won the second game to reach the playoffs for the first time since 1989. Tied for the second most wins as a NL pitcher with Woody Williams in 2003, Prior finished third in NL Cy Young Award voting after compiling an 18‚Äì6 win-loss record. His 2.43 ERA was third in the NL (behind Jason Schmidt's 2.34 and Kevin Brown's 2.39), his 245 strikeouts were topped only by Wood's 266, and his .750 winning percentage was tied with three others for second in the NL behind Schmidt's .773. In the NL Division Series, the Cubs faced Atlanta, and Prior started Game 3 against former Cub Greg Maddux. Prior allowed two hits and one run, throwing a complete game and striking out seven as the Cubs won 3‚Äì1. With a five-game series win over the Braves, the Cubs faced the Florida Marlins in the NL Championship Series. Prior pitched into the eighth inning in Game 2, allowing three runs (two earned) and striking out five in a 12‚Äì3 victory, before taking the mound again in Game 6. For seven innings, he threw scoreless ball, allowing just three hits as the Cubs took a 3‚Äì0 lead. When Mike Mordecai flew out against him to start the eighth, the Cubs were five outs away from playing in their first World Series since 1945. Then, Juan Pierre hit a double, bringing up Luis Castillo, who hit a foul ball down the left field line that outfielder Mois√©s Alou gave chase to. The ball came down at the edge of the stands, and Steve Bartman, a fan, reached for it, preventing Alou from making the catch. Castillo went on to walk, and Prior and the Cubs never recovered from the incident. Prior struggled with his command and gave up the lead with the aid of poor defensive play, most notably a booted ground ball by shortstop Alex Gonzalez that might have resulted in a double play. After Derrek Lee hit an RBI double off him that tied the game and put runners at second and third, Prior was removed from the game and replaced with Kyle Farnsworth. The Marlins went on to score eight runs that inning, and Prior was charged with the loss in the 8-3 defeat. The Cubs went on to lose Game 7, and their 94-year-long World Series drought continued. Prior was forced to miss the first two months of the 2004 season due to an achilles tendon injury and elbow soreness. In his return on June 4, he struck out eight Pirates, allowing two hits and no runs in six innings, though the Cubs lost 2‚Äì1. His ERA went up to 5.05 after he gave up seven runs over three innings in an 8‚Äì6 loss to San Diego on August 10, and Ramon Hernandez of the Padres noticed a difference. \\"When I faced Prior the first time in my life he was throwing 96, 97. Today he was throwing 91-94 and he was a little wild and out of the zone. He was hurt for a long time. It might take a little bit of time for him to be the Prior that everybody has seen.\\" Prior posted a 3.06 ERA after that, and in his last three games of the season, he allowed just two runs in innings. He tied a career-high by striking out 16 Cincinnati Reds over nine innings in his \\"best game of the season\\" according to ESPN, though the Cubs went on to lose 2‚Äì1 in the 12th inning. Prior finished 2004 with a 6-4 record and a 4.02 ERA in 21 starts, striking out 139 in innings. Elbow inflammation caused Prior to start the 2005 season on the disabled list, though he was activated on April 12. He won his first three starts and posted a 2.93 ERA through May 27. However, against the Rockies that day, Prior was hit on his right (pitching) elbow by a 117-mph comeback line drive off the bat of Brad Hawpe, giving him a compression fracture. This sent him to another stint on the DL. Coincidentally, Hawpe had hit a three-run home run off Prior in the 2000 College World Series while playing for the Louisiana State University Tigers. Returning from the DL on June 26, Prior limited the Chicago White Sox to one hit in six innings, earning the win in a 2‚Äì0 triumph. He remained in the team's rotation the rest of the year, not having to miss time with any other injuries. Against the Pirates on July 14, he allowed two hits and one unearned run in eight innings, earning the win in a 5‚Äì1 victory. Prior finished the 2005 season with an 11‚Äì7 record in 27 starts, striking out 188 in innings. His 188 strikeouts were the ninth-most in the NL, despite his time missed due to injury. During the 2005 off-season, after Nomar Garciaparra left the Cubs via free agency, Prior was mentioned by Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports as part of a possible deal for Baltimore Orioles's shortstop Miguel Tejada, but this trade did not come to pass. As in 2005, Prior started the 2006 season on the disabled list. This time, though, it was because of a strained right shoulder, and the injury caused him to miss the first two months of the 2006 season. His debut came on June 18, when he had what ESPN called \\"one of the worst outings of his career\\" against the Detroit Tigers, giving up six runs in the first inning and lasting just innings before being pulled. Prior was 0‚Äì4 in four starts with a 7.71 ERA, until he was once again put on the disabled list on July 14, after straining his left oblique muscle while taking batting practice on July 8. Since he had not pitched since July 4, he was eligible to return on July 21 against the Nationals. He pitched only innings before he was pulled out of the game, allowing four runs and taking a no decision in an eventual 7‚Äì6 loss. Against the Brewers on August 10, Prior's pitch speed slowed in the third inning of his start. He was replaced by Juan Mateo in the fourth inning, having allowed six runs (five earned) in an eventual 8‚Äì6 defeat. Two days later, he was placed on the disabled list (tendinitis) for the third time that season, missing the remainder of the year. He finished the 2006 season with a 1‚Äì6 record and a 7.22 ERA in nine starts, striking out 38 against 28 walks in innings. Eligible for arbitration, Prior asked for a pay raise from his 2006 salary of $3.65 million to $3.875 million for 2007. The Cubs avoided arbitration with Prior when he settled for a one-year $3.575 million contract for 2007. Prior found himself competing with Wade Miller to be the Cubs' fifth starter in 2007, and he was optioned to the minor leagues before the season began. After one start in the minors, in which he gave up three runs and got the win, Prior received exploratory surgery on his right shoulder by James Andrews, a noted orthopedic surgeon; the procedure showed evidence of vast structural damage. There were tears in Prior's labrum, anterior capsule, and rotator cuff. As a result, Prior missed the rest of the 2007 season. Cubs general manager (GM) Jim Hendry said that anything provided by Prior or Wood would be \\"gravy\\" and he hoped that this would come to fruition. The Associated Press reported that the injury was not expected to be career-ending. Prior was non-tendered on December 12, 2007, ending his tenure with the Cubs. =Other organizations, comeback attempts= San Diego Padres (2008-09) On December 26, 2007, Prior agreed to a $1 million, one- year, incentive-laden contract with the San Diego Padres. Prior had hoped to pitch again by May or June of the 2008 season, but another tear of his right anterior capsule during his rehab in May 2008 required surgery on June 4 that forced him to miss his second consecutive season. On January 13, 2009, Prior agreed to another one-year contract with the Padres, this one a minor league deal, which included a $1 million option if Prior pitched in the major leagues in 2009. He was released from his contract on August 1, 2009, after the team was disappointed by a lack of progress in his rehab. Orange County Flyers (independent), Texas Rangers (2010) By November of 2009, throwing a ball 30 feet resulted in pain for Prior. That month, he hired Jackson Crowther, a former minor league pitcher who had also attended USC, to help him with his rehab. They focused on trying to grow muscle groups in the shoulder region, in hopes of helping stabilize the joint. On June 30, 2010, Prior returned to USC to perform a workout for major league scouts, but the workout was judged as \\"just all right\\" by an unnamed veteran scout. Unable to sign with a major league team, Prior agreed to an independent league contract with the Orange County Flyers of the Golden Baseball League on August 3, 2010. Used out of the bullpen for the team, he posted an 0.82 ERA in nine games, striking out 22 hitters in 11 innings. On September 3, he signed with the Texas Rangers on a minor league contract. He pitched one scoreless inning for their Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City RedHawks. New York Yankees (2011) Prior signed a one-year minor league contract with the New York Yankees for the 2011 season, though he was an unlikely candidate to make the Yankees' roster because their only projected vacancy was for a long reliever. Prior was assigned to start the year with the Single-A advanced Tampa Yankees in Florida rather than joining the colder weather Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in order to work on his transition to a relief pitcher. After just four games, he was promoted to Scranton on April 20 but promptly placed on the disabled list with a groin injury. Ultimately, Prior would make 11 appearances in the minor leagues for the Yankees, only one of which was at Triple-A. He was granted free agency on November 2, 2011. Boston Red Sox (2012) Unsigned to begin the 2012 season, Prior secured a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on May 2 and pitched in their extended spring training program. Later joining the Pawtucket Red Sox, he provided the Triple-A team with \\"stellar\\" pitching, according to Teddy Mitrosilis of ESPN, though he was walking too many hitters. In 19 games for Pawtucket (all in relief), Prior had a 1‚Äì0 record, a 3.96 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in 25 innings, though he walked 23. He was released by the Red Sox on August 17 in order to make room for a newly-acquired prospect on the roster. Cincinnati Reds (2013) In February of 2013, Prior called Baker, now manager of the Reds, to see if Cincinnati was interested in signing him. The Reds gave him a physical, and when he passed, they signed him to a minor league contract on March 1, 2013. He made seven appearances for the Triple-A Louisville Bats but was placed on the disabled list in April with a shoulder injury. On June 28, the Reds released Prior. He announced his retirement from baseball in December. Pitching style Prior pitching for the Cubs at Wrigley Field on July 30, 2004 In his prime, Prior's repertoire of pitches included a mid-90s mph fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. The fastball reached speeds of up to 97 miles per hour, at its fastest, while the curve featured a sharp, downward break, travelling about 10 miles per hour slower. Teammate Wood praised his fearlessness and control: \\"\\"He's not worried about throwing an inside fastball to a Jeff Bagwell with men on second and third...If that's the pitch he needs to make, he'll make it.\\" Damien Miller, his catcher with the Cubs in 2003, compared him to Curt Schilling, noting that both pitchers threw a lot of high fastballs. Daniel Habib of Sports Illustrated called him \\"fundamentally sound,\\" also praising his \\"sophisticated approach\\" to hitters. Early in Prior's career, his pitching mechanics were touted as \\"perfect,\\" according to The Sporting News. House tried to help him develop a mechanically efficient and sound delivery. Sports reporter Buster Olney called his mechanics \\"smooth, fluid, consistent,\\" opining that his delivery made him less of an injury-risk than teammate Wood. House said that same year, \\"He's up there with Nolan Ryan...he has better mechanics than Roger Clemens, if only by percentage points. He has Greg Maddux mechanics with a Kerry Wood/Nolan Ryan type of arm. He's going to, with maturity, get bigger and stronger, too. It's a gene-pool thing.\\" House also labelled Prior a \\"can't-miss\\" prospect. However, after Prior's rash of injuries, people reexamined his delivery. His throwing motion drew criticism from \\"armchair biomechanists,\\" according to Yahoo.com. Chris O'Leary speculated that some of the trouble was due to Prior's \\"Inverted W\\" arm action, in which he lifted his elbows above and behind the level of his shoulders, with the forearm pointing down. According to O'Leary, this created a timing problem that placed an undue stress on the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder and elbow because the arm got up to the \\"cocked position\\" too late. Similarly, Dick Mills, a former major league pitcher and co-author of The Science and Art of Baseball Pitching and Pitching.com, speculated that Prior's injuries were a result of scapular loading, a movement in which a pitcher's shoulder blades are pinched together and elbows are taken behind, and sometimes above, their shoulders. On the other hand, Ryan Fagan of The Sporting News speculated that Prior's injuries may have been the result of manager Dusty Baker overusing him in his early career, also pointing to his shoulder injury after running into Giles as a potential source of the trouble. Critics made Baker their \\"scapegoat,\\" according to Jason Buckland of the New York Times, blaming him for overusing his young pitcher. Prior himself speculated that the Giles injury and Hawpe's line drive were big factors. He said \\"I don‚Äôt blame Dusty for what happened to me,\\" observing that Baker had to balance how often to use the pitchers with making decisions that would help the Cubs win. Coaching career After his playing career ended, Prior accepted a front office position with the Padres in 2013 as an assistant in the team's baseball operations department, in a capacity designed to acquaint him with how a baseball front office worked. In 2015, he became San Diego's minor league pitching coordinator, serving in that capacity for three seasons. He was then hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as their bullpen coach for the 2018 season. MLB columnist Tim Brown speculated that the Dodgers might groom Prior to take over as their pitching coach when Rick Honeycutt eventually retired. Sure enough, after Honeycutt was reassigned in 2020, the Dodgers made Prior their pitching coach. Personal life Prior married his fiancee, Heather Gora, on November 15, 2003. The couple have three children: Amanda, Caitlin, and Matthew. After becoming a professional baseball player, Prior continued his education on a part-time basis and received a business degree from the USC Marshall School of Business in 2004.

In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry. Overview In explicit symmetry breaking, if two outcomes are considered, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different. By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution‚Äîany pair of outcomes has the same probability. In other words, the underlying laws are invariant under a symmetry transformation. The system, as a whole, changes under such transformations. Phases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the fractional quantum Hall effect. Examples =Mexican hat potential= Consider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis. But the ball may spontaneously break this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter. The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not. Mexican hat\\" potential function V(\\\\phi). In the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative scalar field theory. The relevant Lagrangian of a scalar field \\\\phi, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms, It is in this potential term V(\\\\phi) that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to Jeffrey Goldstone is illustrated in the graph at the left. This potential has an infinite number of possible minima (vacuum states) given by for any real Œ∏ between 0 and 2œÄ. The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to . This state has a U(1) symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of Œ∏), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or \\"spontaneously broken\\". In fact, any other choice of Œ∏ would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson, the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian. =Other examples= * For ferromagnetic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the magnetization, which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the Curie temperature, the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken. * The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full Euclidean group, but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a space group. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters. * General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in FRW cosmological models, the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background. * For the electroweak model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification. * In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field œà, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. * Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone boson. * Consider a uniform layer of fluid over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, convection cells will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry. * Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical diameter. As the rotational velocity is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial equilibrium point at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest gravitational potential). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, equidistant from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics Mexican hat\\" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, \\"spontaneously\\", and not all others. =Particle physics= In particle physics the force carrier particles are normally specified by field equations with gauge symmetry; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A by the same amount. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions. An actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. \\"Hidden\\" is a better term than \\"broken\\", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) because nothing (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations. Chiral symmetry Chiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions in particle physics. It is a property of quantum chromodynamics, the quantum field theory describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the nucleons, and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound quarks into 100 times heavier constituents of baryons. The approximate Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone bosons in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the pions, whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking. Higgs mechanism The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from gauge symmetries. The Higgs mechanism, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the superconductivity of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and gauge symmetries, is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics. In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The W and Z bosons are the elementary particles that mediate the weak interaction, while the photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The Weinberg‚ÄìSalam theory predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (1998). pp. 73‚Äì74. In addition, fermions develop mass consistently. Without spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the W and Z bosons) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the Higgs mechanism to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, detected in 2012. Superconductivity of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism. =Condensed matter physics= Most phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking rotational symmetry. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others. There are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like fractional quantum Hall liquids, and spin-liquids. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states. Continuous symmetry The ferromagnet is the canonical system which spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the Curie temperature and at , where h is the external magnetic field. Below the Curie temperature the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization m(x) such that . The symmetry is spontaneously broken as when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant. Spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization. Spontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry- breaking states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity. An important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one- dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations). Other long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the Coulomb potential or Yukawa potential has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries. It was shown, in the presence of a symmetric Hamiltonian, and in the limit of infinite volume, the system spontaneously adopts a chiral configuration, i.e. breaks mirror plane symmetry. =Dynamical symmetry breaking= Dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description (Lagrangian). Dynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the effective action). Dynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists an unstable Higgs particle in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. Electroweak interaction). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional Higgs mechanism in the standard model, by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as \\"Composite Higgs models\\"). Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a fermionic condensate; for example the quark condensate, which is connected to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Conventional superconductivity is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Generalisation and technical usage For spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore symmetric with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed \\"hidden symmetry\\", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the Goldstone boson.) When a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate which member is distinct, only that one is. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one. The crucial concept in physics theories is the order parameter. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a vacuum expectation value) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the ordered phase, and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a \\"frame of reference\\" to be measured against. In that case, the vacuum state does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized Wigner mode in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) Nambu‚ÄìGoldstone mode. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless Goldstone bosons arise. The symmetry group can be discrete, such as the space group of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a Lie group), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a vacuum state of the full quantum theory, although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry. Nobel Prize On October 7, 2008, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. Yoichiro Nambu, of the University of Chicago, won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically chiral symmetry breaking. Physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, of Kyoto University, shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the explicit breaking of CP symmetry in the weak interactions. This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a \\"just so\\" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.

The tradition of such a meeting of Welsh artists dates back to at least the 12th century, when a festival of poetry and music was held by Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth at his court in Cardigan in 1176, but the decline of the bardic tradition made it fall into abeyance. The current format owes much to an 18th-century revival arising out of a number of informal eisteddfodau. The closest English equivalent to eisteddfod is \\"session\\"; the word is formed from two Welsh morphemes: , meaning \\"sit\\", and , meaning \\"be\\". In some countries, the term eisteddfod is used for certain types of performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture. History Pronunciation of 'Eisteddfod' The date of the first eisteddfod is a matter of much debate among scholars, but boards for the judging of poetry existed in Wales from at least the early 12th century. These judging boards had probably derived from ancient Celtic bardic traditions. The first recorded eisteddfod was held under the auspices of The Lord Rhys at Cardigan Castle in 1176. There he held a gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all parts of Wales. A chair at the Lord's table was awarded to the best poet and musician, a tradition that prevails in the modern day National Eisteddfod. The earliest large-scale eisteddfod that is historically known is the Carmarthen Eisteddfod in 1451 under Thomas ap Gruffydd of Llandeilo. The next recorded large-scale eisteddfod was held in Caerwys in 1568. The prizes awarded were a miniature silver chair to the successful poet, a little silver crwth to the winning fiddler, a silver tongue to the best singer, and a tiny silver harp to the best harpist. Originally, the contests were limited to professional Welsh bards who were paid by the nobility. In the 16th century, Elizabeth I of England commanded that the bards be examined and licensed to ensure performance standards. But interest in the Welsh arts declined during the 17th and 18th centuries, leading to the standard of the main eisteddfod deteriorating. Gatherings also became more informal; poets would often meet in taverns and open spaces and have \\"assemblies of rhymers\\". These meetings kept traditions alive; the winners even still received a chair. A chair was a prized award because of its perceived social status. Throughout the medieval period, high-backed chairs with arm rests were reserved for royalty and high- status leaders in military, religious and civic affairs. As most ordinary people sat on stools until the 1700s, an armchair conveyed status to a winning bard. In 1789, Thomas Jones organised an eisteddfod in Corwen, where for the first time the public were admitted. The success of this event led to a revival of interest in Welsh literature and music. The earliest known surviving Bardic chair made specifically for an Eisteddfod was built in Carmarthen in 1819. Eisteddfod revival Iolo Morganwg (the bardic name of Edward Williams) founded \\"Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain\\" (Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain) in 1792 to restore and replace the ancient eisteddfod. The first eisteddfod of the revival was held on Primrose Hill, London. The Gentleman's Magazine of October 1792 reported on the revival of the eisteddfod tradition. The Blue Books' notorious attack on the character of the Welsh as a nation in 1846 led to public anger and the belief that it was important for the Welsh to create a new national image. By the 1850s people began to talk of a national eisteddfod to showcase Wales's culture. In 1858 John Williams ab Ithel held a \\"National\\" Eisteddfod complete with Gorsedd in Llangollen. \\"The great Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858\\" was a significant event. Thomas Stephens won a prize with an essay demolishing the claim of John Williams (the event's organiser) that Madoc discovered America. As Williams had expected Stephens's essay to reinforce the myth, he was not willing to award the prize to Stephens and, it is recorded, \\"matters became turbulent\\". This eisteddfod also saw the first public appearance of John Ceiriog Hughes, who won a prize for a love poem, \\"Myfanwy Fychan of Dinas Br√¢n\\", which became an instant hit. There is speculation that this was a result of its depiction of a \\"deserving, beautiful, moral, well-mannered Welshwoman\\", in stark contrast to The Blue Books' depiction of Welsh women as having questionable morals. The National Eisteddfod Council was created after Llangollen, and the Gorsedd subsequently merged with it. The Gorsedd holds the right of proclamation and of governance while the Council organises the event. The first true National Eisteddfod organised by the Council was held in Denbigh in 1860 on a pattern that continues to the present day. Current eisteddfodau = Welsh eisteddfodau = National Eisteddfod Prifardd Robin Owain in the bardic chair, 1991 The National Eisteddfod of Wales, Mold 2007 The most important is the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the largest festival of competitive music and poetry in Europe. Its eight days of competitions and performances, entirely in the Welsh language, are staged annually in the first week of August in varying locations that usually alternate between north and south Wales. Competitors typically number 6,000 or more; overall attendances generally exceed 150,000 visitors.  Urdd National Eisteddfod  Another important eisteddfod in the calendar is \\"Eisteddfod Yr Urdd\\" or the Youth Eisteddfod. Organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru, it involves Welsh children from nursery age to 25 in a week of competition in singing, recitation, dancing, acting and musicianship during the summer half-term school holiday. The event is claimed to be Europe's premier youth arts festival. Regional heats are held in advance and, as with the National Eisteddfod, the Urdd Eisteddfod is held in a different location each year. With the establishment of the Urdd headquarters in the Wales Millennium Centre, the eisteddfod will return to Cardiff every four years.  The International Eisteddfod  The International Eisteddfod is held annually in Llangollen, Denbighshire, each year in July. Choirs, singing groups, folk dancers and other groups attend from all over the world, sharing their national folk traditions in one of the world's great festivals of the arts. It was set up in 1947 and begins with a message of peace. In 2004, it was (unsuccessfully) nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Terry Waite, who has been actively involved with the eisteddfod.  Other eisteddfodau in Wales  Smaller-scale local eisteddfodau are held throughout Wales. One of the best known is the Maes Garmon Eisteddfod, Mold (). Schools hold eisteddfodau as competitions within the school; a popular date for this is Saint David's Day. = Celtic eisteddfod-like events = There are some Celtic-language-specific cultural festivals similar to eisteddfodau. Cornwall In Cornwall, an analogous event is known as (Cornish for \\"Eisteddfod of Cornwall\\") and is connected with Gorseth Kernow. Scotland The Scottish Gaelic Mod and the Breton Kan ar Bobl also have similarities to an eisteddfod. In Ireland, Seachtain na Gaeilge is similar to an eisteddfod; it celebrates Irish music and culture and promotes the use of the Irish language. The Fleadh Cheoil is an annual traditional music festival that takes place in the same town for a few years in a row, then moving on to another area of the country in an effort to include all localities in the celebration. Eisteddfodau outside Wales  Welsh emigration, particularly during the heyday of the British Empire and British industrial revolution, led to the foundation of formal and informal Welsh communities internationally. Among the traditions that travelled with these √©migr√©s was the eisteddfod, some of which‚Äîin a variety of forms and languages‚Äîstill exist. =United Kingdom= Eisteddfodau are held across the UK, although in most cases any explicit link to Welsh culture has been lost (beyond the use of the name for an arts festival or competition). In 1897 a Forest of Dean Eisteddfod, reportedly a choral competition, was founded at Cinderford. This annual event was still running in the 1940s. In the Methodist Church and other non- conformist denominations in England, youth cultural festivals are sometimes called eisteddfod. The Kettering and District Eisteddfod, for example, was founded in the Northamptonshire town by members of the Sunday School Union and still runs every March. For many years Teignmouth Grammar School in Teignmouth, Devon, held an eisteddfod of art, music and drama competitions in the Easter term. The Bristol Festival of Music, Speech and Drama was founded in 1903 as the Bristol Eisteddfod; the name still survives in the Bristol Dance Eisteddfod.http://www.bristoldance.co.uk/ The Teesside International Eisteddfod (Intertie) ran from 1966 to 1978. = Channel Islands = The eisteddfod idea has been taken up by non-Welsh speakers in the Channel Islands, particularly for the preservation of the local dialects J√®rriais and Guern√©siais, and is called such. See Jersey Eisteddfod. =Argentina= Eisteddfodau have been held since the initial Welsh settlement in Argentina in the late 19th century. Competitions nowadays are bilingual, in Welsh and Spanish, and include poetry and prose, translations (Welsh, Spanish, English, Italian, and French), musical performances, arts, folk dances, photography and video among others. A youth eisteddfod is held in Gaiman every September, and the main Chubut Eisteddfod is held in Trelew in October. An annual eisteddfod is also held in Trevelin, in the Andes and in Puerto Madryn on the coast. = Australia = Eisteddfods (Australian plural) in the traditional Welsh sense have also been adopted into Australian culture. However, the term is more commonly used to describe ballet competitions. For those eisteddfods like the Welsh original, they involve testing individuals in singing, dancing, acting and musicianship. The Royal South Street Eisteddfod in Ballarat has been running since 1891. At least 20 years earlier, as described in the diaries of Joseph Jenkins, Ballarat's Welsh community was conducting an annual eisteddfod each St David's Day (1 March). The Sydney Eisteddfod was first held in 1933 and offers some 400 events across all performing arts, catering to 30,000 performers annually. Modern equivalents in Australia are competitions reserved for schoolchildren, though many have open sections where anyone (including professionals) may participate and compete. Typically, a prize may be a scholarship to pursue a further career. Many young Australian actors and dancers participate regularly in the various competitions scheduled throughout the year. The WA Performing Arts Eisteddfod began in 1958 as the Bunbury Music Festival. The Gold Coast Eisteddfod in Queensland began in 1982 and is held annually in August and September. The 2018 eisteddfod attracted over 60,000 competitors. Many other communities host eisteddfods, including Alice Springs, Darwin, Brisbane, Hobart and Melbourne. = South Africa = A number of international performing arts competitions in South Africa are called eisteddfods, such as the Tygerberg International Eisteddfod and the Pretoria Eisteddfod (first held in 1923). The word \\"eisteddfod\\" is sometimes also used by schools for ordinary cultural festivals, even if only one school's students participate. =United States= Moving first as religious dissenters and then as industrial workers, many thousands of Welsh people emigrated to America from the 17th century. By 1851, Y Drych (\\"The Mirror\\") was just the latest of a number of Welsh-language newspapers, and in 1872 Hanes Cymry America (\\"A history of the Welsh in America\\") by R.D. Thomas attempted to catalogue all of the Welsh communities of the United States. Eisteddfods in North America are thought to have started in the 1830s, though the earliest documented examples date from the 1850s. Competitive eisteddfod were held during the American Civil War, with themes including George Washington, patriotism and Jefferson Davis. The largest U.S. eisteddfod was held In 1893 at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, featuring visiting Welsh choirs invited by The Cymmrodorion Society of Chicago. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which included a large number of Welsh immigrants, made its first appearance outside of Utah at this event.Linda Louise Pohly, \\"Welsh Choral Music in America in the Nineteenth Century,\\" PhD dissertation, Ohio State University, 1989,72. The eisteddfod idea was retained by some subsequent world's fairs, and helped to link the Welsh Eisteddfod community to its American offshoot. By 1913, a sub- gorsedd of North America with a Vice-Archdruid, Thomas Edwards (bardic name, Cynonfardd), was established at the Pittsburgh Eisteddfod, surviving until 1946. On 28 July 1915, the International Eisteddfod held in San Francisco at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition drew competing choirs from around the nation, including one mixed group composed of the German members of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus from New York. The tightly-rehearsed, all-male Orpheus Club of Los Angeles was judged the winner and was awarded $3,000.Musical America, 7 August 1915, p. 4. In 1926, the Pasadena Playhouse in California, held a competitive eisteddfod of one-act plays by local authors that subsequently evolved into an annual Summer One-Act Play Festival. Some smaller, regional eisteddfodau have deep historical roots. These include the Cynonfardd Eisteddfod in Edwardsville, Pennsylvania, which is the longest running eisteddfod outside Wales with its 128th appearance in 2017 at the Dr. Edwards Memorial Church. The Jackson School Eisteddfod in Jackson, Ohio, is the result of an historically strong Welsh business community, who funded the Southern Ohio Eisteddfod Association and a 4,000-seat auditorium that was the only dedicated eisteddfod venue in the United States. In 1930, the hall hosted the Grand National Eisteddfod. While economic decline halted the adult events, a youth festival, founded in 1924, still runs today, with support from the Madog Center for Welsh Studies at University of Rio Grande. In the 21st century the Internet and social media helped new eisteddfodau to spring up. The West Coast Eisteddfod (originally the Left Coast Eisteddfod) was founded by Welsh-American social network AmeriCymru and the non-profit Portland, Oregon, Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation in 2009. The 2011 event was co-curated by Lorin Morgan-Richards and held at the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, the site of Welsh-American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House, near Griffith Park, founded by Welsh-American philanthropist Griffith J. Griffith.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1345265992/2011-west-coast- eisteddfod-festival-welsh-arts-sho AmeriCymru hosts an annual online eisteddfod. Welsh Heritage WeekHeld each year in a different North American community (but regularly instead journeying to Wales itself), the Welsh Heritage Week course (WHW) teaches Welsh language, literature and performance. Started in 1980, the Welsh Harp & Heritage Society of North America sponsors the event. WelshHeritageWeek.org(2013). and Cwrs Cymraeg, two ambulatory Welsh language and culture courses held annually, usually in the United States, also each feature a mini-eisteddfod. The North American Festival of Wales held by the Welsh North American Association also includes an eisteddfod.

It was produced by ABC Entertainment, Sandy Feldman and Leonard Stogel. Pacific Presentations, a Los Angeles-based concert company headed by Sepp Donahower and Gary Perkins, coordinated the event, booked all the musical talent and ran the advertising campaign. Don Branker worked for Leonard Stogel and was responsible for concert site facilitation, toilets, fencing and medical. The California Jam attracted 300,000‚Äì400,000 paying music fans. The festival set what were then records for the loudest amplification system ever installed, the highest paid attendance, and highest gross in history. It was one of the last of the original wave of rock festivals, as well as one of the most well-executed and financially successful, and presaged the era of media consolidation and the corporatization of the rock music industry.  Performers  In order of appearance *Rare Earth *Earth, Wind & Fire *Eagles *Seals and Crofts *Black Oak Arkansas *Black Sabbath *Deep Purple *Emerson, Lake & Palmer The event was MC'd by New York DJ Don Imus. Deep Purple's performance was one of the first with their third line-up, which included vocalist David Coverdale and vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes. Deep Purple was given the choice of when to go on stage, and chose sunset, thus pushing Emerson, Lake & Palmer to the last performance. Having assumed that, as with all festivals, the show would run late, they nonetheless delayed their appearance even when the festival ran ahead of schedule. Angry organizers tried to force Purple onstage, and threatened to cancel their performance. A quick thinking announcer told the crowds that Deep Purple would be on \\"soon\\". The band made concertgoers wait nearly an hour until near dusk. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said the agreement was always for Purple to go on stage at dusk, and that the promoters were violating that signed agreement. In spite of this delay, the show did not end up running late. At the end of Purple's set, Blackmore threw a guitar and a small speaker monitor into the audience, and suddenly attacked one of the network's video cameras (the camera had been getting between the guitarist and the audience) with a guitar. Later on, a mishap with a pyrotechnic effect caused one of Blackmore's amplifiers to explode, which briefly set the stage on fire. Purple left the concert area by helicopter to avoid a possible confrontation with Ontario fire marshals and ABC-TV executives. The damage to the ABC video camera, estimated to be $10,000, was settled by the band's managers. The weather on the day of the Cal Jam concert was unusually warm for April. At one point in the late afternoon, thousands of plastic gallon jugs were handed out to the audience, who were able to fill the jugs up at the many drinking fountains set up on the grounds. During the prolonged delay waiting for Deep Purple to hit the stage, restless concert goers began tossing their water jugs in the air. More and more of the audience joined in, until the air above the crowd was filled with hundreds of water jugs flying around, spraying water over the audience. Deep Purple's performance, along with some of the performances by other bands, was broadcast on TV and radio nationwide in the US. It was at this festival that the footage of Keith Emerson playing a grand piano spinning end-over-end 50 feet above the ground was taken. For the Eagles' set, Jackson Browne deputized for absent guitarist Don Felder, whose wife was giving birth to their first child. Circus reported that Emerson, Lake & Palmer were \\"angry with the Deep Purple boys, who refused to come onstage until darkness fell. ELP subsequently couldn't begin their set until after one a.m.\\"  Attendance and technology  Organizer Don Branker The concert set a record for the largest paid attendance at such an event. (Although more people attended the festival at Woodstock in New York, only a few thousand had purchased tickets.) Circus reported that there were \\"more than 175,000 paid admissions\\" and that \\"the price was $10 in advance or $15 at the gate\\". Another record established at California Jam was for the largest (most powerful) concert sound system ever assembled. This arose from the demands of Deep Purple, who were identified as the \\"loudest band in the world\\" by the Guinness Book of World Records. Tycobrahe Sound Company combined the touring systems of Purple, Black Oak Arkansas, Black Sabbath, Earth Wind and Fire, and Rare Earth (each manufactured by Tycobrahe), plus bass horns from Phoenix Sound and several folded bass horns from Flag Systems. Total power was 54,000 watts RMS, provided by a number of BFA-2000 amplifiers, manufactured by Tycobrahe. Circus commented on \\"two 50 feet high speaker towers\\" that transmitted Black Oak Arkansas singer Jim Dandy's \\"hot and nasty growl to swarms of people spread clear across the speedway\\". The Goodyear blimp hovering overhead was a first for a music festival. Deep Purple arrived in their own chartered jet, the Starship, with the band's name painted on the sides. This was the first time a major band arrived specifically for a music festival in their own plane. Another first was the setting of the stage sets for each band on rails, allowing rapid changeover to the next band, thus eliminating delays and allowing the rock festival to run on time; in fact, ahead of time. Emerson, Lake and Palmer's touring sound system was set up about half a mile from the stage and timed with a tape delay to coincide with the sound from the stage.  Broadcast, telecast and record releases  Unlike other rock festivals such as Woodstock, the concert was not planned for release as a film or sound recording. However, the ABC television network (which was also a sponsor of the concert) broadcast several portions of the show as part of its In Concert series several months later. The audio portion of the show was also broadcast in stereo on FM radio stations, an early example of simulcasting. KLOS FM (then owned and operated by ABC) promoted and broadcast the concert around Los Angeles. Deep Purple's California Jam performance was the first full-length music concert film to be released and sold on video tape in the early 1980s. Several performances from the show were eventually released on CD and video, both in bootleg and authorized form. One of the more notable bootleg recordings was from a fan who tried to pass off his recordings of a recording from the radio broadcast as something he created. His web site was shut down after he tried selling his unauthorized products without creative approval from the artists involved and the producers of the festival. Authorized releases include: * California Jamming, CD of Deep Purple's performance (also released under different titles) * Live in California 74, DVD of Deep Purple's performance * Beyond the Beginning, Emerson, Lake & Palmer DVD including 44 minutes of their California Jam performance  Cultural impact  A sequel concert, California Jam II, was held March 18, 1978. A Facebook page called California Jam created by Allen Pamplin has become a focal point for attendees, organizers, and bands to submit photos, movies, and memorabilia.  Book  A special limited edition photo book of 1,000 copies (some with band autographs and purple vinyl) was compiled by Simon Robinson and released as Deep Purple at The California Jam and published by Rufus Stone Limited Editions in 2013.

Reilly (July 29, 1948 ‚Äì October 12, 2008) was an American soap opera writer. He was the head writer of NBC's Days of Our Lives and creator/head writer of Passions. Reilly won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Writing as co-head writer for Guiding Light in 1993. Reilly died in October 2008 while recovering from cardiac surgery. Career Reilly created the NBC Daytime soap opera Passions in 1999, and served as the series' head writer until its cancellation in 2008. He was previously the co-head writer of Guiding Light from 1990 to 1992 and Days of our Lives from 1992 to 1997. Reilly also worked as a staff writer for other daytime dramas prior to that, including The Young and the Restless and General Hospital. Though Passions was historically top-rated in key demographics, the series was plagued since its inception by low overall Nielsen ratings and the final episode aired on August 7, 2008.Passions recap (8/7/08) - SoapOperaDigest.com During his run on Passions, Reilly returned to Days of our Lives as head writer from August 18, 2003 until August 9, 2006, and was succeeded by former As the World Turns head writer Hogan Sheffer. Reilly was one of 20 writers who chose financial core status with the Writers Guild of America during the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike; after the strike, the WGA wrote a letter releasing the names of these individuals, inviting accusations of blacklisting. James E. Reilly had a triple major in psychology, social anthropology and biology. =Departure from traditional stories= In 1993, Reilly gained attention immediately after taking over as head writer on Days of our Lives for a storyline in which heroine Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell) is buried alive by villainess Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) for weeks, and taunted through speakers.Reilly would later revive this device twice on Passions for storylines involving Sheridan Crane (McKenzie Westmore) and Jessica Bennett (Danica Stewart). Reilly began what is arguably his most infamous storyline in 1995 when the show's central heroine, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall), becomes possessed by Satan. The storyline played out for a year, with Marlena's lover finally exorcising the demon, but not before garnering the show increased ratings ‚Äî despite frequent interruptions by the O.J. Simpson murder trial going on at the time, and the criticism of longtime fans upset by \\"liberties\\" Reilly took with the characters and continuity. Finally, in 1996 Reilly gave Eileen Davidson, who had played Kristen Blake since 1993, a second role as Kristen's lookalike Susan Banks, and between 1997 and 1998 added three more ‚Äî including a man ‚Äî with Davidson ultimately receiving a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1998. Reilly left Days of our Lives in 1997 and created Passions in 1999, freed of a pre-existing fan base to please. The series featured veteran actress Juliet Mills as Tabitha Lenox, a 300-year-old witch (with a doll-come-to-life sidekick) using magic and manipulation to wreak havoc on the citizens of a New England town. Standard soap opera melodrama was juxtaposed with sorcery, supernatural creatures and closet doors leading to Hell. In an attempt to boost ratings, Reilly was asked to return to Days of our Lives as head writer in the summer of 2003. Days executive producers gave Reilly carte blanche to \\"fix\\" the show (while simultaneously remaining as head writer for Passions). What followed was a controversial and attention-getting storyline in which multiple long-running characters on the series are brutally murdered by a serial killer dubbed the Salem Stalker. The story grew increasingly graphic (and ironic) as recovering alcoholic Maggie Horton is bludgeoned by a liquor bottle and original cast member and town matriarch Alice Horton chokes to death on a donut, her culinary specialty, forced down her throat. The reveal that heroine Marlena Evans was somehow the killer made the February 3, 2004 cover of Soap Opera Digest. This was not all; shortly after Marlena died after being exposed as the killer, all the victims were discovered alive on the island of Melaswen (New Salem backwords), which revealed that Marlena had in fact been mind controlled to believe she was the killer. Reilly left the series again in 2006. Death After Reilly's October 2008 death, Executive Producer Ken Corday of Days of our Lives said of him, \\"The DAYS OF OUR LIVES family is deeply saddened by the recent passing of James E. Reilly. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. Jim was not only an ingenious storyteller who changed the landscape of daytime drama, but he celebrated life with passion, humor, and an appreciation for the best it has to offer. He was an inspiration for us all...and will be greatly missed.\\" Passions Executive Producer Lisa de Cazotte said, \\"Jim Reilly was not only a legend in our industry, but he was a great friend and mentor. His creativity, sense of humor and genius will be sorely missed. There will never be another like him and I am deeply grateful for the years we spent working together on PASSIONS and for the joy he brought to my life.\\" Positions held Capitol *Associate Head writer: 1982 Ryan's Hope *Co-Head writer: December 1983 - February 1985 General Hospital *Outline Writer: 1985 - 1988 The Young and the Restless *Script Writer: 1990 The Bold and the Beautiful *Consultant: 1990 Guiding Light *Co-Head writer: 1990 - 1992 Days of Our Lives *Head writer: December 21, 1992 - January 5, 1998; August 11, 2003 - August 9, 2006 *Associate Head writer: 1989 Sunset Beach *Executive Story Consultant: 1997 - 1998 Passions *Creator *Head writer: 1999 - 2008 *Consulting Producer: 1999 - 2008 Awards and nominations Daytime Emmy Awards WINS *(1993; Best Writing; Guiding Light) NOMINATIONS *(1986; Best Writing; General Hospital) *(1991; Best Writing; The Young and the Restless) *(1992; Best Writing; Guiding Light) *(1994, 1997 & 1998; Best Writing; Days of Our Lives) *(2001, 2002 & 2003; Best Writing; Passions) Writers Guild of America Award WINS *(1992 season; Guiding Light) NOMINATIONS *(1994 season; Days of Our Lives) *(2001 season; Passions) Head writing tenure References External links * 1948 births 2008 deaths American soap opera writers Daytime Emmy Award winners Place of death missing Soap opera producers Writers from Utah Writers Guild of America Award winners People from Bountiful, Utah Screenwriters from Utah 20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"James E.

Entrance to notary's office in Vigo, Spain. \\"Der Notar\\" (\\"The Notary\\"), Copper engraving from 1698 book by Christoph Weigel the Elder A notary is a person authorised to perform acts in legal affairs, in particular witnessing signatures on documents. The form that the notarial profession takes varies with local legal systems. The Worshipful Company of Scriveners use an old English term for a notary, and are an association of notaries practising in central London since 1373. Overview Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An impartial witness (the notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization. To \\"notarize\\" a document or event is not a term of art, and its definition varies from place to place; but it generally means the performance by a notary of a series of possible steps, which may include the following (not an exhaustive list): # Identifying the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity including passport, driving license, etc. # Where land titles are involved or significant rights may accrue by reference to the identity, signatures may also be verified, recorded and compared. # Recording the proof of identity in the notarial register or protocol. # Satisfying the notary that the person appearing is of full age and capacity to do whatever is intended. # Taking an affidavit or declaration and recording that fact. # Taking detailed instructions for a protest of a bill of exchange or a ship's protest and preparing it. # Recording the signature of the person in the register or protocol. # Taking an acknowledgment (in the United States) of execution of a document and preparing a certificate of acknowledgement. # Preparing a notarial certificate (in most other jurisdictions) as to the execution or other step. # Sealing or stamping and signing the document. # Recording all steps in the register or protocol. # Delivering the completed original to the person appearing. # In some cases, retaining a copy of the document in the register or protocol. # Charging the person appearing a fee for the service. =Common law vs. Civil law notaries= Most common law systems have what is called in the United States a notary public, a public official who notarizes legal documents and who can also administer and take oaths and affirmations, among other tasks. Although notaries public are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. In the US (except Puerto Rico), any person ‚Äì lawyer or otherwise ‚Äì may be commissioned as a notary. Most civil law-based systems (including Puerto Rico and Quebec) have the civil law notary, a legal professional performing many more functions than a common-law notary public. They are qualified lawyers who provide many of the same services as common-law attorneys/solicitors (negotiation and drafting of contracts, legal advice, settlement of estates, creation of a company and its status, writing of wills and power of attorney, interpretation of the law, mediation, etc...) except any involvement in disputes to be presented before a court. In the United States, a signing agent, also known as a loan signing agent, is a notary public who specializes in notarizing mortgage and real estate documents. Notaries in civil law jurisdictions are specialized in all matters relating to real estate, completing title exams in order to confirm the ownership of the property, the existence of any encumbrances such as easements or mortgages and hypothecs. Often, in the case of lawyer notaries, the certificate to be provided will not require the person appearing to sign. Examples are: certificates authenticating copies (which are mostly not within the permissible functions of U.S. notaries) and certificates as to law, such as certificates as to the capacity of a company to perform certain acts, or explaining probate law in the place.  Online systems  In the United States, the states of Virginia, Texas, and Nevada have all passed laws allowing for online witness by notaries, using screen sharing or webcam as well as identity verification processes. Virginia was the first state to pass legislation allowing online notarization in 2012. Texas and Nevada passed similar laws in 2017 that went into effect in July, 2018. Some sites and apps include Notarize, DocVerify, NotaryCam, Safedocs, and SIGNiX. Notarize is also the first company to offer fully online mortgage closings, executing the first in August 2017 with United Wholesale Mortgage and Stewart Title. In the United States as of 2017 there are estimated to be over 4 million notaries employed.

By the time of the Cr√©cy campaign, he had apparently lost one of his eyes. Early life He was from a gentry family in Upholland, Lancashire. He was a son of Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand and Maud la Zouche. One of his brothers was Otho Holand, who was also made a Knight of the Garter. Military career In his early military career, he fought in Flanders. He was engaged, in 1340, in the English expedition into Flanders and sent, two years later, with Sir John D'Artevelle to Bayonne, to defend the Gascon frontier against the French. In 1343, he was again on service in France. In 1346, he attended King Edward III into Normandy in the immediate retinue of the Earl of Warwick; and, at the taking of Caen, the Count of Eu and Gu√Ænes, Constable of France, and the Count De Tancarville surrendered themselves to him as prisoners. According to chronicler Jean le Bel, they recognized Sir Thomas and his knights from earlier military campaigns on the continent during which they had traveled and fought side-by- side. Allegedly they shouted to him and his companions from the gatehouse window: \\"Ah! In God's name, sir knights, come up here and save us from those pitiless men who'll kill us like all the others if they catch us!\\" After securing the prisoners, Sir Thomas and the remainder of his retinue then allegedly returned to the fray, attempting to prevent further violence and protect the women and girls of the captured town. This latter incident is remarkable, being one of the very few recorded instances of true mercy (as opposed to the ransom-motivated sparing of prisoners) shown to any of the inhabitants during the otherwise luridly barbaric sacking of Caen, during which many women and girls were raped and an estimated 5,000 French were killed, the vast majority civilians. It is unrecorded, however, to what extent Sir Thomas and his men were successful. During the long journey of the English forces through the French countryside in the summer of 1346, Sir Thomas is recorded as having at one point ridden up to a bridge the French had broken at Elbeuf, killing two enemy soldiers and crying: \\"St. George for Edward!\\" At the Battle of Cr√©cy, Sir Thomas was one of the principal commanders in the vanguard under the Prince of Wales and he, afterwards, served at the Siege of Calais in 1346-7. In 1348, he was invested as one of the founders and 13th Knight of the new Order of the Garter. Around the same time as, or before, his first expedition, he secretly married the 12-year-old Joan of Kent, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent and Margaret Wake, granddaughter of Edward I and Margaret of France. However, during his absence on foreign service, Joan, under pressure from her family, contracted another marriage with William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury (of whose household Holland had been seneschal). This second marriage was annulled in 1349, when Joan's previous marriage with Holland was proved to the satisfaction of the papal commissioners. Joan was ordered by the Pope to return to her husband and live with him as his lawful wife, which she did, and had 4 children by him. Between 1353 and 1356, he was summoned to Parliament as Baron de Holland. His brother- in-law John, Earl of Kent, died in 1352, and Holland became Earl of Kent in right of his wife, although it was in 1360 that he was summoned to Parliament with that title. In 1354, Holland was the king's lieutenant in Brittany during the minority of the Duke of Brittany, and in 1359 co-captain-general for all the English continental possessions. Holland died of illness in Normandy on 28 December 1360. He was succeeded as baron by his son Thomas, the earldom still being held by his wife (though the son later became Earl in his own right). Another son, John, became Earl of Huntingdon and Duke of Exeter. Children Thomas and Joan of Kent had five children: * Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent * John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter * Joan Holland, who married John IV, Duke of Brittany * Maud Holland, married firstly Hugh Courtenay grandson of Hugh de Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon and secondly, Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny * Edmund Holland (c. 1354), who died young References External links * His profile in Britannia Biographies * His entry in Maximilian Genealogy - 1314 births 1360 deaths Earls of Kent (1360) Knights of the Garter Thomas Peers created by Edward III ","title":"Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent"},{"id":"297486","text":"Appalachian State University (; Appalachian, App State, App, or ASU) is a public university in Boone, North Carolina. It was founded as a teachers college in 1899 by brothers B.B. and D.D. Dougherty and D.D.‚Äôs wife, Lillie Shull Dougherty. The university expanded to include other programs in 1967 and joined the University of North Carolina System in 1971. The university is part of the University of North Carolina System and enrolls more than 19,000 students. It offers more than 150 bachelor's degrees and 70 graduate degree programs, including two doctoral programs. History Appalachian State University began in 1899 when a group of citizens in Watauga County, under the leadership of Blanford B. Dougherty and his brother Dauphin D. Dougherty, began a movement to educate teachers in northwestern North Carolina. Land was donated by Daniel B. Dougherty, father of the leaders in the enterprise, and by J. F. Hardin. On this site a wood frame building, costing $1,000, was erected by contributions from citizens of the town and county. In the fall of 1899, the Dougherty brothers, acting as co-principals, began the school named Watauga Academy. The first year saw 53 students enrolled in three grades. D.D. Dougherty's wife, Lillie Shull Dougherty, taught classes and contributed to administrative decisions. In 1903, after interest in the school had spread to adjoining counties, D. D. Doughterty was convinced the state would fund institutions established to train teachers. He traveled to the state capital, Raleigh, after drafting a bill. W. C. Newland of Caldwell County introduced the bill in the North Carolina Legislature to make this a state school, with an appropriation for maintenance and for building. Captain E. F. Lovill of Watauga County, R. B. White of Franklin County, Clyde Hoey of Cleveland County and E. J. Justice of McDowell County spoke in favor of the measure. On March 9, 1903, the bill became law, and the Appalachian Training School for Teachers was established. The school opened on October 5, 1903, with $2,000 from the state and 325 students. For 22 years, there was a period of steady growth, academic development, and valuable service to the state. In 1925, the legislature changed the name to the Appalachian State Normal School and appropriated additional funding for maintenance and permanent improvement. Four years later, in 1929, the school became a four-year degree granting institution and was renamed Appalachian State Teachers College. Over 1,300 students were enrolled in degree programs offered for primary grades education, physical education, math, English, science, and history. Appalachian State Teachers College Seal Appalachian attained national standards by becoming accredited by the American Association for Teacher Education in 1939, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1942. In 1948 a Graduate School was formed. Dr. Dougherty retired in 1955, after 56 years of serving the school. J. D. Rankin became interim president until Dr. William H. Plemmons was installed. Plemmons lead from 1955 to 1969, and his administration oversaw the addition of new buildings as the campus expanded and enrollment grew to nearly 5,000 students. Appalachian was transformed from a single-purpose teachers' college into a multipurpose regional university and Appalachian State Teacher's College became Appalachian State University in 1967. Growth continued in the 1970s to around 9,500 students and 550 faculty. Afterward, four degree granting undergraduate colleges were created: Arts and Sciences, Business, Fine and Applied Arts, and Education. Dr. Herbert Wey succeeded Plemmons as president in 1969 and was named chancellor in 1971. In 1972, Appalachian State became part of the University of North Carolina system. Campus A view from Sanford Mall. From left to right is D.D. Dougherty Hall, Belk Library, and Plemmons Student Union Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern North Carolina, Appalachian State University has one of the highest elevations of any university in the United States east of the Mississippi River, at . The university's main campus is in downtown Boone, a town of 19,205 compared to an ASU enrollment of 19,108 students. The campus encompasses , including a main campus of with 20 residence halls, 3 main dining facilities, 30 academic buildings, and 11 recreation/athletic facilities. The center of campus is nicknamed Sanford Mall, an open grassy quad between the student union, dining halls, and library. Sanford Hall, located on the mall's edge, is named for Terry Sanford, a former governor of the state. Rivers Street, a thoroughfare for town and university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections with tunnels and a pedestrian bridge connecting the two halves. The eastern half includes Sanford Mall, Plemmons Student Union, Roess Dining Hall (formerly known as Central Dining Hall), and Belk Library, along with two communities of residence halls. The west side has Trivette Dining Hall, the Student Recreation Center (or SRC), the Quinn Recreation Center, Kidd Brewer Stadium, and Stadium Heights and Yosef Hollow, the two remaining residence hall communities. At the north end, Bodenheimer Drive crosses over Rivers Street and leads to Appalachian Heights (an apartment-style residence hall), Mountaineer Hall, the Chancellor's House, the Living Learning Center, and Jim and Bettie Smith Stadium. The George M. Holmes Convocation Center at the south end of Rivers Street is the gateway and entrance to campus. The campus seen from the summit of Howard Knob The Turchin Center for the Visual Arts on the edge of main campus is the university's visual art center. The Turchin Center is the largest visual arts center in northwestern North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. It displays rotating exhibits indoors and outdoors, some exhibits being culturally specific to the Appalachians, and offers community outreach programs through art courses. The center was opened by Appalachian State in 2003. The newly renovated Schaefer Center for the Performing Arts, a 1,635 seat performance venue, hosts artists from around the world. Administration The University of North Carolina's Board of Governors plans and develops the coordinated system of higher education with the state. They set university policy but delegate Appalachian State's daily operations to a chancellor. The chancellor likewise delegates some duties to the provost, several vice-chancellors, and other administrative offices. These administrative offices are advised by several university committees on the needs of campus constituents, as represented by a Faculty Senate, Staff Senate, Graduate Student Association Senate, and the Student Government Association. =Presidents= * Dr. B.B.

The mountains offer snowboarding, skiing, tubing, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, camping, and fishing on and around the Blue Ridge Parkway. ASU also has over 400 clubs and organizations run by the McCaskey Center for Student Involvement and Leadership, such as Greek organizations, academic and diversity clubs, and sports clubs. Before the start of every semester, the University hosts a 'Club Expo' featuring all the clubs and organizations on campus. This event is for students to find an organization or club that suits them and to become involved. The university also has volunteer centers including the Multicultural Center, the LGBT Center, and the Women's Center (which is the only completely volunteer run Women's Center in the state of North Carolina). All three centers are under the supervision of the Multicultural Student Development Office. On November 11, 2016, ASU opened a fourth center in their student union; the Student Veterans Resource Center. The Appalachian Popular Programming Society (A.P.P.S.) is a university funded organization that exists to plan and provide diverse educational, enriching, and entertaining events for the community and student body of Appalachian State. Through its seven programming councils, A.P.P.S. members select, plan, promote, and present a diverse variety of popular entertainment programs and films which enhance the social and cultural life for Appalachian students. A.P.P.S. was founded in 1985 to help with the student nightlife and to support retention. APPS plays a vital role in fostering and developing an inclusive Appalachian State University community. The seven councils include Appalachian heritage, club shows, concerts, cultural awareness and student engagement (CASE), films, special events, and stage shows. Students can enjoy shows, dances, and concerts at Legends, an entertainment facility located on campus. Sustainability Appalachian has invested in several sustainability projects in recent years such as: * A wind turbine was installed at the Broyhill Inn and Conference Center in 2008. The wind turbine has become the most visible symbol of Appalachian's projects in renewable energy. Situated at the highest point on campus and standing more than tall, it was selected specifically to depict an industrial-scale wind turbine. , the turbine had produced over . *Both Frank Residence Hall, renovated in 2009, and The Mountaineer Residence Hall erected in 2011 have LEED¬Æ Gold Certifications. and received a total of 68 points based on its energy saving and sustainability features. 65 points are needed to receive gold certification. Mountaineer Residence Hall houses a 40-panel solar thermal system to provide hot water needs. Buildings on ASU's campus that utilize solar energy include the Varsity Gym, Plemmons Student Union, Raley Hall, and Kerr Scott Hall. Kerr Scott Hall also has the first green roof on campus. The green roof works to conserve energy by providing shade and removing heat from the air through evapotranspiration. *Appalachian Food Services is working to reduce food waste on campus by sending pre- and post-consumer food waste to a composting facility whose compost is used by Appalachian's Landscape Services as fertilizers. *The AppalCART is a transportation service that services the campus and surrounding community members. *Four BigBelly Solar Compactors were installed around Sanford mall in 2010. The BigBelly Solar Compactor is a patented compacting trash receptacle that is completely self-powered. Instead of requiring a grid connection, BigBelly uses solar power for 100% of its energy needs. The BigBelly unit takes up only as much space as the footprint of an ordinary trash receptacle, but its capacity is five times greater which saves money on labor costs. *Outside of the Living Learning Center sits The Edible Schoolyard which is a community space where students, faculty, and staff can maintain a garden plot to learn gardening practices. At this garden space, small-scale farming and gardening principles are pursued in an effort to teach productive maintenance of agricultural ecosystems, self-sufficiency, and permaculture. *The Environment-Economy-Ecology, or the E3, house sits outside of the John E. Thomas Building on Campus. The E3 house was built by students in the building science and appropriate technology programs at Appalachian State University. The ASU Renewable Energy Initiative allocated $30,000 towards the photovoltaic (PV) rooftop array. The house is used to test new technologies in building practices. Unlike most compact and transportable shelters, the structure is designed to be self-sufficient and adaptable to a variety of environmental and cultural situations. The design incorporates a blend of structural insulated panels for assembly speed and strength, combined with local construction techniques to create an energy-efficient envelope. It can accommodate up to five occupants. The building's energy-efficient features include use of structural insulated panels (SIPs) for the building's exterior walls and roof. The panels have an insulation R-value of 30, compared to R-19 in typical home construction. The building also has solar panels, which generate energy needs for the occupants, a system to collect rainwater from the roof, and low-flow plumbing fixtures. The PV array uses 16 panels to produce an estimated per year. *Bee Campus USA- In 2018, Appalachian State was awarded the title of Bee Campus USA. This certification assures that it is important to our students, staff, and faculty to provide safe habitats for pollinators and education about the pivotal role they play in ecosystems. *We Are Still In (2018)- Over 3,500 organizations, representative of the United States' economy and society, are showing the world that we stand by the Paris Climate Agreement and are committed to meeting its goals. *Tree Campus USA certification- Appalachian State University has received Tree Campus USA certification from the Arbor Day Foundation. The certification process was a collaborative effort between the Department of Biology, Department of Geography and Planning, Physical Plant and New River Light and Power. \\"This certification demonstrates Appalachian‚Äôs commitment to environmental aspects of sustainability,\\" *American Campuses Act on Climate Roundtable invited participant (2015)- Appalachian State University was one of 38 institutions of higher learning invited to participate in the American Campuses Act on Climate Roundtable Nov. 19 at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. The event was hosted by the White House Council on Environmental Quality. *Climate Leadership Award- In October 2015, the university was a recipient of Second Nature and the USGBC's Climate Leadership Award, which recognized Appalachian's commitment to climate action. *Climate Pledge- In addition, Chancellor Everts visited the White House for the Day of Climate Action and signed the American Campuses Act on Climate Pledge. Chancellor Everts also signed the newly revamped Second Nature Climate Commitment. *Received Carolina Recycling Association award- Appalachian State University's composting program has received the Outstanding Composting or Organics Program Award from the Carolina Recycling Association. Athletics Appalachian's sports teams are nicknamed the Mountaineers. The Mountaineers compete in NCAA Division I and are members of the Sun Belt Conference. Appalachian fields varsity teams in 20 sports, 10 for men and 10 for women. The Mountaineer football team started competing in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision in the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year. Kidd Brewer Stadium Kidd Brewer Stadium is the 30,000-seat home of Appalachian football. Nicknamed \\"The Rock\\", the stadium is located at an elevation of . In 2017, App State added a new video board, sound system and LED ribbon displays. Kidd Brewer Stadium also offers additional stadium seating with 18 luxury suites, 600 club seats, and the Chancellor's Box areas that offer a great view of the field and campus. Holmes Convocation Center The George M. Holmes Convocation Center is the home court for Appalachian's basketball teams. The arena, with seating for 8,325, is also the home for volleyball and indoor track and field. In 2017, a new Daktronics video board was installed. The board is made up of nine displays totaling a square footage of 1,200. University Recreation (UREC) also offers 20 club sports that compete with other regional institutions on a non- varsity level: lacrosse (men's and women's), rugby (men's and women's), soccer (men's and women's), ultimate frisbee (men's and women's), volleyball (men's and women's), climbing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, ice hockey, skiing, racquetball, snowboarding, swimming, and triathlon. The university's cycling team has had success at the regional and national level; they compete within the Atlantic Collegiate Cycling Conference. The team competes in every discipline of bicycle racing that is acknowledged by National Collegiate Cycling Association within USA Cycling. This includes road bicycle racing, Mountain bike racing and Cyclocross. The team won the Division 2, as established by USA Cycling, collegiate team mountain bike national championships in 2008. They won the Division 2 collegiate team cyclocross national championships in 2008 and 2009. The team is now recognized as a Division 1 team. On February 19, 2011, the Appalachian State Mountaineer women's basketball team won the 2011 Southern Conference regular-season title. The last time they had won the title was 1996. This is a first for Head Coach Darcie Vincent. On May 18, 2012, the Appalachian State baseball team beat Western Carolina University, becoming Southern Conference baseball champions for the first time since 1985. =Football= Appalachian won three consecutive Division I FCS (I-AA) national championships in 2005, 2006, and 2007, over the University of Northern Iowa, the University of Massachusett, and the University of Delaware, respectively. The Mountaineers are the first FCS football team to win three straight national championships since the playoffs began in 1978. They are also the first Division I program to win three consecutive national championships since Army accomplished the feat in 1944, 1945, and 1946. In a milestone for ASU athletics, on September 1, 2007, the Appalachian State football team played their season opener at the fifth- ranked University of Michigan in front of the largest crowd to ever witness an ASU football game. Appalachian State beat Michigan in the game that would become known as the \\"Alltime Upset\\" by Sports Illustrated with a final score of 34‚Äì32 and became the first Division I FCS (I-AA) football team to defeat a Division I FBS (I-A) team ranked in the AP poll. Appalachian State moved to the FBS subdivision in 2014, finishing its first season with a winning record but ineligible for a bowl bid per NCAA rules. Each season from 2015 to 2019, App State won both its conference championship and final bowl game. On September 21, 2019, Appalachian State beat the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 34‚Äì31, representing the Mountaineer's first Power Five conference win since the victory at Michigan in 2007. On November 9, 2019, Appalachian State followed up their victory over the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a victory over the University of South Carolina, beating the Gamecocks 20‚Äì15. 2019 was the first season the Mountaineers finished ranked in the final polls since joining the FBS, after briefly entering the top 25 during the 2018 season. The one-loss Mountaineers were No. 18 in the final 2019 Amway Coaches Poll and No. 19 in the final AP Top 25. =Athletic bands= The Hayes School of Music provides support for the Mountaineers at all home football games with the Marching Mountaineers, and at all home basketball games with the Appalachian Pep Band. The Marching Mountaineers travel to a select few away games each football season. The director of the athletic bands is Mr. Donald E. Peach (interim). In addition to supporting the athletic department, the Marching Mountaineers have assisted the Rho Tau chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia in hosting the Appalachian Marching Band Festival annually. In media In 2004, a committee for the Appalachian Family Caravan tour created a promotional video titled \\"Hot Hot Hot\\", shown throughout the area by Chancellor Kenneth E. Peacock. The video became an inadvertent internet phenomenon and was featured on VH1's Web Junk 20 program in early 2006. The video was never intended to promote Appalachian State to anyone but the Family Caravan, much less as a recruiting tool for prospective students. The video is no longer used by the university, due to student and alumni protests. In 2002, MTV's program Road Rules visited ASU to produce an episode called Campus Crawl, aired on-campus during an annual, winter student swimming event called the \\"Polar Plunge\\". The shows participants also crossed a high-wire strung between Coltrane and Gardner Halls. On March 16, 2012, Appalachian State placed a tenured sociology professor on administrative leave for a variety of charges, which included showing an anti-pornography documentary, The Price of Pleasure. This move gained national attention from the academic community.

He was best known as the head coach of the University of Alabama football team. During his 25-year tenure as Alabama's head coach, he amassed six national championships (tied for the most in modern college football history) and thirteen conference championships. Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the record for the most wins (323) as a head coach in collegiate football history. The Paul W. Bryant Museum, Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive, and Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium are all named in his honor at the University of Alabama. He was also known for his trademark black and white houndstooth fedora, deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines. Before arriving at Alabama, Bryant was head football coach at the University of Maryland, the University of Kentucky, and Texas A&M; University. He is considered by many to be the greatest college football coach of all time. https://www.espn.com/college- football/story/_/page/CFB150coaches/the-150-greatest-coaches-college- football-150-year-history Early life Paul Bryant was the 11th of 12 children who were born to Wilson Monroe and Ida Kilgore Bryant in Moro Bottom, Cleveland County, Arkansas. His nickname stemmed from his having agreed to wrestle a captive bear during a carnival promotion when he was 13 years old. His mother wanted him to be a minister, but Bryant told her \\"Coaching is a lot like preaching\\". He attended Fordyce High School, where tall Bryant, who as an adult would eventually stand , began playing on the school's football team as an eighth grader. During his senior season, the team, with Bryant playing offensive line and defensive end, won the 1930 Arkansas state football championship. College playing career Bryant accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Alabama in 1931. Since he elected to leave high school before completing his diploma, Bryant had to enroll in a Tuscaloosa high school to finish his education during the fall semester while he practiced with the college team. Bryant played end for the Crimson Tide and was a participant on the school's 1934 national championship team. Bryant was the self-described \\"other end\\" during his playing years with the team, playing opposite the big star, Don Hutson, who later became a star in the National Football League and a Pro Football Hall of Famer. Bryant himself was second team All-Southeastern Conference in 1934, and was third team all conference in both 1933 and 1935. Bryant played with a partially broken leg in a 1935 game against Tennessee. Bryant pledged the Sigma Nu social fraternity, and as a senior, he married Mary Harmon, which he kept a secret since Alabama did not allow active players to be married. Bryant was selected in the fourth round by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1936 NFL Draft, but never played professional football. Coaching career =Assistant and North Carolina Pre-Flight= After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1936, Bryant took a coaching job under A. B. Hollingsworth at Union University in Jackson, Tennessee, but he left that position when offered an assistant coaching position under Frank Thomas at the University of Alabama. Over the next four years, the team compiled a 29‚Äì5‚Äì3 record. In 1940, he left Alabama to become an assistant at Vanderbilt University under Henry Russell Sanders. During their 1940 season, Bryant served as head coach of the Commodores for their 7‚Äì7 tie against Kentucky as Sanders was recovering from an appendectomy. After the 1941 season, Bryant was offered the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas. However, Pearl Harbor was bombed soon thereafter, and Bryant declined the position to join the United States Navy. In 1942 he served as an assistant coach with the Georgia Pre-Flight Skycrackers. Bryant then served off North Africa, seeing no combat action. However, his ship, the converted liner , was rammed by an oil tanker near Bermuda and ordered to be abandoned. Bryant disobeyed the order, saving the lives of his men.\\"USS Uruguay (built 1928; passenger liner) survey report\\", HDC1668 (SAFR 23827), San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, reproduced by California Digital Library, University of California. Retrieved May 20, 2013. Allen Barra claims that two hundred others died in the collision. He was later granted an honorable discharge to train recruits and coach the North Carolina Navy Pre-Flight football team. One of the players he coached for the Navy was the future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham. While in the navy, Bryant attained the rank of lieutenant commander. =Maryland= Bryant as Maryland head coach in 1945 In 1945, 32-year-old Bryant met Washington Redskins owner George Marshall at a cocktail party hosted by the Chicago Tribune, and mentioned that he had turned down offers to be an assistant coach at Alabama and Georgia Tech because he was intent on becoming a head coach. Marshall put him in contact with Harry Clifton \\"Curley\\" Byrd, the president and former football coach of the University of Maryland. After meeting with Byrd the next day, Bryant received the job as head coach of the Maryland Terrapins. In his only season at Maryland, Bryant led the team to a 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 record. However, Bryant and Byrd came into conflict. In the most prominent incident, while Bryant was on vacation, Byrd brought back a player that was suspended by Bryant for not following the team rules. After the 1945 season, Bryant left Maryland to take over as head coach at the University of Kentucky. =Kentucky= Bryant coached at Kentucky for eight seasons. Under Bryant, Kentucky made its first bowl appearance in 1947 and won its first Southeastern Conference title in 1950. The 1950 Kentucky Wildcats football team finished with a school best 11‚Äì1 record and concluded the season with a victory over Bud Wilkinson's top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl. The final AP poll was released before bowl games in that era, so Kentucky ended the regular season ranked #7. But several other contemporaneous polls, as well as the Sagarin Ratings System applied retrospectively, declared Bryant's 1950 Wildcats to be the national champions, but neither the NCAA nor College Football Data Warehouse recognizes this claim. Bryant also led Kentucky to appearances in the Great Lakes Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Cotton Bowl Classic. Kentucky's final AP poll rankings under Bryant included #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952, and #16 in 1953. The 1950 season was Kentucky's highest rank until it finished #6 in the final 1977 AP Poll. Though he led Kentucky's football program to its greatest achievement, Bryant resigned after the 1953 season because he felt that Adolph Rupp's basketball team would always be the school's primary sport. Years after leaving Lexington, Bryant had a better relationship with Rupp. For instance, Bryant was Alabama's athletic director in 1969 and called Rupp to ask if he had any recommendations for Alabama's new basketball coach. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky in the late 1940s. Newton went on to lead the Crimson Tide to three straight SEC titles.Recognizable Class - Published in Kentucky Alumnus =Texas A&M;= In 1954, Bryant accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&M; University. He also served as athletic director while at Texas A&M.; The Aggies suffered through a grueling 1‚Äì9 season in 1954, which began with the infamous training camp in Junction, Texas. The \\"survivors\\" were given the name \\"Junction Boys\\". Two years later, Bryant led the 1956 Texas A&M; Aggies football team to the Southwest Conference championship with a 34‚Äì21 victory over the Texas Longhorns at Austin. The following year, Bryant's star back John David Crow won the Heisman Trophy, and the 1957 Aggies were in title contention until they lost to the #20 Rice Owls in Houston, amid rumors that Alabama would be going after Bryant. Again, as at Kentucky, Bryant attempted to integrate the Texas A&M; squad. \\"We'll be the last football team in the Southwest Conference to integrate\\", he was told by a Texas A&M; official. \\"Well\\", Bryant replied, \\"then that's where we're going to finish in football.\\" At the close of the 1957 season, having compiled an overall 25‚Äì14‚Äì2 record at Texas A&M;, Bryant returned to Tuscaloosa to take the head coaching position, succeeding Jennings B. Whitworth, as well as the athletic director job at Alabama. =Alabama= Memorial of Bryant outside of Legion Field When asked why he returned to his alma mater, Bryant replied, \\"Mama called. And when Mama calls, you just have to come runnin'.\\" Bryant's first spring practice back at Alabama was much like what happened at Junction. Some of Bryant's assistants thought it was even more difficult, as dozens of players quit the team. After winning a combined four games in the three years before Bryant's arrival (including Alabama's only winless season on the field in modern times), the Tide went 5‚Äì4‚Äì1 in Bryant's first season. The next year, in 1959, Alabama beat Auburn and appeared in the inaugural Liberty Bowl, the first time the Crimson Tide had beaten Auburn or appeared in a bowl game in six years. In 1961, with quarterback Pat Trammell and football greats Lee Roy Jordan and Billy Neighbors, Alabama went 11‚Äì0 and defeated Arkansas 10‚Äì3 in the Sugar Bowl to claim the national championship. The next three years (1962‚Äì1964) featured Joe Namath at quarterback and were among Bryant's finest. The 1962 season ended with a 17‚Äì0 victory in the Orange Bowl over Bud Wilkinson's Oklahoma Sooners. The 1963 season ended with a 12‚Äì7 victory over Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl, which was the first game between the two Southeastern Conference neighbors in almost 20 years, and only the second in 30 years. In 1964, the Tide won another national championship, but lost 21‚Äì17 to Texas in the Orange Bowl, in the first nationally televised college game in color. The Tide ended up sharing the 1964 national title with Arkansas, as the Razorbacks won the Cotton Bowl Classic, and had beaten Texas in Austin. Before 1968, the AP and UPI polls gave out their championships before the bowl games. The AP ceased this practice before the 1968 season, but the UPI continued until 1973. The 1965 Crimson Tide repeated as champions after defeating Nebraska, 39‚Äì28, in the Orange Bowl. Coming off back-to-back national championship seasons, Bryant's 1966 Alabama team went undefeated in, beating a strong Nebraska team, 34‚Äì7, in the Sugar Bowl. However, Alabama finished third in the nation behind national co-champions Michigan State and Notre Dame, who had previously played to a 10‚Äì10 tie in a late regular season game. In a biography of Bryant written by Allen Barra, the author suggests that the major polling services refused to elect Alabama as national champion for a third straight year because of Alabama Governor George Wallace's recent stand against integration The 1967 Alabama team was billed as another national championship contender with star quarterback Kenny Stabler returning, but they stumbled out of the gate and tied Florida State, 37‚Äì37, at Legion Field. Alabama finished the year at 8‚Äì2‚Äì1, losing 20‚Äì16 in the Cotton Bowl Classic to Texas A&M;, coached by former Bryant player and assistant coach Gene Stallings. In 1968, Bryant again could not match his previous successes, as the team went 8‚Äì3, losing to the Missouri, 35‚Äì10, in the Gator Bowl. The 1969 and 1970 teams finished 6‚Äì5 and 6‚Äì5‚Äì1 respectively. After these disappointing efforts, many began to wonder if the 57-year-old Bryant was washed up. He himself began feeling the same way and considered either retiring from coaching or leaving college football for the National Football League (NFL). For years, Bryant was accused of racism for refusing to recruit black players, but he merely said that the prevailing social climate and the overwhelming presence of noted segregationist George Wallace, first as governor and then as a presidential candidate, did not let him do this. He finally was able to convince the administration to allow him to do so after scheduling the Tide's 1970 season opener against a strong USC team led by black fullback Sam Cunningham. Cunningham rushed for 150 yards and two touchdowns in a 42‚Äì21 victory against the overmatched Tide. After that season, Bryant was able to recruit Wilbur Jackson as Alabama's first black scholarship player, and junior-college transfer John Mitchell became the first player for Alabama. By 1973, one-third of the team's starters were black, and Mitchell became the Tide's first black coach that season. In 1971, Bryant began engineering a comeback. This included abandoning Alabama's old power offense for the relatively new wishbone formation. Darrell Royal, the Texas football coach whose assistant, Emory Bellard virtually invented the wishbone, taught Bryant its basics, but Bryant developed successful variations of the wishbone that Royal had never used. The change helped make the remainder of the decade a successful one for the Crimson Tide. The 1971 Alabama Crimson Tide football team went undefeated in the regular season and rose to #2 in the AP Poll, but lost to top-ranked Nebraska, 38‚Äì6, in the Orange Bowl. Bryant's 1973 squad split national championships with Notre Dame, who defeated Alabama, 24‚Äì23, in the Sugar Bowl. The UPI thereafter moved its final poll until after the bowl games. The 1978 Alabama Crimson Tide football team split the national title with USC despite losing to the Trojans in September. Bryant won his sixth and final national title in 1979 after a 24‚Äì9 Sugar Bowl victory over Arkansas. Bryant coached at Alabama for 25 years, winning six national titles (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979) and thirteen SEC championships. Bryant's win over in-state rival Auburn, coached by former Bryant assistant Pat Dye on November 28, 1981 was Bryant's 315th as a head coach, which was the most of any head coach at that time. His all-time record as a coach was 323‚Äì85‚Äì17. Personal life and death  Bryant was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life, and his health began to decline in the late 1970s. He collapsed due to a cardiac episode in 1977 and decided to enter alcohol rehab, but resumed drinking after only a few months of sobriety. Bryant experienced a mild stroke in 1980 that weakened the left side of his body and another cardiac episode in 1981 and was taking a battery of medications in his final years. Shortly before his death, Bryant met with evangelist Robert Schuller on a plane flight and the two talked extensively about religion, which apparently made an impression on the coach, who felt considerable guilt over his mistreatment of the Junction Boys and hiding his smoking and drinking habits from his mother. After a sixth-place SEC finish in the 1982 season that included losses to LSU and Tennessee, each for the first time since 1970, Bryant, who had turned 69 that September, announced his retirement, stating, \\"This is my school, my alma mater. I love it and I love my players. But in my opinion, they deserved better coaching than they have been getting from me this year.\\" His last regular-season game was a 23‚Äì22 loss to Auburn and his last postseason game was a 21‚Äì15 victory in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee, over the University of Illinois. After the game, Bryant was asked what he planned to do now that he was retired. He replied, \\"Probably croak in a week.\\" Four weeks after making that comment, and just one day after passing a routine medical checkup, on January 25, 1983, Bryant checked into Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa after experiencing chest pain. A day later, when being prepared for an electrocardiogram, he died after suffering a massive heart attack. His personal physician, Dr. William Hill, said that he was amazed that Bryant had been able to coach Alabama to two national championships in what would be the last five years of his life, given the poor state of his health. First news of Bryant's death came from Bert Bank (WTBC Radio Tuscaloosa) and on the NBC Radio Network (anchored by Stan Martyn and reported by Stewart Stogel).Bear Bryant: 25 Years techography.com. Retrieved on October 17, 2008. On his hand at the time of his death was the only piece of jewelry he ever wore, a gold ring inscribed \\"Junction Boys\\". He is interred at Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery. A month after his death, Bryant was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, by President Ronald Reagan. A moment of silence was held before Super Bowl XVII, played four days after Bryant's death. Defamation suit In 1962, Bryant filed a libel suit against The Saturday Evening Post for printing an article by Furman Bisher (\\"College Football Is Going Berserk\\") that charged him with encouraging his players to engage in brutality in a 1961 game against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Six months later, the magazine published \\"The Story of a College Football Fix\\" that charged Bryant and Georgia Bulldogs athletic director and ex-coach Wally Butts with conspiring to fix their 1962 game together in Alabama's favor. Butts also sued Curtis Publishing Co. for libel. The case was decided in Butts' favor in the US District Court of Northern Georgia in August 1963, but Curtis Publishing appealed to the Supreme Court. As a result of Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts 388 U.S. 130 (1967), Curtis Publishing was ordered to pay $3,060,000 in damages to Butts. The case is considered a landmark case because it expanded the definition of who can be considered a \\"public figure\\" in libel cases. Bryant reached a separate out-of-court settlement on both of his cases for $300,000 against Curtis Publishing in January 1964. Honors and awards * 12-time Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year * The portion of 10th Street which runs through the University of Alabama campus was renamed Paul W. Bryant Drive. * Three-time National Coach of the Year in 1961, 1971, and 1973. The national coach of the year award was subsequently named the Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant Award in his honor. * In 1975, Alabama's Denny Stadium was renamed Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium in his honor. Bryant would coach the final seven years of his tenure at the stadium, and is thus one of only four men in Division I-A/FBS to have coached in a stadium named after him. The others are Shug Jordan at Auburn, Bill Snyder at Kansas State and LaVell Edwards at BYU. * Was named Head Coach of Sports Illustrated's NCAA Football All-Century Team. *He received 1.5 votes for the Democratic Party Presidential nomination at the extremely contentious 1968 Democratic Convention *In 1979, Bryant received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Tom Landry. *In February 1983, Bryant was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. *Bryant was honored with a U.S. postage stamp in 1996. *Country singer Roger Hallmark recorded a tribute song in his honor. *Charles Ghigna wrote a poem that appeared in the Birmingham-Post Herald in 1983 as a tribute to Bryant. *Super Bowl XVII was dedicated to Bryant. A moment of silence was held in his memory during the pregame ceremonies. Some of his former Alabama players were on the rosters of both teams, including Miami Dolphins nose tackle Bob Baumhower and running back Tony Nathan, and Washington Redskins running back Wilbur Jackson. Also, at the end of Leslie Easterbrook's performance of the National Anthem, several planes from Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama did the traditional missing-man formation over the Rose Bowl in his memory. Legacy Many of Bryant's former players and assistant coaches went on to become head coaches at the collegiate level and in the National Football League. Danny Ford (Clemson, 1981), Howard Schnellenberger (Miami of Florida, 1983), and Gene Stallings (Alabama, 1992), and one of the Junction Boys, all won national championships as head coaches for NCAA programs while Joey Jones, Mike Riley, and David Cutcliffe are active head coaches in the NCAA. Charles McClendon, Jerry Claiborne, Sylvester Croom, Jim Owens, Jackie Sherrill, Bill Battle, and Pat Dye were also notable NCAA head coaches. Croom was the SEC's first African-American head coach at Mississippi State from 2004 through 2008. NFL head coach Bruce Arians was a running backs coach under Bryant in 1981‚Äì82. Ozzie Newsome, who played for Bryant at Alabama from 1974-1977, played professional football for the Cleveland Browns for 13 seasons (1978-1990), and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Newsome was the general manager of the Cleveland Browns-Baltimore Ravens from 1996 through 2018. . Newsome was the GM of the Ravens' Super Bowl XXXV championship team in 2000, and their Super Bowl XLVII championship team in 2012. Jack Pardee, one of the Junction Boys, played linebacker in the NFL for 16 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins, was a college head coach at the University of Houston, and was an NFL head coach with Chicago, Washington, and Houston. Bryant was portrayed by Gary Busey in the 1984 film The Bear, by Sonny Shroyer in the 1994 film Forrest Gump, Tom Berenger in the 2002 film The Junction Boys, and Jon Voight in the 2015 film Woodlawn. In a 1980 interview with Time magazine, Bryant admitted that he had been too hard on the Junction Boys and \\"If I were one of their players, I probably would have quit too.\\" Head coaching record In his 38 seasons as a head coach, Bryant had 37 winning seasons and participated in a total of 29 postseason bowl games, including 24 consecutively at Alabama. He won 15 bowl games, including eight Sugar Bowls. Bryant still holds the records as the youngest college football head coach to win 300 games and compile 30 winning seasons.

The IGF competition awards a total of $50,000 in prizes to independent developers in Main Competition and Student Competition categories, and held around the same time as the Game Developers Choice Awards event. Founded in 1998 to promote independent video game developers, and innovation in video game development,\\"About the IGF\\", www.IGF.com. IGF wants to do for the independent game community the same benefit the Sundance Film Festival has brought to the independent film community, IGF is owned by the CMP Game Group, producers of the Game Developers Conference, Game Developer magazine, and Gamasutra.com. Competition Structure The festival awards ceremony is split into two broad categories: the main IGF competition and the IGF Student Showcase. The main Independent Games Festival, held in March 2012 at San Francisco's GDC 2012, distributed nine major awards: *Seumas McNally Grand Prize ($30,000) *Nuovo Award ($5,000) (originally Innovation Award) *Excellence In Visual Art ($3,000) *Excellence In Audio ($3,000) *Excellence in Design ($3,000) *Technical Excellence ($3,000) *Best Mobile Game ($3,000) *Audience Award ($3,000) An additional award, \\"Excellent in Narrative\\", was added for the 2013 IGF. In addition, the IGF's Student Showcase competition gives out the following awards each year: *IGF Student Showcase Winner (eight winners, $500) *Best Student Game ($3000) Prior to the Festival, developers have the opportunity to submit their game in a playable state to the IGF organization committee for a small fee. These titles are then send to approximately 300 game industry representatives on the Nominating Committee; these representatives include both indie developers and more mainstream developers and publishers. Each Committee member can nominate any of the provided games to one or more of the categories. Then, for each award category, a pre-selected jury of between seven and fifteen members reviews the nominations and makes a final selection of six finalists (eight for the Nuovo award) and a number of honorable mentions. The selected finalists are expected to present their games at the IGF during the Games Developers Conference; the show provides them a booth space and access to the convention, but finalists either must secure their own travel and lodgings, or name a proxy to demonstrate their games. During the convention, a separate jury selected by the IGF organization committee will review each game, and just prior to the awards, vote for one game in each category. The only exception is the Audience Award, which is voted through online forms by anyone interested.

Family and early Life Thomas Holland was born in Upholand, Lancashire, in 1350. He was the eldest surviving son of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan \\"The Fair Maid of Kent\\". His mother was a daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, and Margaret Wake. Edmund was in turn a son of Edward I of England and his second Queen consort Marguerite of France, and thus a younger half- brother of Edward II of England. His father died in 1360, and later that year, on 28 December, Thomas became Baron Holand. His mother was still Countess of Kent in her own right, and in 1361 she married Edward, the Black Prince, the son of King Edward III. Military career At sixteen, in 1366, Holland was appointed captain of the English forces in Aquitaine. Over the next decade he fought in various campaigns, including the Battle of N√°jera, under the command of his stepfather Edward, the Black Prince. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1375. Richard II became king in 1377, and soon Holland acquired great influence over his younger half-brother, which he used for his own enrichment. In 1381, he succeeded as Earl of Kent. Later years and death Prior to his death, Holland was appointed Governor of Carisbrooke Castle. Holland died at Arundel Castle, Sussex, England on 25 April 1397.

By his wife he had four sons and six daughters. All the sons died without legitimate children, whereupon the daughters and their children became co- heiresses to the House of Holland. The children were as follows: =Sons= # Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent, 1st Duke of Surrey (8 September 1372 ‚Äì 7 January 1400), eldest son and heir, created Duke of Surrey. Died without children. # John Holland (2 November 1374 ‚Äì 5 November 1394), second son, died without children # Richard Holland (3 April 1376 ‚Äì 21 May 1396), third son # Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent (9 January 1382 ‚Äì 15 September 1408), heir to his elder brother. Died without legitimate children, but had an illegitimate child by his mistress Constance of York. =Daughters= By his daughters' marriages, he became the ancestor of many of the prominent figures in the Wars of the Roses, including Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York (father of Kings Edward IV and Richard III), Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII), and Warwick the Kingmaker, father of queen consort Anne Neville. He was also an ancestor of queen consort Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of King Henry VIII. His daughters were as follows: # Eleanor I Holland, alias Alianore (13 October 1370 ‚Äì 23 October 1405). Married firstly to Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374‚Äì1398), for a time heir presumptive to his mother's first cousin King Richard II, and left children. Following the deposition of Richard II in 1399 by his own first cousin, Henry IV, the claim to the throne of England was pursued by Roger's and Alianore's grandson Richard, Duke of York (1411‚Äì1460), the drawn-out struggle of which formed the basis for the Wars of the Roses. Secondly, she married Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, and left children. # Joan Holland (c. 1380 ‚Äì 12 April 1434), married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York # Margaret Holland (1385 ‚Äì 31 December 1439), married first John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, and second Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence # Elizabeth Holland, who married Sir John Neville (c.1387‚Äì1420), eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and by him had three sons, Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, John Neville, Baron Neville, and Sir Thomas Neville, and a daughter, Margaret Neville.. # Eleanor II Holland (1386 ‚Äì after 1413), who bore the same first name as her eldest sister, married Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury # Bridget Holland, who became a nun  Ancestry  Footnotes References  - 1350 births 1397 deaths Earls of Kent (1360) Edward the Black Prince Thomas Knights of the Garter ","title":"Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent"},{"id":"297493","text":"In abstract algebra, a composition series provides a way to break up an algebraic structure, such as a group or a module, into simple pieces. The need for considering composition series in the context of modules arises from the fact that many naturally occurring modules are not semisimple, hence cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of simple modules. A composition series of a module M is a finite increasing filtration of M by submodules such that the successive quotients are simple and serves as a replacement of the direct sum decomposition of M into its simple constituents. A composition series may not exist, and when it does, it need not be unique. Nevertheless, a group of results known under the general name Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem asserts that whenever composition series exist, the isomorphism classes of simple pieces (although, perhaps, not their location in the composition series in question) and their multiplicities are uniquely determined. Composition series may thus be used to define invariants of finite groups and Artinian modules. A related but distinct concept is a chief series: a composition series is a maximal subnormal series, while a chief series is a maximal normal series. For groups If a group G has a normal subgroup N, then the factor group G/N may be formed, and some aspects of the study of the structure of G may be broken down by studying the \\"smaller\\" groups G/N and N. If G has no normal subgroup that is different from G and from the trivial group, then G is a simple group. Otherwise, the question naturally arises as to whether G can be reduced to simple \\"pieces\\", and if so, are there any unique features of the way this can be done? More formally, a composition series of a group G is a subnormal series of finite length :1 = H_0\\\\triangleleft H_1\\\\triangleleft \\\\cdots \\\\triangleleft H_n = G, with strict inclusions, such that each Hi is a maximal strict normal subgroup of Hi+1. Equivalently, a composition series is a subnormal series such that each factor group Hi+1 / Hi is simple. The factor groups are called composition factors. A subnormal series is a composition series if and only if it is of maximal length. That is, there are no additional subgroups which can be \\"inserted\\" into a composition series. The length n of the series is called the composition length. If a composition series exists for a group G, then any subnormal series of G can be refined to a composition series, informally, by inserting subgroups into the series up to maximality. Every finite group has a composition series, but not every infinite group has one. For example, \\\\mathbb{Z} has no composition series. =Uniqueness: Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem= A group may have more than one composition series. However, the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem (named after Camille Jordan and Otto H√∂lder) states that any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism. This theorem can be proved using the Schreier refinement theorem. The Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem is also true for transfinite ascending composition series, but not transfinite descending composition series . gives a short proof of the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem by intersecting the terms in one subnormal series with those in the other series. Example For a cyclic group of order n, composition series correspond to ordered prime factorizations of n, and in fact yields a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For example, the cyclic group C_{12} has C_1\\\\triangleleft C_2\\\\triangleleft C_6 \\\\triangleleft C_{12}, \\\\ \\\\, C_1\\\\triangleleft C_2\\\\triangleleft C_4\\\\triangleleft C_{12}, and C_1\\\\triangleleft C_3\\\\triangleleft C_6 \\\\triangleleft C_{12} as three different composition series. The sequences of composition factors obtained in the respective cases are C_2,C_3,C_2, \\\\ \\\\, C_2,C_2,C_3, and C_3,C_2,C_2. For modules The definition of composition series for modules restricts all attention to submodules, ignoring all additive subgroups that are not submodules. Given a ring R and an R-module M, a composition series for M is a series of submodules :\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} = J_0 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset J_n = M where all inclusions are strict and Jk is a maximal submodule of Jk+1 for each k. As for groups, if M has a composition series at all, then any finite strictly increasing series of submodules of M may be refined to a composition series, and any two composition series for M are equivalent. In that case, the (simple) quotient modules Jk+1/Jk are known as the composition factors of M, and the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem holds, ensuring that the number of occurrences of each isomorphism type of simple R-module as a composition factor does not depend on the choice of composition series. It is well known that a module has a finite composition series if and only if it is both an Artinian module and a Noetherian module. If R is an Artinian ring, then every finitely generated R-module is Artinian and Noetherian, and thus has a finite composition series. In particular, for any field K, any finite-dimensional module for a finite- dimensional algebra over K has a composition series, unique up to equivalence. Generalization Groups with a set of operators generalize group actions and ring actions on a group. A unified approach to both groups and modules can be followed as in , simplifying some of the exposition. The group G is viewed as being acted upon by elements (operators) from a set Œ©. Attention is restricted entirely to subgroups invariant under the action of elements from Œ©, called Œ©-subgroups. Thus Œ©-composition series must use only Œ© subgroups, and Œ©-composition factors need only be Œ©-simple. The standard results above, such as the Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem, are established with nearly identical proofs. The special cases recovered include when Œ© = G so that G is acting on itself. An important example of this is when elements of G act by conjugation, so that the set of operators consists of the inner automorphisms. A composition series under this action is exactly a chief series. Module structures are a case of Œ©-actions where Œ© is a ring and some additional axioms are satisfied. For objects in an abelian category A composition series of an object A in an abelian category is a sequence of subobjects :A=X_0\\\\supsetneq X_1\\\\supsetneq \\\\dots \\\\supsetneq X_n=0 such that each quotient object Xi /Xi + 1 is simple (for ). If A has a composition series, the integer n only depends on A and is called the length of A.

The system was unofficially used between 2000 and 2002, when a new romanization system for Taiwan was being evaluated for adoption. Taiwan's Ministry of Education approved the system in 2002, but its use was optional. Since January 1, 2009, the Ministry of Education has officially promoted Hanyu Pinyin (per decision on September 16, 2008); local governments would \\"not be able to get financial aid from the central government\\" if they used Tongyong Pinyin-derived romanizations. After this policy change, Tongyong Pinyin has been used for the transliteration of some place names and personal names in Taiwan (Republic of China). Some of the romanized names of the districts, subway stations and streets in Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, Yunlin County} and other places are derived from Tongyong Pinyin- for example, Cijin District (, C√≠jin Cyu).  History  left The impetus behind the invention of Tongyong Pinyin came from the need for a standardized romanization system in Taiwan. For decades, the island had employed various systems, usually simplifications or adaptations of Wade‚ÄìGiles. (Zhuyin, a standard phonetic system for language education in Taiwan's schools, does not use the Latin alphabet.) Tongyong Pinyin was introduced in 1998 by to preserve the strengths of Hanyu Pinyin while eliminating some of the pronunciation difficulties Hanyu presents to international readers, such as difficulties with the letters q and x. Yu's system was subsequently revised. Discussion and adoption of Tongyong Pinyin, like many other initiatives in Taiwan, quickly acquired a partisan tone turning on issues of national identity: Chinese vs. Taiwanese identity. Officials who identified most strongly with the nation itself, such as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allied parties, saw no reason to adopt Hanyu Pinyin just because Mainland China and the UN had. If Tongyong Pinyin more adequately met the nation's needs, they saw this as ample justification for Taiwan to adopt it. Officials who identified more strongly with Chinese culture, such as the Kuomintang (KMT), saw no reason to introduce a new system unique to Taiwan if Hanyu Pinyin had already gained international acceptance. Each side accused the other of basing its preference on anti-China or pro-China sentiment rather than an objective discussion of community goals. In early October 2000, the Mandarin Commission of the Ministry of Education proposed to use Tongyong Pinyin as the national standard. Education Minister Ovid Tzeng submitted a draft of the Taiwanese romanization in late October to the Executive Yuan, but the proposal was rejected. In November 2000, Tzeng unsuccessfully suggested that the government adopt Hanyu Pinyin with some modifications for local dialects. On 10 July 2002, Taiwan's Ministry of Education held a meeting for 27 members. Only 13 attended. Two left early, and since the chairman could not vote, the bill for using Tongyong Pinyin was passed with 10 votes. In August 2002 the government adopted Tongyong Pinyin by an administrative order that local governments had the authority to override within their jurisdiction. In October 2007, with the DPP administration still in power, it was announced that Taiwan would standardize the English transliterations of its Chinese Mandarin place names by the end of the year, after years of confusion from multiple spellings, by using the locally developed Tongyong Pinyin. In 2008, the Kuomintang won both the legislative and presidential elections. In September 2008, it was announced that Tongyong Pinyin would be replaced by Hanyu Pinyin as Taiwan's standard, at the end of the year. Since January 1, 2009, Hanyu Pinyin has been an official romanization system in Taiwan. On August 24, 2020, the Taichung City Council decided to use Tongyong Pinyin in the translated names of the stations on the Green line (Taichung Metro). Nanzi Station formerly read \\"Nanzih Station\\". The sign was later changed to read \\"Nanzi Station\\". The station serves Nanzih District, Kaohsiung. Adoption and use Signs using Tongyong Pinyin (Jhaishan, Jhushan and so on) in Kinmen in 2012. Note that Èáë is misspelled as jing (instead of the correct jin) in one of the signs Tongyong Pinyin was the official romanization system in Taiwan, but its use was voluntary. The romanization system that one encounters in Taiwan varies according to the government authority that administers the facility. Street signs in most areas use Tongyong Pinyin, including the cities of Kaohsiung, Tainan, and surrounding counties. A contrast could be seen in the two entities that now make up the municipality of Taichung‚ÄîTaichung County used Tongyong Pinyin while Taichung City has used Hanyu Pinyin since at least 2004. Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou remained committed to using Hanyu Pinyin as the Romanization standard for Taipei. Taipei County (now New Taipei City) used Tongyong Pinyin, but in Taipei Metro stations, Tongyong Pinyin was given in parentheses after Hanyu Pinyin. Modified Wade‚ÄìGiles spellings are popularly used for many proper names, especially personal names and businesses. The political impasse prevented Ministry of Education from being able to replace Zhuyin in teaching pronunciation in elementary school. Zhuyin is widely used to teach Mandarin pronunciation to schoolchildren. Children's books published in Taiwan typically display Zhuyin characters next to Chinese characters in the text. On September 17, 2008, the Ministry of Education announced that the government standard for romanization would be switched to Hanyu Pinyin nationwide, effective January 1, 2009. However, people in the Taiwan( Republic of China) can freely choose their foreign language names. So although Tongyong Pinyin was effectively scrapped as the romanization standard of Taiwan's central government, many today choose a romanized form of their Chinese character name which is created based on the Tongyong Pinyin, Wade-Giles, or Yale romanization systems. Today, districts of Kaohsiung are named by Tongyong. Districts of Tainan are mostly named by Tongyong with exceptions such as Xinying. Taiwanese language variant The Tongyong Pinyin system also exists in a Taiwanese Hokkien phonetic symbol version, Daighi tongiong pingim, which lacks f but adds bh. However, in 2006, the Ministry of Education rejected the use of Daighi tongiong pingim for the Taiwanese dialect and preferred the Taiwanese Romanization System.  Features  = Spelling = Some notable features of Tongyong Pinyin are these: * The first tone is unmarked. * Hanyu Pinyin's zh- becomes jh- (Wade‚ÄìGiles uses ch-). * Hanyu Pinyin's x- and q- are not used in Tongyong Pinyin and become s- and c- (Wade‚ÄìGiles uses hs- and ch'-). * The Hanyu Pinyin -i (not represented in Zhuyin) known as the empty rhyme (), are shown as -ih (somewhat like Wade‚ÄìGiles): those in Hanyu Pinyin as zi (), ci (), si (), zhi (), chi (), shi (), and ri () all end in -ih in Tongyong Pinyin. Syuejia/SyueJia Junior High School, Syuejia District, Tainan, Taiwan (the spelling 'Syuejia' is derived from the Tongyong Pinyin Syu√©ji«é.) * √º used in Hanyu Pinyin (written u after j, q and x) is replaced by yu. Taichung Metro includes a station at Fongle Park (from Tongyong Pinyin Fongl√®) * -eng becomes ong after f- and w- () * wen () becomes wun * -iong becomes yong: syong instead of pinyin xiong () (cf. -iang remains unchanged: siang). * Unlike in Wade‚ÄìGiles and Hanyu Pinyin, -iu and -ui (liu [] and gui []), contractions can be written out in full as -iou and -uei. However, according to the Ministry of the Interior, in romanizations of names of places that is at township-level or below township-level, the letters must be written in full. =Punctuation= * Tongyong syllables in the same word (except placenames) are to be separated by hyphens, like Wade‚ÄìGiles, but in the Ministry of the Interior's romanizations, placenames have no spaces between the syllables. * Tongyong uses tone marks like Zhuyin, not like Hanyu Pinyin. Tongyong Pinyin has no mark for the first tone but a dot for the neutral tone (optional on computers). =Shared features with Hanyu Pinyin= If tone is ignored, 19.47% of Tongyong Pinyin syllables are spelled differently to those of Hanyu Pinyin. The difference widens when syllables are measured according to average frequency of use in everyday life to a 48.84% difference in spellings. In two cases (si and ci) the same Latin spelling denotes different syllables depending on the transcription system. Arguments The prevalence of Hanyu Pinyin as an established system weighs at least as heavily on the debate over Tongyong Pinyin as any feature of the system itself. Arguments presented in the ongoing debate include these. =Supporting Tongyong Pinyin= Road sign in Nanzih District, Kaohsiung in which (Hanyu Pinyin: j≈´nxi√†o l√π) is written as 'Jyunsiao Rd.', based on the Tongyong Pinyin form jyunsi√†o l√π. Intrinsic * Tongyong spelling, it is argued, yields more accurate pronunciation from non-Chinese speakers than does Hanyu Pinyin. Tongyong does not use the letters q and x, for example, in ways that confuse non-Chinese speakers who lack training in the system. (This argument needs a credible reference, as current reference is to a letter to a newspaper by a non-expert. To refute such a statement it might be argued that it is an Anglocentrism because the value of Hanyu Pinyin x, for instance, would not be surprising for Portuguese speakers and users of Portuguese-influenced alphabets such as Vietnamese.) However, this argument is contradicted by internal inconsistencies in Tongyong Pinyin (for example, in the use of the letter \\"c\\" in Tongyong Pinyin to represent the sound , represented by \\"q\\" in Hanyu Pinyin). Such a pronunciation would require the same amount of familiarization as Hanyu Pinyin. * Those familiar with Hanyu Pinyin will encounter nothing radically different when using Tongyong Pinyin. * Tongyong eliminates the need for diacritics for the umlauted-u sound. * The spellings \\"fong\\" and \\"wong\\" are more accurate to reflect the sounds of È¢® and ÁøÅ, as pronounced in the Standard Mandarin in Taiwan, as compared with \\"feng\\" and \\"weng\\". Practical Sign at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan in which (Hanyu Pinyin: xƒ´nshƒìng d√†l√≥u) is written as 'Sin Sheng Building', based on the Tongyong Pinyin form sinsheng d√†l√≥u. * Tongyong Pinyin is business-friendly because of the ease it offers in pronunciation. Visitors to Taiwan can thus more easily describe and find place names, personal names, businesses and locales. * Tongyong Pinyin requires no more special accommodation in international correspondence than the difference in Chinese characters (simplified vs. traditional) already requires. * Tongyong strikes a balance between the need for internationalization and Taiwan's local needs. * Tongyong Pinyin would not supplant Hanyu Pinyin in Taiwan, as Hanyu Pinyin is rarely encountered outside the Taipei area anyway and has never been in common use. Tongyong Pinyin is intended to supplant the many variants of Wade‚ÄìGiles that remain the dominant form of romanization encountered in Taiwan. No one questions the superiority of Tongyong Pinyin to Wade‚ÄìGiles and the benefit to be gained from the change. * Tongyong does not force its exclusive use on those who have already studied Hanyu Pinyin. One can use any system to render characters while one types or formats documents in Mandarin. Computers and electronic devices in Taiwan already offer Hanyu Pinyin and MPS keyboards as options. Transitions between romanized forms are also easily achieved if needed. * Romanization is most useful to individuals who lack training in Mandarin but encounter names and terms in press reports and literature. Students of Mandarin gain literacy in Chinese characters and drop romanization systems of any kind. It, therefore, makes sense that, if possible, one should enable a confident first-time pronunciation of Mandarin words by outsiders. =Against Tongyong Pinyin= Intrinsic * Tongyong Pinyin treats c and s as having two allophones each: *: c is pronounced before \\"i\\", and otherwise *: s is pronounced before \\"i\\", and otherwise * Internal inconsistencies exist within Tongyong Pinyin such as the use of different letters to represent the same sound: e vs. u (ben, pen, fen and men but wun) and i vs. y (ciang but cyong, ) because of the correspondence with the equivalent Zhuyin spellings or the use of the same letter to represent different sounds (s, c and z, each representing both a dental and a palatal sibilant). Such inconsistencies are more numerous than those found in Hanyu Pinyin. Practical * The standard romanization system of Mainland China, the International Organization for Standardization, and the United Nations is Hanyu Pinyin. * Tongyong Pinyin-derived transliteration spellings are created. For example, \\"Qing Dynasty\\" (via Hanyu Pinyin) and \\"Ch'ing Dynasty\\" (via Wade‚ÄìGiles) is spelled as \\"Cing Dynasty\\" (via Tongyong Pinyin). \\"Zhou Dynasty\\" (via Hanyu Pinyin), or \\"Chou Dynasty\\" (via Wade‚ÄìGiles), is spelled as \\"Jhou Dynasty\\" (via Tongyong Pinyin).  Comparison with other orthographies  The word for 'China', written in Hanyu Pinyin, Tongyong Pinyin, and Chinese characters (traditional and simplified) The differences between Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin are relatively straightforward: *The palatalized consonants are written j, c, s rather than j, q, x *The retroflex consonants are jh, ch, sh rather than zh, ch, sh *The \\"buzzing\\" vowels are written ih (shih, sih) rather than i (shi, si) *Yu and yong are still spelled with a 'y' even after a consonant (nyu, ), rather than as √º, u, or iong *You and wei are written iou and uei after a consonant (diou, duei), rather than contracted to iu and ui *Eng is written labialized ong after the labial consonants f, w (fong, wong), but weng/wong contracts to ong after another consonant in both systems *Wen becomes wun *Neutral tone is written but not first tone Gallery TRA Formosa Star and Cidu Station sign 20050818 night.jpg File:È´òÈõÑÊç∑ÈÅãÂ∞èÊ∏ØÁ´ô (2330729579).jpg File:Êü≥ÁáüÂçÄÂúñÊõ∏È§®.jpg File:Kaohsiung RoadSign.svg File:Fusing Government ,TAIWAN.jpg See also *Hanyu Pinyin *Daighi tongiong pingim (DT in Taiwanese; ) References  External links  * Linguistic analysis * Bopomofo-Hanyu Pinyin-Tongyong Pinyin comparison chart * Êº¢Ë™ûÊãºÈü≥ËàáÈÄöÁî®ÊãºÈü≥Â∞çÁÖßË°® Hanyu Pinyin-Tongyng Pinyin comparison chart (Chinese) * Formal documents (in Traditional Chinese): from Academia Sinica * Toponomastic Rules (in Traditional Chinese): from Wikisource * Pinyin.info * Chinese Phonetic Conversion Tool - Converts between Tongyong Pinyin, Hanyu Pinyin, Zhuyin and other formats Mandarin words and phrases Romanization of Chinese Pinyin ","title":"Tongyong Pinyin"},{"id":"297500","text":"Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, 3rd Earl of Kent, KG, Earl Marshal (8 September 1372 ‚Äì 7 January 1400) was an English nobleman and courtier.

Lie superalgebras are important in theoretical physics where they are used to describe the mathematics of supersymmetry. In most of these theories, the even elements of the superalgebra correspond to bosons and odd elements to fermions (but this is not always true; for example, the BRST supersymmetry is the other way around). Definition Formally, a Lie superalgebra is a nonassociative Z2-graded algebra, or superalgebra, over a commutative ring (typically R or C) whose product [¬∑, ¬∑], called the Lie superbracket or supercommutator, satisfies the two conditions (analogs of the usual Lie algebra axioms, with grading): Super skew-symmetry: :[x,y]=-(-1)^{x y}[y,x].\\\\ The super Jacobi identity: :(-1)^{xz}[x, [y, z + (-1)^{yx}[y, [z, x + (-1)^{zy}[z, [x, y = 0, where x, y, and z are pure in the Z2-grading. Here, x denotes the degree of x (either 0 or 1). The degree of [x,y] is the sum of degree of x and y modulo 2. One also sometimes adds the axioms [x,x]=0 for x = 0 (if 2 is invertible this follows automatically) and = 1 (if 3 is invertible this follows automatically). When the ground ring is the integers or the Lie superalgebra is a free module, these conditions are equivalent to the condition that the Poincar√©‚ÄìBirkhoff‚ÄìWitt theorem holds (and, in general, they are necessary conditions for the theorem to hold). Just as for Lie algebras, the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra can be given a Hopf algebra structure. A graded Lie algebra (say, graded by Z or N) that is anticommutative and Jacobi in the graded sense also has a Z_2 grading (which is called \\"rolling up\\" the algebra into odd and even parts), but is not referred to as \\"super\\". See note at graded Lie algebra for discussion.  Properties  Let \\\\mathfrak g = \\\\mathfrak g_0 \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak g_1 be a Lie superalgebra. By inspecting the Jacobi identity, one sees that there are eight cases depending on whether arguments are even or odd. These fall into four classes, indexed by the number of odd elements: # No odd elements. The statement is just that \\\\mathfrak g_0 is an ordinary Lie algebra. # One odd element. Then \\\\mathfrak g_1 is a \\\\mathfrak g_0-module for the action \\\\mathrm{ad}_a: b \\\\rightarrow [a, b], \\\\quad a \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g_0, \\\\quad b, [a, b] \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g_1. # Two odd elements. The Jacobi identity says that the bracket \\\\mathfrak g_1 \\\\otimes \\\\mathfrak g_1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak g_0 is a symmetric \\\\mathfrak g_1-map. # Three odd elements. For all b \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g_1, [b,[b,b = 0. Thus the even subalgebra \\\\mathfrak g_0 of a Lie superalgebra forms a (normal) Lie algebra as all the signs disappear, and the superbracket becomes a normal Lie bracket, while \\\\mathfrak g_1 is a linear representation of \\\\mathfrak g_0, and there exists a symmetric \\\\mathfrak g_0-equivariant linear map \\\\\\\\{\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\}:\\\\mathfrak g_1\\\\otimes \\\\mathfrak g_1\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak g_0 such that, :[\\\\left\\\\\\\\{x, y\\\\right\\\\\\\\},z]+[\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y, z\\\\right\\\\\\\\},x]+[\\\\left\\\\\\\\{z, x\\\\right\\\\\\\\},y]=0, \\\\quad x,y, z \\\\in \\\\mathfrak g_1. Conditions (1)-(3) are linear and can all be understood in terms of ordinary Lie algebras. Condition (4) is nonlinear, and is the most difficult one to verify when constructing a Lie superalgebra starting from an ordinary Lie algebra (\\\\mathfrak g_0) and a representation (\\\\mathfrak g_1). Involution A ‚àó Lie superalgebra is a complex Lie superalgebra equipped with an involutive antilinear map from itself to itself which respects the Z2 grading and satisfies [x,y]* = [y*,x*] for all x and y in the Lie superalgebra. (Some authors prefer the convention [x,y]* = (‚àí1)xy[y*,x*]; changing * to ‚àí* switches between the two conventions.) Its universal enveloping algebra would be an ordinary *-algebra. Examples Given any associative superalgebra A one can define the supercommutator on homogeneous elements by :[x,y] = xy - (-1)^{xy}yx\\\\ and then extending by linearity to all elements. The algebra A together with the supercommutator then becomes a Lie superalgebra. The simplest example of this procedure is perhaps when A is the space of all linear functions \\\\mathbf {End}(V) of a super vector space V to itself. When V = \\\\mathbb K^{pq}, this space is denoted by M^{pq} or M(pq). With the Lie bracket per above, the space is denoted \\\\mathfrak {gl}(pq). The Whitehead product on homotopy groups gives many examples of Lie superalgebras over the integers. Classification The simple complex finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras were classified by Victor Kac. The basic classical compact Lie superalgebras (that are not Lie algebras) are: SU(m/n) These are the superunitary Lie algebras which have invariants: : z.\\\\overline{z}+iw.\\\\overline{w} This gives two orthosymplectic (see below) invariants if we take the m z variables and n w variables to be non- commutative and we take the real and imaginary parts. Therefore, we have :SU(m/n)=OSp(2m/2n)\\\\cap OSp(2n/2m) SU(n/n)/U(1) A special case of the superunitary Lie algebras where we remove one U(1) generator to make the algebra simple. OSp(m/2n) These are the orthosymplectic groups. They have invariants given by: :x.x+y.z-z.y for m commutative variables (x) and n pairs of anti-commutative variables (y,z). They are important symmetries in supergravity theories. D(2/1;\\\\alpha) This is a set of superalgebras parameterised by the variable \\\\alpha. It has dimension 17 and is a sub-algebra of OSp(98). The even part of the group is O(3)√óO(3)√óO(3). So the invariants are: :A_\\\\mu A_\\\\mu+B_\\\\mu B_\\\\mu+C_\\\\mu C_\\\\mu +\\\\psi^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}\\\\psi^{\\\\alpha' \\\\beta' \\\\gamma'}\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\alpha \\\\alpha'}\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\beta \\\\beta'}\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\gamma \\\\gamma'} : A_{\\\\\\\\{1} A_2 A_{3\\\\\\\\}} + B_{\\\\\\\\{1} B_2 B_{3\\\\\\\\}} + C_{\\\\\\\\{1} C_2 C_{3\\\\\\\\}} + A_\\\\mu \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha \\\\alpha'}_\\\\mu \\\\psi\\\\psi + B_\\\\mu \\\\Gamma^{\\\\beta \\\\beta'}_\\\\mu \\\\psi\\\\psi + C_\\\\mu \\\\Gamma^{\\\\gamma \\\\gamma'}_\\\\mu \\\\psi\\\\psi for particular constants \\\\gamma. F(4) This exceptional Lie superalgebra has dimension 40 and is a sub- algebra of OSp(2416). The even part of the group is O(3)xSO(7) so three invariants are: :B_{\\\\mu u} + B_{ u \\\\mu} = 0 :A_\\\\mu A_\\\\mu + B_{\\\\mu u}B_{\\\\mu u} + \\\\psi_{\\\\\\\\{1}^\\\\alpha \\\\psi_{2\\\\\\\\}}^\\\\alpha :A_{\\\\\\\\{1} A_2 A_{3\\\\\\\\}} + B_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu u} B_{ u \\\\tau} B_{\\\\tau \\\\mu\\\\\\\\}} + B_{\\\\mu u} \\\\sigma_{\\\\mu u}^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\psi^\\\\alpha_k \\\\psi^\\\\beta_k + A_\\\\mu \\\\Gamma_\\\\mu^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} \\\\psi^k_\\\\alpha \\\\psi^k_\\\\beta + (\\\\text{sym.}) This group is related to the octonions by considering the 16 component spinors as two component octonion spinors and the gamma matrices acting on the upper indices as unit octonions. We then have f^{\\\\mu u \\\\tau}\\\\sigma_{ u \\\\tau} \\\\equiv \\\\gamma_\\\\mu where f is the structure constants of octonion multiplication. G(3) This exceptional Lie superalgebra has dimension 31 and is a sub-algebra of OSp(1714). The even part of the group is O(3)√óG2.

Seized vessels and cargo were sold at auction, with the corsair captain entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Although not French Navy personnel, corsairs were considered legitimate combatants in France (and allied nations), provided the commanding officer of the vessel was in possession of a valid letter of marque ( or , the latter giving corsairs their name), and the officers and crew conducted themselves according to contemporary admiralty law. By acting on behalf of the French Crown, if captured by the enemy, they could in principle claim treatment as prisoners of war, instead of being considered pirates. Because corsairs gained a swashbuckling reputation, the word \\"corsair\\" is also used generically as a more romantic or flamboyant way of referring to privateers, or even to pirates. The Barbary pirates of North Africa as well as the Ottoman Empire were sometimes called \\"Turkish corsairs\\". Etymology The word \\"corsair\\" comes directly from the French word corsaire, itself borrowed from the Italian corsaro. This derives from the Latin cursus, meaning \\"course\\" (as in journey or expedition).Dictionnaire de L'Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, 9e edition en ligne The French word corsaire may have originated as a mispronunciation of the Arabic word qar·π£an; the term pirate had been in use in French since the Middle Ages. However, Sayyid SulaimƒÅn Nadvƒ´, an Indian Muslim scholar of Islamic studies, says that \\"Qarsan ... is the arabicised form of 'Corsair'.\\" History French corsairs with booty and British prisoners in 1806, depicted in a later painting by Maurice Orange. The corsairs were privateers working for the King of France attacking the ships of France's enemies. In France they did not need to fear punishment for piracy--being hanged--as they were granted a licence as combatants, the lettre de marque or lettre de course, a document which legitimised their actions to the French justice system and which they hoped gave them the status of a war prisoner in case they were ever captured. The corsair was ordered to attack only the ships of enemy countries, theoretically respecting those of neutral nations and his own nations. If he did not respect this rule, he was then treated as a pirate and hanged. The corsairs' activities also provided the King with revenue as the licence required them to hand over a part of their booty to the King. In common with privateers of other nationalities, however, they were often considered pirates by their foreign opponents, and might be hanged as pirates if captured by the foreigners they preyed on. The \\"corsair\\" activities started in the Middle Ages the main goals really being to compensate for the economic problems in war periods; and the ship owners did not accept that the war was an obstacle to their trade. Jean de Ch√¢tillon, who was a bishop, in 1144 gave the town of Saint-Malo the status of rights of asylum which encouraged all manner of thieves and rogues to move there. Their motto was \\"Neither Breton, nor French, but from Saint-Malo am I!\\". Saint-Malo, however, progressed and in 1308 the town was made into a free commune to encourage the commercial activities of craftsmen as well as merchants and ship owners. This did not really work out and later in 1395 the town became a free port. This situation continued until 1688. Between the early 1500s and 1713 when the signing of the treaty of Utrecht effectively put an end to the French corsair raids in the Caribbean, the guerre de course, as the French called it, took a huge toll on the Spanish treasure fleet's efforts to ship the gold and silver from Peru to Santo Domingo and Havana and then on to Spain. During this period, there was an intense drive to improve, not only the speed of the ships involved in this contest, but also their maneuverability and ability to sail into the wind (the close haul). It was a matter of life or death, and immense wealth was at stake. Jean d'Ango, father and son, came to be among the wealthiest and most influential men in France. In addition to those listed below, Giovanni da Verrazzano (namesake of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge) and Jean Fleury were among the principals in this era. The activities of the corsairs were so profitable that the Minister of the Navy used this in his strategy to make money. Moreover, the King used to take one-quarter or even one-third of the booty. The corsairs' activities weakened France's enemies; indeed, English trade losses were very important from 1688 to 1717. In a note based on an examination of Lloyd's List from 1793 to 1800, the anonymous author showed that British shipping losses to captures exceeded those resulting from the perils of the sea.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, p. 369. > Losses to capture: 4314; recaptured 705; Net ‚Äì 3639 > Perils of the sea: 2385 plus 652 driven on shore, of which 70 recovered; > Net ‚Äì 2967. The relationship between the corsairs and the State changed as the power of the State grew. The rules became stricter and State control more and more present. At the end of the 18th century, the \\"course\\" started to decline until its legal death in 1856. The \\"course\\" disappeared in France with the Empire in 1804, but was officially ended only by the 1814 Treaty of Paris, where every major northern hemisphere nation except Spain, Mexico, and the United States, was present, and the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Famous corsairs =Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau= Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau (1774‚Äìc.1813), was a Breton who commanded a number of privateers, most notably Blonde, and Duc de Dantzig. In them he captured numerous prizes. He and Duc de Dantzig disappeared without a trace around the end of 1812. Their disappearance gave rise to an unsubstantiated gruesome ghost ship legend. =Jean-Fran√ßois Roberval= Jean-Fran√ßois de La Roque de Roberval (c. 1500‚Äì1560) was a Protestant French nobleman and adventurer who, through his lifelong friendship with King Francis, became the first Lieutenant General of New France. As a corsair, he attacked towns and shipping throughout the Spanish Main, from Cuba to Colombia. When his appointment as the first Lieutenant General of New France did not work out, he attempted to repay his debts through privateering. The Spanish Caribbean was his main target, since at that time France and Spain were at war. Known to the Spanish as Roberto Baal,Gerassi-Navarro, Nina (1999) Pirate Novels: Fictions of Nation Building in Spanish America Duke University Press, Durham, p. 22, discussing real pirates; in 1543 he sacked Rancherias and Santa Marta, followed by an attack in 1544 on Cartagena de Indias. In 1546, ships under his command attacked Baracoa and Havana. The next year, he retired from pirating. He died a Huguenot martyr. =Ren√© Duguay-Trouin= Ren√© Duguay-Trouin was born in Saint-Malo in 1673, and the son of a rich ship owner took a fleet of 64 ships and was honoured in 1709 for capturing more than 300 merchant ships and 20 warships. He had a brilliant privateering and naval career and eventually became \\"Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies of the King\\", i.e., admiral, (French:Lieutenant-G√©n√©ral des arm√©es navales du roi), and a Commander in the Order of Saint-Louis. He died peacefully in 1736. =Robert Surcouf= Robert Surcouf was the last and best-known corsair of the Saint- Malo. Born there in 1773, his father was a ship owner and his mother the daughter of a captain. Ship's boy at 13 and corsair captain at 22 years old, and then -- very much against his licence -- for several years attacked ships including those of the French East India Company, or Compagnie Fran√ßaise des Indes. During the French Revolution, the convention government disapproved of lettres de course, so Surcouf operated at great personal risk as a pirate against British shipping to India. Surcouf was so successful that he became a popular celebrity in France. After a brief early retirement Surcouf again operated against shipping to the Indies. Surcouf became a ship owner himself and died in Saint-Malo in 1827. There is a statue of him on public display there, and his house is now a small museum. =Jean Bart= Jean Bart (21 October 1650 ‚Äì 27 April 1702) was a French naval commander and privateer. He achieved his greatest successes during the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì1697).

The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific erythropus is from Ancient Greek eruthros, \\"red\\", and pous, \\"foot\\". It breeds across northern Scandinavia and the northern Palearctic and migrates south to the Mediterranean, the southern British Isles, France, tropical Africa, and tropical Asia for the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to Australia and North America. Taxonomy The spotted redshank was described by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Scolopax erythropus. Includes a transcript of the 1764 text. It is a monotypic species, with no recognised subspecies. Taxonomically, it forms a close-knit group with several other large Tringa species, with molecular sequencing showing it to be a sister clade to that containing the greater yellowlegs and the common greenshank. Description This is a large wader (shorebird), measuring long, with a wingspan of and a weight ranging from . It is black in breeding plumage, and very pale in winter. It has a red legs and bill, and shows a white oval on the back in flight. Juveniles are grey-brown finely speckled white above, and have pale, finely barred underparts. Adults moult completely between July and October. In spring, the body plumage is moulted between March and May. Juveniles have a partial moult between August and February.RSPB Handbook of British Birds (2014). UK . The call is a creaking whistle teu-it (somewhat similar to the call of a roseate tern), the alarm call a kyip-kyip-kyip.

The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific nebularia is from Latin nebula \\"mist\\". Like the Norwegian Skoddefoll, this refers to the greenshank's damp marshy habitat. Relatives Its closest relative is the greater yellowlegs, which together with the spotted redshank form a close-knit group. Among them, these three species show all the basic leg and foot colours found in the shanks, demonstrating that this character is paraphyletic. They are also the largest shanks apart from the willet, which is altogether more robustly built. The greater yellowlegs and the common greenshank share a coarse, dark, and fairly crisp breast pattern as well as much black on the shoulders and back in breeding plumage. Distribution This is a subarctic bird, breeding from northern Scotland eastwards across northern Europe and east across the Palearctic. It is a migratory species, wintering in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Australasia, usually on fresh water. It breeds on dry ground near marshy areas, laying about four eggs in a ground scrape. Description Common greenshanks are brown in breeding plumage, and grey-brown in winter. When in water, they can appear very similar to marsh sandpipers but are distinguished by the shape of the lower bill which gives it an upturned appearance to the bill. They have long greenish legs and a long bill with a grey base. They show a white wedge on the back in flight. They are somewhat larger than the related common redshank. The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as teu-teu-teu. Like most waders, they feed on small invertebrates, but will also take small fish and amphibians.

Rone was not an accomplished boxer: He lost 26 professional bouts in a row before dying. (A \\"journeyman\\" in boxing parlance is someone hired, often on short notice, to fight against up and coming prospects or championship contenders. Very often, these journeymen have negative win-loss records.) Rone died after a fight with Billy Zumbrun, a boxer who had beaten Rone before, and who had become friends with Rone after their first fight. Rone had been banned from fighting in Nevada for three years. Although he lived in Las Vegas, commissioner Marc Ratner, considered one of the most serious and respected figures in boxing, felt Rone was in risk of getting injured every time he boxed, so he denied the Ohio native a license in 2000. Rone then took to the road to find fights, going as far as Germany and Denmark. Despite being banned from Nevada, he fought several times in California, as well as in Idaho and Texas. His fights with Zumbrun were in Utah. Usually, when a boxer is banned from fighting in one state of the United States, the suspension carries over to the other states, but in Rone's case, he still managed to get fights on U.S. soil. On July 17, Rone's mother died of a heart attack. Seemingly out of money to fly to Ohio, Rone was offered a fight with Zumbrun in Utah the following day, for a fee of 800 dollars. He accepted, and drove to Utah for the fight. Rone was hit by a Zumbrun jab just before the bell to end the first round. He turned around to walk to his corner when he collapsed, dying instantly. A ringside doctor tried to revive him using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but his efforts were in vain. An autopsy later revealed Rone had died of a heart attack instead of as a consequence of the punch inflicted by Zumbrun. Various theories have been formed after his death: Rone was a large, man who might have inherited a heart condition from his mother. He was distraught by her death and might have been under pressure and distress before the fight. Since he had a losing streak of 26 bouts in a row, the theory that he might have taken too much punishment inside a ring is also credible. Former commissioner Ratner himself said that he would not have allowed Rone to fight. Moreover, Arizona senator John McCain expressed his feeling that Rone's death showed that a unified national boxing commission was needed, one which would verify boxers' records and whether they are banned from one state or not. Rone's opponent, Zumbrun, told friends that Rone lacked his usual strength.

Engraving in 1718 edition of William Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum Hugh d'Avranches ( ‚Äì 27 July 1101), nicknamed le Gros (the Fat) or Lupus (the Wolf), was the second Norman Earl of Chester* 3) and one of the great magnates of early Norman England. Early life and career Hugh d'Avranches was born around 1047 as the son of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. His mother was previously identified as Emma de Conteville; however, C.P. Lewis, author of Hugh's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, states that the identification was made \\"on the basis of unsatisfactory evidence\\" and that his mother is unknown. Earl of Chester Hugh was given the command of Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire after Duke William became William I of England. In 1071, Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester was taken prisoner at the Battle of Cassel in France. Taking advantage of the circumstances, the king declared his title vacant, giving Hugh the earldom. The new Earl was also given palatine powers in view of Cheshire's strategic location on the Welsh Marches. On Hugh's promotion, Tutbury and its surrounding lands were passed to the Norman Knight, Henry de Ferrers. After his father's death, as late as 1082, Hugh succeeded his father as Viscount of Avranches, and inherited large estates, not just in the Avranchin but scattered throughout western Normandy. The earl regarded St Anselm his friend and, during his lifetime, founded the Benedictine Abbeys of Sainte-Marie-et-Saint-Sever, Saint-Sever-Calvados, Normandy and St. Werburgh in Chester as well as giving land endowments to Whitby Abbey, North Yorkshire. Hugh remained loyal to King William II during the rebellion of 1088. He later served Henry I as one of his principal councillors at the royal court. Wales Hugh spent much of his time fighting with his neighbours in Wales. Together with his cousin Robert of Rhuddlan he subdued a good part of northern Wales. Initially Robert of Rhuddlan held north-east Wales as a vassal of the tenant-in-chief. In 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd was captured through the treachery of one of his own men at a meeting near Corwen. Gruffudd was imprisoned by Earl Hugh in his castle at Chester, but it was Robert who took over his kingdom, holding it directly en liege from the king. When Robert was killed by a Welsh raiding party in 1093 Hugh took over these lands, becoming ruler of most of North Wales, but he lost Anglesey and much of the rest of Gwynedd in the Welsh revolt of 1094, led by Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had escaped from captivity. Norwegian invasion In the summer of 1098 Hugh joined forces with Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, in an attempt to recover his losses in Gwynedd. Gruffudd ap Cynan had retreated to Anglesey, but then was forced to flee to Ireland when a fleet he had hired from the Danish settlement in Ireland changed sides. Things were altered by the arrival of a Norwegian fleet under the command of King Magnus III of Norway, also known as Magnus Barefoot, who attacked the Norman forces near the eastern end of the Menai Straits. Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury was killed by an arrow said to have been shot by Magnus himself. The Normans were obliged to evacuate Anglesey altogether leaving Gruffydd who had returned from Ireland to take possession the following year. Hugh apparently made an agreement with him and did not again try to recover these lands. Marriage, death and succession Owing to his gluttony, Hugh became so fat that he could hardly walk, earning him the nickname of le Gros (the Fat). He would also earn the nickname Lupus (Wolf) for his savage ferocity in battle against the Welsh, after he was dead. Hugh d'Avranches married Ermentrude of Claremont, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, by whom he had his son and heir, Richard d'Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester, who died in the White Ship disaster of 1120. He received many of the local manors held by Edwin the last Saxon Earl of Mercia (died 1071). Edwin was the grandson of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. Leofric had been a holder of the Saxon title \\"Earl of Chester\\". Hugh fell ill and became a monk in July 1101. He died four days later and was buried in the cemetery of St. Werburgh. He was succeeded as Earl of Chester by his son Richard, who married Matilda of Blois, a granddaughter of William the Conqueror. Both Richard and Matilda died in the White Ship disaster (1120), and Richard was then succeeded by Hugh's nephew Ranulph le Meschin, Earl of Chester, son of his sister Margaret by her husband Ranulf de Briquessart, Viscount of Bayeux.

The kingdom of the Ganda people, Buganda is the largest of the traditional kingdoms in present-day East Africa, consisting of Uganda's Central Region, including the Ugandan capital Kampala. The 6 million Baganda (singular Muganda; often referred to simply by the root word and adjective, Ganda) make up the largest Ugandan ethnic group, representing approximately 16.9% of Uganda's population. Buganda has a long and extensive history. Unified in the 13th century (1300AD) under the first king Kato Kintu, the founder of Buganda's Kintu Dynasty, Buganda grew to become one of the largest and most powerful states in East Africa during the eighteenth and 19th centuries. Before the 12th century, the present day Buganda region was a kingdom known as Muwaawa, which means a sparsely populated place. During the Scramble for Africa, and following unsuccessful attempts to retain its independence against British imperialism, Buganda became the centre of the Uganda Protectorate in 1894; the name Uganda, the Swahili term for Buganda, was adopted by British officials. Under British rule, many Baganda acquired status as colonial administrators, and Buganda became a major producer of cotton and coffee. Following Uganda's independence in 1962, the kingdom was abolished by Uganda's first Prime Minister Milton Obote in 1966. Following years of disturbance under Obote and dictator Idi Amin, as well as several years of internal divisions among Uganda's ruling National Resistance Movement under Yoweri Museveni, the President of Uganda since 1986, the kingdom was officially restored in 1993. Buganda is now a traditional kingdom and thus occupies a largely ceremonial role. Since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993, the king of Buganda, known as the Kabaka, has been Muwenda Mutebi II. He is recognised as the 36th Kabaka of Buganda. The current queen, known as the Nnabagereka, is Queen Sylvia Nagginda. Location Buganda's boundaries are marked by Lake Victoria to the south, the River Nile to the east, Lake Kyoga to the north and River Kafu to the northwest. Language The Luganda language is widely spoken in Uganda and is the most popular language in Uganda along with English. Luganda is also widely spoken in and around other countries in East Africa. In kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Even in South Sudan where it is used mostly by business people, transacting business in South Sudan. Luganda is the most spoken local language in Uganda. Despite all efforts made by different governments to weaken the language, it has survived and still growing. Local languages like Luganda need to be protected and promoted than weakening them. In literature and common discourse, Buganda is often referred to as Central Uganda. Geography and environment Ganda villages, sometimes as large as forty to fifty homes, were generally located on hillsides, leaving hilltops and swampy lowlands uninhabited, to be used for crops or pastures. Early Ganda villages surrounded the home of a chief or headman, which provided a common meeting ground for members of the village. The chief collected tribute from his subjects, provided tribute to the Kabaka, who was the ruler of the kingdom, distributed resources among his subjects, maintained order, and reinforced social solidarity through his decision-making skills. During the late 19th century, Ganda villages became more dispersed as the role of the chiefs diminished in response to political turmoil, population migration, and occasional popular revolts.  Government  Kabaka Palace in Kampala Buganda is a constitutional monarchy. The current Head of State is the Kabaka, Muwenda Mutebi II who has reigned since the restoration of the kingdom in 1993. The Head of Government is the Katikkiro (Prime Minister) Charles Mayiga, who was appointed by the Kabaka in 2013. The Parliament of Buganda is the Lukiiko. Prior to the Buganda Agreement of 1900, Buganda was an almost absolute monarchy. Under the Kabaka, there were three types of chief: ' (administrative) chiefs, who were appointed directly by the Kabaka; traditional ' chieftains; and ' chiefs, who served as representatives of the Kabaka, charged with \\"maintaining internal security, supervising royal estates and military duties\\". The 1900 agreement, however, greatly enhanced the power of the Lukiiko (which had previously been simply an advisory council) at the expense of the Kabaka. While Buganda retained self- government, as one part of the larger Uganda Protectorate, it would henceforth be subject to formal British overrule. The Buganda Agreement of 1955 continued the transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy. During Uganda independence, the constitutional position of Buganda (and the degree to which it would be able to exercise self-government) was a major issue. Discussions as part of the Uganda Relationships Commission resulted in the Buganda Agreement of 1961 and the first Constitution of Uganda (1962), as part of which Buganda would be able to exercise a high degree of autonomy. This position was reversed during 1966‚Äì67, however, before the Kabakaship and Lukiiko were disestablished altogether in 1967 before being restored in 1993. History Before the arrival of Europeans in the region, Buganda was an expanding, \\"embryonic empire\\". It built fleets of war canoes from the 1840s to take control of Lake Victoria and the surrounding regions, and subjugated several weaker peoples. These subject peoples were then exploited for cheap labor. The first Europeans to enter the Kingdom of Buganda were British explorers John Hanning Speke and Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton while searching for the headwaters of the Nile in 1862. They found a highly organized political system which was marred, however, by the ongoing practice of mass human sacrifice estimated at 800 persons annually. The explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley visited Buganda in 1875 and provided an estimate of Buganda troop strength. Stanley counted 3,000 troops and a fleet of war canoes. At Buganda's capital, Lubaga, Stanley found a well-ordered town surrounding the king's palace, which was situated atop a commanding hill. A tall cane fence surrounded the palace compound, which was filled with grass- roofed houses, meeting halls, and storage buildings. Thronging the grounds were foreign ambassadors. seeking audiences, chiefs going to the royal advisory council, messengers running errands, and a corps of young pages. He estimated the population of the kingdom at 2,000,000Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, While in exile, Mwanga II was received into the Anglican Church, was baptized with the name of Danieri (Daniel). He spent the rest of his life in exile. He died in 1903, aged 35 years. In 1910 his remains were repatriated and buried at Kasubi. =Attempted secession in Kayunga= In September 2009, some members of the minority Banyala ethnic group led by a recently Retired UPDF Captain Isabanyala Baker Kimeze announced that Bugerere had seceded from the Kingdom of Buganda. The Banyala make up 0.09% of the population of Uganda and 13% of the population of the district, Kayunga, that in their opinion they were leading into secession. Because of the resulting tensions, the government of Uganda stopped the Kabaka of Buganda from traveling to Bugerere, leading to riots in the capital Kampala and neighboring districts. Thirty were killed in what came to be known as the Buganda riots.Kampala hit by renewed violence, BBC, 2009-09-11 Demographics A blind Buganda harpist c. 1911 =Clans of Buganda= As of 2009, there were at least 52 recognised clans within the kingdom, with at least another four making a claim to clan status. Within this group of clans, there are four distinct sub-groups, which reflect historical waves of immigration to Buganda.Kyazze, Jones Yosia: The Ganda Clan System Nansangwa The oldest clans trace their lineage to Bakiranze Kivebulaya, who are supposed to have ruled in the region from about 400 AD until about 1300 AD. These seven clans are referred to as the Nansangwa, or the indigenous: # Lugave (Pangolin) # Mmamba (Lungfish) # Ngeye (Colobus monkey) # Njaza (Reedbuck) # Ennyange (Cattle egret) # Fumbe (Civet cat) # Ngonge (Otter) # Mpindi (Cowpea) # Ngabi (bushbuck) Kintu migration The Abalasangeye dynasty came to power through the conquests of Kabaka Kato Kintu, which are estimated to have occurred sometime between 1200 and 1400 AD. Thirteen clans that are believed to have come with Kintu: # Ekkobe (Liana fruit) # Mbwa (Dog) # Mpeewo (Oribi antelope) # Mpologoma (Lion) # Namu≈ãoona (Pied crow) # Ngo (Leopard) # ≈äonge (Otter) # Njovu (Elephant) # Nkejje (Cichlids) # Nkima (Vervet monkey) # Ntalaganya (Blue duiker) # Nvubu (Hippopotamus) # Nvuma (Pearl) The descendants of the Basimba people (also known as Bashimba) which is a Bisa and Ambo nickname of the Clan of the leopards, the bena Ngo in Zambia, who settled at Mpogo, Sironko District, are among the Ngo Clan group that come along with Kabaka Kato Kintu in his immigration. Kimera migration Around 1370 AD another wave of immigration assisted by Kabaka Kimera, who was the son of Omulangira Kalemeera. Kabaka Kimera was born in Kibulala, and returned to Buganda with Jjumba of the Nkima clan and other Buganda elders. These eleven clans are: # Bugeme # Butiko (Mushrooms) # Kasimba (Genet) # Kayozi (Jerboa) # Kibe (Fox) # Mbogo (Buffalo) # Musu/Omusu (Edible rat) # Ngabi (Bushbuck) # Nkerebwe (Jungle Shrew) # Nsuma (snout fish) # Nseenene (Copiphorini) Economy The traditional Ganda economy relied on crop cultivation. In contrast with many other East African economic systems, cattle played only a minor role. Many Baganda hired laborers from outside Buganda to herd the Baganda's cattle, for those who owned livestock. Bananas were the most important staple food, providing the economic base for the region's dense population growth. This crop does not require shifting cultivation or bush fallowing to maintain soil fertility, and as a result, Ganda villages were quite permanent. Women did most of the agricultural work, while men often engaged in commerce and politics (and in precolonial times, warfare). Before the introduction of woven cloth, traditional clothing was manufactured from the bark of trees.

She was the most prominent woman in Georgia in the Progressive Era, and was honored by appointment to the Senate. She was sworn in on November 21, 1922, and served just 24 hours. At 87 years, nine months, and 22 days old, she was the oldest freshman senator to enter the Senate. She was the only woman to have served as a Senator from Georgia until the 2020 appointment of Kelly Loeffler. Her husband William Harrell Felton was a member of the United States House of Representatives and Georgia House of Representatives and she ran his campaigns. She was a prominent society woman; an advocate of prison reform, women's suffrage and educational modernization; a white supremacist and slave owner; and a woman who spoke vigorously in favor of lynching. Numan Bartley wrote that by 1915 she \\"was championing a lengthy feminist program that ranged from prohibition to equal pay for equal work.\\"Numan Bartley, The Creation of Modern Georgia (1983) p 121 Early life  Felton was born in Decatur, Georgia, on June 10, 1835. She was the daughter of Charles Latimer, a prosperous planter, merchant, general store owner. Charles was a Maryland native who moved to DeKalb County in the 1820s, and his wife, Eleanor Swift Latimer, was from Morgan, Georgia. Felton was the oldest of four children; her sister, Mary Latimer, also became prominent in women's reforms in the early 20th century. When she was 15, her father sent her to live with relatives in the town of Madison where she attended a private school within a local Presbyterian church. She then went on to attend Madison Female College, from which she received a classical liberal arts education. She graduated at the top of her class at age 17 in 1852. In October 1853, she married Dr. William Harrell Felton at her home and moved to live with him on his plantation just north of Cartersville, Georgia. She gave birth to five children, one daughter and four sons. Only one, Howard Erwin Felton, survived childhood. In the aftermath of the Civil War, their plantation was destroyed. Because they were now unable to rely on slave labor as a means of producing income, Dr. Felton returned to farming as a way to earn income until there was enough money to open a school. Felton and her husband opened Felton Academy in Cartersville, where she and her husband both taught. Women's suffrage  By joining the Women's Christian Temperance Union in 1886, Rebecca Latimer Felton was able to achieve stature as a speaker for equal rights for white women. Upon her entrance into the public realm independent of her husband's political career in the late 19th century, Felton attempted to employ elite men to help elite women achieve equal status in society. She believed that it was necessary for men to be held accountable, and during her 1887 address at the Women's Christian Temperance Union state convention, she argued that women were actively fulfilling their duties as wives and mothers, but men undervalued their importance. She argued that women should have more power inside of the home with more influence on the decision making process, proper education should be provided for both wives and daughters, women should have economic independence through this education, training, and later employment and women should have more influence over the children. In 1898, Felton wrote \\"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\\" as an attempt to convince Georgia legislators that education for girls was necessary. In this article, she argued that it was a man's responsibility to take care of his wife and children. Therefore, it was his responsibility to ensure his daughter had equal rights and opportunities to his sons.Mrs. W.H. Felton. \\"Textile Education for Georgia Girls\\", in Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscript Library, UGA, Manuscript Collection 81 However, this strategy was not working and in 1900 Felton officially joined the Women's Suffrage Movement. This move led her to work tirelessly for white women's rights, including the right to vote, the Progressive Movement, free public education for women, and admittance into public universities. A prominent activist for women's suffrage in Georgia, Felton found many opponents in anti-suffragist Georgians such as Mildred Lewis Rutherford. During a 1915 debate with Rutherford and other anti-suffragists before the Georgia legislative committee, the chairman allowed each of the anti-suffragists to speak for 45 minutes but demanded Felton stop speaking after 30 minutes. Felton ignored him and spoke for an extra 15 minutes, at one point making fun of Rutherford and implicitly accusing her of hypocrisy. However, the Georgia legislative committee did not pass the suffrage bill. Georgia was later the first state to reject the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it was proposed in 1919, and unlike most other states in the Union, Georgia did not allow women to vote in the 1920 presidential election. Women in Georgia were not given the right to vote until 1922. Felton criticized what she saw as the hypocrisy of Southern men who boasted of superior Southern \\"chivalry\\" but opposed women's rights, and she expressed her dislike of the fact that Southern states resisted white women's suffrage longer than other regions of the US. She wrote, in 1915, that women were denied fair political participation > except in the States which have been franchised by the good sense and common > honesty of the men of those States‚Äîafter due consideration, and with the > chivalric instinct that differentiates the coarse brutal male from the > gentlemen of our nation. Shall the men of the South be less generous, less > chivalrous? They have given the Southern women more praise than the man of > the West‚Äîbut judged by their actions Southern men have been less sincere. > Honeyed phrases are pleasant to listen to, but the sensible women of our > country would prefer more substantial gifts. ...Cornerstones of Georgia > History, p. 168 Racial views After she was married at age eighteen, Felton and her husband owned slaves before the Civil War, and she was the last member of either house of Congress to have been a slave owner. On August 11, 1898, Felton delivered a speech asserting that, given the inability of the church or courts to protect white women from \\"the ravening human beasts‚Äîthen I say lynch; a thousand times a week if necessary.\\" The Weekly Star reprinted Holman's Atlanta Journal article. Speech was on August 11, 1898. Felton's speech was the subject of Alexander Manly's August 18 Daily Record rebuttal editorial The Weekly Star reprinted Manly's August 18, 1898 editorial from The Daily Record. that in turn was used as a pretext for the Wilmington insurrection of November 1898. Felton was a white supremacist. She claimed, for instance, that the more money that Georgia spent on black education, the more crimes blacks committed.Litwack, p. 100 For the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition, she \\"proposed a southern exhibit 'illustrating the slave period,' with a cabin and 'real colored folks making mats, shuck collars, and baskets‚Äîa woman to spin and card cotton‚Äîand another to play banjo and show the actual life of [the] slave‚Äînot the Uncle Tom sort.'\\" She wanted to display \\"the ignorant contented darky‚Äîas distinguished from Harriet Beecher Stowe's monstrosities.\\" Felton considered \\"young blacks\\" who sought equal treatment \\"half-civilized gorillas\\", and ascribed to them a \\"brutal lust\\" for white women.Litwack, p. 213 While seeking suffrage for women, she decried voting rights for blacks, arguing that it led directly to the rape of white women.Litwack, p. 221 Felton also advocated more lynchings of black men, saying that such was \\"elysian\\" compared to the rape of white women.Litwack, pp. 304, 313 On August 11, 1898, Felton gave a speech in Tybee, Georgia, to several hundred members of the Georgia State Agricultural Society. She urged an increase in lynchings in order to protect rural white women from being raped by black men. Newspapers reprinted a transcript of Felton's speech to garner support for the Democratic Party. On August 18, 1898, Alex Manly's Daily Record printed a rebuttal editorial arguing that white rape of black women was much more frequent, and contact between white women and black men is often consensual. Manly's editorial was used as a pretext for the Wilmington Insurrection of November 1898. Manly was interviewed by the Baltimore Sun three days after the massacre, and he stated that he only had wished to defend \\"defamed colored men\\" libeled by Felton. He said that his editorial had been distorted by white newspapers. Felton's response appeared in the November 16 issue of the Raleigh News and Observer: \\"When the negro Manly attributed the crime to intimacy between negro men and white women of the South the slanderer should be made to fear a lyncher's rope rather than occupy a place in New York newspapers.\\"Zucchino, pp. 83-84, 87-89, 280-281 In 1899, a massive crowd of white Georgians tortured, mutilated, and burned a black man, Sam Hose, who purportedly had killed a white man in self-defense and was falsely accused by unscrupulous journalists of raping his victim's wife . The crowd sold parts of his physical remains as souvenirs. Felton said that any \\"true-hearted husband or father\\" would have killed \\"the beast\\" and that Hose was due less sympathy than a rabid dog.Litwack, pp. 282‚Äì83 Day as a Senator Felton at her Senate desk In 1922, Governor Thomas W. Hardwick was a candidate for the next general election to the Senate, when Senator Thomas E. Watson died unexpectedly. Seeking an appointee who would not be a competitor in the coming special election to fill the vacant seat and a way to secure the vote of the new women voters alienated by his opposition to the 19th Amendment, Hardwick chose Felton, on October 3, to serve as senator. Congress was not expected to reconvene until after the election, so the chances were slim that Felton would be sworn in. However, Walter F. George won the special election despite Hardwick's ploy. Rather than take his seat immediately when the Senate reconvened on November 21, George allowed Felton to be sworn in. This was due in part to persuasion by Felton and a supportive campaign launched by the white women of Georgia. Felton benefited as a well-known and respected representative of the suffrage movement when politicians desired to enhance their standings with the newly acquired women voters by means of a symbolic gesture. Felton thus became the first woman senator, and served until George took office one day later. Final years After dedicating over five decades to white women's suffrage, Felton returned to Cartersville and continued to write and lecture until her final days, finishing her book The Romantic Story of Georgia's Women only shortly before her death. She died in Atlanta, in 1930. Her remains were interred in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Cartersville.

Gassier.Laurent Martin Le Canard encha√Æn√© Flammarion, 2001 It changed its title briefly after World War I to Le Canard D√©cha√Æn√© (\\"The duck unbound\\", or \\"out of control\\"), to celebrate the end of military censorship of the press. It resumed the title Le Canard encha√Æn√© in 1920. The title also conveys a double meaning, \\"canard\\" being a possible salacious rumour or whisper and \\"encha√Æn√©\\" simply meaning linked, hence \\"the inside whisper\\". It continued to publish and grow in popularity and influence until it was forced to suspend publication during the German occupation of France in 1940. After the liberation of France, it resumed publication. It changed to its eight-page format in the 1960s. Many of the Canard's early contributors were members of the Communist and Socialist parties, but it shed its alignment with those groups in the 1920s. Its current owners are not tied to any political or economic group. It now avoids any political alignment, and has gained a reputation for publishing incriminating stories and criticizing any political party with no preference. It is also fairly anti-clerical and lampoons the nobility. The Canard does not accept any advertisements. In the 1920s, it used to advertise for free Le Crapouillot, another satirical magazine created by Jean Galtier-Boissi√®re, a friend of Maurice Mar√©chal. Similarly, Le Crapouillot carried free advertisements for the Canard. Relations between the two magazines soured during the Spanish Civil War as Mar√©chal supported the Spanish Republican government of Madrid, whilst Galtier-Boissi√®re remained strictly pacifist. The Canard and its format served as an inspiration for the satirical weekly magazine El Be Negre, published in Barcelona between 1931 and 1936.El be negre (1931‚Äì1936) ‚Äì La Ciberniz =Typical format= The pages of the Canard are peppered with satirical cartoons. Here, Ren√© P√©tillon mocks wealthy businesspeople who place both their production and their capital offshore. The Canard has a fixed eight-page layout. Pages 1, 2‚Äì4 and 8 are mostly news and editorials. Page 2 carries anecdotes from the political and business world. Pages 5‚Äì7 are dedicated to social issues (such as the environment), profiles, general humour and satire, and literary, theatre, opera and film criticism. One section, called l'Album de la Comtesse, is dedicated to spoonerisms. The Canard is notable because of its focus on scandals in French governmental and business circles, although it does also cover other countries. Although they became more aggressive during Fran√ßois Mitterrand's presidency, major French newspapers are traditionally reluctant to challenge government corruption or pursue embarrassing scandals (the rationale being that revealing political or business scandals only profits extremists on the far-left or far-right); hence, the Canard fills that gap. The Canard publishes insider knowledge on politicians and leaks from administration officials, including information from whistle-blowers. Generally, the Canard is well informed about happenings within the world of French politics. Its revelations have sometimes brought about the resignation of cabinet ministers. Some of the information published by the Canard clearly comes from very well-placed sources, who are likely to include ministerial aides. Charles de Gaulle was a frequent target, and was known to ask, \\"What does the bird have to say?\\" (Que dit le volatile?) every Wednesday ‚Äì the day Canard would roll off the presses. There are often verbatim and off-the-record quotes from major politicians, including the president and prime minister, usually aimed at another politician. The paper's international coverage has been pretty spotty, though it has improved. It relies mostly on leaks from French government services and reports from the other media. It also publishes satirical cartoons and jokes. The factual and jocular columns are cleanly delineated. =Regular features= Every issue includes short political news (Mare au Canards); weekly profile (Prises de Bec); news from the media world; sections of press clippings (typos and malapropisms found in the French press) Rue des petites perles and √Ä travers la presse d√©cha√Æn√©e; the section which highlights the two most absurd or incomprehensible sentences of the week by politicians, respectively hanging them up on the mur du √ßon or awarding them the noix d'honneur; as well as its Sur l'Album de la Comtesse section of comic, cryptic spoonerisms. Some features are recurring but not present in every issue, such as bogus humorous interviews (interviews (presque) imaginaires) which have been copied by many others. Across the years, it also included recurring features focusing on one or more personalities of the day. Notably during the 1960s, Andr√© Ribaud and the cartoonist Moisan created a series, La Cour, which was a parody of Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon's Memoirs on the Reign of Louis XIV. Charles de Gaulle was turned into the king, and the deputies and the senators into courtiers. Thus, in La Cour, Fran√ßois Mitterrand became the ever-scheming count of Ch√¢teau-Chinon. In La Cour, the king would address his subjects by means of the √©tranges lucarnes (strange windows), a phrase de Gaulle had employed about television. After the death of de Gaulle, La Cour became La R√©gence with Georges Pompidou being the regent. This followed the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, which also extend into the Regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans that followed the death of Louis XIV. After the death of Georges Pompidou, La R√©gence was stopped. Later long-running features include comical imaginary diaries such as the Journal de Xavi√®re T. (following allegations of fake work done by Xavi√®re Tiberi, wife of the then mayor of Paris); the Journal de Carla B. (describing Carla Bruni's bohemian- bourgeois reactions towards events involving her husband, then President Nicolas Sarkozy); the Journal de Penelope F. (in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election and following allegations of fake work by Penelope Fillon, wife of the Les R√©publicains candidate Fran√ßois Fillon). The Canard also reports on topics affecting the general population: scandals in industries (workforce, safety issues), miscarriages of justice, misconduct in public administrations and services... =Argot= As with the British satirical magazine Private Eye, it has its own language, jargon and style. In particular, it has nicknames for politicians and personalities. Some examples include: * Charles de Gaulle: Mong√©n√©ral, Badingaulle (after 13 May 1958, an allusion to Napol√©on III) * Fran√ßois Mitterrand: Tonton [Uncle] (the codename used by the French Secret Service in charge of his protection) * Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing: Valy, L'Ex (after 1981) * Raymond Barre: Babarre * Michel Debr√©: L'amer Michel [Bitter Michael] (from the popular rhyme La M√®re Michel [Mother Michael]) * Michel Rocard: Hamster Jovial (an allusion to a comic by Marcel Gotlib in reference to his past as a scout) * Robert Hersant: Le Papivore (a reference to the many papers that he bought) * Christian Estrosi: Le Motodidacte (a reference to his past in motorbike racing) * Jean-Pierre Raffarin: Le Ph√©nix du Haut-Poitou (from his region of origin) * Jacques Chirac: Chichi, Le Chi * Bernadette Chirac: Bernie *Nicolas Sarkozy: Sarkol√©on (A portmanteau of Sarkozy with Napol√©on), Le petit Nicolas (title of a popular series of children's books) *Fran√ßois Hollande: Monsieur Royal (a reference to his one-time life-partner S√©gol√®ne Royal), the pedalo captain *Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement: Le Che Staff , the publisher of the Canard was Michel Gaillard, and the head editors were Claude Angeli and Erik Emptaz. The Canard's cartoonists include: * Andr√© Escaro * Ren√© P√©tillon * Jacques-Armand Cardon * Lefred Thouron * Delambre * Kerleroux * Carlos Brito * Wozniak * Guiraud * Ghertman * Pancho Past cartoonists included: * Cabu, whose Beauf character was featured in a weekly strip. * Jean Effel * Moisan * Jacques Lap It also publishes a quarterly magazine, Les Dossiers du Canard, dedicated to one subject, usually one affecting French society, or world events as seen from a French perspective. Scandals related to Le Canard encha√Æn√© =\\"Plumbers' affair\\"= On 3 December 1973, policemen of the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DST), disguised as plumbers, were caught trying to install a spy microphone in the directorial office of Le Canard. The resulting scandal forced Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin to leave the government, though it is said that Marcellin was a scapegoat for other members of the government, especially the Defense Minister, who was intent on knowing the identities of informers for the newspaper. =Robert Boulin affair= A series of articles accusing long-serving Gaullist minister and possible Prime Ministerial candidate Robert Boulin of involvement in dubious real estate deals was followed by Boulin's mysterious death (October 1979), presumed to be suicide. Following his death, major officials publicly accused Le Canard encha√Æn√© of the moral responsibility for Boulin's death, and there were broad hints the government might use the reaction to the Boulin death to seek stricter libel laws, as was done in the 1930s after the suicide of Roger Salengro. Jacques Chaban-Delmas, then President of the National Assembly, who had been politically identified with Boulin for many years, told a special memorial session of the assembly that it should \\"draw the lessons of this tragedy, of this assassination\\". After meeting with President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Prime Minister Raymond Barre called for \\"meditation upon the consequences of certain ignominies\\", and spoke of \\"a baseness\\". President Giscard d'Estaing also added to the criticism: Boulin, he said, \\"was unable to resist the campaign of harassment he was subjected to. Public opinion should severely condemn any other similar campaigns.\\" Famous investigations * Marthe Hanau affair (1928) * Albert Oustric affair (1930) * Stavisky Affair (1934) * Cardinal Jean Dani√©lou's death in the house of a prostitute (1974) * Bokassa's diamonds (1980s) * The Canard fought to bring to light evidence of alleged corruption during President Jacques Chirac's tenure as mayor of Paris.

Ownership The Canard is published by Les √âditions Mar√©chal-Le Canard encha√Æn√© (Maurice and Jeanne Mar√©chal founded the Canard), which is privately owned; the main associates are Michel Gaillard (CEO and director of publication), Andr√© Escaro, Nicolas Brimo, Erik Emptaz and employees of the newspaper. Because it does not accept advertisements (being free of sponsors), being entirely privately owned (being the same,) and because its publishing costs are met by its sales, Le Canard Encha√Æn√© is considered one of (if not the) most objective French publications‚Äîhence its continued existence. It has a limited web presence, dependent, as it is, on selling a printed product. Business Despite declining newspaper circulations in France, and elsewhere, Canard is rich and growing. It owns cash reserves and property holdings worth 110 million euros. It runs cheaply and profitably, restricting itself to eight pages of two-color newsprint each week. Circulation has risen by a third since 2007 and its scandal-fuelled growth has seen a rise to 700,000 copies being printed and sold each week. Its net profit in 2009 was 5 million euros. In popular culture  * In the film L'Arm√©e des Ombres, directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, the character Luc Jardie (played by Paul Meurisse), while in London during the German occupation of France during World War II, imagines that his fellow countrymen will be truly liberated when they can see American films and once more read Le Canard encha√Æn√©, alluding to the censorship of the Vichy Regime. * In the TV film Notable donc coupable (2007) (translation: Well-to-do, hence guilty), the fictional weekly Le Canardeur is modelled after Le Canard encha√Æn√©.

By attending the laboring mother, the doulas can assist the midwives and make the birth easier. The midwives monitor the labor, and well-being of the mother and fetus during birth. Should additional medical assistance be required the mother can be transferred to a hospital. Some hospitals are now adding birth centers to their facilities as an alternative to the high tech maternity wards commonly found at most hospitals. A birth center presents a more home-like environment than a hospital labor ward, typically with more options during labor: food/drink, music, and the attendance of family and friends if desired. Other characteristics can also include non-institutional furniture such as queen-sized beds, large enough for both mother and father and perhaps birthing tubs or showers for water births. The decor is meant to emphasize the normality of birth. In a birth center, women are free to act more spontaneously during their birth, such as squatting, walking or performing other postures that assist in labor. Active birth is encouraged. The length of stay after a birth is shorter at a birth center; sometimes just 6 hours after birth the mother and infant can go home. Hospital birth comparison A 2012 Cochrane review compared traditional hospital births with alternative, home-like settings in or near conventional hospital labor wards. In comparison with traditional hospital wards, home-like settings had a trend towards an increase in spontaneous vaginal birth, continued breastfeeding at six to eight weeks, and a positive view of care. The review also found that having a birth at an alternative birth center decreased the likelihood of medical intervention during labor, without increasing risk to mother or child. Birth centers in the United States Like clinics, birth centers arose on the coasts of the U.S. in the 1970s, as alternatives to heavily institutionalized health care. Today, use of birthing centers is generally covered by health insurance. Several of the practices which were innovated in birth centers are beginning to enter the mainstream hospital labor and delivery floors including: * Bathtubs or whirlpools for labor and/or birthing * Showers for mothers to labor in * Hospital acceptance of the mother choosing to walk during labor, use a labor/birthing ball, not use pain medication during labor and rooming in of the infant after birth * Beds for family members to stay with the mother during labor and birth There are certain requirements that a woman needs to meet in order to be able to birth at a birth center. First, the mother must have an uncomplicated, low- risk pregnancy, such as a singleton pregnancy (no twins) and that the baby is positioned head down. Free-standing birth centers require hospital backup in case complications arise during labor that require more complex care. However, even if a delivery can not happen at the birth center due to a high-risk pregnancy, birth center midwives might provide prenatal care up to a certain week of gestation or at the hospital alongside an obstetrician. The nationwide organization supporting and promoting birth centers is the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC). Many birth centers nationwide, like hospitals, chose to become accredited through the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers (CABC).http://www.birthcenteraccreditation.org/ Since 1985, CABC has provided this accreditation service, as well as education and support to birth centers and alongside maternity centers. Some birth centers are required to obtain accreditation in order to apply for state licensure, or to become in-network with certain insurance plans. Many birth centers chose voluntarily to undergo accreditation to demonstrate their commitment to safety and continuous quality improvement. Accreditation depends on a set of measures, called Indicators, against which birth centers are evaluated during site visits by CABC Accreditation Specialists. Adherence to these indicators ensures both safety of mother and infant as well as protects the integrity of the birth center model of care as distinct from hospital care. For example, while continuous fetal monitoring is typical in hospital labor and delivery units, intermittent monitoring with a handheld electronic device is used in birth centers to protect the birthing woman's freedom of mobility during her labor and birth. CABC Indicators also require a birth center to have a written plan for how to proceed with transfer to a hospital in the event of an emergency that cannot be managed at the birth center. The full set of Indicators is available by request from the CABC website at https://www.birthcenteraccreditation.org/go/get-cabc-indicators/. Birth center applications for accreditation are reviewed by Commissioners on the board of trustees of the CABC. These Commissioners are Certified Nurse‚ÄêMidwives, certified professional midwives, physician specialists in obstetrics and neonatology, nurses, and birth center consumers. The Commissioners meet quarterly to review items of concern relevant to birth center education and development and publish a monthly newsletter for CABC-accredited birth centers for continuing education. The CABC works with policy advocacy organizations to advance and promote birth centers and the midwifery model of care. While CABC works closely alongside the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC), the organizations are separate and have distinctly separate roles regarding national standards and accreditation of birth centers. CABC is the only accrediting body devoted exclusively to birth centers, whose site visitors are specifically trained to conduct a site visit in a birth center; and whose review panels have first‚Äêhand knowledge of the philosophy, clinical care and operation of birth centers. AABC on the other hand, is a membership and trade organization for established and developing birth centers and other individuals, agencies and institutions that support the birth center model of care and the national AABC Standards for Birth Centers. There has been much research in recent years to support out of hospital birth‚Äîespecially birth center birth‚Äîas not just safe but at times safer than hospital birth because of its judicious use of technology, licensed professionals and connection to the health care system. =Amish birth centers in the United States= The Amish, known for their great respect for tradition, usually have homebirths or give birth at birthing centers. Most Amish women only go to a hospital to give birth when there is a known medical risk for her or the child, but some Amish women choose to go the hospital during labor for peace of mind. Two books have been written about Amish medical issues including their birthing practices: Dr. Frau: A Woman Doctor among the Amish by Grace Kaiser and House calls and hitching posts: stories from Dr. Elton Lehman's career among the Amish by Elton Lehman. Lehman is known for his work in founding a freestanding Amish birthing center. The Mount Eaton Care Center, Ohio's first such center, was established in 1984. In her book, Kaiser recounts the private nature of birthing among the Amish. She points out the practice of Amish women keeping labor a secret to all except their own husbands and midwife or obstetrician, as well as the practice of women waiting till active labor before summoning a midwife or OB. Due to the latter practice, fathers occasionally end up delivering their own children before the midwife or OB can arrive if a homebirth is selected. Amish women who choose a homebirth often continue with household duties until they are no longer physically able to continue. If birthing in a birth center, they are free to labor similar to that of homebirths: eating, drinking, visiting with their family members, etc. Birth centers in Australia In a response to the National Maternity Action Plan, State and Territory Governments in 2002 started to respond to consumer demand for an increased number of birth centers to be made available to women. Whilst most birth centers are attached to hospitals, some are being established as free-standing centers much further away from hospital back-up. As long as they are within 90 minutes of a hospital, they are considered 'safe'. Most birth centers are now being run solely by midwives, with obstetric back-up only used when there are complications. Some birth centers in Australia are moving away from the 'low-risk' model and are moving to an All risk model where women with medical complications are accepted into the birth center but extra care is provided to them where necessary. Birth centers in Canada Birthing centers remain a controversial issue in Canada, but using one is an option for Canadian women. Hospitals do offer this option, and it is available at special clinics.  Birthing Centers in the Netherlands  The Netherlands has seen a growth in the number of locations for giving birth that fall outside of the traditional methods of giving birth at home or giving birth in an obstetric unit at a hospital. In these facilities the birth is overseen by a midwife, typically in a homelike environment. In the Netherlands, most community midwives work in group practices and only refer patients to hospital obstetric units for labor complications.

Its most notable run was from 1960 to 1967 on CBS. Early life and education Funt was born into a Jewish family in New York City, New York. His father Isidore Funt was a diamond wholesaler, and his mother was Paula Saferstein Funt. Allen graduated from high school at age 15. Too young to attend college on his own, he studied at Pratt Institute (also located in Brooklyn). He later earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Cornell University, studied business administration at Columbia University, then returned to Pratt for additional art instruction. Career =Radio and television= Trained in commercial art, Funt worked for an advertising agency in their art department, but he eventually moved to its radio department. Among his first jobs for radio, he wrote for Truth or Consequences and assisted US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with her radio commentaries. Drafted into the military during World War II and stationed in Oklahoma, Funt served in the Army Signal Corps, eventually making radio shows. He began his signature program on ABC Radio as The Candid Microphone on June 28, 1947, and it ran until September 23, 1948. The program was revived on CBS June 6 ‚Äì August 29, 1950. He soon experimented with a visual version by doing a series of theatrical short films also known as Candid Microphone. These film shorts served as a springboard for his entrance into television on August 10, 1948. The show ran on all three major TV networks and in syndication while hosted by Allen Funt until he was sidelined by a stroke in 1993. The syndicated version of Candid Camera was broadcast from 1974 to 1979; his co- hosts included, at various times, John Bartholomew Tucker, Phyllis George and Jo Ann Pflug. In 1964, Funt appeared as himself in an episode of the situation comedy The New Phil Silvers Show.Classic TV Archive The New Phil Silvers Show (1963-64) =Films= During the 1970s, Funt made two documentary films based on the hidden camera theme: the X-rated What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? (1970) and Money Talks (1972). In the 1980s, Funt produced a series of adult- oriented videos called Candid Candid Camera. =Other pursuits= Funt donated his recordings and films to his alma mater Cornell University and established a fellowship at Syracuse University for postgraduate studies in radio and television \\"aimed at providing the broadcast industry with qualified black personnel.\\" He established a foundation which used laughter therapy for seriously ill patients by providing videocassettes of Candid Camera episodes. He also taught psychology at Monterey Peninsula College. Personal life In 1946, Funt married Evelyn Michal (1920‚Äì2014) with whom he had three children, Peter, Patricia and John. In 1964 the couple was divorced and the same year Funt married Marilyn Laron, whom he divorced in 1978. The couple had two children, Juliet and William. Funt had seven grandchildren. On February 3, 1969, Funt, his wife, and his two youngest children boarded Eastern Airlines Flight 7 in Newark, New Jersey with a destination of Miami, Florida. While en route, two men hijacked the plane and demanded passage to Cuba. However, some of the passengers, having spotted Funt, believed the whole thing to be a Candid Camera stunt. Funt repeatedly attempted to persuade his fellow passengers as to the reality of the hijacking, but to no avail. The plane later landed in Cuba, finally convincing the passengers. Funt and others were later released after 11 hours of being held captive.https://dangerousminds.net/comments/youre_not_on_candid_camera_allen_funt_was_on_hijacked_flight He amassed a collection of works by the Victorian painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema and engineered an exhibition of them at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (bypassing the wishes of then director Thomas Hoving). The collection's value skyrocketed as a result, and Funt sold them at a handsome profit. Funt resided in Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York. His estate, White Gates, was sold to opera singer Jessye Norman in the early 1990s. Funt in the early 1970s purchased a 1,226 acre ranch located south of Carmel near Big Sur, California, \\"where he raised Hereford cattle and quarter horses\\" Funt later purchased the nearby 11-acre Bixby Ranch where he resided. Both ranches were eventually bought by The Trust for Public Land which expected to turn the land over to the US Forest Service. After a stroke in 1993, he became incapacitated and died in 1999 in Pebble Beach, California, 11 days before his 85th birthday. Candid Camera continued with his son, Peter Funt, as host.

Career =Involvement with Candid Camera= Candid Camera first aired in 1948 and was created by Peter Funt's father, Allen. Peter first appeared on Candid Camera at age 3, posing as a shoeshine boy who charged ten dollars per shoe. He joined the show professionally in 1987 when he became a co-host with his father. During this time the show was being broadcast on the CBS television network. In 1993, Allen Funt had a serious stroke, from which he never fully recovered. This required Peter to host the show full-time. Later in 1996, he hosted and was the executive producer of the Candid Camera 50th anniversary special.Gerard, Jeremy. Candid Camera's 50th Anniversary. TV Reviews. August 26, 1996-September 1, 1996 The show returned in 1996 for the revamped version of Candid Camera. In 1997, Peter co-hosted the show with Suzanne Somers. In 2001, the show moved to the PAX network and Peter then co-hosted the show with Dina Eastwood until 2004, and began another revival of the show in 2014 with Mayim Bialik. During his time on the show Peter was a producer, host and acted on the show. He also produced and hosted over 200 episodes. In 2001, Philip Zelnick, a Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport passenger claimed that he was injured during one of the sequences on the show. Funt posed as an airport security guard and had passengers go through a fake x-ray machine. During the skit, Zelnick received a bruise on his thigh when getting off a conveyor belt. Zelnick sued Funt and the show and won the case, but when Funt appealed, the matter was settled out of court. The Mojave County Airport Authority settled during the trial and paid Zelnick $95,000. PAX TV also gave him $7,500 out of court. =Career after Candid Camera= Following his work with Candid Camera, Funt has written frequent op-eds for many nationally recognized news outlets including The New York Times, USA Today, as well as The Wall Street Journal.\\"http://www.candidcamera.com/cc2/cc2b.html\\"> Candid Camera: Peter Funt. In these articles he offered observations and opinions about television and film. His essay about the evolution of television was later included in ‚ÄúThe Story of American Business,‚Äù which was published in 2009 by the Harvard Business Press. He also has a weekly column distributed by the Cagle Syndicate. In addition to developing new \\"Candid Camera\\" shows, Funt performs a live tribute stage show, \\"Candid Camera's Lol Tour,\\" in theaters across the U.S. Funt will frequently use clips from his time on Candid Camera to give a visual to the point he is trying to convey. He used both his speaking ability and his clips in publishing two business training videos, entitled \\"Too Close to the Customer\\" and \\"Expect the Unexpected\\". Both of these are still marketed frequently throughout the business community. His current presentation to business groups is called \\"The Candid You\\". In addition to his publishing career, Funt is also the founder of the Monterey County Young Journalists program in California. The program offers hands-on training for high school students to help pursue their journalism goals. He has also inaugurated the Courtroom Journalism in Monterey County, as well as a statewide event for the Constitutional Right Foundation in Los Angeles. =Laughter Therapy Foundation= Funt has followed in his father's footsteps by taking over as President of the Laughter Therapy Foundation. Started in 1982 by Allen Funt, the foundation uses the immense comedic library of Candid Camera to send special tapes to terminally ill people throughout the country. Personal life In 1986, Peter Funt married Amy Suzanne Meltzer. He has two children.

Gulf and Western's origins date to a manufacturer named the Michigan Bumper Company founded in 1934, although Charles Bluhdorn treated his 1958 takeover (of what was then Michigan Plating and Stamping) as its \\"founding\\" for the purpose of later anniversaries. Through asset management, the company's non-publishing and entertainment assets were dismantled; with the company re-branding as Paramount Communications in 1989 after Paramount Pictures. The company's current remnants operate as ViacomCBS.  History  =Bluhdorn period= Under Bluhdorn the company diversified widely, leaving behind such things as stamping metal bumpers for a variety of businesses, including financial services, manufacturing, apparel and home, consumer and agricultural, auto parts, natural resources and building products, entertainment and publishing. A partial list of Gulf and Western's holdings between 1958 and 1982, with year of acquisition in parentheses: * APS Holding Corp., auto parts manufacturer * Paramount Pictures (1968) * New Jersey Zinc (1966) * Universal American, including Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation subsidiary (1966) * Taylor Forge (1967) * South Puerto Rico Sugar Company (1967), a holding company in Jersey City, New Jersey, with principal subsidiary, also called South Porto Rico Sugar Company, a cane sugar refiner in Ensenada, Gu√°nica County, Puerto Rico owners of Central Guanica, purported to once be the largest cane sugar refinery in the world. * The Associates First Capital Corporation, a financial services company (1968) * Consolidated Cigars (1968) * Stax Records (1968) * Sega (1969) * Kayser-Roth (1975), a clothing company that owned the Miss Universe pageant because it had bought Pacific Mills, which had invented the pageant to sell its Catalina Swimwear brand * Simon & Schuster (1975) * Madison Square Garden and by extension the New York Rangers and New York Knicks (1977) * Simmons Bedding Company (1979) * Thomas Ryder and Son, of Bolton, a machine tool manufacturing company, acquired from Whitecroft (1981) With the Paramount acquisition, Gulf and Western became parent company of the Dot Records label and the Famous Music publishing company. After Stax was acquired, that label became a subsidiary of Dot, although Dot was not at all mentioned on the label (rather, Dot and Stax were noted as subsidiaries of Paramount). Later on, the record operation was moved under Famous Music and renamed the Famous Music Group. In 1967, the company also purchased Lucille Ball's Desilu Productions library, which included most of her television product, as well as such properties as Star Trek and Mission: Impossible, both of which would rank amongst its most profitable commodities over the years. Desilu was renamed Paramount Television. Gulf and Western sold Stax back to its original owners in 1970, and with it the rights to all Stax recordings not owned by Atlantic Records. A year before, Dot's non‚Äìcountry music roster and catalog was moved to a newly created label, Paramount Records (the name was previously used by a label unrelated to the film studio; Paramount acquired the rights to that name in order to launch this label). It assumed Dot's status as the flagship label of Paramount's record operations, releasing music by pop artists and soundtracks from Paramount's films and television series. Dot meanwhile became a country label. Famous Music provided distribution for several independent labels, such as Neighborhood Records and Sire Records. Famous began distributing yet another independent label, Blue Thumb Records, in 1971, before buying it outright in 1972. In 1974, Gulf and Western sold the entire record operation to the American Broadcasting Company, which continued the Dot and Blue Thumb imprints as subsidiaries of ABC Records, while discontinuing the Paramount label altogether. While working for Paramount, Barry Diller had proposed a \\"fourth network\\", but he could not convince the board of trustees/directors of the wisdom of this idea. Fox owner News Corporation was, however, interested in starting a network. =Early 1980s= On June 5, 1980, Gulf and Western unveiled an electric car, powered by a zinc chloride battery that would hold a charge for several hours and permit speeds of up to . By year's end, however, the U.S. Department of Energy (which had invested $15 million in the project) reported that the battery had 65% less power than predicted and could be recharged only by highly trained personnel. In 1981, former officials of Gulf and Western's Natural Resources Division led a buyout of New Jersey Zinc and made it a subsidiary of Horsehead Industries, Inc. In 1983 Bluhdorn died of a heart attack on a plane en route home from Dominican Republic to New York headquarters, and the board bypassed president Jim Judelson and named senior vice president Martin S. Davis, who had come up through Paramount Pictures, as the new chief executive officer. =Martin Davis restructuring= Davis slimmed down the company's wilder diversifications and focused it on entertainment, and sold all of its non-entertainment and publishing assets. In 1983, Gulf and Western sold Consolidated Cigar Corporation to five of its senior managers. Also in 1983, Gulf and Western sold the U.S. assets of Sega to pinball manufacturer Bally Manufacturing. The Japanese assets of Sega were purchased by a group of investors led by David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama. In 1984, Gulf and Western divested itself of its many Taylor Forge operations to private owners. Taylor Forge's Somerville, New Jersey plant became Taylor Forge Stainless, while its facilities in Paola, Kansas and Greeley, Kansas became Taylor Forge Engineered Systems. South Puerto Rico Sugar Co. (renamed) was sold to an investment group including The Fanjul Brothers in 1984. In 1985, APS auto parts, Kayser-Roth clothing and Simmons Bedding were sold to the Wickes Companies. The company, thus restructured, subsequently renamed itself Paramount Communications in 1989, and promptly sold The Associates to the Ford Motor Company. = Headquarters = Prior to 1970, the headquarters was on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The Gulf and Western Building (15 Columbus Circle in Manhattan) by Thomas E. Stanley, was built in 1970 for the Gulf and Western company north of Columbus Circle, at the south-western corner of Central Park. The building occupies a narrow block between Broadway and Central Park West and, at , it commands the dramatic view to the north, as well as its immediate surroundings. The top of the building sported a restaurant, The Top of the Park, which was never a full success even though run by Stuart Levin, famous for the Four Seasons, Le Pavillon, and other \\"shrines of haute cuisine,\\" and it being graced with Levin's own elegant signature sculpture by Jim Gary, \\"Universal Woman.\\" Similarly, the cinema space in the basement named Paramount after the picture company that Gulf and Western owned was closed as the building was sold. Problems with the 45-story building's structural frame gave it unwanted fame as its base was scaffolded for years and the upper floors were prone to sway excessively on windy days, even leading to cases of nausea akin to motion sickness. The 1997 renovation into a hotel and residential building, the Trump International Hotel and Tower (One Central Park West), by Costas Kondylis and Philip Johnson involved extensive renovation of both interior and facades. For example, the 45 stories of the original office tower were converted into a 52-story residential building, enabled by the lower ceiling height of residential spaces. The facade was converted with the addition of dark glass walls with distinctive shiny steel framing.  Famous Music  * Gulf and Western owned Famous Music, a music publishing company, through Paramount Pictures. The music publishing company was created in 1928 by Famous-Lasky Corp., Paramount's predecessor. * Viacom sold Famous Music in 2007 to Sony/ATV Music Publishing, LLC.

Early life D√∂beln at Jutas by Albert Edelfelt. Georg Carl was born at the Stora Torpa manor in Segerstads parish in V√§sterg√∂tland (now Falk√∂ping Municipality) to Johan Jakob von D√∂beln and Anna Maria Lindgren. When von D√∂beln was eight years old his father died and he was put in school by relatives with the aim of him becoming a priest. The boy however, showed affinity for a military life and he was enrolled at the Karlskrona naval academy in 1773. Upon graduating as an officer in 1775, he was directed by the family towards a career in law. Disliking this, he sought employment as a junior officer in 1778. Military career As a lieutenant, D√∂beln took part in Gustav III's Russian War and was shot in the head at the Battle of Porrassalmi. The wound did not heal properly and he was forced to wear a black silken bandanna for the rest of his life. During the operation he stayed awake and wrote about it while looking at the whole process with the help of a mirror. He then rapidly advanced to colonel and took part in the Finnish War. On 13 September 1808, he led the Swedish troops in the Battle of Jutas. For this, he would become legendary as the main hero of the war. His reputation was further enhanced when Johan Ludvig Runeberg wrote his epic D√∂beln at Jutas in the Finnish National Poem F√§nrik St√•ls S√§gner (in Swedish). He successfully led the Swedish retreat from the √Öland islands over the frozen Baltic sea. Having re-organized his troops, he engaged Russian forces which ultimately stopped a planned attack on the Swedish capital, Stockholm. D√∂beln was the commanding officer of the North Army on 8 October 1809, when the last formal ties between Sweden and Finland were cut through the dismissal of the last Swedish-Finnish army in the church park of Ume√• in V√§sterbotten North Sweden. D√∂beln's final orders to the parading army, issued verbally prior to dismissal, is considered to be the very essence of rhetoric in Swedish, and has been taught to generations of school-children. In the Second War against Napoleon he led troops in Swedish Pomerania and sent troops to relieve Hamburg, which was besieged by the French, without authorisation. For this, he was court-martialled and sentenced to be executed. However, he was pardoned by Crown Prince Charles John, later crowned Charles XIV John of Sweden. Personal life He was married to Kristina Karolina Ullstr√∂m (they later divorced). The couple had one son, Napoleon (1802‚Äì1847). Although popular, having had a great career and after his death considered a war hero, von D√∂beln lived his last years impoverished. D√∂belns Park in central Ume√• in northern Sweden is the oldest park in Ume√•. It came to be named after D√∂beln when his monument was placed in the park in 1867. There is also a smaller park called \\"D√∂belns plan\\" in the same city.D√∂belns plan, umea.se, retrieved 27 May 2014 References  *D√∂beln, Georg Carl von, in Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon, Herman Hofberg (ed.), Stockholm : Albert Bonniers f√∂rlag, 1906. 1758 births 1820 deaths People from Falk√∂ping Municipality Swedish nobility Swedish people of German descent Swedish military personnel of the Finnish War Swedish generals Swedish prisoners sentenced to death Prisoners sentenced to death by Sweden Recipients of Swedish royal pardons Recipients of the Order of the Sword Swedish military commanders of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Georg Carl von D√∂beln"},{"id":"297595","text":"The absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) is the minimum sound level of a pure tone that an average human ear with normal hearing can hear with no other sound present. The absolute threshold relates to the sound that can just be heard by the organism.Durrant J D., Lovrinic J H. 1984. Bases of Hearing Sciences. Second Edition. United States of America: Williams & WilkinsGelfand S A., 2004. Hearing an Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics. Fourth edition. United States of America: Marcel Dekker The absolute threshold is not a discrete point, and is therefore classed as the point at which a sound elicits a response a specified percentage of the time. This is also known as the auditory threshold. The threshold of hearing is generally reported as the RMS sound pressure of 20 micropascals, i.e. 0 dB SPL, corresponding to a sound intensity of 0.98 pW/m2 at 1 atmosphere and 25 ¬∞C.RMS sound pressure p can be converted to plane wave sound intensity using I=\\\\frac{p^2}{\\\\rho v}, where œÅ is the density of air and v is the speed of sound It is approximately the quietest sound a young human with undamaged hearing can detect at 1,000 Hz.Gelfand, S A., 1990. Hearing: An introduction to psychological and physiological acoustics. 2nd edition. New York and Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc. The threshold of hearing is frequency-dependent and it has been shown that the ear's sensitivity is best at frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 kHz, where the threshold reaches as low as ‚àí9 dB SPL. Thresholds of hearing for male (M) and female (W) subjects between the ages of 20 and 60  Psychophysical methods for measuring thresholds  Measurement of the absolute hearing threshold provides some basic information about our auditory system. The tools used to collect such information are called psychophysical methods. Through these, the perception of a physical stimulus (sound) and our psychological response to the sound is measured.Hirsh I J.,1952. \\"The Measurement of Hearing\\". United States of America: McGraw-Hill. Several psychophysical methods can measure absolute threshold. These vary, but certain aspects are identical. Firstly, the test defines the stimulus and specifies the manner in which the subject should respond. The test presents the sound to the listener and manipulates the stimulus level in a predetermined pattern. The absolute threshold is defined statistically, often as an average of all obtained hearing thresholds. Some procedures use a series of trials, with each trial using the 'single-interval \\"yes\\"/\\"no\\" paradigm'. This means that sound may be present or absent in the single interval, and the listener has to say whether he thought the stimulus was there. When the interval does not contain a stimulus, it is called a \\"catch trial\\". = Classical methods = Classical methods date back to the 19th century and were first described by Gustav Theodor Fechner in his work Elements of Psychophysics. Three methods are traditionally used for testing a subject's perception of a stimulus: the method of limits, the method of constant stimuli, and the method of adjustment. ; Method of limits: In the method of limits, the tester controls the level of the stimuli. Single-interval yes/no paradigm' is used, but there are no catch trials. : The trial uses several series of descending and ascending runs. : The trial starts with the descending run, where a stimulus is presented at a level well above the expected threshold. When the subject responds correctly to the stimulus, the level of intensity of the sound is decreased by a specific amount and presented again. The same pattern is repeated until the subject stops responding to the stimuli, at which point the descending run is finished. : In the ascending run, which comes after, the stimulus is first presented well below the threshold and then gradually increased in two decibel (dB) steps until the subject responds. Series of descending and ascending runs in Method of LimitsAs there are no clear margins to 'hearing' and 'not hearing', the threshold for each run is determined as the midpoint between the last audible and first inaudible level. : The subject's absolute hearing threshold is calculated as the mean of all obtained thresholds in both ascending and descending runs. : There are several issues related to the method of limits. First is anticipation, which is caused by the subject's awareness that the turn-points determine a change in response. Anticipation produces better ascending thresholds and worse descending thresholds. : Habituation creates completely opposite effect, and occurs when the subject becomes accustomed to responding either \\"yes\\" in the descending runs and/or \\"no\\" in the ascending runs. For this reason, thresholds are raised in ascending runs and improved in descending runs. : Another problem may be related to step size. Too large a step compromises accuracy of the measurement as the actual threshold may be just between two stimulus levels. : Finally, since the tone is always present, \\"yes\\" is always the correct answer. ; Method of constant stimuli: In the method of constant stimuli, the tester sets the level of stimuli and presents them at completely random order. Subject responding \\"yes\\"/\\"no\\" after each presentation : Thus, there are no ascending or descending trials. : The subject responds \\"yes\\"/\\"no\\" after each presentation. : The stimuli are presented many times at each level and the threshold is defined as the stimulus level at which the subject scored 50% correct. \\"Catch\\" trials may be included in this method. : Method of constant stimuli has several advantages over the method of limits. Firstly, the random order of stimuli means that the correct answer cannot be predicted by the listener. Secondarily, as the tone may be absent (catch trial), \\"yes\\" is not always the correct answer. Finally, catch trials help to detect the amount of a listener's guessing. : The main disadvantage lies in the large number of trials needed to obtain the data, and therefore time required to complete the test. ; Method of adjustment: Method of adjustment shares some features with the method of limits, but differs in others. There are descending and ascending runs and the listener knows that the stimulus is always present. The subject reduces or increase the level of the tone : However, unlike in the method of limits, here the stimulus is controlled by the listener. The subject reduces the level of the tone until it cannot be detected anymore, or increases until it can be heard again. : The stimulus level is varied continuously via a dial and the stimulus level is measured by the tester at the end. The threshold is the mean of the just audible and just inaudible levels. : Also this method can produce several biases. To avoid giving cues about the actual stimulus level, the dial must be unlabeled. Apart from already mentioned anticipation and habituation, stimulus persistence (preservation) could influence the result from the method of adjustment. : In the descending runs, the subject may continue to reduce the level of the sound as if the sound was still audible, even though the stimulus is already well below the actual hearing threshold. : In contrast, in the ascending runs, the subject may have persistence of the absence of the stimulus until the hearing threshold is passed by certain amount.Hirsh I J.,Watson C S., 1996.

Accessed 1 March 2007. = Modified classical methods = = Forced-choice methods = Two intervals are presented to a listener, one with a tone and one without a tone. Listener must decide which interval had the tone in it. The number of the intervals can be increased, but this may cause problems to the listener who has to remember which interval contained the tone.Miller et al., 2002. \\"Nonparametric relationships between single-interval and two-interval forced-choice tasks in the theory of signal detectability\\".

Accessed 1 March 2007. = Adaptive methods = Unlike the classical methods, where the pattern for changing the stimuli is preset, in adaptive methods the subject's response to the previous stimuli determines the level at which a subsequent stimulus is presented.Levitt H., 1971. \\"Transformed up-down methods in psychoacoustics\\". J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 49, 467‚Äì477. Available to download from: http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id;=JASMAN00004900002B000467000001&idtype;=cvips&gifs;=yes. (Accessed 1 March 2007).  Staircase' methods (up-down methods)  Series of descending and ascending trials runs and turning points The simple '1-down-1-up' method consists of series of descending and ascending trials runs and turning points (reversals). The stimulus level is increased if the subject does not respond and decreased when a response occurs. : Similarly, as in the method of limits, the stimuli are adjusted in predetermined steps. After obtaining from six to eight reversals, the first one is discarded and the threshold is defined as the average of the midpoints of the remaining runs. Experiments showed that this method provides only 50% accuracy. : To produce more accurate results, this simple method can be further modified by increasing the size of steps in the descending runs, e.g. '2-down-1-up method', '3-down-1-up methods'. Bekesy's tracking method Bekesy's method contains some aspects of classical methods and staircase methods. The level of the stimulus is automatically varied at a fixed rate. The subject is asked to press a button when the stimulus is detectable. The threshold being tracked by the listener : Once the button is pressed, the level is automatically decreased by the motor-driven attenuator and increased when the button is not pushed. The threshold is thus tracked by the listeners, and calculated as the mean of the midpoints of the runs as recorded by the automat.  Hysteresis effect  Hysteresis can be defined roughly as 'the lagging of an effect behind its cause'. When measuring hearing thresholds it is always easier for the subject to follow a tone that is audible and decreasing in amplitude than to detect a tone that was previously inaudible. This is because 'top-down' influences mean that the subject expects to hear the sound and is, therefore, more motivated with higher levels of concentration. The 'bottom-up' theory explains that unwanted external (from the environment) and internal (e.g., heartbeat) noise results in the subject only responding to the sound if the signal to noise ratio is above a certain point. In practice this means that when measuring threshold with sounds decreasing in amplitude, the point at which the sound becomes inaudible is always lower than the point at which it returns to audibility. This phenomenon is known as the 'hysteresis effect'. Descending runs give better hearing thresholds than ascending runs  Psychometric function of absolute hearing threshold  Psychometric function 'represents the probability of a certain listener's response as a function of the magnitude of the particular sound characteristic being studied'.Arlinger, S. 1991. Manual of Practical Audiometry: Volume 2 (Practical Aspects of Audiology). Chichester: Whurr Publishers. To give an example, this could be the probability curve of the subject detecting a sound being presented as a function of the sound level. When the stimulus is presented to the listener one would expect that the sound would either be audible or inaudible, resulting in a 'doorstep' function. In reality a grey area exists where the listener is uncertain as to whether they have actually heard the sound or not, so their responses are inconsistent, resulting in a psychometric function. The psychometric function is a sigmoid function characterised by being 's' shaped in its graphical representation.  Minimal audible field vs minimal audible pressure  Two methods can be used to measure the minimal audible stimulus and therefore the absolute threshold of hearing. Minimal audible field involves the subject sitting in a sound field and stimulus being presented via a loudspeaker.Kidd G. 2002. Psychoacoustics IN Handbook of Clinical Audiology. Fifth Edition. The sound level is then measured at the position of the subjects head with the subject not in the sound field. Minimal audible pressure involves presenting stimuli via headphones or earphones and measuring sound pressure in the subject's ear canal using a very small probe microphone. The two different methods produce different thresholds and minimal audible field thresholds are often 6 to 10 dB better than minimal audible pressure thresholds. It is thought that this difference is due to: * monaural vs binaural hearing. With minimal audible field both ears are able to detect the stimuli but with minimal audible pressure only one ear is able to detect the stimuli. Binaural hearing is more sensitive than monaural hearing/ * physiological noises heard when ear is occluded by an earphone during minimal audible pressure measurements. When the ear is covered the subject hears body noises, such as heart beat, and these may have a masking effect. Minimal audible field and minimal audible pressure are important when considering calibration issues and they also illustrate that the human hearing is most sensitive in the 2‚Äì5 kHz range.  Temporal summation  Temporal summation is the relationship between stimulus duration and intensity when the presentation time is less than 1 second. Auditory sensitivity changes when the duration of a sound becomes less than 1 second. The threshold intensity decreases by about 10 dB when the duration of a tone burst is increased from 20 to 200 ms. For example, suppose that the quietest sound a subject can hear is 16 dB SPL if the sound is presented at a duration of 200 ms. If the same sound is then presented for a duration of only 20 ms, the quietest sound that can now be heard by the subject goes up to 26 dB SPL. In other words, if a signal is shortened by a factor of 10 then the level of that signal must be increased by as much as 10 dB to be heard by the subject. The ear operates as an energy detector that samples the amount of energy present within a certain time frame. A certain amount of energy is needed within a time frame to reach the threshold. This can be done by using a higher intensity for less time or by using a lower intensity for more time. Sensitivity to sound improves as the signal duration increases up to about 200 to 300 ms, after that the threshold remains constant. The timpani of the ear operates more as a sound pressure sensor. Also a microphone works the same way and is not sensitive to sound intensity.

The Pan-Slavic colors (or colours) ‚Äî red, blue and white ‚Äî were defined by the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848, based on the flag of Russia, which was introduced in the late 17th century. The tricolor flag of Russia was itself inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. Historically, many Slavic nations and states adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors. List of Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include: Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Montenegro, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. On the other hand, Belarus, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine have never adopted all the colors. (The Flag of Poland is red and white, but has different roots that pre-date the pan-Slavic colors.) Yugoslavia, both the Kingdom (Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918‚Äì1943) and the Republic (SFR Yugoslavia, 1943‚Äì1992) was a union of several Slavic nations, and therefore not only sported the pan-Slavic colors but adopted the pan- Slavic flag as its own (later adding a red star). The later Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992‚Äì2003); a federation of Serbia and Montenegro, and its successor state, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (2003‚Äì2006) also used the pan-Slavic flag until the final dissolution of Yugoslavia in 2006. Serbia continues to use a flag with all three Pan-Slavic colors, along with Russia, Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia. The flag of Slovenia was introduced in 1848, when a group of Slovenian intellectuals in Vienna, Austria created the tricolor flag (white-blue-red). Slovakia also has the same tricolor flag design as Slovenia and Russia. The first Slovak flag was also introduced in 1848.

The Catholic Church later recognized these events as \\"worthy of belief\\". A small chapel was built at the site of the apparition, now known as Our Lady of F√°tima, beginning in 1918, and a statue of her installed. The chapel and statue have since been enclosed within the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima, a shrine complex containing two minor basilicas. Associated facilities for pilgrims, including a hotel and medical centre, have also been built over the decades within and around the Sanctuary.

History The name of the town and parish is a rendition of the Arabic given name F√°tima ( ). (Fatimah is the namesake of Fatimah bint Muhammad, a daughter of the prophet of Islam Muhammad.) A close-up of the Christian pilgrims during the Miracle of the Sun on 13 October 1917. An image of the crowd during the last apparition in Cova da Iria. Monument of the Guardian Angel of Portugal apparition to the three little shepherd children of F√°tima. Statue dedicated to the apparition of Our Lady which occurred exceptionally in Valinhos, near the Cova da Iria. F√°tima was said to be the name of a Moorish princess kidnapped by a knight, Gon√ßalo Hermigues, and his companions. Hermigues took her to a small village in the Serra de Aire hills, in the recently created Kingdom of Portugal. According to the Western Catholic narrative, Fatima fell in love with her kidnapper and decided to convert to Christianity in order to marry him. She was baptized and given a Christian name, Oureana. Arab sources, however, claim that F√°tima was forced into Christianity, as were most Reconquista captives. There is no documentary evidence to support either scenario of such a conversion. Whatever version is true, the place name recalls the Princess' original Arab name rather than her Christian baptismal one. The parish was founded in 1568, when it was annexed by the Collegiate of Our√©m (). For centuries, most of the villagers kept herds of sheep and depended also on subsistence farming. Since the early 20th century, F√°tima has been associated with events in which three local children, L√∫cia dos Santos and her cousins, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, purportedly saw visions of a woman known as Our Lady of F√°tima, since believed by the Catholic Church to be the Virgin Mary. On 13 May 1917, whilst guarding their families' sheep in the Cova da Iria, the children first claimed to have seen an apparition of a \\"lady dressed in white\\" and shining with a bright light. The three shepherd children were born in Aljustrel, a small hamlet about from F√°tima. To the west, near Aljustrel, is Loca do Cabe√ßo, a smaller agglomeration of rocky outcroppings where, in 1916, an angel appeared twice to the three children. The children claimed to have seen the Marian apparition on six occasions; they said the last would be 13 October 1917. An estimated 70,000 pilgrims went to the site for the last prophesied apparition in October. Some of them reported what has been referred to as the Miracle of the Sun, when some observers reported it appeared to be behaving unusually. The local bishop investigated the events and determined that the apparitions were worthy of belief. The site was marked by a cross erected by locals. In 1918 they built a small chapel, built from rock and limestone and covered in tile. It was by length, and height. It became a centre for Marian devotion, receiving names such as a f√© de F√°tima, cidade da Paz (\\"the faith of F√°tima, City of Peace\\"), or Terra de Milagres e Apari√ß√µes (\\"Land of Miracles and Apparitions\\"). The chapel has since been enclosed within a large basilica and sanctuary, part of a complex including a hotel and other facilities. In 1930, the statue of Our Lady in the Chapel of Apparitions was crowned by the Vatican. Francisco died in 1919 and Jacinta in 1920, during the international Spanish flu pandemic. Lucia dos Santos became a nun and lived until 2005. The two who died young were beatified on 13 May 2000 by Pope John Paul II, and were canonised by Pope Francis on 13 May 2017, the hundredth anniversary of the first apparition. The construction of the sanctuary and the steady visits by pilgrims stimulated local development. In addition to construction of a large shrine, basilica, and sanctuary, the complex includes a hotel and other facilities. The town of F√°tima was elevated to the status of city on 12 July 1997. In the early 21st century, numerous residents of the parish (primarily from its business sector) worked to have F√°tima designated as an independent municipality. The project, led by J√∫lio Silva, engineer and ex-president of the Junta de Freguesia (Parish Council), was vetoed on July 2003 by President of Portugal Jorge Sampaio. Geography and Climate =Geography= F√°tima is located on the Estremenho Limestone Massif, on the flanks of the Serra de Aire, approximately above sea level. The geology of the Serras de Aire and Candeeiros gives rise to an arid landscape with a rocky ground interspersed with limestone outcroppings. There are various geological formations in the region including sinkholes, uvalas and polje (like the Polje de Minde-Mata), as well as karst grottoes, caves with stalactites and stalagmites, in addition to lapiez fields. The trees in this area are primarily dominated by holly oak (Quercus ilex), Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo), buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis) and olive trees, all of which are resistant to both the winter precipitation extremes and the summer drought . There are also areas of savannah, strips of land bounded by walls of loose stone. Pine and eucalyptus forests are also common in the outskirts of the city. The parish contains the following localities: Aljustrel, Alvaijar, Amoreira, Boleiros, Casa Velha, Casal Farto, Ch√£, Charneca, Cova da Iria, Eira da Pedra, F√°tima, Giesteira, Lombo da √âgua, Maxeira, Moimento, Moita Redonda, Moitas, Montelo, Pederneira, Po√ßo de Soudo, Ramila, Vale de Cavalos and Valinho de F√°tima. Typical landscape =Climate= F√°tima has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb) in transition to a hot-summer (Csa). The climate is characterized by heavy precipitation during the winter, with approximately annually, and warm, dry summers. In the winter temperatures range between at day and at night with January being the coldest month, light frosts are typical during this month. Summer temperatures range between at day and at night. Temperatures can in rare cases reach or more and are often accompanied by low humidity which can sometimes lead to unwanted forest fires around the area. The city has about 2600 hours of annual sunshine. Snow is rare but not uncommon, the last one being in 2016 and 2013 both in 27 February. =Twin towns ‚Äì Sister cities= F√°tima is twinned with: * Czƒôstochowa in Poland * Loreto in Italy * Dro√ü in Austria * Alt√∂tting in Germany * Lourdes in France * Sel√ßuk in Turkey Economy The devotion through Our Lady of F√°tima attracts millions of Christian pilgrims to F√°tima, in Portugal. The economy of the town relies on religious tourism because the world devotion through Our Lady of F√°tima attracts millions of Christian pilgrims. The locals have numerous shops and stalls devoted to the sale of religious articles and souvenirs. In addition, services for tourists, hotels, restaurants and other retail also benefit from the visitors. Other economic activities in the region include: marble sculpturing, saw-milling, carpentry, civil construction, commerce, and services.

Henry Sidney was brought up at court as the companion of Prince Edward, afterwards King Edward VI, and he continued to enjoy the favour of the Crown, serving under Mary I of England and then particularly throughout the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He was instrumental in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland, serving as Lord Deputy three times. His career was controversial both at home and in Ireland. Marriage and family Born to Anne Pakenham (1511 ‚Äì 22 October 1544) and Sir William Sidney of Penshursthttps://www.geni.com/people/Sir-William-Sidney-of- Penshurst/5234689268010064732 (1482 ‚Äì 11 February 1553), Sidney married Mary Dudley, eldest daughter of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, in 1551. They would have three sons and four daughters. His eldest son was Sir Philip Sidney, and his second was Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester. His daughter Mary Sidney married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and by reason of her literary achievements was one of the most celebrated women of her time. Career =First trip to Ireland= In 1556 Sidney served in Ireland with the Lord Deputy, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, who in the previous year had married his sister Frances. Both served Queen Mary until her death in 1558. Sidney played a large part in expanding the English administration in the country, which had shrunk over the centuries to the area around Dublin known as the Pale. He was also involved in the civil and military measures taken by his brother-in-law for bringing Irish chieftains into submission to the English Crown, known as Surrender and Regrant. In the course of the Lord Deputy's expedition to Ulster in 1557 Sidney devastated the island of Rathlin. In the following year, during the absence of Sussex in England, he had sole responsibility for the government of Ireland and conducted himself with marked ability. A second absence of the Lord Deputy from Ireland, on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, threw the chief control into Sidney's hands at the outbreak of trouble with Shane O'Neill, and he displayed great skill in temporising with the chieftain until Sussex reluctantly returned to his duties in August 1559. About the same time Sidney resigned his office of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland on his appointment as president of the council of the Marches in Wales, and for the next few years he resided chiefly at Ludlow Castle, with frequent visits to the court in London. =In Scotland= Queen Elizabeth sent Sidney to Scotland in July 1562. He was instructed to defer a meeting between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots to the next year.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 635. The Scottish queen was unhappy at the news and wept.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 641. While he was with Mary Queen of Scots in the garden of Holyrood Palace there was an embarrassing incident. A Captain Hepburn came up to the queen and handed her a paper while she was talking to Sidney. She passed it to her brother, James Stewart, then Earl of Mar who opened it to discover four stanzas of obscene verse and a pornographic drawing. Meanwhile, Hepburn had fled to England. Mary was particularly affronted that Hepburn's intervention occurred during her meeting with Sidney.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 646-7. =Lord Deputy= Sir Henry Sidney sets out from Dublin Castle. Detail from a plate in The Image of Irelande, by John Derrick (London, 1581). In 1565 Sidney was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in place of Sir Nicholas Arnold, who had succeeded the Earl of Sussex in the previous year. He said he found the English Pale to be in a more impoverished and turbulent condition than when he left it, and claimed the chief disturbing factor to be Shane O'Neill in Ulster. With difficulty he persuaded Elizabeth to sanction vigorous measures against O'Neill; and although the latter avoided a direct encounter, Sidney restored O'Neill's rival Calvagh O'Donnell to his rights, and established an English garrison at Derry to prevent O'Neill expanding his influence.Webb, Alfred. A Compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin, M.H. Gill &vSon;, 1878 In 1567 Shane was murdered by the MacDonnells of Antrim, and Sidney turned his attention to the south, where he arranged the quarrel between Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, and Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, and he executed or imprisoned others he deemed to be disturbers of the peace; then, returning to Ulster, he compelled Turlough Luineach O'Neill, Shane's successor in the chieftainship, to make submission, and placed garrisons at Belfast and Carrickfergus to overawe T√≠r Eoghain and the Glynns. Sidney's time as Lord Deputy is controversial, due to the fact that the government extended its campaign against not only Gaelic military opponents in the field of battle, but also killings against the general population of the peasantry at large. =Desmond Rebellions= In the autumn of 1567 Sidney returned to England, and was absent from Ireland for the next ten months. On his return he urged upon Cecil the necessity for measures to exploit the economic potential of Ireland, to open up the country by the construction of roads and bridges, to replace the Ulster indigenous institutions by a system of freehold land tenure, and to repress the customs prevalent in every part of the island. In 1569, he oversaw the opening of a parliament in Dublin, the first to be held for ten years. He proposed the establishment of the Court of Castle Chamber ‚Äì an Irish version of the Star Chamber ‚Äì which drew the encouragement of the Queen and was established after his recall. Sidney proposed the appointment of a military governor (\\"Lord President\\") in the provinces of Munster and Connacht. This provoked the first of the Desmond Rebellions led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald of the Geraldine family, which had been put down with great severity by 1573. Sidney turned on the Butlers in Ormond and Kilkenny, who had revolted against the opportunistic claims to their lands by Sir Peter Carew, an adventurer from Devon who pursued his entitlement with the blessing of the Dublin government. In 1570 many followers of Sir Edmund Butler were hanged, and three brothers of Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde, were attainted by an act of the Irish parliament. Sidney left Ireland in 1571, aggrieved by the slight appreciation of his statesmanship shown by Queen Elizabeth. In September 1575 he returned with greater royal authority, to find matters in a worse state than before. In Antrim the MacQuillans of the Route and Sorley Boy MacDonnell were the chief fomenters of disorder, and after pacifying this northern territory Sidney repaired to the south, where he was equally successful in making his authority respected. He left his mark on the administrative areas of the island by creating shire divisions on the English model. At an earlier period he had combined the districts of the Ardes and Clandeboye to form the county of Carrickfergus, and had converted the country of the O'Farrells into the County Longford. He then carried out a similar policy in Connacht, where the ancient Irish district of Thomond became County Clare, and the counties of Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon were also delimited. Sidney also suppressed a rebellion headed by the earl of Clanricarde and his sons in 1576, and hunted Rory O'More to his death two years later. Sidney has also been implicated in the infamous massacre of the chiefs of the seven septs of Laois at Mullaghmast in 1578. =The cess controversy= Meantime Sidney's annual levy (the cess), which was designed to fund a central government militia, had caused discontent among the gentry of the Pale, who sent a deputation of eminent barristers to London to carry their grievances in person to Queen Elizabeth. They were supported by several leading figures in the Irish Government, notably the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir William Gerard. Gerard's defection was a bitter blow to Sidney, who for the previous five years had regarded Gerard as his indispensable ally, (\\"my chief counsellor\\"), and the resulting quarrel between the two men weakened Sidney's position. The arguments that the cess policy was mistaken were ultimately successful: greatly to Sidney's chagrin the queen censured his conduct. He was recalled in September 1578, and was coldly received by Elizabeth. =Coat of Arms= Quartered arms of Sir Henry Sidney, KG These arms, which are shown within the Garter in the portrait, are the same as those which appear on Sir Henry's Garter Stall Plate in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. The quarterings are blazoned and identified in 3 D 14,folio 236B. The first is Sidney, the second Clunford, the third Barrington, the fourth Mercy, the fifth Mandeville (the escarbuncle in the portrait is painted in a ghost-like way but it should be black), the sixth Chetwyn, the seventh Belhouse (the lions should be shown between three black cross-croslets), and the eighth Brandon (here the lion's crown should be per pale Gules and Argent). In the portrait, the porcupine in the crest should be blue with gold prickles, collar and line, as should the sinister supporter. The dexter supporter is simply the lion from the Brandon arms and should be so blazoned with a blue collar and line rather than a gold collar and chain.

He was inaugurated upon Shane O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs death, becoming The O'Neill. From 1567 to 1595, Sir Turlough Luineach O'Neill was leader of the O'Neill clan, the most powerful family in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland.Encyclopedia of Tudor England, vol. 1, p. 822. He was knighted in 1578. Birth and ancestry Turlough was born around 1530 at Seanchaisle√°n ('Old Castle'), close to the modern town of Newtownstewart. He was the fourth son of Niall Connallach O'Neill, Tanist of Tyrone (1519‚Äì1544). As Tanist, Niall Connallach was designated to succeed his uncle Conn Bacach (1519‚Äì1559) as The O'Neill. Turlough's mother may have been Niall Connallach's wife, Rose O'Donnell, the daughter of Manus O'Donnell, The O'Donnell of the neighbouring kingdom of Tyrconnell. Turlough was the grandson of Art √≥g macConn, The O'Neill (1513‚Äì1519), and was a direct descendant of Brian macN√©ill Ruad, The O'Neill and ruler of T√≠r Eoghain (1238‚Äì1260). Turlough as O'Neill Making professions of loyalty to the Queen of England in the year following Shane's assassination, Turlough sought to strengthen his position by alliance with the O‚ÄôDonnells, MacDonnells and MacQuillans. But his conduct giving rise to suspicions, an expedition under The 1st Earl of Essex was sent against him, which met with such doubtful success that in 1575 a treaty was arranged by which O‚ÄôNeill received extensive grants of lands and permission to employ three hundred Scottish mercenaries. A further treaty in 1578, negotiated by Lady Agnes, confirmed Turlough‚Äôs vast land holdings in Ulster, granted him a Knighthood and the British titles of Earl of Clanconnell and Baron of Clogher, for life, and allowed him to retain for life the personal army of Scottish mercenaries negotiated three years before. Plate 12 from \\"The Image of Ireland\\". Turlough Lynagh O'Neale and the other kerne kneel to Sir Henry Sidney in submission. In the background Sidney seems to be embracing O'Neale as a noble friend. Still, at the outbreak of rebellion in Munster his attitude again became menacing, and for the next few years he continued to intrigue against the English authorities through clandestine alliances with Spain and Scotland, yet he maintained virtual control of Ulster until 1593, when he was forced by poor health and military setbacks to concede power to his principal rival, Hugh, brother of Brian, whom Turlough had assassinated in 1562 during Shane O‚ÄôNeill's absence at the court of Queen of England. Hugh was recognised by Turlough Luineach as captain of Tyrone, and as his Tanist, in 1593. During summer 1595 Hugh seized the last castle still held by Turlough Luineach, razed it, and drove him into the wilderness. He died between 9 and 12 September 1595, and was buried at Ardstraw, probably at the Franciscan Friary founded by his ancestors. Turlough Luineach had successfully survived as \\"The O'Neill\\" from 1567 until 1595, a turbulent quarter century that saw the most concerted efforts by the English administration to weaken and marginalise his authority in Ulster. He is frequently depicted by contemporary English historians as a weak, drunken buffoon, but his continued survival as the O'Neill through this period speaks of his considerable skill as a ruler and of a sustained policy of successful compromise. Patron of the Arts Turlough Luineach has the distinction of being one of the most highly praised rulers by the Gaelic poets and musicians of his time. His father Niall Connallach had been a celebrated patron of the arts and Turlough Luineach avidly followed his example. He sheltered Uilliam Nuinseann when the poet was accused of conspiracy in the Baltinglass rebellion of 1580. Family His wife, Lady Agnes Campbell, was a daughter of The 3rd Earl of Argyll. One of his daughters was married, as his second wife, to Sorley Boy MacDonnell when he was past the age of eighty years. Another daughter was married to Sir Donnell O'Donnell, a leading figure in Tyrconnell until his death at the Battle of Doire Leathan in 1590. Turlough Luineach's successor was his son Sir Arthur O'Neill, although Sir Arthur did not succeed him as head of the dynasty. During Tyrone's Rebellion, Sir Arthur initially sided with his distant cousin, The 2nd Earl of Tyrone, but then switched sides and served with Sir Henry Docwra's forces out of Derry until his death in 1600. Sir Arthur was then succeeded by his own son, Turlough O'Neill.

During the Roman Republic it was a small, silver coin issued only on rare occasions. During the Roman Empire it was a large brass coin. The name sestertius means \\"two and one half\\", referring to its nominal value of two and a half asses (a bronze Roman coin, singular as), a value that was useful for commerce because it was one quarter of a denarius, a coin worth ten asses. The name is derived from semis, \\"half\\" and \\"tertius\\", \\"third\\", in which \\"third\\" refers to the third as: the sestertius was worth two full asses and half of a third. English-language sources routinely use the original Latin form sestertius, plural sestertii; but older literature frequently uses sesterce, plural sesterces, terce being the English equivalent of tertius. A modern shorthand for values in sestertii is ~~IIS~~ (Unicode êÜò), in which the Roman numeral II is followed by S for semis, and the whole struck through; but because this symbol and striking through letters are not always convenient, HS may be used instead, with the horizontal bar of the 'H' representing the strike through the numeral II, rather than the letter H. Example of a detailed portrait of Hadrian 117 to 138 History The sestertius was introduced c. 211 BC as a small silver coin valued at one-quarter of a denarius (and thus one hundredth of an aureus). A silver denarius was supposed to weigh about 4.5 grams, valued at ten grams, with the silver sestertius valued at two and one- half grams. In practice, the coins were usually underweight. When the denarius was retariffed to sixteen asses (due to the gradual reduction in the size of bronze denominations), the sestertius was accordingly revalued to four asses, still equal to one quarter of a denarius. It was produced sporadically, far less often than the denarius, through 44 BC. Hostilian under Trajan Decius AD 250 In or about 23 BC, with the coinage reform of Augustus, the sestertius was reintroduced as a large brass denomination. While the as, now made of copper, was worth one quarter of a sestertius. Augustus tariffed the value of the sestertius as one hundredth of the gold aureus. The sestertius was produced as the largest brass denomination until the late 3rd century AD. Most were struck in the mint of Rome but from AD 64 during the reign of Nero (AD 54‚Äì68) and Vespasian (AD 69‚Äì79), the mint of Lyon (Lugdunum), supplemented production. Lyon sestertii can be recognised by a small globe, or legend stop, beneath the bust. The brass sestertius typically weighs in the region of 25 to 28 grams, is around 32‚Äì34 mm in diameter and about 4 mm thick. The distinction between bronze and brass was important to the Romans. Their name for brass was orichalcum, also spelled aurichalcum (echoing the word for a gold coin, aureus), meaning 'gold-copper', because of its shiny, gold-like appearance when the coins were newly struck (see, for example Pliny the Elder in his Natural History Book 34.4). Orichalcum was considered, by weight, to be about double the value of copper. This is why the half-sestertius, the dupondius, was around the same size and weight as the bronze was, but was worth two asses. Sestertii continued to be struck until the late 3rd century, although there was a marked deterioration in the quality of the metal used and the striking even though portraiture remained strong. Later emperors increasingly relied on melting down older sestertii, a process which led to the zinc component being gradually lost as it burned off in the high temperatures needed to melt copper (zinc melts at 419 ¬∞C but boils at 907 ¬∞C, copper melts at 1085 ¬∞C). The shortfall was made up with bronze and even lead. Later sestertii tend to be darker in appearance as a result and are made from more crudely prepared blanks (see the Hostilian coin on this page). The gradual impact of inflation caused by debasement of the silver currency meant that the purchasing power of the sestertius and smaller denominations like the dupondius and as was steadily reduced. In the 1st century AD, everyday small change was dominated by the dupondius and as, but in the 2nd century, as inflation hit, the sestertius became the dominant small change. In the 3rd century silver coinage contained less and less silver, and more and more copper or bronze. By the 260s and 270s the main unit was the double-denarius, the Antoninianus, but by then these small coins were almost all bronze. Although these coins were theoretically worth eight sestertii, the average sestertius was worth far more in plain terms of the metal it contained. Some of the last sestertii were struck by Aurelian (270‚Äì275 AD). During the end of its issue, when sestertii were reduced in size and quality, the double sestertius was issued first by Trajan Decius (249‚Äì251 AD) and later in large quantity by the ruler of a breakaway regime in the West, named Postumus (259‚Äì268 AD), who often used worn old sestertii to overstrike his image and legends on. The double sestertius was distinguished from the sestertius by the radiate crown worn by the emperor, a device used to distinguish the dupondius from the as and the Antoninianus from the denarius. Eventually, many sestertii were withdrawn by the state and by forgers, to melt down to make the debased Antoninianus, which made inflation worse. In the coinage reforms of the 4th century, the sestertius played no part and passed into history. Sestertius of Hadrian, dupondius of Antoninus Pius, and as of Marcus Aurelius Unit of account The sestertius was also used as a standard unit of account and was represented on inscriptions with the monogram HS. Large values were recorded in terms of sestertium milia, thousands of sestertii, with the milia often omitted and implied. The wealthy general and politician of the late Roman Republic, Crassus, who fought in the war to defeat Spartacus, was said by Pliny the Elder to have had \\"estates worth 200 million sesterces\\". A loaf of bread cost roughly half a sestertius, and a sextarius (c. 0.5 L) of wine anywhere from less than half to more than one sestertius. One modius (6.67 kg) of wheat in 79 AD Pompeii cost seven sestertii, of rye three sestertii, a bucket two sestertii, a tunic fifteen sestertii, a donkey five hundred sestertii. According to Tacitus' Annals, book I, chapter 17.4 and 17.5, soldiers of the Rhine army who rose against Tiberius were paid ten asses a day, out of which they had to pay, among other things, for their own uniforms. They demanded to be paid a denarius a day, and they got it.Tacitus, Annales 1.17.4 and 1.17.5: Enimvero militiam ipsam gravem, infructuosam: denis in diem assibus animam et corpus aestimari: hinc vestem arma tentoria, hinc saevitiam centurionum et vacationes munerum redimi. At hercule verbera et vulnera, duram hiemem, exercitas aestates, bellum atrox: aut sterilem pacem sempiterna) Nec aliud levamentum quam si certis sub legibus militia iniretur, ut singulos denarios mererent, sextus decumus stipendii annus finem adferret, ne ultra sub vexillis tenerentur, sed isdem in castris praemium pecunia solveretur. Records from Pompeii show a slave being sold at auction for 6,252 sestertii. A writing tablet from Londinium (Roman London), dated to c. 75‚Äì125 AD, records the sale of a Gallic slave girl called Fortunata for 600 denarii, equal to 2,400 sestertii, to a man called Vegetus. It is difficult to make any comparisons with modern coinage or prices, but for most of the 1st century AD, the ordinary legionary was paid nine hundred sestertii per annum, rising to twelve hundred under Domitian (81‚Äì96 AD), the equivalent of 3.3 sestertii per day. Half of it was deducted for living costs, leaving the soldier, if he was lucky enough to get paid, with about 1.65 sestertii per day. Numismatic value A sestertius of Nero, struck at Rome in 64 AD. The reverse depicts the emperor on horseback with a companion. The legend reads DECVRSIO, meaning \\"a military exercise\\". Diameter 35 mm Sestertii are highly valued by numismatists, since their large size gave caelatores (engravers) a large area in which to produce detailed portraits and reverse types. The most celebrated are those produced for Nero (54‚Äì68 AD) between the years 64 and 68 AD, created by some of the most accomplished coin engravers in history. The brutally realistic portraits of this emperor, and the elegant reverse designs, greatly impressed and influenced the artists of the Renaissance. The series issued by Hadrian (117‚Äì138 AD), recording his travels around the Roman Empire, depicts the Empire at its height, and included the first representation on a coin of the figure of Britannia; centuries later it was revived by English king Charles II, and continues to feature on the United Kingdom coinage. As a result of ceasing production and withdrawals from circulation in the 4th century, sestertii are less common as a whole compared to other Roman bronze coins. Fully struck examples with sharp detail often command high premiums at auction.

Shane O'Neill's career was marked by his ambition to be The O'Neill ‚Äì sovereign of the dominant O'Neill family of T√≠r Eoghain‚Äîand thus overlord of the entire province. This brought him into conflict with competing branches of the O'Neill family and with the English government in Ireland, who recognised a rival claim. Shanes's support was considered worth gaining by the English even during the lifetime of his father Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone (died 1559). But rejecting overtures from Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, the lord deputy from 1556, Shane refused to help the English against the Scottish settlers on the coast of Antrim, allying himself instead with the MacDonnells, the most powerful of these immigrants. Name The name \\"Shane\\" is an anglicisation of the Gaelic name \\"Se√°n\\" (John). Shane's name is given in the Annals of the Four Masters (at M1567.2) as \\"Sean mac Cuinn, mic Cuinn mic Enri, mic Eocchain\\" (\\"John son of Conn, son of Conn, son of Henry, son of Eoin\\") Elsewhere in the Annals (e.g. at M1552.7) he is referred to as \\"Sean Donngaileach √ì Neill\\".O'Donovan (1851), p. 1525 This refers to the fact that as a youth he was fostered by his cousins, the O'Donnelly Clan, of which the Chief was Marshal of the O'Neill forces. This was rendered as anglicisations such as \\"Donnolloh\\" in contemporary manuscripts,For example, and as \\"John, or Shane Doulenagh O'Neil\\" in Abb√© MacGeoghegan's 1758 History of Ireland. After he assumed the leadership of the O'Neills, he was referred to simply as \\"√ì N√©ill\\" (\\"The O'Neill\\"). The nickname \\"Shane the Proud\\" (), which appears in nineteenth and early twentieth century popular histories, was coined some time after his death by English writers, and originally had the pejorative meaning of \\"arrogant\\", because they wished to portray him as vain, self-indulgent and ruthless, and thus undermine the legitimacy of his claim to the earldom of Tyrone. Holinshed's Chronicles of 1587, for instance, had a side-note, \\"The proud taunts of Shane O'neile\\", the text remarking that \\"when the commissioners were sent to intreat with him vpon sundrie points, they found him most arrogant & out of all good order, braieng out sp√©eches not m√©et nor s√©emelie.\\" Later Irish writers, such as John Mitchel and P. J. O‚ÄôShea (Con√°n Maol) used the nickname with more positive connotations. Early life Shane was born in or just before 1530, to Conn Bacach O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of Tyrone, and Sorcha O'Neill, daughter of Hugh Oge O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of Clandeboye. Shane's mother died while he was very young and Shane, following Gaelic custom, was fostered by the O'Donnelly family, who raised him until adulthood. As the youngest of Conn's six sons, the fact that he was not sent to one of the great families for fostering suggests that he was not expected to achieve much status. He was briefly abducted in 1531 by a rival O'Neill family, but otherwise nothing is known about his youth. Feuding within the O'Neill lordship The English, since the late 1530s, had been expanding their control over Ireland, this century-long effort is known as the Tudor conquest of Ireland. To incorporate the native Irish lordships, they granted English titles to Irish lords ‚Äì thus making Conn Bacach O'Neill, Shane's father, the first Earl of Tyrone. However, whereas in Gaelic custom the successor to a lordship was elected from his kinsmen in the system of Tanistry, the English insisted on succession by the first-born son or primogeniture. This created a conflict between Shane, who considered it his natural right to be head of his clan, and an \\"affiliated son\\" or adopteeMorgan, Hiram Tyrone's Rebellion (1993) pp. 86‚Äì7. The genealogy of the O'Neills that Hiram Morgan has prepared notes Matthew as \\"affiliated\\". of his father Conn Bacach, Matthew O'Neill or Fear Dorcha who was 'conveniently mistaken' as the offspring of Conn when he travelled to London in 1542 to be invested with the Earldom of Tyrone. Feardorcha had accompanied Conn's entourage as the Earl's eldest son Phelim Caoch O'Neill had been killed by his enemy Gillespic MacDonnellDonald M. Schlegel, \\"The MacDonnells of Tyrone and Armagh: A Genealogical Study\\", Seanchas Ardmhacha, vol. 10, no. 1 (1980/1981), p. 205 during a raid in Ulster shortly before Conn's inauguration visit. Gillespic MacDonnell's family were noted as committed adherents of Feardorcha and his descendants. During his trip to the English court to receive the title of earl of Tyrone, Shane's father Conn Bacach, who had just lost his eldest son and was in open conflict with his surviving sons, was accompanied by the fosterling Mathew (known as Feardorcha in Irish), a youth who, until he was sixteen had been acknowledged as the son of a Dundalk blacksmith.Richard Bagwell, Ireland Under the Tudors, (3 Vols) London, vol ii, pp. 2‚Äì4. Feardorcha's mother Alison Kelly was Conn Bacach's lover. When Conn was created earl of Tyrone, Mathew was declared to be Conn's heir in English law, disinheriting all of Conn's surviving sons, including Shane. Under English law, Mathew, titled Baron of Dungannon from Conn's principal house in Tyrone, was intended to succeed him as 2nd Earl of Tyrone. However, Mathew was ambushed and killed by Shane's foster brothers, the O'Donnelly, in 1558, some months before the death of Conn Bacach, and the claim to the earldom passed to Brian, Mathew's eldest son, who was later killed in 1562 in a skirmish with Turlough Luineach. The claim to the earldom now passed to Mathew's next son Hugh O'Neill who had been removed to England by Sir Henry Sidney in 1559 and was brought up there while Shane established his supremacy in Ulster; some sources say it was to the Pale that he was removed. Becoming the O'Neill Shane was inaugurated as the O'Neill. In English law this was an illegal usurpation of the rulership of Ulster. But according to Gaelic Irish law (derbfine), Shane had every claim to be chief of the name. The case for Mathew's disqualifying status under both English and Irish law, as an affiliated member of the family rather than as an actual son of Conn Bacach,Sean Ghall, \\"An Historical Note on Shane O'Neill\\", The Catholic Bulletin, vol XIII, April‚ÄìMay 1923, pp. 311‚Äì314. was carefully stated by Shane when he made his own claim to the title of Earl of Tyrone both before and during his visit to Queen Elizabeth in 1562,JS Brewer and W Bullen, (eds), Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts Preserved in the Archepiscopal Library at Lambeth, 1515‚Äì1624, (6 vols), London, vol. i, pp. 304‚Äì8; Ciar√°n Brady \\"The Government of Ireland, circa 1540‚Äì1583' PhD Trinity college, Dublin, 1981, pp. 153‚Äì4, 180‚Äì5. and restated in some detail by the English authorities when Hugh O'Neill was outlawed during the Nine Years War. Relationship with the English Although the O'Neill had allied himself against the English with the Scottish MacDonnell clan, who had settled in Antrim, Queen Elizabeth I, on succeeding to the English throne in 1558, was inclined to come to terms with the O'Neill, who after his father's death functioned as de facto head of the dynasty. She accordingly agreed to recognise his claims to the lordship, throwing over Brian O'Neill, son of the assassinated Feardorcha, Baron of Dungannon, if the O'Neill would submit to her authority and that of her deputy. O'Neill refused to put himself in the power of the Earl of Sussex, Thomas Radclyffe, without a guarantee for his safety; and so Elizabeth decided to establish Brian in his place. An attempt by Sussex to increase the enmity of the O'Donnells against the O'Neill was frustrated by his seizure of Calvagh O'Donnell in a monastery. Elizabeth, whose prudence and parsimony were averse to so formidable an undertaking as the complete subjugation of the powerful O'Neill, desired peace with him at almost any price. Elizabeth's faith in Sussex's aggressive strategy diminished when the repeated annual devastations of O'Neill's territory by the Lord Deputy with sizeable and expensive armies failed to bring him to submission. The O'Neill destroyed the greater part of Sussex's invasion army at the Battle of the Red Sagums, 18 July 1561, while Sussex was deep in O'Neill-controlled territory garrisoning Armagh with a small body of men. Afterwards Elizabeth sent the Earl of Kildare to arrange terms with the O'Neill, who was demanding a complete withdrawal of the English from his territory. Unable to succeed against O'Neill in battle, Sussex tried in 1561 to assassinate him using poisoned wine. The O'Neill now called the lord deputy to account for his unnatural enmity, as displayed in this most recent of many attempts on his life. Elizabeth consented to treat, and hostilities ceased on terms that gave the O'Neill practically all his demands. The O'Neill offered some concessions, most significantly consenting to present himself before Elizabeth in London to argue his case against Sussex and the Baron of Dungannon in person. The O'Neill requested the hand of Sussex's half- sister Lady Frances Radclyffe in marriage as an earnest of future friendship. Accompanied by the Earls of Ormonde and Kildare as surety for his safety, the O'Neill reached London on 4 January 1562. William Camden describes the wonder which his gallowglasses occasioned in the English capital, with their heads bare, their long hair falling over their shoulders and clipped short in front above the eyes, and clothed in saffron-dyed shirts of fine linen. Elizabeth was less concerned with the respective claims of Shane O'Neill and the Baron of Dungannon, the former resting on Gaelic law, the latter on an English patent, than with the question of policy involved. Characteristically, she temporised; but fearing that Shane could become a tool of Spanish intriguers, she permitted him to return to Ireland, recognising him as The O'Neill. (Elizabeth's recognition of his claim to the title The O'Neill was meaningless, except symbolically, as she had no authority to confirm a title conferred under Brehon law.) During this visit Shane's legal claim to his father Conn Bacach's earldom was verbally confirmed and Shane was led to believe that he would be recognised as the 2nd Earl of Tyrone, though some reservation was made of the possible future rights of Hugh O'Neill, who had succeeded his brother Brian as Baron of Dungannon. Brian had been killed in a skirmish in April 1562 by Shane's Tanaiste, Turlough Luineach O'Neill. However, confirmation of the grant of the earldom was never delivered, and the O'Neill was compelled to defend his hegemony in Ulster when his onetime supporter Sir Henry Sidney was appointed Lord Deputy and resurrected Sussex's policy of undermining the O'Neill's authority. War in Ulster There were at this time three powerful contemporary members of the O'Neill dynasty in Ireland ‚Äì Shane O'Neill himself, Sir Turlough and Brian, 1st Baron of Dungannon. Turlough had been elected t√°naiste or Tanist (second-in-command and successor) when Shane was inaugurated as the O'Neill, and hoping to supplant him. During Shane's absence in London, Turlough assassinated his principal rival, Mathew's eldest son Brian, during the O'Neill's absence when rumours of his imprisonment began to circulate. On return to Ireland, the O'Neill quickly re-established his authority, and, in spite of Sussex's protestations, renewed his battle with the O'Donnells and the MacDonnells to force them to recognise O'Neill hegemony in Ulster. In turning his hand against the MacDonnells, Shane O'Neill claimed that he was serving the Queen of England in harrying the Scots. He fought an indecisive battle with Sorley Boy MacDonnell near Coleraine in 1564, and the following Easter hosted his entire army at Feadan above Newry. Marching north at unprecedented speed, the O'Neill surprised the MacDonnells, who had expected him to intervene against an incursion by James MacDonnell of Dunnyveg's own household troops who had landed in Lecale. While James MacDonnell of Dunnyveg and his brothers rapidly assembled an army in Scotland, the O'Neill defeated Sorley Boy MacDonnell's local levies at Knockboy above Broughshane, crossed the Antrim mountains by way of Clogh and after burning James's new castle at Redbay, pursued the remains of Sorley's army and the recently landed army under James to the neighbourhood of Ballycastle, where he routed the MacDonnells at the Battle of Glentasie and took Sorley's and his badly wounded brother James prisoner. This victory greatly strengthened Shane O'Neill's position, and Sir Henry Sidney, who became lord deputy in 1565, declared to the earl of Leicester that \\"Lucifer himself was not more puffed up with pride and ambition than O'Neill\\". The O'Neill ravaged the Pale, failed in an attempt on Dundalk, made a truce with the MacDonnells, and sought help from the Earl of Desmond. The English invaded Donegal and restored O'Donnell. Wives The custom among the nobility of sixteenth-century Ireland was for marriage to be undertaken to cement political alliances between powerful or enemy families. If the alliance fell apart, the wife could return to her father in a form of political divorce. All Shane's marriages were of this type. His first wife was Catherine, the daughter of James MacDonald of Dunnyveg, Lord of the Isles. The O'Neill married Catherine while the MacDonnells were providing him with military support during the 1550s to contest the Lordship of Tyrone with his father Conn Bacach, at the time The O'Neill. The O'Neill divorced Catherine to forge an alliance with the O'Donnells of Tyrconnell. He married Mary, a daughter of the Lord of Tyrconnell, Calvagh O'Donnell. Mary's brother's open hostility to the alliance led to the O'Neill rejecting Mary. In the ensuing conflict, the O'Neill captured and imprisoned her father Calvagh O'Donnell. Calvagh was married to Catherine, the Dowager Countess of Argyll and daughter of Hector Mor MacLean of Clan MacLean of Duart on the Scottish island of Mull. Catherine was also the former wife of Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll, whose favour could ensure Shane a ready supply of Highland \\"redshank\\" mercenaries. Shane kept Calvagh imprisoned at Benburb and his island stronghold of Fuath na nGall (translation: \\"Hatred of Foreigners\\") on the shore of Lough Neagh for many years. During Calvagh O'Donnell's imprisonment, this Catherine willingly became the O'Neill's lover. Upon Calvagh's eventual negotiated release, Catherine refused to accompany him, electing to stay with Shane. Her father, Hector Mor MacLean, came to Ireland and blessed her marriage with the O'Neill in 1563. During the O'Neill's visit to London in 1563, he requested that Queen Elizabeth should find him a \\"a well-born Englishwoman\\" for a wife. Between May and June 1567, while the O'Neill was attempting to negotiate a military alliance with the MacDonnells in the wake of his catastrophic defeat at battle of Farsetmore, he discussed the possibility of divorcing Catherine MacLean to marry his current lover, Agnes Campbell, widow of James MacDonald; the O'Neill had captured her with her husband at the Battle of Glentasie in 1565. Agnes was the illegitimate sister of Catherine's earlier husband, the Earl of Argyll. The O'Neill was, however, still married to Catherine on 2 June 1567, the day of his assassination at Castle Cara, Cushendun, at the hands of a MacDonnell group with whom he was negotiating possible military aid. Catherine and her children had accompanied the O'Neill and his entourage to the MacDonnell camp at Castle Cara below Ballyterrim, and after his assassination they fled across the river Bann to the forest of Glenconkeyne, where they were protected by a lord of the Clandeboye O'Neills. Catherine made her way to safety at Duart Castle, where her brother fostered the youngest of Shane's children, those who had been born to his sister, while offering protection to the other MacShanes. Descendants: the Mac Shanes Shane had at least ten sons by his wives, as well as possible other offshoots. Many of them were fostered in O'Neill relations and vassals after their father's death, and they became the rival force to Hugh O'Neill in his climb to power in the 1580‚Äì1600 time frame. His known children were: *Shane Og, whose mother was Catherine MacDonnell. He was tanist to Turlough Luineach, in 1579, and died in 1581 on a raid. *Henry MacShane O'Neill, whose mother was Catherine MacDonnell. Father of Sir Henry √ì N√©ill and Con Boy McHenry. Perhaps the most famous of Shane's sons, he was given a large Estate in Orior County, Armagh. He died in 1622. *Con MacShane O'Neill, whose mother was either Catherine MacLean or the daughter of Shane √ìg Maguire. He invaded Ulster in 1583 with 3,000 Scottish soldiers and was named Tanist of The O'Neill, Turlough Luineach, in the 1580s. During the Nine Years' War he fought against his cousin the earl and was given a large estate M() and the Manor lordship of Clabbye in Fermanagh. He played a part in Ulster politics until his death in 1630/1. Two of his grandsons were made Spanish counts. *Turlough, whose mother was Catherine MacDonnell of the Route. He died 1598. *Hugh Gaveloch, the most popular of the Mac Shanes, led an army of his McLean kinsmen into Ulster to support his claim to The O'Neill M√≥r title, but was captured and hanged by his first cousin, Hugh, Earl of Tyrone. He died in 1590. *Niall, whose mother is thought to have been Catherine O'Donnell. *Art, whose mother was Catherine MacLean; he died of exposure after escaping from English captivity in a heroic trek from Dublin Castle through snow-covered Dublin and Wicklow with Red Hugh O'Donnell at Christmas 1592. *Brian Laighneach, whose mother was Catherine MacLean. He died after 1598. *Edmond, died fighting against Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. *Cormac, whose mother was Catherine MacLean, stayed with his brother Hugh MacShane, as did his son Cormac Boy (Buidhe). He died after 1603. *Rose, who married Conn O'Donnell of Lifford. Possible: *Hugh McShane O'Neill, whose mother was Catherine MacLean, became chief of the O'Neill sept inside Glenconkeyne forest and was known from that point on as the \\"MacShanes\\". Hugh may have been the son of Shane's son Conn Mac Shane. He died in 1621. Several of Hugh's brothers are listed in pardons issued by letters patent on 20 October 1609, which included Ever McShane, Neale McShane, Gilegroome McShane and Brian McShane. Another brother appears to have been a Tirlogh, who had several sons pardoned in the same patent.Calender Patent Rolls, James I, Patent 6, XXV. Pg. 132 Defeat and death Failing in an attempt to arrange terms, and also in obtaining the help which he solicited from France, the O'Neill was utterly routed by the O'Donnells again at the battle of Farsetmore near Letterkenny; and seeking safety in flight, he threw himself on the mercy of his enemies, the MacDonnells. Attended by a small body of gallowglass, and taking his prisoner Sorley Boy with him, he presented himself among the MacDonnells near Cushendun, on the Antrim coast, hoping to propose an alliance. Here, on 2 June 1567, he was killed by the MacDonnells, and his headless body was buried at Crosskern Church at Ballyterrim above Cushendun. His body was possibly later moved to Glenarm Abbey. Unbeknownst to Shane, The Scots had already come to an agreement with Henry Sidney and William Piers, Seneschal of Clandeboye, commander of the English garrison at Carrickfergus. The English Government tried to pass this off as a \\"drunken brawl\\" turned savage. Piers travelled to Cushendun to take Shane's head and send it to Dublin Castle. In his private character Shane O'Neill was presented by the English as a brutal, uneducated savage. However, Irish history is often written by English historians. The O'Neill had talent as a politician and tactician. Calvagh O'Donnell, when Shane's prisoner, claimed he was subjected to continual torture. However, Calvagh's wife, Catherine, the dowager Countess of Argyle, became his lover; Shane married her in 1563 and had several children by her. He frustrated his English opponents with his ability to defeat them in the field and then again at court. His death was greeted with delight by his enemies in London. Shane was succeeded as the O'Neill by his tainiste, Turlough Luineach O'Neill who married Shane's lover, Agnes Campbell, a natural daughter of Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll some months after the assassination. Two of his sons became tanists to Turlough Luineach in his attempts to neutralise Hugh, Earl of Tyrone. The Bishop of Clogher, Miler Magrath, said \\"the people[ of Ulster] adhere to the MacShanes, whom they consider the true branch of Conn Bacach's line\\", but with their arch-enemy Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, entering into warfare with the outbreak of the Nine Years' War the MacShanes were compelled to support Hugh's enemy, the Dublin administration, and their support in Tyrone withered. Cultural recognition Antrim GAA has a Gaelic Athletic Club club named in his honour, Shane O'Neill's GAC, founded by the solicitor and antiquarian Francis Joseph Bigger. It is situated in the outskirts of Glenarm village in Feystown and has over 100 members. Shane O'Neill's hurling club was the first official GAA club in Glenarm, founded in 1903 using land donated by the Gibson family of the Libbert, Glenarm. Arthur and Dan Gibson went on to represent County Antrim. There is also a Shane O'Neill's GAC in Camloch, County Armagh. A cairn was raised at his reputed burial place above Cushendun by the antiquarian Francis Joseph Bigger in 1908 and yearly commemorations held in Shane's honour between that date and 1914. The poet Robinson Jeffers visited the site in 1929 and refers to Shane's Cairn in several poems in the sequence Descent to the Dead, inspired by his pilgrimage to Ireland.Spottiswoode, Roland At the Grave of Shane O'Neill, Commemorations at Shane's Cairn Cushendun, 1908‚Äì1914\\" in D√∫iche N√©ill no 18 2010, pp. 9‚Äì28.

In 1541 O'Neill travelled to England to submit to Henry VIII as part of the surrender and regrant policy that coincided with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland. He was made Earl of Tyrone, but his plans to pass the title and lands on to a chosen successor Matthew were thwarted by a violent succession dispute that led to another son, Shane O'Neill, emerging triumphant. His grandson Hugh O'Neill eventually succeeded him as Earl and became head of the O'Neill dynasty. Hugh continued his grandfather's alliance with the Crown until his eventual leadership of Tyrone's Rebellion and later Flight of the Earls led to the collapse of the power of the traditional Irish lords in Ulster. Biography Conn Bacach O'Neill was the son of Conn M√≥r O'Neill, King of T√≠r E√≥gain (Tyrone), and Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald. Con Mor O'Neill was the son of Henry √ì N√©ill, King of T√≠r E√≥gain. Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald was the daughter of Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare. Con Bacach O'Neill was the first of the √ì N√©ills whom the English, in their attempts to subjugate Ireland in the 16th century, brought to the front as leaders of the native Irish. His father, the King of T√≠r E√≥gan, was murdered in 1493 by his brother. Becoming The O'Neill Conn, became chief of the T√≠r Eoghain branch of the √ì N√©ills (Cen√©l nE√≥gain) c. 1519 after the death of his uncle. At that time, to assume the title The O'Neill M√≥r, meant one assumed control over the entire √ì N√©ill nation. When his kinsman Kildare became viceroy in 1524, √ì N√©ill consented to act as his swordbearer in ceremonies of state; but his allegiance was a personal matter, and while ready enough to give verbal assurances of loyalty, he could not be persuaded to readily give hostages to later lord Deputies as security for his conduct. Threat of excommunication By 1534, several excommunications had been pronounced against Conn by the archbishop of Armagh. That year diverse followers of Conn raided the archiepiscopal manor in Armagh, inflicting harm on its custodian, Senekin McDugan, with Conn ordering the revenues to be paid to the excommunicated clergyman John O'Corr and his brethren. Conn had previously been invoked by the primate as the secular arm in ensuring that no harm came to Senekin McDugan amongst other items, with excommunication and interdict amongst the results of failing to.Archbishop Cromer's Register.

A. Gwynn. Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society. Vol. 10, No. 3 (1943), pp. 165-179 (15 pages). Pg. 173-4 Invasion and submission With the attainder of the Earl of Kildare and following rebellion, Conn sided with his in-laws the FitzGeralds. An alliance referred to as the Geraldine League sought the restoration of the heir of the FitzGerald lordship without interference from King Henry VIII of England. That rebellion was stoked with the idea of casting off England's Protestant church in Ireland, to the point that Pope Paul III wrote to Conn personally, calling him \\"King of our Realm in Ireland\\", encouraging him to fight King Henry in 1538.O'Neill travelled to London to submit to Henry VIII the newly established King of Ireland. This was part of a major policy of surrender and regrant in which Gaelic lords formally acknowledged the Crown's authority. After T√≠r E√≥gain was invaded in 1541 by Sir Anthony St Leger, the lord deputy, Conn and the Geraldine League were defeated and he made his submission. Conn delivered up his son Phelim Caoch as a hostage. He attended a parliament held at Trim, and, crossing to England, became a Protestant, and made his submission at Greenwich to Henry VIII. Henry created him earl of Tyrone for life, and presented him with money and a valuable gold chain. He was also made a privy councillor in Ireland, and received a grant of lands within the Pale called Balgriffin. Civil war This event created a deep impression in Ireland, where √ì N√©ill's submission to the English king, and his acceptance of an English title, were resented by his clansmen and dependents. The rest of the earl's life was mainly occupied by endeavours to maintain his influence, and by an undying feud with his younger son Shane, arising out of his transaction with Henry VIII. For not only did the nomination of √ì N√©ill's reputed son Matthew (Ir. Feardorcha) as his heir with the title of baron of Dungannon by the English king conflict with the Irish custom of tanistry, which employed derbfine to define strict rules of direct relationship within male blood lines to regulate qualification for the chieftainship of the Irish clans, but Matthew, whose claim to being an actual son of Conn √ì N√©ill was in considerable doubt, was at best illegitimate and at worst simply an adopteeMorgan, Hiram Tyrone's Rebellion, RHS & Boydell, (1993) pp. 86‚Äì7 the genealogy Hiram Morgan has prepared notes Matthew as \\"affiliated\\".See: Fiona FitzSimons, ‚ÄòFosterage and Gossipred in Late Medieval Ireland: Some new evidence‚Äô in Patrick J.

Shane O' Neill, HAI, 1996, p 22 Shane, Conn's eldest living legitimate son after the assassination of Phelim Caoch by an adherent of Feardorcha, was not the man to submit tamely to any invasion of his right of succession. The fierce family feud in which Feardorcha was strongly supported by the Dublin Castle administration was only terminated when Feardorcha was murdered by agents of Shane in 1558; Conn dying about a year later. Marriage and children Conn's grandson Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. Conn was twice married and had numerous sons. His first wife was Lady Alice Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and Conn's first cousin. His known sons were Phelim Caoch O'Neill. \\"Caoch\\" was the nickname for someone with poor eyesight or \\"the blind\\". In early 1542 'The son of O'Neill (Felim Caech, son of Con, son of Con) was killed with one cast of a javelin by MacDonnell Gallowglagh\\" according to the entry recording his death in the Annals of the Four Masters of Ireland.,The Four Masters, [ed. John O'Donovan] Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland from the Earliest Times to the Year 1616, Third edition, De B√∫rca Rare Books (Dublin, 1990). p. 1467. just prior to his father's submission to Henry VIII. His second wife was Sorcha O'Neill, daughter of Hugh Oge O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of Clandeboye. Sources differ in regards to the mother of Shane. Some stating he was the son of Conn and Sorcha and some stating he was from Conn and Lady Alice Fitzgerald.Acts of the Privy Council in Ireland 1556-1571, pg. 107,298 Conn claimed an illegitimate son named Matthew or Ferdocha \\"the dark one\\" with Allison Kelly, the widowed wife of a blacksmith in Dundalk. Parenting aside, it was this Matthew that Conn designated as his heir to the English titles. He became the Baron of Dungannon when Conn became the Earl of Tyrone. This act caused great angst within the O'Neill clan and eventually leading to civil war and the death of Matthew at the instigation of his half brother Shane. As well an illegitimate daughter of Conn married the celebrated Sorley Boy MacDonnell, the man who eventually took part in the death of Shane O'Neill himself. His family spread throughout Ireland, Scotland, Europe and the New World during the downfall of the Gaelic Order, and today there are numerous families with a direct descent from Conn. At his death, Conn's lands and family were in turmoil; however, at the peak of his lengthy reign, he was the most powerful Irish king. He was known throughout Europe as a strong and able leader, a hearty warrior, and looked to by the Catholic world as a bastion of strength against the English crown, despite his conversion to the Protestant faith.

The Dupondius was introduced during the Roman Republic as a large bronze cast coin, although even at introduction it weighed less than 2 pounds. The initial coins featured the bust of Roma on the obverse and a six-spoked wheel on the reverse. A loaf of bread or a sextarius (c. 0.5 L) of wine cost roughly one Dupondius at the height of the Roman Empire, though due to the debasement of the Denarius over the following century, the Dupondius was discarded. With the coinage reform of Augustus in about 23 BC, the sestertius and dupondius were produced in a golden colored copper-alloy called orichalcum by the Romans and numismatists, and Latin brass by us, while lower denominations were produced out of reddish copper. However, some dupondii were made entirely from copper under Augustus, while under Nero some aes were made from both orichalcum and copper, instead of only copper for aes coined until then. Therefore, the latter can only be distinguished from dupondii by their smaller size instead of by also the appearance of the metal. The dupondius was normally further distinguished from the similarly sized as with the addition of a radiate crown to the bust of the emperor in 66 AD during the reign of Nero. Using a radiate crown to indicate double value was also markedly used on the antoninianus (double denarius) introduced by Caracalla and the double sestertius. Since dupondii minted prior to and during the reign of Nero, and occasionally under later rulers, lack the radiate crown, it is often hard to distinguish between the as and the dupondius due to heavy patina which often obscures the coin's original color. An extremely rare dupondius from the reign of Marcus Aurelius, dated to 154 or 155 and in excellent condition, was discovered in 2007 at the archeological site in Draper's Gardens, London.

This model can be found inside the tower. A scale model of hydropower turbine A scale model is most generally a physical representation of an object that maintains accurate relationships between all important aspects of the model, although absolute values of the original properties need not be preserved. This enables it to demonstrate some behavior or property of the original object without examining the original object itself. The most familiar scale models represent the physical appearance of an object in miniature, but there are many other kinds. Scale models are used in many fields including engineering, architecture, filmmaking, military command, salesmanship, and hobby model building. While each field may use a scale model for a different purpose, all scale models are based on the same principles and must meet the same general requirements to be functional. The detail requirements vary depending on the needs of the modeler. To be a true scale model, all relevant aspects must be accurately modeled, such as material properties, so the model's interaction with the outside world is reliably related to the original object's interaction with the real world.  Requirements  In general a scale model must be designed and built primarily considering similitude theory. However, other requirements concerning practical issues must also be considered. = Similitude requirements = Similitude is the theory and art of predicting prototype (original object) performance from scale model observations.Crowe, C., et al. 2010, p. 259 The main requirement of similitude is all dimensionless quantities must be equal for both the scaled model and the prototype under the conditions the modeler desires to make observations. Dimensionless quantities are generally referred to as Pi terms, or œÄ terms. In many fields the œÄ terms are well established. For example, in fluid dynamics, a well known dimensionless number called the Reynolds number comes up frequently in scale model tests with fluid in motion relative to a stationary surface.Crowe, C., et al. 2010, p. 262 Thus, for a scale model test to be reliable, the Reynolds number, as well as all other important dimensionless quantities, must be equal for both scale model and prototype under the conditions that the modeler wants to observe. An example of the Reynolds number and its use in similitude theory satisfaction can be observed in the scale model testing of fluid flow in a horizontal pipe. The Reynolds number for the scale model pipe must be equal to the Reynolds number of the prototype pipe for the flow measurements of the scale model to correspond to the prototype in a meaningful way. This can be written mathematically, with the subscript m referring to the scale model and subscript p referring to the prototype, as follows: \\\\mathrm{Re}_m = {{\\\\rho_m {\\\\mathbf v_m} L_m} \\\\over {\\\\mu_m}} = {{\\\\rho_p {\\\\mathbf v_p} L_p} \\\\over {\\\\mu_p}} = \\\\mathrm{Re}_p where * {\\\\mathbf v} is the mean velocity of the object relative to the fluid (SI units: m/s) * {L} is a characteristic linear dimension, (travelled length of the fluid; hydraulic diameter when dealing with river systems) (m) * {\\\\mu} is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa¬∑s or N¬∑s/m¬≤ or kg/(m¬∑s)) * {\\\\rho}\\\\, is the density of the fluid (kg/m¬≥). Observing the equation above it is clear to see that while the Reynolds numbers must be equal for the scale model and the prototype, this can be accomplished in many different ways, for example, in this problem by altering the scale of the dynamic viscosity of the model to work with the scale of the length. This means, the scales of different quantities, for example a material's elasticity in the scale model versus the prototype, are governed by equating the dimensionless quantities and the other quantity's scaling within the dimensionless quantity to ensure the dimensionless quantity of interest is of equal magnitude for the scale model and prototype.  Scaling  With the above understanding of similitude requirements, it becomes clear the scale often reported in scale models refers only to the geometric scale, \\\\mathrm{S}_L (L referring to length), and not the scale of the parameters potentially important to consider in the scale model design and fabrication. In general the scale of any quantity i, perhaps material density or viscosity, is defined as: \\\\mathrm{S}_i = {{i_p} \\\\over{i_m}} where * i_p is the quantity value of the prototype * i_m is the quantity value of the scale model This relationship must be applied to all quantities of interest in the prototype, observing similitude requirements‚Äîso the scale model can be built using dimensions and materials that make scale model testing results meaningful with respect to the prototype.Harris, H., et al. 1999, p. 57 One method to determine the dimensionless quantities of concern for a given problem is to use dimensional analysis. = Practical requirements = Practical concerns include the cost to construct the model, available test facilities to condition and observe the model, the availability of certain materials, and even who will build it. Practical requirements are often very diverse depending on the purpose of the scale model and they all must be considered to have a successful scale model experience. As an example, perhaps an aerospace company needs to test a new wing shape. According to the similitude requirements the test must be carried out in a wind tunnel that can drop the temperature of the air to , such as the Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center. However, if a facility such as this one can't be used, perhaps due to cost constraints, the similitude requirements must be relaxed or the test redesigned to accommodate the limitation.  Classes  For a scale model to represent a prototype in a perfectly true manner, all the dimensionless quantities, or œÄ terms, must be equal for the scale model during the observational period and the prototype under the conditions the modeler desires to study. However, in many situations, designing a scale model that equates all the œÄ terms to the prototype is simply not possible due to lack of materials, cost restrictions, or limitations of testing facilities. In this case, concessions must be made for practical reasons to the similitude requirements. Depending on the phenomena being observed, perhaps some dimensionless quantities aren't of interest and thus can be ignored by the modeler and the results of the scale model can still safely be assumed to correspond to the prototype. An example of this from fluid dynamics is flow of a liquid in a horizontal pipe. Possible œÄ terms to consider in this situation are Reynolds number, Weber number, Froude number, and Mach number. For this flow configuration, however, no surface tension is involved, so the Weber number is inappropriate. Also, compression of the fluid is not applicable, so the Mach number can be disregarded. Finally, gravity is not responsible for the flow, so the Froude number can also be disregarded. This leaves the modeler with only the Reynolds number to worry about in terms of equating its values for the scale model and the prototype.Crowe, C., et al. 2010, p. 263 In general, scale models can be classified into three classes depending on the degree of similitude satisfaction they exhibit. To begin, a true model is one with complete similitude‚Äîthat is, all œÄ terms are equal for the scale model and the prototype. True models are difficult to realize in reality due to the many possible quantities the modeler must consider. As a result, modelers identify the important dimensionless quantities and construct a scale model that satisfies these. Important dimensionless quantities are called first- order dimensional requirements. A model that satisfies first-order similarity is called an adequate model. Finally, for scale models that fail to satisfy one or more of the first-order requirements, the name distorted model is given.Harris, H., et al. 1999, p. 56  Examples  Scale models are used by many fields for many different purposes. Some of the specific uses of scale models by specific fields are explained below in the examples. = Structural = This is a load confinement box from the University of Illinois, UC Structural engineering lab. It can impart six degrees of freedom on structural scale models.http://ceephotos.karcor.com/?s=load+and+confinement+boxAlthough structural engineering has been a field of study for thousands of years and many of the great problems have been solved using analytical and numerical techniques, many problems are still too complicated to understand in an analytical manner or the current numerical techniques lack real world confirmation. When this is the case, for example a complicated reinforced concrete beam-column-slab interaction problem, scale models can be constructed observing the requirements of similitude to study the problem. Many structural labs exist to test these structural scale models such as the Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory at the University of Illinois, UC. For structural engineering scale models, it is important for several specific quantities to be scaled according to the theory of similitude. These quantities can be broadly grouped into three categories: loading, geometry, and material properties. A good reference for considering scales for a structural scale model under static loading conditions in the elastic regime is presented in Table 2.2 of the book Structural Modeling and Experimental Techniques.Harris, H., et al. 1999, p. 62 Structural engineering scale models can use different approaches to satisfy the similitude requirements of scale model fabrication and testing. A practical introduction to scale model design and testing is discussed in the paper \\"Pseudodynamic Testing of Scaled Models\\".Kumar, et al. 1997, p. 1 = Aircraft = Scale model of a Douglas DC-3 in Finnair Airlines colors. Many airlines use model aircraft as advertisement items Model aircraft are divided into two main groups: static and flying models. Static Static model aircraft are commonly built using plastic, but wood, metal, card and paper can also be used. Models are sold painted and assembled, painted but not assembled (snap-fit), or unpainted and not assembled. The most popular types of aircraft to model are commercial airliners and military aircraft. Aircraft can be modeled in many \\"scales\\". The scale notation is the size of the model compared to the real, full-size aircraft called the \\"prototype\\". 1:8 scale will be used as an example; it is read as: \\"1 inch (or whatever measurement) on the model is equal (: means equal) to 8 inches on the real (prototype) airplane\\". Sometimes the scale notation is not used; it is simply stated: \\"my model is one eighth (1/8) scale\\", meaning \\"my model is one eighth the size of the real airplane\\" or \\"my model is one eight as large as the real airplane\\". Popular scales are, in order of size, 1:144, 1:72 (the most numerous), 1:48, 1:32, 1:24, 1:16, 1:8 and 1:4. Some European models are available at more metric scales such as 1:50. The highest quality models are made from injection-molded plastic or cast resin. Models made from Vacuum formed plastic are generally for the more skilled builder. More inexpensive models are made from heavy paper or card stock. Ready-made die-cast metal models are also very popular. As well as the traditional scales, die-cast models are available in 1:200, 1:250, 1:350, 1:400, 1:500 and 1:600 scale. These scales are usually reserved for civil airliners. Static aircraft scale modeling falls broadly into three categories: kit assembly, scratch-building, and collection of ready-made models. Scratch-builders tend to be the top echelon in terms of skill and craftsmanship. They tend to be the most discerning when it comes to accuracy and detail and they spend far more time on far fewer models than a kit assembler. Kit assemblers fall roughly into two categories: OOB (Out of box) and modified. Out of Box refers to the act of assembling a kit only from what is contained in the box supplied, whereas a Modifier employs after-market products such as alternative decals, photo- etched metal detail parts, and cast resin detail or conversion parts to enhance or change the model in some way. Collectors are concerned purely with the issue of theme, and are not really interested in personal construction as such. Aircraft modelers often fall into more than one category, as fancy takes them. The overwhelming majority of aircraft modelers concern themselves with depiction of real-life aircraft, but there is a smaller cadre of modelers who derive additional fun by 'bending' history a little by making models of aircraft that either never actually flew or existed, or by painting them in a color scheme that did not actually exist. This is commonly referred to as 'What-if' or 'Alternative' modeling, and the most common theme is 'Luftwaffe 1946' or 'Luftwaffe '46'. This theme stems from the idea of modeling German secret projects that never saw the light of day due to the close of World War II. This concept has been extended to include British, Russian, and US experimental projects that never made it into production. Flying Scale down model of Alaska Airlines Flying model aircraft are of two types: those constructed for aerodynamic research and those for recreation or aeromodeling. Aerodynamic models may be constructed for use in a wind tunnel or in free flight. Small-scale piloted aircraft are even constructed to test some aspect of a proposed full-size design, but these are not considered as models even though they may be accurate to scale. Recreational models are often made to resemble some real type. However the aerodynamic requirements of a small model are different from those of a full-size craft, so flying models are seldom fully accurate to scale. Most flying model aircraft can be placed in one of three groups: free flight, control line and radio controlled. Flying models can be built from scratch or from kits. Some kits take many hours to put together and some kits are almost ready to fly or ready to fly. = Plans- relief = With elements similar to miniature wargaming, building models and architectural models, a plan-relief is a means of geographical representation in relief as a scale model for military use, to visualise building projects on fortifications or campaigns involving fortifications. = Buildings = Model building for an HO scale railroad Most hobbyists who build models of buildings do so as part of a diorama to enhance their other models, such as a model railroad or model war machines. As a stand-alone hobby, building models are probably most popular among enthusiasts of construction toys such as Erector, Lego and K'Nex. Famous landmarks such as the Empire State Building, Big Ben and the White House are common subjects. Standard scales have not emerged in this hobby. Model railroaders use railroad scales for their buildings: HO scale (1:87), OO scale (1:76), N scale (1:160), and O scale (1:43). Lego builders use miniland scale (1:20) and minifig scale (1:48) and micro scale (1:192)In the Lego community, micro scale can refer to anything smaller than minifig scale (1:48), but 1:192 is occasionally set as a standard micro scale. This ratio is arrived at by scaling a person (6 feet) to the height of a Lego brick (3/8 inches). See Generally, the larger the building, the smaller the scale. Model buildings are commonly made from plastic, foam, balsa wood or paper. Card models are published in the form of a book, and some models are manufactured like 3-D puzzles. Professionally, building models are used by architects and salesmen. =Architectural= Model ships and castle Architecture firms usually employ model makers or contract model making firms to make models of projects to sell their designs to builders and investors. These models are traditionally hand-made, but advances in technology have turned the industry into a very high tech process than can involve Class IV laser cutters, five-axis CNC machines as well as rapid prototyping or 3D printing. Typical scales are 1:12, 1:24, 1:48, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, etc. =House portrait= Typically found in 1:50 scale and also called model house, model home or display house, this type of model is usually found in stately homes or specially designed houses. Sometimes this kind of model is commissioned to mark a special date like an anniversary or the completion of the architecture, or these models might be used by salesmen selling homes in a new neighborhood. = Buses and trucks = Typically found in 1:50 scale, most manufacturers of commercial vehicles and heavy equipment commission scale models made of die-cast metal as promotional items to give to prospective customers. These are also popular children's toys and collectibles. The major manufacturers of these items are Conrad and NZG in Germany. Corgi also makes some 1:50 models, as well as Dutch maker Tekno. Trucks are also found as diecast models in 1:43 scale and injection moulded kits (and children's toys) in 1:24 scale. Recently some manufacturers have appeared in 1:64 scale like Code 3.frame = Cars = Matchbox Chevrolet Tahoe, 1:43 Ford F-100, 1:25 Revell Monogram 1999 Ford Mustang Cobra, 1:18 Bburago 1987 Ferrari F40 Although the British scale for 0 gauge was first used for model cars made of rectilinear and circular parts, it was the origin of the European scale for cast or injection moulded model cars. MOROP's specification of 1:45 scale for European 0 does not alter the series of cars in 1:43 scale, as it has the widest distribution in the world. In America, a series of cars was developed from at first cast metal and later styrene models (\\"promos\\") offered at new- car dealerships to drum up interest. The firm Monogram, and later Tamiya, first produced them in a scale derived from the Architect's scale: 1:24 scale, while the firms AMT, Jo-Han, and Revell chose the scale of 1:25. Monogram later switched to this scale after the firm was purchased by Revell. Some cars are also made in 1:32 scale, and rolling toys are often made on the scale 1:64 scale. Chinese die-cast manufacturers have introduced 1/72 scale into their range. The smaller scales are usually die-cast cars and not the in the class as model cars. Except in rare occasions, Johnny Lightning and Ertl-made die- cast cars were sold as kits for buyers to assemble. Model cars are also used in car design. = Construction vehicles = right A model construction vehicle (or engineering vehicle) is a scale model or die-cast toy that represents a construction vehicle such as a bulldozer, excavator, crane, concrete pump, backhoe, etc. Construction vehicle models are almost always made in 1:50 scale, particularly because the cranes at this scale are often three to four feet tall when extended and larger scales would be unsuited for display on a desk or table. These models are popular as children's toys in Germany. In the US they are commonly sold as promotional models for new construction equipment, commissioned by the manufacturer of the prototype real-world equipment. The major manufacturers in Germany are Conrad and NZG, with some competition from Chinese firms that have been entering the market. = Railways = An HO scale model railroad HO scale locomotive showing size comparison with pencil. An N scale locomotive A propane fired 1:8 scale live steam train running on the Finnish Railway Museum's miniature track. Model trains come in a variety of scales, from 1:8 on the large end and 1:450 (T scale) on the small. Each scale has its own strengths and weaknesses, and fills a different niche in the hobby. The largest models are as much as long, the smallest a few centimeters. The most popular size is HO scale (1:87) and second is N scale (1:160). Model railways originally used the term gauge, which refers to the distance between the rails, just as full-size railways do. Although model railways were also built to different gauges, \\"standard gauge\\" in 1:1 scale railroads is 4' 8.5\\". Therefore, a model railway reduces that standard to scale. An HO scale model railway would have track that is 1/87 of 4' 8.5\\", or about 0.65\\" from rail to rail. Now it is more typical to refer to the scale of the model, and the term scale has replaced \\"gauge\\" in most usages. This is despite considerable confusion between countries as to the definition of 0 scale and N scale. Considerable confusion often arises when referring to \\"scale\\" and \\"gauge\\", especially as the words are sometimes used interchangeably. The word \\"scale\\" refers to the proportional size of the model; the word \\"gauge\\" applies to the measurement between the inside faces of the rails. To highlight this difference, consider the various gauges used in HO scale; A gauge of 16.5 mm is used to represent the \\"standard gauge\\" of (HO scale), a gauge of 12 mm is used to represent gauge (HOm) and the gauge (HOn3-1/2) and a gauge of 9 mm is used to represent a prototype gauge of . It is completely incorrect to refer to the mainstream scales as \\"HO gauge\\", \\"N gauge\\" or \\"Z gauge\\" The most popular scale to go with a given gauge was often derived at by the following roundabout process. German artisans would take strips of metal of standard metric size to make things to blueprints whose dimensions were in inches: hence \\"4 mm to the foot\\" yields the 1:76.2 size of the \\"OO scale\\". This British scale is anomalously used on the standard HO/OO scale (16.5 mm gauge from 3.5 mm/foot scale) tracks, however, because early electric motors weren't available commercially in smaller sizes. There are three different standards for the \\"O\\" scale, each of which uses tracks of 32 mm for the standard gauge. The American version continues a dollhouse scale of 1:48. It is sometimes called \\"quarter-gauge\\", as in \\"one-quarter-inch to the foot\\". The British version continued the pattern of sub-contracting to Germans; so, at 7 mm to the foot, it works out to a scale of 1:43.5. Later, MOROP, the European authority of model railroad firms, declared that the \\"O\\" gauge (still 32 mm) must use the scale of 1:45. That is, in Europe the below- chassis dimensions must be slightly towards 4 feet 6 inches, to allow wheel/tyre/splasher clearance for smaller than realistic curved sections. \\"Live steam\\" railways, that people actually ride on, are built in many scales, such as 1-1/2\\", 1\\", and 3/4 inches to the foot. Common gauges are 7-1/2\\" (Western US) and 7-1/4\\" (Eastern US & rest of the world), 5\\", 4-3/4\\". Smaller live steam gauges do exist, but as the scale gets smaller, pulling power decreases. One of the smallest gauges on which a live steam engine can pull a passenger is the now almost defunct 2-1/2-inch gauge. = Robots = Japanese firms have marketed toys and models of what are often called mecha, nimble humanoid fighting robots. The robots, which appear in animated shows (anime), are often depicted at a size between 15-20m in height, and so scales of 1:100 and 1:144 are common for these subjects, though other scales such as 1:72 are commonly used for robots and related subjects of different size. The most prolific manufacturer of mecha models is Bandai, whose Gundam kit lines were a strong influence in the genre in the 1980s. Even today, Gundam kits are the most numerous in the mecha modeling genre, usually with dozens of new releases every year. The features of modern Gundam kits, such as color molding and snap-fit construction, have become the standard expectations for other mecha model kits. Due to the fantasy nature of most anime robots, and the necessary simplicity of cel-animated designs, mecha models lend themselves well to stylized work, improvisations, and simple scratchbuilds. One of Gundam's contributions to the genre was the use of a gritty wartime backstory as a part of the fantasy, and so it is almost equally fashionable to build the robots in a weathered, beaten style, as would often be expected for AFV kits as to build them in a more stylish, pristine manner. = Rockets and spacecraft = Model rocket kits began as a development of model aircraft kits, yet the scale of 1:72 [V.close to 4 mm.::1foot] never caught on. Scales 1:48 and 1:96 are used. There are some rockets of scales 1:128, 1:144, and 1:200, but Russian firms put their large rockets in 1:288. Heller SA offers some models in the scale of 1:125. Science fiction space ships are heavily popular in the modeling community. Models based on ships from such franchises as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica are regularly sold and created in scales ranging from 1:24 for fighters and smaller ships to 1:1000, 1:1400, and 1:2500 for most main franchise ships, and up to 1:10000 for the larger Star Wars ships (for especially objects like the Death Stars and Super Star Destroyers, even smaller scales are used). Finemolds in Japan have recently released a series of high quality injection molded Star Wars kits in 1:72, and this range is supplemented by resin kits from Fantastic Plastic. = Living creatures = Scale models of people and animals are found in a wide variety of venues, and may be either single-piece objects or kits that must be assembled, usually depending on the purpose of the model. For instance, models of people as well as both domestic and wild animals are often produced for display in model cities or railroads to provide a measure of detail or realism, and scaled relative to the trains, buildings, and other accessories of a certain line of models. If a line of trains or buildings does not feature models of living creatures, those who build the models often buy these items separately from another line so they can feature people or animals. In other cases, scale model lines feature living creatures exclusively, often focusing on educational interests. Models of living creatures requiring assembly are not as common as single-piece units, but certainly not unheard of. One of the most prolific kinds of kits requiring assembly that feature living creatures are models of human and animal skeletons. Like their single-piece counterparts, such kits are often touted as being educational activities. Skeleton kits often have unique features such as glow-in-the-dark pieces or attachable internal organs. Again, dinosaurs are a popular subject for such models. There are also garage kits, which are often figures of anime characters in multiple parts that require assembly. = Ships and naval war-gaming = Pendon Museum's model of Madderport 1:1250 scale die-cast models of ships Scale down Model of Madagascar ship displayed at Surat castle (fort) In the first half of the 20th century, navies used hand-made models of warships for identification and instruction in a variety of scales. That of 1:500 was called \\"teacher scale.\\" Besides models made in 1:1200 and 1:2400 scales, there were also ones made to 1:2000 and 1:5000. Some, made in Britain, were labelled \\"1 inch to 110 feet\\", which would be 1:1320 scale, but aren't necessarily accurate. Michele Morciano says small scale ship models were produced in about 1905 linked to the wargaming rules and other publications of Fred T. Jane. The company that standardised on 1:1200 was Bassett-Lowke in 1908. The British Admiralty subsequently contracted with Bassett-Lowke and other companies and individual craftsmen to produce large numbers of recognition models, to this scale, in 1914‚Äì18. Just before the Second World War, the American naval historian (and science fiction author) Fletcher Pratt published a book on naval wargaming as could be done by civilians using ship models cut off at the waterline to be moved on the floors of basketball courts and similar locales. The scale he used was non-standard (reported as 1:666), and may have been influenced by toy ships then available, but as the hobby progressed, and other rule sets came into use, it was progressively supplemented by the series 1:600, 1:1200, and 1:2400. In Britain, 1:3000 became popular and these models also have come into use in the USA. These had the advantage of approximating the nautical mile as 120 inches, 60 inches, and 30 inches, respectively. As the knot is based on this mile and a 60-minute hour, this was quite handy. After the war, firms emerged to produce models from the same white metal used to make toy soldiers. Lines Bros. Ltd, a British firm, offered a tremendously wide range of waterline merchant and naval ships as well as dockyard equipment in the scale 1:1200 which were die-cast in Zamak. In the US, at least one manufacturer, of the wartime 1:1200 recognition models, Comet, made them available for the civilian market postwar, which also drove the change to this scale. In addition, continental European manufacturers and European ship book publishers had adopted the 1:1250 drawing scale because of its similar convenience in size for both models and comparison drawings in books. A prestige scale for boats, comparable to that of 1:32 for fighter planes, is 1:72, producing huge models, but there are very few kits marketed in this scale. There are now several clubs around the world for those who choose to scratch-build radio- controlled model ships and submarines in 1:72, which is often done because of the compatibility with naval aircraft kits. For the smaller ships, plank-on- frame or other wood construction kits are offered in the traditional shipyard scales of 1:96, 1:108, or 1:192 (half of 1:96). In injection-molded plastic kits, Airfix makes full-hull models in the scale the Royal Navy has used to compare the relative sizes of ships: 1:600. Revell makes some kits to half the scale of the US Army standard: 1:570. Some American and foreign firms have made models in a proportion from the Engineer's scale: \\"one-sixtieth-of-an- inch-to-the-foot\\", or 1:720. 1/700 scale Japanese destroyer Harusame (1935) plastic model kit released by Tamiya = Manned ships = Many research workers, hydraulics specialists and engineers have used scale models for over a century, in particular in towing tanks. Manned models are small scale models that can carry and be handled by at least one person on an open expanse of water. They must behave just like real ships, giving the shiphandler the same sensations. Physical conditions such as wind, currents, waves, water depths, channels, and berths must be reproduced realistically. Manned models are used for research (e.g. ship behaviour), engineering (e.g. port layout) and for training in shiphandling (e.g. maritime pilots, masters and officers). They are usually at 1:25 scale. = Tanks and wargaming = American Civil War miniature battle at the HMGS \\"Cold Wars\\" convention in Lancaster, PA Just before the 20th century, the British historian and science fiction author H. G. Wells published a book, Little Wars, on how to play at battles in miniature. His books use 54 mm lead figures, particularly those manufactured by Britains. His fighting system employed spring-loaded model guns that shot matchsticks. This use of physical mechanisms was echoed in the later games of Fred Jane, whose rules required throwing darts at ship silhouettes; his collection of data on the world's fleets was later published and became renowned. Dice have largely replaced this toy mayhem for consumers. For over a century, toy soldiers were made of white metal, a lead-based alloy, often in architect's scale-based ratios in the English-speaking countries, and called tin soldiers. After the Second World War, such toys were on the market for children but now made of a safe plastic softer than styrene. American children called these \\"army men\\". Many sets were made in the new scale of 1:40. A few styrene model kits of land equipment were offered in this and in 1:48 and 1:32 scales. However, these were swept away by the number of kits in the scale of 1:35. Those who continued to develop miniature wargaming preferred smaller scale models, the soldiers still made of soft plastic. Airfix particularly wanted people to buy 1:76 scale soldiers and tanks to go with \\"00\\" gauge train equipment. Roco offered 1:87 scale styrene military vehicles to go with \\"HO\\" gauge model houses. However, although there is no 1:72 scale model railroad, more toy soldiers are now offered in this scale because it is the same as the popular aircraft scale. The number of fighting vehicles in this scale is also increasing, although the number of auxiliary vehicles available is far fewer than in 1:87 scale. A more recent development, especially in wargaming of land battles, is 15 mm white metal miniatures, often referred to as 1:100. The use of 15 mm scale metals has grown quickly since the early 1990s as they allow a more affordable option over 28 mm if large battles are to be refought, or a large number of vehicles represented. The rapid rise in the detail and quality of castings at 15 mm scale has also helped to fuel their uptake by the wargaming community. Armies use smaller scales still. The US Army specifies models of the scale 1:285 for its sand table wargaming. There are metal ground vehicles and helicopters in this scale, which is a near \\"one-quarter-inch-to- six-feet\\" scale. The continental powers of NATO have developed the similar scale of 1:300, even though metric standardizers really don't like any divisors other than factors of 10, 5, and 2, so maps are not commonly offered in Europe in scales with a \\"3\\" in the denominator. Consumer wargaming has since expanded into fantasy realms, employing scales large enough to be painted in imaginative detail - so called \\"heroic\\" 28 mm figures, (roughly 1:64, or S scale). Firms that produce these make small production lots of white metal. Alternatively to the commercial models, some modelers also tend to use scraps to achieve home-made warfare models. While it doesn't always involve wargaming, some modelers insert realistic procedures, enabling a certain realism such as firing guns or shell deflection on small scale models. = Engines = Kits for building an engine model are available, especially for kids. The most popular are the internal combustion, steam, jet, and Stirling model engine. Usually they move using an electric motor or a hand crank, and many of them have a transparent case to show the internal process in action. = Miniatures in contemporary art = Daniel Dorall, Asylum, 2005, cardboard, sand, hydrocryl, plastic, 20 √ó 10 √ó 4 cm Miniatures and model kits are used in contemporary art whereby artists use both scratch built miniaturizations or commercially manufactured model kits to construct a dialogue between object and viewer. The role of the artist in this type of miniature is not necessarily to re-create an historical event or achieve naturalist realism, but rather to use scale as a mode of articulation in generating conceptual or theoretical exploration. Political, conceptual, and architectural examples are provided by noted artists such as Bodys Isek Kingelez, Jake and Dinos Chapman (otherwise known as the Chapman Brothers), Ricky Swallow, Shaun Wilson, Sven Christoffersen, or the Psikhelekedana artists from Mozambique, James Casebere, Oliver Boberg, and Daniel Dorall.

In 1790, the ship was wrecked on the reef, south east of Kingston Pier, in Slaughter Bay, Norfolk Island. Construction Sirius had been converted from the merchantman Berwick. There has been confusion over the early history of Berwick. A note about her by future New South Wales governor Philip Gidley King, describing her as a former 'East country man', was interpreted for many years as relating to the East Indies trade; however, analysis of the maritime nomenclature of the time suggests that this description referred instead to ships participating in the Baltic trade. Berwick was likely built in 1780 by Christopher Watson and Co. of Rotherhithe, who also built another ship of the First Fleet, Prince of Wales.Henderson and Stanbury, p. 40 Berwick had a burthen of 511 tons (bm) and, after being burnt in a fire, was bought and rebuilt by the Royal Navy in November 1781, retaining her original name. As HMS Berwick The newly purchased vessel was fitted out and coppered at Deptford Dockyard between December 1781 and April 1782, for a total sum of ¬£6,152.11s.4d. When completed she carried 10 guns, four 6-pounder long guns, and six 18-pounder carronades. She was commissioned for service under her first commander, Lieutenant Bayntun Prideaux in January 1782, and went out to North America later that year. She spent the last part of the American War of Independence there, transferring to the West Indies in June 1784. Paid off in February 1785 she was initially laid up before being fitted for sea between September and December 1786 for service with the First Fleet. She was nominally rated as a sixth-rate, allowing her to be commanded by a post-captain, though she retained her armament of only 10 guns, and on 12 October 1786 Berwick was renamed Sirius, after the southern star Sirius.Henderson and Stanbury, p. 38 Voyage of the First Fleet Sirius sailed from The Motherbank, Ryde, Isle of Wight on 13 May 1787 as the flagship of the eleven-vessel First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip (Governor-designate of the new colony). Phillip transferred to the Armed Tender HMS Supply at Cape Town, with Second Captain John Hunter remaining in command of Sirius. Also on board were Royal Marine Major Robert Ross, who would be responsible for colony security and surgeons George Bouchier Worgan and Thomas Jamison. Midshipman Daniel Southwell recorded that Sirius was carrying the Larcum Kendall K1 chronometer used by Captain James Cook on his second and third voyages around the world.Correspondence, Daniel Southwell, Midshipman HMS Sirius, 12 July 1788. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1978, p.685 She arrived in Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, two days after Supply, according to the journals of Hunter Digitised image ofpage 61 and First Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) William Bradley Digitised images of page 57 and page 58 The 252-day voyage had gone via Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope and covered more than . It was quickly decided that Botany Bay was unsuitable for a penal settlement and an alternative location was sought. While waiting to move, a large gale arose preventing any sailing; during this period the French expeditionary fleet of Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de Lap√©rouse arrived in Botany Bay. The colony was established at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson when Governor Phillip arrived on 26 January aboard Supply. Sirius arrived the following day. Lap√©rouse, which was returned to Europe by HMS Sirius. The British cordially received the French. Siriuss captains, through their officers, offered assistance and asked if Lap√©rouse needed supplies. However the French leader and the British commanders never met personally. Lap√©rouse also took the opportunity to send his journals, some charts and some letters back to Europe with Sirius. After obtaining wood and fresh water, the French left on 10 March for New Caledonia, Santa Cruz, the Solomons, the Louisiades, and the western and southern coasts of Australia. The French fleet and all on board were never seen again. The documents carried by Sirius would be its only testament. Decades later it was discovered that Lap√©rouse's expedition had been shipwrecked on the island of Vanikoro. Sirius left Port Jackson under the command of Hunter on 2 October 1788, when she was sent back to the Cape of Good Hope to get flour and other supplies. The complete voyage, which took more than seven months to complete, returned just in time to save the near- starving colony. In 1789, she was refitted in Mosman Bay, which was originally named Great Sirius Cove after the vessel. The name lives on in the adjacent Sirius Cove (formerly \\"Little Sirius Cove\\"). On 19 March 1790, Sirius was wrecked on a reef at Norfolk Island while landing stores. Among those who witnessed the ship's demise from shore was Thomas Jamison, the surgeon for the penal settlement. Jamison would eventually become Surgeon-General of New South Wales. Siriuss crew was stranded on Norfolk Island until they were rescued on 21 February 1791. Hunter returned to England aboard Waaksamheid where he faced court martial and was honourably acquitted. He was appointed as Phillip's successor as Governor of New South Wales in February 1795, though he did not return to the colony until September. One of the sailors on Sirius, Jacob Nagle, wrote a first-hand account of the ship's last voyage, wreck, and the crew's stranding. With the settlement in New South Wales still on the brink of starvation, the loss of Sirius left the colonists with only one supply ship. Legacy Mosman. Anchor from HMS Sirius in Sydney. Monument erected in memory of HMS Sirius at Appley Park, Ryde, Isle of Wight, UK. The fleet sailed from offshore of this location. Many artefacts have been retrieved from the Sirius wreck. They include three anchors and two carronades. Objects are displayed in the Norfolk Island Museum. Another anchor, as well as a cannon, are on display in Macquarie Place, Sydney. Other Sirius artefacts including an anchor can be viewed at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. A detailed 1:24 scale model of Sirius is displayed in the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. Small models of all the First Fleet ships are displayed in the Museum of Sydney. The Sirius wrecksite is protected by the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List. An Urban Transit Authority First Fleet ferry was named after Sirius in 1984.Sydney Ferries Fleet Facts Transport for NSW Bas-relief memorials to the ship were erected in the Sydney suburb of Mosman, Norfolk Island and Ryde, Isle of Wight in 1989, 1990 and 1991 respectively.

Origins Historically the tanist was chosen from among the heads of the roydammna or \\"righdamhna\\" (literally, those of kingly material) or, alternatively, among all males of the sept, and elected by them in full assembly. The eligibility was based on patrilineal relationship, which meant the electing body and the eligibles were agnates with each other. The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon male-line descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it.In Early Irish laws and institution (1934) Eoin MacNeill stated that, according to the annal evidence, tanistry originated only about century after the Anglo-Norman invasion, p. 148. A story about Cormac mac Airt refers to his eldest son as his tanist. Following his murder by a member of the Deisi, another roydammna, Eochaid Gonnat, succeeded as king. In Ireland, the tanistry continued among the dominant dynasties, as well as lesser lords and chieftains, until the mid-16th/early 17th century when it was replaced by English common law.Case of Tanisrry (1608), Davis 28 180 E.R 516McGinty,M. 2017 Tanistry, primogeniture and divided clans https://soundcloud.com/history- hub/matthew-mcginty-tanistry-primogeniture-and-divided-clans?in=history- hub/sets/2017-tudor-and-stuart-ireland When in 1943 Ireland appointed its first new Chief Herald, it did not reintroduce tanistry. The state granted courtesy recognition to Irish chiefs based on primogeniture from the last known chief. The Gaels exported tanistry and other customs to those parts of Scotland which they controlled after AD 400. The Picts (the other indigenous people of today's Scotland) did not share the succession principles of their neighbours of Ireland and Scottish Gaels. No female succession, or male succession via female lines, is allowed in the Irish and Gaelic succession model. By contrast, Pictish succession often used links through females (maternal grandson was apparently preferred heir of grandfather; and/or maternal nephew of uncle in Pictish custom). The royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective agnatic or male line of the Siol Alpein (House of Alpin) until the accession of King Malcolm II in 1005. This monarch was the first to introduce the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland. He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the elective law, which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the throne. Since Malcolm had only daughters, he also introduced the right of female-line succession in Scotland. This gave rise to conflict by competitors for generations thereafter. The Irish monarchies, for their part, never at any stage allowed for female line succession. Candidates and functions The king or chief held office for life and was required by custom to be of full age, in possession of all his faculties and without any remarkable blemish of mind or body. At the same time, and subject to the same conditions, a tanist or next heir to the Monarchy was elected, who if the king died or became disqualified, at once became king. Typically a former king's son became tanist (sometimes the son of the king simultaneously elected, however perhaps more often a son of a rival branch of the dynasty), but not because the system of primogeniture was in any way recognised; indeed, the only principle adopted was that the dignity of chieftainship should descend to the eldest and most worthy agnate of the last ruler. (Note this still disqualified many in the clan, as most clansmen, being clients, were not related to the ruling line, patrilineally or otherwise.) The flag of Ulster with the Red Hand. One of the most common rules for qualification as a roydammna was that a candidate had to be a member of the previous chief's \\"derbfhine\\", a kindred including all descended in the male line from a common great-grandfather. However it was often restricted to the chief's gelfhine, a fine descended from one common (patrilineal) grandfather. This meant that the group became highly exclusive, keeping the kingship within the dynasty. Many in the wider clan might be reduced to gentry or peasant status (though they might share the surname). These features make tanistry an agnatic succession mode, and a succession by appointment, as it was an elective monarchy. Tanistry evades the basic requirement of the hereditary monarchy, i.e. that the outcome of the succession is predictable, up to the identity of successor and next heirs, by genealogy. The downside of the large group of eligibles was that increases in roydammna in each generation might lead to internecine dynastic civil war.See e.g. Such was the case among the descendants of King and High King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088‚Äì1156). His dynasty, the U√≠ Bri√∫in, had successfully ruled as Kings of Connacht since at least the mid-5th century. Their increasing consolidation via the annexation of the Kingdoms of Mide and Dublin, plus suborning neighboring states and lordships to vassalage, led to Tairrdelbach becoming the first of his dynasty to become High King. Competition between Tairrdelbach's many sons caused corrosive warfare among at least four competing main lines, in addition to allied lordships' and kingdoms' striving for the main chance. Coupled with the incursions of the Normans from 1169 onwards, this fragmented √ì Conchobhar rule. By the mid-13th century, they were reduced to ruling a fraction of their former patrimony. Another example of Derbfhine or Roydammna proliferation comes from the Annals of Connacht. It states that at the Second Battle of Athenry in August 1316, in addition to King Tadc √ì Cellaig of U√≠ Maine, \\"there fell with him ... twenty-eight men who were entitled to succeed to the kingship of U√≠ Maine.\\"Annals of Connacht 1316.5 Further points This system often led to rotation among the most prominent branches of the clan or the reigning house, particularly in the Middle Ages. Tanistry, though not necessarily intended to be so, was perceived to create balance between branches of family. A quite usual pattern was that the chief (king, lord) was succeeded by his tanist, elected earlier and from another branch than that which the incumbent chief belonged to. Perhaps simultaneously upon that succession, a tanist was elected from another branch, to fill the position vacated by the one now risen to chieftainship. He may have come from the branch to which the deceased belonged. The next vacancy would be handled in a similar way. If a chieftain attempted to have his own son (or brother) chosen over a representative of another branch, the electors were outraged, as they feared subjugation to one branch. In 1296, the Bruce candidate to inherit the crown of Scotland pleaded the traditional tanistry in his favor. In terms of primogeniture, he was from a cadet branch of the old royal descent, and thus would not have succeeded. The idea of rotation and balance (and his seniority in physical age and experience) made him a credible competitor. A Pictish aspect was that both the House of Balliol and Bruce descended through female lines from the royal house, and were allowed to present candidacy. Bruce also claimed tanistry through a female line. (This may be an indication that in Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. The judicial resolution of the succession quarrel, directed by the English king, favoured the Balliols on the basis of primogeniture. Subsequent political events reverted that result to a more \\"clannish-tradition\\" direction. Robert the Bruce, grandson of the candidate who argued for tanistry, ascended the throne despite descending from a rather junior cadet line of the original Royal House. All future monarchs of Scotland after that succeeded by the rights of the Bruce.) Tanistry as the system of succession left the headship open to the ambitious. It was a frequent source of strife both in families and between the clans, but it was conversely quasi-democratic. Tanistry was abolished by a legal decision during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who later was named James I of England and Ireland. The English land law was substituted. The rules of succession of the House of Alpin of Scottish monarchs (a dynasty legendarily of mixed Pictish and Gaelic origin) and their successors, abided by tanistry rules until at least 1034. They also used them in certain successions in the 1090s, and tanistry was used as an argument in succession litigation as late as the 1290s. A similar system operated in Wales, where under Welsh law any of the sons or brothers of the king could be chosen as the edling or heir to the kingdom. Current political uses The word is preserved in the government of the Republic of Ireland, where the prime minister is the Taoiseach while the deputy prime minister is the T√°naiste. Uses in literature and popular culture * The concept of the tanist or substitute for the sacred king was incorporated as a central element in Sir James Frazer's study of European mythologies, The Golden Bough. * The figure of the tanist has appeared in modernist poetry, such as T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land. * The tanist influenced Robert Graves' interpretation of The Greek Myths (1955) and The White Goddess. * In the Deryni novel The Bishop's Heir by Katherine Kurtz, the character Dhugal MacArdry is Tanist of Clan MacArdry. After his actual parentage becomes more widely known (he is the only child of the secret marriage between then-Lord Duncan McLain and Lady Maryse MacArdry) late in The King's Justice, Dhugal's gillie Ciard O Ruane tells Kelson and Cardiel: \\"I canna' speak for the clan, Sair, but young Dhugal is my chief, an' will be sae long as he lives, whether he's Caulay's son or only his grandson. Th' borders inherit by tanistry. Dhugal was chosen as th' next chief, an' could hae been, even if he'd been nae blood relative to Caulay at all. I dinna' think yon Duke of Cassan [Duncan] can pass his title in th' same manner, however.\\" Blood tanistry Blood tanistry is the principle that \\"the most talented male member of the royal dynasty should inherit the throne, commonly by murder and war\\".Fletcher, Joseph. 1979. \\"Turco-Mongolian Monarchic Traditions in the Ottoman Empire\\", Harvard Ukrainian Studies 3: 236‚Äì251 It is also used to describe the practical ramifications of the Turco-Mongol, as well as other Central Asian steppe nomad, principles of inheritance and succession. Because all male members of the royal clan are considered to have equally legitimate claims on power, the ruler is the individual who eliminates competitors and re-subjugates the rest of the state formation. The structure may be determined by bonds of personal loyalty to the ruler, which are considered to be dissolved on the ruler's death.

The riverines warned locals of the new curfew for several days before seizing the boats of repeat curfew offenders A curfew is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply. Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their houses or homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, an au pair is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening. Curfews are a common element of control used in martial law, though curfews can also be implemented for public safety in the event of a disaster or crisis. Etymology The word \\"curfew\\" comes from the Old French phrase \\"couvre-feu\\", which means \\"cover fire\\". It was later adopted into Middle English as \\"curfeu\\", which later became the modern \\"curfew\\". Its original meaning refers to a law made by William the Conqueror that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings. Historical The first formal \\"curfew order\\" was introduced in 1918 by the British board of trade, which ordered shops and entertainment establishments to extinguish their lights by 10:30 p.m. in order to save fuel during World War I Types # An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the Northeast Blackout of 2003, the 2005 civil unrest in France, the 2010 Chile earthquake, the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and the 2014 Ferguson unrest), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as Japanese-American university students on the West Coast of the United States during World War II, African- Americans in many towns during the time of Jim Crow laws, or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the United States since the 1980s; see below. # An order by the legal guardians of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day. # An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or nanny. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time. # A daily requirement for guests to return to their hostel before a specified time, usually in the evening or night. # In baseball, a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the American League the curfew rule for many years decreed that no inning could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games). # In aeronautics, night flying restrictions may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of aircraft noise on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the London airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, which operate under the Quota Count system. # In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a \\"curfew\\" time, also known as \\"last orders\\".

Movement and curfew pass, issued under the authority of the British Military Commander, East Palestine, 1946 =Australia= On the 17th August 2011, a nighttime curfew was imposed on children who had run amok in the streets of Victoria after repeating youth offenses. On 2nd August 2020, following the surge of COVID-19 cases in Victoria, especially in Melbourne, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of disaster across the state and imposed stage 4 lockdown in Metropolitan Melbourne. The new measures included nighttime curfew, which was implemented across Melbourne from 20:00 to 05:00 (AEST). The restrictions came into effect at 18:00 (6 pm) and lasted until 28 September 2020 (5 am). =Belgium= On 17 October 2020, due to surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Belgium, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo announce a nationwide curfew from midnight to 05:00 am local time. The curfew is imposed on 19 October 2020 and will last for four weeks. The government also announce the closure of cafes, bars and restaurants for one month and alcohol sales will be banned after 8:00 pm local time. =Egypt= On 28 January 2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President Hosni Mubarak declared a country- wide military enforced curfew. However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners. On the second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President Mohamed Morsi who declared a curfew in Port Said, Isma√Ølia, and Suez, three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew, organizing football tournaments and street festivals, prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew. =France= On 14 October 2020, following the surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths in France that threatens to overhelm hospital, French President Emmanuel Macron declares a national state of public health emergency for the second time and impose a nighttime curfew in √éle-de-France region that includes Paris, as well as Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Rouen, Saint-Etienne, and Toulouse. The curfew begins from 09:00 pm to 06:00 am local time (CEST) (08:00 pm to 05:00 am CET) and implemented from 17 October 2020 and will last to four weeks. Under the rules, people in those cities cannot leave their homes unless for essential reasons, and anyone who violates the curfew would face a fine of 135 euros ($158.64) for the first offence. A second offence would bring a far steeper fine of 1,500 euros, or around $1,762. =Iceland= Under Iceland's Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92), children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00 p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00 p.m.), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer. Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Police are empowered to declare and enforce a Police Curfew in any police area for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order under the Police Ordinance. Under the emergency regulations of the Public Security Ordinance, the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a Curfew Pass from a police station to travel during a curfew. Enforcing a curfew in Hebron, 1969 =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom's 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success, the High Court ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour. In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the curfew bell is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the parish church to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from Morpeth Clock Tower. In Chertsey, it is rung at 8pm, from Michaelmas to Lady Day. A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled \\"Blanche Heriot. A legend of old Chertsey Church\\" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem \\"Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight\\". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday. At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serves its original function. =United States= Juvenile curfews Curfew law in the United States is usually a matter of local ordinance (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the Constitution guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's 1st, 4th, 5th or 14th Amendment rights. Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state and even by county or municipality. In some cities, there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers. The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility, but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address vandalism, shootings, and property crimes, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address underage drinking, drunk driving and teenage pregnancy. Parents can be fined, charged or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the \\"juvenile delinquent\\" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include: *accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent; *going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity; *engaging in a lawful employment activity or; *involved in an emergency; Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines. A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years. However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite. For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.The Curfew Myth, Ivonne Roman There are also concerns about racial profiling. In response to concerns about racial profiling, Montgomery County, Maryland passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening. Mall curfews Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times, unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times. Such policies are known as mall curfews. Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as parental escort policies. Curfews for all States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely inclement weather or political unrest. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as elected officials, law enforcement personnel, first responders, health care workers, and the mass media. However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration. That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset. In 2015, the city of Baltimore enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the 2015 Baltimore protests. In 2020, citywide curfews were enacted in major cities all across the country due to protests regarding the killing of George Floyd. Countywide curfews were enacted for Los Angeles County, California and Alameda County, California as well. Arizona enacted a statewide curfew.

J. Auchmuty, 'Hunter, John (1737‚Äì1821)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, MUP, 1966, pp 566‚Äì572. Retrieved 12 August 2009 Both a sailor and a scholar, he explored the Parramatta River as early as 1788, and was the first to surmise that Tasmania might be an island. As governor, he tried to combat serious abuses by the military in the face of powerful local interests led by John MacArthur. Hunter's name is commemorated in historic locations such as Hunter Valley and Hunter Street, Sydney. Family and early life John Hunter was born in Leith, Scotland, the son of William Hunter, a captain in the merchant service, and Helen, n√©e Drummond, daughter of J. Drummond and niece of George Drummond, several-time lord provost of Edinburgh. As a boy Hunter was sent to live with an uncle in the town of King's Lynn in Norfolk, where, and also at Edinburgh, he received the classical education of the time. Hunter was sent to the University of Edinburgh, but soon left it to join the navy as a captain's servant to Thomas Knackston on HMS Grampus in May 1754. Naval career =Seven Years' War= In 1755 Hunter was enrolled as able seaman on HMS Centaur, became a midshipman and served on and then . While aboard Neptune he was present at the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, and afterwards served during cruises off Brest in 1758 and the capture of Quebec in 1759. Serving aboard Neptune at this time as her first lieutenant was John Jervis, who became an acquaintance of Hunter. Hunter spent the rest of the Seven Years' War as midshipman on several of Admiral Philip Durell's flagships, serving aboard HMS Royal Anne, and the 100-gun , the latter in the Bay of Biscay until the Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1763. Hunter passed examinations and qualified for promotion to lieutenant in February 1760. (He was not, however, appointed lieutenant until 1780.) Hunter remained active in the navy during the years of peace, going out to Newfoundland aboard the frigate and then serving as master's mate aboard HMS Launceston during her time in North America in 1767 with the fleet under Commodore Samuel Hood. Hood gave Hunter an acting-order as master in 1768, and after passing his exams with Trinity House in 1769, Hunter had the order confirmed. His first appointment was to the 28-gun for service in the West Indies. Hunter spent his time there making charts and plans of parts of the coast and of the Spanish fortifications at Havana, which he sent back to the Admiralty. Carysfort was nearly lost after running aground on Martyr Reef in the Gulf of Florida in 1771, while being sailed by a pilot, but Hunter's exertions allowed her to be saved with the loss of her masts and guns. =Service in the East Indies= Hunter served as master of in the East Indies between 1772 and 1775, after which he became master of . The Kent was at this time commanded by Captain John Jervis, Hunter's companion from HMS Neptune. Jervis took Hunter with him to his next command, . Also serving aboard Foudroyant at this time was Evan Nepean, then the ship's purser, but later a leading civil servant and First Secretary to the Admiralty. From Foudroyant Hunter was moved into in 1776, at the request of Admiral Lord Howe, who was then going out to North America as commander-in-chief of the fleet, with Eagle as his flagship. =American War of Independence= When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Hunter served under Howe for the duration of his time in command, acting virtually as master of the fleet. He was active in the Chesapeake raid and the expeditions on the Delaware, as well as the defence of Sandy Hook. On Howe's recall, his reputation by now stale with the Sandwich administration, Hunter was not able to have his request to be made lieutenant honoured. Instead he joined the 74-gun as a volunteer in 1779, under her captain, Keith Stewart. He was appointed lieutenant of HMS Union by Sir Charles Hardy, but the Admiralty refused to confirm the appointment and Hunter returned to the Berwick as a volunteer in 1780, and went out the West Indies. There he received a commission from the commander in chief, Sir George Rodney. Hunter returned to England aboard the Berwick in 1781, and was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August that year. Howe appointed him third lieutenant of his flagship in 1782, and was advanced to first lieutenant by the time she took part in the relief of Gibraltar and the Battle of Cape Spartel. Following these engagements Hunter was appointed to his first command, that of the 14-gun sloop HMS Marquis de Seignelay, on 12 November 1782. =First Fleet= When the preparation of the First Fleet was in progress, Lord Howe, by then first lord of the admiralty, arranged for Hunter to be promoted to post captain on 15 December 1786, and appointed to command . The fleet was under the overall command of Commodore Arthur Phillip who was going out to find and be governor of the new colony of New South Wales. Hunter carried a dormant commission as successor to Phillip if he should have died or was absent. Explorations around Australia and Tasmania Captain John Hunter, Governor of New South Wales, 1801 The expedition arrived in Port Jackson in January 1788. Hunter led an expedition to explore the Parramatta River early in 1788. This expedition explored and made soundings as far as Iron Cove, Five Dock Bay and Hen and Chicken Bay on the Parramatta River. The Sir William Dixson Research Library at the State Library of New South Wales holds the original copy of the chart of the expedition, entitled \\"Chart of the coasts and harbours of Botany-Bay, Port-Jackson and Broken-Bay, as survey'd by Capt.n John Hunter of H.M.S. Sirius\\". The expedition was significant because it may have marked the first contact to take place between the British and the Indigenous owners of the land, the Wangal Clan, in 1788. William Bradley's log says that this contact took place while Hunter was having breakfast and is remembered in the name of the suburb, Breakfast Point. Hunter was ordered to the Cape of Good Hope for supplies in October 1788. He sailed around Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope, and from there back to New South Wales in May 1789, thus circumnavigating the globe. The voyage was made more difficult by leaky state of the ship, which rendered continual pumping necessary. Sirius was then refitted and sent to Norfolk Island with a large party of convicts, but was caught in a violent storm while anchored there. She was driven onto a coral reef and wrecked. A number of the crew returned to Port Jackson aboard the brig , the remainder, including Hunter, waited for nearly at year on the island before being taken off. Hunter and some of his men returned to England aboard the chartered Dutch vessel Waakzaamheid after a long and arduous voyage. Finally arriving at Portsmouth in April 1792, Hunter was court-martialled for the loss of the Sirius but was honourably acquitted. Hunter then prepared for publication his interesting An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island, With the Discoveries That Have Been Made in New South Wales and the Southern Ocean Since the Publication of Phillip's Voyage, published at the beginning of 1793. An abridged edition appeared later in the same year. In the first edition of this work is found the earliest reference to the possibility of there being a strait between the mainland and Tasmania. On page 126 Hunter says: \\"There is reason thence to believe, that there is in that space either a very deep gulf, or a straight, which may separate Van Diemen's Land from New Holland.\\" The French Revolutionary Wars having broken out during Hunter's time in England, he went to sea again as a volunteer aboard the 100-gun , the flagship of his old patron Lord Howe. Hunter was present at the Glorious First of June on 1 June 1794, and remained in the ship until 1795. With Arthur Phillip's resignation from the governorship of New South Wales in July 1793, Hunter had applied for the position in October and was appointed governor in January 1794. Various delays occurred, and it was not until February 1795 that he was able to sail. Hunter arrived at Sydney on 7 September 1795 on HMS Reliance and took up the office of governor on 11 September 1795. Governorship Hunter's difficulties began before he arrived back in Sydney. Phillip left the colony in 1793, at the end of his term as governor, and for the following two years the military were in complete control. During the lieutenant-governorship of Francis Grose, who unmercifully exploited the convicts, a great traffic in alcoholic spirits sprang up, on which there was an enormous profit for the officers concerned. They had obtained the control of the courts and the management of the lands, public stores, and convict labour. Hunter realised that these powers had to be restored to the civil administration, a difficult task. And in John Macarthur he had an opponent who would ruthlessly defend his commercial interests. Hunter found himself practically helpless. A stronger man might have sent the officers home under arrest, but had Hunter attempted to do so he likely would have precipitated the rebellion which took place in William Bligh's time. Anonymous letters were even sent to the home authorities charging Hunter with participation in the very abuses he was striving to prevent. In spite of Hunter's vehement defence of the charges made against him, he was recalled in a dispatch dated 5 November 1799 from the Duke of Portland, one of the three secretaries of state. Hunter acknowledged this dispatch on 20 April 1800, and left for England on 28 September 1800, handing over the government to Lieutenant-Governor Philip Gidley King. When Hunter arrived he endeavoured to vindicate his character with the authorities but was given no opportunity. Hunter was obliged to state his case in a long pamphlet printed in 1802, Governor Hunter's Remarks on the Causes of the Colonial Expense of the Establishment of New South Wales. Hints for the Reduction of Such Expense and for Reforming the Prevailing Abuses, which has become a valuable document in early Australian history. Hunter explored and opened up the country near Sydney, and also encouraged the explorations of Matthew Flinders and George Bass. A contemporary, midshipman Daniel Southwell described Hunter as \\"devoid of stiff pride, most accomplished in his profession, and, to sum up all, a worthy man.\\"Correspondence, Daniel Southwell, Midshipman HMS Sirius, 5 May 1788. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1978, p.684 But the circumstances in which he was placed made it very difficult for him to be completely successful as a governor. As his successor Philip Gidley King said, his conduct was \\"guided by the most upright intentions\\", and he was \\"most shamefully deceived by those on whom he had every reason to depend for assistance, information, and advice.\\" Of his sojourn in the colony Hunter said that he \\"could not have had less comfort, although he would certainly have had greater peace of mind, had he spent the time in a penitentiary\\". His service as Governor was ultimately recognised through the grant of an annual pension of ¬£300, approved by then-Prime Minister Henry Addington in October 1802.Bladen 1979, p.854 Hunter continued his interest in Australia long after he left it, and the suggested reforms in his pamphlet were of much value. When the platypus was first seen by Europeans in 1798, a pelt and sketch were sent back to the United Kingdom by John Hunter. Later life and legacy St John's Church Gardens In summer 1804 Hunter was given command of the 74-gun , serving with the fleet off Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. While sailing out of Torbay on the evening of 24 November, a sudden fog came down. The ships of the fleet, unaware of each other's positions and their own location became disorganised. Hunter twice narrowly avoided colliding with other ships, but ran aground at 8pm on the cliff near Paignton, and soon afterwards bilged. A gale then struck the area, and with Venerable fast going to pieces, her crew were evacuated with little loss by HMS Impetueux. Hunter again underwent a court-martial, and was again fully acquitted. Hunter was promoted to rear-admiral on 2 October 1807, and then to vice-admiral on 31 July 1810 but never hoisted his flag at sea. Vice-Admiral John Hunter spent his final years in his home town of Leith, living at 6 Cassels Place.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1819-20 He died at his London home at Judd Street, New Road, Hackney, London on 13 March 1821. His tomb can be seen in the churchyard of St John-at-Hackney. The Hunter River and Hunter Region north of Sydney are both named after him, as is the suburb of Hunters Hill in Sydney, and (partly) the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. In 1986 he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post.$1 stamp (image) He retired to his home town of Leith and lived at a then-new Georgian house at 5 Cassels Place, part of the still extant Georgian terrace at the foot of Leith Walk, and now renumbered as 43 Leith Walk.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1810 Memorials A bust of Hunter was placed by the Australian government at the north end of The Shore in Leith in 1996.

Located on a Lake Victoria peninsula, approximately southwest of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, it was once the seat of government for the Protectorate of Uganda prior to independence, in 1962. Entebbe is the location of Entebbe International Airport, Uganda's largest commercial and military airport, best known for the dramatic rescue of 100 hostages kidnapped by the resistance group of the PFLP-EO and Revolutionary Cells (RZ) organizations. Entebbe is also the location of State House, the official office and residence of the President of Uganda. Etymology The word came from Luganda language e ntebe which means 'seat' / 'chair'. Entebbe was a cultural site for Mamba clan and it was called entebbe za Mugula and is now the location of the official office and residence of the President of Uganda, as it was for British governors before independence. Entebbe was the former seat of power in the country now replaced by Kampala. Location Entebbe sits on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. The town is situated in Wakiso District, approximately south of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city.

History \\"Entebbe\\", in the local Luganda language, means a \\"seat\\" and was probably named that because it was the place where a Baganda chief sat to adjudicate legal cases. It first became a British colonial administrative and commercial centre in 1893 when Sir Gerald Portal, a colonial Commissioner, used it as a base.Britannica, Entebbe, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 Port Bell went on to become Kampala's harbour. Although no ships dock there now, there is still a jetty, which was used by Lake Victoria ferries. Entebbe International Airport, the main international airport of Uganda, has been the site of some well known events, making it famous in Europe and abroad. It was from this airport that Queen Elizabeth II departed Africa to return to England in 1952 when she learned of her father's death and that she had become Queen. The airport was the scene of a hostage situation and a rescue operation ending on 4 July 1976, when soldiers from the Sayeret Matkal, Paratroopers Brigade and Golani Brigade units of the Israeli Army freed over 100 hostages following a hijacking by a group of Palestinian and German militia. The city of Entebbe also hosted final resolution talks to end the M23 rebellion.

It is often followed by an \\"amen\\". Biblical origin These words are quoted from a command of the risen Jesus in the Great Commission: \\"Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\\" (Matthew 28:19); a small minority of other translations read, \\"into the name\\". Whereas some have argued that Matthew 28:19 was an interpolation on account of its absence from the first few centuries of early Christian quotations, scholars largely accept the passage as authentic due to its supporting manuscript evidence and that it does appear to be quoted in the Didache (7:1-3)Everett Ferguson, Baptism in the Early Church, 2013, 134-5 or at least reflected in the Didache as part of a common tradition from which both Matthew and the Didache emerged.Sim, David C., and Boris Repschinski, eds. Matthew and his Christian contemporaries. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008, 124-5. Use in baptism According to the doctrines of Roman Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, and most forms of Protestantism, such as Lutheranism and Anglicanism, a baptism is not valid if the Trinitarian formula is not used in the administration of that sacrament. Consequently, they may not recognize religious communities that baptize without this formula ‚Äì e.g. Unitarians, Branhamists, Frankists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Oneness Pentecostals, all of whom deny the Trinity ‚Äì as Christian religions. This is also the case with baptisms within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). Although LDS members baptize with the same Trinitarian formula, they reject the Nicene Trinitarian conception and regard the three persons of the Trinity as being distinct personages united not in substance, but in dominion and purpose.Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Godhead, http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Godhead Other faiths (Frankists, Oneness Pentecostals and Branhamists in particular) use the formula \\"In the name of Jesus Christ\\" (based on Acts 2:38) for baptism, and in turn re-baptize converts who were first baptized under the Trinitarian formula, sometimes claiming that such persons would not have been previously aware that \\"Jesus is the Lord\\". Likewise, converts to Trinitarian denominations from Mormonism and other nontrinitarian denominations have to be baptized in the name of the (Nicene) Trinity. Baptism according to the Trinitiarian formula, which is done in most mainstream Christianity, is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians belonging to different Christian denominations. Other uses Together with baptism, the Trinitarian formula is used in other prayers, rites, liturgies, and sacraments. One of its most common uses apart from baptism is when Roman Catholics, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, and others make the sign of the cross while reciting the formula. Views of textual critics Scholars have challenged the work of the Jesus Seminar, who state the verse is an extrapolation, arguing that those working on the project began with a conclusion and worked to justify it through their research and eisegesis.They apply the Seminar's presuppositional test, \\"Beware of finding a Jesus entirely congenial to you\\", especially to the Jesus Seminar themselves, \\"who a priori have determined the nature of the 'historical Jesus' by adopting biased presuppositions, thereby producing a 'Jesus' wholly 'congenial' to themselves\\" (The Jesus Crisis: The Inroads of Historical Criticism Into Evangelical ..., by Robert L. Thomas, F. David Farnell); cf.

Rites in this sense fall into three major categories: * rites of passage, generally changing an individual's social status, such as marriage, adoption, baptism, coming of age, graduation, or inauguration; * communal rites, whether of worship, where a community comes together to worship, such as Jewish synagogue or Mass, or of another character, such as fertility rites and certain non-religious festivals; * rites of personal devotion, where an individual worships, including prayer and pilgrimages, pledges of allegiance, or promises to wed someone. Christianity =Catholicism and Orthodoxy= Within the Catholic Church, \\"rite\\" often refers to what is also called a sacrament and respective liturgies based on liturgical languages and traditional local customs as well as the ceremonies associated with the sacraments. In Christian Catholicism, for example, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick/Last Rites is one of the sacramental rites because they are administered to someone who is or was dying. The other are Penance and Eucharist (administered as Viaticum in the case of a dying person). Since the Second Vatican Council, anointing of the sick is administered to those who are seriously ill but not necessarily in immediate danger of death. Another example is the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults.What Are the Last Rites? The term \\"rite\\" became widely used after the Second Vatican Council. While \\"rite\\" is often associated when receiving a \\"sacrament,\\" it is technically incorrect to say that one received a \\"rite\\" because the sacrament is what is received while a rite is performed. The ritual consists of the prayers and actions that the minister of the sacrament performs when administering a sacrament. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that one has received \\"the last rites\\" as that person has really received \\"the last sacraments\\" by a minister following a ritual that has performed the \\"sacramental rite.\\" Within both Catholicism and Orthodoxy, the term \\"rite\\" also refers to a body of liturgical tradition usually emanating from a specific center. Examples include the Roman Rite, the Byzantine Rite, and the Sarum Rite. Such rites may include various sub-rites. For example, the Byzantine Rite has Greek, Russian, and other ethnically-based variants. In addition, the same term is applied to an autonomous particular Church within the Catholic Church associated with a particular liturgical tradition. Of these, the largest is the Latin Rite or Western Church. There are also several Eastern Catholic Churches which are the same catholic Church with distinct rites. =Protestantism= This Lutheran pastor administers the rite of confirmation on youth confirmands after instructing them in Luther's Small Catechism. Within many Protestant Christian denominations, the word rite is often used specifically for important ceremonies that are not considered sacraments or ordinances. The 39 Articles of the Anglican Communion and the Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church state \\"there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord\\".Thirty-Nine Articles, Article XXVArticles of Religion (Methodist), Article XVI As such, in the Anglican and Methodist traditions, the following are considered rites: \\"confirmation, reconciliation (confessions of sins), matrimony, holy orders and anointing of the sick\\". Similarly the \\"rites of the Moravian Church are Confirmation, Marriage, and Ordination\\". In the Lutheran tradition, Holy Baptism, Holy Eucharist, and Confession & Absolution are considered Lutheran sacraments, while Confirmation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Matrimony, and Holy Orders are rites.

He was king and chief of the O'Donnell dynasty based in Tyrconnell in western Ulster. He is best known for his conflict with Shane O'Neill - a dispute that involved the intervention of the English government in Ireland on Calvagh's side. Life In the course of a quarrel with his father and his half-brother Hugh, Calvagh sought aid in Scotland from the Campbells, who with access to Scottish royal artillery were able to assist him in deposing Manus and securing the now very divided lordship of Tyrconnell for himself. Hugh then appealed to Shane O'Neill, chief of the neighbouring O'Neill dynasty, to restore him at Calvagh's expense. Shane accordingly invaded Tyrconnell at the head of a large army in 1557, desiring to make himself supreme throughout Ulster, and encamped on the shore of Lough Swilly. Calvagh, acting apparently on the advice of his father, who was his prisoner and who remembered the successful night attack on Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone at Knockavoe in 1522, surprised the O'Neills in their camp at night and routed them with the loss of all their spoils. Calvagh had at least two marriages, both reflecting his family's alliance with the Earls of Argyll. By 1555,The earliest definite reference to Calvagh's marriage to a daughter of Argyll occurs in correspondence between the Scottish and English governments relating to the Master of Argyll's 1555 expedition to Tyrconnell. \\"Mercenaries and Paid Men: the Mercenary Identity in the Middle Ages\\", by John France, published 2008.

However, voluminous correspondence of the English government beginning in 1561 makes it clear that Calvagh had married the 4th Earl's widow herself, consistently describing her from that year as the Countess or former Countess of Argyll. \\"Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth\\", originally published 1860, Vol. 1, page 591.

Killydonnell Friary at the western shore of Lough Swilly where Calvagh and his wife were captured in 1561 by Shane O'Neill Calvagh was then recognized by the English government as lord of Tyrconnell; but in 1561 he and his wife were kidnapped by Shane O'Neill in the Franciscan friary of Killydonnell. His wife had previously been the wife of the Earl of Argyll, was kept by Shane O'Neill as his mistress and bore him several children, sources differ as to the level of ill-treatment she endured by her captor; as she divorced Calvagh and married Shane immediately upon their release. Calvagh himself was subjected to atrocious torture during the three years that he remained O'Neill's prisoner, complete with being held in a metal cage at the front of O'Neill's castle in Dungannon, Tyrone. He was released in 1564 on conditions which he had no intention of fulfilling; and crossing to England he threw himself on the mercy of Queen Elizabeth. In 1566 Sir Henry Sidney by the queen's orders marched to Tyrconnell and restored Calvagh to his rights. Calvagh, however, died in the same year, and as his son Conn was a prisoner in the hands of Shane O'Neill, his half-brother Hugh MacManus was inaugurated The O'Donnell in his place. Hugh, who in the family feud with Calvagh had allied himself with O'Neill, now turned round and combined with the English to crush the hereditary enemy of his family; and in 1567 he utterly routed Shane at the battle of Farsetmore near Letterkenny with the loss of 1300 men, compelling him to seek refuge with the MacDonnells of Antrim, by whom he was treacherously put to death. Descendants In 1592 Hugh abdicated in favour of his son Hugh Roe O'Donnell; but there was a member of the elder branch of the family who resented the passing of the chieftainship to the descendants of Manus O'Donnell's second marriage. This was Niall Garve, second son of Calvagh's son Conn. His elder brother was Hugh of Ramelton, whose son John, an officer in the Spanish army, was father of Hugh Baldearg O'Donnell (d. 1704), known in Spain as Count O'Donnell, who commanded an Irish regiment as brigadier in the Spanish service. This officer came to Ireland in 1690 and raised an army in Ulster for the service of James II in the Williamite war in Ireland, afterwards deserting to the side of William III, from whom he accepted a pension.

Niall Garbh was incensed at the elevation of his cousin Hugh Roe (Red Hugh) to the chieftainship in 1592, was further alienated when the latter deprived him of his castle of Lifford, and a bitter feud between the two O'Donnells was the result. While Red Hugh O'Donnell was engaged in the Nine Years' War against the English, Niall Garve exploited the political situation to his own advantage. Niall Garve made terms with the English government, to whom he rendered valuable service both against the O'Neills and against his cousin, enabling an English force to land at Derry under Sir Henry Docwra: Docwra for a time regarded Niall as an invaluable ally. But in 1601 he quarrelled with the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who, though willing to establish Niall Garve in the lordship of Tyrconnell, would not permit him to enforce his supremacy over Sir Cahir O'Doherty in Inishowen. Nonetheless the same year he led an Anglo-Irish force that captured Donegal. It was then laid siege to by the rebels, but Niall Garve oversaw a successful defence. After the departure of Hugh Roe from Ireland in 1602, Niall Garve tried to seize the chieftainship, and was \\"inaugurated\\" as the 25th O'Donnell in 1603, but without the full required support of the derbfine (electoral kinship group). This was repudiated by Hugh Roe's surviving family, and especially by his younger brother Rory. To find a solution, Niall Garve, and Hugh Roe's brother Rory went to London in 1603, where the privy council endeavoured to arrange the family quarrel. As a result, King James I of England granted some lands to Niall Garve, but raised Rory to the peerage as Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell,Letters patent of 4 September 1603, invested in Dublin on 29 September 1603 and also granted him the territorial Lordship of Tyrconnell. Niall Garve was later accused of turning against the Crown. When Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched an uprising by burning Derry in 1608, Niall Garve was charged with complicity in the ensuing O'Doherty's Rebellion. He and his son Neachtain were sent to the Tower of London, where they remained until their deaths. Family Niall Garve had married his cousin Nuala, sister of Hugh Roe and Rory O'Donnell. When Rory fled with Hugh O'Neill the Earl of Tyrone to Rome in 1607 (see the Flight of the Earls), Nuala, who had left her husband when he joined the English against her brother, accompanied him, taking with her her daughter, Grania. She was the subject of an Irish poem, of which an English version was written by James Mangan from a prose translation by Eugene O'Curry. :A bhean fuair faill ar an bhfeart :Thruaigh liom a bhfaghthaoi d'√©isdeacht :D√° mbeath fian Gaoidheal ad ghar :Do bhiadh gud chaoineadh cognamh‚Ä¶ :'O woman that hast found the tomb unguarded, :pitiful to me the number thou findest to listen; :were the soldiery of the Gaels at thy side there would be help with thy keening.The Field Day of Irish Writing, Volume 4 External links * Gaelic Book Collections, nls.uk; accessed 5 October 2015.

He is considered a member of the late 19th-/early 20th- century modernist movement Young Poland and widely viewed as one of the greatest Polish composers. The early works show the influence of the late Romantic German school as well as the early works of Alexander Scriabin, as exemplified by his √âtude Op. 4 No. 3 and his first two symphonies. Later, he developed an impressionistic and partially atonal style, represented by such works as the Third Symphony and his Violin Concerto No. 1. His third period was influenced by the folk music of the Polish G√≥rale people, including the ballet Harnasie, the Fourth Symphony, and his sets of Mazurkas for piano. Kr√≥l Roger composed between 1918 and 1924, remains the most popular opera by Szymanowski. His other significant works include opera Hagith, Symphony No. 2, The Love Songs of Hafiz, and Stabat Mater. He was awarded the highest national honors, including the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland and other distinctions, both Polish and foreign. Life Nowy ≈öwiat 47 street, Warsaw, where Szymanowski lived and composed in 1924‚Äì29 Szymanowski was born into the Korwin-Szymanowski family, members of the wealthy land-owning Polish gentry class, in the village of Tymosz√≥wka, then in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Tymoshivka in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine). He studied music privately with his father before enrolling at the Gustav Neuhaus Elisavetgrad School of Music in 1892. From 1901 he attended the State Conservatory in Warsaw, of which he was later director from 1926 until retiring in 1930. Since musical opportunities in Congress Poland were quite limited, he travelled throughout Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the United States. In Berlin he founded the Young Polish Composers‚Äô Publishing Company (1905‚Äì12) whose primary aim was to publish new works by his countrymen. During his stay in Vienna (1911-1914) he wrote the opera Hagith and composed two song cycles called The Love Songs of Hafiz, which represent a transition between the first and second periods of the composer's style. Being lame in one knee made him unsuitable for military service in World War I, and consequently, between 1914 and 1917, he composed many works and devoted himself to studying Islamic culture, ancient Greek drama as well as philosophy. During this period, his works such as Mity (1914; ‚ÄúMyths‚Äù), Metopy (1915; M√©topes), and Maski (1916; ‚ÄúMasques‚Äù), are characterized by great originality and diversity of style. The dynamic extremes in Szymanowski's music became softened, and the composer started employing coloristic orchestration and using polytonal and atonal material while preserving the expressive melodic style of his previous works. In 1918, Szymanowski completed the manuscript of a two-volume novel, Efebos, which took homosexuality as its subject.Stephen Downes, \\"Eros and Paneuropeanism\\", in Harry White and Michael Murphy, eds., Musical Constructions of Nationalism: Essays on the History and Ideology of European Musical Cultute, 1800-1945 (Cork University Press, 2001), 51-71, esp. 52, 66-7The manuscript was lost in a fire in September 1939 during the siege of Warsaw. The only part that survives is the central chapter, \\"The Symposium\\", which Szymanowski translated into Russian and gave as a gift to Boris Kochno, who became his love interest when they met in the spring of 1919. Szymanowski wrote that his novel depicts \\"the history of a gradual liberation from various types of traditional, inherited slavery by an increasingly clear mirage of true freedom of the soul\\". His travels, especially those to the Mediterranean area, provided him with new experience, both personal and artistic. Arthur Rubinstein found Szymanowski different when they met in Paris in 1921: \\"Karol had changed; I had already begun to be aware of it before the war when a wealthy friend and admirer of his invited him twice to visit Sicily. After his return he raved about Sicily, especially Taormina. 'There,' he said, 'I saw a few young men bathing who could be models for Antinous. I couldn't take my eyes off them.' Now he was a confirmed homosexual. He told me all this with burning eyes.\\"Arthur Rubinstein, My Many Years (London, 1980), 103 Of his works created or first imagined, such as Kr√≥l Roger, during the years 1917 to 1921, both musical and literary, one critic has written: \\"we have a body of work representing a dazzling personal synthesis of cultural references, crossing the boundaries of nation, race and gender to form an affirmative belief in an international society of the future based on the artistic freedom granted by Eros.\\" Szymanowski settled in Warsaw in 1919. In 1926 he accepted the position of Director of the Warsaw Conservatory though he had little administrative experience. He became seriously ill in 1928 and temporarily lost his post. He was diagnosed with an acute form of tuberculosis, and in 1929 traveled to Davos, Switzerland, for medical treatment. Szymanowski resumed his position at the Conservatory in 1930, but the school was closed two years later by a ministerial decision. He moved to Villa Atma in Zakopane where he composed fervently. While living in Zakopane, Szymanowski developed a keen interest in the Polish folk idiom and undertook the task of creating a Polish national style, an endeavour not attempted since the times of Chopin. He immersed himself in the culture of the Polish Highlanders (Gorals) and embraced their tonal language, syncopated rhythms, and winding melodies into the new style of his music. In 1936 Szymanowski received more treatment at a sanatorium in Grasse, but it was no longer effective. He died at a sanatorium in Lausanne on 29 March 1937. His body was brought back to Poland by his sister Stanis≈Çawa and laid to rest at Ska≈Çka in Krak√≥w, the \\"national Panth√©on\\" for the most distinguished Poles. Szymanowski's long correspondence with the pianist Jan Smeterlin, who was a significant champion of his piano works, was published in 1969.Boguslaw Maciejewski and Felix Aprahamian, eds., Karol Szymanowski and Jan Smeterlin: Correspondence and Essays. Allegro Press, 1969 Influences Szymanowski was influenced by the music of Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, Max Reger, Alexander Scriabin and the impressionism of Claude Debussy, and Maurice Ravel. He also drew much influence from his countryman Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and from Polish folk music. Like Chopin he wrote a number of mazurkas for piano. He was specifically influenced by the folk music of the Polish Highlanders, which he discovered in Zakopane in the southern Tatra highlands. He wrote in an article entitled \\"About Goral Music\\" : \\"My discovery of the essential beauty of Goral music, dance and architecture is a very personal one; much of this beauty I have absorbed into my innermost soul\\" (p. 97). According to Jim Samson (1977, p. 200), it is \\"played on two fiddles and a string bass\\", and, \\"has uniquely 'exotic' characteristics, highly dissonant and with fascinating heterophonic effects\\". Carefully digesting all these elements, eventually Szymanowski developed a highly individual rhapsodic style and a harmonic world of his own. Aleksander Laskowski describes the composer's music and its changing style in the following words: ‚ÄúHe invented a musical language [...] His works were true and ingenious creations. And his oeuvre shows an incredible development from the Straussian and Wagnerian, through an interesting and very romantic Oriental period, and finishing with a national period influenced by his time in the Tatras.‚Äù Works Villa Atma, Szymanowski's house in Zakopane, now the Karol Szymanowski Museum Among Szymanowski's better known orchestral works are four symphonies (including No. 3, Song of the Night with choir and vocal soloists, and No. 4, Symphonie Concertante, with piano concertante) and two violin concertos. His stage works include the ballets Harnasie and Mandragora and the operas Hagith and King Roger. He wrote much piano music, including the four √âtudes, Op. 4 (of which No. 3 was once his single most popular piece), many mazurkas and M√©topes. Other works include the Three Myths for violin and piano, Nocturne and Tarantella, two string quartets, a sonata for violin and piano, a number of orchestral songs (some to texts by Hafiz and James Joyce) and his Stabat Mater. According to Samson (p. 131), \\"Szymanowski adopted no thorough-going alternatives to tonal organization [...] the harmonic tensions and relaxations and the melodic phraseology have clear origins in tonal procedure, but [...] an underpinning tonal framework has been almost or completely dissolved away.\\" Szymanowski's music has received international recognition. In the 1920s and the 1930s, his music proved immensely popular. The composer's works were performed throughout the world by celebrated soloists such as Artur Rubinstein, Harry Neuhaus, Robert Casadesus, Pawe≈Ç Kocha≈Ñski, Bronis≈Çaw Huberman, Joseph Szigeti, and Jacques Thibaud and by orchestras led by famous conductors including Emil M≈Çynarski, Albert Coates, Pierre Monteux, Philippe Gaubert, Leopold Stokowski, Willem Mengelberg. European and American performances of his Stabat Mater were world-scale events, progressing successfully in Naples, Paris, Liege, New York, Chicago and Worcester. A performance of King Roger in Prague on 21 October 1932 directed by Josef Munclingr closely reflected the composer‚Äôs own idea of the piece, and turned out a huge success, just as the stage production of Harnasie. A Polish recording of his Symphony No. 4 (‚ÄúSymphonie Concertante‚Äù) in 1932 was followed by a series of performances abroad, mostly with Szymanowski at the piano and conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg. In 1933, the symphony was performed in London, Bologna, Cleveland; Moscow, Zagreb, Bucharest; in 1934 ‚Äì in Paris, Sofia, London; in 1935 ‚Äì in Stockholm, Oslo, Bergen, Berlin, Rome, Liege and Maastricht; in 1937 ‚Äì in the Hague. In 1994, a renowned director Charles Dutoit recorded both of his Violin Concertos with Montreal Symphony Orchestra. English conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, called him ‚Äúone of the greatest composers of this [20th] century‚Äù and produced a series of important recordings with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. In 2004, Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti won the BBC Young Musician of the Year with a performance of Szymanowski‚Äôs Violin Concerto No. 1. In 2008 his opera King Roger, which is regarded as his masterpiece, was performed at Edinburgh International Festival under the baton of Valery Gergiev and his renowned Mariinsky opera company. In 2012 Gergiev led the London Symphony Orchestra's performance of all four of the composer‚Äôs symphonies at the Edinburgh International Festival. In 2015 opera King Roger was staged in London's Royal Opera House and was produced by Kasper Holten. In the past two decades, his music has enjoyed a great revival and has been performed around the world. It has been recorded by many prominent conductors and musicians such as Pierre Boulez, Edward Gardner, Vladimir Jurowski, Mark Elder and Krystian Zimerman.  Recognition  Karol Szymanowski received numerous important awards, which include: The Officer Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta; The Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy; The Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy; the Knight of Legion d'Honneur; an honorary plaque at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia; The Commander Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta; The Academic Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature, Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. He was also a Doctor Honoris Causa of the Jagiellonian University, Krak√≥w and an honorary member of the Czech Academy of Learning, the Latvian Conservatory of Music in Riga, the St Cecilia Royal Academy in Rome, the Royal Academy of Music in Belgrade, and the International Society for Contemporary Music. On 16 November 2006, the Polish Parliament passed a resolution to name 2007 \\"The Year of Karol Szymanowski\\" in order to honour the 125th anniversary of the composer's birth and the 70th anniversary of his death. On 3 October 2007, the National Bank of Poland issued special commemorative coins depicting the composer in the following denominations: 200 zloty, 10 zloty and 2 zloty. The Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music in Katowice as well as the Krak√≥w Philharmonic have been both named in remembrance of the composer. On 11 November 2018, to commemorate 100th anniversary of the regaining of Polish independence, President Andrzej Duda posthumously awarded Szymanowski as well as 24 other distinguished Poles, Poland's highest decoration the Order of the White Eagle.

He was an important member of the O'Donnell dynasty based in County Donegal in Ulster. Early life Hugh Dubh (pronounced in Ulster Irish as 'Hugh Doo') had been R√≠ (king) of the O'Donnells during one of the bitterest and most protracted of the feuds between his clan and the O'Neills, which in 1491 led to a war lasting more than ten years. He left his son to rule Tyrconnell, though still a boy, when he went on a pilgrimage to Rome about 1511. On his return from Rome (via England, where he was knighted by King Henry VIIIJonathan Bardon, A Narrow Sea: The Irish-Scottish Connection in 120 Episodes, p. 60. Gill, Dublin, 2018) in broken health after two years' absence, his son Manus, who had proved himself a capable leader in defending his country against the O'Neills, retained the chief authority. When Sir Hugh Dubh O'Donnell, as he was now, appealed for aid against his son to the Maguires, Manus made an alliance with the O'Neills, by whose assistance he established his hold over Tyrconnell. But in 1522 the two great northern clans were again at war. Conn O'Neill, An √ì N√©ill (who was created The 1st Earl of Tyrone in 1542), was determined to bring the O'Donnells under his rule. Supported by Munster and Connacht, and assisted also by English contingents and by the MacDonnells of Antrim, O'Neill took the castle of Ballyshannon, and after devastating a large part of Tyrconnell he encamped at Knockavoe, near Strabane. Here he was surprised at night by Sir Hugh Dubh and Manus O'Donnell, and routed with the loss of 900 men and an immense quantity of booty in the Battle of Knockavoe. Although this was one of the bloodiest ever battles between the O'Neills and the O'Donnells, it did not end the war; and in 1531 O'Donnell applied to the Lordship of Ireland for protection, giving assurances of allegiance to King Henry VIII. Geraldine League In February 1537, The 10th Earl of Kildare (previously known as Lord Offaly, and better known to history as 'Silken Thomas') and his five uncles were executed at Tyburn for their rebellion in Leinster. Following their executions, the English Crown made every effort to capture Gerald, 11th Earl of Kildare, the new head of the FitzGerald dynasty and the new claimant to the Earldom of Kildare, a boy of twelve who was in the secret custody of his aunt, Lady Eleanor McCarthy. Lady Eleanor, in order to secure a powerful protector for the boy, accepted an offer of marriage from Manus O'Donnell, who on the death of Sir Hugh Dubh in July 1537 was inaugurated as \\"The O'Donnell\\". Conn O'Neill (later Earl of Tyrone) was a relative of the young Lord Kildare, and this event accordingly led to the formation of the short-lived Geraldine League, a federation including the O'Neills, the O'Donnells, the O'Briens of Thomond, and other powerful clans; the primary object of which was to restore young Lord Kildare to his lands, titles and properties, but which afterwards aimed at the complete overthrow of English rule in Ireland. Chief of the O'Donnells In August 1539, O'Donnell and Conn O'Neill were heavily defeated by the Lord Deputy at Lake Bellahoe, in County Monaghan, which crippled their power for many years. In the west Manus made unceasing efforts to assert the supremacy of the O'Donnells in north Connacht, where he compelled O'Conor Sligo to acknowledge his over-lordship in 1539. In 1542 he went to England and presented himself, together with Conn O'Neill and other Irish chiefs, became a Protestant, and recognising Henry VIII, who promised to make him Earl of Tyrconnell, though he refused O'Donnell's request to be made Earl of Sligo. The assimilation process was known as \\"surrender and regrant\\". In his later years Manus was troubled by quarrels between his sons Calvagh and Hugh MacManus; in 1555 he was imprisoned by Calvagh, who deposed him from all authority in Tyrconnell, and he died in 1564. Manus O'Donnell, though a fierce warrior, was hospitable and generous to the poor and the Church. He is described by the Four Masters as \\"a learned man, skilled in many arts, gifted with a profound intellect, and the knowledge of every science.\\" At his castle of Portnatrynod near Strabane he supervised, if he did not actually dictate, the writing of the Life of Saint Columbkille in Irish, which is preserved in the Bodleian Library (Rawlinson B 514) at Oxford. He was also a poet and many of his poems, written in Irish, survive. Manus was married several times. His first wife, Joan O'Reilly, was the mother of Calvagh, and two daughters, both of whom married O'Neills; the younger, Margaret, was wife of the famous rebel Shane O'Neill. His second wife, Hugh's mother, by whom he was ancestor of the Earls of Tyrconnell (see below), was Judith, sister of Conn Bacach O'Neill, 1st earl of Tyrone, and aunt of Shane. References *Rev.

As a scholar he was influential in the development of medieval history as an academic subject. Life Dugdale was born at Shustoke, near Coleshill in Warwickshire, where his father, John Dugdale, was steward to the local landowner. As he was born, a swarm of bees flew into the garden, which some considered \\"a happy presage on the life of the babe.\\" He was educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. In 1623 he married Margaret Huntbach (1607‚Äì81), with whom he had nineteen children. In 1625, the year after his father's death, he purchased the manor of Blyth, near Shustoke. During an enclosure dispute with a neighbour a few years later he met the Leicestershire antiquary William Burton, who acted as arbitrator. He became involved in transcribing documents and collecting church notes and met other Midlands antiquaries such as Sir Symon Archer (1581‚Äì1662) and Sir Thomas Habington. He began working with Archer on the history of Warwickshire and their research led them to the archives of public records in London. There he met Sir Christopher Hatton, Sir Henry Spelman, Sir Simonds d'Ewes and Sir Edward Dering. Hatton provided him with hospitality in Holborn and became his principal patron. In 1638 through the influence of his friends Dugdale was created a pursuivant of arms extraordinary by the name of Blanch Lyon, and in 1639 he was promoted to the office of Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. The accommodation in the College of Arms and the income from his post enabled him to pursue his research in London. According to his later account, in 1641 Sir Christopher Hatton, foreseeing the war and dreading the ruin and spoliation of the Church, commissioned him to make exact drafts of all the monuments in Westminster Abbey and the principal churches in England. Portrait of Sir William Dugdale by Silvester Harding In June 1642 he was summoned with the other heralds to attend the king at York. When war broke out Charles deputed him to summon the castles of Banbury and Warwick to surrender. He witnessed the battle of Edgehill, and later returned with a surveyor to make a survey of the battlefield. He arrived in Oxford with the king in November 1642 and he was admitted MA of the University. He worked as a bureaucrat in the royalist capital, especially after December 1643 when Hatton was appointed Comptroller of the Household. In 1644 the king appointed him Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary. During his leisure at Oxford he collected material at the Bodleian Library and college libraries for his books. It was during these years that he met Elias Ashmole, who later became his son-in-law. Following the surrender of Oxford in 1646 Dugdale returned to Blyth Hall and compounded for his estates under the terms of the Oxford articles. Hatton, who had opposed the surrender, went into exile in France, where Dugdale visited him in 1648. He recommenced his antiquarian researches, collaborating with Roger Dodsworth on the Monasticon Anglicanum, the first volume of which was published in 1655. In the following year he published his own Antiquities of Warwickshire, which was soon recognised as a model county history. In this work he was one of the first to consider the significance of stone tools, stating these were \\"weapons used by the Britons before the art of making arms of brass or iron was known\\". At the Restoration Dugdale obtained the office of Norroy King of Arms through the influence of the Earl of Clarendon. In the office of Norroy he undertook heraldic visitations of the counties north of the Trent. In 1677 he was knighted and promoted to the office of Garter Principal King of Arms, which he held until his death. In his last years he wrote an account of his life at the request of Anthony Wood. He died \\"in his chair\\" at Blythe Hall in 1686.

Born to a family of fishermen in 1953, she was the third child of Sugunanandan and Damayanti. She has six siblings. As part of her chores, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ gathered food scraps from neighbours for her family's cows and goats, through which she was confronted with the intense poverty and suffering of others. She would bring these people food and clothing from her own home. Her family, which was not wealthy, scolded and punished her. Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ also began to spontaneously embrace people to comfort them in their sorrow. Despite the reaction of her parents, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ continued.Amritanandamayichi ‚Äì A Biography of Mata Amritanandamayi by Swami Amritaswarupananda, Regarding her desire to embrace others, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ commented, \\"I don't see if it is a man or a woman. I don't see anyone different from my own self. A continuous stream of love flows from me to all of creation. This is my inborn nature. The duty of a doctor is to treat patients. In the same way, my duty is to console those who are suffering.\\" Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ rejected numerous attempts by her parents to arrange for her marriage.Millions flock to India's hugging guru.

In 1981, after spiritual seekers had begun residing at her parents' property in Parayakadavu in the hopes of becoming Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s disciples, the MƒÅtƒÅ Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ Math (MAM), a worldwide foundation, was founded.On 6 May 1981, \\"with a view to preserving and propagating the ideals and teachings of the Holy Mother, the MƒÅtƒÅ Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ Math and Mission Trust was founded and registered under the Travancore-Cochin State Literary and Charitable Act of 1955, at Kollam, Kerala, South India.\\" Amritanandamayichi ‚Äì A Biography of Mata Amritanandamayi by Swami Amritaswarupananda, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ continues to serve as chairperson of the Math.

In 1987, at the request of devotees, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ began to conduct programs in countries throughout the world. She continues to do so annually. Darshan Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s form of giving darshana is hugging people. As to how this began, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ said, \\"People used to come and tell [me] their troubles. They would cry and I would wipe their tears. When they fell weeping into my lap, I used to hug them. Then the next person too wanted it...

Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ has embraced more than 33 million people throughout the world for over 30 years. When asked, in 2002, to what extent she thought her embraces helped the ills of the world, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ replied, \\"I don't say I can do it 100 percent. Attempting to change the world [completely] is like trying to straighten the curly tail of a dog. But society takes birth from people. So by affecting individuals, you can make changes in the society and, through it, in the world. You cannot change it, but you can make changes. The fight in individual minds is responsible for the wars. So if you can touch people, you can touch the world.\\" Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s darshana has been the centerpiece of her life, as she has received people nearly every day since the late 1970s. Given the size of the crowds coming to seek Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s blessings, there have been times when she has given darshana for more than 20 continuous hours. Teachings and public image Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma) embraces a child. In the book The Timeless Path, Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, one of Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s senior disciples, wrote: \\"The [spiritual] path inculcated by Amma is the same as the one presented in the Vedas and recapitulated in subsequent traditional scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita.\\"The Timeless Path by Swami Ramakrishnananda, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ herself says, \\"karma [action], j√±ana [knowledge] and bhakti [devotion] are all essential. If the two wings of a bird are devotion and action, knowledge is its tail. Only with the help of all three can the bird soar into the heights.\\"Lead Us to the Light: A Collection of Mata Amritanandamayi's Teachings Compiled by Swami Jnanamritananda She accepts the various spiritual practices and prayers of all religions as but different methods toward the same goal of purifying the mind.\\"The goal of all religions is one‚Äîpurification of the human mind.\\" (\\"Living in Harmony\\" By Mata Amritanandamayi) Along these lines, she stresses the importance of meditation, performing actions as karma yoga, selfless service, and cultivating divine qualities such as compassion, patience, forgiveness, self-control, etc. Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ has said that these practices refine the mind, preparing it to assimilate the ultimate truth: that one is not the physical body and mind, but the eternal, blissful consciousness that serves as the non-dual substratum of the universe. This understanding itself Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ referred to as jivanmukti [liberation while alive]. Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ said, \\"Jivanmukti is not something to be attained after death, nor is it to be experienced or bestowed upon you in another world. It is a state of perfect awareness and equanimity, which can be experienced here and now in this world, while living in the body. Having come to experience the highest truth of oneness with the Self, such blessed souls do not have to be born again. They merge with the infinite.\\" Amritanandamayi is known for frequently referring to herself in the third person as \\"Amma\\", which is a common spiritual practice in Hinduism. Social Issues In her public talks and in articles, Amritanandamayi has taken up several social issues, including the importance of selfless service, the need for inter-religious harmony, for environmental protection and of desegregating science and spirituality. She also regularly speaks on the importance of women's empowerment and gender equality as well as that of humankind cultivating what she refers to as vi≈õva- mƒÅtrutvam ‚Äî an attitude of motherliness towards all beings in creation, specifically through expressing compassion, patience and selflessness. She has also spoken out against human trafficking and forced prostitution, speaking at the Vatican and signing the Universal Declaration Against Slavery in an event organized by Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2014. And in 2018, under the patronage of Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, she participated in a similar event aimed at protecting children from abuse and predation via the Internet. In July 2015, Amritanandamayi delivered the keynote address at a United Nations Academic Impact conference on technology and sustainable development, co-hosted by Amrita University. There, she requested the scientific community to infuse its research with awareness and compassion, stressing the importance of keeping the aim of uplifting the poor and suffering in mind when undertaking technological research. She has spoken several times at the United Nations and twice at the Parliament of the World's Religions. Bhajans Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ has recorded more than 1,000 bhajans, or devotional songs, in 35 languages.McGregor, Gretchen Kusuma, \\"In the Shelter of Her Arms,\\" 2012, MA Center, page 199. \\"It's hard to imagine, but now, in 2012, Amma has recorded well over 1,000 songs in 35 languages.\\" She has also composed dozens of bhajans and set them to traditional ragas. Regarding devotional singing as a spiritual practice, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ says, \\"If the bhajan is sung with one-pointedness, it is beneficial for the singer, the listeners, and Nature as well. Later when the listeners reflect on the songs, they will try to live in accordance with the lessons enunciated therein.\\"Awaken, Children, Volume 2: Dialogues with Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ has said that in today's world, it is often difficult for people to attain deeply focused concentration in meditation. A person can be aided in reaching this level of concentration with bhajans.For My Children: The Teachings of Her Holiness, Sri Mata Amritanandmayai Devi, page 70 Humanitarian Work Amritanandamayi is founder and chairman of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math and the founder of Embracing the World. Embracing the World is a global network of local and regional charitable organizations and projects that has grown out of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math's India-based charitable projects. The organizations' focus is on providing the poor with the five basic needs of food, shelter, healthcare, education and livelihood. The organizations also conduct work in the fields of disaster relief and environmental protection as well as on conducting research and developing new technologies to help the poor and needy. =Food= In India, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math provides 10 million free meals to poor people annually via its various centres. Likewise, Embracing the World feed more than 150,000 annually in North America through 49 centres that conduct a program called \\"Mother‚Äôs Kitchen,\\" started in 1987. Other feed-the-hungry programs exist in Mexico, Costa Rica, France, Spain, Kenya, Brazil, Slovenia and Australia. The Math is also currently deploying filtration systems with the goal of providing clean drinking water in 5,000 village centres throughout India, which would provide water purification to 10 million villagers. =Shelter= Since 1998, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has constructed over 47,000 houses for the homeless in 75 locations throughout India. It also runs an orphanage for 500 children in Kerala, and Embracing the World manages a children‚Äôs home in Nairobi. =Healthcare= The Mata Amritanandamayi Math manages the 1,100-bed super-speciality hospital Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi, which it launched in 1998, as well as several other free healthcare clinics, medicine dispensaries, hospices in India. It is also in the process of constructing a 2,000-bed hospital in Delhi NCR. In total, the math has provided totally free medical care and surgeries to more than four million people since 1998. This includes super-specialty surgeries including heart surgeries, brain surgeries and kidney transplants. Aside from free treatment, Amrita Institute provides care on a sliding scale, allowing people to pay what they can afford. This is often a minimal percent of the total medical cost. =Livelihood= In 1998, the Math started a program titled Amrita Nidhi that provides lifetime pensions to destitute widows and to people who are physically and mentally challenged. As of 2019, a total of 100,000 people were enrolled. It also started AmritaSREE (Self-Reliance, Empowerment & Employment) in 2006. This program has helped more than 200,000 women form Self-Help Groups throughout India. =Education= Amritanandamayi is founder and chancellor of Amrita University, a six-campus, multi-disciplinary research university that in 2020 was ranked as the fourth-best university in India by NIRF, is accredited with an 'A' grade by NAAC, and was selected as an \\"Institute of Eminence\\" by the Indian Government in 2019. Under Amritanandamayi's guidance, the university puts a strong focus on research-and-development to uplift the sick and poor. The Mata Amritanandamayi Math also runs a scholarship program that currently provides 50,000 scholarships for economically challenged children throughout India, and Embracing the World provides scholarships outside of India in times of need, such as in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. =Disaster Relief= Within India, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has been involved in relief-and-rehabilitation efforts following natural disasters since 2001, and Embracing the World has come to aid in the wake of several disasters outside of India as well. Embracing the World has provided a total of $75 million in disaster-relief work since 2004. The disasters after which the Mata Amritanandamayi Math and Embracing the world have conducted relief-and-rehabilitation work include: the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Hurricane Katrina (2005), the 2008 Bihar flood, the 2005 Gujarat flood, the Maharashtra floods of 2005, Cyclone Aila of 2009, the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2013 North India floods, Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the 2014 India‚ÄìPakistan floods, the May 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2015 South Indian floods, the Puttingal temple fire of 2016, Hurricane Maria of 2017, Cyclone Ockhi of 2017, the 2018 Kerala floods, and the 2019 Kerala floods. In 2019, the Math gave Rs. 500,000 to each of the families of the 40 CRPF soldiers who were killed in the 2019 Pulwama attack. =Environmental Protection= On 11 September 2015, Amritanandamayi donated US$15 million to the Government of India's Namami Gange \\"Clean the Ganges\\" program for the specific purpose of constructing toilets for poor families living along the Ganges River. On 27 September 2015, Amritanandamayi pledged that her NGO would dedicate the value of another US$15 million to toilet construction and other sanitation efforts specifically in the Indian state of Kerala. Amritanandamayi's organization has been cleaning the Pampa River and Sabarimala Kerala Temple pilgrimage site annually since 2012. Controversies =Book by Sreeni Pattathanam= Sreeni Pattathanam, the Kerala-based head of the Indian Rationalist Association, wrote Matha Amritanandamayi: Sacred Stories and Realities, a controversial critique first published in 1985. The author claimed that all the \\"miracles\\" of Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ were falsified. It was further written that there had been many suspicious deaths in and around her ashram that required police investigation.Mass Publicationas, Kollam, Kerala, revised edn. (The Malayalam language subtitle is \\"Divya Kathakalum Yatharthyavum\\".) On 9 August 2002, Deshabhimani, a Malayalam daily newspaper published a similar account, demanding investigation into the same deaths Pattathanam found suspicious.\\"Report that Suspicious Deaths at Amritanandamayi Math Are Growing\\", Deshabhimani, 9 August 2002. On 24 September 2002, Deshabhimani officially apologised for the report, publishing an article titled \\"Report that Suspicious Deaths at Amritanandamayi Math Are Growing Was Incorrect\\". The article stated: \\"We now state with conviction that there was nothing suspicious about deaths that happened in the Math. Some of the deaths mentioned in the article did not even take place at the Math.\\" The article went on to explain that relatives of the deceased had personally contacted Deshabhimani in order to correct the misinformation conveyed in the original article. In several cases, the editors noted the relatives had contacted Deshabhimani to explain they were at the bedsides of elderly kin who had died of natural causes, with no suspicious aspects regarding the passings.\\"Report that Suspicious Deaths at Amritanandamayi Math Are Growing Was Incorrect\\", Deshabhimani, 24 September 2002, p. 6. In 2004, the Kerala State Government sanctioned criminal prosecution of Patthathanam, the owner of the publishing company, and the printer of the book on grounds that religious sentiments had been offended and for the libelous statements in the book. The order followed directions from the Kerala High Court to the Home Department for considering an application by T.K. Ajan, a resident of the Mata Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ Math. CPI leader Thengamam Balakrishnan protested the move against Pattathanam. =Source of foreign aid= In June 2007, Shantanu Guha Ray wrote in Tehelka weekly that Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ Math, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Baba Ramdev, and other NGOs and religious organisations had large annual turnover of INR crores. In June 2007, novelist Paul Zacharia wrote on Tehelka that Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ is free from the typical scrutiny on money that has foreign connections. In May 2008, the president of Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham, U. Kalanathan, urged the state government to conduct an enquiry into Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s assets. He said the sources of her income and its utilisation should be investigated. In June 2008, writer Sukumar Azhikode demanded the state government to probe the source of foreign aid received by her organisation. =Allegations by Gail Tredwell= In 2013, Gail Tredwell, a former disciple of Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´, self- published a memoir of her 1980‚Äì99 tenure in Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´'s ashram. She made some allegations in this memoir as well as media interviews which preceded and followed the release of the book. The allegations, including the claim that Tredwell was physically assaulted by Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´, have not been substantiated. Both Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ and representatives of her ashram denied the allegations, saying that they were untrue and were aimed at exacting revenge for unfulfilled desires. In an interview in April 2014, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ spoke in depth about the incident, saying, \\"Even now, Amma is only filled with love for that daughter. I am praying that virtue and goodness come. Time will shine forth the truth.\\" Attacks In August 2005, Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ was attacked by a man named Pavithran. He was sitting with other followers praying and singing in front of Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´. He then rushed to Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ with a knife, but was overpowered by a group of disciples. Amritanandamayi's disciple Swami Amritaswarupananda Puri said Pavithran was of \\"unstable mind\\". Pavithran was also bruised and taken to a hospital immediately. Amritanandamayi, who forgave Pavithran, said, \\"All those who are born will die one day. I am going ahead keeping this reality in mind. I will carry on. I will continue to give darshan to the devotees coming here to meet me.\\" On 1 August 2012, a 23-year-old law student from Bihar, Satnam Singh Mann, attempted to barge onto the podium of Am·πõtƒÅnandamayƒ´ at her ashram in Kollam. According to police, he was screaming and reciting words in Arabic. He was overpowered by devotees, who handed him over to the police.

Experiences can be accompanied by active awareness on the part of the person having the experience, although they need not be. Compare various contemporary definitions given in the OED (2nd edition, 1989): \\"[...] 3. The actual observation of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...] 4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...] b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...] 6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...] 7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired.\\" Experience is the primary subject of various subfields of philosophy, including the philosophy of perception, the philosophy of mind, and phenomenology. Several different senses of the word \\"experience\\" should be distinguished from one another. In the sense of the word under discussion here, \\"experience\\" means something along the lines of \\"perception\\", \\"sensation\\", or \\"observation\\". In this sense of the word, knowledge gained from experience is called \\"empirical knowledge\\" or \\"a posteriori knowledge\\". This can include propositional knowledge (e.g. finding out that certain things are true based on sensory experience), procedural knowledge (e.g. learning how to perform a particular task based on sensory experience), or knowledge by acquaintance (e.g. familiarity with certain people, places, or objects based on direct exposure to them). In ordinary language, the word \\"experience\\" may instead sometimes refer to one's level of competence or expertise, either in general or confined to a particular subject. In this sense of the word, \\"experience\\" generally refers to know-how rather than propositional knowledge (or in other words, on-the-job training rather than book-learning). This article is not about \\"experience\\" in this sense, but is instead about the immediate perception of events.  Background  The word \\"experience\\" shares a common Latin root with the word \\"experimentation\\".  Perceptual experience  In everyday usage, the word \\"experience\\" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, to both unprocessed, immediately perceived events (such as \\"the experience of looking out the window\\"), and to the purported knowledge gained from these events or from reflection on previous events (i.e. \\"several years of experience working in that discipline\\"). This article is about the former, not the latter. Experience is, first and foremost, sensory, and perceptual experience encompasses much of we call \\"experience\\". Compare: One of the main topics of the philosophy of perception is determining the features which are constitutive of perceptual experience, including the content that our experiences have, the representational or non-representational nature of experience, and the role of consciousness in experience.  Other types of experience  Mental experience involves the aspect of intellect and consciousness experienced as combinations of thought, perception, memory, emotion, will and imagination, including all unconscious cognitive processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience. = Intellectual experience = Mathematicians can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. Mathematical realism, like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include Paul Erd≈ës and Kurt G√∂del. G√∂del believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the continuum hypothesis, might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. G√∂del suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. = Emotional experience = Humans can rationalize falling in (and out of) love as \\"emotional experience\\". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence mate-selection. The concept of emotional experience also appears in the notion of empathy. = Religious experience = Mystics can describe their visions as \\"spiritual experiences\\". However, psychology and neuropsychology may explain the same experiences in terms of altered states of consciousness, which may come about accidentally through (for example) very high fever, infections such as meningitis, sleep deprivation, fasting, oxygen deprivation, nitrogen narcosis (deep diving), psychosis, temporal-lobe epilepsy, or a traumatic accident. People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized mystical practices such as sensory deprivation or mind-control techniques, hypnosis, meditation, prayer, or mystical disciplines such as mantra meditation, yoga, Sufism, dream yoga, or surat shabda yoga. Some practices encourage spiritual experiences through the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with entheogenic plants and substances such as cannabis, salvia divinorum, psilocybin mushrooms, peyote, DXM, ayahuasca, or datura. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves psychoacoustics, binaural beats, or light-and-sound stimulation. Newberg and Newberg provide a view on spiritual experience. = Social experience = Growing up and living within a society can foster the development and observation of social experience. Compare: Social experience provides individuals with the skills and habits necessary for participating within their own societies, as a society itself is formed through a plurality of shared experiences forming norms, customs, values, traditions, social roles, symbols and languages. Experience plays an important role in experiential groups. = Virtual experience (VX) = Using computer simulations can enable a person or groups of persons to have virtual experiences in virtual reality. Compare: Role-playing games treat \\"experience\\" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many role-playing video games, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called experience points or XP.  Immediacy of experience  Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has \\"first hand experience\\". First hand experience of the \\"you had to be there\\" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in sense-perception and in personal interpretation. Second- hand experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple points of view. Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable rumour or hearsay, can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of authority.  Changes through history  Some post-modernists suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the modern to the post-modern. Compare: = Immanuel Kant = Immanuel Kant contrasted experience with reason: :\\"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas.\\" These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of ideasthesia, which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ideas) about the objects that are being experienced.

He was in Switzerland at the time of the indictment and never returned to the United States. He received a widely criticised presidential pardon from U.S. President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office; Rich had made large donations in his lifetime to the Democratic Party and Israeli organizations. Early life, marriage, and career Rich was born in 1934 to a Jewish family in Antwerp, Belgium.Los Angeles Times: \\"Pardon Reignites Jewish Stereotypes\\" by WALTER REICH February 25, 2001 His parents emigrated with their son to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. His father opened a jewelry store in Kansas City, Missouri, then moved the family to Queens, New York City in 1950, where he started a company that imported Bengali jute to make burlap bags, and later started a business trading agricultural products and helped found the American Bolivian Bank. Rich attended high school at the Rhodes Preparatory School in Manhattan. He later attended New York University, but dropped out after one semester to go work for Philipp Brothers (now known as Phibro LLC) in 1954 where he worked with Pincus Green. At Philipp Brothers, he eventually became a dealer in metals, learning about the international raw materials markets and commercial trading with poor, third-world nations. He helped run the company's operations in Cuba, Bolivia, and Spain. In 1974, he and co- worker Pincus Green set up their own company in Switzerland, Marc Rich + Co. AG, which would later become Glencore Xstrata Plc. Nicknamed \\"the King of Oil\\" by his business partners, Rich has been said to have expanded the spot market for crude oil in the early 1970s, drawing business away from the larger established oil companies that had relied on traditional long-term contracts for future purchases. As Andrew Hill of the Financial Times put it, \\"Rich's key insight was that oil ‚Äì and other raw materials ‚Äì could be traded with less capital, and fewer assets, than the big oil producers thought, if backed by bank finance. It was this leveraged business model that became the template for modern traders, including Trafigura, Vitol, and Glencore\\". His tutelage under Philipp Brothers afforded Rich the opportunity to develop relationships with various dictatorial r√©gimes and embargoed nations. Rich would later tell biographer Daniel Ammann that he had made his \\"most important and most profitable\\" business deals by violating international trade embargoes and doing business with the apartheid regime of South Africa. He also counted Fidel Castro's Cuba, Marxist Angola, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's Romania, and Augusto Pinochet's Chile among the clients he serviced. According to Ammann, \\"he had no regrets whatsoever.... He used to say 'I deliver a service. People want to sell oil to me and other people wanted to buy oil from me. I am a businessman, not a politician.\\" Later, following the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, during the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Rich used his special relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, to buy oil from Iran despite the American embargo. Iran would become Rich's most important supplier of crude oil for more than 15 years. Rich sold Iranian oil to Israel through a secret pipeline. Due to his good relationship with Iran and Ayatollah Khomeini, Rich helped give Mossad's agents contacts in Iran. His real estate company, Marc Rich Real Estate GmbH, was involved in large developer projects (e.g., in Prague, Czech Republic).\\"Former U.S. fugitive has local ties\\" , Michael Mainville, The Prague Post, 28 February 2001 Rich and Marvin Davis bought 20th Century Fox in 1981. Due to the indictment filed against Rich for violating U.S. trade sanctions against his deals with Iran while Rich was living in Switzerland, his assets including his holding in 20th Century Fox were frozen. Davis was permitted by authorities to purchase Rich's holding and subsequently sold this to Rupert Murdoch for $232 million during March 1984. Business Insider reported Rich had an estimated net worth of US$2.5 billion.https://www.businessinsider.com/biography-marc-rich-2013-6 U.S. indictment and pardon 2001 The Controversial Pardon of International Fugitive Marc Rich In 1983, Rich and partner Pincus Green were indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo (at a time when Iranian revolutionaries were still holding American citizens hostage). The charges would have led to a sentence of more than 300 years in prison had Rich been convicted on all counts. The indictment was filed by then-U.S. Federal Prosecutor (and future mayor of New York City) Rudolph Giuliani. At the time it was the biggest tax evasion case in U.S. history. Learning of the plans for the indictment, Rich fled to Switzerland and, always insisting that he was not guilty, never returned to the U.S. to answer the charges. Rich's companies eventually pleaded guilty to 35 counts of tax evasion and paid $90 million in fines, although Rich himself remained on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Ten Most-Wanted Fugitives List for many years, narrowly evading capture in Britain, Germany, Finland, and Jamaica. Fearing arrest, he did not even return to the United States to attend his daughter's funeral in 1996. On January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, U.S. President Bill Clinton granted Rich a controversial presidential pardon. Several of Clinton's strongest supporters distanced themselves from the decision. Former President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Democrat, said, \\"I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion, that was disgraceful.\\" Clinton himself later expressed regret for issuing the pardon, saying that \\"it wasn't worth the damage to my reputation.\\" Clinton's critics alleged that Rich's pardon had been bought, as Denise Rich had given more than $1 million to Clinton's political party (the Democratic Party), including more than $100,000 to the Senate campaign of the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation during Clinton's time in office. Clinton also cited clemency pleas he had received from Israeli government officials, including then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Rich had made substantial donations to Israeli charitable foundations over the years, and many senior Israeli officials, such as Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert, argued on his behalf behind the scenes. Many leading figures of the Jewish world such as Abraham Foxman, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), whose organization had received over $250,000 from Rich over the years also wrote to President Clinton for Rich's pardon. Among other leading Jewish leaders writing to Clinton were Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's former foreign minister; Michael Steinhardt, a philanthropist and CEO of Steinhardt Associates; and Rabbi Irving Greenberg, chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Although none of the figures other than Foxman were investigated for their support of Rich's pardon, Clinton later claimed on more than one occasion that Jewish pressure contributed to his decision to pardon Rich. He stated in an interview with New York Times that \\"Israeli officials of both major political parties and leaders of Jewish communities in America and Europe urged the pardon of Mr. Rich.\\" He made similar comments off camera to CNBC Geraldo Rivera that \\"Israel did influence me profoundly\\". Speculation about another rationale for Rich's pardon involved his alleged involvement with the Israeli intelligence community.\\"The real reason Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich\\", Joe Conason, Salon, January 16, 2009 Rich reluctantly acknowledged in interviews with his biographer, Daniel Ammann, that he had assisted the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service, a claim that Ammann said was confirmed by a former Israeli intelligence officer. According to Ammann, Rich had helped finance the Mossad's operations and had supplied Israel with strategic amounts of Iranian oil through a secret oil pipeline. The aide to Rich who had persuaded Denise Rich to personally ask President Clinton to review Rich's pardon request was a former chief of the Mossad, Avner Azulay. Another former Mossad chief, Shabtai Shavit, had also urged Clinton to pardon Rich, who he said had routinely allowed intelligence agents to use his offices around the world. Federal Prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed by Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate Clinton's last-minute pardon of Rich. She stepped down before the investigation was finished and was replaced by James Comey, who was critical of Clinton's pardons and of then-Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder's pardon recommendation. Rich's lawyer, Jack Quinn, had previously been Clinton's White House Counsel and chief of staff to Clinton's Vice President, Al Gore, and had had a close relationship with Holder. According to Quinn, Holder had advised that standard procedures be bypassed and the pardon petition be submitted directly to the White House. Congressional investigations were also launched. Clinton's top advisors, Chief of Staff John Podesta, White House Counsel Beth Nolan, and advisor Bruce Lindsey, testified that nearly all of the White House staff advising the president on the pardon request had urged Clinton to not grant Rich a pardon. Federal investigators ultimately found no evidence of criminal activity. As a condition of the pardon, it was made clear that Rich would drop all procedural defenses against any civil actions brought against him by the United States upon his return there. That condition was consistent with the position that his alleged wrongdoing warranted only civil penalties, not criminal punishment. Rich never returned to the United States. In a February 18, 2001, op-ed essay in The New York Times, Clinton (by then out of office) explained why he had pardoned Rich, noting that U.S. tax professors Bernard Wolfman of the Harvard Law School and Martin Ginsburg of Georgetown University Law Center had concluded that no crime had been committed, and that Rich's companies' tax-reporting position had been reasonable. In the same essay, Clinton listed Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby as one of three \\"distinguished Republican lawyers\\" who supported a pardon for Rich. (Libby himself later received a presidential commutation from President George W. Bush, and later a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump for his involvement in the Plame affair.) During Congressional hearings after Rich's pardon, Libby, who had represented Rich from 1985 until the spring of 2000, denied that Rich had violated the tax laws but criticized him for trading with Iran at a time when that country was holding U.S. hostages. A New York Times editorial called the Marc Rich pardon \\"a shocking abuse of presidential power.\\"The New York Times: An Indefensible Pardon, JAN. 24, 2001 On November 1, 2016, the FBI released documents related to the pardon, stating it was an FOIA release. Paradise Papers In November 5, 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that the Appleby law firm had worked for Rich and Glencore on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.

He also held Belgian, Bolivian, Israeli, and Spanish passports.  Philanthropy  Rich was a strong supporter of Israel throughout his life, having donated around $150 million to institutions such as the Israel Museum, Tel Aviv Museum, research centers, theaters, as well as numerous other documented causes over the years. In 1985, Rich helped with the compensation to the families of the victims of Israelis from Ras Burka in the Sinai. He has contributed tens of millions of dollars for the absorption of Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia and Russia, he has contributed to Project Discovery, he has founded the museum wing for Israeli and international art in the name of his daughter Gabriela, who had died, he has contributed to the establishment of the new building of the Tel Aviv Cinematheque called \\"Marc Rich Israeli Cinema Center\\", and the establishment of the main library at IDC Herzliya University, which bears his name. Rich was also an advocate for coexistence between Israelis and the Palestinians by establishing health and education programs in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as by fulfilling his commitment to making President's Conference contributions each year. Rich has also contributed to the Center for Sloan-Catherine, The Medical Research Center at Yale University, The Rabin Medical Center,source at The Rabin Medical Center 30 January 2017 accessed 30 January 2017 and the center of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

He was a committed Puritan, and he opposed the negotiations for marriage between Queen Elizabeth I and Francis, Duke of Anjou, a Roman Catholic who was the brother of the King of France. Publication of French Marriage pamphlet In 1579 he put his opinions into a pamphlet entitled The Discovery of a Gaping Gulf whereunto England is like to be swallowed by another French Marriage, if the Lord forbid not the banns, by letting her Majesty see the sin and punishment thereof.Stump, Donald and Felch, Susan. Elizabeth 1 And Her Age. W.W. Norton & Company Inc, 2009, p. 282. Copies of the text were later publicly burned in the kitchen stove of Stationer's Hall. The pamphlet argued that at forty-six years old Elizabeth was too old to have children and therefore had no need for marriage. He argued that English values, customs, language and morality would be undermined by so close a relationship with the French monarchy. Stubbs argued that his objective was to protect the freedom of thought and free speech that he said was associated with Protestantism. The proposed marriage could lead to a restoration of Catholic orthodoxy with its diminution of liberty. Stubbs undiplomatically described the proposed wedding as a \\"contrary coupling,\\" \\"an immoral union, an uneven yoking of the clean ox to the unclean ass, a thing forbidden in the law\\" as laid down by St. Paul, a \\"more foul and more gross\\" union that would draw the wrath of God on England and leave the English \\"pressed down with the heavy loins of a worse people and beaten as with scorpions by a more vile nation.\\" Trial, punishment, and further writing Elizabeth's court were displeased by the publication. Circulation of this pamphlet was prohibited, and Stubbs, his printer, and publisher were tried at Westminster, found guilty of \\"seditious writing\\", and sentenced to have their right hands cut off by means of a cleaver driven through the wrist by a mallet. Initially Queen Elizabeth had favoured the death penalty but was persuaded by adviser John Jovey to opt for the lesser sentence. The printer was subsequently pardoned by Elizabeth, but in the case of Stubbs and his publisher the sentence was carried out, and Stubbs' right hand was cut off on 3 November 1579. At the time Stubbs protested his loyalty to the Crown, and immediately before the public dismemberment delivered a shocking pun: \\"Pray for me now my calamity is at hand.\\"\\"Dismembering and Forgetting in Titus Andronicus\\".

He was an ordained priest, but was never a bishop. His main role was setting up colleges to train English missionary priests with the mission of returning secretly to England to keep Roman Catholicism alive there. Allen assisted in the planning of the Spanish Armada's attempted invasion of England in 1588. It failed badly, but if it had succeeded he would probably have been made Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. The Douai-Rheims Bible, a complete translation into English from the Latin, was printed under Allen's orders. His activities were part of the Counter Reformation, but they led to an intense response in England and in Ireland. He advised and recommended Pope Pius V to pronounce Elizabeth I deposed. After the Pope declared her excommunicated and deposed, Elizabeth intensified the persecution of her Roman Catholic religious opponents. William Cecil said to Elizabeth \\"The Papist humors by your Queen Majesty's lenity grow too rank.\\" Early life Allen was born in 1532, at Rossall Hall in Rossall, Lancashire, England. He was the third son of John Allen by his marriage to Jane Lister. In 1547, at the age of fifteen, he entered Oriel College, Oxford, graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1550, and was elected a Fellow of his College.

Upon the accession of Elizabeth I, he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, but was allowed to remain at the University of Oxford until 1561. His public opposition to the newly Protestantized Church of England forced him to leave the country, and in 1561, after resigning his benefices, he left England to seek refuge at Louvain and its University, where he joined many other academics from Oxford and Cambridge who had refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. There, he continued his theological studies and began to write apologetic, polemic, and controversialist treatises. In the following year, because of ill health, he was advised to return to his native Lancashire. He devoted himself to the re- conversion of his native land to the old faith. In particular, he worked to dissuade the Roman Catholic faithful from attending Anglican worship, an outward compromise of their faith and conscience that many made, to avoid ruin from fines, confiscations, and other disabilities. During this period as a clandestine missionary in England, Allen formed the conviction that the people were not set against Rome by choice, but by force and by circumstances; and the majority were only too ready, in response to his sermons and ministrations, to return to Roman Catholicism. He was convinced that the Protestant hold over the Kingdom, favoured by the policies of Elizabeth, could only be temporary. When his presence was discovered by the Queen's agents, he fled from Lancashire and withdrew to Oxford, where he had many acquaintances. After writing a treatise in defence of the power of the priest to remit sins, Allen was obliged to move to Norfolk, under the protection of the family of the Duke of Norfolk, but already in 1565 had once again to leave for the Continent. He was never to return. Travelling to the Low Countries, he was ordained as a priest shortly afterwards at Malines in Flanders and began to lecture in theology at the Benedictine College there. College at Douai Allen was always convinced that the Protestant wave over the country, due to the action of Elizabeth, could only be temporary, and that the whole future depended on there being a supply of trained clergy and controversialists ready to come into the country whenever Catholicism should be restored. In 1567, Allen went to Rome for the first time and conceived his plans for establishing a College where students from England and Wales could live together and finish their theological education. The idea subsequently developed into the establishment of a missionary college, or seminary, to supply England with priests as long as the schism with the See of Rome persisted. With the help of friends, and notably of the Benedictine abbots of the neighbouring monasteries, a beginning was made in a rented house at Douai on Michaelmas Day, 29 September 1568, which marked the inauguration of the English College, Douai. Allen was to be joined by many English exiles, including Edmund Campion. Douai was thought suitable for Allen's new College because of the recent foundation there of the University of Douai by Pope Paul IV, under the patronage of King Philip II of Spain, to whose dominions Douai then belonged, and because the foundation had the active encouragement of Jean Vendeville, a law professor at the university, who had accompanied Allen on his journey back from Rome. On 31 January 1570, through the influence of Vendeville, Allen was given the post of Professor of Sacred Scripture.Brady, William Maziere. The episcopal succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, A.D. 1400 to 1875, Vol. 3, Tipografia Della Pace, 1877, pp. 37 et seq. Allen's College became central to the \\"English mission\\" for the re-conversion of England. Amongst the \\"seminary priests\\", as they were called, over 160 former students from Douai are known to have been put to death under the Penal Laws; more were imprisoned. Students celebrated the news of each martyrdom, and, by special dispensation, said a solemn Mass of thanksgiving. Rome and Rheims Title page from the 1582 Douai-Rheims New Testament, \\"specially for the discouerie of the CORRVPTIONS of diuers late translations, and for cleering the CONTROVERSIES in religion.\\" The number of students at the new college rose rapidly to one hundred and twenty, and the Pope summoned Allen to Rome to establish a similar college there. In 1575 Allen made a second journey to Rome, where by order of Pope Gregory XIII he assisted in the establishment of the English College at Rome. To that end, the ancient English Hospice in Rome was taken over and converted into a seminary for the sending of missionaries to England, and Jesuits were placed in the College to assist Maurice Clenock DD, Rector of the College. The Pope appointed Allen to be a Canon in Courtray (now in West Flanders, Belgium, and known as Kortrijk), and he returned to Douai in July 1576, but there he had to face a new difficulty. Besides the plots to assassinate him by agents of the Queen of England, the rebels against the rule of the Spanish Crown, encouraged by Elizabeth and her emissaries, now present in Douai, expelled the students of the University from Douai in March 1578. Allen then re-established the College at Rheims, a city then under the patronage and protection of the House of Guise. The collegians took refuge at the University of Rheims, where they were well received, and continued their work as before, and Allen was soon afterwards elected a canon in the Chapter of Rheims Cathedral. Thomas Stapleton, Richard Bristow, Gregory Martin, and Morgan Phillips were amongst Allen's companions. From the College press came a constant stream of polemic, controversialist, and other Roman Catholic literature, which for obvious reasons could not be printed in England. Allen took a prominent part in this. One of the chief works undertaken in the early years of the College was the preparation under Allen's direction of the well- known Douai Bible, a translation from the Latin into English. The New Testament was published in 1582, when the College was at Rheims; but the Old Testament, although completed at the same time, was delayed, due to a lack of funds. It was eventually printed and published at Douai, in 1609, two years before the Authorized King James Version prepared on James's orders by the Church of England. Political activism In 1577 Allen began a correspondence with the Jesuit priest Robert Parsons. Allen was again summoned to Rome in 1579, and was charged with suppressing an insurrection within the English College, caused by contrasts between students from Wales and the rest of the students from England. It was during this visit that he was appointed as one of the Commissioners charged with submitting proposals for the revision of the Latin Vulgate Bible. Brought into personal contact with Parsons, Allen was captivated by his personality and charisma, and Parsons became a trusted friend. Under Allen's orders, the English College at Rome was placed under the control of the Society of Jesus, as part of a plan to send Jesuit missionaries to England by 1580. Under Allen's instructions, the first Jesuits to be sent, Parsons and Edmund Campion, were to work closely in England with other Roman Catholic priests. The mission met with little success, as Campion was put to death only after a year's work, and Parsons again had to flee to mainland Europe. King Philip II of Spain recommended Allen to become a Cardinal with the Pope in 1587. Allen himself saw his work as \\"scholastical attempts\\" to end the English schism from Rome. His efforts to secure this were completely unsuccessful, and arguably made matters worse for supporters of the Church of Rome in England, Wales, and Ireland. Pope Pius V, in his papal bull Regnans in Excelsis (1570), sentenced Elizabeth to both excommunication and \\"deposition\\" from the throne, and, upon the pain of excommunication, \\"released and forbade\\" her subjects from their allegiance to the Queen. Returning to Rheims, Allen allowed himself to be drawn into the political intrigues of Parsons for the furtherance of Philip's interests in England and Ireland. Parsons had already resolved to remove Allen from the seminary at Rheims, and to that end, as far back as 6 April 1581, had recommended Allen to Philip II of Spain, with a view to the King's securing Allen's appointment as a cardinal. On 18 September 1581, Pope Gregory XIII named Allen \\"Prefect of the English Mission\\". Allen and Parsons went to Rome again in 1585, and there Allen remained for the rest of his life. In 1587, whilst he was the subject of the intrigue by Philip's agents, he wrote, helped by Parsons, a book in defence of Sir William Stanley, an English officer who had surrendered the town of Deventer in Overijssel, part of the territory of the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, to King Philip's armies. Allen wrote that all Englishmen were obliged, under the pain of eternal damnation, to follow that example, as Elizabeth was \\"no lawful queen\\" in the eyes of God. Allen helped in the planning of the attempted Spanish invasion of England, and would probably have been made Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor if it had been successful. Allen was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England under the Pope, and in this position, just after the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, he wrote to Philip II on 19 March 1587 to encourage him to undertake an invasion of England, stating that the Roman Catholics in England (and in Ireland) were clamouring for the King of Spain to come and punish \\"this woman, hated by God and man\\". He was made a Cardinal by Pope Sixtus V on 7 August 1587. Spanish Armada Portrait of Elizabeth made to commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada, depicted in the background. Allen was then once more in Rome, having been summoned by the pope after a dangerous illness two years before. He never left the city of Rome again, but he kept in constant correspondence and communication with his countrymen back in England. It had been due to his influence that the Society of Jesus, to which he was greatly attached, undertook to join in the work of the English mission; and now Allen and Father Parsons became joint leaders of the \\"Spanish Party\\" amongst the Roman Catholics in England and in Ireland. On the advice and recommendation of King Philip, Allen was created a Cardinal in 1587, and he was prepared to return to England immediately, should the invasion prove successful. Amongst the adherents to the scheme, however, Allen and Parsons were both equally at fault. The vast majority of the remaining Roman Catholic faithful in the Kingdom of England remained loyal to their own Queen against Spain and King Philip, and to them the defeat of the Spanish Armada, in 1588, was an event that gave cause to rejoice, no less than their fellow countrymen who were Anglicans and Protestants. Allen outlived the defeat of the Armada by some six years. To the end of his life, he reportedly remained fully convinced that the people of England and their Sovereign would soon become Roman Catholics once again. Upon his elevation, Allen wrote to the English College at Rheims that he owed his Cardinal's hat (also) to Parsons. One of his first acts was to order the publication, under his own name and authority, of two works for the purpose of inciting Roman Catholics in England to rise up against Elizabeth: The Declaration of the Sentence of Sixtus V, a broadside, and a book, An Admonition to the nobility and people of England (Antwerp, 1588). After the failure of the Armada, Philip, to rid himself of the burden of the financial costs of supporting Allen as Cardinal, nominated him to become Archbishop of Malines. This, however, never received the Pope's confirmation. Last years Pope Gregory XIV granted and bestowed on Allen the title of Prefect of the Vatican Library. In 1589, he assisted in the establishment of the English College at Valladolid in Spain. He took part in four Conclaves of the Church, although his influence diminished after the failure of the Armada. Before his death in Rome, he appeared to have changed his mind about the wisdom of Jesuit politics in Rome and in England. Certainly, his political activities could give grounds and cause for Elizabeth's government to regard the English seminaries on the Continent as hotbeds of treason. Allen continued to reside at the English College, Rome, until his death. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, as a Cardinal he had lived in poverty and died in debt at Rome on 16 October 1594. He was buried in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity adjoining the College. Legacy Allen's foundations at Douai survive today in two seminaries, one being the Venerable English College, Rome founded in 1579 by Allen and Pope Gregory XIII, which still bears the coat of arms of Allen as the college crest; the other being Allen Hall, Chelsea, in London, successor in spirit to Saint Edmund's College, Ware. Until 2011, when it closed, there also existed Saint Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, or Ushaw College, near Durham, in the north of England, where the College's coat-of-arms, granted by the Earl Marshal, who was also the Duke of Norfolk, incorporated the three hares or coneys from Allen's ancestral arms. The English College at Valladolid continues to prepare and educate Englishmen and Welshmen for the priesthood. Cardinal Allen Catholic High School in Fleetwood, Lancashire, near Allen's place of birth, is named in his honour. Until it closed about 1980, there was another secondary school named after Allen in Enfield, Middlesex, and a grammar school for boys in West Derby, Liverpool, carried his name until 1983, when it was renamed Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School.

Impermanence, also known as the philosophical problem of change, is a philosophical concept that is addressed in a variety of religions and philosophies. In Eastern philosophy it is best known for its role in the Buddhist three marks of existence. It also is an element of Hinduism. In Western philosophy it is most famously known through its first appearance in Greek philosophy in the writings of Heraclitus and his doctrine of panta rhei (everything flows). In Western philosophy the concept is also called becoming. Indian religion The Pali word for impermanence, anicca, is a compound word consisting of \\"a\\" meaning non-, and \\"nicca\\" meaning \\"constant, continuous, permanent\\". While 'nicca' is the concept of continuity and permanence, 'anicca' refers to its exact opposite; the absence of permanence and continuity. The term is synonymous with the Sanskrit term anitya (a + nitya). The concept of impermanence is prominent in Buddhism, and it is also found in various schools of Hinduism and Jainism. The term also appears in the Rigveda. =Buddhism= According to Buddhism, living beings go through many births. Buddhism does not teach the existence of a permanent, immutable soul. The birth of one form from another is part of a process of continuous change. Impermanence, called anicca (PƒÅli) or anitya (Sanskrit) appears extensively in the Pali Canon as one of the essential doctrines of Buddhism., Quote: \\"All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence.\\" The doctrine asserts that all of conditioned existence, without exception, is \\"transient, evanescent, inconstant\\". All temporal things, whether material or mental, are compounded objects in a continuous change of condition, subject to decline and destruction. All physical and mental events are not metaphysically real. They are not constant or permanent; they come into being and dissolve. Anicca is understood in Buddhism as the first of the three marks of existence (trilakshana), the other two being dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness) and anatta (non-self, non-soul, no essence).Anicca Buddhism, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013); Anatta Buddhism, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013); It appears in Pali texts as, \\"sabbe sankhara anicca, sabbe sankhara dukkha, sabbe dhamma anatta\\", which Szczurek translates as, \\"all conditioned things are impermanent, all conditioned things are painful, all dhammas are without Self\\". All physical and mental events, states Buddhism, come into being and dissolve.Anicca Buddhism, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013) Human life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of repeated birth and death (Samsara), nothing lasts, and everything decays. This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including beings who have reincarnated in deva (god) and naraka (hell) realms. Anicca is intimately associated with the doctrine of anatta, according to which things have no essence, permanent self, or unchanging soul.Anatta Buddhism, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013)[a] [b] , Quote: \\"(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps - the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering.\\" [c] , Quote: \\"(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon.\\" The Buddha taught that because no physical or mental object is permanent, desires for or attachments to either causes suffering (dukkha). Understanding Anicca and Anatta are steps in the Buddhist's spiritual progress toward enlightenment. Everything, whether physical or mental, is a formation (Sa·πÖkhƒÅra), has a dependent origination and is impermanent. It arises, changes and disappears. According to Buddhism, everything in human life, all objects, as well as all beings whether in heavenly or hellish or earthly realms in Buddhist cosmology, is always changing, inconstant, undergoes rebirth and redeath (Samsara). This impermanence is a source of dukkha. This is in contrast to nirvana, the reality that is nicca, or knows no change, decay or death. Rupert Gethin on Four Noble Truths says: =Hinduism= The term Anitya (‡§Ö‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø), in the sense of impermanence of objects and life, appears in verse 1.2.10 of the Katha Upanishad, one of the Principal Upanishads of Hinduism.Katha Upanishad 1.2.10, Wikisource; Quote: ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§π‡§Ç ‡§∂‡•á‡§µ‡§ß‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ‡•à‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡§ø ‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§§‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§É ‡§Ö‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•• ‡•ß‡•¶‡••Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 283 with footnote 1 It asserts that everything in the world is impermanent, but impermanent nature of things is an opportunity to obtain what is permanent (nitya) as the Hindu scripture presents its doctrine about Atman (soul). The term Anitya also appears in the Bhagavad Gita in a similar context. Buddhism and Hinduism share the doctrine of Anicca or Anitya, that is \\"nothing lasts, everything is in constant state of change\\"; however, they disagree on the Anatta doctrine, that is whether soul exists or not. Even in the details of their respective impermanence theories, state Frank Hoffman and Deegalle Mahinda, Buddhist and Hindu traditions differ. Change associated with Anicca and associated attachments produces sorrow or Dukkha asserts Buddhism and therefore need to be discarded for liberation (nibbana), while Hinduism asserts that not all change and attachments lead to Dukkha and some change ‚Äì mental or physical or self-knowledge ‚Äì leads to happiness and therefore need to be sought for liberation (moksha). The Nicca (permanent) in Buddhism is anatta (non-soul), the Nitya in Hinduism is atman (soul). Western philosophy Impermanence first appears in Greek philosophy in the writings of Heraclitus and his doctrine of panta rhei (everything flows). Heraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever-present change as being the fundamental essence of the universe, as stated in the famous saying, \\"No man ever steps in the same river twice\\"This is how Plato puts Heraclitus' doctrine. See Cratylus, 402a. This is commonly considered to be a key contribution in the development of the philosophical concept of becoming, as contrasted with \\"being\\", and has sometimes been seen in a dialectical relationship with Parmenides' statement that \\"whatever is, is, and what is not cannot be\\", the latter being understood as a key contribution in the development of the philosophical concept of being. For this reason, Parmenides and Heraclitus are commonly considered to be two of the founders of ontology. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom has varied over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Heraclitus' position was complemented by his stark commitment to a unity of opposites in the world, stating that \\"the path up and down are one and the same\\". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that \\"all entities come to be in accordance with this Logos\\" (literally, \\"word\\", \\"reason\\", or \\"account\\") has been the subject of numerous interpretations. Impermanence was widely but not universally accepted among subsequent Greek philosophers. Democritus' theory of atoms entailed that assemblages of atoms were impermanent.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#2 Pyrrho declared that everything was astathmƒìta (unstable), and anepikrita (unfixed). Plutarch commented on impermanence saying \\"And if the nature which is measured is subject to the same conditions as the time which measures it, this nature itself has no permanence, nor \\"being,\\" but is becoming and perishing according to its relation to time.Plutarch, On the ‚ÄúE‚Äù at Delphi The Stoic philosopher, Marcus Aurelius' Meditations contains many comments about impermanence, such as ‚ÄúBear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to rot.‚Äù (10.18)https://www.phillipwells.com/2015/04/marcus-aurelius-on- impermanence.html Plato rejected impermanence, arguing against Heraclitus:Cratylus Paragraph 440 sections c-d. > How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state? ... for at > the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other ... so that > you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state .... but if that > which knows and that which is known exist ever ... then I do not think they > can resemble a process or flux .... Several famous Roman Latin sayings are about impermanence, including Omnia mutantur, Sic transit gloria mundi, and Tempora mutantur. = The Eleatics = Change was one of the chief concerns of the Eleatic school of thought founded by Parmenides. Parmenides considered non-existence to be absurd, and thus asserted that it was impossible for something to come into existence out of nothing, or for something to pass out of existence into nothing. By \\"something\\", he was referring not just to material, but to any general predicate; rejecting, for instance, changes of color, as they involved the new color arising from nothing and the old colour passing into nothing. He therefore rejected all change as impossible, and claimed that reality was an undifferentiated and unchanging whole. These ideas were taken up by various followers of Parmenides, most notably Melissus and Zeno, who provided additional arguments, specifically for the impossibility of motion. Melissus claimed that reality was \\"full\\" (nonexistence being impossible), and that therefore nothing could move. Zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential. Among the simplest was his observation that to move from A to B, one must first reach the halfway point between A and B; but then in order to do this, one must get halfway from A to this halfway point; and so on. Thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps, which Zeno held to be impossible. A similar argument involved a footrace between Achilles and a tortoise. The tortoise is given a head start. Achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood, but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little, so Achilles must now reach this new point, and so on. A different argument involved the flight of an arrow. Zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time, the arrow is not moving in that moment. He then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise as the result of a sequence of motionless arrows. = Responses to the Eleatics = The atomism of Democritus and Leucippus can be seen as a response to the Eleatic denial of change. The atomists conceded that something coming from or becoming nothing was impossible, but only with respect to material substance, not to general qualities. They hypothesized that every visible object was in fact a composite of unseen indivisible particles of different shapes and sizes. These particles were held to be eternal and unchanging, but by rearranging themselves, the composite objects which they formed could come into and go out of being. These composite objects and their properties were not taken as truly real; in the words of Democritus, \\"by convention sweet, by convention bitter; by convention hot, by convention cold; by convention color: but in reality atoms and void.\\" Any perceived change in an object's properties was therefore illusory and not susceptible to the objections of Parmenides. Anaxagoras provided a similar response, but instead of atoms, he hypothesized a number of eternal, primal \\"ingredients\\" which were mixed together in a continuum. No material object was made of a pure ingredient; rather, it had its material character due to a preponderance of various ingredients over every other. In this way, Anaxagoras could assert that nowhere did any ingredient ever fully come into or go out of being. = Pyrrhonism = According to the Silk Road philologist, Christopher I. Beckwith, the ancient Greek philosopher, Pyrrho, based his new philosophy, Pyrrhonism, on elements of Early Buddhism, most particularly the Buddhist three marks of existence. Pyrrho accompanied Alexander the Great on his Indian campaign, spending about 18 months in Taxila studying Indian philosophy. Diogenes La√´rtius' biography of Pyrrho reports that Pyrrho based his philosophy on what he learned there: > ...he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the Magi. Owing > to which circumstance, he seems to have taken a noble line in philosophy, > introducing the doctrine of acatalepsy (incomprehensibility), and of the > necessity of epoche (suspending one's judgment).... A summary of Pyrrho's philosophy was preserved by Eusebius, quoting Aristocles, quoting Pyrrho's student Timon, in what is known as the \\"Aristocles passage.\\" > \\"Whoever wants to live well (eudaimonia) must consider these three > questions: First, how are pragmata (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by > nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what > will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?\\" Pyrrho's answer is > that \\"As for pragmata they are all adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical > differentia), astathmƒìta (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and > anepikrita (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense- > perceptions nor our doxai (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or > lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be adoxastoi > (without views), aklineis (uninclined toward this side or that), and > akradantoi (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single > one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither > is nor is not. According to Beckwith's analysis of the Aristocles Passage, Pyrrho translated the Buddhist concept of anicca into Greek as anepikrita, i.e., that pragmata (issues, things, dharmas) are unfixed. They keep changing, and as such cannot be judged.

Once a tributary of the River Thames, flows from the Effra were incorporated in the Victorian era into a combined sewer draining much of the historic area of Peckham and Brixton. Etymology The etymology of the name \\"Effra\\" has been much disputed. There is no evidence that it was applied to the stream before the late 18th century, and early 19th century gazetteers gave it no name.Bonner, A. \\"Surrey Place-names\\" in Surrey Archaeological Collections v XXXVII, pp.126-7 A map of 1744 refers to it as the \\"Shore\\",The Effra and Lambeth Marsh, vauxhallandkennington.org, accessed 12-07-18 and it was also referred to as \\"Brixton Creek\\"Parliamentary Papers: 1780-1849, V. 52, Part 7, p.135 and \\"the Wash\\". Unlikely suggestions for the name's origin include Ruskin's, that it was \\"shortened from [the Latin word] Effrena\\",Bonner, p.128 that it was from a Celtic root \\"yfrid\\", or that it derived from Anglo-Saxon \\"efer\\", \\"bank\\",Mills, A. D. A Dictionary of London Place-Names, OUP, p.83 perhaps via \\"heah efre\\" (\\"high bank\\") recorded in a charter of 693 for a spot on the bank of the Thames. A more recent suggestion is that the name is a corruption of the place-name \\"Heathrow\\", the name of a manor which once covered some 70 acres south of present day Coldharbour Lane and east of present day Effra Road.Survey of London (1956) v.26, The Parish of St Mary Lambeth, LCC, p.137 By the 1790s the land making up the Manor of Heathrow was known as Effra Farm. There is evidence that the name was first applied to the stream at Brixton, perhaps taken from the name of the farm, and was only later extended to the rest of its course. A 2016 book by the Lambeth borough archivist supports this view, suggesting that other etymologies are a product of 19th century antiquarianism. History =Before the 19th century= The drainage basin of the stream covered around 20 square kilometres (8 sq miles) of present-day inner south London. Historically the Effra was fed partly by a line of springs that emerged at between 80 and 100 metres above sea level along the 5 km ridge of the Great North Wood, where a layer of gravels overlies the impermeable London Clay.Knight, M. The Effra in Dulwich, accessed 12-08-18 There were also springs at a lower level in Dulwich; the various tributaries met near Brixton before flowing to the Thames. The lowest part of the river was diverted as early as the 13th century, after the monks of Bermondsey Priory made an agreement with neighbouring landowners to end flooding problems. Before that time the river's course ran either into Walworth Marsh, which after draining became Walworth Common, or into the Earl's Sluice to reach the Thames. The lower, northern part of the river appeared in Ogilby's Britannia of 1675 as the \\"New River\\". While the upper, southern parts of the river were rural, they became increasingly suburbanised as the 19th century went on. The art critic John Ruskin, who grew up at Herne Hill close to one of the Effra's tributaries, described \\"the good I got out of the tadpole-haunted ditch in Croxted Lane\\",Ruskin, Praeterita, p.76 and made an early sketch of a bridge over it. Until about 1850 Brixton Road, where it ran along the course of the stream, was known as the \\"Washway\\", and the stream itself was often called the \\"Wash\\". By that time the Effra was heavily polluted with domestic waste, due to increasing development along its course, and by 1821 it was classed as an open sewer downstream of North Brixton.The Town Planning Review, Volume 25 (1954), 74 It still often flooded in heavy rain, and residents of Brixton Road and South Lambeth repeatedly complained of their houses being inundated. In 1847 the commissioners of the Surrey and East Kent Sewers, under the direction of surveyor Joseph Gwilt, carried out works \\"arching over\\" (culverting) the Effra\\"Construction\\" in The Artizan, v 1 Third Series (1847), 279 as far upstream as Herne Hill. =Post-industrial revolution= When the London sewerage system was constructed during the mid-19th century, its designer Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated flows from the River Effra into the southern division of the system. The Effra Branch Sewer, about 3 miles in length and costing some ¬£19,400 to construct,\\"Metropolitan Improvements\\". The Athenaeum n.1947 (18 February 1865), 235 received much of the Effra's surface water and ran from the Norwood area into the Southern High Level Sewer at Croxted Lane. The Southern High Level itself ran from Herne Hill eastwards under Peckham and New Cross to Deptford. Here it joined the Southern Low Level Sewer, which picked up remaining effluent from the old depression converted to sewer at Vauxhall and passed under Kennington and Burgess Park to Deptford; the two branches merging to form the Southern Outfall Sewer that runs underneath Greenwich and Woolwich to Crossness. As the area was increasingly urbanised, the remaining parts of the Effra's upper course were incorporated into the surface water drainage system, although some parts remained open and marked on Ordnance Survey maps until the later 19th century. The main course of the Effra remained as a sewer and culverts beneath Brixton Road, south London, and seen through a drainage grate in the crypts under St. Luke's Church, West Norwood, south London. Course The Upper Norwood Recreation Ground, source of the main tributary of the Effra. The river was fed by several tributaries which met above Brixton. The main branch of the Effra rises near Harold Road in Upper Norwood Recreation Ground, and flows through West Norwood. Where Norwood High Street merges at the fountain with the A215 to form Norwood Road, it was joined by a small tributary from Knights Hill ward. A second branch rose south of Gipsy Hill and ran into West Dulwich via Croxted Road, after flowing from near the Westow House inn, Westow Hill. Beyond the Paxton pub opposite the end of Gipsy Hill its culvert captures water from Hamilton Road, forms the back garden line of Croxted Road and joins the other tributary at the South Circular Road, where it now forms the sewers of Croxted Road, Dulwich Road, Dalberg Road, Effra Road, Electric Lane, and Brixton Road.illustrations 1, 4 of the webpage of the Walbrook River page - a synopsis which cites the following books: Nicholas Barton, The Lost Rivers of London (1962) Anthony Clayton, Subterranean City (2000) Michael Harrison, London Beneath the Pavement (1961) Alfred Stanley Foord, Springs, Streams, and Spas of London.

(6th Edition, 2009) East along the watershed, springs rose in Dulwich Wood, flowing through Belair Park and beneath North Dulwich to Herne Hill. Still further to the east a tributary called the Ambrook rose from springs in Sydenham Hill Wood and Peckarmans Wood, flowing to Herne Hill through present-day Dulwich Park, where its heavily landscaped channel is visible. The longest and easternmost tributary ran from Eliot Bank and Horniman Park in Forest Hill down to Herne Hill. Rocque's map of 1746 called these confluences around Herne Hill railway station \\"Island Green\\".The Story of Norwood J.B. Wilson & H.A. Wilson Most of these tributaries are no longer visible above ground: an exception is the Ambrook, which still flows seasonally in Sydenham Hill Wood. The Effra flowed generally NNW until it reached its lower course, north of Brixton. At this point it turned northeast and then east, running through the grounds of Bermondsey Priory. It fed Lambeth and possibly Walworth Marshes, and may have joined the Earl's Sluice, which entered the Thames at Deptford Wharf. After diversion in the 13th century, it ran directly west from Kennington to join the Thames at Vauxhall.Southwark and Lambeth Archeological Society http://www.vauxhallandkennington.org.uk/lambeth_marsh.html Folklore Boundary marker for Camberwell Parish on the course of the Effra at Gipsy Hill, where the watercourse was rediscovered in the 1920s. A local story tells of a coffin found floating down the Thames in Victorian times, which was traced back to West Norwood Cemetery. Cemetery staff were puzzled to find that the plot the coffin had come from was undisturbed. Further investigation revealed that the ground beneath the grave had subsided, and the entire coffin had fallen into the underground Effra river, floating downstream to Vauxhall and entering the Thames. The song ‚ÄúDown in the Effra‚Äù by British folk band The Effras was written about this account. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQn8VLCmJ4I Flooding Although little more than a stream in the south, until 1935 the culverted watercourse flooded during heavy rains every decade or so; an inscription on a white stone tablet high up the side of a building in Elder Road, West Norwood reads: \\"FLOOD LEVEL 17th July 1890\\". After a three-hour-long storm on Sunday 14 June 1914 the sewer overflowed again and flooded houses along its path from Elder Road to Chestnut Road, and locals were forced to evacuate their homes for several days. Further floods in the 1920s prompted works to enlarge the sewer. This was sufficient until a small part of the local area was flooded again during a powerful downpour on 20 July 2007. The Unearthing the Effra Campaign In 1992 a project by the London arts group Platform sparked a local campaign to dig up the river. The Unearthing the Effra project was based around a mock Effra Redevelopment Agency, which included a public office. The project gained publicity in local newspapers and radio stations before the journalists noticed that the group had scattered, the whole thing being a stunt carried out in the name of art.

Available data show, for example, that: *Pigeons have the capacity to share attention between different dimensions of a stimulus, but (like humans and other animals) their performance with multiple dimensions is worse than with a single stimulus dimension. *Pigeons can be taught relatively complex actions and response sequences, and can learn to make responses in different sequences. *Pigeons readily learn to respond in the presence of one simple stimulus and withhold responding in the presence of a different stimulus, or to make different responses in the presence of different stimuli. *Pigeons can discriminate between other individual pigeons, and can use the behaviour of another individual as a cue to tell them what response to make. *Pigeons readily learn to make discriminative responses to different categories of stimuli, defined either by arbitrary rules (e.g. green triangles) or by human concepts (e.g. pictures of human beings). *Pigeons do less well with categories defined by abstract logical relationships, e.g. \\"symmetrical\\" or \\"same\\", though some experimenters have successfully trained pigeons to discriminate such categories. *Pigeons seem to require more information than humans for constructing a three-dimensional image from a plane representation. *Pigeons seem to have difficulty in dealing with problems involving classes of classes. Thus they do not do very well with the isolation of a relationship among variables, as against a representation of a set of exemplars. *Pigeons can remember large numbers of individual images for a long time, e.g. hundreds of images for periods of several years. All these are capacities that are likely to be found in most mammal and bird species. In addition pigeons have unusual, perhaps unique, abilities to learn routes back to their home from long distances. This homing behaviour is different from that of birds that learn migration routes, which usually occurs over a fixed route at fixed times of the year, whereas homing is more flexible; however similar mechanisms may be involved. Pigeons showed mirror-related behaviours during the mirror test.Epstein, Lanza, & Skinner (1981) R. Epstein, R.P. Lanza and B.F. Skinner, ‚ÄúSelf-awareness‚Äù in the pigeon, Science 212 695-696 Discrimination abilities of pigeons In a famous article in 1995, Watanabe, Sakamoto and Wakita described an experiment which showed that pigeons can be trained to discriminate between paintings by Picasso and by Monet. The birds were first trained on a limited set of paintings: when the shown painting was a Picasso, the pigeon was able to obtain food by repeated pecking; when it was a Monet, pecking had no effect. After a while, the pigeons would only peck when shown Picasso paintings. They were then able to generalize, and correctly discriminate between paintings of the two painters not previously shown, and even between cubist and impressionist paintings (cubism and impressionism being the two stylistic schools Picasso and Monet belong to). When the Monet paintings were shown upside down, the pigeons were not able to properly categorize anymore; showing the cubist works upside down did not have such an effect. In 1995, the authors won the humorous Ig Nobel Prize in psychology for this work. In a later paper, Watanabe showed that if pigeons and human college students undergo the same training, their performance in distinguishing between Van Gogh and Chagall paintings is comparable. The chamber used to train and test pigeons' ability to classify images. Adapted from Similar experiments had shown earlier that pigeons can be trained to distinguish between photos showing human beings and those that do not, and between photos showing trees and those that do not, among many other examples. In all these cases, discrimination is quite easy for humans, even though the classes are so complex that no simple distinguishing algorithm or rule can be specified. It has therefore been argued that pigeons are able to form \\"concepts\\" or \\"categories\\" similar to humans, but that interpretation is controversial. Nevertheless, the experiments remain important and often cited examples in cognitive science. In a 2015 paper published by Levenson et al. it was shown that rock dove pigeons (Columba livia), which share many visual system properties with humans, can serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented. The birds were tested on their ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology images and could even apply their learnings to previously unseen images. However when faced with a more challenging task, they reverted to image memorisation and thus showed little generalisation to novel examples.

He was an active researcher in animal learning in the Skinnerian tradition. Herrnstein was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology until his death, and previously chaired the Harvard Department of Psychology for five years. With political scientist Charles Murray, he co-wrote The Bell Curve, a controversial 1994 book on human intelligence. He was one of the founders of the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior. Early life and education Richard Herrnstein was born on 20 May 1930, in New York City, to a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants; the son of Flora Irene (n√©e Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter. He was educated at the High School of Music & Art and the City College of New York, receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University, with a thesis titled Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement. Before joining the Harvard faculty, he worked for three years in the United States Army. Research and work His major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the matching law, the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and mathematical psychology. He also developed melioration theory with William Vaughan, Jr. Herrnstein was considered a \\"star pupil\\" of B. F. Skinner while working for his PhD at Harvard. He worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab that he ran until his death. His research greatly contributed to the field of cognitive psychology. In 1965, and with Edwin Boring, Herrnstein wrote A Source Book in the History of Psychology. Herrnstein was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He was the chairman of the Harvard Department of Psychology from 1967 to 1971. He also acted as the editor of the Psychological Bulletin from 1975 to 1981. In 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Herrnstein's research focused first on natural concepts and human intelligence in the 1970s, and became prominent with the publication of his and Charles Murray's controversial best-selling book, The Bell Curve.  Matching law  Perhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as :\\\\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} = \\\\frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_2}, where R1 and R2 are rates of response for two alternative responses, and r1 and r2 are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice. Personal life Herrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, in May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, in November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James. Herrnstein died of lung cancer shortly before the book Bell Curve was released.

Life He was the son of Sir Christopher Hatton of Barking, Essex and Alice Fanshawe, daughter of Thomas Fanshawe; and was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge. He trained for the law at Gray's Inn. He was a noted antiquarian and compiled, together with William Dugdale and others, the Book of Seals, a volume of 529 medieval charters, of which 240 are reproduced in facsimiles drawn by a highly talented draftsman. Sir Christopher Hatton's Book of Seals has been edited by Lewis C. Loyd and Doris Mary Stenton (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1950). Hatton entered Parliament as MP for Peterborough in 1625, though legally too young to sit, and Clitheroe in that of 1626. On reaching the age of 21 in 1626, he was created a Knight of the Bath, as had been his father before him. He was elected a member of the Long Parliament in 1640 for both Higham Ferrers and Castle Rising, choosing to sit for the former where he was High Steward; he was one of the few candidates supported by Queen Henrietta Maria to secure election. During the Civil War, Hatton was a partisan of Charles I. In 1643 he was created Baron Hatton of Kirby; and, acting as comptroller of the royal household, he represented the king during the negotiations at Uxbridge in 1645. Later he lived for some years in France, and after the Restoration was made a privy counsellor and governor of Guernsey. In 1663 he became a founding Fellow of the Royal Society. He died at Kirby, Northamptonshire on 4 July 1670, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Griffin conducted preliminary tests during the summer of 1939 when he was a research fellow at the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station in Rensselaerville, New York. He set up a minimal bat flight facility in a 9-by-7 square-foot room in a barn and then measured the ability of bats to avoid obstacles by having them fly through a barrier of metal wires suspended from a ceiling. The remaining work was done at Harvard's Physical Laboratories. Using sound capture technology that had been developed by physicist G. W. Pierce, Galambos and Pierce were able to determine that bats generate and hear sounds an octave higher than can be heard by humans and other animals. Experiments they conducted used methods developed by Hallowell Davis to monitor the brains of bats and their hearing responses as they navigated their way past wires suspended from a laboratory ceiling. They showed how bats used echolocation to accurately avoid obstacles, which they were unable to do if their mouths or ears were kept shut.Martin, Douglas. \\"Robert Galambos, Neuroscientist Who Showed How Bats Navigate, Dies at 96\\", The New York Times, July 15, 2010. Accessed July 16, 2010. Griffin coined the term \\"echolocation\\" in 1944 to describe the phenomenon, which many physiologists of the day could not believe was possible. During World War II, Griffin worked for National Defense Research Committee where he supported the approval of the bat bomb. At a time when animal thinking was a topic deemed unfit for serious research, Griffin became a pioneer in the field of cognitive ethology, starting research in 1978 that studied how animals think. His observations of the sophisticated abilities of animals to gather food and interact with their environment and each other led him to conclude that animals were conscious, thinking beings, not the mere automatons that had been postulated. In its obituary, The New York Times credited Griffin as \\"the only reason that animal thinking was given consideration at all\\". While critics argue that cognitive ethology is anthropomorphic and subjective, those in the field have studied the ways that animals form concepts and mental states based on their interactions with their environment, showing how animals base their actions and anticipate the responses of other sentient beings. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. In 1958 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Griffin was the Director of the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, in the 1960s, which was formed as a collaboration between Rockefeller University and the New York Zoological Society (now Wildlife Conservation Society). A resident of Lexington, Massachusetts since his 1986 departure from Rockefeller University, Griffin died at his home there at age 88 on November 7, 2003. He was survived by two daughters and a son.

The National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (NKOJ) was its original executive body. Throughout its existence it was governed by Marshal Josip Broz Tito as prime minister. It was recognized by the Allies at the Tehran Conference, along with the AVNOJ as its deliberative body. The Yugoslav government-in-exile of King Peter II in London, partly due to pressure from the United Kingdom,Walter R. Roberts. Tito, Mihailoviƒá, and the allies, 1941-1945. Duke University Press, 1987. Pp. 288. recognized the AVNOJ government with the Treaty of Vis, signed on 16 June 1944 between the prime minister of the government-in-exile, Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá, and Tito. With the Treaty of Vis, the government-in-exile and the NKOJ agreed to merge into a provisional government as soon as possible. The form of the new government was agreed upon in a second ≈†uba≈°iƒá‚ÄìTito agreement signed on 1 November 1944 in the recently liberated Yugoslav capital of Belgrade. DF Yugoslavia became one of the founding members of the United Nations upon the signing of the United Nations Charter in October 1945. The state was formed to unite the Yugoslav resistance movement to the occupation of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers. The agreement left the issue of whether the state would be a monarchy or a republic intentionally undecided until after the war had ended so the position of head of state was vacant. After the merger of the governments, the state was reformed as a one-party Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia with Josip Broz Tito as Prime Minister and Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá as minister of foreign affairs. History The Second Session of the AVNOJ, held in Jajce in November 1943, opened with a declaration that read in part: #That the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia be constituted as the supreme legislative and executive representative body of Yugoslavia as the supreme representative of the sovereignty of the peoples and of the State of Yugoslavia as a whole, and that a National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia be established as an organ with all of the features of a national government, through which the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia will realize its executive function. #That the traitorous \\"government\\" in exile be deprived of all rights as the legal government of Yugoslavia, particularly of the right to represent the peoples of Yugoslavia anywhere or before anyone. #That all international treaties and obligations concluded abroad in the name of Yugoslavia by the \\"government\\" in exile be reviewed with a view to their invalidation or renewal or approval, and that all international treaties and obligations which the so-called \\"government\\" in exile may eventually conclude abroad in the future receive no recognition. #That Yugoslavia be established on a democratic federal principle as a state of equal peoples.Michael Boro Petrovich, \\"The Central Government of Yugoslavia\\", Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 62, No. 4 (1947), pp. 504‚Äì30. The AVNOJ then issued six decrees and the Presidium of the AVNOJ, which continued its functions when it was not in session, followed with four decisions. Together these comprised the constitution of the new state taking shape in Yugoslavia. On 30 November the Presidium gave Tito the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia and appointed him president of the government (or acting prime minister) and Minister of National Defence. Three vice presidents and thirteen other ministers were appointed to the NKOJ. The name \\"Democratic Federative Yugoslavia\\" was officially adopted on 17 February 1944. On the same day they adopted the five-torch emblem of Yugoslavia.Marko Attila Hoare, The Bosnian Muslims in the Second World War: A History (Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 200. After the deposition of King Peter II, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was proclaimed on 29 November 1945.  Government  Its legislature, after November 1944, was the Provisional Assembly.Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, Kosta ƒåavo≈°ki. Party pluralism or monism: social movements and the political system in Yugoslavia, 1944-1949. East European Monographs, 1985. Pp. 22. The Tito-Subasic agreement of 1944 declared that the state was a pluralist democracy that guaranteed: democratic liberties; personal freedom; freedom of speech, assembly, and religion; and a free press.Sabrina P. Ramet. The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918-2005. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: Indiana University Press. Pp. 167-168. However by January 1945 Tito had shifted the emphasis of his government away from emphasis on pluralist democracy, claiming that though he accepted democracy, he claimed there was no \\"need\\" for multiple parties, as he claimed that multiple parties were unnecessarily divisive in the midst of Yugoslavia's war effort and that the People's Front represented all the Yugoslav people. The People's Front coalition, headed by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and its general secretary Marshal Josip Broz Tito, was a major movement within the government. Other political movements that joined the government included the \\"Napred\\" movement represented by Milivoje Markoviƒá. Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was ruled by Temporary Government consisting mostly of Unitary National Liberation Front members and small number of other political parties from former Kingdom of Yugoslavia. President of the Government was Josip Broz Tito. Communists held 22 minister positions, including Finances, Internal Affairs, Justice, Transport and others. Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá, from Croatian Peasant Party and former ban of Croatian Banovina, was minister of Foreign Affairs, while Milan Grol, from Democratic Party, was Deputy Prime Minister.

Although it is the northernmost settlement in the council area of North Ayrshire it is contiguous with Wemyss Bay, which is in Inverclyde. The dividing line is the Kelly Burn, which flows into the Firth of Clyde just south of the Rothesay ferry terminal. Despite their proximity, the two villages have historically been divided, Skelmorlie in Ayrshire and Wemyss Bay in Renfrewshire. Skelmorlie itself is divided into two sections, Lower and Upper Skelmorlie. There is one primary school in the village, with secondary age pupils going to Largs Academy in North Ayrshire. In common with this part of the Clyde foreshore the rich red sandstone is a prominent feature of the landscape and housing in Skelmorlie. Early Skelmorlie Nestled on a plateau and situated 30-60m above the sea- level. Overlooking the four-mile wide Firth of Clyde to the beginning of the Scottish Highlands. The outstanding panoramic view from the area stretches from Arran and the \\"sleeping warrior\\" in the south west to the mountains either side of Loch Long to the North. First settled upon centuries ago by a group who left nothing other than an eighty ft long and five ft wide circle- segment on a partially man-made mound. The arrowhead shaped \\"segment\\" runs in a line from Scandinavia to the southern end of the isle of bute and beyond. It is known that \\"a significant population\\" lived around the area behind the present-day Manor Park Hotel in the 9th to 11th century and evidence supports the theory that an early Celtic church existed there before the arrival of the Cluniac Monks (who formed Paisley Abbey in 1163) and the foundation of the Roman Church. The land on which the modern day village now stands was passed from King Malcolm III to the Cunninghames and subsequently acquired by Sir Alexander de Montgomerie of Ardrossan on 25 March 1453 when his sister Anne married Sir Robert Cunninghame of Kilmaurs. The Montgomeries were Normans, descended from William the Conqueror's great grandmother. There were thirteen Montgomeries of Skelmorlie, the line was founded in 1461 by George Montgomerie, 2nd son of the first lord Montgomerie. The earliest known record of a \\"building\\" in the village is a building in the shape of a simple Keep which was built around 1502 on the site of what is now Skelmorlie Castle. This Keep was in the corner of the castle nearest Stirrats Farm. There were six baronets (a holder of a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown titled Sir but never entitled to sit in Lords) starting with Sir Robert Montgomerie in 1628 (knighted by James VI and who attended his own funeral and wept with the mourners in 1651) and ending with Sir Hugh Montgomerie who was very active in the political affairs of Glasgow being both Provost and MP for Glasgow, he was also a commissioner of the Treaty of the Union. Sir Hugh's nephew Robert had an elder daughter called Lilias whose marriage united the estate to the senior branch of the Family of Eglinton. The Cunninghames held the northern part of Skelmorlie for a while before passing it to the Montgomeries, the split was the burn at the Meigle. The Southern half was further split into two - nearest the south was Blackhouse (on or near to the site of the Manor Park Hotel) and nearest the north was Thirdpart, Barr, Moat and Auchengarth. The area of Knock entered into the possession of John, 1st Montgomerie of Blackhouse when his son Patrick married a Frazer of Knock. A feu charter in favour of \\"Patrick Montgomerie of Blackhous\\" can still be seen in the Manor Park Hotel. Patrick was succeeded by Hugh Montgomerie and then by John Montgomerie. John was a lieutenant Colonel in the Covenanters who was killed fighting Cromwell at Dunbar, his heir, also Patrick sold the estate to the Bannatynes of Kelly in 1633 and was the last of the Montgomeries of Blackhouse. The estate stayed part of the Kelly estate until the 1800s When Kelly Castle was burnt in 1740 the Bannatynes moved into Blackhouse which they had owned for a century. They sold it in 1780 and bought it back in 1795 after Kelly was sold. The 18th Century saw the end of feudal society (where peasants worked the land and contributed work to their land'lords') and the growth of industry. Communities were beginning to form at Finnock (Inverkip), Kellybridge and Skelmorlie (Meigle, North AyrshireMeigle). Simultaneously, some of this population was moving and accumulating in Largs. Most significantly, the 18th century saw the rise in the importance of the River Clyde and the increase in trade that it brought. The original road from Greenock went up Station Hill, up Skelmorlie Castle Road, down past the Castle, veered left (never reaching where the main road is now) then back up through Meigle to Largs. It was close to this road on the high ground that all the habitation existed. The area between the Kelly Burn and the track from Innes Park Road to Skelmorlie Community Centre was renamed Oakfield. That's the extremely short version. The highlights of the rest can be seen in the Chronology of local events. History The Skelmorlie Aisle in Largs. Skelmorlie's history is recorded as far back as the fifteenth century. Skelmorlie Castle, south of the village, is a tower house built on the site of an older structure in 1502. Much altered and added to since, it is an ancient seat of the Clan Montgomery (a notable burial tomb of the family can be seen at Skelmorlie Aisle in Largs). During the nineteenth century the village was once home to many Glasgow tea barons. On the cliff above the shore a large hydropathic institution once stood, with access from the main road via a lift whose shaft was hewn out of the rock face. The building later operated as a hotel, but was demolished in the 1990s. To the south of Skelmorlie is the serpent mound, a prehistoric, perhaps druidic, site apparently carved either deliberately for religious uses or by nature then reused due to its natural shape. On Saturday 18 April 1925, an embankment on the reservoir which belonged to the Eglinton Estate and provided the main water supply for the whole village gave way, releasing millions of gallons of water down through the village. After 10 minutes many homes, streets and gardens were shattered and five people, four of them children, lay dead. The composer and arranger Brian Fahey lived in Skelmorlie from 1972. Nowadays Skelmorlie has a population of 1880 residents. In the early part of the 20th century the Royal Navy used a measured nautical mile in the Firth of Clyde off Skelmorlie, known as the 'Skelmorlie Mile' as the range for speed trials of new warships.

Pribram (; ; February 25, 1919 ‚Äì January 19, 2015) was a professor at Georgetown University, in the United States, an emeritus professor of psychology and psychiatry at Stanford University and distinguished professor at Radford University. Board-certified as a neurosurgeon, Pribram did pioneering work on the definition of the limbic system, the relationship of the frontal cortex to the limbic system, the sensory-specific \\"association\\" cortex of the parietal and temporal lobes, and the classical motor cortex of the human brain. He worked with Karl Lashley at the Yerkes Primate Center of which he was to become director later. He was professor at Yale University for ten years and at Stanford University for thirty years. To the general public, Pribram is best known for his development of the holonomic brain model of cognitive function and his contribution to ongoing neurological research into memory, emotion, motivation and consciousness. He was married to American author Katherine Neville.  Holonomic model  Pribram's holonomic model of brain processing is described in his 1991 Brain and Perception, which contains the extension of his work with David Bohm. It states that, in addition to the circuitry accomplished by the large fiber tracts in the brain, processing also occurs in webs of fine fiber branches (for instance, dendrites) that form webs, as well as in the dynamic electrical fields that surround these dendritic \\"trees\\". In addition, the processing occurring around these dendritic trees can influence that occurring in those trees of nearby neurons whose dendrites are entangled but not in direct contact. In this way, processing in the brain can occur in a non-localized manner. This type of processing is properly described by Dennis Gabor, the inventor of hologram, as quanta of information he called a \\"holon\\", an energy-based concept of information. These wavelets are used in quantum holography, the basis of MRI, PET scans and other image processing procedures . Gabor wavelets are windowed Fourier transforms that convert complex spatial (and temporal) patterns into component waves whose amplitudes at their intersections become reinforced or diminished . Fourier processes are the basis of holography. Holograms can correlate and store a huge amount of information - and have the advantage that the inverse transform returns the results of correlation into the spatial and temporal patterns that guide us in navigating our universe. David Bohm had suggested that were we to view the cosmos without the lenses that outfit our telescopes, the universe would appear to us as a hologram. Pribram extended this insight by noting that were we deprived of the lenses of our eyes and the lens-like processes of our other sensory receptors, we would be immersed in holographic experiences.  Other contributions  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Pribram's neurobehavioral experiments established the composition of the limbic system and the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex. Pribram also discovered the sensory specific systems of the association cortex, and showed that these systems operate to organize the choices we make among sensory stimuli, not the sensing of the stimuli themselves. His account of how his discoveries were made is in his book The Form Within which was published in 2013. It includes stories of his encounters with leading scientists and scholars of the day, and amusing stories like how he lost part of a finger when his hand was slammed down by the chimpanzee Washoe at the University of Oklahoma. In 1999, he was the inaugural winner of the Dagmar and V√°clav Havel Award for uniting the sciences and the humanities. He died in 2015 in Virginia, aged 95.

He is the lead organizer of the Science of Consciousness conference. Career Hameroff received his BS degree from the University of Pittsburgh and his MD degree from Hahnemann University Hospital, where he studied before it became part of the Drexel University College of Medicine. He took an internship at the Tucson Medical Center in 1973. From 1975 onwards, he has spent the whole of his career at the University of Arizona, becoming professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Psychology and director for the Center for Consciousness Studies, both in 1999, and finally Emeritus professor for Anesthesiology and Psychology in 2003. Hypotheses At the very beginning of Hameroff's career, while he was at Hahnemann, cancer-related research work piqued his interest in the part played by microtubules in cell division, and led him to speculate that they were controlled by some form of computing. It also suggested to him that part of the solution of the problem of consciousness might lie in understanding the operations of microtubules in brain cells, operations at the molecular and supramolecular level. Hameroff's first book Ultimate Computing (1987) argues that microtubes allow for computation sufficient to explain consciousness.Hameroff, Stuart (1987), Ultimate Computing, Elsevier The main substance of this book dealt with the scope for information processing in biological tissue and especially in microtubules and other parts of the cytoskeleton. Hameroff argued that these subneuronal cytoskeleton components could be the basic units of processing rather than the neurons themselves. The book was primarily concerned with information processing, with consciousness a secondary consideration. Separately from Hameroff, the English mathematical physicist Roger Penrose had published his first book on consciousness, The Emperor's New Mind, in 1989.Penrose, Roger (1989) The Emperor's New Mind Oxford University Press On the basis of G√∂del's incompleteness theorems, he argued that the brain could perform functions that no computer or system of algorithms could. From this it could follow that consciousness itself might be fundamentally non-algorithmic, and incapable of being modeled as a classical Turing machine type of computer. This ran counter to the belief that it is explainable mechanistically, which remains the prevailing view among neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers. Penrose saw the principles of quantum theory as providing an alternative process through which consciousness could arise. He further argued that this non-algorithmic process in the brain required a new form of the quantum wave reduction, later given the name objective reduction (OR), which could link the brain to the fundamental spacetime geometry. Hameroff was inspired by Penrose's book to contact Penrose regarding his own theories about the mechanism of anesthesia, and how it specifically targets consciousness via action on neural microtubules. The two met in 1992, and Hameroff suggested that the microtubules were a good candidate site for a quantum mechanism in the brain. Penrose was interested in the mathematical features of the microtubule lattice, and over the next two years the two collaborated in formulating the orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) model of consciousness. Following this collaboration, Penrose published his second consciousness book, Shadows of the Mind (1994).Penrose, Roger (1994) Shadows of the Mind Oxford University Press Over the years since 1994, Hameroff has been active in promoting the Orch-OR model of consciousness through his web site and lectures. Criticism Hameroff and Penrose's model has been met with skepticism from many disciplines. Rick Grush and Patricia Churchland, argued that \\"physiological evidence indicates that consciousness does not directly depend on microtubule properties in any case\\". (also see article at IngentaConnect) In 2000, physicist Max Tegmark calculated that quantum states in microtubules would survive for only 10‚àí13 seconds, too brief to be of any significance for neural processes. Hameroff and the physicists Scott Hagan and Jack Tuszynski replied to Tegmark arguing that microtubules could be shielded against the environment of the brain and that Tegmark had used his own criteria for the reduction of the wavefunction, and did not use Penrose's OR, which is the basic assumption behind the whole theory. Christof Koch and Klaus Hepp also agreed that quantum coherence does not play, or does not need to play any major role in neurophysiology. Koch and Hepp concluded that \`\`The empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the ‚Äòfar-out‚Äô to the mere ‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô. Toward a Science of Consciousness Hameroff was the lead organizer of the first Tucson Toward a Science of Consciousness meeting in 1994 that brought together approximately 300 people interested in consciousness studies (e.g., David Chalmers, Christof Koch, Bernard Baars, Roger Penrose, Benjamin Libet). Hameroff remains co-organizer of this influential annual conference (now simply Science of Consciousness). The first conference is widely regarded as a landmark event within the field of consciousness studies, and by bringing researchers from various disciplines together led to various useful synergies, resulting indirectly, for instance, in the formation of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and more directly in the creation of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, of which Hameroff is now the director. The Center for Consciousness Studies hosts meetings on the study of consciousness every two years, as well as sponsoring seminars on consciousness theory. The conference was described by the Chronicle of Higher Education as \\"the Stuart Show\\", and that its \\"anything goes\\" atmosphere is damaging the credibility of the field. In 2006, Hameroff participated in the first Beyond Belief conference, where his theories were sharply criticized by Lawrence Krauss, among others. Film Hameroff appeared as himself in the documentary film What t–Ωe ‚ôØ$*! Do œâŒ£ (k)œÄow!? (2004). He serves as producer, writer and scientific advisor to an independent feature film called Mindville. Mindville is a feature-length motion picture that combines live action with animation and effects to present a journey into the mysteries of human consciousness.

He was also a patron of the arts and a poet. His mother, Mary Sidney n√©e Dudley, was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth I and a sister of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, an advisor and favourite of the Queen. Career He was educated at Shrewsbury and Christ Church, Oxford, afterwards travelling on the Continent for some years between 1578 and 1583.This article incorporates text from R.J. McNeill, 'Leicester, Robert Sidney, Earl of (1563-1626)' in Encyclopedia Britannica (1911), Vol XVI, p. 392. In 1585 he was elected member of parliament for Glamorganshire; and in the same year he went with his elder brother, Sir Philip Sidney to the Netherlands, where he served in the war against Spain under Robert Dudley. He was present at the Battle of Zutphen where Sir Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, and remained with his brother. After visiting Scotland on a diplomatic mission in 1588, and France on a similar errand in 1593, he returned to the Netherlands in 1606, where he rendered distinguished service in the war for the next two years. He had been appointed governor of the cautionary town of Flushing in 1588, and he spent much time there. In 1595 he sent his business manager Rowland Whyte to court to lobby for resources for Flushing, and to send him information about events at court including the latest political gossip. Whyte's letters provide a major resource for historians of the period. Whyte himself regularly complains about the indecipherable handwriting of his employer's replies.Lisle C.

In May 1618 he wrote to Sir Thomas Lake, the king's secretary with news of the queen declaration about efforts to reduce household expenses. She had told him that \\"while she lives she will obey the king in all things ... She therefore desires his majesty to take what order it shall please him, which shall please her also, for being wholly ignorant in household business, she will not any meddle with them\\".HNC 4th Report (De La Warr) (London, 1874), p. 282. In 1618 he became Earl of Leicester. The title had become extinct in 1588 on the death of his uncle Robert Dudley, part of whose property he had inherited.

Music and poetry Leicester was a man of taste and a patron of literature, whose cultured mode of life at his country seat, Penshurst Place, was celebrated in verse by Ben Jonson. Robert Sidney was a patron of musicians, as is proved by his being the dedicatee of Robert Jones‚Äôs First Booke of Songes and Ayres (1600) and A Musicall Banquet (1610) compiled by Robert Dowland, son of the composer John Dowland. Sidney had agreed to be godfather to John Dowland‚Äôs son, and A Musicall Banquet opens with a Galliard by John Dowland entitled Syr Robert Sidney his Galliard. Engraved portrait of Sidney by Simon de Passe, 1617 Though the brother of one of the most famous poets in the English language, it was not suspected that Robert Sidney had himself been a poet until the 1960s, when his working notebook emerged (in a 19th-century binding) through the dispersal of the Library of Warwick Castle. Subsequent research showed it had been acquired in 1848 after passing through a number of sales beginning with the dispersal of the library at Penshurst in the early 19th century. Sold again at Sotheby's and acquired by the British Library in 1975 (catalogued as Add MS 58435), the autograph is, as its first editor P. J. Croft pointed out, \\"the largest body of verse to have survived from the Elizabethan period in a text entirely set down by the poet himself\\". Dating apparently from the latter half of the 1590s when Robert Sidney was governor of Flushing, the collection comprises 66 sonnets, songs, pastorals, elegies and slighter pieces, apparently structured as a kind of reply to Philip Sidney‚Äôs Astrophel and Stella. They show Robert Sidney as an advocate of the Neo-platonic philosophy of love and adept at a great variety of verse forms. The fact that several of the poems are based on identifiable tunes confirms his interest in music. While he cannot be placed in the first rank of Elizabethan poets, his poems are by no means negligible and of the greatest interest for the working methods and intellectual interests of the period.

Origins Anthony St Leger was the eldest son of Ralph II St Leger of Ulcombe in Kent, by his wife Isabel (or Elizabeth) Haute. She was the daughter of Richard Haute (d. 8 April 1487) by his wife Elizabeth Tyrrell, widow of Sir Robert Darcy (c.1420 - 2 November 1469) of Maldon, Essex, and daughter of Sir Thomas Tyrrell (d. 28 March 1477) of Heron in the parish of East Horndon, Essex (son of John Tyrrell). Career He was educated abroad and at the University of Cambridge. He quickly gained the favour of King Henry VIII (1509‚Äì1547), and in 1537 was appointed president of a commission of enquiry into the condition of Ireland. In the course of this work, he obtained much useful knowledge of the country. In 1539, he was knighted and appointed Sheriff of Kent. =Lord Deputy of Ireland= On 7 July 1540, Sir Anthony was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and tasked with the repression of disorder. He moved against the MacMorrough-Kavanagh clan, who had long claimed the title of King of Leinster, permitting them to retain their lands only by accepting feudal tenure on the English model. By a similar policy, he exacted obedience from the O'Mores, O'Tooles and O'Conors in Leix and Offaly. Having conciliated the O'Briens in the west and the Earl of Desmond in the south, he obtained the passage of an act in the Irish Parliament in Dublin, which conferred the title of King of Ireland on King Henry VIII and his heirs. Conn O'Neill, who had remained sullenly hostile, was forced to submit. The policy was adopted and became known as \\"Surrender and regrant\\". St Leger's policy was generally one of moderation and conciliation, more so than Henry VIII wished. He recommended the head of the House of O'Brien, when he gave token of a submissive disposition, for the title of Earl of Thomond. O'Neill was created Earl of Tyrone. At St Leger's urging, the King in 1541 created six new Irish peerages. St Leger argued that the loyalty of the Anglo-Irish nobility could be better achieved \\"by small gifts and honest persuasion than by rigor\\", which seems to be an implicit criticism of the savage manner in which the Rebellion of Silken Thomas had been suppressed. St Leger's policy of conciliation seems to have been successful: in particular, the Plunkett family, who received the title of Baron Louth, became steadfast loyalists to the English Crown,National Library of Ireland Collection No.90 Louth Papers as did the Fitzpatrick family, who received the title of Baron Upper Ossory. Barnaby Fitzpatrick, 2nd Baron Upper Ossory grew up at Henry VIII's court, and he was a beloved childhood friend of Henry's son, Edward VI.Morris, Christoper The Tudors Fontana edition 1966 p.99 An administrative council was instituted in the province of Munster, and in 1544, a levy of Irish soldiers was raised for service in Henry VIII's wars. St Leger's personal influence was proved by an outbreak of disturbance when he visited England in 1544, and the prompt restoration of order upon his return some months later. St Leger retained his office under King Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553), and again effectively quelled attempts at rebellion by the O'Conors and O'Byrnes. From 1548 to 1550, Sir Anthony was in England and returned to Ireland charged with the duty of introducing the reformed liturgy into that island. His conciliatory methods led to his recall in the summer of 1551. After the accession of Queen Mary (1553‚Äì1558), he was again appointed Lord Deputy in October 1553, but a charge of keeping false accounts caused him to be recalled for the third time in 1556. He died while the accusation was still under investigation, by which time, in 1559, he had been elected Member of Parliament for Kent. Knight of the Garter Garter stall plate of Sir Anthony St Leger, KG, St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle In 1544, he was nominated by King Henry VIII as a Knight of the Garter. His Garter stall plate survives, affixed to his former stall in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. It is inscribed above with the motto: SOMIENE DE MOY DIEN (apparently garbled French, possibly for souviens de mon dieu, \\"I remember my God\\"?) and at the base in semi-illiterate French (i.e. with basic errors in gender): > Du noble et vailant chevalier mesier Antonye Sentleger Deputie pour la roy > en son royalme d'Ierlond et une de la estroiet chamber du roy NRE (n(ot)re?) > souverain SHR frere et compaignon de la tres noble Ordre de la Jarretiere > (\\"Of the noble and valiant knight Sir Anthony St Ledger, deputy for the king > in his kingdom of Ireland and one of the privy chamber of the king (our?) > sovereign SHR? brother and companion of the most noble Order of the > Garter\\"). The heraldry shows an escutcheon circumscribed by the Garter displaying the arms quarterly 1 & 4: Azure fretty argent (St Ledger); 2 & 3: Argent, three barnacles gules tied sable (Donet of Sileham, Rainham, Kent). Sir Anthony's great-grandfather Sir John St Leger (d.1442) of Ulcombe, married Margery Donet (or Donnet), daughter and heiress of James Donet (d.1409) of Sileham. His crest is shown as: A griffin statant (Crest of St Leger family, Viscount Doneraile: A griffin passant or (Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 365)) and his supporters: Two griffins wings elevated (supporters of St Leger family, Viscount Doneraile: Two griffins or wings elevated azure fretty argent (Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 365)). Character St Leger seems to have been a quarrelsome and unpopular man; certainly, he was on very bad terms with other leading figures in the Dublin administration, particularly John Alan, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and George Browne, Archbishop of Dublin. Following complaints by St Leger, Alan was removed from office and although he was later reinstated, the two men found it impossible to work together.O'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland London 1870 Archbishop Browne accused St. Leger of treasonable words, giving Alan as his source, but the charge came to nothing when Alan, surprisingly, refused to confirm the report.O'Flanagan Lives of the Chancellors When St Leger gave high military command to James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond, he was accused by allies of Alan's of deliberately doing this to endanger Ormond's life.Robert Dudley Edwards Ireland in the Age of the Tudors Croom Helm London 1977 p.58 Ormond's mysterious death from poisoning in London in 1546, with 16 of his household, when he went to dinner in the Ely Palace was, at the least, extremely convenient for St Leger, although there is no direct evidence that he was responsible for it (to complicate matters there was no proper investigation of the death, despite Ormond's wealth and social standing). Landholdings Leeds Castle in Kent, granted to Sir Anthony St Leger in 1552 As well as having inherited the paternal estate of Ulcombe, the St Leger family's seat from the 11th century, in 1552, he was granted possession of Leeds Castle in Kent, of which his grandfather Ralph I St Leger (d.1470) had been constable. Marriage and progeny St Leger married Agnes Warham, daughter of Sir Hugh Warham of Croydon, and niece of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury. By Agnes, he had at least five sons and two daughters, including: *William St Leger, who predeceased his father, albeit having left a son Sir Warham St Leger (d. 1600), whose own son was William St Leger (d. 1642), President of Munster. *Warham St Leger. *Anthony St Leger, Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1593; some sources however describe him as a nephew rather than a son of Sir Anthony.Ball, F.

Early life Waltheof was the second son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. His mother was Aelfflaed, daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bernicia, son of Uhtred, Earl of Northumbria. In 1054, Waltheof's brother, Osbearn, who was much older than he, was killed in battle, making Waltheof his father's heir. Siward himself died in 1055, and Waltheof being far too young to succeed as Earl of Northumbria, King Edward appointed Tostig Godwinson to the earldom. Waltheof was said to be devout and charitable and was probably educated for a monastic life. Around 1065, however, he became an earl, governing Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire. Following the Battle of Hastings he submitted to William and was allowed to keep his pre-Conquest title and possessions. He remained at William's court until 1068. First revolt When Sweyn II invaded Northern England in 1069, Waltheof and Edgar Aetheling joined the Danes and took part in the attack on York. He would again make a fresh submission to William after the departure of the invaders in 1070. He was restored to his earldom, and went on to marry William's niece, Judith of Lens. In 1072, he was appointed Earl of Northampton. The Domesday Book mentions Waltheof (\\"Walleff\\"): \\"'In Hallam (\\"Halun\\"), one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine carucates [~14 km¬≤] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an \\"Aula\\" [hall or court]. There may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the Countess Judith.\\" (Hallam, or Hallamshire, is now part of the city of Sheffield) In 1072, William expelled Gospatric from the earldom of Northumbria. Gospatric was Waltheof's cousin and had taken part in the attack on York with him, but like Waltheof, had been pardoned by William. Gospatric fled into exile and William appointed Waltheof as the new earl. Construction of Durham Castle began under Waltheof in 1072 after receiving orders to commence this project from William. The castle would be significantly expanded by Bishop William Walcher and his successors in later years. Waltheof had many enemies in the north. Amongst them were members of a family who had killed Waltheof's maternal great-grandfather, Uchtred the Bold, and his grandfather Ealdred. This was part of a long-running blood feud. In 1074, Waltheof moved against the family by sending his retainers to ambush them, succeeding in killing the two eldest of four brothers. Second revolt and death In 1075 Waltheof joined the Revolt of the Earls against William. His motives for taking part in the revolt are unclear, as is the depth of his involvement. However he repented, confessing his guilt first to Archbishop Lanfranc and then in person to William, who was at the time in Normandy. He returned to England with William but was arrested, brought twice before the king's court and sentenced to death. He spent almost a year in confinement before being beheaded on 31 May 1076 at St. Giles's Hill, near Winchester. He was said to have spent the months of his captivity in prayer and fasting. Many people believed in his innocence and were surprised when the execution was carried out. His body was initially thrown into a ditch, but was later retrieved and buried in the chapter house of Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire. Cult of martyrdom statue traditionally identified as Waltheof, at Croyland Abbey, west front of ruined nave, 4th tier In 1092, after a fire in the chapter house, the abbot had Waltheof's body moved to a prominent place in the abbey church. When the coffin was opened, it is reported that the corpse was found to be intact with the severed head re-joined to the trunk.Webb, Diana Pilgrimage in Medieval England Hambledon and London 2000 pp32-3 This was regarded as a miracle, and the abbey, which had a financial interest in the matter began to publicise it. As a result, pilgrims began to visit Waltheof's tomb. He was commemorated on 31 August. After a few years healing miracles were reputed to occur in the vicinity of Waltheof's tomb, often involving the restoration of the pilgrim's lost sight. They are described in the Miracula Sancti Waldevi. Waltheof's life thus became the subject of popular media, heroic but inaccurate accounts being preserved in the Vita et Passio Waldevi comitis,'Vita et Passio Waldevi Comitis' (with the Miracula), in F. Michel (ed.), Chroniques Anglo-Normandes, Vol. II (√âduard Fr√®re, Rouen 1836), pp. 99-142 (Internet Archive). a Middle English Waltheof saga, since lost, and the Anglo-Norman Waldef.A.J. Holden (ed.), Le Roman de Waldef, Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, Textes, 5 (Coligny-Gen√®ve, Fondation Martin Bodmer 1984). Family and children In 1070 Waltheof married Judith de Lens, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Lens and Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale. They had three children, the eldest of whom, Maud, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland, and another, Adelise (Alice of Nothumbria) married the Anglo-Norman noble Raoul III of Tosny.

Life Carte was born near Clifton upon Dunsmore (itself near Rugby) to Samuel Carte. He matriculated at University College, Oxford in 1698, and took his degree from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1702, and an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1706. He first became well known for his controversy with Dr Henry Chandler regarding the Irish massacre of 1641, during the English Civil War, in which he defended the late King Charles I. His attachment to the Stuarts also caused him to remain a non-juror. He was ordained around 1714, and in that year refused to take the Oath of Allegiance. On the discovery of the plot of Francis Atterbury, whose secretary he was, he was accused of high treason in 1722 and was forced to flee to France adopting the name of Philips. There he collected materials for an English edition of the works of Jacques August de Thou and Nicolas Rigault, which were purchased and published by Dr Mead. He was recalled to England in 1728 through the influence of Queen Caroline. Carte held the rectory in Yattendon during the later part of his life, working on part of his \\"General History of England\\" while living there. He was buried in the church at Yattendon.

He, however, continued to publish; and the 2nd volume appeared in 1750, the 3rd in 1752, the 4th in 1755. He collected a large quantity of historical papers during his life.
