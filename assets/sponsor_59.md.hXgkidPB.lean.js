By convention, and similarly to other jurisdictions with Westminster systems of government, the public sector is organised into the public service and public entities. The public sector is also collectively known as the machinery of government. In Victoria, the public sector is defined by the Public Administration Act 2004. The Victorian public service is composed of eight departments, the head of each being a secretary. Each department can consist of a number of portfolios, each of which is the direct responsibility of a minister, who collectively form the ministry. A number of other bodies perform specific roles within the public service. For example, the Victorian Public Sector Commission oversees and reports on the public sector as a whole; Administrative Offices established in relation to departments and undertake clearly defined tasks while reporting directly to the secretary and the responsible Minister; and various other bodies which are described in legislation as public service employers. Public entities are formed in various ways: they may be statutory authorities, formed by legislative instruments which define their role and purpose; state-owned enterprises with a commercial purpose; or other advisory bodies performing a public function. Public entities are granted varying degrees of autonomy but are ultimately responsible to the relevant minister. For that purpose, each is assigned to the portfolio of the department supporting the minister. Departments, therefore, are responsible for both the public service bodies and public entities which fall within their purview. Transfers of responsibility between public sector bodies, and the creation or abolition of these bodies, are known as machinery of government changes. The Public Administration Act provides the mechanisms by which such changes are made.

She is one of the pioneers of conceptual art in Azerbaijan. Shikhlinskaya's work explores current problems in the relationship between individual and society. In art projects curated by Sabina Shikhlinskaya, the social subject also has high priority.  Life and career  Sabina Shikhlinskaya was born April 26, 1962 in Baku, Azerbaijan, where she lives and works.

After graduating, she enrolled in the Mukhina Institute of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg where she continued her studies of monumental (large format) painting. However, Shikhlinskaya abandoned her diploma work in 1983 due to her disagreement with the normative and propagandistic Soviet style, returning to Baku to study easel painting at the Azerbaijan State University of Arts. In 1988, Sabina's diploma work on the theme of the pagan holiday \\"Novruz Bayram\\" (holiday of spring) ‚Äì with nude symbolic figures ‚Äì was never shown as it blatantly challenged Soviet ideology. However, Sabina continued to paint on the theme of Novruz and subsequently two of these were purchased by the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow as part of their modern art collection from Azerbaijan.Video \\"Dangerous Red\\" by Sabina Shikhlinskaya, 30th Council of Europe Art Exhibition The Desire for Freedom.

Later in the 1990s, Sabina switched from painting to drawing, where she wove literary texts into graphic forms and images. In parallel, she began to experiment with land art, installation and video. After her first attempt in 1996, where Sabina Shikhlinskaya and a group of Azerbaijani artists installed a labyrinth in the gallery space, she fully transitioned from traditional painting to contemporary art. In 1999 Sabina curated and participated in a project on the theme of \\"Paradise Lost\\", in which participating artists collected found objects on the Absheron peninsula and created installations focused on the Baku's environmental decay. In 2000, as part of another land art project about fire worship, Sabina made seven doors from fire, emulating an ancient Zoroastrian temple.

In 1996, Shikhliskaya launched the \\"Labyrinth\\" project in Baku. This was the first contemporary art exhibition in Azerbaijan resulting from a month-long workshop followed by a group installation by Azerbaijani artists. Following the success of this project, the twelve participating artists, under the leadership of Shikhlinskaya, formed the Labyrinth Art Group. In 1999, Sabina Shikhlinskaya curated the first land art project in Azerbaijan with the artists from the Labyrinth Art Group. This land art workshop, symposium and exhibition was dedicated to the theme of \\"Paradise Lost\\" ‚Äì the artists‚Äô interpretation of the state of environment in Baku city and its surrounding. \\"Paradise Lost\\" was followed by the second symposium ‚Äì \\"Paradise Found\\" in 2000, where the same participants created installations in the nature of the mountain areas of Azerbaijan. In 2001, Shikhlinskaya organized the third consecutive land art project on the theme of \\"Fire\\" ‚Äì interpreting the ancient tradition of Zoroastrianism. For the next land art project in 2004 ‚Äì \\"Nargin Island\\", Sabina Shikhlinskaya curated an international group of artists together with the Labyrinth members that inhabited an abandoned military island. Through painting, sculpting and installation, the artists transformed the environment of the military debris into objects of their personal artistic interpretation. Press-conference at the opening of \\"Steps of Time\\" exhibition in Dresden Museum of Art, 2008 In 2005 within the framework of \\"Aluminum\\" ‚Äì Azerbaijan's second International Biennial of Contemporary Art, Sabina Shiklinskaya curated a public performance of the Labyrinth Art Group members, who painted and sculpted in the abandoned oil fields of Baku, thus transforming the nature of oil from its utilitarian purpose to the art medium. \\"USSR-remix\\" project presentation, Norway, Stavanger, 2010 In 2007, Sabina Shikhlinskaya was the curator of the Azerbaijan's 1st pavilion52ND INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF VISUAL ARTS 2007: LA BIENNALE DI VENEZIA at the 52nd Art Biennale in Venice. In 2008, Shikhlinskaya curated a group exhibition \\"USSR ‚Äì Remix\\" the artists‚Äô discussion on the topic of post-communist traces in the mentality of peoples and nations once living under the Soviet regime. Later that year, USSR ‚Äì Remix was exhibited in Dresden Museum of Art along with another group show curated by Shikhlinskaya ‚Äì \\"Steps of Time\\" ‚Äì a selection of art works by Azerbaijani artists of different generations, from Soviet (both social realists and non- conformist) to young contemporary artists. In 2009 Sabina Shikhlinskaya organized \\"Maiden Tower\\", the international forum of contemporary art on the theme of gender that took place in Baku, Azerbaijan. In 2010 she continued gender subject and curated international video art exhibition \\"Openly\\" shown in Istanbul, Antrepo, Sanat Limani in the frames of \\"Istanbul ‚Äì Capital of Culture of Europe\\". In 2010 Shikhlinskaya presented new version of \\"USSR- remix\\" international group exhibition project in Center for Contemporary Art in Baku, Azerbaijan and later in Tou Scene Art Centre, Stavanger, Norway. In 2011 she presented the project \\"USSR-remix\\" in the TRANSKAUKAZJA International Festival, Italian Passage, Warsaw, Poland. Between 1996 and 2005, alongside her curatorial activities, Sabina Shikhlinskaya undertook a number of educational art projects in various institutions. She founded a school of painting for children, taught art in European Lyceum in Baku and TISA, the International School of Azerbaijan. She also conducted art therapy courses for vulnerable children: war refugees, orphans and children with disabilities. In both her educational and curatorial projects, Sabina Shikhlinskaya partnered with such organizations as the Solomon Guggenheim Museum, UNDP, UNESCO, UNIFEM, Open Society Institute, Apollonia Art Exchanges, Azerbaijan Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Azerbaijan Ministry of Youth and Sports, Azerbaijan Center for Contemporary Arts, Azerbaijani Artists Union, Museum of Fine Art of Azerbaijan, as well as cultural representations of French, Italian, German, Norwegian, and Japanese embassy missions in Azerbaijan.

It is Konami's second fighting game released after their 1985 arcade-hit Yie Ar Kung-Fu. It is also the first fighting game with multiple playable characters with different move sets, as well as the first mecha-based fighting game. Gameplay The game is controlled with an 8-way joystick and three buttons: the attack button, the guard button, and the weapon selection button. There are six stages, each with different themes and environmental effects based on gravity. Some other features introduced in Galactic Warriors that were used in later fighting games include block damage, air-blocking, the ability to shoot/throw projectiles, the ability to execute multiple attacks while airborne, a modern health bar (as opposed to a health meter with notches like in Capcom's Mega Man series that made their debut two years later), the ability to switch between armed and unarmed and attacks of varying levels of strength. Another feature introduced at the time allows the player to choose one of three Mechas, each with their own movesets: Samson, Gaea and Poseidon. When one is selected, the player must use it to destroy other robots in each planet. Other than the playable characters, there are several non-playable characters and bosses with original designs and unique movesets. In the final battle, the player will face the same character he or she chose. After defeating the final opponent, the game goes back to the beginning and the player's chosen character and the opponents will have an extra weapon. Unlike in the single player modes of other fighting games, Galactic Warriors lacks continues and gives the player a number of lives similar to ones in some other genres from platform games to beat 'em ups. When the player loses all of his or her lives, the game is over and it returns to attract mode. In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at their life bars. At the start of the fight, both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken. Therefore, if a player's life bar is pink when/if time runs out, that player will lose. The BGM is often thrown in television programs and other types of media on the music side, and its soundtrack was included with its arranged versions in two albums: Konami GAME MUSIC VOL.2 and KONAMI GM HITS FACTORY I.

It is managed by the City of Cape Town's Environmental Resource Management Department.Nature reserves The Rietvlei Wetland Reserve forms part of the greater Table Bay Nature Reserve.  Background  Rietvlei is considered as the most important area for waterbirds in the region and is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. Official recognition of its importance to biodiversity by the South African government was first afforded in 1984, when it was established as a Nature Area. This was followed by its declaration as a Protected Natural Environment in 1989, and the establishment of the Rietvlei Wetland Reserve in 1993. The first formal management plan for the reserve was developed in 1994, and this has served to guide management activities to the present.  History  The most obvious and dramatic human-induced modification at Rietvlei was the dredging of the entire north-west section between 1974 and 1976. Seawater was pumped into the pans to facilitate the operation and a vast area was dredged to a depth of . The ecological consequences were profound and irreversible. A sizable portion of Rietvlei's shallow ephemeral pans was changed into a permanent deep-water lake, which resulted in a total change in ecological character for this portion of the system.  Features  = Visitor facilities = Rietvlei Wetland Reserve offers various user activities, including several types of water sport recreation, bird watching, picnic, fishing and outdoor environmental education opportunities. The Rietvlei Education Centre hosts a range of environmental education programmes and utilises the two bird hides and the short footpath for field excursions. The Milnerton Aquatic Club leases an area of land inside the nature reserve from where they promote windsurf, sail, power- and radio-controlled boating.Milnerton Aquatics Club : welcome The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) manages a rehabilitation facility at Rietvlei.Sanccob = Habitats = A range of natural and semi-natural habitats exist in this fluctuating wetland, which floods in winter and dries out in summer when the estuary mouth closes. These habitats include shallow marine waters, estuarine waters, sand/shingle shores, tidal mudflats, saltmarshes, coastal brackish saline lagoons, rivers, streams and creeks, permanent freshwater lakes and permanent and seasonal freshwater marshes and pools. = The Diep estuary = The Diep River flows through the Rietvlei wetland and the Milnerton Lagoon, which together have generally been considered to comprise the Diep estuary. If the contour above mean sea level is used as the estuary delineation, then the Diep estuary entirely encompasses the Rietvlei Wetland Reserve. The Diep River has its origins in the Riebeek Kasteel Mountains north-east of Malmesbury from where it flows for about south-west towards Cape Town before entering the sea at Milnerton, some north of the Port of Cape Town. It has one major tributary, the Mosselbank, which drains the northern slopes of the Durbanville Hills. Other tributaries include the Swart, Groen, Klein, and Riebeeck, with the Klapmuts being a tributary of the Mosselbank. The total size of the catchment is 1,495 km2 or 154,347 hectares.Peak Practice, 2008. Estuary Management Plan for the Diep Estuary, December 2008. C.A.P.E. Estuaries Programme report.  Biodiversity  = Birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals = A total of 173 species have been recorded at Rietvlei, of which 102 are waterbirds and 76 are present regularly. Breeding has been confirmed for 23 waterbird species and is suspected for a further 13 species. The high diversity of waterbirds is due to the wide range of wetland habitats present and the proximity of Rietvlei to the ocean, which allows both freshwater and coastal species to exploit the system. Fluctuating water-levels are intrinsic to Rietvlei's biological value. During peak floods, swimming birds of deep, open water abound. Birds of marshy habitats replace these as the water recedes, and waders exploiting shallow mudflats occur in great abundance just prior to the wetland drying up. Rietvlei has been ranked as the sixth most important coastal wetland in South Africa for waterbirds, and it supports an average of 5,550 birds in summer; during good years, however, numbers are boosted above 15,000. Phoenicopterus minor, a species of global conservation concern, occurs at the site, but not in globally significant numbers.BirdLife International (2010) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Rietvlei Wetland Reserve.

Most of these birds used to forage at Rietvlei and would contribute substantially to the large numbers of birds occurring here. The effects on this breeding area will probably result in fewer birds visiting the Rietvlei area. Other threats to the wetland include siltation, which results from erosion, and pollution and eutrophication from fertilizers, pesticides, sewage works, stormwater run-off and livestock manure. Petroleum factories and suburban areas on the margin of the system also pose problems. Vast areas of the mudflats and salt marsh have been smothered by thick mats of non-native grasses, notably Paspalum vaginatum, resulting in habitat loss for waders, the most diverse and abundant community of waterbirds at Rietvlei. Other non- native species, including stands of Acacia saligna, are being cleared from large areas around the margin of the wetland.

He is an alumnus of Eshihiru Secondary school but was not lucky enough to join a tertiary institution due to financial constraints. He thus had to travel to Nairobi where he worked as a matatu tout. The income he earned from this job was to meagre that it could not sustain his needs and that of his family. Daddy Owen has always confessed that he used to be a pick pocket in Downtown Nairobi and thus was until he was attacked by a mob and almost lynched. ‚ÄúIt all happened in a split second. All I remember was lying down surrounded by a huge crowd who beat me up mercilessly. One poked my eye using a sharp instrument. Meanwhile, I could hear the rest urging someone to bring a car tyre to burn me alive,‚Äù After spending a whole week in an eye hospital in Kikuyu, he decided to turn over a new leaf. He however remains with a scar on his left eye that he conceals with his pair of sunglasses Career Owen at the Groove Awards Owen started singing way back when he was still in high school but was not particularly able to hit the limelight because he lacked money to record his songs as he was from a humble background. He however credits his breakthrough to great support both financial, spiritual and emotional from his family, particularly his brother Rufftone and the late gospel artist Kaberere who he has constantly called his mentor. Daddy Owen released his first album, Haijalishi, in 2004. Philanthropy Daddy Owen is the founder of Malaika Awards which seeks to honour artistes with disabilities.

Biography  Kate Vrijmoet began formal art studies at Moore College of Art, Philadelphia, taking weekend classes while attending high school (1982‚Äì1983). She went on to study at the School of Visual and Performing Arts at Syracuse University, and was invited to teach there in 1994, earning her MFA in 1997. She studied painting with Evelina Brozgul at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2004 and with Richard Ryan at Boston University from 2005 to 2006.

Vrijmoet was one of 16 American artists whose work was included in the 5th Beijing International Art Biennale. Her painting, \\"Naked Snow Blower\\", a part of Vrijmoet's Accident's series, was exhibited in the National Museum of China beginning September 28, 2012. In 2014 she curated the Social Practice Art exhibit, \\"The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human,\\" in Seattle City Hall, a traveling exhibit aimed at ending the stigma and silence surrounding mental illness.

A student of anatomy since childhood, Vrijmoet has for three decades included life drawing in her daily practice. She is currently completing her Accident series and her Non-ordinary Reality series. In August, 2010, the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle published a 42-page catalog for her solo show, Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures.CoCA (2010), Kate Vrijmoet: Essential Gestures In 2011 Vrijmoet's work was featured in a South Seattle Community College showing, and during a solo show at the LANN Museum in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Her profile was featured in the inaugural issue of the Huffington Post Arts Section.Ming Holden (June 18, 2010) What Does Ecuador Have to Do with Seattle? Huffington Post Kate discuses her work in detail in an interview published by the science and culture digest 3 Quarks Daily.Elatia Harris (September 13th, 2010) 'Kate Vrijmoet: A Non-ordinary Painting Trajectory' In her exhibit book, The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human[14], she writes, \\"Art connects us. It tells us we're human, we're like one another, we feel the same emotions. My mission as a human being, and my job as an artist, is to use art to create deep connections among us. Those deep connections already exist, but sometimes convention rewards us for ignoring them. I contend that the greater rewards come from exploring them.\\". In 2011 Vrijmoet's installation piece \\"Mother May I‚Ä¶?\\" was exhibited at the Orange County Center on Contemporary Arts (OCCCA),in a show that was endorsed by Nicolas Bourriaud, who coined the term relational aesthetics, or Relational art. In 2012 this installation was featured in the largest artist-run, not for profit organization in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Artists Waterfront Coalition's (BWAC) juried show. \\"Mother May I‚Ä¶?,\\" ‚Äî an interactive audio installment designed to address our fundamental sense of belonging ‚Äî was awarded \\"Best Installation\\" by Charlotta Kotik, curator of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Vrijmoet's work has featured in New York City shows juried by curators of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Anne Strauss), the Guggenheim (Nat Trotman), and Museum of Modern Art (Paulina Pobocha). In 2013 she began curating a Social Practice Art exhibit aimed at ending the stigma and silence surrounding mental illness. The Incredible Intensity of Just Being Human has been exhibited at the Seattle Center, and Highline College. In 2014 she won prestigious grants through Artist Trust and Seattle Department of Neighborhoods to further fund this exhibit in Seattle City Hall where civic leaders Mayor Ed Murray, Randy Revelle, Brady Walkinshaw, and Tina Orwall spoke at the opening reception about mental illness. Vrijmoet's project was supported by Seattle Office of Arts and Culture, and Allied Arts Foundation. Also in 2013 she participated in SEAF with her social sculpture \\"Poor Impulse Control\\"- an example of relational art, social sculpture, or ironic participation. In this form the artist exploits the role of the viewer as the art object. The primary role of social sculpture is not one of beauty, but of intervention through discomfort. The audience has an interdependent relationship with the work. Of this social sculpture Vrijmoet writes, \\"The collapse of the emotional and physical boundaries inherent to the human experience is a recurrent theme in my work. [...] my work directly engages participants communally, even as it remains distinctly personal to each audience member. Although initiated by a single creator, audience participation is fundamental to making my work come to life.\\" In the catalog essay of her CoCA solo exhibit, \\"Essential Gestures\\", Elatia Harris writes of her work, \\"Any single image from the Accident series will freeze you where you stand. Motionlessly, you check yourself for parts and think, Oh, that's the thing, the thing that happened to me, even if no one sees it. The Water paintings, on the other hand, will dislocate you ‚Äì you are pulled, plunged and buoyed, seeing up and through and down.\\" Maine writer and art critic, Dan Kany, writes Vrijmoet's work takes a \\"supremely anti-modernist stance ‚Äì following the idea that Modernism doesn't privilege the artist/author over the viewer.\\" A show of her Accident Series Paintings was exhibited in 2013 at Columbia Basin College's Esvelt Gallery in Eastern Washington. In 2014 she published an article The Broader Economic Impact of Donating Your Art, that went viral on social media outlets and was viewed more than 2 million times across the globe.Kate Vrijmoet (March 2014)' Omphaloskepsis This article continues to inspire dialog surrounding fundraising in the arts.

Falling near Kibbutz Hafetz Haim, the aircraft suffered damages estimated at several million dollars. The Eitan fleet was subsequently grounded for several months until two investigative teams, one by the air force and another by Israel Aircraft Industries, submitted their findings. The aircraft was found to have gone down during flight testing of a navigational component fitted on one of its wings, which broke. After additional tests by IAI, the air force finally permitted the Eitan back into the air on September 6, 2012. Two months later the squadron took part in Operation Cast Lead. 210 Squadron and the Eitan have also been mentioned amid the talk of a possible Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear program. The UAV's high service ceiling, its ability to stay a loft for a considerable amount of time, and large payload and range, have made it especially suited for long-range and advanced reconnaissance and intelligence missions. The aircraft have also been linked to possible Israeli strikes against Iranian arms convoy in Sudan.

A female psyllid can lay up to 2000 eggs over the course of a four- to seven-week period. Eggs are laid on the margins of new leaf growth and are anchored by short stalks. They hatch after 7 to 14 days, and the first-instar nymphs start to feed on the underside of the leaves where they begin to form galls. The feeding of a large number of nymphs causes curling of the leaves, distortion of shoots, and even cessation of growth. The nymphs moult five times before becoming winged adults. The nymphal development stage lasts between 20 and 40 days depending on temperature.Catling, H. D. 1970.

Damage and control T. erytreae is one of only two vectors of the causative agents of citrus greening disease, the phloem-restricted, Gram- negative bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter spp. The Asian form, L. asiaticus, is heat tolerant and symptoms of the disease can develop at temperatures up to 35 ¬∞C. The African form, L. africanum, is heat sensitive and symptoms only develop when the temperature is in the range 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C.Garnier, M., S. Jagoueix-Eveillard, P. R. Cronje, G. F. LeRoux, and J. M.

Associated with T. erytreae in Zimbabwe are two primary parasitoids and a number of secondary and tertiary hyperparasitoids. One of the primary parasitoids, Terrastichus radiatus, remains external to the psyllid host, whereas the other, Psyllaephagus pulvinatus, is an internal parasitoid.

He studied composition at the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts in Berlin under Frank Michael Beyer (1971) and at the Musikhochschule Hannover under Alfred Koerppen (1972‚Äì77). In the course of his studies, Schmidt- Kowalski turned from the musical avant-garde and chose to write in a more traditional vein. Since the late 1970s he worked as a freelance composer, mainly writing commissioned works for soloists and events. His compositions have been performed in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney, Melbourne, Mexico City, and Yokohama, and have been recorded on the Naxos label. Schmidt- Kowalski latterly emerged as a conductor of his own works. Tonal language Schmidt-Kowalski's works are fully tonal, and their design and harmony is essentially derived from 19th-century practice, with emphasis on the melodic element. He saw the musical Romantic not as an era, but as transcending time, and thus did not consider his tonality and romanticism to be at all nostalgic. His output focused on chamber and orchestral music.

The term people of faith has been increasingly used in the twentieth and twenty-first century by religious adherents in Westernized countries who are critical of a perceived increase in public disenchantment or de-emphasis upon accommodation for religious adherents, although the term itself is used more as a catch-all term which is intentionally non-denominational or non-specific to any particular religious path. A person of faith is said to belong to a faith community or faith-based community. The term is also criticized by advocates of nontheistic positions for being inaccurate in its assumption of an underlying, unifying commonality between all religious observants - despite stark doctrinal differences and oppositional stances - simply for the purpose of reducing the influence of secular-minded individuals (similar to the term person of color as a catch-all descriptor of non-white people, or the Islamic description of people of the Book to describe the communities of adherents to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism).

This gang was notable for its longevity and skill in avoiding police detection.Capstick, J., Given in Evidence, (London, 1960), chapter 9.  History  The Forty Thieves operated from the Elephant and Castle area of London. They were allied to the Elephant and Castle Mob led by the McDonald brothers. They raided quality stores in the West End of London and ranged all over the country. The gang was also known to masquerade as housemaids for wealthy families before ransacking their homes, often using false references. They were in existence from at least 1873 to the 1950s with some indications that they may have been in existence since the late 18th century. During the early 20th century the gang was led by Alice Diamond, known variously as the Queen of the Forty Thieves and as Diamond Annie and as a friend of Maggie Hill, sister to gangster Billy Hill. Their heyday was in the interwar period when the gang raided on a large scale not only in the West End of London, but also other major shopping centres across the country. They also forced smaller gangs to pay tribute on what they had stolen and would punish criminals that did not obey their rules. The gang had its own set of rules and demanded loyalty from its members and others in the supply and distribution network. Alice Diamond ruled with absolute authority with the co-operation of Maggie Hill, Gertrude Scully, the Partridge sisters, and many others. Over seventy direct members of the gang operating in the 1920s and 1930s have been identified. Reports that said the gang collapsed when their leaders were jailed for the 1925 Battle of Lambeth are incorrect. The gang was still in existence after World War Two as new family members replaced old hands. They were often said to be able to meet equal numbers of men in battle and were admired by their male counterparts in the Elephant Gang for their organisation and expertise. One member of the gang, Lilian Goldstein (n√©e Kendall), was known to police as the Bobbed-Haired Bandit, the lover of Elephant Gang associate Ruby Sparks, and a driver on his smash and grab raids.  Methods  It is unclear how long the gang operated. The earliest mention of the gang in newspapers dates to 1873, but police records from London indicate that female shoplifters were active in the area since the late 18th century. The original gang members wore women's clothing which was modified to include hidden pockets. They could hide their loot in their coats, cummerbunds, muffs, skirts, bloomers, and hats. They raided the large stores of West End of London. Due to the prude-like attitudes of their era of activity, female customers were afforded privacy from the store staff, leaving female shoplifters, such as the Forty Elephants, with the opportunity to escape notice. The gang stole goods worth thousands of pounds. The female gang members earned enough money to financially support their male spouses. The spouses in question included both idle men who lounged at home, and inmates of the British prison system. The gang eventually became well-known to the area with the high-class shops which they typically targeted. Their mere presence could cause panic, eliminating the secrecy required for their activities. Their response to this challenge was to expand their activities from London to other British towns, where they were less known. They targeted rural areas and seaside towns. During the 20th century, the gang modernized their activities. They invested in fast cars (automobiles) to transport their loot, and to use as getaway vehicles which could \\"outrun the police\\". Loot was also transferred through the British railway system. The members used trains to travel to a town and deposited their empty suitcases at railway stations. During their return trip, the suitcases were filled with stolen goods. Besides shoplifting the gang developed sidelines, such as looting houses and blackmailing individuals. Gang members used false reference letters to get hired as maids and then robbed the houses of their employers. They also managed to seduce men into brief affairs, and then blackmailed them with threats of ruining the men's reputations. By the 1920s, the gang members started imitating the so-called bright young things group whose exploits appeared in the popular press. The gang members led an extravagant and decadent lifestyle, by imitating the exploits of the era's movie stars and flappers. Part of their earnings was used to finance party events and to \\"spend lavishly\\" at the clubs, pubs, and restaurants which the gang members frequented. The gang was particularly territorial of their turf. Other shoplifters who stole from shops on their turf were forced to pay the gang a percentage of their takings. If the intruders refused to pay, the gang arranged beatings and kidnappings of the offenders until the payment was received. While various gang members were arrested and convicted at times, their prison sentences tended to be short. They could be sentenced to either 12 months of penal labour or 3 years of prison incarceration. Once released, they returned to the gang. Several of the members remained with the gang for a relatively long time. A gang member known as Ada Wellman was initially arrested in 1921. She was still with the gang when arrested for another offence in 1939. While the gang members often stole clothing items, they typically did not wear the stolen clothes. Their loot was distributed to a network of fences, street market traders, and pawnbrokers. Part of the stolen clothing items were sold to clothing stores, which simply replaced the labels and modified their designs. Some of the fences associated with the gang were also arrested, but could not be convicted. Ada McDonald was arrested as a suspected fence in 1910. She used ledgers of suspect authenticity to convince the authorities that the goods in her possession were the products of legitimate financial transactions. Jane Durrell, another suspected fence, and her common-law-husband Jim Bullock were both placed on trial in 1911. It was a jury trial, and the jury decided that the police evidence against them was insufficient. They were acquitted of the charges and released.

It has a double summit: a northern top to the rear, the Hintere Goinger Halt (2,192 metres), and a higher, southern top in front, the Vordere Goinger Halt (2,242 metres). The name \\"Halt\\" means something like Alpine meadow and refers therefore to the peak over the meadow areas, that belong to the parish of Going (c.f. Ellmauer Halt).  Location  Hintere (right) and Vordere Goinger Halt (left) from the east from the Griesener Cirque The Goinger Halt climbs immediately east of the Ellmauer Tor from the cirque of the Steinerne Rinne and so lies in the central part of the Kaisergebirge. Opposite it to the west are the peaks of the Karlspitzen and the Fleischbank. To the north the Halt is preceded by the Predigtstuhl. The main crest of the mountain ridge runs away to the southwest, finally culminating in the Ackerlspitze and, to the northwest, steep rock faces plunge into the Griesner Cirque.  Routes  The Hintere Goinger Halt counts as one of the easiest and therefore one of the most frequented peaks in the Wilder Kaiser. Its summit cross may be reached in 40 minutes from the Ellmauer Tor on a straightforward, signed climbing path, although secure footing is required. On fine, summer's days numerous visitors jostle one another on the very small summit. The Vordere Goinger Halt is clearly more challenging and also accessible from the Ellmauer Tor. The route initially follows the climb to the Hinterer Goinger Halt, but bends right at a wind gap and follows a climbing route, that is only signed by cairns (Steinmandl). Therefater the route is rocky and exposed; requiring an unsecured UIAA grade II climb. The summit which has a summit register is reached after a good hour and offers not only a wide panorama, but also more peace than the Hintere Goinger Halt. A popular climbing route at grade III runs from the Predigtstuhl wind gap over the northern ar√™te to the summit of the Hintere Goinger Halt.

Etymology  The term \\"buffaloing\\" is documented as being used in the Wild West originally to refer to the act of being intimidated or cheated by bluffing. It would develop into a term meaning to strike someone with the butt of a handgun in the 1870's when Stuart N. Lake reported Wyatt Earp doing so. Wild Bill Hickok would also be a prominent practitioner of the technique. The new use of the term developed because the act of hitting someone with their revolver was seen as an additional insult to the character of the victim. The modern terms \\"pistol- whipping\\" and \\"to pistol-whip\\" were reported as \\"new words\\" of American speech in 1955, with cited usages dating to the 1940s.\\"Fifty Years Among the New Words: by John Algeo, p. 142, from vol. 30 (1955), no. 4 of the American Speech, the journal of the American Dialect Society Method The practice of using the handgun itself as a blunt-force weapon began with the appearance of muzzle loaders in the 15th century. Single-shot weapons that were tedious to reload were used to strike opponents directly in close-quarters combat after their projectile had been expended. It was entirely up to circumstance whether the user had time or chose to reverse the gun in their hand and strike a blow with its handle or merely swung the heavy weapon as a club or baton holding it normally. There are arguments as to the efficacy of either approach. Author Paul Wellman notes that clubbing an opponent with the butt of a gun held by its barrel, as seen in some Westerns, is problematic. First, the danger of an unintentional discharge could fatally wound the \\"clubber\\". Second, many handguns, specifically early revolvers of the black-powder cap and ball era, were relatively fragile around their cylinders relative to solid single-shot weapons. Finally, rotating a gun so that it can be held by its barrel takes extra time, potentially crucial in a conflict. To avoid the risk of damage or potential delay, pistol-whipping may be done with the gun held in an ordinary manner, hitting the target with an overhand strike from either the barrel or the flank of the gun above the trigger. It was a fairly common way to incapacitate a man in Western frontier days (assisted by the heavy weight of the handguns of the era), known as \\"buffaloing\\", with the verb form being \\"to buffalo\\".The Trampling Herd: The Story of the Cattle Range in America by Paul Iselin Wellman (1988) , p. 196.The True Life Wild West Memoir of a Bush- popping Cow Waddy, by Charley Hester, Kirby Ross, 2004, , Chapter 14: \\"Buffaloing\\". The practice was seen as a means of avoiding fatal confrontations. Instead of opening fire, an officer could knock someone unconscious with the barrel of their revolver which they claimed lowered mortality rates. This technique would later be considered a form of police brutality. This form of pistol-whipping with an 1870s-style revolver was tested on the Spike TV television show Deadliest Warrior.Deadliest Warrior, Season 2 Episode 3 \\"Jesse James vs Al Capone\\". The testers showed that using the long barrel of a weapon such as the Colt Single Action Army in a whipping motion produced enough force to fracture a skull and could potentially kill a man with a single blow. Forensics Pistol whipping may leave unusual lacerations on the body of the injured due to various protruding details of the pistol.\\"Pistol whipping\\", in Forensic Pathology, by David Dolinak, Evan W. Matshes, Emma O. Lew, 2006, , p. 185 When blows are struck using the butt of the weapon rather than its barrel or flank, semicircular or triangular lacerations on the skin may be produced. The magazine well at the bottom of a semi-automatic pistol and its surrounding base produce rectangular lacerations on the skin.\\"Gunshot Wounds: Practical Aspects of Firearms, Ballistics, and Forensic Techniques\\", Vincent J.M. DiMaio, 1999, , pp. 270-271 These lacerations can vary in depth and severity, but \\"whipped\\" fractures are common. The skin underneath the \\"whipped\\" area often will not present with bruising because the skin is split and not crushed.

The inventory was made following a commission of 14 September 1547 during the first year of the reign of Edward VI of England. The surviving manuscripts list the possessions of Henry VIII of England item by item, by their location in houses. The armaments of ships and forts are also recorded.Starkey, David, (1998), xix. Altogether there are 17,810 items listed, and some of these entries contain multiple objects. Despite this abundance, only a very small number of objects survive and can be identified. The monetary values of the objects were not recorded, though the weights of many gold and silver items were given. Manuscripts The three original manuscripts of the Inventory are; Society of Antiquaries MS 129A & B, and a duplicate copy at British Library Additional MS 46348; and British Library Harley MS 1419A & B. BL Add. MS 46348 was used in the Tower of London after the inventory was compiled to track changes in the royal collections and contains later annotations.Starkey, David, (1998), xx, the later annotations were not published in 1998. These manuscripts were edited and published in full for the first time in 1998. The published transcription allotted each item an index number to facilitate further study. The team of editors provided a thematic index of generic headings in alphabetical order. Within the index many heading provide short glossaries. This indexing solution to the large number of royal possessions has itself a helpful introduction running to three and half pages.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1, (1998), 441-444. Another manuscript lists the ships of Henry VIII's navy; the three Anthony Rolls are kept by Magdalene College, Cambridge, and the British Library, and were published in 2000.Knighton, C.S., & Loades, D.M., ed., The Anthony Roll of Henry VIII's navy, (2000): Pepys Library 2991 and British Library Add. MS 22047. Partial details of the royal library and other separate inventories of the King's books were also published in 2000.Carley, James P., ed., The libraries of King Henry VIII, British Library/British Academy (2000): The comparable and shorter inventories of James V of Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots were published in 1815, 1844, 1863 and 2004, from manuscripts in the National Archives of Scotland and British Library.see external links for publications of the Scottish manuscripts. The Whitehall Palace inventory of 1542 Over 4000 objects at Whitehall Palace in the keeping of Sir Anthony Denny were recorded in 1542. This inventory survives in manuscript the National Archives at Kew, PRO E315/160 and PRO E101/472/2, and at the British Library, BL Lansdowne Rolls 14 & 15. The Whitehall inventory was published in 2004.Hayward, Maria, ed., vol. 1, (2004). Another inventory of 1542 lists wardrobe stuff including tapestries and cushions at Windsor Castle in the keeping of William Tildesley, with later notes up to 1562.Catalogue of the books, manuscripts, autograph letters, and engravings, of the late Sir William Tite, sold by auction, Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge (London, 1874), p. 93: See also TNA E315/60. Henry's collection The inventory intended to list all of the late king's jewels, plate, stuff, ordinance, and munition. Commissioners were appointed to view the royal mansion houses, stables, and stores of munition. The sections below sketch aspects of this collection. =Gold, silver, and jewels= The Royal Gold Cup, high, across at its widest point; weight 1.935 kg of solid gold, enamels and jewels, showing Saint Agnes appearing to her friends in a vision. The inventory has 3690 entries for precious metals and stones. These include a coffer of Catherine Parr's jewels which remained at the Tower of London, amongst its contents were gold headresses set with pearls and diamonds (habillements); girdles with gold links set with diamonds, rubies and pearls; and two jewels fashioned with the initials HK, for Henry and Katherine.Starkey, David, ed., Inventory, (1998), 77-80, nos. 2619-2741. One more recent acquisition was the Three Brothers, a pendant of balas rubies, diamonds and pearls bought from Anton Fugger: > \\"A jewell bought by the kinges Majestie of Anthony fulker and his company of > Antewarpe in May 1551 and delivered to t'handes of the Earl of willteshere > lorde treasurer of England by the kinges Majestie the VIIth day of June > 1551. > A fayer flower of golde having sett in the same three table ballaces sett > withowte foyle, and between everey ballace a perle, and in the myddes > betwene the three ballaces a large pointed Diamounte and a perle pendaunt at > one of the ballaces.\\"Starkey, David, ed., Inventory, vol. 1 (1998), 98, no. > 3686. Edward VI was obliged to buy this jewel, which he described in his diary, for 100,000 crowns because the English crown owed ¬£60,000 to the Fugger's bank.Jordan, W. K., The Chronicle and Political Papers of Edward VI, George Allen & Unwin (1966), 60, 25 April 1551. The enamelled Royal Gold Cup which survives in the British Museum is listed simply as;Dalton 8, Jenny Stratford, 324, 320; the cup appears in all known Tudor inventories of the royal plate. \\"a Cuppe of gold with Imagerie, the knopp a crowne Imperiall and aboute the bordre of the cover and the foote a Crowne garnished with lxii garnishing perles weying lxxix oz,\\" and identified by its original number of pearls.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1 (1998), no. 42. The \\"knopp a crowne Imperiall\\" and \\"the bordre of the cover\\" with its pearls were lost at some point between the 17th and 19th centuries. Notes in the inventory record diplomatic gifts given and some incidents; in the summer of 1552, Edward VI lost a large pearl pendant from a gold chain while riding between Titchfield and Southampton. The pearl was found and returned in May 1553.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1 (1998), no. 2209. =Palaces and houses= Apart from collections of jewels and the stores of the Royal Wardrobe, items were listed in the houses where they were kept. Henry had 55 different palaces. As well as Henry's major palaces, the contents of his children's homes and wardrobes were listed. These include; * Manor of Beddington, Surrey, in the charge of Sir Michael Stanhope. * Durham Place, London, former home of Prince Edward. * The More, Hertfordshire, Wardrobe in the charge of Richard Hobbes. * Manor of Nonsuche, Surrey, Wardrobe in the charge of Sir Thomas Cawarden. * Nottingham Castle, Wardrobe in the charge of Thomas Clyeff. * Manor of Otelands, in the charge of Sir Anthony Brown, Master of the King's Horses and Keeper of Oatlands. * New Hall or the Manor of Beaulieu, Essex, in the charge of the Marquis of Northampton, usual home of Lady Mary.Madden, Frederick, Privy Purse Expenses of Princess Mary, William Pickering, London, (1831), cvi-cvii. * Manor of Richmond, Surrey, Wardrobe in the charge of William Griffithe. * Sudeley Castle, Gloucestershire, effects of Catherine Parr. * Woodstock Palace, Oxfordshire. * Hampton Court, London. The elaborate furnishing textiles and beds of these houses are listed in detail. Beyond this general magnificence, the inventory hints at Henry VIII's own interests and activities; at Westminster Palace there was a little study called the New Library, with equipment for writing, drawing, painting and surveying. Two shelves held patterns for castles and engines of war, and there was a portfolio for plans, noted as 'a case for a platte covered with leather.'Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1 (1998), nos. 17479-17522. =Tapestry and textiles= The Triumph of Hercules, part of a series of Antiques woven for Henry VIII In 1906 the historian and tapestry- maker W. G. Thomson commented on the 1547 inventory that the king, \\"had a perfect mania for acquiring tapestries by any means that presented itself.\\" Thomson was first to print the full list of tapestries but omitted the dimensions. These were given in English yards, or French and Flemish ells. In total, Thomas P. Campbell estimates the inventory list at approximately 2,450 tapestry wall hangings, and 300 other tapesty furnishings.Campbell, Thomas P., Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty, Yale, (2007), ix, xi: Thomson, W. G., A History of Tapestry, 3rd ed., (1930), 242, 245-262. An entry for one of the newer suites listed in the Wardrobe at Westminster reads; > \\"Item vii peces of fine newe Tapsterie of the Historye of Vulcanus Mars and > venus lined withe Canvas whereof one pece conteyneth in Lengthe v yerdes iii > quarters di The iide pece conteyneth in lengthe vii yerdes quarter di The > iiide pece conteyneth in lengthe vi yerdes di the iiiith in lengthe v yerdes > iii quarters The vth in lengthe vii yerdes quarter The vith in length vi > yerdes di and the viith in length vii yerdes quarter everye of the saide > peces conteyning in depthe iiii yerdes quarter di.\\"Starkey, David, ed., The > Inventory, vol. 1 (1998), p.209 no. 9729. Amongst the many other furnishing textiles of embroidered silk and brocade in the Wardrobe at Hampton Court there was a crimson bed and a pair of crimson satin cushions embroidered with the arms of James V of Scotland.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory, vol. 1 (1998), p.278, nos. 12136, 12174. These items may have been seized at Edinburgh in 1544. =Revels= The properties of the Master of Revels, Thomas Cawarden run to 237 items. As well as costumes for court Masques for men and women, and bards (decorative trappings for horses), Cawarden was also keeper of the royal tents.

Tents from the royal store were issued to the Earl of Warwick for his military campaign to Scotland in the Summer of 1547, including a pavilion and hale (hall tent) of the \\"King's highness' lesser Lodging,\\" to be used for the commander's field headquarters. (nos.8765-8839) Cawarden had extra expense drying these tents, which came back \\"from Skotland wetted in the shippe.\\"Kempe, A.J., ed., Loseley Manuscripts, London (1836), 104 =Musical instruments= Most of the listed musical instruments were kept at Westminster Palace by Philip van Wilder.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, (1998), 265-267. The decoration distinguished some of the larger pieces. Some were painted in the 'antique manner', decoration in renaissance character incorporating Italianate grotesques.

The inventory details body armour supplied from the Hampton Court armoury for the Scottish expedition. There was also iron shot for captured Scottish guns stored at Calais.Patten, William, The Expedition in Scotland, 1547, London (1548), for 11 Sept. 1547: Starkey, David, ed., Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1 (1998), p.102, nos. 3707-3712, 4919; p.162 nos. 8424-5, p. 163, 8476. Shot, powder, gunnery tools, and other equipment was recorded. Some cannon were old, dangerous, broken, or un-mounted, and the lists noted broken firing chambers for breech-loaders. Some of these broken cannon had burst when firing salutes. The Ordnance house at Calais had accumulated quantities of iron shot of redundant calibre.

Loosely based on the Taken Out format, the show is produced by JSBC: Jiangsu Television and taped in Nanjing. It was first broadcast on January 15, 2010, and originally aired twice a week on Saturdays and Sundays until December 2014. From January 2015 to March 2017, it aired on Saturday nights at 9:10 pm on Jiangsu TV. Starting from January 2018, it air on Saturday nights at 8:30 pm. In 2013, the show began broadcasting in Australia on SBS 2 (now SBS Viceland), in an hour-long version with English subtitles provided by SBS. If You Are the One has been a ratings success in China and is now the highest-rated show for Jiangsu TV. Episodes are also widely distributed online. The show is viewed internationally over the internet and satellite television. The show's popularity and social commentary has drawn attention of academics and foreign media, and after concerns from Chinese regulators in 2011 the show's format was tweaked to de-emphasize factors such as financial wealth. After a short break from March 2017 to May 2017, If You Are the One returned in a revised format. In December 2019, it was announced that If You Are the One will be returning to the original format in January 2020 for the 10th anniversary celebrations. Huang Han and Huang Lei returns for the celebratory episodes, whilst Chen Ming was announced as Jiang Zhenyu's replacement as guest speaker for the 2020 season following the end of the revised 2017 format. History =Conception and popularity= ‚ÄúIf You Are the One\\" is currently the most-viewed dating show in the Chinese-speaking world. According to Beijing-based CSM Media Research, the audience ratings for Fei Cheng Wu Rao - which as of May 22, 2013 had screened a total of 343 episodes - were 2.77 percent of television viewers, or 36 million, twice as many as the nearest competitor for that timeslot. The idea of the show was brought to Jiangsu Television by veteran television producer Wang Peijie, who worked in collaboration with Columbia University-educated Xing Wenning. The pair drew inspiration from the Taken Out format, however when the rights for that show were instead won by a rival network, If You Are the One was launched instead. Wang said that the show is a window into Chinese society at large, and that through it, \\"you can tell what China is thinking about and chasing after.\\" The show's focus was intended to be young professionals. While most of the contestants are in their twenties, there have been instances of male contestants as old as 48 appearing on the show. If You Are the One experienced great popularity in its first broadcast because of its unique approach to dating and the conversations that are often humorous with friendly insults. The show sought to 'stretch the limits' of what could be discussed on Chinese television. Unlike Taken Out, If You Are the One does not rely on audience participation, use of catchphrases or physical attractiveness among male contestants. Also, different from dating shows in the late 1990s, such as The Rose which mainly discussed private matters such as personality and hobbies, If You Are the One engages more with larger socioeconomic issues such as pre- marriage property notarization and gender equality. =Controversy and revisions= In the first half of 2010, the show broke ratings records, with some 50 million watching every episode, an audience second only to the CCTV evening news broadcast Xinwen Lianbo. In the initial format of the show, the contestants reported things such as their annual earnings, their material possessions, etc. During this phase several contestants earned notoriety and became internet sensations. Female contestant Ma Nuo became a media interest after her controversial remarks to a male contestant that she would \\"prefer to cry in a BMW\\" than laugh riding on the back of a bicycle. One male contestant, a son of a businessman, was rejected by all 24 women on one episode for egregiously showing off his sports cars and bank statements instead of his life and interests. There have been three different male contestants who have lost the show in the beginning when the female contestants first study the male. Both controversial contestants were some of the most-talked-about people in Chinese entertainment. In addition, concerns were raised that some of the contestants on the show were not who they said they were, and that the TV station was 'planting' contestants to make controversial remarks to increase ratings. Chinese authorities looked upon the show unfavourably, asserting that it was spreading the 'wrong values' and 'advocating materialism'. State media editorialized against the show on television, in print, and online. Six months after the show first aired, officials from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stepped in to regulate the show. SARFT issued two Notifications to standardize Chinese reality TV shows, urging the shows to recall social responsibilities and promoting traditional Chinese virtues. From that point forward, Fei Cheng Wu Rao was to curb mentions of financial wealth and sex, and a third host was added: a party school psychology teacher named Huang Han, who was seen to 'balance' the show to make it more grounded and less controversial as well as adding more banter between the three hosts. A wholesale replacement of the contestant pool with more tame individuals followed. The revised program scrubbed contestant information such as bank account information and salaries etc. Also omitted is the 'final opinions' on a departing male contestant from the women; previously this part of the show was especially prone to pointed insults and ridicule. Moreover, the original reel of the show must undergo heavy editing before airing depending on length and number of contestants present. Despite the changed format, the show remains extremely popular. =2016 revision= In January 2016, as a result of a Chinese judge ruling that the show's name \\"Fei Cheng Wu Rao\\" infringed another individual's copyright who owned the same name as the show, the producers temporarily changed the name of the show to \\"Yuan Lai Fei Cheng Wu Rao\\" (although the English name seems to have stayed the same).http://ent.sina.com.cn/z/v/2016-01-15/doc-ifxnqriy2944585.shtml Jiangsu Television station has promised to appeal the ruling. Between November 19 to December 10, 2016, a series of specials titled \\"1vs24\\" was aired where the roles of the genders were reversed with 24 Males taking to the podiums to face a single female. The gameplay of the special episodes was the same as the normal episodes. Another series of 1vs24 specials was aired between March 4 to March 25, 2017. On December 31, 2016, the Guangdong High Court overturned the decision on appeal by ruling that \\"Fei Cheng Wu Rao\\" did not infringe on another individual's copyrights and therefore the producers changed the name of the show back to \\"Fei Cheng Wu Rao\\" =2017 revision= On April 1, 2017, Jiangsu Television announced that the final episode of If You Are The One in the original format had aired on March 25 with the filming of shows suspended since January, announcing a temporary suspension of the show as it undergoes reformatting for a relaunch late in May. Meng Fei continued to be the host of the revised format of the show. Jiang Zhenyu became the guest speaker. The revised version was first aired on May 13, 2017. = 2018 = The 2018 version was first aired on January 6, 2018. On February 3, 2018, Huang Lan returned to the show as female commentator, partnering with Jiang Zhenyu. = 2020 = The 2020 version was first aired on January 4, 2020 and celebrates 10 years of If You Are the One. The show will return to the original format for 2020 after 3 years under the 2017 revised format. Chen Ming will partner as the male commentator with Huang Lan. Former guest Huang Han joins in during the special edition aired between January 4, 2020, to January 18, 2020. A new addition ‚ÄúÊô∫Êé®Â•≥Áîü‚Äù or \\"Recommended Lady\\" purported to use big data and artificial intelligence to recommend the best match for the single man. The best match is calculated during the first segment and unveiled during the last segment. Premise :For the gameplay of the 2017 revised format that aired between May 2017 and December 2019, see If You Are the One (2017 game show)#Gameplay Twenty-four women stand in an arc, each behind a podium with a light that they initially turn on. The women face a single man, who chooses one of them as his \\"heartbeat girl\\" (simplified Chinese: ÂøÉÂä®Â•≥Áîü) from sight alone before any conversation between the women and the single man has taken place. His choice of \\"heartbeat girl\\" is initially known only to himself and the host of the programme - although there has been one instance where this has been revealed soon after. The single man uses two or three video clips to reveal some personal information such as occupation, interests, love history and friends' opinions. During each video clip, each of the women decides whether or not he is still \\"date-worthy\\" in her opinion by keeping her light on or turning it off. The contestants, psychologists and host frequently exchange banter with each other when video clips aren't being shown. If a girl doesn't like the man, she will turn her light off (followed by a sound cue). If, after all the videos have been played, there are more than two girls still with lights on, the man goes and turns off some of those lights, choosing only two of the remaining girls to come up on stage as finalists. After that, the identity of the man's \\"heartbeat girl\\" is revealed. She too is invited onto the stage (if not already there) as a finalist. A new procedural option (simplified Chinese: ÁàÜÁÅØ; literally: \\"burst light\\"), enabling a woman to signal a special interest in the man, was introduced to the programme in the episode broadcast on 20 October 2012. It can be activated only once per round, and is heralded by a \\"smashing\\" sound cue, followed by a show of pulsating hearts, along with the number of the woman who \\"burst the light\\", on display screens around the studio. It is essentially the opposite of turning the podium light off; instead, a woman who \\"bursts the light\\" is choosing to signal her interest in the man demonstratively rather than just passively leaving her light on. If a woman has activated the \\"burst light\\", her light cannot be turned off; instead, her light changes to a pulsating heart display, and she is guaranteed a place as a finalist at the end of the round. If a woman has activated the \\"burst light\\", she is now invited onto the stage as a finalist. Thus, there can end up being two, three or four women on the stage as finalists. The man puts to the finalists a question that he chooses from a set menu of queries. Following that, he can put to the finalists an original question of his own. After that, if one of the finalists had \\"burst the light\\", she is given an opportunity to explain her interest in the man and why she should be chosen. If the man elects to take one of the finalists who had shown interest in him (i.e., hadn't turned her light off), he walks to her, takes her hand, and they depart for a presumed future date. The man may insist on his \\"heartbeat girl\\" even if she had turned her light off. In that case, the other finalists are dismissed back to their podiums, and the man is given an opportunity to win his \\"heartbeat girl\\" over. She may accept him as her date and depart with him, or reject him and return to her podium. Occasionally, a man elects to choose none of the finalists and to depart alone. The post-game interview appears with the man alone, or with him and his chosen girl if he is \\"successful\\".

It opened in 2008 and has produced an average of 2,500 barrels of beer annually in their 15-barrel brewhouse. In May 2017, the brewery announced they were selling a majority stake to Boston, Massachusetts-based private-equity firm Castanea Partners. Products The Bruery's products are considered to be experimental ales brewed in the Belgian tradition. Using a proprietary Belgian yeast strain for the majority of their beer, The Bruery creates beers through their use of unique ingredients such as coriander, bitter orange peel and lavender in their \\"Orchard White\\" or bacteria such as Pediococcus and Lactobacillus along with Pinot noir grapes in their \\"Pinotlambicus\\". The Bruery is also known for their use of oak barrels (both bourbon and wine) for the fermentation and aging of their beers. They have also become known for their strong bourbon aged ales that can range between 13% and 19.5% alcohol by volume (typical beers have around 3% to 7% alcohol by volume). One beer is a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout known as \\"Black Tuesday\\". This beer is released only once each year on the final Tuesday of October and is named for both the economic downturn of the Great Depression as well as the disastrous day at the brewery when it was first brewed. Several batches are brewed and aged in oak barrels to later be blended to taste and bottled for release. It was first released in October 2009 and was 19.5% abv. The October 2010 release was 18.2% abv. There are also several variants of Black Tuesday including Chocolate Rain, a version of the beer with cocoa nibs and vanilla beans added to it. =Special release collection= The Bruery releases a number of small batch beers throughout the year. Often, these beers are only made once and never again, and sometimes they are oak aged beers that are only released once a year. The collection includes many of their beers including Black Tuesday, Melange #3 and The Bruery Anniversary Ale Series. Their Oude Tart is also included in this collection and it won a gold medal in the Belgian Style Lambic or Sour Ale category at both the 2010 World Beer Cup and the 2010 Great American Beer Festival. The Bruery Provisions In September 2010 The Bruery opened a retail establishment in Old Towne Orange that specialized in beer, wine, cheese, charcuterie and other specialty foods. They sold bottles to go and also held onsite tastings. In 2013, The Bruery closed their Bruery Provisions store to focus on more exclusively on brewing and managing their many reserve societies. The store was reopened simply with the name \\"Provisions\\" and is operated by nearby restaurant Haven Gastropub.

Location Kasoa has territory in 1 of the 20 Metropolitan, Municipalities and Districts (MMADs) in the Central Region of Ghana: Awutu Senya East Municipal Assembly (ASEMA). It is the largest and fastest growing town and municipality. The city is situated along the Accra-Cape Coast Road and, approximately , by road, west of Kotoka International Airport, the International Airport that serves Ghana's capital city of Accra. Road Distance Between Accra International Airport And Kasoa With Map approximately , by road, west of the central business district of the city of Accra.Map Showing Accra And Kasoa (Odupongkpehe) With Distance Marker The coordinates of the town are:05 31 12N, 00 28 48W (Latitude:5.5200; Longitude:-0.4800). The average elevation of Kasoa is 75 m above sea level. Climate Kasoa experiences a five-month dry season lasting from November through March. During the dry season, the northeast trade winds are prominent. The dry season is followed by a seven-month rainy season that lasts from April through October. During this rainy season, the southwest monsoon winds are most common. The rainy season is usually characterized by flooding, low crop yield, and financial strain for a large portion of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's population. Population Awutu Ofaakor are the indigenous to Odupongkpehe/Kasoa. Awutu, Akan and English are the most commonly spoken languages. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is traditionally home to the Awutu tribe who belong to the guan ethnic group. Today, it is home to other ethnic groups such as Hausas, Gas, Akans, Ewes, Walas/Dagartis, Moshies, Basares and other smaller tribes. As of 2010, Odupongkpehe/ Kasoa's population was estimated to be 370,384 people. Ghana has experienced rapid population growth in the past three decades. The population growth directly affects /Odupongkpehe/Kasoa, and other peri-urban areas. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is reported to be one of the fastest growing communities in West Africa. This growth is revealed by an examination and comparison of /Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's population in 1970, 1984, 2000, and 2010. In 1970, Odupongkpehe/Kasoa had a population of 863. In 1984 the population was 2,597. In 2000 the population was 34,719. In 2010 the population grew to 69,384. Clearly, there has been an increase in the population size over the past 40 years. Comparing the change in population between the aforementioned dates proves the fact that the population is increasing at an increasing rate. From 1970-1984 the population increased by 1,734 people. Between 1884‚Äì2000, the population increased by 32,122 people. Lastly, from 2000‚Äì2010, the population increased by 34,665. The net population growth between 1970 and 2010 is 68,521. This means that in the past 40 years, Odupongkpehe/Kasoa has multiplied by more than 79 times what it was in 1970. This close consideration of the population reported by the National Analytical Report quantitatively indicates just how fast the population of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa has been and is continuing to grow. Approximately 4 decades ago, Odupongkpehe/Kasoa was a rural community; it is now very rapidly urbanizing. Since 2000, the ‚Äúspill-over effect‚Äù of the growing population of the Accra-Tema metropolitan area into smaller towns around the edges has contributed greatly to the rapid increase in the populations of towns, like Odupongkpehe/Kasoa. Challenges associated with living in the overly crowded urban centers such as transportation and safe/affordable housing have influenced individuals working in the Urban centers to have their place of residence be in a nearby settlements‚Äîoften peri-urban areas like Odupongkpehe/Kasoa‚Äîand commute into the urban center for work.Yankson, P.W.K, (2012). Landlordism and housing production in Greater Accra Metropolitan Accra. In: Ardayfio-Schandorf, Yankson, PWK & Bertrand, M. (Eds.). The mobile city of Accra: urban families, housing and residential practices. Daker, Senegal, CODESRIA. The population growth of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa and its repercussions can be understood as the result of urban sprawl. Rural-Urban migration due to diminished economic opportunities in rural Ghana and migration to Accra has led to a huge urban sprawl, which is the spreading of an urban population into surrounding areas such as peri-urban Odupongkpehe/Kasoa. This sprawl has had very specific and identifiable effects on Odupongkpehe/Kasoa, due to the fact that the growth was spontaneous and unplanned.Yeboah, Ian (Spring 2000). \\"Structural Adjustment and Emerging Urban Form in Accra, Ghana\\". Africa Today 47 (2): 61‚Äì89. This spontaneous growth imposed a large number of inhabitants on a town that did not have the infrastructure nor the established planning. Subsequently, the original name, Eshaapa has been subsumed by Odupongkpehe/Kasoa, a name bestowed by migrant settlers who have dominated the population. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is finding ways to cope with issues that have arisen from the combination of a rapidly increasing population and infrastructure that was intended for a much smaller population size. Due to indiscriminate, unplanned and haphazard development, traffic has become a major issue that the institutions and the individuals of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa are both combating and learning to cope with. Another major issue is insufficient market space for a growing number of sellers. Further more, as a result of the continual increase in Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's population, there is an increasing demand for residential land to accommodate the quickly growing population. This demand has resulted in the conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural land. This conversion deeply effects the livelihoods of a large number of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's farmers. Politics In 1957, Ghana became the first African country to declare independence from European colonization.\\"Exploring Africa ‚Äì Decolinization\\". exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu. Retrieved 29 February 2012. Until 2007, Kasoa was fully encompassed by a single district, the Awutu Effutu Senya District. In 2007, the district split into the Awutu Senya district to the north and Effutu Municipal to the south. Soon after the split, the Kasoa Urban Council became one of the two urban councils in the Awutu Senya district. In 2012, the Awutu Senya East Municipal Assembly (ASEMA) was formed in an effort to support the government's decentralization programs and to strengthen local governments. Kasoa is now the administrative capital of ASEMA. The political organization of Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is ‚Äúsemi-traditional.‚Äù This can be considered to follow the framework of a centralized system. It is a society ruled by a chief whose authority is to be recognized by all who live within the established boundaries of his territory. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is also politically supported by administrative and judicial institutions. These institutions have changed drastically due to the influence of colonial and modern institutions. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's traditional political institution is traditional Akan Chieftaincy. According to Article 277 of Ghana's Constitution, a chief is ‚Äúa person, who, hailing from the appropriate family and lineage, has been validly nominated, elected, or selected and enstooled or installed as a chief or queen-mother in accordance with the relevant customary law and usage.‚Äù The Paramount Chief (Omanhene) is at the top of the hierarchy of chieftaincy. The Paramount Chief is the head of the Traditional Council and a direct representative of the state. Below the Paramount Chief is the Paramount Queen Mother (Ohemaa). The Queen Mother is responsible for issues related to women, social affairs, and social conduct. She is also responsible for rituals concerning women and for settling disputed among women to ‚Äúensure that all women live in peace and harmony.‚Äù The Paramount Queenmother also selects the Paramount Chief for consideration by Regency Council on the death of the Paramount Chief. Beneath the Paramount Chief and the Paramount Queen Mother are Senior Divisional Chiefs, sub-divisional chiefs, and Town chiefs. There are also chiefs who perform special functions in the palaces of these key chiefs ranging from linguist to caretaker of the youth and the aged to protection from enemies. Odpongkpehe/Kasoa's chief is Nai Odupong Awushie Tetteh II and the Benkumhene or Ebla Odefey Division of the Awutu Paramountcy. The traditional customs of land ownership in Odupongkpehe/Kasoa are unique. The land sellers are the chiefs and the family heads and the purchase of land does not guarantee ownership, it only guarantees access to the land as its caretaker for an agreed upon duration; after which the land will be returned to the ownership of the original seller. There has been a major shift from agricultural land to residential and commercial land and land value has increased from GH500 to GH10,000 per plot. As a result, peri-urban agricultural opportunities are decreasing drastically as land is converted into commercial and residential land. As land becomes increasingly developed, the chief has the authority to decide what land will be developed. The chief then informs the family living on the desired land that the land will be developed. The family is then supposed to be allowed to keep and live off of 1/3 of the land while the remaining 2/3 is granted to the developer. However, there have been reports that suggest that this practice is occasionally not honored and that the land is re-allocated, in its entirety, to the developer. However steps are being taken by the national government to address these anomalies. Recently at the sod-cutting ceremony for the construction of the Mallam Junction Interchange, the Odupong chiefs were allowed to do the traditional pouring of libation. This did not sit well with some self-styled Ga chiefs from Gbawe who organized a protest but this was met with derision by the sitting President of the Republic of Ghana at the time, J.A. Kufuor. He told them that the documents in Government possession indicate it is Awutu not Ga land. This has spurred efforts to recover the said documents and obtain judgements at the courts. Economy Odupongkpehe/Kasoa is home to one of the most prominent markets in the Awutu-Senya district. Agro-processed products are popular items at these markets. One of these products is cassava that is processed into popular food items called ‚Äòagbelima‚Äô and ‚Äògari‚Äô. Agriculture and business associated with agriculture is one of the leading economic activities for Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's working population. Farming and fishing are very popular in the lowlands near the coast. In 2013, construction of an Abattoir‚Äîa slaughter house‚Äîwas begun in order to enable Odupongkpehe/Kasoa to provide more food for its rapidly growing population. In response to the growing need for peri-urban transport, private enterprises have been developed in the form of privately owned trotro and shared taxis which provide transportation for passengers, goods, and animals. Odupongkpehe/Kasoa's market is the main regional market.Porter, Gina; Kate Hampshire, Peter Kyei, Michael Adjaloo, George Rapoo, and Kate Kilpatrick (2008). \\"Linkages between livelihood opportunities and refugee‚Äìhost relations: learning from the experiences of Liberian camp-based refugees in Ghana\\". Journal of refugee studies 21 (2): 230‚Äì252. The market is consistently packed and it is often difficult for new traders to be able to sell their goods at the market because all of the stalls are occupied. In 1991 the plans for a new market in /Odupongkpehe/Kasoa were established and the plot of land where the market was to be built was purchased. However, due to a lack of funding, construction could not begin until ten years later. Construction of the new market began in 2001, during President J.A. Kufuor's administration, after funds were provided by NGOs and with the cooperation of the Awutu Senya East Municipal Assembly.\\"Kasoa new market needs immediate attention - Association\\" (http://graphic.com.gh/archive/Business-News/Odupongkpehe/kasoa-new-market- needs-immediate-attention-association.html). Graphic communications group. Retrieved 31 March 2014. In January 2013, the market was improved. Through the combined efforts of the Awutu Senya East Municipal Assembly and the Odupongkpehe/Kasoa Traders Association, new stalls were built for traders at the market. Transportation is a major issue that many individuals from Odupongkpehe/Kasoa and neighboring areas must face in order to be able to participate in the marketplace.Porter, Gina (2002). \\"Living in a walking world: rural mobility and social equity issues in sub-Saharan Africa\\". World development 30 (2): 285‚Äì300. Many must overcome the obstacles of heavy traffic, poor road conditions, and/or unaffordable public transportation, in order to access the market. Those who face these issues may be at an economic disadvantage when unreliable transport results in the late arrival to the market. Once a seller has arrived late, shoppers may have already purchased significant amounts of goods from sellers who were not affected by the unreliable transportation and were able to be at the market on time. A study conducted in Odupongkpehe/Kasoa surveyed 305 micro and small scale enterprises and revealed that 77.78% of the business owners had no knowledge about cash management procedures.Attom, Ben Ebo. Cash management practices by micro and small-scale enterprises at Odupongkpehe/Kasoa in the central region of Ghana. The study argued that this is an indicator of the need for proper training of business owners in the realm of cash management in order to initiate capacity building. Another survey conducted in the Odupongkpehe/Kasoa market, although concerned largely with the oil sales sector, revealed a number of issues face by individuals whose livelihoods depend on sales in the market.Baidoo, E.A; P.N.T. Johnson (2001). Survey on some constraints facing cooking oil sellers at selected markets in Accra. One issue that the study revealed was difficulty with hygienically storing goods and keeping them from spoiling. The survey indicated that 59% of the salespersons had no education and used a variety of techniques (both effective and ineffective) for preserving their goods. 90% inappropriately stored their goods, which were exposed to too much sun and/or potentially contaminated by unhygienic storage practices such as storing goods in dirty containers. The interviewees greatest concerns were low-profits, unsteady demand, unreliable competition, the unavailability of space and the lack of funds to expand their business, Demand for many goods shift seasonally. For example, oil sales spike during the seasons where fish are plentiful because traditional fish processors purchase oil from the market for frying fish. Unreliable sales competition is a large issue for traders who sell goods that can be purchased from large producers at a lower cost. Furthermore, 80% of sellers reported that they needed help in the area of finance in order to expand their businesses. Ghana Rural Action Support Program (GRASP) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that has initiated micro-finance loans for women in order to empower women and boost female economic activity in Odupongkpehe/Kasoa.Adjei-Bosompem, Eunice (2013). Journal of Global Gender Studies 1 (1). An article in the Journal of Global Gender Studies, reports that studies conducted by Eunice Adjei-Bosompem in 2013 suggested that the initial loan amounts were insufficient for women to successfully start and sustain on-going income generating activities (IGAs). The resulting suggestions for improving the short-term and long-term effectiveness of micro-finance loans were to increase loan amounts and loan return time, in addition to encouraging the development and utilization of technologies that will increase productivity.

Care UK delisted from the stock exchange in 2010 following a management buyout. Since 2010 its major shareholder has been Bridgepoint Capital. It bought Harmoni in 2012 from ECI Partners for about ¬£50 million. In January 2014 it was announced that Philippa Slinger, the former chief executive of the troubled Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was to join Care UK. After the Health and Social Care Act 2012 came into force in April 2013, by November 2014 Care UK had won three contracts worth ¬£104m. Following the death of a vulnerable inmate at HM Prison Chelmsford in January 2017 and criticism by the Prison ombudsman, Care UK announced it would end its healthcare contract there as the level of resource the prison service made available was insufficient. In 2017/8 its turnover was ¬£684.7 million. Services In 2018 Care UK operated 114 care homes with almost 8,000 beds. 44% of the residents are self-funding. It supports over 17,000 older people and those with disabilities through home care services. , its NHS treatment centres, out of hours primary care and 111 service handle more than 18 million patient interactions a year. The company runs two clinical assessment and treatment centres (CATS) and nine NHS treatment centres, offering a range of procedures for conditions such as cataract surgery and hip replacements. In 2011, independent research organisation, Dr Foster, named Care UK as the best performing provider for hip operations. Care UK also operates 12 GP-led health centre facilities providing walk-in services and a range of specialist mental health services including 18 homes and hospitals and residential treatment programmes for young people who have serious eating disorders. In 2013 a joint venture with Sussex Partnership NHS Trust was created to purchase a 32-bed mental health rehabilitation unit in Gosport, and to create a 24-bed self-contained accommodation unit later in the year. The company's strategy is to concentrate on the provision of primary and secondary NHS health services. In May 2015 the company sold its mental health assets, consisting of 322 beds, to Partnerships in Care and its learning disability services group to Lifeways Group. In June 2015 the home care service which generated revenue of ¬£72.2 million and looks after approximately 13,000 people across the UK and employs around 6,000 staff members was sold to Mears Group. It is the largest firm providing out-of-hours services in England services with more than ten million patients. It retained a ¬£55 million contract to run the North East London Treatment Centre in Redbridge in September 2017, after a bid by Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, after complaining about the conduct of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge and Havering CCGs which ran the tendering process. Controversies =Political donations= In November 2009 John Nash, the chairman of Care UK, made a donation of ¬£21,000 to the private office of Andrew Lansley, who would later become Secretary of State for Health, but was at the time the health spokesman for the opposition. Lansley was later accused of a conflict of interest, as Care UK would be a major beneficiary of proposed changes. In 2014, Care UK's former chairman Lord Nash became a government minister and Care UK took over services for people with severe learning disabilities in Doncaster, south Yorkshire, where they immediately cut wages of staff who had been on NHS terms by up to 35% while bringing in 100 new workers on ¬£7 an hour. Fifty carers for the disabled began strike action in protest and by August 2014, had been on strike for seven weeks, making it one of the longest strikes in the history of the NHS. Care UK won the supported living contract from the council after telling officials that it could deliver it for ¬£6.7m over three years, yet the wage bill alone for the service was ¬£7m. =Alleged tax avoidance= A report in The Guardian of 17 March 2012 stated that Care UK \\"has a reduced tax bill by taking out loans through the Channel Islands stock exchange and coming to an agreement with HMRC\\". Another report by the same newspaper in August 2014 stated that \\"Care UK has not paid a penny in corporation tax\\" since it was bought by the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital in 2010. =Ealing Hospital= In July 2015, ITV's Exposure programme uncovered poor practice in the urgent care centre run by the firm at Ealing Hospital. Failings included: * Pregnant women with ectopic pregnancies waiting 3 hours before being seen by a GP; * Empty medicine cabinets and doctors admitting they frequently ran out of painkillers and antibiotics; * Work experience students checking up on patients because doctors and nurses were too busy; * GPs admitting they can‚Äôt understand X-rays ‚Äòfor s***‚Äô and may miss fractures; * Clinics dealing with 50 per cent more patients than they could manage; * Patients told to take their own temperature. It is also alleged that staff registered the discharge of patients before they had been treated to avoid breaching the four-hour wait target. Ealing Clinical Commissioning Group and Healthwatch Ealing both investigated the situation. Ealing Council considered the service at a meeting of its scrutiny committee in September 2015. The CCG agreed to pay for an additional GP and said that the service was still considered safe.

Routes  Numerous signposted routes lead to the Stripsenkopf. As a rule they do not pose any problems and are therefore very frequently used. The normal route begins at the Griesner Alm (1,000 m) and leads via the Stripsenjochhaus to the summit with its wooden pavilion after about 2.5 hours.

Founded in 1870 by the Jesuits, Loyola is one of the largest Catholic universities in the United States. Loyola's professional schools include programs in medicine, nursing, and health sciences anchored by the Loyola University Medical Center. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". Comprising eleven colleges and schools, Loyola offers over 80 undergraduate and 140 graduate/professional programs and enrolls approximately 17,000 students. Loyola has six campuses across the Chicago metropolitan area, as well as a campus in Rome and guest programs in Beijing and Ho Chi Minh City. The flagship Lake Shore Campus is on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods of Chicago, eight miles north of the Loop. Loyola's athletic teams, nicknamed the Ramblers, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Missouri Valley Conference. Loyola won the 1963 NCAA men's basketball championship, and remains the only school from Illinois to do so. The Ramblers are also two-time (2014, 2015) NCAA champions in men's volleyball. Among the more than 150,000 Loyola alumni,Key Facts. luc.edu there are executives of major Chicago-based corporations such as McDonald's and Baxter International, as well as dozens of local and national political leaders including the current Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives. Loyola alumni have won Emmy, Grammy, Peabody, and Pulitzer awards, as well as Guggenheim and MacArthur fellowships.  History  Madonna della Strada Chapel Loyola was established as St. Ignatius College on June 30, 1870, by Jesuit priest and educator Fr. Arnold Damen. At that time Chicago was a much smaller, but rapidly growing, city just shy of 300,000 people, and as a result the original campus was much closer to the city center along Roosevelt Road. In 1909 the school was renamed Loyola University, and in 1912 it began to move to the current Lake Shore Campus; today the original building is part of St. Ignatius College Prep, adjacent to the University of Illinois at Chicago. To meet the growing needs of Chicago, Loyola established professional schools in law (1908), medicine (1909), business (1922), and nursing (1935). The Chicago College of Dental Surgery became part of the university in 1923, and was closed 70 years later. A downtown campus was founded in 1914, and with it the School of Sociology. As the predecessor to the School of Social Work, it enrolled Loyola's first female students, though the school would not become fully coeducational until 1966. Loyola Academy, a college prep high school, occupied Dumbach Hall on the Lake Shore Campus until it was relocated to north suburban Wilmette in 1957. The current Water Tower Campus opened in 1949. In 1962, Loyola opened a campus in Rome near the site of the 1960 Summer Olympics. In 1969, Loyola established the School of Education and consolidated medical programs at the Loyola University Medical Center, a hospital and health care complex located in Maywood, an immediate suburb of Chicago. The university legally separated from the Jesuits in 1970, and today is under lay control and governed by a board of trustees. Loyola purchased neighboring Mundelein College in 1991. Mundelein CenterMajor capital campaigns since the turn of the century have greatly enhanced Loyola's academic profile and campuses. In 2005 the Loyola University Museum of Art was established on the Water Tower Campus, and the Rome campus was renamed in honor of Director Emeritus John P. Felice. In 2009, the Cuneo Foundation presented the university with the Cuneo Mansion and Gardens, a 100-acre estate with an Italianate mansion and extensive collections of art and furnishings located in suburban Vernon Hills. The $50 million gift is the largest in Loyola history. In 2010, Loyola purchased the Resurrection Retreat Center in Woodstock, which became the school's fifth campus for retreat and ecological study. In 2012, Loyola alumnus Michael R. Quinlan donated $40 million to the business school, which was renamed in his honor. During this time over 200,000 square-feet of LEED-certified sustainable spaces have been built on the Lake Shore Campus alone, along with significant mixed-use developments on the Water Tower Campus. Today, Loyola ranks among the top 104 universities in the nation, and is in the midst of over $800 million in capital construction projects. In 2015, the university established Arrupe College, a uniquely structured two- year college designed to give low-income students access to a Loyola education. On May 23, 2016, Loyola named Jo Ann Rooney its 24th president. She is the first female president in the history of the university.  Campuses  = Lake Shore Campus = Cudahy LibraryLoyola's flagship Lake Shore Campus is along the shores of Lake Michigan in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods on the north side of Chicago, eight miles north of the Loop. Founded in 1912, it is the primary residential campus for the school, and is the home of the College of Arts and Sciences, and a variety of graduate programs. A collection of over forty buildings, the campus offers ample green space and lakeshore access, as well as several landmarks: The Madonna della Strada Chapel, a striking Art Deco masterpiece completed in 1939, is the center of Loyola's religious life. The Mundelein Center, a 200-foot tall Art Deco skyscraper completed in 1930, is the home of Loyola's fine and performing arts programs and a National Historical Landmark. The Joseph J. Gentile Arena, which holds 5,500 for basketball, volleyball, and campus events, was recently expanded to include the Norville Center, a student-athlete academic center and home of Rambler athletics. One of the largest events held annually in Gentile Arena is Colossus, which features a musical artist and comedian. Artists including Jason Derulo and John Mulaney have performed for Colossus. The Halas Recreation Center was remodeled and incorporated into the sprawling new Damen Student Center, the heart of campus social life. Cudahy Science Hall The E.M. Cudahy Memorial Library contains over 900,000 volumes and 3,600 periodical subscriptions, and in 2008 was expanded to include the Information Commons, an academic and social space with glass curtain walls that offer unparalleled views of the lake and campus. Science education and research takes place in the Quinlan Life Sciences building and the Institute of Environmental Sustainability, a multipurpose complex that includes academic space, a residence hall, a greenhouse, and the largest geothermal energy facility in Chicago. The Lake Shore Campus is connected to the famous Chicago 'L' via the Loyola station on the CTA Red Line. Southbound Red Line trains pass through neighborhoods such as Lake View and Lincoln Park on the way to the Loop and South Side, while northbound Purple Line trains connect to Evanston, the home of Northwestern University. Information Commons  Sustainability  Loyola is committed to creating environmentally sustainable campuses, and various efforts have reduced university energy use by 33% since 1998. Loyola has three LEED Silver certified buildings and four LEED Gold certified buildings, with all future construction to be LEED certified as well. Loyola has more green roofs than any college in the Midwest, which includes both new and renovated buildings. These efforts have not gone unnoticed: in 2014, Loyola placed 4th nationally (and 1st in Illinois) in the Sierra Club's ranking of America's Greenest Colleges. = Water Tower Campus = The Water Tower Campus opened in 1949 along a stretch of Michigan Avenue today known as the Magnificent Mile, and is named after the Chicago Water Tower, a city landmark that survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It is the home of the Quinlan School of Business, the School of Law, the School of Education, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, the School of Social Work, the School of Communication, the Institute of Pastoral Studies, and Arrupe College, as well as a selection of classes from programs based elsewhere. The Chicago Water Tower, a city landmark and the downtown campus namesake Dominated by mixed-use skyscrapers, campus buildings include the Corboy Law Center, Terry Student Center, Baumhart Hall, and landmark Lewis Towers, built in 1945 as the Illinois Catholic Women's Club and today home of the Office of the President and the Loyola University Museum of Art. Recent construction includes The Clare, a 587-foot tower that serves as both a retirement community and the home of the College of Communication, and the LEED certified John and Kathy Schreiber Center, which opened in 2015 as the new home of the Quinlan School of Business. The campus puts students at the heart of Chicago's business and cultural life: it is steps from the offices of major corporations, Chicago's premiere retail and tourist district, as well as institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Newberry Library. Holy Name Cathedral, the seat of the Archdiocese of Chicago, is directly adjacent to the south. The Water Tower Campus is also connected to the 'L' via the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line. Students can conveniently travel between Water Tower Campus and Lakeshore Campus on a school-sponsored shuttle during the week. = Health Sciences Campus = Founded in 1969 along with the Loyola University Medical Center, the Health Sciences Campus is the home of the Stritch School of Medicine, the Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, and several programs that are part of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. It is in Maywood, an immediate western suburb of Chicago, approximately eleven miles from the Loop. A leading academic center for teaching and research, Loyola University Medical Center comprises the main hospital, Loyola Outpatient Center, Ronald McDonald Children's Hospital, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, and several medical office and laboratory buildings. In 2011, the medical center was sold to Trinity Health, while Loyola continues to own and operate the academic buildings and select research facilities on campus. In 2017, Loyola expanded its accelerated nursing program to an online-based format with lab in Downer's Grove. = John Felice Rome Center = Loyola's permanent campus in Rome opened in 1962 at Casa Italiana Viaggi Internazionali Studenti (C.I.V.I.S.), a dormitory originally built to host athletes during the 1960 Summer Olympics. In 1978, the campus moved to its current location on Monte Mario approximately two miles northwest of the Vatican City. The campus is the home of the oldest American university program in Italy, and hosts students from both Loyola and other universities seeking to study abroad. In 2005, the campus was renamed in honor of founder and Director Emeritus John P. Felice. = Additional campuses = In 2010, Loyola founded the Retreat and Ecology Campus on the former site of the Resurrection Retreat Center in Woodstock, Illinois, an outer suburb approximately fifty miles northwest of Chicago. The campus houses the university's campus ministry programs, and offers a unique learning opportunity for students and faculty interested in the sciences. The property contains of natural habitat that includes ponds, streams, woods, and prairieland. Loyola also owns and operates the Cuneo Mansion and Gardens in suburban Vernon Hills, Illinois, approximately thirty miles north of Chicago. The mansion and grounds were donated to the university in 2009 by the John and Herta Cuneo Foundation. The estate operates as a museum and hosts special events and a growing number of academic programs in business, education and law.

A statue of Ignatius of Loyola was dedicated in 2000 and was relocated to the lobby of the Information Commons. = Religious education = Religious education is still one of Loyola's hallmarks as it was home to the now-closed Saint Joseph College Seminary as well as the Jesuit First Studies program. Loyola's First Studies Program is one of three in the country, with Fordham University and Saint Louis University housing the other two. During this three-year period, Jesuit Scholastics and Brothers generally study philosophy and some theology. First Studies is one part of an eleven-year formation process toward the Jesuit priesthood. This program is administered by the Chicago Province Society of Jesus. Saint Joseph College Seminary served the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago and provided vocational training to candidates of diocesan priesthood. Loyola University also provided rigorous religious education for those seeking careers in lay ministry with the Loyola University Institute of Pastoral Studies as well as degree opportunities in interdisciplinary Catholic studies. Loyola's Department of Theology also offers undergraduate and graduate courses in the study of systematic theology, ethics, and Biblical studies, offering a diverse set of classes that are not limited to religious studies in a Catholic context. = Schools and colleges = Loyola Chicago is composed of the following schools and colleges: * College of Arts & Sciences * Quinlan School of Business * School of Communication * School of Continuing and Professional Studies * School of Education * The Graduate School * School of Law * Stritch School of Medicine * Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing * School of Social Work * Arrupe College * Institute of Environmental Sustainability *Institute of Pastoral Studies  Student life  = Residential life = Most of the residence halls and apartments managed by Loyola's Department of Residence Life are in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods surrounding the Lake Shore Campus. One, Baumhart Hall, is at the Water Tower Campus on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. Most of Loyola's residence halls are named after other Jesuit colleges and universities. First-year students may live in one of the following residences on the Lake Shore campus: Campion Hall (for first year students of the Interdisciplinary Honors Program), de Nobili Hall, Mertz Hall, Regis Hall, San Francisco Hall, and the Simpson Living Learning Center (Simpson Hall). Simpson, Mertz, and de Nobili Halls are conveniently located above dining halls that serve these buildings and the halls surrounding them. Residence halls on the north side of campus are served by a dining hall and food court in the Damen Student Center. First- and second-year students are required to live in on-campus housing. Upperclass students are permitted to choose from fifteen residences at the Lake Shore campus: Bellarmine, Canisius, Fairfield, Fordham, Georgetown, LeMoyne, Marquette, Marquette South, Messina, Regis, Saint Louis, Santa Clara, Seattle, Spring Hill and Xavier Halls. Santa Clara Hall is on Loyola Avenue right on Lake Michigan. Upperclassmen can also choose to live in Baumhart Hall, located at 26 E. Pearson, just a block from the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago. It is a 25-floor apartment-style residence for upperclassmen and graduate students at Loyola University. Students living in Baumhart and taking classes on the Water Tower Campus have access to two dining facilities: Nina's Cafe (in the Corboy Law Center) and LU's Old-Fashioned Deli and Pub (in the Terry Student Center). = Greek life = Loyola University Chicago is home to several Greek letter organizations.

The teams include men and women's basketball, cross country, men and women's golf, men and women's soccer, softball, track, and men and women's volleyball. The nickname \\"Ramblers\\" was first applied to Loyola's football team in 1926 because they frequently traveled throughout the United States. LU Wolf is the mascot for the University. He was inspired by the coat- of-arms of St. Ignatius of Loyola, from whom Loyola derives its name, which depicts two wolves standing over a kettle. Taken from the heraldic crest carved in the lintel on St. Ignatius' family home in Azpeitia, Spain, the wolves and cauldron refer to the prosperity and generosity of the Loyola family, who, after feeding family, retainers and soldiers, had enough food to feed even the wild animals. Loyola's men's basketball team, the Ramblers, won the 1963 national championship. Loyola is the only Division I NCAA school in Illinois to have won a national title in men's basketball. In 2018 they finished the NCAA tournament with the all-time highest win percentage of any team to have ever competed in the tournament. Loyola placed slightly ahead of Duke University. The Loyola Ramblers men's volleyball team won back-to-back NCAA championships in 2014 and 2015. In 2018, Loyola's men's basketball team won the Missouri Valley Conference tournament championship to qualify for the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament for the first time since 1985. The 11-seed Ramblers recorded four straight upset victories against the Miami Hurricanes, Tennessee Volunteers, Nevada Wolf Pack, and Kansas State Wildcats to advance to the Final Four. However, the Michigan Wolverines defeated Loyola in the Final Four. The publicity surrounding Loyola's tournament run generated an estimated $300 million in publicity for the school. In October 2018, the Loyola Ramblers Women's Soccer team won the Missouri Valley Conference regular season title with 6‚Äì1 win over Evansville. The win gave the Ramblers their first Missouri Valley Conference regular season title in program history.

A metal ball (C) charged with static electricity can be lowered into the pail on a nonconducting silk thread. A gold-leaf electroscope (E), a sensitive detector of electric charge, is attached by a wire to the outside of the pail. When the charged ball is lowered into the pail without touching it, the electroscope registers a charge, indicating that the ball induces charge in the metal container by electrostatic induction. An opposite charge is induced on the inside surface of the pail. Faraday's ice pail experiment is a simple electrostatics experiment performed in 1843 by British scientist Michael Faraday that demonstrates the effect of electrostatic induction on a conducting container. For a container, Faraday used a metal pail made to hold ice, which gave the experiment its name.John Ambrose Fleming, The experiment shows that an electric charge enclosed inside a conducting shell induces an equal charge on the shell, and that in an electrically conducting body, the charge resides entirely on the surface. It also demonstrates the principles behind electromagnetic shielding such as employed in the Faraday cage. The ice pail experiment was the first precise quantitative experiment on electrostatic charge. It is still used today in lecture demonstrations and physics laboratory courses to teach the principles of electrostatics. Description of experiment Faraday's description of the experiment, from a letter he wrote on February 4, 1843 to Richard Phillips, the editor of Philosophical Journal, and published in the March 1844 issue: \\"Let A in the diagram represent an insulated pewter ice-pail...connected by a wire to a delicate gold-leaf electrometer E, and let C be a round brass ball insulated by a dry thread of white silk, three or four feet in length, so as to remove the influence of the hand holding it from the ice-pail below. Let A be perfectly discharged, and then let C be charged at a distance by a [electrostatic] machine or Leyden jar, and introduced into A.. If C be positive, E will also diverge positively; if C be taken away, E will collapse perfectly... As C enters the vessel A the divergence of E will increase until C is ... below the edge of the vessel, and will remain quite steady and unchanged for any greater depression. This shows that at that distance the inductive action of C is entirely exerted upon the interior of A, ... If C is made to touch the bottom of A, all of its charge is communicated to A, ... and C, upon being withdrawn, ... is found to be perfectly discharged.\\" Below is a detailed modern description of the experimental procedure: #The experiment uses a conductive metal container A open at the top, insulated from the ground. Faraday employed a 7 in. diameter by 10.5 in. tall pewter pail on a wooden stool,(B) but modern demonstrations often use a hollow metal sphere with a hole in the top, or a cylinder of metal screen, mounted on an insulating stand. Its outside surface is connected by a wire to a sensitive electric charge detector. Faraday used a gold-leaf electroscope, but modern demonstrations often use a modern electrometer because it is far more sensitive than an electroscope, can distinguish between positive and negative charge, and gives a quantitative readout., p.4-5 The container is discharged by connecting it briefly to a large conducting object, called a ground (earth); this can be done by touching it with a finger, using the conductive human body as a ground. Any initial charge drains off into the ground. The charge detector reads zero, indicating that the container has no charge. #A metal object C (Faraday used a brass ball suspended by a nonconductive silk thread, but modern experiments often use a small metal ball or disk mounted on an insulating handle) is charged with electricity using an electrostatic machine and lowered into the container A without touching it . As it is lowered the charge detector's reading increases, indicating that the outside of the container is becoming charged. Once the object is well inside the lip of the container the charge detector levels off and registers a constant charge, even if the object is lowered further. The charge on the outside of the container is the same polarity as that on the object. If the charge detector is touched to the inside surface of the container, it is found to be charged with opposite polarity. For example, if the object C has a positive charge, the outside of the container A will be found to have a positive charge, while the inside of the container has a negative charge. #If the object C is moved about inside the container without touching the walls, the charge detector's reading will not change, indicating that the charge on the outside of the container is not affected by where the charged object is inside the container. #If the charged object C is lifted out of the container again, the charge detector will decrease to zero again. This shows the charges on the container were induced by C, and the container has no net charge. Therefore, the opposite charges induced on the inside and the outside must be equal in size. #The charged object C is touched to the inside of the container. The charge detector reading does not change. However, if the object is now withdrawn from the container, the reading stays the same, indicating that the container now has a net charge. If the object is then tested with the charge detector, it is found to be completely uncharged, and the inside of the container is also found to be uncharged. This indicates that all the charge on C has been transferred to the container, and has exactly neutralized the opposite charge on the inside surface of the container, leaving only the charge on the outside. So the charge on the inside of the container was exactly equal to the charge on C. Kits are available from educational supply firms containing all the apparatus needed for students to perform the experiment. =Preventing error due to stray charges= Stray static electric charges on the experimenter's body, clothes, or nearby apparatus, as well as AC electric fields from mains-powered equipment, can induce additional charges on parts of the container or charged object C, giving a false reading. The success of the experiment often requires precautions to eliminate these extraneous charges: *Any charges on the container and nearby conductive objects should be removed before the experiment by grounding (earthing); touching them briefly to some large conducting object called a ground. Any charge on the object will flow into the ground due to its mutual repulsion. This can be accomplished by touching them with a finger, using the conductive human body as a ground. However the experimenter's body itself should be grounded frequently by touching a good metal ground such as a metal workbench, or preferably a water pipe or the grounding wire of the building's mains power wiring. Ideally the experimenter's body should be grounded throughout the experiment. Some demonstration kits include conductive ground sheets which are laid on the workbench under the apparatus, and antistatic wrist straps the experimenter wears during the experiment, which are connected to a good ground. *The electrometer measures charge with respect to ground, so it requires a connection to ground during use. It has a ground wire, usually colored black, ending in a clip which should be attached to a metal ground during use. *The experimenter should avoid excessive movement during the experiment. Walking around or waving his/her arms can cause the buildup of static charges on clothing. The experimenter should hold the handle of the charged object C as far from the object and the container as possible when lowering the object into the container. *In professional student laboratory kits, the container A is often in the form of two concentric cylinders of metal screen, open at the top. A screen acts the same as a solid metal sheet for electrostatic charge, as long as its holes are small. The inner cylinder is the Faraday pail container itself, separated from the outer cylinder with insulating supports. The outer cylindrical metal screen surrounds the inner, and acts as a ground to shield it from stray charges. This design largely eliminates the stray charge problem, as well as allowing the experimenter to see inside the container. The electrometer ground lead is clipped to the outer ground screen, and the experimenter touches this screen while performing any procedure. To ground the inner screen, the experimenter can bridge his finger between the inner and outer screens. When doing this it is important that he lift his finger first from the inner screen, not the outer, to avoid leaving charge on the inner screen. *Charge can leak off the charged object C and the container along handles and supports due to surface layers of dirt and oil from fingerprints. If this is suspected the equipment should be washed with detergent to remove oils and dried. * When measuring the charge on the inside or outside surface of the container, the charge detector should not be touched to the surface near the lip of the container. Extra charge concentrates near the edge of the opening due to the geometry of the metal. Explanation Drawing of the electric field lines as the charged ball is lowered into the container (A,B). When the charge is far enough inside (C), all the electric field lines terminate on the inside of the container, inducing an equal charge there. When the ball is touched to the inside of the container (D), all the charge moves to the pail. Conductive metal objects contain mobile electric charges (electrons) that can move about freely in the metal. In an uncharged state, each part of the metal contains equal quantities of positive and negative charges, intimately mixed, so no part of it has a net charge. If an external charged object is brought near a piece of metal, the force of the charge causes these internal charges to separate. The charges of opposite polarity to the external charge are attracted to it, and move to the surface of the object facing the charge. The charges of the same polarity are repelled and move to the surface of the metal away from the charge. This is called electrostatic induction. In Procedure 2 above, as the charge C is lowered into the container, the charges in the metal of the container separate. If C has a positive charge, the negative charges in the metal are attracted to it and move to the inner surface of the container, while the positive charges are repelled and move to the outside surface. If C has a negative charge, the charges have opposite polarity. Since the container was originally uncharged, the two regions have equal and opposite charges. The induction process is reversible: in Procedure 4, when C is removed, the attraction of the opposite charges cause them to intermingle again, and the charge on the surfaces reduces to zero. It is the electrostatic field of the charged object C which causes the mobile charges to move. As the charges in the metal separate, the resulting regions of induced charge on the surfaces of the metal container create their own electrostatic field, which opposes the field from C. The field of the induced charges exactly cancels the field from C throughout the interior of the metal. The electrostatic field inside a piece of metal is always zero. If it was not, the force of the field would cause more motion of charges and more charge separation, until the electric field became zero. Once C is well inside the container, almost all of the electric field lines from C strike the container surface. The result (proved below) is that the total charge induced on the inside of the container is equal to the charge on C. In Procedure 5, when C is touched to the container's inner wall, all the charge on C flows out and neutralizes the induced charge, leaving both the inner wall and C uncharged. The container is left with the charge on its outside. The net effect is that all the charge that was previously on C is now on the outside of the container. An important conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the net charge inside a closed conducting container is always zero, even if a charged object is put in. If the charge inside can find a conducting path to the container wall, it will flow to the outside surface of the container due to its mutual repulsion. If it cannot, the interior charge will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inside surface, so the net charge inside is still zero. Any net charge on a conducting object is located on its surface. =Proof induced charge is equal to object's charge= The gaussian surface S (green) The result found in Procedure 5, that a charged object enclosed in a metal container induces an equal charge on the container, can be proved using Gauss's law. Assume the container A completely encloses the object C, without an opening (this assumption is explained below), and that C has a charge of Q coulombs. The electric field of the charge C will cause the charges in the volume of the metal to separate, creating regions of induced charge on the inside and outside surfaces of the shell. Now imagine a closed surface S inside the metal of the shell, between the inside and outside surfaces. Since S is in a conducting region (inside the volume of metal) where the electric field is zero, the electric field everywhere on the surface S is zero. Therefore, the total electric flux through the surface S must be zero. Therefore, from Gauss's law the total electric charge inside the surface S must be zero: :iintlimits_S mathbf{E} cdot dmathbf{A} = frac{1}{epsilon_0}(Q + Q_{induced}) = 0 , The only charges inside S are the charge Q on the object C, and the induced charge Qinduced on the inside surface of the metal. Since the sum of these two charges is zero, the induced charge on the inside surface of the shell must have an equal but opposite value to the charge on C: Qinduced = ‚àíQ. =Explanation using electric field lines= Another way to see that the enclosed charge induces an equal charge in the container is to use the visualization device of electric field lines. Electric field lines terminate on equal charges; that is each line begins on a specific quantity of positive charge, and ends on an equal quantity of negative charge. An additional fact needed is that electric field lines cannot penetrate conductors; if an electric field line penetrated into a volume of metal, the electrons in the metal would flow along the field line, redistributing the charge in the conductor until no electric field was left. Only when the electric field in the conductor is zero can the charges in the conductor be at electrostatic equilibrium. When the charged object C is enclosed inside the conductive container A. all the field lines extending from the object must terminate on the inside surface of the container; there is nowhere else for them to go. Since each unit of charge on the object originates a field line, which ends on an equal induced charge on the container, the total charge on the object and the induced charge on the container's interior must be equal. A charged object outside any container also induces an equal charge on its surroundings. The field lines extending from it end on charges induced in the walls or other objects in the room. This illustrates the general principle that for every positive charge, there must be a corresponding negative charge somewhere in the universe. =The effect of the hole= Strictly speaking, for the induced charge on the container to exactly equal the charge on the object, the metal container must completely enclose the charged object, without a hole. If there is an opening, some of the electric field lines from C will pass through the opening, and therefore will not induce an opposite charge on the container, so the charge on the container's surfaces will be less than the charge on C. But an opening is necessary to get the charged object in and out. In his experiment, Faraday closed the opening by attaching the metal lid of the pail to the thread suspending the ball, so when the ball was lowered to the center of the container the lid covered the opening. However this is not necessary. The experiment works very well even for containers with large uncovered openings, like Faraday's pail. As long as it is deep enough, and the depth of C inside the container is greater than the diameter of the opening, the induced charge will be very close in value to the charge on C. As the drawing above shows, once the charged object is well inside, most of the electric field lines originating on the charge C end on the container walls, so very few of them pass through the opening to end on negative charges that are not located on the container. John Ambrose Fleming, a prominent early electrical researcher, wrote in 1911: But the experiment is often explained, as in the above sections, by assuming the container has no hole. =Electrostatic shielding= Since there is no electric field in the intervening volume of the metal, the charge distribution on the outside surface of the container and its electric field is completely unaffected by the charges inside the container. If the charged object inside the container is moved about as in Procedure 3, the induced charge distribution on the inside surface will redistribute itself, maintaining the cancellation of the electric fields outside the inner surface. So the charges on the outside surface will be completely unaffected, along with any charges in the outside world. From the outside, the metal container acts exactly like it simply has a surface charge +Q, with no charges inside. Similarly, if an external charge is brought near the container from outside, the induced charge distribution on the outside surface will redistribute to cancel its electric field inside the container. So the charges inside the container will not \\"feel\\" any electric field and will not change. In summary, the regions inside and outside of the container are electrically isolated from each other, electric fields from one region cannot penetrate or affect the other. This is the principle of electrostatic shielding used in the Faraday cage. Further experiments =Alternate procedure= An alternate way of conducting the experiment: after the charged object C is lowered into the container in Procedure 2, the outside surface of the container is momentarily grounded. The charge on the outside of the container all drains off to ground, and the charge detector declines to zero, leaving the charge on the inside of the container, equal but opposite to that on C. Then the object C is removed from the container. Since C is no longer present to hold the induced charge on the inside surface of the container, it migrates to the outside of the container. so the charge detector registers an equal but opposite charge from its previous reading. This new charge can be proved to be equal and opposite to the charge on C by touching C to the exterior surface of the container. The two charges exactly neutralize each other, so both the exterior of the container and C are found to be uncharged. =Noncontact charge measurement= Lowering an object into a Faraday container offers a way to measure the charge on it without touching it or disturbing its charge. The charge induced on the outside of the container by charges inside it depends only on the total charge inside. If several charged objects are lowered into the container, the charge on the outside will be equal to their sum. =Charge addition= If several conducting charged objects are lowered one after the other into the container and touched to the inside, all the charge on each object will be transferred to the outside of the container, regardless of how much charge is already on the container. This is the only way electrostatic charges on objects can be added together. If two conducting charged objects are simply touched together on their outside surfaces, the charge on both will merely be shared between the two objects. This is how charge is transferred to the top terminal of a Van de Graaff generator. The terminal is a hollow metal shell and functions as a Faraday pail. Charge is transported inside it on a moving belt, then removed from the belt by a wire attached to the inside of the terminal. Since the inside of the terminal is at a constant potential, the charge from the belt flows to the outside surface, adding to the charge there, regardless of how much charge is already on the terminal. =Contact electrification produces equal charges= The \\"charge summing\\" property of Faraday's pail can be used to prove that contact electrification (triboelectricity), charging objects by rubbing or touching them together, produces equal and opposite charges. A piece of fur and a piece of rubber or plastic are first discharged so they have no charge, then both are lowered together into the container attached to nonconductive handles. The charge detector registers no charge. Then they are rubbed together inside the container. The rubbing will cause the fur to become positively charged and the rubber to become negatively charged due to the triboelectric effect. However, since this is due to a separation of equal charges, the two charges are equal and opposite, so the sum of the charge on both objects is still zero. This is proven by the charge detector, which continues to read zero after the operation. The charges on the individual objects can be demonstrated by removing one at a time from the container. The charge detector will register opposite charges for each remaining object. =Multiple concentric containers= In his original 1844 paper, Faraday also investigated the effect of using several conducting containers one inside the other. He found that the induction effect works through multiple containers the same way it does through one container. He used four pails, each supported on a nonconductive pad inside the next. If a charge is lowered into the innermost pail, an exactly equal induced charge will appear on the outside of the outer pail. The charge on the outside of each pail induces an equal charge on the next. If one of the pails is grounded, the charge on all the pails outside it goes to zero.

Biography Born on 14 October 1926, Sargent was educated at Bedford School and at Imperial College London where he received a BSc and a PhD in chemical engineering. He worked for Air Liquide in Paris as a practising engineer until 1959 when he returned to the UK and subsequently joined Imperial College as a lecturer. He described those war years and post-war France in his address to the University of Edinburgh. His career advanced and he was made Courtaulds professor of Chemical engineering at Imperial College London between 1966 and 1992, Dean of the City and Guilds College from 1973 to 1976, head of the Department of Chemical Engineering from 1975 to 1988 and director of the Centre for Process Systems Engineering (which he founded) from its launch in August 1989 until his retirement in 1992, when he became a senior research fellow and emeritus professor in the centre and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Engineering. Sargent passed away on 11 September 2018.Roger Sargent 1926‚Äì2018https://doi.org/10.3390/pr8040405 Chemical engineering Roger Sargent became a professor at Imperial College at an important point in the development of his profession. He was very aware of this, and that his experience of eight years as a practising engineer at Air Liquide in Paris gave him a particular insight into how the subject should be taught: > \\"the concept of the engineer that I have been trying to build up, and it is > precisely the combination of a high degree of competence, and the > quantitative approach, with a wider social consciousness and the ability to > view problems in their context, that is so valuable\\" (Inaugural Lecture, > 1963). In particular he was vigorous in promoting that the operation and control of a chemical plant were important and worthy subjects to be taught (previously these had been thought to be the responsibility of semi-skilled operators,not professional engineers), and that the new computers and numerical methods should be fundamental to undergraduate chemical engineering education (this was in 1963). He always pushed for the highest degree of competence in all his students; the computer was never to be used as a way of avoiding important issues: > \\"they must learn the common standard techniques and know something of such > questions as rounding errors, stability, and rate of convergence. To achieve > even such slight understanding of numerical matters requires a strong > foundation of the more classical branches of mathematics, particularly in > the various kinds of linear algebra which have always formed the backbone of > engineering mathematics courses ‚Äî but of course, these must be oriented > towards the purpose of the engineer, which is ultimately to produce an > answer in terms of number.\\" (Inaugural Lecture, 1963) Process systems engineering He is known principally as one of the earliest creators of the discipline of Process Systems Engineering, and his influence has been extremely widely spread among that community, by his research and also by his extraordinarily large family tree (Academic genealogy) of research students. In his career at Imperial College he supervised 61 research students, and several of these first-generation students have gone on to establish large research schools of their own. By 2008, this family tree extended to seven generations and 639 students and former students.http://titan.engr.tamu.edu/Sargent_tree/ Since 1994 his influence is commemorated in the annual \\"Roger Sargent\\" lectures at Imperial College. Sargent is regarded as the \\"father\\" of Process Systems Engineering (PSE). Through his academic and research activities Sargent built up a school of PSE that is now widely spread all over the world. His contributions to the area are known worldwide and considered important pillars to the PSE area adding up to a collection of outstanding achievements over the last 50 years. It is only when we learn of those whose academic origins can be traced back to Sargent, do we realise the full contribution he has already made, not only through his own work, but by instilling his enthusiasm for excellence into those who later have taken up the challenge. The interests of this group are reflections of Sargent's focus on process modelling, simulation, optimisation and control, a field, which is now called PSE. Sargent's vision, leadership and guidance has led the establishment of PSE as the development of systematic techniques for process modelling, design, and control. His software \\"SPEEDUP\\" (Simulation Programme for the Economic Evaluation and Design of Unsteady-State Processes) was first described in publication in 1964, and this package was widely used in research and industry more than 25 years later. Professional affiliations Sargent distinguished himself as an active member of several national and international corporations, namely the Institution of Chemical Engineers, which he joined in 1960 and where he became a president in 1973, and also the Science Research Council, the Council of Engineering Institutions, the European Federation of Chemical Engineering, the Ministry of Technology, the Department of Trade and Industry, the University Grants Committee, the University Funding Council, the British Council and the British-French Mixed Cultural Commission, amongst others, where he acted as a member of several boards and committees.

It was built by an early settler of the area during the Revolutionary War. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally built in the Georgian-influenced American Colonial style, it later acquired some Federal style decoration, particularly on the interior. The lunette windows on the second story may have been added later, after their use on a now-demolished local hotel. Despite later modifications, it is the only house from that era remaining in the town that has a gambrel roof. It remains a private residence. Building The house and its outbuildings and dependencies, none of which are considered contributing resources to the Register listing, are located on a three-acre () lot on the northern corner of the three-way intersection, a quarter-mile (400 m) from the Ossining village line. The surrounding area has many other houses, all of more modern construction, on similarly large lots. It remains heavily wooded; a golf course is located a short distance to the north. Among the trees on the lot are some species rare in the area, native to the Far East. The surrounding terrain is gently rolling. At the intersection Pinesbridge follows high ground between two swampy areas. The lot therefore slopes toward Oliver Pond to the northwest. =Exterior= A driveway from the intersection provides parking between the house and a former barn to the south, now used as a garage. The house itself is a one-and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay wood frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. It is sided in clapboard on all but the north (rear) elevation and topped with a gambrel roof shingled in wood. Brick chimneys pierce it at either end. On the ground level of the south (front) facade, the main entrance is centrally located. It is sheltered by a modern awning. The two side bays have plain window surrounds with projecting lintels. They are set with six-over-six double-hung sash windows and paneled wooden shutters with wrought iron hardware. A row of shrubs in front provides further shielding. All five bays of the second floor are set with lunette windows with simple tracery. They have plain molded surrounds. Above them is a shallow molded cornice and copper rain gutter. The north elevation, divided into three bays, is faced in wood shingles rather than clapboards. In the center of the ground floor, the rear entrance is a Dutch door with twelve lights in the upper section and paneling in the lower. On its east is a casement window, set with five eight-light panels. The western bay has a small square window and a ribbon of five single-light casement windows. The second floor has six-over- six double-hung sash over the entrance flanked by triple-paneled eight-light casement. The east and west facades are differently fenestrated. The former has one nine-over-six double-hung sash on either side of the first floor, four regularly spaced six-over-six double-hung sash on the second, and two six- light casements in the gambrel apex at the attic level. The foundation is partly exposed on this side. On the west the windows are more idiosyncratic. To the north on the first floor is a ribbon of four six-light casement, and on the south a 12-over-eight double-hung sash. There are only two six-over-six sashes on the second story, both close to the ends. At the attic the windows are the same as the opposite end. The foundation is exposed enough at the center to allow for a basement entrance and window. =Interior= A millstone now serves as the doorstep for the main entrance, an eight-paneled door in a paneled reveal. It has sidelights, glazed on top and paneled below, flanked by pilasters topped with block capitals. It opens into the central hallway through an entryway framed by post and lintel boxed beams. Along with the center hall, the interior mostly retains its original four-on-four floor plan and many original finishes. That includes exposed heavy timber framing, wide floorboards and working fireplaces, with all but one having chimneys in the original diagonal configuration, as well as much vernacular Federal style woodwork. Most prominent among that is the fireplace in the front room on the east. Its mantelpiece has a surround featuring pilasters with square capitals and a frieze with floral motif. There is a large opening between it and the back room on that side, while the two rooms on the west remain entirely separate. A simple staircase with square balusters, turned newel post and molded rail rises from the central hall to the second story. The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. A door in the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed. Modern metal suspension rods have been added to support the ceiling, and one of the original wooden tie beams has been replaced with a metal one. In the basement, hand-hewn columns support the main beam and chimneys. Flat-arched structures at the bottom have openings used as storage bins. The floor is concrete. History Throughout the 18th century, northern Westchester County was mostly divided into large farms, while the county's southern portion was more densely populated, with the larger villages. It is believed that one such farm was the hundred-acre (40 ha) farm that includes the house property. No record of its purchase exists, but later records show Arthur Williams, upon his appointment as a town assessor in 1803 and later as the district's highway master, as living at the property and suggesting he had done so for a long time. His family had been in the region since the 17th century; he very likely built the house. Its design reflects the architectural influences that prevailed from the middle of the century through American independence. Migrants from New England had begun settling in the Hudson Valley, bringing with them a preferred vernacular building form of a rectangular one-and-a-half-story house of local material with gambrel roof. Inside the prevalent Georgian influences were more marked: a center-hall, four-over-four floor plan and balanced facade. Many houses like the Williams house, which may originally also have included a rear porch, were built through the 1820s. In the early 1800s, Arthur's son William inherited the property. In his primary profession of sea captain he traveled extensively, bringing back specimens of Far Eastern trees which he planted around the property. On his breaks, he was the local public school inspector. After his death on one of his voyages, in 1826, the farm passed to his daughter Georgianna. Around that time the house was first modified. The Federal style was in ascendance, and builders were often asked to copy the similar Adamesque mode popular in Britain for the preceding half-century. Many existing buildings were altered to add some elements of those newer styles. One such change, the lunette windows, was common, and thus the windows on the second story of the house's south facade were duly altered. The change may have been inspired by the Union Hotel (no longer extant) in downtown Ossining, which had a similar row of lunettes. Georgianna Williams married Lawrence DuBois, descended from a family of Belgian Huguenots who extensively settled the central region of the valley. Her husband primarily farmed the land; he also served in the same position as highway master that his wife's grandfather had held. They had two children. Their son, William, inherited the property. In 1864 he married Sarah Washburn, a member of a prominent Ossining-area family. During their ownership, the rear porch was installed, possibly replacing an original. A front porch was definitely installed. Both had a shed roof supported by brackets. William and Sarah had eight children, but after her death in 1926, none of them would inherit the farm. Instead, her husband sold the property to a local developer. By that time the growth of the railroad, and the early development of the county's parkway network had brought suburbanization to northern Westchester. Large farms like the one that had been in the family for a century and a half were slowly disappearing, and after the sale the Williams‚ÄìDuBois farm joined them, subdivided into the smaller, purely residential lots that exist today. The house has been through several different owners since that subdivision, some of whom have made some changes. In 1940 the porches were removed, replaced with a patio in the rear and the millstone in front, and a large entryway cut inside between the east rooms on the first floor. Later owners have respected the house as part of the county's history; however sometime between the Register listing and 2009 the portions of the chimneys originally exposed on the exterior's first story have been covered in clapboard.

The first meeting was held at the Royal Exchange, Dublin, on 10 November 1806, with Lord Belvedere in the chair.Brief Memorials of the Rev. B.W. Mathias, late chaplain of Bethesda Chapel It was founded by the Rev. Benjamin Williams Mathias (1772‚Äì1841), a leading figure in the evangelical movement in the Church of Ireland and others. On behalf of the society, Mathias travelled widely throughout the country, and he was a founder member of the Hibernian Church Missionary Society (1814) for evangelism overseas. A large number of Auxiliary Societies were established throughout Ireland in the decades following its founding. Rev. Dr. John H Singer served as secretary. In 1812, the Ladies' Auxiliary Bible Society was set up in Dublin, in order to contribute to the society's work. This included such luminaries of the time as the Viscountesses of Lorton and Lifford, Countesses of Meath, Westmeath, and Leitrim, and Ladies Castlecoote and Molyneux. It was stressed how important it was that all duties attached to the Ladies' Auxiliary should be regulated with more than ordinary regard to propriety and decorum. Within a few years, the ladies in Ireland had set up 71 auxiliaries, 331 branches and 203 associations.John Owen - History of the British and Foreign Bible Society At its founding, the society was supported by the bishops of Dublin and Tuam. It was expected that it should confine itself to the task of circulating the Scriptures, without note or comment. In some quarters, the methods of the society failed to commend themselves to Churchmen of the Church of Ireland. Remonstrances were made from time to time, and animated discussions took place both in the committee and at the public meetings of the society. In the opinion of O'Beirne, Bishop of Meath, \\"the management of the Hibernian Bible Society has entirely fallen into the hands of sectaries and seceders, and the establishment of their auxiliary societies, wherever it takes place through the country, has for its immediate object the increase of the number of their proselytes, and the extension and prevalence of their doctrines.\\"History of the Diocese of Meath, volume 2, p 160Charles Stokes Dudley: An Analysis of the System of the Bible Society With the Belfast Bible Society becoming independent and forming the Northern Ireland Bible Society in 1987, The Hibernian Bible Society changed its name to the Bible Society of Ireland and it changed again in 1989 to the National Bible Society of Ireland,NBSI Annual Report 1991-1992 National Bible Society of Ireland. and is member of the United Bible Societies since 1949.

It is a wood frame structure dating to the 1870s. In 1989 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. At the time the house was built, Ossining was beginning its transition from a country town to a commuter suburb of New York City. The Austin House is one of the few from that period of the community's history to remain completely intact, both outside and in, although two extensions were added in the 20th century. It is currently the home of the Ossining Historical Society, which operates a museum in the building. Building and grounds The house is located on a half-acre () lot at the east corner of Croton and Bradshaw Drive, a short cul-de-sac in eastern Ossining. To the west and southwest is Roosevelt School, a public elementary school. Across the street, on the north side of Croton, is Ossining Gospel Assembly of God Church. East, across Bradshaw, are 20th-century houses, which otherwise predominate in this section of the village. The terrain is a level area between low hills on the east and west. A group of mature shade trees buffer the lot along Croton. From the corner a driveway leads to a small parking lot south of the house. A flagpole is on the front lawn. A display case on the property holds an old farm wagon and an original mile marker from the Albany Post Road. These are not considered to contribute to the site's historic character. However, a well in the south yard, now covered by a large block of slate, is believed to be original to the property, and is thus the only other contributing resource to the house's Register listing. =Exterior= The main block of the house is a two-and-a-half-story, rectangular, three-bay gable-roofed wood frame structure on a brick and stone foundation. Attached to the southeast corner is a similar extension, giving the whole house an L shape. Detached from this extension is a one-story frame gabled garage. All faces are sided in clapboard. Across the first story of the north (front) facade is a wooden veranda. Its chamfered wooden posts with scroll-sawn side brackets hold up a flat wooden roof. Stone stairs, alongside a balustraded wooden wheelchair ramp, lead up to the deck, which has a latticework wooden drape below. A similar veranda is located on the south. On both stories, windows are set with double-hung two-over-two sash, with decorative drip-mold wooden lintels and flanking louvered wooden shutters. The attic windows are smaller and round-arched, but otherwise have the same treatment. On the rear extension's west face, the windows of a small flat-roofed projecting bay are one-over-one double-hung sash, and are matched by recessed panels in the basement beneath. The south (rear) facade of the main block has the same window treatment but a simpler, square, single-light, single-hung attic window. Below the roofline is a simple wooden frieze. Above it the broad overhanging eaves end in a molded cornice. The roof itself is shingled in slate and pierced in the middle by three corbelled brick chimneys with stone caps. The garage addition has a gabled roof. Its foundation is purely brick. It has three-light casement windows in the basement and large double doors with six-light windows. =Interior= An extensively molded surround frames the segmental arched main entrance. It has panelled reveals and a transom with a single light. The double doors have decorated panels below double-light hinged windows. They open onto the original floor plan. A central hall with a stairway to the upper floors. On the east is a living room, with a dining room opposite, and the kitchen to the rear of that. Double doors at the south end lead to the rear veranda. The main feature of the living room is its original fireplace. It has a stone hearth, black brick surround (giving way to red at the chimney). Its molded wooden surround and mantelpiece have square pilaster capitals below a frieze with a floral pattern. Both the living and dining rooms share molded baseboards and ceilings connected to the wall with a slight cavetto. The dining's room fireplace has been covered. Its most notable decorative feature is the entryway to the projecting west bay, an elliptical arch with projecting brackets. Within the bay itself the walls have panels below the windows. The kitchen, to the south, has low vertical wainscoting and a recess for the old dumbwaiter in the rear wall. A door in its south wall leads to a section of the garage that has been renovated into living space. A staircase with a turned and panelled newel post, octagonal at its base, and a balustrade featuring turned and fluted balusters leads up to the second floor. From there it extends along the hall to the door to the attic stairs. There are four bedrooms. The floor has a lower baseboard than the first floor and no molded detailing, but is otherwise similar to the downstairs. The master bedroom has its own bath, the dumbwaiter's upper recess, and a closet incorporating two chests, their drawers retaining their detailed handles. In the south wall of the hallway, a door leads to stairs with a molded handrail down to the kitchen. Next to it another door opens onto the rear veranda's roof. With the exception of an east room set off by vertical boards, the attic is unfinished. Brick nogging is in between the gable studs and the rafters, where they meet the floor. Below the first floor, double bulkhead doors of paneled wood sheathed in metal under a segmental arched brick lintel lead to the basement. Inside, the basement has a concrete floor, round wooden supports and a wooden staircase to the kitchen. The garage addition's first floor has been extensively renovated for residential purposes and does not have much of its original finish. Some traces remain, such as the stuccoed walls, tin ceilings and ceiling radiators. History Originally known as Sing Sing, Ossining was for its earliest years primarily a port along the Hudson River, where farmers further inland brought their crops to ship to the markets of New York City downriver. They came down the Croton Turnpike, today Route 133, or the Albany Post Road (now U.S. Route 9). The settlement became Westchester County's first incorporated village in 1813.Village of Ossining; , April 2010; p. 34; retrieved February 10, 2013. Development began to benefit Ossining in the next several decades. First the Post Road was relocated to the west, creating the crossroads that now centers the village's downtown. Then, later in the decade, the prison was built. A decade afterwards, in 1837, the Old Croton Aqueduct, no longer in use today but a National Historic Landmark, was built through downtown, to provide water to New York. This era was capped by the construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1849. Ossining was now an hour from the city by train, making it possible to work there and live in what was still the country. Within the railroad's first year it was already offering three extra trains during morning rush hour two years later it had to add another one. The combined population of the village and the surrounding Town of Ossining nearly doubled in the railroad's first six years. The Civil War in the early 1860s slowed this growth but did not stop it. By 1880, it had grown by more than 50%, to almost three times its 1850 population.Significant Sites and Structures, 171. During this era Richard Austin, a local lawyer whose family had been living in the area since 1820, was one of many to recognize the potential for growth. Along with his family, he bought vacant local parcels and sold them to people who would build houses on them. Throughout the seven decades of peak development in Ossining, records show that Austin, his father and grandfather were involved in 58 real estate transactions. In 1878, he was living on Main Street downtown, near where he worked. He decided to build a new family home on two acres () then just outside the village limit, in an area where farmland was slowly giving way to middle-class housing. There were over 20 houses within a half-mile (1 km) of the site. Austin chose to build in the Gothic Revival style's Picturesque mode. This movement had been kicked off in the 1830s by the writings of Andrew Jackson Downing, who lived further up the Hudson in Newburgh. In his pattern books, particularly The Architecture of Country Houses, he extolled the rustic simplicity of the many cottage designs as more honest and attuned to the surrounding natural landscape in a way that the Greek Revival, the preferred mode for country homes in the early 19th century, could not possibly be. While it is a rather late application of the style, the Austin House nevertheless has the features Downing advocated. It has a single, symmetrical form with cross-gables and a full-width veranda. Ornament is not shunned but reserved for the main features of the house, such as the brackets on the veranda and the main entrance's door paneling. While it is unavoidably present, it remains simple in character, another virtue Downing sought. The Austins lived in the house for 15 years after its construction, by which time the suburbanization of Ossining was complete. After they sold the house in 1893, it passed through other private owners. One of them built the two-and-a-half-story rear addition in 1911. In 1920, a barn that had originally been on the rear of the property was removed to a short distance away and converted into a residence. By 1930, the garage addition had been built. There have been no other significant changes to the house. In 1970, it was sold to the Ossining Historical Society, which moved there from its former quarters in Washington School, another National Register-listed property a mile to the west along Croton. It uses the house as its offices and a museum, open by appointment only.

It was built by the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company and connects Bingen am Rhein on the Left Rhine line with Saarbr√ºcken. It was opened between 1858 and 1860 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. The section south of Bad Kreuznach is part of the regionally important transport corridor between the two major cities of Mainz and Saarbr√ºcken. History = First initiatives and the opening of the Neunkirchen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken section = Construction of the Nahe Valley Railway As early as 1839, there were plans to build a railway connection between the Saar and the Middle Rhine, which could not be realised due to high construction costs. The first section between Neunkirchen and Saarbr√ºcken was built as continuation of the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was completed in 1849 and had already been extended to Neunkirchen in 1850. The main railway was used to transport coal from the Saar district to the Rhine. The Palatine administration originally considered that St. Ingbert, which was in Bavaria, would be at the western end of the line, but this changed under pressure from Prussia. It wanted a connection in the long-term to Saarbr√ºcken that ran only through its own territory and considered the Ludwig Railway should connect with it. For this reason, the line was built to Bexbach, from where it was later extended via Neunkirchen and the Sulzbach valley to Saarbr√ºcken. Prussia also wanted the coal mines in the Holzhauertal and Landsweiler-Reden to be connected to the railway. The management of the projected line in Prussia was the responsibility of the Royal Saarbr√ºcken Railway (K√∂niglich-Saarbr√ºcker- Eisenbahn), which was also responsible for the Forbach Railway (Forbacher Bahn) from Bexbach via Neunkirchen and Saarbr√ºcken to Forbach in France. The line between Neunkirchen and Saarbr√ºcken was opened in 1852. = Formation of the Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìNeunkirchen section = In 1856 construction of the line was undertaken by the private Rhine-Nahe Railway Company (Rhein-Nahe Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, RNE) set up for this purpose. It would connect the Nahe Valley and the surrounding area with the Left Rhine line of the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinischen Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RHE) and the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) in Bingerbr√ºck and would stimulate economic development and open up the market for Saar coal by connecting the Saarland railways with the Middle Rhine Valley. It was proposed that the line be privately financed with a government guarantee of a return of four percent. The Prussian government took control of the project on 18 June 1856 and issued the concession for the railway‚Äôs construction and operation to the company on 4 September 1856. The Prussian government required the line to follow the course of the Nahe. In two places, however, the territory of two other countries had to be crossed: the Herrschaft of Meisenheim, which still belonged to the landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, and the Principality of Birkenfeld, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. Prussia argued about the route of the line, especially with Oldenburg. While Oldenburg would have liked to see the line pass through the city of Birkenfeld, Prussia insisted on a route through the Nahe valley. At the same time, an initiative from the neighbouring region of the Palatinate for another variant, which would have had the planned route leave the Nahe valley at Staudernheim and run to Altenglan through the Glan and then via Kusel either through St. Wendel or alternatively along the Oster valley. For tactical reasons, Prussia remained open-minded about these efforts, which led to Oldenburg giving way and accepting the route along the Nahe within its territory. After a contract was let for the construction of the line, construction of the 120 km-long single- track line began in 1857. =Construction of the line = DB local service hauled by diesel locomotive BR 212 062-4 near Staudernheim in 1986 The first 16 km section from Bingerbr√ºck (now Bingen Hauptbahnhof) to Bad Kreuznach went into operation on 15 July 1858. This was followed by the sections to Oberstein on 15 December 1859 and to Neunkirchen (Saar) via Birkenfeld (now Neubr√ºcke) and St. Wendel on 26 May 1860, with a total length of 52 or 53 km. The 21.2 km section to Saarbr√ºcken was completed on 16 November 1852. Even before the construction the line was finished, the Royal Railway Administration at Saarbr√ºcken (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn-Direction zu Saarbr√ºcken) took over its management and operation. The railway was considered a regional lifeline that would promote industrialisation in this agricultural area of the upper Blies Valley and the Nahe Valley, which was affected by high unemployment, rural exodus and emigration. The line connected to Bingerbr√ºck on the Rhine and the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) to Mainz on 17 October 1859 and down the Rhine to the Left Rhine Railway (Linke Rheinstrecke) of the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE) on 15 December 1859. This was followed by a connection with the Hessian Ludwig Railway to Mainz on 15 December 1859. At the beginning of November 1861, this was followed by the opening of the Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìR√ºdesheim train ferry, connecting to the Nassau Rhine Railway, opened in 1856 by the Wiesbaden Railway Company (Wiesbadener Eisenbahngesellschaft), which was nationalised in 1861 as the Nassau State Railway (Nassauische Staatsbahn). =Further development= The 121 km-long line of the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company was called by Arthur von Mayer the most expensive line in Germany; this was the result of its very difficult construction, which included a large number of tunnels, bridges, embankments and cuttings. The construction cost more than one million thalers per Prussian mile (7,532.5 metres), then a record sum. At first, there was a sharp competition with the Palatine Ludwig Railway, since both lines primarily served the transport of Saar coal. In addition, Prussia endeavoured to influence the traffic flows from the north-western Palatinate to the Nahe. For this reason, for example, Heimbach station was built along with a road to the Palatinate town of Kusel. The RNE expressly pointed out that this station was specifically built for this town. The station lost its importance, however, as early as 1868, when the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway, which branched off the Ludwig Railway was opened. The revenue of the company after the start of operations was well short of expectations. Since the passenger traffic met the expectations of the builders only to the spas of Kreuznach and M√ºnster, neither dividends nor interest on debt could be paid. As a result, the Prussian government was obliged to step in to meet its annual interest rate guarantee. This also meant that the government was unable to sell the line to the Rhenish Railway after the War of 1866. For strategic reasons, a line to Kreuznach was built from Gau Algesheim in 1902, which required a new station to be built. From then on the old Kreuznach station served only as a freight yard. The Birkenfeld station was five kilometres from the capital of the Principality of Birkenfeld. Therefore, the town and Degussa GmbH funded the construction of a railway from the town of Birkenfeld to Neubr√ºcke. The original Birkenfeld was renamed Neubr√ºcke station. The RNE took over the management of the Birkenfeld Railway and opened it on 5 October 1880. As the line formed part of a route to the French border, it was soon duplicated. The line was connected to the Hindenburg Bridge, which was built between R√ºdesheim am Rhein and Bingen-Kempten for strategic reasons. The bridge was built between 1913 and 1915 and destroyed in 1945. It connected a junction in M√ºnster-Sarmsheim on the Nahe Valley Railway with the Right Rhine line. Because of the great military importance of the line, the RNE was acquired by the Prussian government with effect of 1 April 1881 and the company was dissolved. It became part of the Royal Railway Administration at Cologne, left Rhine (K√∂niglichen Eisenbahndirektion K√∂ln, linksrheinisch) of the Prussian state railways from 1 July 1883. Between 1965 and 1979, the so-called Munzinger-Express also operated between Staudernheim and Bad Kreuznach. = Operator= Until the timetable change on 14 December 2014, the passenger services were operated by DB Regio S√ºdwest. Regentalbahn‚Äôs subsidiary vlexx GmbH now operates passenger services on the Nahe Valley Railway from Saarbr√ºcken towards Mainz and Frankfurt. It uses diesel multiple units of the LINT 81 and 54 classes. Passenger services on the Bad Kreuznach to Bingen section are still operated by DB Regio S√ºdwest. = Connection over the Rhine = A line ran from Laubenheim over the Hindenburg Bridge for thirty years (1915‚Äì1945), carrying traffic across the Rhine to R√ºdesheim and Geisenheim. The old railway embankments are still visible. =New tunnel construction = Coal was mined near the original Bildstock Tunnel (481 m) and a pillar of coal had to be left in place to support the foundations of the tunnel. The former Saargruben (later Saarbergwerke AG; today: DSK) mining company wanted to remove this to extend its mine. In 1955, therefore, the new Bildstock Tunnel (341 m) was built with an improved 600 m radius, bypassing the former tunnel. =Accidents = On 16 January 1918, the embankment between Kirn and Hochstetten (Nahe) was washed away during a storm by the Nahe and subsided. This caused the derailment of train 243, with troops on leave, causing the locomotive, van and three carriages to plunge into the river. 38 people were killed and 25 wounded.  Recent developments  The Nahe Valley Railway is one of the main axes of rail passenger traffic in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. During the last major rebuilding of the rail superstructure in 2004/2005, heavier rails (UIC 60 profile) were installed on concrete sleepers to allow the operation of tilting trains. The stations in Rhineland- Palatinate, formerly consistently in dilapidated condition, are gradually being rebuilt (like Neubr√ºcke (Nahe), Kirn, Monzingen, Bad Sobernheim and from 2011, after years of dispute with Deutsche Bahn, also Bad Kreuznach). The rehabilitation of the tunnels on the line has now begun with the upgrade, relining and partial renewal of the tunnels at Heimbach and related slope safety measures. In the Saarland, all stations, except Neunkirchen, have been equipped with electronic ticket machines. For a while an upgrade of the line was considered for the northern branch of the Paris‚ÄìOstfrankreich‚ÄìS√ºdwestdeutschland (Paris‚ÄìEastern France‚ÄìSouthwest Germany) high-speed line. It was later decided to upgrade the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway, because the costs for the electrification on the tunnel on the Nahe Valley Railway, which would habe been required, were too high. = Rhineland Palatinate integrated timetable for 2015 = Class LINT 81 diesel multiple unit of vlexx GmbH in Mainz With the introduction of the concept of the Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt 2015 (Rhineland Palatinate clock-face timetable) in the middle of 2008, services on the Nahe Valley Railway were improved. With the electrification of the line from T√ºrkism√ºhle to Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìT√ºrkism√ºhle Regionalbahn service was extended to Neubr√ºcke. In addition, the Regionalbahn station of Hoppst√§dten (Nahe) is now only served by a bus conveying passengers to/from Neubr√ºcke. This measure has already been implemented for the 2014/2015 timetable change. The electrification works meant that section the section between St. Wendel and Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) had to be closed from 28 July 2014 to 4. September 2014. A rail replacement bus service was operated. Heimbach, Nohen and Kronweiler are now served by a regular Regionalbahn service from Baumholder to Idar- Oberstein, extending to Kirn in the peak as part of the reactivation of passenger services on the nine kilometer-long branch line from Heimbach to Baumholder. The stations of Heimbach (Ort) and Ruschberg on the branch line are also served again. The infrastructure operator of the branch line is RP Eisenbahn. The following stations on the Nahe Valley Railway are planned or under consideration (this does not include Baumholder, Heimbach Ort and Ruschberg, which are on the branch line): * Idar-Oberstein Gewerbepark * Idar- Oberstein Globus * Bad Sobernheim Schulzentrum * Niederhausen * Bad Kreuznach Rheingrafenstra√üe * Bad Kreuznach Michelin * Planig and * Mainz Schott AG The Nahe-Express from Frankfurt am Main to Saarbr√ºcken would possibly be split or coupled every hour in Bad M√ºnster am Stein. The other portion of the train would run to/from Kaiserslautern. Route  Between Bad Kreuznach and T√ºrkism√ºhle the route runs primarily on the north side of the Nahe. The line crosses the Nahe twice in the four km section between Bad Kreuznach and Bad M√ºnster and eleven times between Bad M√ºnster and Idar-Oberstein. It runs along the Blies between St. Wendel and Neunkirchen (Saar) Hbf. The Nahe Valley Railway runs largely parallel to federal highway 41 and their paths cross several times. The first crossing takes place north of Bad Kreuznach. The railway and highway run parallel from Bad Sobernheim through the Nahe valley, until the road leaves the valley in the Idar-Oberstein district of Enzweiler. The railway and road also run parallel on a second, much shorter section between Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) and Nohfelden. South of Namborn the railway line crosses the road again and the two run parallel with the course of the Blies between St. Wendel and Ottweiler. West of Neunkirchen, highway 41 crosses the line one last time. The line crosses the A 8 and A 623 autobahns on its way to Saarbr√ºcken Hauptbahnhof. Track upgrading  The section between T√ºrkism√ºhle (line-kilometre 89.0) and Saarbr√ºcken Hauptbahnhof has been electrified since 1969 and the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìNeunkirchen line via Fischbach-Camphausen (Fischbach Valley Railway) has been operated electrically since 1965. Because work was carried out from 2007 to 2013 on sections of tunnel to enlarge the internal radius of the tunnels from four to five metres, operations between Neubr√ºcke and Idar-Oberstein ran over a single track for several months. In the summer of 2012, the section of the line between Neunkirchen and Saarbr√ºcken was closed to allow renewal of the track and repair work on the Bildstock Tunnel. Regional-Express and freight trains were diverted via the Fischbach Valley Railway and the remaining passenger services were replaced by buses for the duration of the work. The section between T√ºrkism√ºhle and Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) was electrified in the summer of 2014, requiring it to be closed for six weeks. Operations  Regionalbahn service operated with class 628 DMU in Mainz Hauptbahnhof on its way to St. Wendel The Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìT√ºrkism√ºhle section has long had a dense service. After the line was electrified, services were mainly operated with Silberling carriages hauled by class 140 and 141 electric locomotives. North of T√ºrkism√ºhle class VT 95 (795) and VT 98 (798) railbuses were often used. Express trains running between Saarbr√ºcken, Idar-Oberstein, Bad Kreuznach, Bingen, Mainz and Frankfurt am Main were also mostly formed of Silberling carriages hauled by class 01 steam locomotives and later by class V200 and 218 diesel locomotives. Already in 1960 there were long-distance trains between Paris Gare de l'Est and Frankfurt, which stopped only at Saarbr√ºcken, Neunkirchen, St Wendel, Neubr√ºcke, Heimbach, Idar-Oberstein, Kirn, Bad Sobernheim, Bad M√ºnster, Bad Kreuznach, Bingerbr√ºck and Mainz. In 1985 the line was upgraded. The D 258/59 express from Paris Est to Frankfurt operated over the Alsenz Valley Railway between Kaiserslautern and Bad Kreuznach, using French carriages and was hauled from Saarbr√ºcken to Frankfurt by class 218 diesel locomotives. This was followed in 1988 by a pair of D-trains (expresses) on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìFrankfurt‚ÄìKassel‚ÄìG√∂ttingen route, which also ran over the Nahe Valley Railway. In 1990 these long distance services were discontinued. vlexx 620-410 (LINT 81) running as RE 3 service from Frankfurt to Saarbr√ºcken in T√ºrkism√ºhle Today, there is an hourly service on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMainz route, run as the Rhine-Nahe-Express (RE3) Regional- Express service. Every second train runs to and from Frankfurt and stops at the Frankfurt Airport Regional station. Until 2014, tilting systems of class 612 were operated, but since the change of operators in December 2014, vlexx has operated LINT 54 and 81 diesel multiple units without tilt technology, although the journey times on the line have only increased slightly. Regionalbahn line RB 73 services on the T√ºrkism√ºhle‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken section are operated with class 425 and 426 electric multiple units. On the Heimbach‚ÄìMainz section, the vlexx RB 33 and RB 34 services are operated with LINT 54 and 81 diesel multiple units.  Operating points = Bingen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof = Bingen (Rhein) Hbf Binger Hauptbahnhof is located in the suburb of Bingerbr√ºck, which until 1969 was an independent municipality. For this reason it was called Bingerbr√ºck station. Because it has been incorporated into Bingen am Rhein, it was given its present name in 1993 as the most important station in the city. = M√ºnster-Sarmsheim = The halt (Haltepunkt) of M√ºnster-Sarmsheim is located on the north-eastern edge of M√ºnster-Sarmsheim. = Langenlonsheim = Langenlonsheim station is located in the north of Langenlonsheim. From 1889 to 1984, the Trans-Hunsr√ºck Railway (Hunsr√ºckquerbahn) ran from it via Simmern to Hermeskeil, but it is now only used by freight as far as Stromberg (Hunsr√ºck). = Bretzenheim (Nahe) = The halt of Bretzenheim (Nahe) is located on the southern outskirts of Bretzenheim. = Bad Kreuznach freight yard= At the time of the opening, this was the terminus of the Nahe line. With its extension to Oberstein it became a through station. With the establishment of the Gau Algesheim‚ÄìBad Kreuznach railway, it lost passenger services, but remained as a freight yard. = Bad Kreuznach = Bad Kreuznach station is located in the centre of Bad Kreuznach. = Bad M√ºnster am Stein = Bad M√ºnster am Stein station Bad M√ºnster am Stein station was originally a through station, but with the opening of the Kreuznach‚ÄìOberstein section, it became a junction station. It was connected to the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn), which was built for strategic reasons in 1904. As a result, it became the junction of three double-track lines. It was bombed in the Second World War because of its importance as a strategic railway junction. Its entrance building is a monument-protected Jugendstil building, which includes a partly half-timbered building. It was completed around 1910 during the construction of the strategic railway. Its architecture reflects the fact that Bad M√ºnster is a health resort. The Odernheim‚ÄìBad M√ºnster section of the Glan Valley Railway was closed in 1961 and only the section of track to the nearby branch to the Niederhausen power station continued to be served, but this was closed in 1992. Freight operations at the station ended at the end of the 1980s. = Norheim = The halt of Norheim is located in the centre of Norheim. = Staudernheim = Staudernheim station was opened with the Kreuznach‚ÄìOberstein section originally as a through station. In addition, it was the only station in Hesse-Homburg. After the connection of the lower Glan Valley Railway to Staudernheim station it was extended in 1897. With the opening of the strategic railway to Bad M√ºnster, the section between Odernheim and Staudernheim became essentially a connecting curve. It regained importance after the closure of the Odernheim‚ÄìBad M√ºnster section in 1961, but it was finally closed in 1996. = Bad Sobernheim = Bad Sobernheim station Bad Sobernheim station is located in the south of the town of Bad Sobernheim not far from its centre. Until 1995, it was called Sobernheim and it only received its current name when the town received its prefix of Bad (bath). = Monzingen = The halt of Monzingen is located on the southern outskirts of Monzingen. = Martinstein = The halt of Martinstein is located on the southern outskirts of Martinstein. = Hochstetten (Nahe) = The halt of Hochstetten (Nahe) is located on the southeast edge of Hochstetten. = Kirn = Kirn station is located on the southern outskirts of Kirn. = Kirnsulzbach = The halt of Kirnsulzbach is located in the south of Kirn- Sulzbach. = Fischbach-Weierbach = Fischbach-Weierbach station The halt of Fischbach-Weierbach is located in the southeast of Fischbach; Weierbach is further south-west. = Idar-Oberstein = Originally Idar-Oberstein station was called only Oberstein. It was commissioned in December 1859 as the terminus of the section opened from Kreuznach. Already half a year later it became a through station when the line was extended to Neunkirchen. It is located in the south of the town of Idar-Oberstein. = Kronweiler = The halt of Kronweiler is located in the centre of Kronweiler. = Nohen = The halt of Nohen is located in the centre of Nohen. = Heimbach (Nahe) = Heimbach (Nahe) station is located about three kilometres west of the municipality of Heimbach, which despite its name lies outside the Nahe valley. It is in the territory of Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach. The railway to Baumholder was reactivated from the timetable change on 14 December 2014. = Hoppst√§dten (Nahe) = The halt of Hoppst√§dten (Nahe) is located to the east of Hoppst√§dten. Since the timetable change on 14 December 2014, only a few Regionalbahn services stop at this station. Hoppstadt is now connected to the railway network mainly by a bus to Neubrucke. = Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) = Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) station Neubr√ºcke (Nahe) station is located in the southeast of Neubr√ºcke in the municipality of Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach. The now dismantled Birkenfeld Railway (Birkenfelder Eisenbahn) branched from the station; the line connected Birkenfeld to the rail network. With the electrification of the Nahe line to Neubr√ºcke, it has serves as the terminus of RB 73 services from Saarbr√ºcken since the timetable change on 14 December 2014. = Nohfelden = The halt of Nohfelden is located at the western edge of Nohfelden/Nahe. = T√ºrkism√ºhle = T√ºrkism√ºhle station is located on the northeastern edge of T√ºrkism√ºhle, a town in the municipality of Nohfelden. It was put in operations in 1860 with the opening of the section between Oberstein and Neunkirchen. It became the terminus of the Hochwald Railway (Hochwaldbahn) from Trier when it was opened in 1889. The T√ºrkism√ºhle‚ÄìKusel railway was opened in 1936. Both branches have now lost their passenger traffic. As a result of the electrification of the Nahe railway to Neubr√ºcke (Nahe), the station has not been the terminus of the RB 73 from Saarbr√ºcken since the timetable change on 14 December 2014. = Walhausen (Saar) = The halt of Walhausen (Saar) is located on the southern outskirts of Walhausen (Saar), a village in the municipality of Nohfelden. = Namborn = The halt of Namborn is located on the northeastern outskirts of Namborn. = Hofeld = The halt of Hofeld is located in the centre of Hofeld, a village in the municipality of Namborn. = Baltersweiler = The halt of Baltersweiler is located on the south-eastern outskirts of Baltersweiler, a village in the municipality of Namborn. = St. Wendel = Class 425/426 in St. Wendel station St. Wendel station is located in the centre of the town of St. Wendel. The now dismantled St. Wendel‚ÄìTholey railway branched from it. = Oberlinxweiler = The halt of Oberlinxweiler is located on the eastern edge of Oberlinxweiler, a village in the municipality of St. Wendel. = Niederlinxweiler = The halt of Niederlinxweiler is located close to the centre of Niederlinxweiler, a village in the municipality of St. Wendel. = Ottweiler (Saar) = Ottweiler (Saar) station was put into operation in 1860 with the opening of the section between Oberstein and Neunkirchen. It was not until 77 years later that the Oster Valley Railway (Ostertalbahn) opened to Niederkirchen, making it a junction station. It was extended a year later to Schwarzerden and is now operated as a heritage railway. The entrance building was rebuilt and an island platform was built for the opening of the branch line. In addition, it received a pedestrian underpass. = Wiebelskirchen = The halt of Wiebelskirchen is located in the west of Wiebelskirchen, a village in the municipality of Neunkirchen, right at the end of the tunnel. It used to be a block post. = Neunkirchen (Saar) Hauptbahnhof = Neunkirchen (Saar) Hauptbahnhof Neunkirchen Hauptbahnhof is located on the northern outskirts of Neunkirchen. It was opened in 1850 and is now a Keilbahnhof (wedge station). It is also the terminus of the Fischbach Valley Railway (Fischbachtalbahn)‚Äîwhich runs from here parallel with the Nahe Valley Railway to the terminus of both lines at Saarbr√ºcken, at a distance of about two kilometres‚Äîand the Homburg‚ÄìNeunkirchen railway. The platforms of the Nahe Valley Railway are numbered 1 to 3 and the platforms of the line towards Homburg/Wemmetsweiler are numbered 25 to 27. The former platforms 4 and 7 were on the Fischbach Valley Railway and the Nahe Valley Railway. Trains from/to Schiffweiler now initially run over the Nahe Valley Railway. The Neunkirchen‚ÄìNeunkirchen-Heinitz railway, formerly connected from the collieries of Dechen and Heinitz. The station is also a distribution point for freight transport and freight tracks extend along all the lines. While the station used to be mainly used for coal and steel trains, it now mainly serves for train marshalling. There are also eight connecting tracks to the rolling mill of Saarstahl AG (Saar Steel). The station has a central signal box of the class, which was built in 1965. Apart from Neunkirchen station, it controls the stations on the Sulzbach line (Dudweiler, Sulzbach, Friedrichsthal, Landsweiler-Reden) as well as Bexbach station on the line to Homburg and its long-distance signals. The station is currently barrier-free and equipped with lifts, but it is still in a poor condition. There are toilets and free parking. = Landsweiler-Reden = Landsweiler-Reden station is located on the southern outskirts of Landsweiler-Reden, a village in the municipality of Schiffweiler. In the past, the station was just called Reden. It is located opposite the now closed Reden colliery. The line ran here as three tracks to Neunkirchen to the (now partly disused) west side of Neunkirchen Hauptbahnhof (Schlawerie), with separate passenger tracks (the existing tracks) and a track from the two mines of Itzenplitz and Reden (only the railway embankment now exists). In addition, there was a line to the Itzenplitz colliery in the neighbouring town of Heiligenwald.Map of the Reichsbahndirektion Mainz of 1 January 1940 The station was in a poor condition until 2016, when it was fundamentally renovated in the spring of 2016. There is a signal box of class in the station building, which is normally remotely-controlled from Neunkirchen station. = Bildstock = The halt of Bildstock is located on the northwestern outskirts of Bildstock, directly in front of Bildstock tunnel. Previously, it had two signal boxes. = Friedrichsthal Mitte = The barrier- free halt of Friedrichsthal Mitte, which is close to the centre of Friedrichsthal, was opened in 2004. It is located on the other side of the Bildstock tunnel. = Friedrichsthal (Saar) = Friedrichsthal (Saar) station is located in the southwest of Friedrichsthal. The station building is in poor condition. = Sulzbach (Saar) Altenwald = The halt of Sulzbach (Saar) Altenwald is located at the level of the Sulzbach suburb of Altenwald. = Sulzbach (Saar) = Sulzbach (Saar) station is located in the centre of Sulzbach (Saar). It used to be a connecting track to the Grube Altenwald (colliery), in addition there were several sidings and a small freight yard. Today the extensive facilities are largely dismantled, but there are still seven tracks. In the station building is the signal box for Sulzbach and Friedrichsthal, which is remotely-controlled from Neunkirchen. = Dudweiler = Dudweiler station is located in the centre of the Saarbr√ºck district of Dudweiler. It used to be a connecting track to Grube Dudweiler (colliery). The only parts of the building that are still used are the pedestrian underpass to the platform and the signal box; it is badly run-down. The signal box is remote controlled from Neunkirchen. Because freight train branch off at the station to the Saarbr√ºcken marshalling yard, the line from Dudweiler- J√§gersfreude section has three tracks. = J√§gersfreude = The halt of J√§gersfreude is located in the centre of the Saarbr√ºcker district of J√§gersfreude. Until the end of the millennium, J√§gerfreude was also a railway junction, which was controlled from the signal box in Saarbr√ºcken Hbf. The freight trains between Dudweiler and Saarbr√ºcken could use three railway tracks, because the parallel (single-track) freight bypass line bypassed it to reach the Saarbr√ºcken marshalling yard. Today, the four sets of points and block signals, which controlled the junction have been dismantled. At the same time, the first sets of points are at the level of the platform at the Saarbr√ºcken marshalling yard. The junction was abandoned as the signal box of Saarbr√ºcken Hbf was converted and control transferred to Karlsruhe. = Saarbr√ºcken Hauptbahnhof = Saarbr√ºcker Hauptbahnhof has existed since 1852 and was initially called St. Johann-Saarbr√ºcken. It is now the most important station in Saarland. In addition, it is the terminus of several other railway lines such as the Fischbach Valley Railway, the R√©milly‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway, the Saar Railway, the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway and the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìSarreguemines railway. The trains of the Saarbahn from Sarreguemines to Lebach stop in front of the station.

It is on the Omeo Highway, north of Omeo in the Shire of East Gippsland, almost totally surrounded by the Alpine National Park. Location Anglers Rest Camping Area alongside the Cobungra River and Omeo Highway The name Anglers Rest is descriptive, indicating that the location is a good spot for anglers, being close to the confluence of several noted trout fishing rivers, the Cobungra River, the Bundara River, the Big River, and the Mitta Mitta River. The Bundara River flows into the Big River a few kilometres north of Anglers Rest, and where the Cobungra River joins the Big River just south of Anglers Rest they become the Mitta Mitta River. Besides fishing, the area is also popular for white water rafting, bushwalking, camping, horseriding, and mountain biking. The Blue Duck Inn The historic Blue Duck Inn on the Omeo Highway at Anglers Rest Perhaps the most notable feature of Anglers Rest is the historic Blue Duck Inn, standing alongside the Omeo Highway crossing of the Cobungra River. The local area is in fact commonly referred to simply as 'the blue duck', rather than Anglers Rest, in reference to the prominence of this hotel. The original 1900 timber slab building operated as a butcher shop, servicing gold miners on what was at the time a walking track from Omeo to the gold fields around Mount Wills. In 1912 a successful miner called Billy O‚ÄôConnell purchased the establishment and obtained a hotel licence on the understanding that the main road would pass the building. After the road was surveyed this did not eventuate, and the inn gained its name when O'Connell nailed a panning dish out the front and wrote 'Blue Duck' on it, blue duck being the term for a failed gold lease. In the 1920s O'Connell relocated the hotel to its current location by moving two houses through the bush from Omeo on horse drays; one of these is the current main building of the inn, while the other was placed further up the hill as his home, on the site of the existing cabin accommodation. O'Connell also built a small log building behind the pub, which was staffed for a time by the Education Department as Anglers Rest Primary School (State School Number 4286), mainly to educate O'Connell's own children. The Blue Duck Inn soon became popular with anglers, who even in those days travelled from as far away as Melbourne for the fishing, including the Chairman of Commissioners on the Victorian Railways, Sir Harold Clapp. Clapp became so enamoured with the inn he arranged for apprentices at the Newport Railway Workshops to cast the bronze blue duck that still stands at the entrance. The O'Connells moved on in 1946, and the inn went through several hands before declining trade resulted in it relinquishing its liquor licence in 1967. The Blue Duck Inn was eventually refurbished and re-licensed in 1998. Bushfires 2003 bushfires The Anglers Rest area was severely impacted by the massive 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires. While hundreds of square kilometres of the surrounding region was directly affected by the fires for close to two months, an especially intense fire devastated the area around Anglers Rest on 26 January 2003, with several homes being lost, and The Blue Duck Inn barely being saved. Bushfires again threatened Anglers Rest in early January 2020. Little damage was reported within the village, the fire having stopped in the bush behind the Blue Duck Inn.

It was the first concrete house in Westchester County, built in the 1870s in the Gothic Revival architectural style. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; almost 30 years later, it was added to the nearby Downtown Ossining Historic District as a contributing property. Built by a prominent local man with an interest in new construction techniques, it has seen several different uses over the years. It was a sanitarium in the early 20th century, then a hospital and later a restaurant. For most of that century, the Squire family ran a local business school there. Since then it has returned to residential use. Building The house in the 1880s The property is on the southwest corner of the intersection of South Highland and Maple Place, across the former from Ossining High School and the latter from the brick 1870 First Presbyterian Church designed by Isaac G. Perry. The historic district boundary currently runs in the middle of the streets between those buildings, both of which are contributing properties to the district, and the cottage. To the west are other houses; an apartment building is to the south. The lot slopes to the west, in the direction of the Hudson River. The house itself is a two- story, three-bay structure of 18-inch‚Äìthick () load-bearing precast concrete blocks faced in stucco. It is topped by a steep polychromatic hipped roof shingled in a fish-scale pattern. The northern bay of the main block rises to a peaked tower above the roof. A one-story northern wing has a mansard roof pierced by gabled dormer windows.Significant Sites and Structures, 163. Bay windows project from all facades except the north. They have narrow round- arched one-over-one double-hung sash windows with stippled corners scored to give the appearance of quoins serving as surrounds, becoming segmental arches with projecting keystones; a fleur-de-lys carved from Sing Sing marble is on the front stone. Above them a bracketed cornice with broad eaves sets off the flat roof; on the second story they are echoed by a tripartite window with a projecting continuous stippled surround and otherwise similar treatment to the first-floor windows. On the northern bay of the east (front) facade, from which the southern bay projects slightly, the main entrance is located in a recessed round-arched entryway with similar decoration as the windows; its keystone has a lion. Above it is an oculus with a shell on its projecting keystone. The north wing has a wooden balustraded porch and arches as well; behind it are round-arched two-over-two double-hung sash in quoined surrounds. The gabled dormers are steeply pitched; within them are small windows similar to those below. Pendants support the brackets at the roofline cornice above the tripartite window; all the other brackets on that cornice are identical to those on the bay windows. Above the tripartite window an engaged turret rises. The lower of its two stages has round-arched one-over-one double-hung sash. Another bracketed cornice above it supports the flared, conical roof. On the entrance tower, the roofline is continued with a section of concrete laid to appear as a slightly projecting flat course. The tower's roofline is broken by another double-hung two-over-two round-arched window flanked by mirroring brackets. Above its projecting cornice is a small jerkin-roofed one-over-one round-arched window. The top of the peak has an iron weathervane and some other decor. The main entrance has a short set of steps and round-arched walnut double doors. The inside is paneled in dark oak, intricately molded. The floor is also oak, with alternating light and dark strips. All doors on the first floor are nine feet (3 m) high and echo the round-arched configuration of the entry doors, with brass hardware. Windows on the first and second floors have recesses for interior louvered shutters. The ceilings are of molded plaster, with some detailed medallions on the first floor. Around the house are seven stone fireplaces in different styles, with gold trim. The library's has a carved marble lion's head similar to that above the main entrance. History Henry J. Baker, the builder and first occupant of Highland Cottage, bought the property in 1869. A successful New York City businessman who moved to Ossining, he had an interest in construction, having initiated the effort to build a new Methodist church in town. The local newspaper reported in March 1872 that he was going to build houses of \\"Swiss architecture\\" on his lots on Highland and Mott Street (as Maple Place was then known). Concrete had been used to build American houses before, but only rarely, due to the abundance of wood and masonry. Since it was so unusual, English workers were brought over to build the house, which early on earned the disparaging local nickname of \\"Mud House\\". The concrete used for the precast blocks was Rosendale cement, made at what is now the Register-listed Snyder Estate Natural Cement Historic District in Rosendale, further north in the Hudson Valley. It would be the first concrete house in Westchester County, predating the better-known reinforced concrete Ward Castle in what is now Rye Brook by four years. The High Victorian Gothic style used was also an unusual choice for house. Six years later, in 1878, Baker died. His estate took three years to sell. In 1881, the Dickey family gave it the name Highland Cottage when they moved in. Six years later, they moved. Their buyer, an elderly woman, lived there for a short time before selling in turn to a man named John Cockcroft. Cockcroft lived in the house, without making any significant changes to it, for 17 years before selling it to Dr. Amos Squire in 1905. It would take his name as his family put it to a number of different uses over the course of the 20th century. Five years after moving in, Squire, then the head physician at nearby Sing Sing Prison, converted the first floor into Grandview Sanitarium, a mental hospital. In the years after World War I, Squire, a member of the state Naval Militia, used it as a hospital for injured sailors. During the 1920s Squire's public service continued, as the village's health officer and a county medical examiner. In 1920 the ground floor became the Castle Inn restaurant, while the Squires retained their upstairs quarters. After the restaurant moved to other premises in 1923, the family took over the house again. When Dr. Squire assumed the medical examiner's position in 1925, his secretary needed to be able to accompany him on any emergency calls, so a basement apartment was constructed for the man and his wife to live there from 1936 to 1944. After 1944, the space was rented out for medical offices. Dr. Squire died in 1949, leaving the house to his daughter, Evelyn Squire Culp, who had herself been born in the house 44 years earlier. Culp, a practicing lawyer and graduate of Columbia Business School, started the Squire School of Business in the house in 1952. She continued to teach office and secretarial skills there for 20 years, and tutored private pupils until 1984. That year she donated the house to the Westchester Preservation League. For the next 12 years it remained her residence. After she moved out in 1996, the league sold the house to a private owner, and so it has remained since.

Located in the village of Tannirpalli in the Tiruchirapalli District of Tamil Nadu, on the bank of the River Kavery (), it was founded in 1938 by French priest Jules Monchanin, who was later to adopt the name Parma Arupi Anananda, and French Benedictine monk Henri le Saux, who was later to adopt the name Abhishiktananda. Together, the two wrote a book about their ashram, entitled An Indian Benedictine Ashram which was later re-published under the title A Benedictine Ashram. The goal of le Saux and Monchanin was to integrate Benedictine monasticism with the model of an ashram. They took sannyasa and wore kavis. Trappist monk Francis Mahieu joined them in 1953, and was later to go on to found Kurisumala Ashram with Bede Griffiths in 1958. Griffiths himself stayed at Saccidananda Ashram in 1957 and 1958, and was later to return to the monastery in 1968 as its leader. Monchanin had died in 1957, and le Saux preferred more and more to stay in his hermitage in the Himalayas rather than at Saccidananda Ashram. The name \\"Saccidananda\\" is the name for the Christian Holy Trinity (the nickname \\"Shantivanam\\" meaning \\"forest of peace\\"). Literally translated as \\"Being -- Consciousness/Knowledge -- Bliss\\" (\\"Sat -- Cit -- Ananda\\") the name was coined by Keshub Chandra Sen in 1882 as the name for the Trinity. Monchanin's adopted name (Parma Arupi Anananda) similarly meant \\"man of the supreme joy of the Spirit\\" or \\"supreme formless joy\\" and le Saux's adopted name (Abhishiktananda) meant \\"bliss of Christ\\" or \\"he whose joy is the blessing of the Lord\\". The name of the monastery was a reflection of Monchanin's attempt to blend Christian and Hindu mysticism together; but it was also a reflection of Monchanin's firm commitment to Christianity. Monchanin, who was more of an intellectual than le Saux, did not desire to identify the Advaita concept of the Absolute with the Holy Trinity, stating that \\"Christian mysticism is Trinitarian or it is nothing\\", but he did believe that with a lot of work it was possible to reconcile the two mystical traditions, and this was the principle upon which Saccidananda Ashram was founded. This integration of the Vedanta with Christianity is a point upon which the two founders of Saccidananda Ashram differed. Le Saux was more radical in his thinking than Monchanin. Whilst Monchanin held to the idea of Christianizing other religions, le Saux (who often referred to Monchanin as his \\"Christian Guru\\", although there was no clear master-disciple relationship between the twain) believed that non-Christian religions could transform Christianity itself.

E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, which awarded Semj√©n his degree in sociology, confirmed that there is a significant overlap between the works of Semj√©n and Moln√°r but that retroactive overriding of the awarding process is unlawful and so will maintain his degree.

(1722‚Äì1775) was an English dissenting tutor. Life Ashworth was born at Cloughfold, Rossendale, Lancashire, in 1722.The date rests on Palmer's statement that he was ‚Äòbut fifty-three years of age‚Äô at death, and on the monumental inscription given in Baker's ‚ÄòNorthamptonshire‚Äô (i. 332). His father, Richard Ashworth, who died in 1751, aged eighty-four, was a lay preacher among the Particular Baptists; he had three sons‚ÄîThomas, Particular Baptist minister at Heckmondwike; Caleb; and John, a General Baptist minister, colleague of Dr. James Foster, who preached his funeral sermon in 1742. Caleb was originally a carpenter; he probably was not in sympathy with his father's views, and thus did not at first turn to the ministry. He was afterwards educated for the independent ministry, under Philip Doddridge, at Northampton, where he first took up his quarters in 1739; and settled at Daventry in 1746, originally as assistant to James Floyd. Under Doddridge's will, the management of the academy was left to Ashworth, and, as the Northampton congregation did not elect him their minister, he moved it to Daventry in 1752 (see Daventry Academy). He obtained the degree of D.D. from Scotland in 1759. He died on 18 July 1775. Influence Under Ashworth, Daventry Academy became a leading seat of culture among liberal independents and presbyterians, who at that time were close, and shared views on theology and church polity. A list of his students is in Monthly Repository, 1822. The academy covered languages, biblical criticism, and ecclesiastical history quite weakly; its staple was dogmatics and philosophy, including psychology (then called pneumatology), ethics, and physics. Ashworth published for his academy a Hebrew Grammar. His most distinguished scholar was Joseph Priestley, who says that Ashworth took \\"the orthodox side of every question\\" in theology and philosophy, the sub-tutor, Samuel Clark, \\"that of heresy\\". Doddridge's plan of referring to authors on all sides of every question, and requiring his students to give an account of them, was pursued by his successors. Rev. T. Thomas, a former pupil Rev. T. Thomas, in Month. Rep., 1814, p. 79. says: \\"Under Dr. Doddridge there was a more popular exterior; under Dr. Ashworth a more disciplined interior.\\" Family He married a Miss Hemings, and together they had three sons and three daughters.

The species produces moderately sized, sturdy mushrooms of a reddish-orange colour. The cap, which can measure up to across, is covered in orange fibrils, and sometimes has small scales. The yellowish stem measures up to in length by in width, and sometimes shows remnants of the partial veil. The mushrooms have thick gills of a variable colour, ranging from yellow to rust but staining darker, and the yellow flesh has a mild taste. The mushrooms leave a rusty-brown spore print, while the spores themselves measure from in length. The species is most similar in appearance to G. arenophilus and G. fulgens, but can be differentiated from both morphologically. Despite the similarities, it is not closely related to either, suggesting convergent evolution. Instead, within the genus Gymnopilus, it is most closely related to the spectabilis‚Äìimperialis clade. However, it is not particularly similar to any of its closest relatives. The species has been found only on coastal sand dunes near Olbia, in Sardinia, where it was observed growing at the base of Juncus maritimus (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen growing from both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a saprotrophic feeder, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other substrates. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts. Taxonomy Gymnopilus maritimus was first described by mycologists Laura Guzm√°n-D√°valos (a specialist in GymnopilusContu and Vizzini 2009, p. 9.), Antonio Ortega, Marco Contu and Alfredo Vizzini in 2009 in an article in the journal Mycological Progress. The description was based on several specimens collected during field work by Contu in Sardinia between January 2006 and January 2007;Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 195. the holotype was collected on 15 January 2006.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 197. The discovery has contributed to Sardinia's reputation as an area of mycological significance. The description was later published in Italian by Contu and Vizzini in the journal Micologia e Vegetazione Mediterranea, along with the description of G. purpuresquamulosus, because the original descriptions of both of these species were in English, and difficult for non-specialists to obtain. The specific epithet maritimus refers to the typical habitat of coastal sand dunes, on sandy soil or decomposing Juncus maritimus. The holotype has been deposited in the University of Granada's herbarium. Within the genus Gymnopilus, it is located in the subgenus Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzm√°n-D√°valos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G. maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis‚Äìimperialis clade, a clade that includes G. imperialis, G. spectabilis, G. junonius (often considered synonymous with G. spectabilis), G. pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis‚Äìimperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine. Description Gymnopilus maritimus mushrooms have a cap of between in width that is convex to flattened-convex in shape. There is sometimes a broad umbo, and in older specimens, the cap is depressed in the centre. The margin of the cap is somewhat wavey. The cap surface is dry and dull, coloured red to red-orange, and yellow towards the margin. It is covered in fibrils of an orange colour, and sometimes has minute scales. The dried cap turns blackish-red when potassium hydroxide is applied.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 198. The stem is in length by in width. It is attached centrally to the cap, and is either completely cylindrical, with equal thickness throughout its length, or slightly narrower towards the base, where whitish or cream mycelia are sometimes visible. It is dry, with fibres and furrows. It is a yellowish colour, bruising reddish brown. Traces of the partial veil are sometimes visible on the stem, though it does not form a ring.Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 10. The yellow (brown at the bottom of the stem) flesh can be up to thick in the cap and does not bruise. It dries dark brown. There is no distinctive odour, and the taste is mild or slightly bitter.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 199. The thick gills can be adnate (connected to the stem by the entire depth of the gill) or sinuate (wavy, with the gills becoming shallower than deeper). They are subdistant (neither close nor distant) and swollen in the middle. In colour, they are yellow in the youngest mushrooms, turning an ochre-orange, while the oldest mushrooms they are rust. The gill edges are paler than the faces, and the gills stain orange- brown or darker. No reference is made in the original description to the edibility of the mushrooms.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009. =Microscopic characteristics= Gymnopilus maritimus leaves a rusty-brown spore print. The basidiospores can measure in length, though the typical range is . In width, they typically measure , but they can be up to 8 Œºm wide. In shape, they are ellipsoid or sometimes broadly ellipsoid. The top of the spore (the side where it was once attached to the sterigma, the connection between the basidium and the spore) is rounded and blunt. The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from from the main spore in height. There is no germ pore or plage, and there is no clear depression around the hilum (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in potassium hydroxide, and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not metachromatic. The four-spored basidia typically measure in length by in width, but can be as much as 10.5 Œºm wide. They are club-shaped, but narrower in the middle. They are hyaline (translucent) and yellow to yellowish brown. The sterigmata are between 1.6 and 7 Œºm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are typically 30 to 42 (though sometimes as much as 50) Œºm long by wide. They are shaped like a flask or wine-skin. The top of the cell suddenly widens, and the cell as a whole is thin-walled, hyaline and yellowish, and sometimes appears to contain small grains. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) can be found in tufts at the top of the stem, and measure from by . They are cylindrical, or narrowly flask-shaped, sometimes with a long neck. They are, again, yellow and hyaline.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 200. The yellowish hyphae are between 15 and 13.5 Œºm wide with a wall of variable thickness. There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and is made up of yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20 Œºm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a cutis, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm. =Similar species= Although closely related, G. junonius (pictured) is different from G. maritimus in a number of ways, including the presence of a well-developed ring. There are five species similar in appearance to G. maritimus: G. arenophilus, G. decipiens, G. flavus, G. fulgens and G. pseudofulgens. G. arenophilus and particularly G. fulgens are the most similar.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 202. Though G. maritimus and G. arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G. arenophilus differs from G. maritimus morphologically. While G. maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, G. arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G. maritimus typically displaying larger warts. Like G. maritimus, G. fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G. maritimus. However, G. fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; G. maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G. fulgens stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G. maritimus. G. fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G. maritimus than the nominate variety.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, pp. 202‚Äì3. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G. arenophilus and G. maritimus, and morphological convergence between G. fulgens and G. maritimus. Gymnopilus flavus, despite also appearing on land near the Mediterranean, can be differentiated from G. maritimus as it lives among grass, especially Dactylis glomerata, and it has distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2 Œºm.Guzm√°n-D√°valos et al. 2009, p. 203. G. pseudofulgens, also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. G. decipiens, another species that grows on sandy soil, again has spores that are markedly different. The American species G. arenicola also favours sandy soil, but has significantly smaller spores than G. maritimus. Two other species of Gymnopilus found around the Mediterranean are G. corsicus and G. spadiceus. G. corsicus has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from G. maritimus. G. spadiceus shows several similarities to G. maritimus, but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores. Gymnopils maritimus is clearly a different species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; in the case of G. junonius and G. spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G. pampeanus, they are narrower, and in the case of G. imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G. junonius and G. spectabilis also grow in Europe. Habitat and distribution Gymnopilus maritimus is known only from a single site in Pittulongu, an area of Olbia, in Sardinia, Italy, which is the type locality. There, mushrooms were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal sand dunes around from the high tide line. They were observed at the base of live Juncus maritimus (sea rush) plants, growing on sandy soil or decaying plants, where they were feeding as saprotrophs. As such, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other substrates. They were observed growing from autumn to winter,Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 12. between the end of October and January. In addition to the collections in Sardinia, Contu and Vizzini speculate that reports of G. fulgens growing in \\"sand-dune heaths\\" on Great Britain, an unusual habitat for that species, may in fact show the presence of G. maritimus on the island.

She was the only female tanker in the 1st Guards Tank Army. Samusenko was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd and 1st class and the Order of the Red Star, which she received for bravery in the Battle of Kursk. Life Born in Chita or in Zhlobin District, Samusenko began her tour of duty as a private in an infantry platoon. She participated in the Winter War (1939-1940) against Finland as a private in an infantry regiment. Later she successfully graduated from the tank academy and was assigned to the 1st Guards Tank Army. Samusenko received her Order of the Red Star when her tank crew defeated three German Tiger I tanks. Later Samusenko participated in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive. World War II veteran and writer Fabian Garin, in his book Tsvety na tankakh (The Flowers on Tanks), mentioned an episode when a certain Mindlin, who fell in love with Samusenko, asked her \\"not to smoke and drink.\\" Samusenko parried with \\"Maybe you've fallen in love?\\", kissed him on the head and stopped smoking and drinking thereafter. US Army Sergeant Joseph Beyrle, who had escaped from Stalag III-C POW camp in Alt Drewitz in early January 1945, encountered Samusenko's tank brigade in the middle of January. Beyrle, one of only a few American soldiers known to have served with both the United States Army and the Soviet Army in World War II, eventually persuaded her to allow him to fight alongside the unit on its way to Berlin, thus beginning a month-long stint in a Soviet tank battalion, where his demolitions expertise was appreciated. Beyrle, who reported that Samusenko had lost her husband and her entire family during the war, cited Samusenko as a symbol of the fortitude and courage displayed by the Soviet people during that period. Samusenko died from wounds in the then German village of Z√ºlzefitz (70 km from Szczecin) during the East Pomeranian Offensive. According to World War II veteran Pyotr Demidov, she was crushed under the tracks of a Soviet tank whose driver could not see the accompanying people in the darkness. According to another version, it was a German self-propelled artillery vehicle. She was buried in ≈Åobez (Poland) near the monument to William I. On 13 March 1945 Samusenko was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class. =Spanish Civil War= In his 1975 book the Russian author Y.A. Zhukov wrote that Samusenko was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, although Garin discounted this rumor in Tsvety na tankakh. According to Garin, it came from a soldier named Balandin, who told battalion commander Zhukov that Samusenko had fought in Spain: > My [Balandin's] submachine gunner Kolka... approached her and said: \\"[...] I > saw you already under Huesca... ¬°No pasar√°n!\\" And she replies: \\"I don't > remember you\\" [...] Zhukov then asked why she concealed her service and Balandin replied that he did not know, \\"but for some reason many don't want to reveal that they fought in Spain\\". Garin, however, further cites Samusenko's boyfriend Mindlin, who later said that \\"she has never been there\\".

It was built about 1872 in the Second Empire style. Its owner, Isaac Young, was a descendant of early settlers in the area. He chose the Second Empire style, more commonly found in cities and villages than on farms, possibly as a way of demonstrating his affluence. The present structure appears to incorporate parts of a vernacular late 18th- century farmhouse, leaving several anomalies in the current house as a result. The house's position atop a low hill would have, in its time, given it a commanding view of the region, including the Hudson River and New York City's skyline. The Isaac Young House is the only Second Empire house from that era in New Castle. There have been several renovations and alterations, including the removal of its original Italianate central tower. The current owners restored it extensively after purchasing it from the Youngs. In 2004 the house and its barn were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Early history= The earliest recorded owners of the property on which the house now stands are a Henry and Mary Slason, who sold including its current lot to a Gilbert Strang in 1795. Over the course of the early 19th century it was subdivided further and eventually became property of the Chadeayne family, owners of other large parcels in the area. Isaac Young was a native of Putnam County to the north, who had come to New Castle from his father's farm in Southeast ten years after the older man's death in 1846. He worked on the farm of the Chadeaynes' neighbors the Vails, where the father had died around the same time, leaving his widow and three of their children to tend things. In that job he became acquainted with Mary, and the two wed in 1858. At some point after the 1860 census, the couple moved out and began looking for land they could farm on their own. In 1868, the present property comprising two parcels of land, a combined , were sold to Elizabeth Young, Isaac's wife. =Young family= For the rest of the 19th century, the Youngs lived at the house and farmed. Mary died in 1902, with her son inheriting the property and her husband retaining the lifetime right of tenancy, which he exercised until his own death in 1914. Although the 1900 census describes both Isaac and John, who had married one of the Chadeayne daughters two years earlier, as \\"retired\\", later records suggest that the property was again being actively farmed. An aerial photo from the early 20th century shows the house surrounded by regularly planted trees, suggesting an apple orchard or something similar. Throughout the 1920s the Youngs sold many of their landholdings. At that time the growing use of automobiles was accelerating the suburbanization of Westchester County that the railroads had begun several decades earlier, bringing it to the previously rural and agricultural northern section where New Castle is. Farms like the one the Youngs and Chadeaynes had run were increasingly being subdivided into the large residential lots which characterize the area today. At the time of John Young's death in 1939, the property was inventoried at and the house characterized as \\"of a type that is obsolete in the real estate market in Westchester County today.\\" In the years after World War II, John's widow Lottie and her son, James, sold several more parcels off, finally reaching the current lot in 1952. In 1955, unable or unwilling to subdivide the property further, they took out a mortgage on it. James' employment epitomized the change in the upper Westchester economy over the 80 years since the house was built‚Äîthe grandson of farmers, he was commuting from their land to a regular job as a commercial artist at the Manhattan offices of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Lottie Young died the same year she and her son took out the mortgage. He inherited the property. It had fallen into disrepair, and in 1961 he sold it to the current owners, the Clarks. =Recent history= Small changes had been made to the house over the years. Plumbing was installed, the breakfast room created by walling off part of the front verandah, and the half-bath created in the kitchen wing by eliminating a stair. It is likely that the cupola had been removed as well. The reforestation that followed the decline of agriculture in the region was encroaching on the view; while it was possible to see the Hudson River in 1961 from the roof, this is no longer so. (When the leaves are down the skyscrapers of the city are still visible, and the mountains of the Hudson Highlands can easily be seen to the north.) The current owners have made some changes of their own in the last 40 years. They opened a second- floor closet to provide access to the sleeping loft, then converted it into a playroom. On the third floor they created one of the bedroom closets. Most of their efforts have been aimed at restoring the original decorative splendor of the house. On the inside, the molding on the plaster ceilings has been added and the dining room molding restored. Outside, they replaced the front verandah balusters and rear verandah columns with parts meant to be as close to the original as possible. In the early 21st century the main stair's balusters and newel posts were replaced. Buildings and grounds The house is located on a lot on the east side of Pinesbridge between Apple Farm and Hoags Cross roads, three-quarters of a mile () west of its partial interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. The neighboring properties on the same side of the street are houses of various eras on similarly large lots, many now heavily wooded and planted with mature trees. It sits atop one of the area's low hills, in elevation. The house stands in a generally cleared lot, and is approached by a roughly circular driveway which leads up from the road. In a wooded portion at the rear of the lot are remnants of old stone walls and foundations. =House= The architect and builder of the house are unknown; it is probable that they were local and, if anything, used pattern books of the era. While the Second Empire style of the house was a common one in the 1870s, it was mostly used in urban settings. The Youngs supplemented the proceeds of their farming through real estate transactions, including some in nearby Ossining, so they would have been familiar with it. In choosing the Second Empire style as their preferred mode for a country house, they may have been very overtly showing off their prosperity. The house, as originally built, has a number of features further suggesting this, such as the carefully and elaborately finished interior, particularly the first floor. Its cupola, which the roof stairs were originally meant to serve, would have allowed sweeping views over the property, much less forested at the time, to the Hudson River and Palisades beyond. It is unclear why so many bedrooms were built, as it does not appear from census records or any other source that people other than the Youngs or their only child, John, ever lived there for any length of time. It is probable that the house was built by expanding and modifying an earlier one on the same site, probably an 18th-century vernacular farmhouse of the type still common in the area at the time. Many of the \\"oddities\\" of the current structure suggest this: * The secondary staircase on the first floor is how the main staircase of an earlier house would have been built and located. * The hand-hewn beams in the basement, some with the bark still present, appear to date to the earlier period. The foundation itself is only located under two of the first floor's four rooms, suggesting an earlier structure with a smaller footprint. * The kitchen wing's different window treatment and gable suggest it was originally attached to a house similar to itself. * The many windows and doors that seem to have just enough space for themselves suggest builders working carefully to fit the new house to the original. An entry in the Biographical History of Westchester County, written around 30 years later, supports this. It refers to Young as \\"constantly having made improvements and added to the beauty and value of his country home.\\" Exterior The house is a three-story, four-bay wood frame structure on a stone and brick foundation, sided in clapboard. The house is topped with a mansard roof clad in hexagonal slate scales. There are two wraparound verandahs. On the south side a brick chimney rises the full height of the building. The structure of the house and arrangement of the various architectural features such as doors and windows is asymmetrical. On the western (front) facade, there are a door and two windows on the lower floor, with three windows above. The main entrance is to the left side, set apart from the windows by a blind bay, a treatment echoed in the second-story fenestration. The door has a segmental arch with transom. On both stories the windows are set in pedimented surrounds flanked by louvered wooden shutters. They are set with two-over-two double-hung sash windows. There is a verandah across the west front with a return on the south side of the house, both having a flat roof supported by eight square columns with chamfered corners, square capitals and rectangular bases. North of the main entrance, on the facade, is a similar pilaster. Above each column, and below the eaves, are paired wooden brackets. Along the floor is a railing supported by turned balusters. At the roofline, paired brackets similar to those of the verandah support a molded cornice above a plain frieze. On each side the mansard roof is pierced by two dormer windows, both topped with gentle arches and supported by side brackets. Alternating with the windows is a medallion design formed with the slate tiles, of one red one surrounded by yellow ones. There is metal flashing at the corners. On the east (rear) elevation, there is a one-and-a- half-story gabled kitchen wing, its roof pierced by a single brick chimney in the center. The main block here is narrower than the front, and slightly off- center. Its entrance is further to the north than the main entrance, and the clapboard is wider than that on the rest of the house. There is also a wraparound veranda on the kitchen wing, with square columns that become cylindrical and arches connecting them at the roof. Its ground story has casement windows on the north, within the veranda enclosure. There are two sash windows on the south, one of which is so close to the kitchen wing it is the only unshuttered window on the house. The second floor has three different windows‚Äîa northern window with shutters similar to the windows on the front but no pediment, the middle one a small square window with a sill too long on one side, and on the south one with a larger lower pane than upper, dropping below the gable's roofline. The south elevation has two double-decker bay windows, one smaller than the other. Both are five-sided, set with six one- over-one double-hung sash augmented by a rectangular panel beneath them. At the corners are pilasters with square capitals, like the front verandah's columns. The eaves have the same double brackets as the main and verandah rooflines. On its face are windows with the same treatment as the main facade's‚Äîtwo on the first floor and one on the second. A portion of the rear verandah subsequently enclosed to create a breakfast room has casement windows, and there is a small kitchen window next to it. The upper portion of the gabled kitchen wing has two six-pane windows. The north face is the plainest. Both stories have the same pattern of three windows, pedimented and shuttered, as the west and south. The easternmost window on both is irregularly spaced, displaced to near the eastern corner. A pair of double doors in the foundation near the east lead to the cellar. =Interior= A large flagstone serves as a walk to the three front steps flanked by newel posts and railings. The main entrance doors are recessed slightly in their molded surround. They have an arched top panel with the lower corners cut out and a square lower panel with all the corners cut. First floor In the front hall, a lamp hangs from a round decoration on the plaster ceiling with curved decorations and radiating lines. The main stairs, flush with the north wall, have octagonal newel posts with beaded panels and a flattened finial. They are succeeded by turned balusters. Paneled double doors at the east end lead into the parlor, the largest room in the house. Molded baseboard runs around the entire room. The windows are complemented by panels in the wall below and a two-inch (5 cm) wooden drapery rod with acorn finials above. In the ceiling plaster is a molded cornice and two friezes, with a sunflower surrounded by other floral motifs at the center. The decorative centerpiece of the parlor is the black stone mantelpiece. It has an arched opening with beveled edges on the rectangular top. Its projecting keystone is decorated with thin incised baroque curves. The stub of a chimney still rises from it. Double doors lead into the living room to the east. It has baseboard molding and a similarly decorated plaster ceiling, although its design is more oval. A plaster archway leads into the bay window, with a baroque keystone similar to the parlor mantelpiece and pilasters with a floral motif and Ionic-style brackets on top. French doors with 14-pane windows open into the breakfast room. The living room mantelpiece is wooden with a projecting curved medallion on top and similarly incised baroque decoration. Another set of double doors leads to the dining room, in the northeast corner of the house. It, too, has baseboard molding and a plaster ceiling cornice. A passageway to the kitchen is framed by a pointed arch made of tongue and groove paneling, flanked by pilasters similar to the verandah columns. Molded doors lead to the china closet, a larger closet under the stairs, and the cellar. The dining room mantelpiece is simpler, made of wood with a rectangular top, Tudor arched opening and square pilasters, again taking after the verandah columns. A chimney breast in the room is not connected to the mantel. The kitchen is in the rear wing. Its walls and ceilings are tongue-in-groove paneling, with the exception of the brick eastern wall. A paneled door on the east opens onto the veranda; another door on the north has been nailed shut. There is a half-bath and closet on the west side, both with paneled doors. Between the three main rooms of the first floor in the main block is a back hallway with the same baseboard molding. All of its doors just barely fit, and have no molding. A small staircase leads from it to the second floor. It has a newel post with a flattened top and handrail with turned balustrade. Second floor The second floor is all bedrooms, except for that portion in the kitchen wing. Originally it was a sleeping loft as well, but has since been converted into a children's playroom. The back hall is the primary means of access to all rooms save a guest bedroom. At the top of the back stairs are an identical newel post and balustrade around the stairwell. Most doors have paneled doors and a molded surround. The exception is the two doors on the north side, of tongue- and-groove paneling without surrounds. Through a former closet, an oval door similar to a submarine's bulkhead door leads to the playroom. It is necessary to step down, and the ceiling is only 5 feet 10 inches () The exterior clapboarding is visible on the west wall. The master bedroom, with the upper bay window, is on the south side. It has the same rectangular panels as the lower window. Its arched entrance is similar but with an acanthus leaf on the front of the bracket. Baseboard molding is around the room, complemented by a cornice in the ceiling plaster. In the northeast corner is another bedroom. Its windows begin almost at floor level. There is also baseboard molding and a ceiling cornice, but its main decorative element is the mantelpiece. It is a simple Greek Revival design, with simple pilasters on each side supporting a rectangular entablature. A closed doorway that would have led to the other bedroom is wider than all the other doorways in the house. That other bedroom is the simplest in the house. It has only the baseboard molding, and simple molding over the closed door. The guest bedroom, in the southwest corner, has rectangular panels below the windows and an acorn doorstop on one of the doors from the master bedroom. It has the baseboard but no ceiling decoration. The bathroom has the baseboard molding. The lower section of its two-over-two sash is larger than the upper. The wall separating it and a hallway closet curves, and there is a chair rail around the room. Third floor Upstairs, the decoration is simpler. The walls slant due to the mansard roof. There are three bedrooms, one closet, and a stair leading to the roof. The southeast bedroom has a closet with only the lower half of the door. The exterior of the hallway door is paneled, but the interior surface is tongue-and-groove. There is a similar door on the northeast bedroom, which has a curved wall and exposed chimney. The parlor chimney comes up through the southwest bedroom. A closet with a similarly dual-surfaced door is located near the top of the stairs. The hallway's baseboard is more ornate than that in the rooms. Between the northeast and southeast bedrooms a door opens to the stairs to the roof. Cellar The cellar takes up the space under the living and dining rooms. The floor is cement. The ceiling retains some wooden beams that are crudely hewn trees, one of which still has the bark on it, support the ceiling, while others have been replaced with steel girders. On the walls the stone and brick of the foundation is exposed. A cistern on the north has been filled in. A stone column appears to have been a support for a fireplace that no longer exists. The original flue for a coal furnace remains on the west side. The inside of the cellar door has strap hinges.

During the summers of his junior and senior high school years he obtained a job performing routine chores at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Department of Biochemistry. It was during this period at UAB that Burgess began his career in chemical research. Under the guidance of the noted carbohydrate chemist, William Ward Pigman, he was given his own research project, the ‚ÄúAnhydrous Reaction of Nitrogen Dioxide with some Selected Sugars.‚Äù In 1952 Burgess was awarded an NROTC scholarship and entered Auburn University with a dual major in chemistry and physics. During his undergraduate years at Auburn he undertook research in the laboratories of Frank Stevens (Chemistry) on the Synthesis of Indole Derivatives useful as Plant Growth Regulators and Howard Carr (Physics) on the construction of a mass spectrometer. He obtained his B.Sc. degree (cum laude) in 1956.

The mountain is located in the eastern part of the range, also referred to as the Ostkaiser or East Kaiser. To the east it is flanked by the Maukspitze (2.231 m), to the north it sends a ridge to the L√§rcheck (2,123 m). To the southwest a prominent, rocky ar√™te runs over to the Regalmspitze (2,253 m) and on to the Kleines T√∂rl. To the south the Ackerlspitze drops steeply, with vertical rock faces in places, into the Leukental valley. To the northwest it falls away just as steeply into the Griesner Cirque (Griesner Kar) and to the northeast into the Mauk Cirque (Maukkar). On fine days there is an attractive and extensive panoramic view from the summit of the Ackerlspitze over the neighbouring mountain groups and as far as the Chiemsee lake in Bavaria as well as the Gro√üvenediger.  First climbed  The first touristic ascent was achieved on 1 October 1826 by Karl Thurwieser and J. Carl, led by Stephan Unterrainer.  Bases and tours  * From the south The base for the classic ascent of the Ackerlspitze is the Ackerl Hut (self-catering) at 1,460 metres. From here a narrow and very exposed path strikes north to the Niedersessel Cirque (Niedersesselkar) (there is often a steep and dangerous old icefield here until mid-July). From there the route leads up a 25-metre-rockface, partly equipped with iron rungs, through the Hochsessel and continues along the east-facing scarp to reach the summit in 3 hours total. According to the literature it is an easy grade I, but exposed tour with a risk of falling rocks, requiring dry conditions, sure footing, no fear of heights and Alpine experience. The valley base for this route is Going. * From the north A less frequented route, which is well worthwhile and less demanding than that from the south. The start point is the Griesner Alm in the Kaiserbach valley, from there the path snakes upwards to reach the Fritz Pflaum Hut (1,865 m, self- catering). From there it is another 2 hours to the top along the shaded northern flank of the Ackerlspitze. This route is rather easier, not so exposed and endangered by falling rocks compared with the southern option, but not usually usable until July due to fields of old snow. * Maukspitze crossing Those who have summited Ackerlspitze mostly traverse to the neighbouring Maukspitze which represents an easier descent than the 20-metre-wall and gully from Niedersessel Cirque. From the Hochsattel Ridge there is a signposted, but rather exposed route with no safety facilities and significant gradient. Getting down from the Maukspitze, it is most practical to take the relatively straightforward southwest-facing ramp to the Niedersessel and back to the Ackerl Hut.

On the site are: *70 houses of the 19th century (including a cabane √† sucre, a school, the doctor's house, etc.) *22 homes have guides which are dressed as the people were in those days and which reproduce the activities of artisans *18 economuseums on traditional trades *a 2.8-kilometer site situated within a natural landscape *more than 100 employees on the site References External links * http://www.villagequebecois.com/ History museums in Quebec Open-air museums in Canada Drummondville Museums in Centre-du-Qu√©bec Historic house museums in Quebec ","title":"Village Qu√©b√©cois d'Antan"},{"id":"30222538","title":"Mnet (TV channel)"},{"id":"30222548","text":"Mnet, or M-net may refer to: Entertainment * , a German internet service provider. * M-Net, a South-African-based African subscription-funded television channel and company ** M-Net Series, a defunct TV channel broadcast on the South African satellite television service DStv ** M-Net Movies, a group of film television channels broadcast in Sub-Saharan Africa. ** M-Net City, a television channel on the South African satellite television services DStv and GOtv * Mnet, a name used by the CJ Group for the following brands owned by it: ** Mnet (TV channel), a South Korean music television channel ** Mnet Media, a South Korean entertainment company under the CJ group Other uses * Mnet (peer-to-peer network) * MNET (interbank network), a Pakistani operator of inter-bank connectivity platform * m.Net Corporation, an Australian telecommunications company * MNet, the former credit card division of MCorp, now part of Bank One ","title":"Mnet"},{"id":"30222553","text":"The Saynor & Bell Canadian Cub was a single engine, single seat parasol wing monoplane, designed and built in Canada in 1930. It was intended to be a simple and economical vehicle with which pilots could increase their flying experience. It was destroyed on take-off after a few months of flight and no more were built. Development Aircraft engineers George Saynor and Robert Bell came to Canada from England in 1928 to work with Canadian Vickers, only to be made redundant two years later. They then collaborated in the design of the Canadian Cub, intending to produce a simple and economical single seater in which newly soloed pilots could build up their flying hours. They worked in the basement of a Montreal house aided by other Canadian Vickers employees but bearing the financial risk themselves. The Canadian Cub was a parasol wing monoplane with a wooden framed, fabric covered, constant chord wing which was swept at 10¬∞ to move the centre of gravity aft and keep the nose short. The fuselage was a rounded plywood monocoque, with a built-in central pylon carrying an integral 2 ft (610 mm) span wing centre section. The outer wings attached to this centre section, braced with lift struts of the less-common X form from the lower fuselage longerons. The wing pylon raised the wing to bring it level with the pilot's eyes. Visibility from the single seat open cockpit was further aided by a small trailing edge cut-out. The tail surfaces had steel tube frames, canvas covered. The fin carried a generous, rounded rudder, with its lower edge above the extreme fuselage. The horizontal stabilizer was mounted at mid-fuselage with the elevators separated. The Canadian Cub had a conventional undercarriage with split axle main gear. The wheels were mounted on V-struts to the lower fuselage, with axles running inwards and upwards to the central fuselage bottom. The Canadian Cub was stressed to allow engine powers up to 60 hp (45 kW) but the designers' financial position only enabled them to fit the small 34 hp (25 kW) ABC Scorpion II. In the end this was the only engine installed. The Cub first flew on 4 December 1930 from St Hubert Airport, piloted by E.J. Cooper. Operational history After the first flight the Canadian Cub was flown by several other pilots, who all agreed it was a delight to fly but that it was underpowered by the Scorpion engine. It had some aerobatic capability and could fly inverted. Ground handling tests in April 1930 revealed a structural weakness when the undercarriage collapsed. Repaired, the Cub lost a wing in a collision whilst parked at St Hubert when another aircraft taxied into it. Fitted with a new wing the aircraft was flown to de Lesseps Field, Toronto, probably to be demonstrated. On 11 October the engine failed at take-off; the pilot was unhurt but the sole Canadian Cub, registration CF-APS, was destroyed.

The term Candidatus indicates that it has not proved possible to maintain this bacterium in culture. Detection of the liberibacters is based on PCR amplification of their 16S rRNA gene with specific primers. Members of the genus are plant pathogens mostly transmitted by psyllids. The genus was originally spelled Liberobacter.Taxonomy browser Most importantly, Candidatus Liberibacter is a causative agent of Huanglongbing disease (HLB) also known as citrus greening disease. Candidatus Liberibacter is transmitted by two insects from Psyllidae family ‚Äì Diaphorina citri in Asia, Brazil and Florida, and Trioza erytreae in Africa. The Asian HLB strain, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus is more heat tolerant, while the African strain, Candidatus Liberibacter africanus is asymptomatic at temperatures above 30¬∞C. Species of Candidatus Liberibacter, infecting solanaceous plants has been identified and it was carried by another psyllid, a potato pest Bactericera cockerelli.  Pathogenicty  Candidatus Liberibacter are carried in the hemolymph and salivary glands of psyllids. Since psyllids feed on sap, this provides bacteria the entry to phloem of the plant. They induce significant metabolic and regulatory changes that damage the plants transport system and affects plants defense systems. These impairments have downstream negative effects on citrus microbiome of the infected plants. Since Candidatus Liberibacter cannot be cultivated outside of its vector or host, genetics, bacteria-vector and bacteria-plant interaction have not yet been thoroughly explored. Factors important for adaption and colonization or possible coevolution are not yet understood. Liberibacter activates salicylic acid pathway in host, likely due to recognition of extracellular molecules such as lipopolyscacharides or flagella. Pathogen in turn likely mitigates the effects, because it encodes SA hydroxylase, that degrades salicylic acid. Liberibacters were shown to affect the spread of vector, by influencing the flight frequencies and sexual attraction of D. citri. On the other hand, infection with Liberibacter causes higher mortality of D. citri adults, but not nymphs. Liberibacter is a part of the psyllid microbiota and co-existence with other bacteria likely has impact on the overall fitness of the insect, as well as outcome of the disease.  Treatment  Primary strategy for HLB disease management is a vector control. Antimicrobial treatment can suppress Candidatus Liberibacter spp., however usage of broad spectrum antibiotics is inadvisable due to adverse environmental effects. Alternative treatments, such as heat therapy, i.e. incubation of plant at temperatures above 40¬∞C for several days, show varying effects.

It acts as a potent agonist for the 5HT2A receptor, and has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET). History 25C-NBOMe is derived from the psychedelic phenethylamine 2C-C by substitution on the amine with a 2-methoxybenzyl group. 25C-NBOMe is a clumpy white powder with a notably bitter and metallic taste. 25C-NBOMe has been found on blotter mimics sold as LSD. Dosage Blotter paper containing 25C-NBOMe Anecdotal reports from human users suggest 25C-NBOMe to be an active hallucinogen at a dose of as little as 200-500 ¬µg insufflated and 300-600 ¬µg buccally (with threshold doses even lower), making it only half to a third the potency of LSD.2C-C-NBOMe Dose - erowid NBOMe-substituted compounds have a diminished absorption rate passing through mucus membranes, but generally remain inactive when taken orally. Buccal, sublingual or insufflated routes of administration are all viable options. Absorption rate buccally and sublingually can be increased when complexed with HPBCD complexing sugar, however the most efficient is nasal administration, which shortens the duration while increasing intensity, but has been attributed to several overdoses due to improper dosing.  Effects  = Desired = * strong open- and closed-eye visuals, including trails, color shifts, brightening, etc. * mood lift * euphoria * mental and physical stimulation * increase in associative & creative thinking * increased awareness & appreciation of music * life-changing spiritual experiences * feelings of love and empathy * increased pattern recognition (psychology) * synesthesia and chromesthesia (intensified for those who experience these while sober) = Neutral = * general change in consciousness * pupil dilation * unusual body sensations (paresthesia, flushing, chills, goose bumps) * change in perception of time, time dilation * increased heart rate * jaw clenching (bruxism) * yawning, especially when coming up * insomnia * looping, recursive, out-of-control thinking * dissociation = Undesired = (Includes negative side effects arising from overdose; likelihood of negative side effects increases with dose) * confusion and difficulty focusing * scrambled communication * tunnel vision * vasoconstriction * nausea and vomiting (normally only during the onset for those affected) * paranoia, fear, and panic * irritation of the throat * irritation of mucous membranes * upper respiratory irritation and difficulty breathing/swallowing * unwanted and overwhelming feelings or life- changing spiritual experiences * syncope * shaking * dystonia, clonus and seizure * death  Toxicity and harm potential  25C-NBOMe overdoses have been linked to multi-organ failure. It is a substituted para-Chloroamphetamine which is a known neurotoxin, 25C-NBOMe being much more potent and a direct serotonergic neurotoxic agent. Drug prohibition laws =Canada= As of October 31, 2016; 25C-NBOMe is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php = Israel = The NBOMe series of psychoactives became controlled in Israel in May, 2013. = New Zealand = 25C-NBOMe was sold as a designer drug in New Zealand in early 2012, but was withdrawn from sale after a statement by Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne that 25C-NBOMe would be considered to be substantially similar in chemical structure to the illegal hallucinogen DOB, and was therefore a Class C controlled drug analogue.‚ÄòLegal high‚Äô DIME not so legal.

Effective 14 December 2019, she concurrently serves as the State Minister for the Environment, in the Ugandan Cabinet. She replaced Dr. Mary Goretti Kitutu, who was appointed Minister of Energy and Minerals, in the same cabinet. Background and education She was born in Kitgum District, in the Acholi sub-region, in the Northern Region of Uganda, on 9 January 1964. In 1991, she graduated with an Advanced Diploma in Marketing, from Makerere University Business School.

She was elected, defeating the National Resistance Movement candidate Santa Okot. She was appointed as the shadow minister for environment, during her first term in parliament, due to her environmental activism. She became well known for her work to save the Mabira Forest in Uganda. The president Yoweri Museveni, and the government, had prior to her work decided to sell the forest to the sugar company Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited (SCOUL) to cut it down and convert it into a sugar cane plantation for ethanol production. Atim fought along with for example the National Association of Professional Environmentalists to stop the felling, and organized a boycott of SCOUL's sugar. In 2007, about 100,000 Ugandans demonstrated in a demonstration called the \\"Save Mabira Crusade\\" against the president and military to save the forest. Three people died and many were hurt. Atim Anywar's house was besieged by military and police, and she was imprisoned for terrorism. ; As an independent politician During the 2016 parliamentary election cycle, Betty Anywar lost the Forum for Democratic Change primaries.

It is the 22nd film of the Maneater Series. It was premiered January 15, 2011 on Syfy. Plot  Two military agents are taking readings on Mount Lincoln near the town of Ascension. There is a quake and the woman, Agent O'Neil, dies with marks on her face. The man, Agent McKewan, also dies after being crushed. Elsewhere, a man is injured in a work crew and dies for no apparent reason. It later appears the quakes on the mountain are producing a layer of carbon dioxide gas, suffocating those who descend to its altitude. A woman named Emily, studying Mt. Lincoln, visits the mountain to repair two machines. In the adjacent town, an old man named William is considered an eccentric for believing that the mountain contains Behemoth. Emily meets with William's son and her old friend, Thomas. Satellite images show movement under the mountain, which they attribute to volcanism. Thomas's sister Grace and her boyfriend ascend the mountain, and Thomas is persuaded to go as guide to government agent Jack Murray. They meet Emily, who is running because part of a mountain suddenly exploded; whereas Grace and her boyfriend are startled by a monstrous eye and accompanying tentacle. After she and Thomas have discovered Agent O'Neil's body, Emily has persuaded the Sheriff to evacuate the town, but Thomas and Emily ascend the mountain to look for the missing couple. They find Jack injured on the mountain, and Behemoth kills Jack immediately after revelation that the troubles at Mt. Lincoln were felt all over the world six months ago, and a missing box may be their only chance against Behemoth (lost when the agents were killed). William goes to the local diner to get the waitress, Zoe, to safety. However, an earthquake damages the town, and the diner sinks into the ground with William and Zoe still inside. The box is recovered; but the monster consumes the boyfriend, while Thomas pulls Grace to safety. Behemoth then emerges from the mountain, whereupon Thomas opens the box and fires a shoulder-launched missile into Behemoth's throat, destroying it. William and Zoe escape from the diner in a sinkhole, and all five survivors are reunited. Cast Reception Digital Retribution panned the film, criticizing the film's uninteresting characters, dialogue, and lack of screen time of the title monster. Home media Behemoth was released on DVD on April 5, 2011 by RHI Entertainment. It was re- released as a part of a 3-disk set which included the complete Maneater series.

The earliest part was built about 1720. It is a -story, five-by-two-bay, frame residence faced in shingles and clapboards. It has a center stone chimney. The rear kitchen wing and 1-story north wing were added about 1800 and the house given its saltbox configuration. In the mid-19th century, the present porch was added with its Doric order piers and a 1-story, gable-roofed wing added. Also on the property are a carriage house, former slave quarters, and a storage building / corn crib. The property was purchased by the village in 1925 from the Bush estate. See also: It served as headquarters for General Israel Putnam, 1777‚Äì1778. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History of the Homestead : The home may have been built by John Lyon II, born 1693, who had considerable farm land that included the area now called Lyon Park. There is considerable evidence that the house existed before the marriage of his daughter Ruth Lyon to Abraham Bush, who made the house their homestead. It may have been occupied by one or more of John Lyon II's sons. John Lyon II's children were: John Lyon (1713-1790); Roger Lyon (1715-1797); Elizabeth (Lyon) Treadwell (1718-1772); James Lyon (1720-1804); Ruth Lyon (1724-1802). Ruth Lyon and Abraham Bush were married c.1744. They had seven children, all born at the house between 1747 and 1766. Their son Gilbert Bush (1753-1831) married Sabrina Seymour and had one daughter Mary Emeline Bush (born about 1799, died 1893), who inherited the house. Emeline married Gershom Bulkley of Port Chester, from a family of sea merchants in the area. They had seven children born in the house, all of whom pre-deceased Mary Emeline. Upon her death, questions arose as to the ownership and preservation of the home, and after a series of court hearings involving distance relatives, the house and property were purchased by the Village of Port Chester in 1925 and preserved as a park. The Port Chester Historical Society maintains its headquarters at the homestead and welcomes any visitors to tour the homestead when the homestead is open to the public.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the centre of the town, near the town hall. History The nave and the tower of the church date from the 12th century. The aisles, the transepts, and the chancel were added in the 14th century. The tower was damaged in 1648 during the Civil War, and has never been repaired. Following this damage, the church fell into disrepair, and in 1748 the historian Philip Morant wrote that it was in a ruinous condition and that no services were being held in it. A considerable restoration took place during the late 19th century, during which the architect Giles Gilbert Scott revealed the wagon roof in the chancel. An ambitious plan of restoration was later prepared by Rev Ernest Geldart, but it was never realised. The church then became neglected again, and in 1953 it was declared redundant. The church was used by a theatre group between 1957 and 1987, but by the latter date it had become structurally unsafe. It then continued to deteriorate until it was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1996. By this time some emergency repairs had been carried out, which were financed by English Heritage. The Trust then continued to repair the building, planning this in two phases. In the first phase, the church was made dry and stable. The second phase involved cleaning the interior of the church, including the wall paintings, limewashing the remainder of the walls that had been painted black by the theatre company, refurbishing the vestry, and providing wheelchair access. This work was supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and was completed in 2003. The work was granted a Colchester Civic Trust award later in that year. The church remains consecrated. Architecture St Martin's is constructed in flint rubble and it has tiled roofs. The truncated tower and the nave are Norman in style. Many Roman stones have been incorporated into the walls of the tower and the nave. Internally, at the apex of the arch of the chancel roof is the carving of a green man. Two glazed plaques of encaustic tiles, surviving from Geldart's aborted restoration, are in the aisles. The interior of the church is unfurnished, and it is now used as an art centre.

Its song title was written by Lawrence Edward Watkin, Paul J. Smith and his main collaborator, Hazel \\"Gil\\" George. It expands the role of Del Hardy, portrayed by the popular Fess Parker, who remains with the Butler family much longer than in the novel. True Son‚Äôs blood brother, Gordon (Gordie) does not appear in the film. The character of Shenandoe, Uncle Wilse‚Äôs indentured servant, was added as a love interest for True Son. In the film the antagonism between True Son and Wilse culminates in a fist fight (with True Son the victor) rather than Wilse's scalping. While the novel ends on a note of uncertainty, with True Son alone on a remote road and unsure where his future lies, the film has him return to his family, to Shenandoe, and, presumably, to a life on a plot of wild land his father has had deeded to him. The film was shot in Lookout Valley, Chattanooga, Tennessee and California. Premiere The film premiered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on 9 July 1958 at Senate Theater with actor Wendell Corey and his wife and some Mouseketeers like Jimmie Dodd, Annette Funicello, Tommy Cole, and Doreen Tracey. Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that the film was \\"talky (much of which is quite hard to understand) and the dramatic incidents are less vivid than they ordinarily are in Disney films.

It should entertain the kids.\\"Crowther, Bosley (July 11, 1958). \\"Screen: Homespun Tale\\". The New York Times. p. 15. Variety reported that the film had \\"the same wholesome adventure qualities that distinguished 'Old Yeller.'

It houses various artworks by artists of the early 18th century from Veneto. The sacristy preserves its original furniture of the same period. History Interior view: the nave The present building stands on the site of an earlier church and convent built by the Jesuati (not to be confused with Jesuits) between 1481 and 1491 and dedicated to St Jerome. The few remains of the ancient church are the bell tower and some gravestones. Following the suppression of the Congregation of the Jesuati in 1668, the church and the convent were purchased by the Discalced Carmelites, who later expanded the religious complex, by rebuilding the church between 1720 and 1727 in a late baroque style. In the following years, the altars and interior decoration were completed, at great expense. The floor in white-and-red marble slabs was made in 1745. The architect of the project remains unknown, suggesting more than one hand. The style of the interior recalls the work of the Venetian architect Giorgio Massari (1687-1766). The local architects Giuseppe Marchi (1669-1757) and Francesco Muttoni (1667-1747) are mentioned as contributors along with Massari. The facade was built in 1756 and designed by the architect Carlo Corbellini from Brescia.Guida di Vicenza: con una carta topografica della citt√† e principali vedute, by Antonio Ciscato (1870), page 68. An alternative design for the facade was proposed by Ottone Calderari in the same year; this palladian design was used in 1824 by the architect Antonio Piovene for the facade of Church of San Filippo Neri in Corso Palladio, Vicenza.Foto d'epoca della facciata della chiesa dei Filippini The main altar for San Marco was completed in the following year. Though in use since 1725 before its completion, San Marco was consecrated in 1760 by Antonio Maria Priuli, Cardinal and Bishop of Vicenza, and dedicated to two saints: it retained the ancient title of St. Jerome and added that of Saint Teresa of √Åvila, foundress of the Order of the Discalced Carmelites.Consecration dates are noted in a plaque located between the 1st and 2nd chapels on right. It was commonly called \\"Chiesa degli Scalzi\\" (\\"Church of the Discalced\\"). In 1810 the Napoleonic laws suppressed all the religious orders and monasteries, confiscating their properties. The church of San Girolamo degli Scalzi was refitted for a short time as a tobacco manufactory, then assigned to the St. Mark parish, becoming the church of \\"San Marco in San Girolamo\\". The ancient Church of St. Mark in Vicenza, which stood nearly above the Pusterla bridge, was sold and demolished soon after. The church built by the Carmelites is remained essentially intact, even after several restorations (that of 1894 is remembered in a plaque above the entrance). The convent was entrusted to the Loreto Sisters (Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, here commonly called \\"Dame Inglesi\\") until now. Description =Exterior= Facade of the Church of San Marco in San Girolamo, front view. The baroque facade, designed in 1756 by architect Carlo Corbellini, consists of two sets of Corinthian half-columns upon tall pedestals. It hosts 11 statues of saints by sculptors Francesco Uliaco, Francesco Leoni, and Francesco Bartolomei, including side wings with statues at the corners. The triangular tympanum, with thin frames, holds three other statues in the crown. In the lower floor, in the spaces between the half-columns, there are four niches, two on the first floor, with a large niche in the center. The high central window, giving light inside, is walled at the top and was painted in trompe l'oeil. The bell tower, that can be seen on the back of the church, is the original tower built in the 15th century for the church and convent of the Jesuati. It was raised in 1933 from a design by engineer Giuseppe Dal Conte, keeping five bells cast by Colbachini of Padua. The current set has 14 bells, plus an old little bell, which are still played by hand. The San Marco bell school is the very last in the city playing by hand (or \\"by rope\\").

The nave is 28 meters (85 feet) long and 11.5 m (35 ft) wide (21 m or 64 ft, including the chapels). The chancel is 18 m (55 ft) long including the semicircular apse. The nave ceiling consists of two bays. The rhythm is punctuated by a single order of Corinthian pilasters upon high pedestals of stone. On the sides of the apse there are four chapels, and at the side of the chancel there are two more chapels - now with no altar - forming the transept. Inside the blind spaces between the chapels, now used for confessionals, there were some small oratories. The 24 gravestones on the floor date back between 1720 and 1800.  First chapel on the right (1)  It is dedicated to Saint John of the Cross, co-founder of the Order of Discalced Carmelites. The altar is made in white Carrara marble. Rising above, Corinthian columns in African gray-violet breach support an arched, broken pediment, topped by a high attic with triangular pediment in the center of which shines a golden cross flanked by two flaming pots. It is an important work of the early 18th century Venetian style. The altarpiece (1735-50) is a masterwork of the Vicenzan painter Costantino Pasqualotto (il \\"Costantini\\") and depicts The vision of St. John of the Cross. The saint is depicted kneeling before a crucifix, while Christ, carrying the cross on his shoulders, appears in the clouds with a procession of angels. To the right of the chapel is opened the baptistery, built in 1909 within an existing room, with the stone baptismal font and a bas-relief of Saint John the Baptist.  Second chapel on the right (2)  Sebastiano Ricci, The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa (1724) It is dedicated to Saint Teresa of √Åvila, the Spanish mystic that inspirated and founded the Discalced Carmelites. This altar is also made of white Carrara marble with four Corinthian columns supporting an arched pediment, on which are perched two angels. Bases and capitals are made of bronze, gilt bronze friezes are in the frontal and on the pedestals. The altarpiece (1724) depicts The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, a masterpiece by Sebastiano Ricci, that communicates an intense emotion and the sense of a mystical sight. The saint, portrayed in a temple with Ionic columns, hass fainted and supported by an angel dressed in red, while another in front of her is wielding the burning arrow of the Divine Love. Two angels hold the arms of the saint, while another, smiling, points out to the faithful.  On both sides of the arch between the nave and the presbytery (3)  Two paintings, in opulent frames of the early 18th century, depict two figures of Biblical prophets anachronistically dressed in Carmelite robes: the prophet Elisha (on the right pillar) and the prophet Elijah (left), with an angel indicating water and bread. Both were painted by the late 17th-century Veronese painter Matteo Brida.  Presbytery (chancel) (4)  The main altar (1757) is dedicated to Saint Jerome. It is made of Carrara marble with gilded bronze friezes. At the center of the frontal plaque there is the saint beating his chest. On either side, two plates represent Saint Teresa (at left) and Saint John of the Cross (at right). The door of the tabernacle is in embossed silver, gilded and engraved. On the sides, the two pairs of marble angels above the doors of the choir are by Giacomo Cassetti (1703-1760). Lacquered and gilt wooden sculptures of great value, belonging to the ancient furniture of the church (18th century), were adjusted to make the two ambos, the altar facing the people and the celebrant chair.  Chorus (5)  Behind the altar stands the ancient chorus with the wooden stalls of the monks (restored in 2010). An inscription on the floor with the arms of the Carmelite testifies the presence of a crypt below (no longer accessible) where the mortal remains of the Fathers lie. The impressive organ above the choir was built in 1900 by the firm Pugina and inserted into a solemn wooden structure designed by architect Vittorio Barichella. On the coping of the organ there is a statue of Christ the Redeemer, by the sculptor Belcaro, flanked by Saint Mark (left) and Saint Jerome (right). The organ was restored in 2009, and is appreciated for concerts.  Sacristy (6)  The complete, original set of altar and wardrobes is of considerable value. It was made in walnut inlay and carving work in the early 18th century and it was completely restored in 1988‚Äì89. It hosts 157 doors and 93 drawers. In the back wall is the altar with two columns and broken pediment flanked by two cabinets with curved pediment. Between the two columns is displayed a painting by Bartolomeo Letterini (1669-1745) depicting the Virgin Mary, Baby Jesus, St. Teresa, St. Joseph, St. Joachim and St. Anne. In front of the blade is placed a crucifix in boxwood. The side walls host two large cabinets, each comprising three major bodies joined together by two lower bodies divided by pilasters. The central parts are decorated with two paintings of the same Letterini: the one on the right depicts Saint John of the Cross, the left Saint Joseph with the Child Jesus.  Chapel to the right of the chancel (7)  On the bottom wall is a masterpiece painted by Giovanni Antonio De Pieri called \\"Lo Zoppo\\" (the cripple) from Vicenza depicting Saint Jerome in Glory (1727), while he contemplates the crucifix and is taken up into heaven by angels. It was originally located in a central position in the apse.  Chapel to the left of the chancel (8)  On the back wall are exhibited two works of the 17th century by the family Maganza, formerly belonging to the ancient church of St. Jerome of the Jesuati. The left one is the work of Giovanni Battista Maganza the Younger and it portrays The deposed Christ with Mary and Mary Magdalene, St. John the Evangelist and St. Nicholas the Bishop (1615). The right one is by Alessandro Maganza and depicts the Holy Trinity with Blessed John Colombini and St. Charles Borromeo (1612).  Winter chapel (9)  Winter chapel: detail of the original floor and the little columns of the cloister. Recently restored and dedicated to the Merciful Jesus and Saint Jerome, the chapel retains a rare painting by Giovanni Battista Maganza the Elder (1513-1586) called the \\"Magagn√≤\\", depicting Saint Jerome penitent (before 1570), the first known dated work of the artist. The back wall of the chapel has three shallow niches, found during the restoration, that host three present icons depicting Christ, Saint Mark and Saint Mary. On the bottom you can see some traces of the ancient convent of the Jesuati: the columns of the cloister, then incorporated into the wall with the expansion of the church by the Carmelites, and a large section of the original floor.  Belfry (10)  Located behind the apse, perfectly aligned with the plan of the church, the belfry was accessible through the door in the middle of the chorus that put in direct communication the church and the convent. Inside the belfry there is a fresco with the monogram of Christ \\"JHS\\", dating back to the old convent of the Jesuati; other frescoes may be seen climbing the stairs that lead to the bells, a few feet of the base, to the door leading to organ and accessing small rooms that were used by the monks.  Second chapel on the left (11)  The altar is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Four columns in elegant French red marble support a pediment surmounted by a pediment lively. At the center of the gable is placed a garland of golden metal with two palms. Frontal, and balustrade pedestals are inlaid with red marble. The altarpiece by Antonio Balestra depicts Vision of the Virgin handing the scapular to the Blessed Simon Stock in the presence of Saint Joseph (circa 1730). Simon Stock, first general prior of the Carmelites, is the patron saint of the Order. At the bottom center is depicted Saint Joseph, which an angel holding a lily. On the sides are hung two paintings by the late 18th century and early 19th century: the one on the right depicts Saint Patrick, the one on the left Saint John the Confessor; they both come from the destroyed church of St. Bartholomew (San Bortolo), like the other five paintings in octagon frames exposed in the other chapels.  First chapel on the left (12)  The altar of the chapel of Saint Anne is made in Carrara marble and behind rise Corinthian columns of gray-violet African breach, holding a curved pediment surmounted by two statues with a coat of arms in the center. The altarpiece depicts The Education of the Virgin Mary with Anne, Joachim and the child Mary, with Saint Joachim in the act of instructing the girl Mary about the prophecy of Isaiah: \\"Ecce virgo concipiet\\" (\\"a virgin shall conceive\\"). According to some scholars, the work is attributed to either Lodovico Buffetti (1722-1782) pr Gaetano Scabri (1741-1820). Artworks Giovanni Battista Maganza the Elder (called Magagn√≤), St. Jerome penitent (1570), detail. Some of the main artworks preserved in the church: *Costantino Pasqualotto: The Vision of St. John of the Cross, between 1735 and 1750, altarpiece of the first chapel on the right. *Sebastiano Ricci: Ecstasy of St. Teresa of Avila, ca. 1725, altarpiece of the second chapel on the right. *Lodovico Buffetti (attributed): Education of the Blessed Virgin, with Anna and Joachim, altarpiece of the first chapel on the left. *Antonio Balestra: Vision of the Blessed Virgin giving the scapular to the Blessed Simon Stock at the presence of Saint Joseph, between 1725 and early thirties, altarpiece of the second chapel on the left. *Giovanni Antonio De Pieri: St. Jerome hold to Heaven by Angels, 1727, right side of transept (once placed in the apse). *Matteo Brida: The Prophet Elijah and The prophet Elisha, first half of the 18th century, concave wall at both sides of the main arch. *Giovanni Battista Maganza the Younger: Dead Christ with Mary and Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist and Saint Nicholas Bishop, 1615, in the left transept (once in the Jesuati Church). *Alessandro Maganza: The Trinity with the Blessed Giovanni Colombini and San Carlo Borromeo, 1612, left transept (once in the Jesuati Church). *Giovanni Battista Maganza the Elder: St. Jerome penitent, 1570, Winter Chapel of The Divine Mercy and St. Jerome (once in the Jesuati Church).

It is a brick building in the Georgian Revival style designed by Hunt & Hunt in the early 20th century, one of the few mansions left of many that lined Broadway in the era it was built. Also on the property is a wood frame carriage house that predates it slightly. Note: This includes and Accompanying four photographs Both buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Edward Harden had earned fame and fortune as the Chicago Tribune reporter who broke the story of Admiral George Dewey's victory in the Battle of Manila Bay. He later left journalism for finance, and after earning a seat on the New York Stock Exchange commissioned the house. Shortly after it was built, he allowed part of the home to be used for a new kindergarten that was the first Montessori school in the U.S. The Harden family later moved to nearby Scarborough. It was used as a home for retired seamstresses and, in the middle of the century, sold to the local school district, which continues to use it as its main offices today. Building The mansion is located atop a small hill on the east side of Broadway, adjacent to Patriot's Park, listed on the Register as the site where John Andr√© was captured during the Revolutionary War, exposing Benedict Arnold's espionage for the British. On the east property line is the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark. The house straddles the municipal boundary between Sleepy Hollow and neighboring Tarrytown. It and the park are the transitional area between the densely developed downtown sections of the two communities, to the west, and residential areas to the east, marked by tall mature trees sheltering houses on large lots. Sleepy Hollow High School and the district's middle school are to the north and the elementary John Paulding School is to the south. A drive leads up from Broadway, curving south to a parking lot to the southwest. Another large parking lot is in the rear. The main house itself is a brick- faced nine-by-five-bay structure, two and a half stories tall with dormer windows and brick chimneys piercing its hip roof. On the north and south end are two-story, three-bay flat-roofed wings faced in decorative woodwork. A one-story service wing is on the rear, and an open porch on a stonework foundation with an iron railing runs along the ground floor of the west (front) facade, wrapping around both porches. All windows on the seven bays of the main block's west facade are double-hung sash, 20-over-1 on the first floor (except for modern, narrower one-over-one on the northwest corner) and 15-over-15 upstairs. Some have projecting window air conditioner units. They have marble sills and splayed brick lintels with marble keystones. Recessed panels are worked into the brick between the two stories; the corners are quoined. At the roofline is a modillioned, dentilled cornice. The small six- over-six double-hung sash in the five dormers are topped with pedimented gables. From the center of the south facade the porch projects. It is a three- by-three-bay two-story wooden extension with a flat roof. Corner pilasters support a frieze with molded dentils. On the first story all windows are small six-over-six double-hung sash, replacing the original French windows. They are within semicircular arches supported by paneled pilasters. On the second floor the 12-over-12 double-hung sash form balconettes. Above it three more gabled dormers pierce the roof. The north porch is similar but smaller, recessed slightly into the corner. Both porches are flanked on the main block by windows with the same treatment as the corresponding windows on the west facade. On the northeast corner, the service wing has a flat roof, windows in a variety of configurations, and an entrance porch. The east facade runs the full nine bays since it includes the rear of the north porch. Its windows are the same as the others on the house. In its center is a recessed three-bay two-story entrance porch, the house's original front entrance, creating three- bay flanking pavilions with two smooth columns on either side supported by sandstone Composite capitals. In the center bay the entrance has its original stained wooden single-panel door with narrow pilasters and leaded glass sidelights and transom. Similar columns flank the west entrance, which is topped by a single-bay pedimented segmental-arched porch. The door itself has been replaced with a modern one; its overhead transom has been filled in as well. It opens into a large entrance hall with a staircase reported to have been brought from a genuine Colonial house in Boston. The walls that once separated the dining room on the north and drawing room on the south have been removed. Many original finishes remain, such as the plaster walls and ceilings; wood, plaster and marble fireplace mantels and black walnut woodwork in other places. The bathrooms upstairs retain their white tile floors. The carriage house is a one-and-a-half-story wood frame building at the northeast corner of the property. It has a clipped gable roof, bracketed eaves and a small cupola. Its windows are double-hung sash in a variety of configurations. History In 1898, then 29-year-old Chicago Tribune business editor Edward Harden was riding along on the USS Hugh McCulloch, a revenue cutter, when it was summoned to join the Asiatic Squadron under the command of Commodore George Dewey, as the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. He was one of three reporters who witnessed Dewey's victory in the Battle of Manila Bay, the first by the U.S. Navy over a foreign fleet since the War of 1812. From Hong Kong he was able to scoop the other two by paying the telegraph operator with a bag of gold to expedite the dispatch to his paper. It reached the United States ahead of Dewey's official report, which had been sent first, and even President William McKinley found out when the Tribune's editor awoke him with the news. Seven years later, after service as a special commissioner in the Philippines and editor of the Chicago Journal, he left journalism for finance and business. He was successful enough as a stock trader to earn a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, and married Ruth Vanderlip, sister of Frank Vanderlip, Assistant Treasury Secretary during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and later president of National City Bank. The couple and their children were drawn to the Tarrytowns, where many other prominent wealthy families of the time lived. They commissioned Hunt & Hunt, a firm run by the sons of Richard Morris Hunt, to design the house in what was then known as North Tarrytown, in 1909. Harden bought four acres (), which included the carriage house, likely built for a predecessor house. The architects chose the new Georgian Revival style for the building, which was widely covered by New York and Chicago newspapers. Harden was aware of the Revolutionary-era history of the nearby land, and may have chosen an 18th-century revival style to reflect this. He collected memorabilia related to John Andr√©, a collection held today by the Tarrytown Historical Society, and later bought the land for use as a public park. After two years at the mansion, the school was moved to the Vanderlips' property in nearby Briarcliff Manor, where it became the Scarborough School. Among its later students were some of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's grandchildren. The Hardens, too, moved to Scarborough in 1926, supposedly finding Broadway had become \\"too noisy\\". It was sold to the estate of Margaret Howard, an Irish immigrant who had become a millionaire dressmaker in New York. She had directed in her will that a large amount of money be used to purchase and maintain a home for retired seamstresses like those who had worked for her, an unusual idea at the time. Two years after the sale, in 1928, the Sisters of Mercy managed the home as the first residents moved in. The seamstresses kept busy, sewing uniforms for American troops during World War II. Ten years after the war, in 1955, the house was sold to the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, which converted it slightly. The mansion to the north had already been used as the basis for a private boys' school, the building that is now Sleepy Hollow High School. Later the southern mansion became John Paulding School, named for one of the local militiamen who had apprehended Andr√© nearby. The district has continued to use it as its administration building.

Argentina An ice cream cone in Salta, Argentina While industrial ice cream exists in Argentina and can be found in supermarkets, restaurants or kiosks, and ice cream pops are sold on some streets and at the beaches, the most traditional Argentine helado (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, rather than US-style ice cream, and it has become one of the most popular desserts in the country. Among the most famous manufacturers are \\"Freddo,\\" \\"Persicco,\\" \\"Chungo\\", \\"Cremolatti\\" and \\"Munchi's,\\" all of them located in Buenos Aires. Each city has its own helader√≠as (ice cream parlours) which offer different varieties of creamy and water-based ice creams, including both standard and regional flavours. There are hundreds of flavors but Argentina's most traditional and popular one is dulce de leche, which has become popular abroad, especially in the US. There are two kinds of helader√≠as in Argentina: the cheaper ones which sell ice cream with artificial ingredients (like Helarte, Pirulo, Sei Tu and the largest one, Grido), and the ones that sell helado artesanal, made with natural ingredients and usually distinguished by a logo featuring an ice cream cone and the letters HA. There are no regulations in Argentina regarding the amount of milk an ice cream can have. In fact, all ice cream parlors serve both cream-based and water-based ice cream (helado a la crema and helado al agua respectively). Instead, the distinctions are made according to the quality of the ingredients. A standard Argentine cone or cup contains two different flavours of ice cream. In addition to these, most helader√≠as offer ice-cream-based desserts like Bomb√≥n Suizo (Swiss Bonbon: chocolate-covered chantilly ice cream filled with dulce de leche and sprinkled with nuts), Bomb√≥n Escoc√©s (Scottish Bonbon: same as the Swiss Bonbon, only with chocolate ice-cream and white chocolate topping), Cassata (strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream) and Almendrado (almond ice cream sprinkled with almond praline). Australia and New Zealand An ice cream van at Batemans Bay, New South Wales, Australia Per capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year. Brands include Tip Top, Streets, Peters, Sara Lee, New Zealand Natural, Cadbury, Baskin-Robbins and Bulla Dairy Foods. A popular ice cream flavour in New Zealand, Australia and Japan that originated in New Zealand is hokey pokey. China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Besides the popular flavour such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers also introduced other traditional flavours such as black sesame, red beans. In recent years, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan dessert houses also serve ice-cream moon cake during the Mid-Autumn festival (moon festival). Fried ice cream is served at street food stalls in Beijing. Cuba Interior of the landmark Coppelia ice cream parlor, Havana, Cuba In Cuba, ice cream is sold at the state-run Coppelia chain of ice cream parlors. Coppelia was founded in 1966 by Fidel Castro, his aim to introduce his love of dairy products to the Cuban masses and to prove that a communist enterprise could provide better ice cream and flavor selection than American brands. In the capital Havana, the Coppelia parlor is an architectural icon and a major landmark and meeting place in the city. In 2012, the Cuban newspaper Trabajadores exposed the short supply, poor service, and melted ice cream served at the landmark.\\"A California Architect Visits Cuba\\", Patrick McGrew, KCET-TV (PBS Los Angeles), August 8, 201Sundred Suzarte Medina, \\"Con bolas huecas no hay jonr√≥n\\", Trabajadores, April 1, 2012 Finland The first ice cream manufacturer in Finland was the Italian Magi family, who opened the Helsingin j√§√§tel√∂tehdas in 1922 and Suomen Eskimo Oy. Other manufacturers soon spawned, like Pietarsaaren j√§√§tel√∂tehdas (1928‚Äì2002). Finland's first ice cream bar opened at the Lasipalatsi in 1936, and at the same time another manufacturer, Maanviljelij√§in Maitokeskus started their production. Today, the two largest ice cream manufacturers are Ingman and Nestl√© (who bought Valioj√§√§tel√∂). Finland is also the leading consumer of ice cream in Europe, with 13.7 litres per person in 2003. France In 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream caf√© in Paris and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 caf√©s opened in Paris. Some people eat heart or log shaped cakes made of ice cream on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day. Germany Spaghettieis, a German ice cream dish made to look like a plate of Spaghetti. One of the first well known Italian ice cream parlors (Eisdiele) was founded in Munich in 1879 and run by the Sarcletti family. This traditional family business was handed from generation to generation ever since. Since the 1920s, when many Italians immigrated and set up business, the traditional ice cream parlors became very popular. A popular German ice cream dish is Spaghettieis, created by Dario Fontanella in the 1960s and made to look like a plate of spaghetti. About 80% percent of the ice cream sold in Germany is produced industrially, with the leading manufacturer being Unilever. About 17% is produced commercially and the remaining 3% is produced for the soft serve sector. In 2013, Germany had the largest market for ice cream in Europe at $2.7 billion revenue. Ghana In 1962,:: Fan Milk Limited :: - The Company the Ghanaian treat FanIce was created by the Fan Milk Limited Company. FanIce comes in strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. FanMilk also makes additional products, though FanIce is the closest to Western ice cream. Pouches of FanIce and other FanMilk products can be bought from men on bikes equipped with chill boxes in any moderately sized town, and in cities large enough for grocery stores. FanMilk can also be bought in tubs for eating at home. In 2006, FanMilk was voted best ice-cream in the world. Greece An ice cream shop in Lefkada Ice cream in its modern form, or pagot√≥ (), was introduced in Greece along its development in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Earlier than that, ice treats have been enjoyed in the country since ancient times. During the 5th century BC, ancient Greeks ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. The father of modern medicine, Hippocrates, encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice \\"as it livens the lifejuices and increases the well- being.\\" In the 4th century BC, it was well known that a favorite treat of Alexander the Great was snow ice mixed with honey and nectar. In the modern Day Greek ice cream has been heavily influenced by Turkish Ice cream Dondurma thus the name used to be called Dudurmas but, because of Greco-Turkish relations most Turkish related foods are coined a more Greek idiom. Greek ice cream recipes have some unique flavours such as Pagoto Kaimaki (), made from mastic-resin which gives it an almost chewy texture, and Salepi, used as a thickening agent to increase resistance to melting, both giving a unique taste to the ice cream; Pagoto Elaeolado me syko (), made of olive oil and figs; Pagoto Kataifi cocoa (), made from the shredded filo dough pastry that resembles angel's hair pasta, similar to vermicelli but much thinner; and Pagoto Mavrodaphne (), made from a Greek dessert wine. Fruity Greek Sweets of the Spoon are usually served as toppings with Greek-inspired ice cream flavors. India India is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically. India also has a domestic ice cream product known as \\"Kulfi\\" or \\"Matka Kulfi\\", which is famous in small towns and villages. Major brands are AMUL, Havmor, Kwality, Vadilal, Mother Dairy, Sadguru Dadarwale etc.http://www.euromonitor.com/ice-cream-in- india/reporthttp://www.thecolorsofindia.com/interesting-facts/business/india- largest-selling-icecream.html In recent times, many domestic ice cream companies have opened their exclusive outlets in metros and several international ice-cream companies also started their operation in India. Indonesia In Indonesia there is a type traditional ice cream called \\"Es Puter\\" or \\"stirred ice cream\\". It's made from some ingredients: coconut milk, pandanus leaves and sugar, with flavouring: avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, mung bean or other various flavors. Iran FƒÅl≈´de (Persian: ŸÅÿßŸÑŸàÿØŸá) or PƒÅl≈´de (Persian: ŸæÿßŸÑŸàÿØŸá) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles frozen with corn starch, rose water, lime juice, and often ground pistachios. It is a traditional dessert in Iran and Afghanistan. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal period. The faloodeh of Shiraz is famous. Faloodeh is one of the earliest forms of frozen desserts, having existed as early as 400 BC. Ice was brought down from high mountains and stored in tall refrigerated buildings called yakhchals, which were kept cool by windcatchers. There is also a drink called faloodeh, but it is made using other ingredients. Italy A gelato stall on Ponte Vecchio, Florence Italian ice cream or Gelato as it is known, is a traditional and a popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \\"produzione propria\\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7-8% fat. Before the cone became popular for serving ice cream, in English speaking countries, Italian street vendors would serve the ice cream in a small glass dish referred to as a \\"penny lick\\" or wrapped in waxed paper and known as a hokey-pokey (possibly a corruption of the Italian \\"ecco un poco\\" - \\"here is a little\\"). ‚Äî Forte presents this and several alternative hypotheses. Some of the most known artisanal gelato machine makers are Italian companies Carpigiani, Crm-Telme, Corema-Telme, Technogel, Cattabriga and high capacity industrial plants made by Catta 27 and Cogil and Teknoice. Japan Mochi ice cream sold in Japan Ice cream is a popular dessert in Japan, with almost two in five adults eating some at least once a week. From 1999 through 2006, the most popular flavors in Japan have been vanilla, chocolate, matcha (powdered green tea), and strawberry.Vanilla holds an unshakable top position in favorite ice cream flavours. , Japanese Ice Cream Association, Ice Cream White Paper 2006. Tokyo, Japan. Retrieved on 2006-10-21 (Japanese). Other notable popular flavours are milk, caramel, and azuki (red bean). Azuki is particularly favored by people in their 50s and older. Laos A typical variety is Laotian vanilla ice cream made from pandan (\\"Laotian vanilla\\"). Norway It is known that the Italian Giovanni Zazzera made and sold \\"iscrem\\" in Stavanger from 1910. He had been living in Oslo for five years before that, and could therefore have sold ice cream in Norway as early as 1905. Pakistan Pakistan's most popular ice cream brands include OMOR√â, the products of which are exported to Europe and America, Igloo and the British company Wall's Beside these other large ice cream brands from Pakistan include Eat More Ice Cream and Yummy. These companies receive most of their profit from within the country. Pakistani Peshawari ice cream is very famous in South Asia and Middle East. The most popular flavours in Pakistan are Pista, Qulfi (spelt also as \\"Qulfa\\", and in Punjabi with a \\"K-\\"), Vanilla and Chocolate. Philippines A woman purchasing strawberry sorbetes from a street vendor in the Philippines Sorbetes is a Philippine version for common ice cream usually peddled from carts that roam streets in the Philippines. This should not be confused with the known sorbet. It is also commonly called 'dirty ice cream' because it is sold along the streets exposing it to pollution and that the factory where it comes from is usually unknown; though it is not really \\"dirty\\" as the name implies. It is usually served with small wafer or sugar cones and recently, bread buns. A popular ice cream flavor in the Philippines is called ube ice cream made from ube (purple yam). Spain Ice cream, in the style of Italian gelato, can be found in many cafes or specialty ice cream stores throughout Spain. Usually the flavours reflect local tastes like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu. There are also industrial producers like Frigo (owned by Unilever), Camy (later merged into Nestl√©), Avidesa, Menorquina, many of them are part of transnational groups. The industrial producers also serve ice cream sandwiches and polos, ice cream on a stick, such as Magnum, sometimes with whimsical shapes like the foot-shaped Frigopi√©. Unlike in Northern Europe, ice cream is consumed mostly in summer. Hence, some ice cream stores become hot-chocolate caf√©s in winter. Syria Bakdash ice cream shop in the Al-Hamidiyah Souq in Old city of Damascus Booza ( in Arabic: \\"milk ice cream\\", also called \\"Arabic ice cream\\") is a mastic-based ice cream. It is elastic, sticky, and resistant to melting in the hotter climates of the Arab world, where it is most commonly found. The ice cream is usually and traditionally made with an ingredient called sahlab () or salep, which provides it with the ability to resist melting. Salep is also a primary ingredient in the Turkish version of this style of ice cream called dondurma. Turkey A man purchasing dondurma from a street vendor in Turkey Dondurma (in Turkish: Mara≈ü dondurmasƒ±, meaning \\"the ice cream of the city of Mara≈ü\\", also called D√∂vme dondurma, meaning \\"battered ice cream\\") is a Turkish mastic ice cream. It is similar to the Syrian dessert booza. Dondurma typically includes the ingredients cream, whipped cream, salep, mastic, and sugar. It is believed to originate from the city and region of Mara≈ü and hence also known as Mara≈ü ice cream.Naver Kowledgeins, \\"Turkey Ice-cream\\". Naver. 2004, February 8th. 24 April 2008 United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth ¬£1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009). A product may be sold as \\"ice cream\\" if it contains 5 per cent fat and not less than 2.5 per cent milk protein, but may contain non-milk vegetable fats and oils, usually hydrogenated palm kernel oil, a rule that is more permissive than many other countries. Only true ice cream made only with milk fats (though not necessarily cream) can be described as dairy ice cream, and many companies make sure that dairy is prominently displayed on their packaging and advertising.Schedule 8, the (UK) Food Labelling Regulations 1996 United States A woman in South Dakota holding a Dairy Queen Blizzard, a commercial mix-in In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \\"Philadelphia style\\" ice cream. Ice creams made with eggs, usually in the form of frozen custards, are sometimes called \\"French\\" ice creams or traditional ice cream. American federal labeling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat (about 7 grams (g) of fat per 1/2 cup [120 mL] serving), 20% total milk solids by weight, to weigh no less than 4.5 pounds per gallon (in order to put a limit on replacing ingredients with air), and to contain less than 1.4% egg yolk solids. Federal government regulations pertaining to the process of making ice cream, allowable ingredients, and standards, may be found in Part 135 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.21 CFR Part 13521 CFR ¬ß 135.110(a)(2). Americans consume about 23 liters of ice cream per person per year ‚Äî the most in the world. As a foodstuff it is deeply ingrained into the American psyche and has been available in America since its founding in 1776: there are records of Thomas Jefferson serving it as a then-expensive treat to guests at his home in Monticello. In American supermarkets it is not uncommon for ice cream and related products to take up a wall full of freezers. All different kinds of ice cream fill the walls with strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, among other flavors. Although chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry are the traditional favorite flavors of ice cream, and once enjoyed roughly equal popularity, vanilla has grown to be the most popular, most likely because of its use as a topping for fruit based pies and its use as the key ingredient for milkshakes. According to the International Ice Cream Association (1994), supermarket sales of ice cream break down as follows: vanilla, 28%; fruit flavours, 15%; nut flavours, 13.5%; candy mix-in flavours, 12.5%; chocolate, 8%; cake and cookie flavours, 7.5%; Neapolitan, 7%; and coffee/mocha, 3%. Other flavours combine to make 5.5%. Sales in ice cream parlors are more variable, as new flavours come and go, but about three times as many people call vanilla their favorite compared to chocolate, the runner- up.

Kingdom Acts are used for specific areas of law set out in the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands (e.g. nationality law, foreign affairs), or for those areas where countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands cooperate voluntarily. Field of application =Ordinary Kingdom Acts= Kingdom Acts are used in areas defined as Kingdom Affairs in the Charter for the Kingdom: * maintenance of the independence and the defence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; * foreign relations; * Netherlands nationality; * regulation of the orders of chivalry, the flag and the coat of arms of the Kingdom; * regulation of the nationality of vessels and the standards required for the safety and navigation of seagoing vessels flying the flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the exception of sailing ships; * supervision of the general rules governing the admission and expulsion of Netherlands nationals; * general conditions for the admission and expulsion of aliens; * extradition. One additional Kingdom Affair is specified in article 43(2) of the Charter: * The safeguarding of fundamental human rights and freedoms, legal certainty and good governance shall be a Kingdom Affair. An example of a Kingdom Act is the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands Nationality. =Consensus Kingdom Acts= On the basis of article 38 of the Charter, the countries of the Kingdom can decide to adopt a Kingdom Act outside of the scope of the aforementioned areas. Such acts are referred to as Consensus Kingdom Acts, as they require the consent of the parliaments of Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten (before 2010: Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles; before 1986: the Netherlands Antilles; from 1954 to 1975: Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles). An example of a Consensus Kingdom Act is the Kingdom Act on Financial Supervision of the Constituent Countries Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten, which was adopted as part of the package of legislation pertaining to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. Legislation process Kingdom Acts are generally proposed by the Government of the Netherlands, after discussion in the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom (which consists of the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands together with the ministers-plenipotentiary of Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten respectively). Obligatory advice is obtained from the Council of State of the Kingdom (which is the Council of State of the Netherlands, with added advisers, one for every other country). After this advice a (revised) proposal is sent to the States-General of the Netherlands and the estates of the three other countries. When Aruba, Cura√ßao or Sint Maarten does not agree with the proposed Kingdom Act, then the country can increase the majority needed for approval in the States-General to 5/9 of the votes. After approval in both houses of the States-General, the Act receives royal assent. In the case of Consensus Kingdom Acts, the act also has to be approved by the Estates of the relevant other countries.

He died, aged 66, at Pimlico 14 October 1842. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Though Americans remember him for his Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States, published in 1809, Kendall's main claim to fame are his books for children, in which he represented the characters of animals in new ways, giving them a speaking voice. Whilst there were other writers, including Dorothy Kilner, Sarah Trimmer, Anna Laetitia Barbauld and her brother John Aikin, who made smaller contributions, Kendall played a major and crucial part in shifting the representation of animals in literature from the fabulous, the allegorical and the satirical to the naturalistic and empathetic. His Keeper's Travels in Search of His Master, Crested Wren, and Burford Cottage and its Robin Red Breast, are the natural predecessors of Water Babies and The Wind in the Willows. Employing new narrative techniques for representing thought in fiction, Kendall pioneered writers' attempts to imagine and describe the experiences of animals. During 1807 and 1808, Kendall travelled through the northern parts of the United States, as a result of which he published his historically important three-volume topographical dictionary Travels through the northern parts of the United States. Following this, Kendall spent a number of years in Canada working for the Hudson's Bay Company; after which spent time in British India and the Cape Colony. Following his return to England, in 1817 Kendall issued proposals for establishing in London a philanthropic institution to be called The Patriotic Metropolitan Colonial Institution, to assist new settlers to British colonies. He also proposed to form new and distinct colonies for the descendants of mixed raced Anglo Indians, and mixed race West Indians, who early in the nineteenth century were already finding themselves outcast by both the white and ethnic communities. In the same publication, he also proposed the formation of Free Schools of Chemistry and Mathematics, principally to provide a free library for the education of the poor. In 1819, Kendall started The Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review, which continued until 1828, when it was incorporated into the Athenaeum. Kendall went on to found The Olio, or Museum of Entertainment, which ran to eleven volumes from 1828-1833. His Letters to a Friend, 1836, is a vitriolic on Irish Catholicism, in which he assured the Irish that they lived under a vigorous and paternal government. The duty of that government, he insisted, was to repress Roman Catholicism in Ireland as well as in Great Britain. In 1815, Kendall published a translation of Louis Bonaparte's Marie, ou Les peines de l'amour, as Marie, or the Hollanders. The Preface is simply signed E. A. K., but the Longman Divide Ledger 2D, p. 76, tells us that Mr Kendall received the payment of ¬£31. 10. 0. as the Translator. Towards the end of his life, Kendall wrote The English Boy at the Cape, one of the first novels to be set in South Africa.

Contest over the imamate Ali bin Salah ad-Din was a son of the preceding imam an-Nasir Muhammad Salah ad-Din who had held extensive power in highland Yemen. He grew up in San'a, the most important city of the realm. After an-Nasirs sudden demise in 1391, no less than four claimants to the imamate appeared, foremost among them the learned al-Mahdi Ahmad bin Yahya. The young Ali eventually prevailed. He was proclaimed imam under the name al- Mansur Ali, with the support of the scholars and population of San'a. However, a rival imam called al-Hadi Ali had some support in the northern parts of the Zaidi territory from 1393 to 1432. Due to the unrest, al-Mansur Ali had to travel frequently to trouble spots. He had to fight hard to gain control over Sa'dah, the traditional centre of Zaidi power in the north. Various strongholds of the Tayyibi Isma'ili sect were taken, and their leader Ali Shams al-Din II was forced out of Dhu Marmar, a fortress to the east of San'a. Idris Imad al-Din with the Rasulid dynasty Sultan al-Malik al-Zahir (r. 1428‚Äì1439) repeatedly fought against the Zaydi imam al-Mansur Ali (r. 1391‚Äì1436), and recaptured numerous fortresses from Zaydi control.Zaidi biographies, http://www.al-aalam.com/personinfo.asp?pid=638 (in Arabic). In Zaidi historiography, the imam is celebrated as a mujaddid bi-sayfihi, a warlike restorer. That his bellicose exploits sometimes afflicted other Zaidi Muslims did not detract from his reputation. Al-Mansur Ali's rule over San'a was never in danger, but in 1395 he sacked the qadi in the city, who had been found to correspond with the Rasulid Dynasty in the lowland. Two years later he made a diplomatic foray when he sent offerings to the Rasulid Sultan al- Ashraf Isma'il I in Zabid. The offerings consisted of \\"five loads of articles esteemed as rarities, and five head of horses of good lineages\\".El-Khazreji, The Pearl-Strings; A History of the Resuli dynasty, Vol. II. Leiden 1908, pp. 258-9. Later reign and death In 1403 a tribal army from Hamdan moved towards San'a. The imam swiftly attacked the enemy force outside the city and routed the tribesmen. Shaykh Idris al-Hamdani asked for peace, but al-Mansur Ali refused to listen. Instead, he ravaged the Hamdani lands extensively, until the local shaykhs appeared again to ask for a stop of the hostilities. A peace was eventually concluded, on the condition that the Hamdanis ceded Hisn al-Munaqqab and al-Masna'ah.Robert Wilson, Gazetteer of Historical North-West Yemen. Hildesheim 1989, p. 57. Some time after these events, al-Mansur Ali concluded a truce with the Rasulids.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 66. Towards the end his reign, especially after 1424, Rasulid power began to crumble when a number of short- lived sultans succeeded each other on the throne. In 1436, Yemen was ravaged by the plague, and one of the victims was al-Mansur Ali. He died in San'a and was buried in the Salah ad-Din Mosque, constructed by his father. The son of the deceased imam, an-Nasir Muhammad, took power but succumbed as well after just 28 days.Zaidi biographies, http://www.al- aalam.com/personinfo.asp?pid=6787 (in Arabic). After that, no less than three rival imams appeared, of whom al-Mansur an-Nasir tried to anchor his legitimacy by marrying the granddaughter of al-Mansur Ali.Enzyklop√§die des Islam, Vol III, 1936, p. 1219.

Adventist HealthCare White Oak Medical Center operates as part of Adventist HealthCare, a health-care company that includes hospitals, home health agencies and other health care services. Adventist HealthCare is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The hospital partners with the Food and Drug Administration, also located in White Oak, to collaborate on health research and medical innovation. Adventist HealthCare White Oak Medical Center will maintain robust medical and health services at its Takoma Park location including behavioral health services, a primary care clinic, physician offices, rehabilitation services and a Federally Qualified Health Center operated by Community Clinic, Inc. History A photo of The Washington Sanitarium taken between 1910 and 1926. When Washington Sanitarium first opened in 1907, it was Montgomery County‚Äôs first cardiac center. Today, more than 400 open-heart surgeries and 5,000 interventional cardiology procedures are performed annually at the hospital. The founding of Washington Sanitarium by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1907 was the beginning of the Adventist HealthCare system. After World War I, the Washington Sanitarium began its transition from a long-term to an acute-care facility. It changed its name to Washington Sanitarium and Hospital and added an acute-care hospital building for surgical, obstetric and emergency cases. Next to the sanitarium, the Adventist Church built a college now called Washington Adventist University. The first group of nurses graduated from the hospital in 1909; nurses later received their training at the college, a program that will expand with the School of Health Professions, Science and Wellness, a partnership with Washington Adventist Hospital and Adventist HealthCare, to increase the number of health care professionals in Maryland. Dr. Lauretta Kress, wife of the hospital‚Äôs medical director, Dr. Daniel Kress, was the first female surgeon in Montgomery County. In 1916, she opened a maternity ward and during her hospital career delivered more than 5,000 babies. In 1940, the hospital added the Lisner wing; 10 years later, it added a six-story addition. A special procedures room was built in 1959 to study the heart, kidneys, brain and other organs. In 1962, the Intensive Care Unit, the second to operate in a metropolitan hospital, opened. A Maternity Department Labor Rate Card from the Washington Sanitarium and Hospital from 1968 The hospital built a $14 million five-story wing and changed its name to Washington Adventist Hospital in 1973. Developments over the next decades included the opening of a Short Stay Surgery Unit in 1977 and a critical care modernization in the early 1990s. Washington Adventist Hospital opened the first Chest Pain Center in the D.C. area in 1992. Former Adventist HealthCare Washington Adventist Hospital In 2005, the hospital created a Vision for Expanded Access to address inequalities in access to health care. As part of the vision, Adventist HealthCare created the Center on Health Disparities In October 2014, as part of a branding initiative to emphasize the Adventist HealthCare system name, the hospital's name changed from Washington Adventist Hospital to Adventist HealthCare Washington Adventist Hospital. To ensure access to health care for the under-served in the community, Washington Adventist Hospital has partnered with several community organizations including the Mercy Health Clinic, Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care and CASA de Maryland's Multicultural Center in Langley Park. The Center on Health Disparities also works to train interpreters as Qualified Bilingual staff that are available to assist patients and their families who may not speak English, during a medical encounter. In August 2019 Adventist HealthCare Washington Hospital changed its name and moved, when students and faculty from Howard University helped to move 76 patients and equipment to the newly built Adventist HealthCare White Oak Medical Center. Medical services The hospital provides medical and non-medical services for men and women. Medical services include cardiology, maternity services, orthopedics, oncology, radiology, wound care, surgical services, special care services, and emergency services. =Cardiac and vascular services= Washington Adventist Hospital expanded its cardiac services in 2010, adding a new medical director of cardiac surgery and team of surgeons from Cardiac Vascular and Thoracic Surgery Associates (CVTSA) Washington Adventist Hospital was the first in the region to perform open- heart surgery and numerous cardiac procedures, including mitral valvuloplasty, and the first in the mid-Atlantic to perform a revolutionary type of surgery called Mini- Maze that can correct atrial fibrillation (AF), a common form of heart rhythm abnormality and a major cause of stroke. Washington Adventist Hospital also claims to be a recognized leader in the transradial approach to cardiac catheterizations, which allows interventional cardiologists to use an artery in the wrist to gain access to heart arteries. In November 2013, the hospital became the first Transradial Catheterization Training Center in Maryland, allowing physicians from around the country to learn from Washington Adventist Hospital cardiologists how to perform this innovative, interventional heart procedure. Washington Adventist Hospital‚Äôs board- certified cardiologists, electrophysiologists, interventional radiologists and cardiac and vascular surgeons provide the following cardiac and vascular care. * ECG, holter monitoring, stress testing * Vascular ultrasound * Nuclear medicine * Magnetic resonance anteriography (MRA) * CT imaging * Angiography * Emergent and routine abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) stent graft * Carotid stenting * Arterial embolization * Full spectrum of cardiac surgery ** Bypass Surgery ** Beating Heart Surgery ** Aortic Valve Surgery ** Mitral Valve Surgery ** Tricuspid Valve Surgery ** Thoracic Aortic Procedures ** Atrial Fibrillation (Maze) Surgery ** Endoscopic Vein Harvesting ** Cardiac Tumor Registry * Full spectrum of vascular surgery * Comprehensive electrophysiology service * Catheter ablation * Pacemaker and defibrillator implants * Monitored Cardiac Rehabilitation * Cardiac and Vascular Research through the Center for Cardiac and Vascular Research (CCVR) * Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) * Primary PCI- an early life-saving medical procedure for heart attack patients =Center for Cardiac and Vascular Research= The Center for Cardiac & Vascular Research (CCVR) actively enrolls subjects in a variety of clinical research studies based on each subject‚Äôs needs.

Opened in 1911, it forms part of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome, Rome‚ÄìCapranica‚ÄìViterbo and Rome‚ÄìFiumicino railways. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Roma Trastevere railway station is situated at Piazza Flavio Biondo, southwest of the city centre. It is at the southern end of the Trastevere district, close to the districts of Marconi and Portuense. History The original Roma Trastevere railway station was more centrally located, at Piazza Ippolito Nievo. That station replaced the Roma Porta Portese railway station, which had been opened on 24 April 1859, upon the inauguration of the Rome‚ÄìCivitavecchia section of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway. The present station was opened on 1 May 1911, together with minor deviations of both the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway and the Rome‚ÄìCapranica‚ÄìViterbo railway. The old station continued to operate until 1950 as a goods yard and rolling stock workshop. Its site is now occupied by the FS Experimental Institute. In recent years, the present station has been the subject of renovations and improvements commissioned by Centostazioni. Features View of the platforms Roma Trastevere's passenger building was designed by Paolo Bo. It is a large structure made up of several conjoined sections, ranging from two to four storeys in height. The ground floor level of the central section provides various facilities to passengers. The station has six through tracks faced by platforms fitted with shelters and connected by a subway. Operationally, it was previously classified as a junction station, but in 1990 it was downgraded to the status of a stopping point. Today, the Ferrovie regionali del Lazio FR1, FR3 and FR5 commuter lines all pass through the station, which is also planned to be an interchange with the proposed Line D of the Metropolitana di Roma.

The machine was to be designed by –ê–û–û–¢ \\"–í–≠–ª–ù–ò–ò\\" (VELNII) and –ê–û–û–¢ –ù–ü–û \\"–ù–≠–í–ó\\" (NEVZ), in association with a foreign company, and manufactured by VELNII with an expected schedule of prototype delivery in 1997 and series production in 1999. The prototype was unveiled at Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant (NEVZ) on 20 November 1998. Initially it was expected that DC and AC only versions –≠–ü2 (EP2) and –≠–ü3 (EP3) would be developed based on the asynchronous traction technology introduced in the EP10.Sources:  Certification testing was complete in February 2005. An order for 11 locomotives was placed in 2005 with Transmashholding and Bombardier Transportation; locomotives No.2 & 3 began production in 2005. The order was valued at 450 million rubles; RZD initially refused to place an order for the type, citing the high unit price. In 2006 RZD chief engineer Valentin Gapanovich stated that only 12 of the class would be procured, and described it as a –Ω–µ —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–π –ª–æ–∫–æ–º–æ—Ç–∏–≤ (English: not very promising), though the railway had increased it requirement for dual system locomotives. Instead he announced that Transmashholding would be seeking a foreign company to create a joint venture to manufacture a new design - the –≠–ü20 (EP20), with an expected order of 230 units or more. Design The mechanical design (body, bogies.) of the prototype locomotive was by VELNII and NEVZ, and based on the VL65 locomotive type, the electrical part (semiconductor converters, control system, transformer.) was based on designs owned by Adtranz, including the 460 series and DB Class 145. The locomotives operate from both 3 kV DC and 25 kV 50 Hz AC using asynchronous motors for traction. Main design features included frame supported traction motors, supply conversion using a four-quadrant rectifier, with intermediate DC link to a GTO based inverter, and microprocessor based control and diagnostic equipment. The locomotives use water (60% ethylene glycol.) cooled MITRAC TC3100 type inverters,) rated at 2500 kW. Each converter supplies two parallel connected traction motors; The traction motors are three phase induction designs with two sets of 'half' windings for each phase: an individual traction unit includes 8 four-quadrant converters (4QC), and two asynchronous motors. Under DC supply (3 kV, up to 4 kV peak) two three-phase inverter blocks are connected in series; each inverter block supplies one set of 'half' windings on two parallel connected motors. When under 25 kV AC the high voltage supply is stepped down to 2.8 kV, and rectified by four-quadrant converters to an intermediate DC link, which supplies an inverter block powering two parallel connected motors, with the 'half' windings connected in series. The design has an efficiency of up to 86% on AC supply, 88% on DC supply. Operating temperature range is .

The manuscript is currently dated by the INTF to the 11th century. It was held in Corfu, then it came to the \\"Dawes Collection\\" (as first volume; second volume belonged to 2278, the third to 2279). On 15 October 1904 it was bought for the British Museum. It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Gregory (816e). Gregory saw it 18 May 1886 during his visit in Greece. On 17 October 1904 Gregory saw this manuscript in the British Museum and catalogued again under the siglum 2277. This time he assigned age of the manuscript for the 11th century. Second description is more detailed. Kurt Aland recognized that numbers 816 and 2277 belongs to the same manuscript and number 816 was deleted from the list; number 2277 is used as siglum for this manuscript.

This work of popular romanticism is crucially important in marking the great change in the representation of animals in literature, from the fabulous, the allegorical and the satirical to the naturalistic and the empathetic. By employing new narrative techniques for representing thought in fiction, Kendall pioneered writers' attempts to imagine and describe the experiences of animals. In Keeper's Travels, the main character, Keeper, is given a speaking voice.

A list of the cast from the original ITV series, which ran from 1970 to 1975, can be found here. Upstairs =Sir Hallam Holland, Bart.= Portrayed by Ed Stoppard, Sir Hallam Holland is a Foreign Office diplomat, who inherited 165 Eaton Place as well as a large fortune and a baronetcy. He is married to Lady Agnes Holland, who has given birth to two children, Hector and Veronica. Sir Hallam's relationship with Lady Agnes is tested during series 2 when she becomes friendly with an American tycoon, Casper Landry. Hallam's jealousy compiled with the stress he is under at work leads him to kissing Agnes's sister, Persie. The kiss eventually leads to a full blown affair between the two. =Lady Agnes Holland= Portrayed by Keeley Hawes, Lady Agnes Holland (n√©e Towyn) is the eldest daughter of the 12th Earl of Towyn and wife of Sir Hallam. Her \\"old money\\" family were impoverished, and Agnes grew up in a decaying castle in the south of Wales. Her marriage to Sir Hallam has been happy and devoted, despite financial hardship before his inheritance and their failure to have children. She now has two children with Sir Hallam and has since been told that she cannot have any more. In light of the sad news she held a dinner party whose guests included a young John F. Kennedy and American businessman Casper Landry. =Maud, Lady Holland= Portrayed by Dame Eileen Atkins, Maud Holland (n√©e Mottershead), Lady Holland, born in 1860, is Sir Hallam's mother and is often seen to be causing friction between herself and Lady Agnes. She helped build the British Raj, and lived overseas for many years, returning to England after being widowed. She often lamented her unhappy marriage to her late husband, Greville. By 1938, she has died and this leaves a hole in the Holland family.Blanche says that she and Maud shared a father, so Maud's maiden name must have been Mottershead. =Lady Persephone \\"Persie\\" Towyn= Portrayed by Claire Foy, Lady Persephone \\"Persie\\" Towyn is the younger sister of Lady Agnes. A fascist, she has an affair with Harry Spargo, but later leaves him and her family to go to Germany with Joachim von Ribbentrop as his mistress. She is absent from Eaton Place between series 1 and 2, maintaining only minimal contact with her family, but returns in December 1938 after the anti- Semitic violence in Germany escalates. She subsequently discovers she is pregnant by one of her German lovers, and has an abortion. She then has an affair with Sir Hallam. Exposed as a spy for the Nazis and left alone, she commits suicide‚Äîby throwing herself off the upper balcony onto the entrance hall floor‚Äîafter accidentally shooting Beryl with Sir Hallam's service pistol. =Pamela Holland= Portrayed by Sarah Gordy, Pamela Holland, is the younger sister of Sir Hallam. She has Down's syndrome and lives in an asylum. Initially, Sir Hallam believes that she died in childhood, but he comes across her while rescuing Lotte from the same asylum. Pamela still remembers and loves her brother and mother dearly, and she is later seen staying at her brother's house for Christmas. =Dr Blanche Mottershead= Portrayed by Alex Kingston, Blanche Mottershead, born in 1890, is the younger half-sister of the late Maud‚Äîbeing thirty years younger than Maud‚Äîand Sir Hallam's aunt. She arrived at 165 Eaton Place during Maud‚Äôs short final illness, and is still in situ after her death. She took the lead in helping relocate Jewish children after the breakout of antisemitic Nazism within Berlin, and is also a patron of the British Museum and an expert Egyptologist. Blanche has an affair with Lady Portia Airesford (portrayed by Emilia Fox) which ends badly. Downstairs =Rose Buck= Portrayed by Jean Marsh, Rose Buck was born to a servant on the Southwold estate where Lady Marjorie was born and raised. She is the head house parlour maid at Eaton Place from 1903 to 1919 (including a short stint as Elizabeth Kirbridge's lady's maid and between maid in Greenwich), and Virginia Bellamy's lady's maid from 1919 to 1930. During the war years she also works as a conductress. She returns to Eaton Place in 1936, and assumes the position of housekeeper. In 1938 she suffered a bout of TB and was absent from the house for a while. Lady Agnes visits a frail Rose who begs her to take her key to 165 as she does not feel she deserves it. In a touching moment, Lady Agnes reassures Rose that she is both wanted and needed there. At the end of the series, she goes with the Holland children as a nanny to protect them during the war‚Äîthe second war she has lived through in her lifetime. =Clarice Thackeray= Portrayed by Anne Reid. The house's cook, Clarice Thackeray is a widow. Passionate about her work, she expects the highest standards of herself and others. She follows the workings of high society through the pages of the Tatler. Romantic and affectionate by nature, she is also nosey, judgemental and a monumental snob. Mrs Thackeray comes to blows with Mr. Pritchard in series 2 when they share the running of downstairs in Rose's absence. It comes to a head when Mr. Prichard scolds her for calling a young John F. Kennedy \\"my dear\\" and she resigns in a fit of temper. After a brief stay at her nephew's she realises she belongs at 165 and returns to a smiling Mr. Pritchard. =Warwick Pritchard= Portrayed by Adrian Scarborough. Butler Warwick Pritchard is discreet and well spoken. Teetotal and highly strung, his exacting fa√ßade conceals deep kindness and real integrity. As the downstairs family settles in, he gradually becomes the moral centre of the household. His skills in service come from his several years of employment with the Cunard Line. As a former wartime ambulance man, he delivers Lady Agnes' baby with little fuss when she is unable to go to the hospital. It is later revealed he was raised a Quaker and was a conscientious objector during the Great War. This fact angers Mr. Amanjit and Mrs Thackeray and a rift emerges downstairs, however they soon forgive him after a talk from Lady Agnes. Mr. Pritchard and Mrs Thackeray have several fights during series 2 as they disagree on how downstairs should be run. He has a brief courtship with a lady's maid but she rejects him after finding out about his history in the war. Pritchard is revealed to be a recovered alcoholic and goes back to his habit, but has recovered by the time war is declared. =Eunice McCabe= Eunice, played by Ami Metcalf, is hired as kitchen maid between 1936 and 1938, and is an established member of the household by the start of series 2. She wears large round spectacles and has red hair. She is rather stupid at times, but has a lovable sense about her all the same. After Rose is taken ill, she acts as a lady's maid to Lady Agnes before her duties are reassigned to share time between the kitchen and nursery. =Beryl Spargo, n√©e Ballard= Beryl, portrayed by Laura Haddock, is the new nursery maid after Veronica is born but is soon re-allocated to the role of senior parlour maid. She is upset that she has to share a bed with Eunice and likes wearing lipstick. She gets into Mr Pritchard's bad books very quickly after she arrives and this comes to a head when she contacts a union about the long hours she and Eunice are expected to work and their poor living conditions. She falls in love with Harry and they plan to marry and emigrate to America but Beryl is accidentally shot by Persie before the latter commits suicide. Beryl and Harry are married in the final episode and decide to stay in England and help the war effort. =Amanjit Singh= Portrayed by Art Malik. Educated, gentle, and imposing, Amanjit Singh comes to Eaton Place as secretary to Maud, Lady Holland. Having been in her service in India for many years, he is devoted to her welfare. He served in the Indian Army in the First World War and was wounded at Ypres. In Series 2, Blanche's firm nature and apparent disregard for her late half-sister's memory initially causes friction with Mr Amanjit but when they work together to evacuate Jewish children from Germany they learn to respect each other and are soon friends. Sir Hallam gives Mr Amanjit his service pistol, entrusting him with protecting the Holland household in the event of a German invasion. =Ivy Morris= Portrayed by Ellie Kendrick. Just 15 years old, orphaned Ivy Morris is spirited, wilful, and likes red nail varnish and singing in the bath. Ivy would never willingly risk her newfound security at 165, but her hunger for love leads her, and others, into danger. She has a brief romance with Johnny. She has departed the house by 1938 for unknown reasons, and is not mentioned by any characters during series 2. =Harry Spargo= Portrayed by Neil Jackson. Full name Harold Herbert Spargo. Good-looking and cocksure, Harry Spargo enjoys his position as chauffeur for Hollands, but resents the social system that keeps him there. He enjoys a cautious camaraderie with Sir Hallam, but this was put to the test in 1936 by his involvement with Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. It was again put to the test in 1939 when Harry blackmailed Hallam over Hallam's affair with Persie, so he would give Harry the money for him and Beryl to emigrate to America. However, Persie accidentally shoots Beryl before committing suicide. Harry and Beryl are married in the final episode and decide to stay in England and help the war effort. Harry returns the money to his boss and Hallam says they will never mention it again. =Johnny Proude= Portrayed by Nico Mirallegro. Aged 16, Johnny Proude launches a career in domestic service in an effort to escape a life spent down the pit. Charming and hard-working, he is popular with the other servants‚Äîespecially Ivy‚Äîbut comes to 165 with a troubling secret: he is on probation. Johnny has turned 19 by the fifth episode of Series 2, as mentioned by Pritchard. In series 2, Harry trains him as a boxer but Johnny gives it up after a society playboy makes a pass at him. At the end of series 2 he is passed A1 (fit for military service) and expects to be called up any day. =Rachel Perlmutter= Portrayed by Helen Bradbury. Rachel Perlmutter is a German-Jewish refugee who comes to 165, as the new parlour maid, in May 1936. Reserved and sophisticated, having been a university lecturer in pre- Nazi Germany, Rachel knows little about basic household chores (though she has little tricks that surprise the rest of the staff), but is determined to make the best of her circumstances. Her husband has been imprisoned by the Nazis, for communist activities. She has a daughter, whose existence she keeps secret from her new employers. She forms a platonic relationship with Mr. Aminjit and he is the only one to whom she reveals the existence of her daughter. Rachel later dies from an asthma attack. =Lotte Perlmutter= Portrayed by Alexia James. Lotte Perlmutter is the daughter of Rachel, and when her mother dies of an asthma attack, she is taken into the Holland household as Sir Hallam's ward.

Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), is a decision of the US Supreme Court concerning the constitutionality of funding restrictions imposed by the US Congress. At issue were restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress. The restrictions prohibited LSC attorneys from representing clients attempting to amend (or challenge) existing welfare law. The case was brought by Carmen Velazquez, whose LSC-funded attorneys sought to challenge existing welfare provisions since they believed that it was the only way to get Velazquez financial relief. The Court ruled that the restrictions violated the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because LSC facilitated \\"private\\" speech, that of its grantees, the restrictions did not simply regulate government speech. Because the restrictions blocked attempts to change only a specific area of law, the Court held, they could not be considered viewpoint-neutral, and the government is prohibited from making such viewpoint-based restrictions of private speech. Reactions to the decision were mixed within Congress, with Republicans and Democrats disagreeing on the propriety of the decision. Several law review articles argued that the use of a \\"distortion principle\\" to decide violations of free speech was an unreasonable and unconstitutional rule whose conditions on funding might \\"distort\\" speech advocacy. Others contended that the Court mishandled the interpretation of the statute at issue. Background =History of funding restriction jurisprudence= The first major test of the federal government's power over funding restrictions based on speech was the 1991 case Rust v. Sullivan. In Rust, the Supreme Court had upheld a restriction on the use of Department of Health and Human Services funds for counseling, referring patients to, or advocating the use of abortion services. The Court reasoned that the restriction \\"merely [chose] to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.\\"531 U.S. at 541‚Äì543. Here, the government was using private speakers to transmit information about the government's own program.531 U.S. at 541‚Äì542. Six years later, the Court reviewed another restriction, this time about funding restrictions imposed by a public university. In the 1997 case Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, a government supported university sought to withhold funds from religious student publications although it funded similar secular publications. The Court said that the government could seek to shape funding to support a government message, such restrictive steps could not be imposed to the exclusion of a particular viewpoint.531 U.S. at 542. =Legal Services Corporation= In 1974 the United States Congress passed the Legal Services Corporation Act, which established the Legal Services Corporation. The purpose of the Act was to provide government-funded legal aid to indigent clients that would be funded through grants to regional entities throughout the country. In 1996, Congress amended the act with that year's appropriations bill, which imposed restrictions on the LSC. The restrictions included prohibitions against filing class action lawsuits, providing legal assistance to immigrants in particular types of cases, collecting attorney's fees, soliciting clients, providing advocacy training programs, and attempting to reform welfare laws. The restrictions affected only a small portion of the caseload.Houseman, Alan W. \\"What Can and Cannot Be Done: Representation of Clients by LSC-Funded Programs\\", \\"Center for Law and Social Policy,\\" August 9, 2001. The restrictions prohibited funding cases: > ... initiating legal representation or participating in any other way, in > litigation, lobbying, or rulemaking, involving an effort to reform a Federal > or State welfare system, except that this paragraph shall not be construed > to preclude a recipient from representing an individual eligible client who > is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not > involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law in > effect on the date of the initiation of the representation. =Lower-court proceedings= In 1997, Carmen Velazquez lost welfare benefits from the government under the provisions of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act (TANF). An attorney from an LSC grantee, Bronx Legal Services, litigated her claim. Bronx Legal Services, on behalf of Velazquez, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York to seek a declaration that the provision of the Act prohibiting challenges to existing welfare law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It argued that there was no way to help Velazquez without challenging the welfare system itself, and it sought to challenge the provisions under which Velazquez lost her benefits, a challenge that they could not make because of the 1996 restrictions.164 F.3d at 764 (2d Cir. 1999). The district court denied an injunction.164 F.3d at 762 (2d Cir. 1999). The court's decision was affirmed in part and reversed in part by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which unanimously held that the welfare-advocacy restriction was unconstitutional,531 U.S. 535 at 537 but upheld other restrictions that Bronx Legal Services had challenged (such as the lobbying restriction) by a 2‚Äì1 vote. The Second Circuit also rejected the claim that any funding conditions would be illegitimate by instead preferring a case-by-case analysis. LSC asked the Supreme Court for a review and argued that the Second Circuit had been wrong in striking only down the welfare-advocacy restriction.531 U.S. 535 at 537, 540. Supreme Court decision The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on October 4, 2000 and issued its decision four months later.531 U.S. at 535. The Court affirmed the decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals by holding 5-4 that the restriction on pursuing welfare advocacy was unconstitutional because of the First Amendment.531 U.S. at 549. alt=Justice Kennedy Justice Kennedy delivered the majority opinion. It distinguished a 1991 Supreme Court case, Rust v. Sullivan, which upheld a prohibition on federally funded family planning services from discussing abortion with their patients. The majority reasoned that in Rust, the government was attempting to use its funds to express its own message, but the purpose of the Act was to promote a diversity of private views with its funding, not an attempt to restrict any views. The Court said that the government can only issue \\"content-neutral\\" conditions on such speech and that the specific prohibition on welfare-reform litigation was viewpoint- based by restricting only support for welfare reform advocacy. \\"If the restriction on speech and legal advice were to stand, the result would be two tiers of cases... there would be lingering doubt whether the truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case, full advice to the client, and proper presentation to the court.\\"531 U.S. at 546. The Court also criticized the fact that the restriction functionally barred attorneys from participating in the courts.531 U.S. at 548. Any attorney receiving LSC funding would not be able to litigate welfare claims that challenged welfare rules, thereby preventing certain cases from being filed. \\"The restriction imposed by the statute here threatens severe impairment of the judicial function.... We must be vigilant when Congress imposes rules and conditions which, in effect, insulate its own laws from legitimate judicial challenge.\\" =Dissent= Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion from the decision of the Court and believed that Rust mandated a ruling upholding the restriction. Scalia was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Associate Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas and wrote, \\"The [act] is a federal subsidy program, not a federal regulatory program... regulations directly restrict speech; subsidies do not.\\" He disagreed with the majority's contention that there was viewpoint discrimination and argued that no specific viewpoint was restricted. Scalia was also concerned with dicta in the majority opinion that seemed to him to indicate a \\"fondness\\" for the concept of reform by using the courts.531 U.S. at 563. He argued that the majority's holding was \\"unprecedented\\" because it was the first time the government would be limited in advocating its own message. Reactions The immediate reaction was mixed among members of Congress. Democratic supporters of the decision were optimistic of future victories against funding restrictions and stated that they were glad the restriction had fallen but that the decision \\"opens the LSC up to even more attacks.\\" Republicans in Congress condemned the decision and agreeing to work against it. uS Representative Steve Largent (R-OK) said, \\"It'll be on the radar screen for sure.... Why are we giving taxpayer money to sue taxpayers?\\" The New York Times described the decision as the end of the \\"latest chapter, although almost certainly not the last, in a long political struggle over the federally financed program of civil legal services for the poor.\\" Parties involved in the case also had mixed reactions. LSC, which had sought to protect the restrictions, said that it would \\"immediately review [their] regulations and then modify them to adhere to the Court's ruling,\\" which it did quickly after the decision. Burt Neuborne, the lawyer who argued against the restriction before the Supreme Court, said that the ruling \\"really reads like a First Amendment textbook.\\" Subsequent developments In the weeks following the Velazquez decision, the Supreme Court rejected appeals related to other LSC restrictions. LSC has engaged in welfare-reform litigation since the original injunction was lifted. The case provided the basis for other challenges to restrictions imposed on LSC, such as bans against lobbying or class actions.Schwinn, Steven D. \\"Ninth Circuit Declines Further Review of Legal Services Funding Restrictions\\", Constitutional Law Prof Blog, June 4, 2010, accessed January 1, 2011 The challenges were rejected by the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit in separate suits.Oregon v. Legal Services Corp., 552 F. 3d 965 (9th Cir., 2009; dismissing challenge against restrictions)Brooklyn Legal Services Corp. v. Legal Services Corp., 462 F. 3d 219 (2nd Cir., 2006; dismissing challenge to attorney fee restriction) The challenges failed because the relevant provisions do not regulate a specific type of advocacy; for example, the restriction on LSC grantees from collecting attorney's fees would not raise a speech issue because there is no speech involved in such a process. The argument raised in those challenges was that the Court articulated a new \\"conditions\\" principle in Velazquez, a distortion- of-speech test, which they argued would require the restrictions to be struck down. Both courts of appeal reviewing that claim have rejected thar reading of Velazquez. Instead of a distortion-of-speech test, the decision was based on the application of limited public forum principles. When the government provides funds to an entity, and the funding's purpose was to encourage diversity of private views, it must act in a viewpoint-neutral way. Programs funded in this manner are treated as a public forum in which the ability of the government to restrict speech is highly limited. The implications of those subsequent rulings mandated two new rules, one narrow and one broad. Firstly, restrictions may be imposed on LSC as long as they do not discriminate on the basis of \\"viewpoint\\" or \\"opinion.\\" Because the other restrictions were not based on viewpoint, they were upheld. Secondly, on a broader scale the government may not discriminate against viewpoints in any instance that it is funding a private entity to that a diversity of views. For this reason, the decision in Velazquez set an important binding precedent for how the government may act as subsidizer and speaker. Analysis and commentary A Journal of Law and Politics article by Jay Johnson was critical of the decision and the Court's claimed distinction between the speech restriction in Rust and the one on LSC and contended that there was no functional difference between the two. The article highlighted a problem with the Court's interpretation of the statute's purpose at hand: \\"Even assuming the propriety of invoking legislative purpose in statutory interpretation, the text of the [Act] does not support the Court's understanding of the Act's purpose.\\" The article noted that although the Court looked at a section of the Act discussing attorneys \\"protecting the best interest of their clients,\\" the same section noted that the program must be free of \\"political pressures.\\" Because a factor in the Court's reasoning was its understanding of the Act's purpose, that alleged error purportedly misguided the rest of the Court's analysis. Further criticism from the article was that the Court unduly rested its decision on a separation of powers determination. The Court held in Velazquez that the restriction on welfare advocacy cases disrupted the \\"vital relationship between the bar and the judiciary.\\"531 U.S. 535 at 545-546 That finding, the article argued, was baseless because there is no connection between preventing some government lawyers from arguing a single point and the deprivation of due process rights. It concluded that the fundamental problems of statutory interpretation and a lack of a credible distinction with Rust in Justice Kennedy's analysis renders the opinion \\"unconvincing.\\" An article in the Maryland Law Review by Christopher Gozdor, a lawyer in the Maryland Attorney General's office, was also critical of the decision, but he was concerned with an alleged lack of clarity in the majority opinion. It discussed the case law relating to government speech and examined what it described as the \\"conditions doctrine\\" by which certain conditions on receiving federal funds were upheld or struck down. The article then turned to the Rust distinction. Gozdor explained: \\"The Court distinguished Velazquez from Rust because Rust involved a subsidy to facilitate private expression of the government's message, while Velazquez involved LSC funding that was designed [for] private speech.\\"531 U.S. 535 at 541‚Äì542. The critical question for the court was the characterization of the speech that the law promoted. Because advocacy by LSC grantees to change welfare laws was not in advance of the government's own message, the restriction placed on it essentially prohibited a form of private speech. The relationship that the Court set forth, Gozdor asserted, was that the restriction \\"distorted\\" private speech. That \\"distortion principle\\" was the main criticism of the article, as was Scalia's dissenting opinion. Gozdor, agreeing with Scalia's dissent, wrote that the restriction did not create such a distortion of private speech because Congress had still permitted LSC to form affiliate organizations, which would be considered \\"legally separate.\\" Notwithstanding the difficulty of an organization to classify itself as an \\"affiliate entity\\" of LSC, Gozdor argued that there was no real prevention of speech when there were ample alternative means of relaying the message. Further, in attacking the distortion principle's application, Gozdor also argued against the principle as a legal concept in the first place: \\"Regardless of the Court's rationale for its distortion principle, determining a First Amendment violation by measuring whether the government used a subsidy 'in ways which distorted the medium's usual functioning' suggests that forum functions become unchangeable once created.\\" He claimed the unworkability of the distortion principle in a hypothetical example, which would moot the very existence of the LSC: \\"Taking the Velazquez rationale to its logical ends, the LSC subsidy itself could become an unconstitutional speech restriction. If Congress substantially increased LSC appropriations in order to allow LSC to take all of its cases... the functioning of the legal system would be distorted because such a subsidy likely would result in a dramatic increase in the federal courts' caseloads.\\" With that in mind, he concluded with a process by which the Court should have decided the case: a process leading to the upholding of the restriction by finding that LSC's purpose was in promoting the government's message in contrast to a diversity of private views. An article by Jessica Sharpe in the North Carolina Law Review argued that Kennedy's majority opinion wrongly set forth the understanding of the role of an attorney. Sharpe criticized the Court's thesis that the role of the attorney is that of an advocate such that a restriction on the attorney served as a direct restriction of advocacy. That rationale, Sharpe argued, could undermine the balance of abortion restrictions because state regulations on abortion access also could be seen as an intrusion into doctor‚Äìpatient speech. Because Velazquez \\"blurred\\" this distinction, the privileged nature of doctor‚Äìpatient conversations could be subjected to future regulations and limitations.

Life  Stiven is first recorded in a genealogical account of the Johnsons of Hilton. He is said to have lived during the reign of King David II, meaning that he was alive between 1331 and 1368. Johnston lived in Aberdeenshire, Scotland during this time. He is said to have been the brother of the laird of Johnston considering that he shared the same surname and was later able to procure a position of power in Aberdeenshire. Throughout his life he was known as the \\"clerk\\" due to his love of knowledge and research. His knowledge earned him a secretary position to the Earl of Mar during this period of time.  Marriage  Stiven de Johnston married to Margaret, the heiress of the Garioch. Through his marriage he obtained a variety of land including Caskieben, Crimond, and Kinburn. He renamed the lands that he obtained as Johnston. This started the Johnston aristocracy in Aberdeenshire. Their marriage produced multiple offspring including John de Johnston who later went on to rule the family as a patriarch following the death of Stiven de Johnston.  Legacy  Stiven de Johnston is considered to have started the Johnstons of Hilton clan in eastern and northern Scotland, although there is still some debate as the Johnstons of Hilton name at Hutton Hall was not formally adopted until the 17th century. Considering that Stiven de Johnston was the first recorded property owner in Aberdeenshire with a last name of Johnston along with the substantial amount of land that he owned began the creation of multiple Johnston Scottish clans which later spread throughout Scotland.

The family included several Jewish scholars and physicians for the royal family. Family =Abraham Vaez= Abraham Vaez was a hakham of the Portuguese congregation in Bayonne during the latter half of the seventeenth century. He was the author of a work on Jewish ritual laws entitled Arbol de Vidas, to which was appended a lengthy treatise on rituals by Abraham Rodriguez Faro (Amsterdam, 1692). He also wrote several sermons on the Pentateuch, and a number of ethical treatises, which were collected under the title Discursos Predicables y Avisos Espirituales and published, at the expense of his son Jacob Vaez, by Isaac Aboab (Amsterdam, 1710), who himself wrote a long introduction. =Ayres Vaez= Avres Vaez was a physician to John III of Portugal. He died in Rome about the middle of the sixteenth century. At the request of the King of Fez, with whom John, however, was not on terms of amity, Vaez was sent to Africa, where he succeeded in curing the monarch of a dangerous illness. Upon his return to Lisbon, Vaez devoted himself to the study of astronomy and astrology. In consequence of predicting to the king and queen the death of one of their children, a prediction which was fulfilled, he lost the royal favor. Thinking to regain the king's confidence, Vaez declared, in the course of a discussion, that astrology was an unreliable mode of divination, and that its practise was foolish and irreligious. The king, who had recently read a treatise expressing similar views, delivered Vaez to the Inquisition, charging him with being a heretic and a secret Jew. Vaez was ordered to defend himself before the inquisitors, and later to engage in a disputation with the theologian Sorao; but Capodiferro, the papal nuncio, succeeded in removing him from the jurisdiction of the Inquisition, and sent him to Rome to be tried by the Curia. Pope Paul III, who was himself a believer in astrology, not only set Vaez at liberty, but even issued a bull (June 6, 1541) protecting the entire Vaez family, as well as the lawyers who had defended Ayres Vaez, against the Inquisition. =Daniel Vaez= Daniel Vaez was a Portuguese scholar who flourished at Amsterdam in the seventeenth century. Together with Joseph Athias, he published a prayer-book entitled Orden de las Oraciones del Todo el Anno (Amsterdam, 1677). =Immanuel Vaez= Immanuel Vaez was a physician and the eldest of the Vaez brothers. According to the account of Rodrigo de Castro (De Universa Mulierum Morborum Medicina, ii. 47, 332, Hamburg, 1603), who was his nephew, and who settled in Hamburg in the sixteenth century, Immanuel was appointed physician to four kings of Portugal‚ÄîJohn III., Sebastian, Henry, and Philip II. He won this distinction by virtue of his erudition and the experience which he had gathered in his extensive travels. =Pedro Vaez= Pedro Vaez was a physician at Covilh√£, Portugal; second in age of the Vaez brothers. He is repeatedly mentioned in the Medicorum Principum Historia of Abraham Zacuto. =Salvador Vaez= Salvador Vaez was the youngest of the Vaez brothers. He served as a page to the papal nuncio Hieronymo Ricenati Capodiferro in Lisbon, and was able to interest the prelate in the case of his brother Ayres, and to induce him to interfere in the latter's behalf. The result was that after the sessions of the Inquisition had begun, Salvador suddenly entered the hall and declared the sitting dissolved by order of the nuncio. Later he probably accompanied Capodiferro to Rome. =Eleanore Vaez= Eleanore Vaez was a sister to the above. She married Dr David Namias de Castro also known as Andreas Fernandez. Cir 1544.

Origins Burning Log was shot in 1999 by a Shaw Cable staffer named John. It was conceived as a means by which Shaw employees could stay home with their families, instead of working over the holidays. The original film was shot by John at his home near Victoria, British Columbia. The video became famous when university students Rodger Banister, Brian Berglund and Paul McTaggart in Victoria staged a mock protest through a fake not-for-profit called BLOWS (Burning Logs of the West Coast Society) after Shaw took it off the air in 2000. The program was both a critical and ratings success, and by popular demand, it has been rebroadcast ever since. The program is a Canadian counterpart to the older (unrelated) WPIX Yule Log. Ownership controversy Craig McAllister of North Vancouver has claimed that it was he that shot the video, not John. John prefers to maintain anonymity, but his sister in Victoria confirms that the original Shaw video, which led to the mock protest, and a humorous piece on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart & Steve Carell, was indeed shot by her brother in 1999, as a way to allow Shaw staff to have time off over Christmas.

His period as imam covered the period from 1506 to 1555, though his political power ended in about 1547. Construction of a new Zaidi realm Yahya Sharaf ad-Din bin Shams ad-Din bin Ahmad was a grandson of the Imam al-Mahdi Ahmad bin Yahya (d. 1436) and was born in north- western Yemen. He spent several years in study to become a mujtahid (a man of Zaidi religious learning) and then proclaimed his da'wa (call for the imamate) in September 1506. At this time there was another imam in the Yemeni highlands, an-Nasir al-Hasan, who was, however, more a man of letters than a politician. The Tahiride Dynasty ruled the lowlands and southern highlands from Ta'izz, and had recently sacked the Zaidi capital San'a. However, the Tahirids were defeated by the Mamluks from Egypt in 1517 and the Sultan Amir was killed. Shortly afterwards, the Mamluk sultanate in Egypt was in turn defeated by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. The Mamluk troops in Yemen, as a consequence, had to acknowledge the overlordship of Selim. The weak garrison in San'a had to withdraw, and the important city was taken over by al- Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din. The imam proceeded to expand the territory of the Zaidi imamate at the expense of various Tahiride princes who still ruled over scattered domains. Ta'izz was taken in 1534, followed by Khanfar, Lahij and Abyan.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 69. The Imam persecuted the Taiyabi Ismaili community in Yemen. See Mohammad Ezzuddin for further information. Ottoman intervention After three decades of struggles, al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din was able to impose his authority over the most of the Zaidi communities in Yemen, together with several Sunni areas. The imam was assisted by his sons, in particular al- Mutahhar. He thus resurrected the Zaidi imamate after a long period of disunity and much of the southern highlands and northern Tihamah was brought under his control. However, the Ottoman Turks had a vital interest in securing Yemen, which was described as being \\"more flourishing than the province of Egypt\\". At this time the Portuguese seafarers had become a nuisance in the Indian Ocean region, threatening to cut off trade between the Red Sea and the Indian coast. There were therefore good strategical reasons to control south- western Arabia. An Ottoman expedition established a small enclave in Zabid in 1539, but their little enclave was contained by the imam's forces for eight years. However, dissension within the imam's immediate family played into the Turks' hands. His ablest son, al-Mutahhar, even urged the Ottoman commander in Zabid to attack the lands of the imam.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 779. Withdrawing from rulership In 1547, when a new Turkish military onslaught began, al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din had to ask his son al-Mutahhar for support. From that date, Al-Mutahhar took over from his ageing father and struck coins in his own name. The Turkish advance could not be stopped, however. Udzimir Pasha took San'a through treachery in the same year and 1,200 inhabitants were massacred whom were mostly sadah or lords people who claimed there from Hashemites .R.B Serjeant & R. Lewcock 1983, p. 70. Al- Mutahhar continued the anti-Ottoman struggle in the highlands. As for al- Mutwakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din, although deprived of power, he retained much influence within the Zaidi community. His attitude to the encroaching Turks was ambivalent. The old imam died in 1555 in Zafir.Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 779. Other sources say that the imam died in 1557/58.

The lighthouse, constructed in 1964, is the third at this site, following a timber frame lighthouse constructed in 1875 and a concrete lighthouse constructed around 1937.. and report construction in 1936, but plans from the National Archives of Australia clearly show 1937 as the date. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 August 2001. History =First lighthouse= The separation of the colony of Queensland from New South Wale took place with the signing of Letters Patent by Queen Victoria in 1859. The need for pilot assistance accessing the mouth of Fitzroy River and the Port of Rockhampton necessitates the construction of a pilot station on Curtis Island. The first permanent station was established on Cape Capricorn as early as 1861. Though it was moved to Grassy Hill three years later, the need for a lighthouse at Cape Capricorn remained a priority. 1874 plans for the first lighthouse Plans for a lighthouse and cottages were prepared in early 1874 by the office of F. D. G. Stanley, Queensland Colonial Architect, with an estimated cost of for the lighthouse and cottages. The lighthouse, a typical Queensland timber-framed and iron clad structure, was to be prefabricated and built in Brisbane. However, the only response to the first tender was an overpriced offer of . The second tender was more successful, the winning offer being by James Midson for . The construction was completed sometime in October 1874, and an additional contract was granted to Midson for the erection of the structures on the site for the sum of . Quite remarkably, a last minute change in the order of the lantern from England meant that no lamp room was ordered. An urgent request for an additional was made by Stanley for construction of a lamp room from timber framing with iron plating, instead of the planned cast iron one. The lighthouse was operational around late July 1875. The original light source was an oil wick burner. An 1895 survey also reports two additional auxiliary lights on Cape Capricorn, to the north and southeast of the main lighthouse. Supplying the station was done from Rockhampton, and was quite a difficult task. Supplies were brought to the base of the hill by steamboat and then manually winched up over on a tramway. An assessment made by Commander Brewis in 1912 recommended increasing the power of the light, adjusting the eastern auxiliary light, renovating the dwellings, repairing the tramway and supplying steam winches. However, this recommendation was to be followed very slowly and partially. However, in July 1915 the lighthouse was transferred to the control of the federal government, and it took eight more years until in 1923 the light source was finally replaced with a incandescent vapourised kerosene mantle. In January 1936 plans were prepared for electrification of the light. However, it is not clear if this change was made, as in the same year it was decided to replace the tower. =Second lighthouse= Plans for the second lighthouse, 1937 In 1936 the Commonwealth government decided to replace the tower with a new concrete block lighthouse, and plans were prepared in September 1937. The new tower was a square structure, with an adjoined powerhouse. The tower was topped by a cantilevered circular balcony and a small circular lantern. At the same time the residences and service buildings were also replaced with timber-framed asbestos clad structures. The new lighthouse was made operative with electric power in 1938. However, from undetermined reasons this lighthouse was to be short-lived, surviving only 26 years more to be replaced by a new structure in 1964. =Third lighthouse= Cape Capricon Light from the sea, 2007 Plans for a new powerhouse and lighthouse were made in January 1962 and July 1963 respectively. By 1964 construction was complete and the new light was operational. It was the first of a group of seven concrete towers erected between 1964 and 1979, followed by New Caloundra Light, Point Danger Light, New Burnett Heads Light, Fitzroy Island Light, Point Cartwright Light and Archer Point Light. In 1968 the light source was converted to 240 V AC operation. Since its construction and until 1978, Cape Capricorn lightstation served as the base radio station for a network of lighthouses in the area including North Reef Light, Lady Elliot Island Light, Pine Islet Light and Dent Island Light. On 18 December 1978 this role was transferred to Bustard Head Light. On 8 December 1983, the House Standing Committee on Expenditure tabled its report on the inquiry into lightstations entitled \\"Lighthouses: Do we keep the keepers?\\". The report recommended the demanning of 24 lightstation, including Cape Capricorn. In 1988 the station was finally converted to solar power (and presumably demanned). The lantern has been removed, and a self-contained beacon was installed. Ownership of the station was transferred to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in 1991, back to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in 1995 and then to the Queensland Government in July 1997, which employs a caretaker at one of the residences. The rest are privately leased. Current display The light characteristic shown is one flash every five seconds, white/red depending on sector (Fl.W.R. 5s). White is shown 005¬∞-307¬∞, visible for . Red is shown 307¬∞-005¬∞, visible for .List of Lights. The light source is a 120 Volt tungsten-halogen lamp, fed from diesel alternators. Structures The current tower is high, constructed of concrete blocks in a square plan with chamfered corners, with a small porch at the base. A round gallery surrounded with a metal rail overhangs the tower. A self-contained beacon is installed on top of the gallery. The keeper's residence includes two cottages, timber-framed, clad with asbestos cement sheets and timber battens, painted white. The gabled roofs are clad with corrugated iron, painted green. Other similarly constructed structures at the premises include a store, the old powerhouse and a winch house, all mounted on high concrete foundations. The new powerhouse, constructed in 1964, is constructed of concrete blocks, painted white. It includes a large main room and an adjoined porch, both with projecting flat concrete roofs. There are also other sheds of small to medium size on the site, mostly timber-framed with corrugated iron walls and roof. Also notable is the still functional rail line, a cement pathway with steel rails going down to the beach. It includes a trolley of timber on a metal base, a metal rope, a winch and a motor. There is also a cement helipad close-by. There are also some remains in the area. These include two nonoperational auxiliary leading lights, the western light timber- framed clad with fibro and the eastern one made of concrete. The remains of the previous lighthouses are in a gully north of the station The lighthouse and the cottages Site operation and visiting Lenses on display at Townsville Maritime Museum, Cape Capricorn's original lens on the top right The light is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The site manager is the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, as part of the Curtis Island National Park. The island is accessible only by boat or helicopter. The tower is closed to the public, but accommodations are available at the site, including two homesteads and two cabins. The original lens used is currently on display at the Townsville Maritime Museum.

Brief history The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League operated between 1943 and 1954 and started with four teams: the Racine Belles and the Kenosha Comets, both from Wisconsin; the Rockford Peaches from Illinois, and the South Bend Blue Sox from Indiana. Originally, the game was a combination of baseball and softball. Differences were only in the distances between the bases, the distance from the pitching mound to home plate, the size of the ball, and pitching styles through the 12 years of existence of the circuit. It was a neglected chapter of sports history at least until the early 1980s, when a group of former AAGPBL members led by June Peppas organized a retired players association and lobbied to have the circuit recognized in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York. After that, filmmaker Penny Marshall premiered her 1992 film A League of Their Own, a fictional history centered in the first season of the AAGPBL. Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, Lori Petty and Rosie O'Donnell, this film brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League ‚Äì Rules of Play.

She grew up in an orthodox Jewish home playing softball and was already participating in the semi-professional level by age 14, starting with the Katzenjammer Kids, named so for their manager George Katzman obviously inspired by the popular comic strip of same name.Jewish Women Encyclopedia ‚Äì Thelma Eisen entry by David Spaner She attended Belmont High School and graduated from high school in 1941, and attended Santa Monica College part time. Eisen then went out to work to become one of the first Harvey Girls. An outstanding all-around athlete, at 18 she played in a short-lived professional football league for women in California as a fullback, but when Los Angeles city council banned tackle football for women, the team she played moved to Guadalajara, Jalisco. She later applied for work at the Bank of America in Los Angeles, which sponsored a softball team where she played. By then, she was noted by Bill Allington, a former ballplayer and advanced scout for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. By 1944 the AAGPBL added two teams, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes. Eisen attended a tryout arranged by Allington, who would join the circuit for the upcoming season as manager of the Rockford team. She was one of six girls from Los Angeles who traveled to Peru, Indiana for the tryout. The girls passed the test and were rewarded with a contract to play in the league. Eisen joined the Chicks, along with Alma Ziegler, while Faye Dancer, Annabelle Lee, Lavonne Paire and Dorothy Wiltse were allocated to the Millerettes.1944 Minneapolis Millerettes. Retrieved 2019-03-31. AAGPBL career In 1944 Eisen played outfield for the new team based in Milwaukee. The Chicks, managed by Max Carey, included in their roster remarkable players as Josephine Kabick, Merle Keagle and Connie Wisniewski, among others. Eisen batted a modest .204 average in 107 games, driving in 41 runs while scoring 55 times, but stole 91 bases and provided stellar defense at outfield. The Chicks had the best overall record (70-45), after leading the league in runs scored (492), batting average (.207), stolen bases (739), and tying for first in home runs (12). The best offensive support came from Keagle, who hit .264 with 47 runs batted in, while topping the AAGPBL hitters in home runs (7) and total bases (145). The one-two pitching staff was led by Kabick, who posted a 26-19 record for a .578 winning percentage and led all pitchers in wins and innings pitched (366), while Wisniewski went 23-10 (.697) with a 2.23 earned run average. The Chicks then went on to win the Championship Title, beating the Kenosha Comets in the postseason. During the seven-game series Wisniewski went 4-1 with a 0.40 ERA in five complete games, including two shutouts, two one- run games and one two-run game, winning three of four matchups with Kenosha's Helen Nicol, who finished with a 17-11 mark (.607) and had led the league with a minuscule 0.93 ERA. Eisen hit .250 in the Series, including the only home run for her team.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League - Connie Wisniewski biography by Joyce M. Smith. Retrieved 2019-03-31.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Although the Chicks won the championship, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. In fact, the Chicks were forced to play all seven games of the series at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium because the Brewers were using the Borchert Field in Milwaukee. In addition, the high ticket prices charged for AAGPBL games failed to encourage significant fan support. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the team moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season, and became the Grand Rapids Chicks.title= The Forgotten Champs: The 1944 Milwaukee Chicks ‚Äì University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Oral History Project - Interview with Alma Ziegler by Kathleen E.

Grand Rapids, managed by Benny Meyer, finished in third place with a 60-50 and advanced to the playoffs, but lost to Rockford in the first round, three to one games.

By 1946 Eisen joined the expansion Peoria Redwings, stealing 128 bases for them while tying for the most triples (9) along with Racine's Eleanor Dapkus and Rockford's Rose Gacioch. She ranked ninth in average (.256), tenth in total bases (120), and finished second in stolen bases behind Racine's Sophie Kurys, who set a league single-season record with 201 steals in 203 attempts. Eisen garnered All-Star status in the process as the third oufielder behind South Bend's Elizabeth Mahon and Grand Rapids' Merle Keagle. In addition, she piloted the Redwings briefly to become the first female manager in AAGPBL history. In 1947, AAGPBL teams flew from Miami, Florida to Havana, Cuba for spring training. All the teams stayed at the Seville Biltmore Hotel and were filmed for Fox Movietone News going down the steps at the University of Havana. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. By then, city ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano than did the Dodgers. Eisen spent part of the year with Peoria, being dealt to Fort Wayne during the midseason in the same transaction that brought Faye Dancer to the Redwings. Eisen hit a combined .216 with 49 runs and 26 RBI in 111 games for both teams.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League ‚Äì Photo Gallery Eisen would spend the rest of her career with Fort Wayne.

A well- known instance of a polar concept argument is Gilbert Ryle's argument against scepticism (1960). According to Anthony Grayling's characterisation, Ryle's argument can be stated as follows: :There cannot be counterfeit coins, (...) unless there are genuine ones, nor crooked paths unless there are straight paths, nor tall men unless there are short men. According to Ryle's polar concept argument, counterfeit and genuine coins come in pairs, and one cannot conceive of counterfeit coins without also capturing the essence of the genuine coins at the same time. When one grasps the essence of one polar concept, one also grasps immediately the essence of its polar opposite. Ryle's original argument (1960) runs as follows: :A country which had no coinage would offer no scope to counterfeiters. There would be nothing for them to manufacture or pass counterfeits of. They could, if they wished, manufacture and give away decorated disks of brass or lead, which the public might be pleased to get. But these would not be false coins. There can be false coins only where there are coins made of the proper materials by the proper authorities. In a country where there is a coinage, false coins can be manufactured and passed; and the counterfeiting might be so efficient that an ordinary citizen, unable to tell which were false and which were genuine coins, might become suspicious of the genuineness of any particular coin that he received. A polar concept argument bears on some more or less strong version of dialectical monism, a philosophical doctrine that views reality as a unified whole, due to the complementarity of polar concepts.

Life Ashton was a younger son of one of the Lancashire families of Ashton. He attracted the notice of Lady Margaret Beaufort, countess of Derby, who made him comptroller of her household. He commenced M.A. at Oxford 13 October 1507, but soon after had a grace from Cambridge to enter the canon law. He subsequently became canon and prebendary in St. Stephen's, Westminster, 1509; prebendary of Strensall, in the church of York, 1515; Archdeacon of Winchester, 1511 (resigned in 1519); archdeacon of Cornwall, 1515; and Archdeacon of York, 1516. Before 1511 he was rector of Grasmere, Ambleside, and he was also rector of Barnake, Lichfield. In 1522 he was instituted rector of Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire. He had been one of the executors of the will of his early patroness, and like her was interested in the fortunes of St. John's College, Cambridge. Baker says: 'The last chapel was Mr. Hugh Ashton's well known by his monument and his rebus upon it, a thing then much in fashion, and must be forgiven to the humour of the age. It has long since lost the face of religion. Many years after its desecration, in Dr. Beal's time, it was restored to sacred use; but the times coming on when little regard was had to sacred things, and less to sacred places, it was again desecrated, and has not since been restored to such uses as the other two chapels yet standing have been. It may, 'tis hoped, one day recover the right; and might I choose my place of sepulture I would lay my body there, that as I owe the few comforts I enjoy to Mr. Ashton's bounty, so I might not be separated from him in my death.' This is an allusion to Ashton's foundations. The building accounts are given by Cooper and Mayor. Whilst at Cambridge he was 'very serviceable' in the business of the college; but having to be away a great deal he made up for his nonresidence by his benefactions. 'What was wanting in that more public capacity he made up and supported in his private station by founding four fellows, who were his chaplains, and as many scholars, together with an annual dirge to be observed for him on the day of his interment.' According to Thomas Baker, who followed the inscription on his tomb at York, and copied in Queen Mary's reign by George Bullock, then master of St. John's, he died 23 November 1522, but C. H. Cooper and J. E. B. Mayor state that his will was dated 7 Dec. 1522, and proved 9 March following. 'Hic situs est,' runs the inscription, 'Hugo Ashton archidiaconus Ebor., qui ad Christian√¶ religionis augmentum socios 2 ex Lancastria totidemque scolares, sociumque et scholarem Eboracensis sociumque et scholarem Dunelmensis di≈ìcesis oriundos, suis impensis pie instituit, atque singulis a se institutis sociis consuetum sociorum stipendium solidis 40 adauxit. Obiit nono cal. Decemb. an. Dui. 1522.' It is impossible to reconcile this date with that of the will. Ashton's Lancashire foundations were made available to candidates from the entire diocese of Chester. There was an inscription in the hospital of St. Leonard's at York recording Ashton's gift of a window. In addition to the prose tribute, some eulogistic verses, occasioned by a portrait of Ashton, were written by Baker, who bequeathed the picture to John Newcome, master of St. John's.

UP-KYCOM was established in 1997, grants the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, and is an academic division of the University of Pikeville. The college is accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) and by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. KYCOM places special emphasis on osteopathic manipulative medicine, community and behavioral medicine, ambulatory care, and rural medicine. The school is one of thirty osteopathic medical schools in the United States. Pikeville Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine trains the second most primary care physicians of any medical school in the United States. History In September 1993, G. Chad Perry III, an attorney in Paintsville, and his wife, Judy Perry, conceived the idea of establishing a medical school in Eastern Kentucky. Their idea gained supporters who also believed a medical school in Paintsville would eliminate the shortage of primary care physicians in the region. In February 1994, the American College of Osteopathic Medicine (ACOM) was established in Paintsville. It was then renamed the Southern College of Osteopathic Medicine (SCOM) in September 1994.History of Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine. Retrieved on 2010-12-27 By August 1995, it became apparent that there was insufficient financial support to construct a school of osteopathic medicine in Paintsville. The executive staff of SCOM decided to merge with Pikeville College to save the available finances. In May 1996, SCOM became known as Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine (PCSOM). PCSOM received accreditation from the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Professional Education on July 11, 1997. The founding convocation of Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine was held on September 11, 1997, shortly after the matriculation of the first class of 60 students. In 2010, construction began on KYCOM new facility, the Coal Building. Construction was completed in 2012, and was officially dedicated on September 15, 2012. In 2011, when Pikeville College became University of Pikeville, PCSOM became the University of Pikeville Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine (KYCOM). In 2013, KYCOM ranked 5th in rural medicine rankings, tying with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Minnesota and was the highest ranked college of osteopathic medicine in the nation. Admission KYCOM looks to accept applicants who represent the mission of the school which is \\"To provide men and women with an osteopathic medical education that emphasizes primary care, encourages research, promotes lifelong scholarly activity, and produces graduates who are committed to serving the health care needs of communities in rural Kentucky and other Appalachian regions.\\" Students who apply must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution, taken the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), completed and passed 8 semester hours in each category of Organic Chemistry, General Chemistry, and Physics, completed and passed 6 semester hours of English Composition studies, and completed and passed 12 semester hours of Biological Sciences. KYCOM also offers programs to introduce prospective students in lower levels of education to the school and its mission. The Osteopathic Medical Scholars Program (OMSP) offers those incoming undergraduate freshmen who are accepted both a bachelor's degree and a degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine by admitting them into KYCOM upon completion of undergraduate course work at the University of Pikeville, should they meet program requirements. KYCOM also offers a program known as the Professional Education Preparation Program (PEPP). The two-week on campus program educates high school students about the medical occupation. Students are introduced to KYCOM faculty and KYCOM students while engaging in lecture subjects at a pace for the program attendees to get a feel for the future of medical school. Curriculum The first two years at KYCOM are vital to help the medical student learn system based courses as well as discipline science based courses. The education process at KYCOM allows for student exposure to increasing levels of courses to ensure mastering of previous and new concepts. These classes include those such as anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, and principles of osteopathic medicine. The classes have exams and lectures along with the COMLEX exams which students must pass to successfully complete their respected years whether first or second. KYCOM students, in year one, begin their practicing of doctoral skills on human models. During year two, students engage in practice under community physicians. Student doctoring skills and competencies are more thoroughly developed in clinical rotations during years three and four. The third and fourth years of the medical school student are mainly spent away from the medical school as students observe and practice under trained and registered physicians and surgeons to develop an understanding of where they might specialize and apply for residency training programs upon completion of their education at KYCOM. Some of the clinical rotations include Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, General Surgery, Emergency Medicine and Clinical Osteopathic Medicine. The rotation cites for students range from counties in Kentucky to other states such as Arkansas, Alabama, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Student statistics and notable faculty For KYCOM's class of 2015, the average MCAT score was 24, the average cumulative GPA was 3.5, and the average science GPA was 3.4. This has increased since 2011 when the average MCAT score was 21.97 and the average cumulative GPA was a 3.3. KYCOM as an institution has had over 700 students graduate with their degrees as Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine since its establishment in 2001. Sixty percent of these physicians have been serving in the Appalachian region. KYCOM is ranked fourth in affordability compared to all other of U.S. private medical schools. Sixty nine percent of the school's graduates have gone on to be primary care physicians, the second highest of any institution in the country. Two thirds of seniors graduating from KYCOM have been admitted to their first choice residency program, while eighty five to ninety percent of graduating seniors have gone on to one of their top three residency programs. Governor Paul E. Patton, the president of the University of Pikeville, is the president of the Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine as well. He is the former 59th governor of the state of Kentucky. Dr. Boyd R. Buser D.O. is the Dean and vice president of health affairs of the Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine. Buser is a former president of the American Academy of Osteopathy, chair of the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, and member of the Kentucky Institute of Medicine, the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, the American Osteopathic Association Board of Trustees and the Board of Directors of the Osteopathic International Alliance.

The hut is named after the co-founder of the Kufstein Section, Anton Karg, who was the manager of the hut from 1888 and, from 1890 to 1919, the chairman of the Kufstein Branch of the Alpine Club.  Location  The Anton Karg Haus lies in the upper region of the Kaisertal valley at a spot where the Kaiserbach stream is known as the Hinterb√§renbad (see below). The house is located in quiet, spectacular surroundings with a view of both the Wilder Kaiser and the Zahmer Kaiser in the middle of the Wilder Kaiser nature reserve. It is easy to reach even for day trippers and so is a popular destination, especially in fine weather. The path to the hut is considered particularly scenic, as the light-coloured limestone rocks of the Kaisergebirge open up increasingly as it progresses, and hiker literally walk into the mountains. Although the Kaisergebirge are not all that high for the Alps, this route is particularly impressive because of the height difference of between the level of the path and the surrounding peaks.  History  The Anton Karg Haus has a long tradition. In 1882 the borough of Kufstein lent the Kufstein Branch an alpine hut which, after remodelling, was opened as the Hinterb√§renbad Hut on 25 July 1883. After a further expansion in 1884 the house, together with a second, newly built wooden building, was transferred to the full ownership of the Kufstein Branch. After the construction of a veranda and the conversion of the second building into sleeping accommodation the Hinterb√§renbad Refuge House was open for guests from 1887. In 1894 this led to its enlargement as well as a partial new build.. In the winter months of 1894/95 the New Hinterb√§renbad Hut was built, which opened in spring 1895.. In: Mittheilungen des Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpenvereins. No. 10/1895, Vol. 21, 1895, p. 120. (Online bei ALO). The unusually spacious rooms, some equipped with balconies, date to this period.. In 19th century and beginning of the 20th century it was a summer retreat for respected townsfolk in Kufstein. The unusually spacious rooms for a mountain hut, some even with a private balcony, date from that period. For many years, the house was hosted by the Pavicic family (the tenants changed in 2006). = Hinterb√§renbad = The Anton Karg Haus lies at a particularly beautiful point on the Kaiserbach stream, the Hinterb√§renbad. According to oral tradition brown bears, formerly widespread in the entire Alpine region, used to cool themselves here on hot summer days by taking a bath. It is also possible that the bears were looking for food and that it just appeared as if they were bathing in the Kaiserbach. In the 19th century the bears were exterminated by Alpine residents out of fear, and especially of their perceived threat to their cattle. There have been attempts, however, to reintroduce bears to the Austrian Alps. Of the former presence of bears, only old drawings and paintings remain.

It started serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka sh≈çjo manga magazine in May 1992. The story takes place at the end of days, in the year 1999. The series follows Kamui Shir≈ç, a young esper who returns home to Tokyo after a six-year absence to face his destiny as the one who will determine humanity's fate. Publishing the series in Japan proved troublesome on account of its disasters it shown which were reminiscent of ones that happened in Japan such as earthquakes or murders committed by juveniles. Serialization stopped in March 2003 and in March 2005 Clamp stated they were searching for a proper magazine to conclude it. The chapters have been collected in a total of eighteen tank≈çbon volumes with the first one released on July 29, 1992 and the eighteenth on September 17, 2002. On September 26, 2006, Kadokawa Shoten published Clamp Newtype Platinum, a special Clamp edition of Newtype. The issue includes the \\"X 18.5\\" supplement, a re-print of five previously uncollected chapters. The series was originally expected to reach twenty-one volumes upon completion. The X manga has also been adapted into various anime, including a feature film, an original video animation and a TV series. The North American version of the manga, retitled X/1999, was serialized in Viz Media's Animerica Extra and released in tank≈çbon form under the Sh≈çjo imprint. In July 2001, Viz Media removed the series from Animerica Extra due to licensing issues, but it later returned in its issue published in March 2003. All the eighteen volumes have been released by Viz Media as of May 10, 2005. By April 2010, manga editor Carl Gustav Horn Carl from Dark Horse Comics stated they would not license the series until it finished in Japan; Viz Media still maintains the licence to the English edition of X.

The pieces, handmade to order in India, are colored with non-toxic vegetable dye. The individual opposite ends of the pieces are marked with pips and numbered similar to regular dice - i.e. they total 7. It takes all 3 pieces of a color to make up a single die. The game was designed by Martin H. Samuel, published in 2006 by Games Above Board and launched at that year's Spiel game fair in Germany. The game is played with a 3√ó3 game board, 3 green and 3 red playing pieces, 1 green, 1 red and 1 neutral color pawn, and a pencil and paper for scoring. A variation, Pocket Mojo, is a travel version played with similar but smaller components. Objective Mojo and Mojo Too are pure strategy variations of the game. The goal of the game is to have three own-color pieces on the board in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. Mojo 2 is played for points using luck and strategy. The goal is to have three own-color pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row and score the most points. Gameplay The Mojo game board has a grid of horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines joining 9 marked playing piece positions. Players choose either green or red and use 3 same- color pieces each. The 3 pawns are placed in the bag and the first player to draw their color from the bag starts. Mojo is played with 3 pieces each and a single neutral pawn, used as a blocker, that is common to and may be moved by both players. The game starts with the pawn in the center of the board and during play, there is a choice of 2 empty spaces. Players take turns placing their 3 pieces on the board, one at a time, on any empty position, building on those already on the board, to complete and/or block winning rows. Then, continue by moving any piece (including the opponent's) or the pawn to an adjacent empty space. Players may move the pawn. Pieces and pawns may not jump over each other and the last piece or pawn moved may not be returned to its previous position. The game is over when a player has 3 same-color pieces in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally and is then the winner of the game. Mojo Too is similar in principle and played with 3 pieces and 1 pawn each. Starting with an empty board, players take turns placing their 3 pieces then 1 pawn, one at a time, on any empty position on the board. Then, continue by moving any piece (including the opponent's) or their pawn to the 1 adjacent empty space - to complete and/or block winning rows. Players may only move their own pawn. Pieces and pawns may not jump over each other and the last piece or pawn moved may not be returned to its previous position. The game is over when a player has 3 same-color pieces in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally and is then the winner. Mojo 2 is similar in principle and played as Mojo and Mojo Too for points. The playing pieces, with numbered opposite ends, are placed on the board either end up and always inverted when moved, thereby constantly changing the score. The game may be played for a certain number of rounds or to an agreed points total. The round is over when a player has 3 same-color pieces in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The pips on the tops of the pieces in a winning row are added up and the first to reach the set score is the winner of the game. In this way, the best of 5 rounds may be 2 - on points.

The locomotives were built by General Electric and Ingersoll Rand without ALCO. Production lasted from 1928 till 1930. These boxcabs were often termed oil-electrics to avoid the use of the German name Diesel, unpopular after World War I.  History  In 1912 GE combined for the first time an internal combustion engine with electric traction motors. Impetus for wider adoption of this technology was provided by improved control systems introduced around 1920 and the State of New York's Kaufman Act, which banned the use of steam locomotives within the New York metropolitan area. A consortium consisting of ALCO, GE and Ingersoll Rand started series production of the ALCO-Boxcabs in 1925. ALCO dropped out of the arrangement in 1928, after acquiring their own diesel engine manufacturer in McIntosh & Seymour and went on to start its own line of diesel switchers. GE and Ingersoll Rand went on with the production of the former ALCO boxcabs, but without ALCO. The locomotives were built in the GE plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, except the unit for Canadian National Railway (CN), which was built by the railroad itself in their workshop. In total 17 were built.  Models  CNW #1200 800 hp locomotive for Erie Railroad All models have chassis and running gear, generator, traction motors and controls from GE, and Ingersoll Rand provided the diesel engine. The principle of operation was the same as modern locomotives, the diesel engine driving a main generator of 600 volts DC with four axle-hung traction motors. In contrast to the ALCO boxcabs having a design with side doors and ladders the GE boxcabs have front doors and end platforms with steps. The underframe was cast iron. The radiator system was sitting on the roof of the locomotive. At each locomotive end a GE Model CD65 motor with a Sturtevant multivane fan was pressing air through the radiators. Two models were in series production and two versions were only produced once: * a 60-Ton locomotive with a six-cylinder four-stroke in-line engine of 300 hp * a 100-Ton locomotive with two of the same engines as the 60-Ton model * a 120-Ton locomotive with a single six-cylinder 800 hp unit (1 prototype built for Erie Railroad) * a 120-Ton locomotive with two of the same engines as the 60-Ton model (1 unit built for CN)  Surviving examples  Foley Brothers 110-1 sitting on the siding in Portola, CA across from the Western Pacific Railroad Museum. The flatcar has an extra set of flangless wheels on each of its trucks to handle this heavy locomotive. Foley Brothers 110-1 working in the coal mine in Colstrip, Montana. The only surviving GE boxcab is the 100-ton unit built in December 1929 and delivered to the contractor Foley Brothers in January 1930. It was used with the road number 110-1 for pulling coal trains in a Northern Pacific Railway owned mine in Coalstrip, Montana till it was withdrawn somewhere in the 1960s and later ended up in the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, CA.

She was portrayed by actress Eileen Mayers. The character is famous for her suicide plot which was ultimately axed. Casting Mayers left the series in 1967 and was asked to return for two episodes in 1969, as part of Elsie Tanner's (Pat Phoenix). In 1974, the actress returned to filming for another stint as Sheila. Storylines Through his many faults, Sheila fell hard for Neil Crossley (Geoffrey Matthews), so much so that she did not see how badly he treated her. Neil only thought of Sheila as a bit of fun and after he stood her up on a date, she confronted him. Angered, Neil hit Sheila and left, leaving her devastated and she sank into a deep depression. She pushed her friends away and lost her job for not turning up. After she and Neil met again and he told her in no uncertain terms that they were over, Sheila attempted suicide but was found by Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie). On the doctor's recommendation, Sheila left Weatherfield and moved in with her parents. Whilst there, Sheila discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy in 1964, who she named Danny, before giving him up for adoption. In 1966, Sheila was set up on a blind date by a friend and was shocked to find her date was Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), who she went on an unsuccessful date with years ago. Sheila and Jerry reconnected and Sheila returned to Weatherfield and moved in with Elsie Tanner's (Pat Phoenix), securing a job at the new factory. Sheila and Jerry quickly fell in love and intended to marry but when Sheila bumped into Neil later that year, her feelings for him came rushing back and Neil proposed. Jerry was heartbroken when Sheila left with Neil. Reception After learning that Sheila's character was to commit suicide in 1963, the public was outraged. Instead, it was re-written and viewers saw the character take pills before the screen faded to black. Actress Eileen Mayers has claimed that \\"It was disappointing, it was good and it wasn't shown\\", referring to the suicide scenes. However, in 2011, the scenes were shown in the documentary The Corrie Years. Upon the announcement that the scenes were to air 50 years later, a Coronation Street insider told the Daily Mirror that \\"At the time it was deemed too controversial. But compared to what goes on in soaps these days, I don't think the scene will be very shocking.\\" The character's suicide plot has been compared to that of Natasha Blakeman's in 2010 in the soap.

Built c. 1712 by John Burrows, this 2-1/2 story wood frame structure is one of few early 18th-century buildings still standing in Connecticut, built on land that was among the earliest settled in the area. Now a private residence, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Black Horse Tavern is located near the eastern end of Saybrook Point, a peninsula dividing two coves (North and South Coves) on the west side of the Connecticut River near its mouth at Long Island Sound. The tavern's location is a short distance west of the site of Fort Saybrook, the first element of the Saybrook Colony, built in 1635. The tavern is a 2-1/2 story timber framed structure, with a gabled roof and slightly off-center chimney. Its main facade is four bays wide, with the entrance in the center-left bay; the chimney is positioned behind the entrance. The entrance, which features an original vertical board door, is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round fanlight, and is sheltered by a gabled portico. The interior layout has a large front-to-back chamber to the right of the chimney, and a parlor and kitchen to the left and behind. The tavern was built about 1712 by John Burrows, on land originally deeded to John Clark Sr. in 1644. The North Cove was then coming into use as a shipbuilding center, and the tavern operated by Burrows would have served its workers and travelers moving on the river. North Cove Road was then also the major road following the western shore of the river, another source of passing travelers. The building served as a tavern providing services to passing travelers, under a variety of owners, until 1924, and is now a private residence. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut References Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Houses in Old Saybrook, Connecticut Houses completed in 1712 National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut ","title":"Black Horse Tavern (Old Saybrook, Connecticut)"},{"id":"30226784","text":"Ghaffor Mirzoyev (Tajik: “í–∞—Ñ—Ñ–æ—Ä –ú–∏—Ä–∑–æ–µ–≤) is a Tajik politician who was the former head of the Drug Control Agency in Tajikistan.

On the 26th of December 1996, 750 ZUS were founded by the d√©cret n¬∞96-1156. The 751th ZUS ¬´Nouveau Mons¬ª in Mons-en-Baroeul was founded on the 24th of August 2000 by the d√©cret n¬∞2000- 796. On the 31st of July 2001, the d√©cret n¬∞2001-707 has changed the p√©rimeter of Grigny's ZUS. There are 751 sensitive urban zones in France, including 718 in mainland France. The government has published the list of zones and maps of each one.  Social problems within the zones  Nearly five million people live in zones of difficulty with many problems: * A high percentage of public housing, with little home ownership. * High unemployment. * A low percentage of high-school graduates. Government policy  A law passed November 14, 1996 created sensitive urban zones (ZUS) and urban tax-free zones (ZFU). 752 of these zones were created in France, including 718 in mainland France. The law of November 14, 1996 (which implements a renewed urban policy) distinguishes three levels of intervention: * Sensitive urban zones (', ZUS) * Urban renewal zones (', ZRU) * Urban tax- free zones (', ZFU) The three levels of intervention (ZUS, ZRU and ZFU), characterized by fiscal and social measures of increasing importance, target the difficulties encountered in these districts with differing degrees of response. Contrary to generally accepted ideas, these sensitive districts are in the center of cities and not just the outskirts.\\"La carte des ZUS comment√©e par Christophe Guilluy\\", 20minutes.fr, June 1, 2006 The situation in these areas in difficulty was (until recently) difficult to evaluate precisely, based on many statistics which were inadequate in certain areas, scattered or badly collected. To remedy these problems and more accurately measure the effect of policy implementation, the National Observatory of Sensitive Urban Zones (ZUS) was created in a law passed on August 1, 2003. These ZUS are distributed throughout 490 communes and include 4.7 million inhabitants. Among them a subset of 416 zones of urban renewal (ZRU) was created, including 396 in mainland France. The ZRU contain 3.2 million inhabitants, and present unique challenges. Almost all departments are affected; the only exceptions are nine strongly agricultural departments.  January 2015 controversy  In January 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, several items on Fox News labeled the ZUS as \\"Islamic no-go zones\\".

It was co-written by Gabriella herself alongside George Astasio, Jason Pebworth and Jon Shave. Release \\"Defender\\" was released as a digital download on 26 August 2010. The single failed to appear on the UK Singles Chart. Critical reception Jon O'Brien from Allmusic said that: \\"The epic beats of the Dido- esque power \\"Defender,\\" offer a respite from the party atmosphere, but as competent as they are, Ten is much more interesting when Cilmi unleashes her previously hidden disco diva tendencies\\".O'Brien, Jon (May 23, 2010) Ten- Gabriella Cilmi - Allmusic Review Allmusic Retrieved 2011-02-13 Music video The music video for \\"Defender\\" starts off with Cilmi with her back to the camera holding a microphone, a stage light is shining on her and a crowd can be heard cheering and applauding her. The video then cuts to Gabriella sitting and singing in a room wearing a white top; the room seems to be a part of a derelict space station. Clips of her walking through the corridors with a black dress intersect the parts of the video with her in the room. Whilst walking through the corridor she takes off her jewellery and her dress leaving Cilmi in just her underwear and shoes. Water then sprays over her and close ups of Gabriella with wet hair are shown. Scenes of her in the white top intersect again. Gabriella is seen fully clothed again and she starts to cut her wet hair with a pair of scissors. She then finds some ink in a glass bottle and uses an instrument to tattoo 3 bars on her wrist. She wraps black material around her wrists and is then seen walking down the corridor again only this time she is holding a katana and she has a scarf around her mouth.

It was titled this by Luke Barham, he explains \\"after 10 years of writing together we finally have a full length record to present to the world. We wanted to introduce the band to new fans but also reacquaint with older friends. The title also reminds us of the warm friendly welcome of classic albums like Meet The Beatles and The Beach Boys Love You.\\" The album was released on CD, 180g heavyweight vinyl, download and MiniDisc which was limited to only 20 copies and came as part of a bundle via Alcopop! Records. Say Hi To The band was produced by former Test Icicles member Rory Attwell who achieved recognition through a string of successful productions including The Vaccines, Veronica Falls, Yuck, and Male Bonding.

Originally found in 1839 at the National Library of Brazil, where it is kept to this day, the document describes curious sights, monuments, and artifacts of Graeco-Roman appearance found by the group in the abandoned settlement. The manuscript is one of the most famed documents of the National Library's collection and some Brazilian historians consider it \\"the greatest myth of national archaeology\\",Langer, J. A Cidade Perdida da Bahia: mito e arqueologia no Brasil Imp√©rio, publicado na Revista Brasileira de Hist√≥ria, vol. 22. n¬∫ 43. while others praise its vivid and picturesque writing style. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Manuscript 512 was the object of intense debate and instigated many expeditions by adventurers and investigators, notably Sir Richard F. Burton, who published the work Highlands of Brazil in 1869, and Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, who disappeared in one of his expeditions through inner Brazil, resulting in several attempts to find him.Documento 512 ‚Äì ‚ÄúO mapa de uma Cidade Perdida‚Äù - Biblioteca Nacional do Rio de Janeiro The \\"lost city\\" described in the manuscript inspired several articles, films and novels, such as Jos√© de Alencar's As minas de prata (1865), Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines (1886), and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912). In addition, the character Indiana Jones may have been inspired by the events surrounding Colonel Fawcett. Access to the original document is very restricted, but a digitalized version is currently available online. Discovery The National Library of Brazil In 1839, naturalist Manuel Ferreira Lagos casually found the document, whose full title was Rela√ß√£o hist√≥rica de huma oculta, e grande Povoa√ß√£o, antiguissima sem moradores, que se descubrio no anno de 1753 (\\"Historical relation of an occult, large, very old settlement with no inhabitants that was found in the year 1753\\"), in the library's collection.O MANUSCRITO 512: A CIDADE PERDIDA DA BAHIA - Wagner Ribeiro de Carvalho (FACE - UNEB), 2009. He then presented it to the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and canon Fr. Janu√°rio da Cunha Barbosa later publicized a full copy of the manuscript in the institute's magazine, Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro, with a preface connecting it to the earlier case of Roberio Dias, also known as \\"Muribeca\\", a bandeirante arrested by the Portuguese crown for refusing to give information about mines of precious metals in Bahia, which later propelled numerous expeditions in the province. Although the author of Manuscript 512 was (and still is) not identified, the members of the institute took the account as authentic in the hopes of finding the ruins of an advanced civilization in Brazil, a nation that had recently achieved its independence and sought to build a strong national identity. At the time, ruins of Pre-Columbian civilizations had been recently found in Latin America, such as Palenque in Mexico and fortifications in the Peruvian border, and that could signify that similar monuments were also hidden in Brazil. Accounts about rocks with purportedly Pre-Columbian inscriptions were common since colonial times; one of such examples was the Ing√° Stone found in Para√≠ba in 1598, which contains what appears to be Latin letters. As such, Manuscript 512 strengthened the theory that an ancient Graeco-Roman civilization could have existed at some remote time in Brazil. In 1840, Ignacio Accioli Silva and A. Moncorvo, two scholars from Salvador, Bahia, opined that the account about the lost city could be authentic because, according to explorers and some old inhabitants of the location, large ruins populated by runaway native and black slaves were commonly mentioned in tradition. Historian Pedro Calmon explains that rumors about ruins were already popular after the death of bandeirante Jo√£o Guimar√£es in 1766 and, by the 1840s, were fully consolidated, in addition to being mixed with stories about indigenous refuges or quilombos in inner Bahia. Between 1841 and 1846, searches for the lost city sponsored by the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute were conducted by Fr. Benigno Jos√© de Carvalho through Chapada Diamantina. Despite Carvalho's reported diligence, the expeditions were unsuccessful and the previous enthusiasm about the city's existence was replaced by disillusion and skepticism. A predominant theory at the time was that the vision of the lost city was inspired by the strange rocky formations of Chapada Diamantina; Teodoro Sampaio, who traveled through the region between 1879 and 1880, was convinced that the account of Manuscript 512 was fictional and described the mountain range poetically. The number 512, by which the manuscript is currently known, first appeared in 1881 in the Exposition Catalogue of the History of Brazil by Ramiz Galv√£o. Content Triple Roman arch in Timgad, Algeria. The arch at the lost city's entrance described in the manuscript is similar in appearance to this one. The manuscript itself appears to be a transcription of a lost original work. Although the main body of the document appears to be a personal letter, the preamble given by the transcriber describes it as a historical report. Because some parts of the manuscript's pages are decayed, a portion of the text is missing. The text relates that a Portuguese colonel (whose name is missing) and his party were drawn by curiosity to the site of an impressively tall, glistening mountain range. By happenstance they found a path to summit the range with facility. When they reached the peak, they sighted a settlement that they initially mistook for one of Brazil's coastal cities. Upon approaching it, they found it was actually dilapidated and abandoned. The city's only entrance was ornamented with a triple archway, similar in appearance to Roman triumphal arches, on which there were inscriptions in an unknown language. The city's square had a black pedestal with a statue of a man pointing north and a large building near it was decorated with reliefs and inlaid works depicting crosses, crows (or possibly console-style swirls), and various other designs. The square also featured \\"Roman spires\\" (most likely obelisks) in all four corners. The main street's portico bore a relief carving of a half-naked figure wearing a laurel crown. There was a river next to the square and after following it the group reached a collection of mineshafts where they found silver-infused rocks and more undeciphered inscriptions. Somewhere outside of the city they also found a large countryside manor which contained fifteen separate houses surrounding a great central room (possibly an atrium). The party then tested the soil near the river for gold flecks, which they found in abundance. The author reflects on the curious state of the abandoned city and gives a brief mention of the fauna that inhabit the ruins, apparently describing maned wolves and kangaroo rats. It is anachronistically mentioned that Jo√£o Ant√¥nio (the only member whose name was preserved) found a gold coin in one of the houses they searched, which depicted a boy kneeling down on one side and a bow, arrow, and crown on the other.

Formerly a vocational-technical school, the state legislature designated the school as a college in 1991 with the name Pines Technical College. It acquired its current name in 1998.- U.S. Colleges and Universities History Southeast Arkansas College was originally named Arkansas Vocational-Technical School. It began offering postsecondary vocational-technical programs on September 21, 1959. Act 328 of 1957 set the stage for it to become the first vocational-technical school in Arkansas to meet the needs of industry and to provide jobs, and raise the standard of living, for Arkansas citizens. The school's first director was Leon Coker, who headed it from 1958 to 1974. The school's name was later changed to Pines Vocational-Technical School. When Act 1244 of the Seventy-eighth Arkansas General Assembly, was signed into law by Governor Bill Clinton on April 17, 1991, it re-designated and redefined the mission of eleven existing postsecondary vocational-technical schools located throughout the state to technical colleges. Consequently, state authority for these institutions was transferred from the Arkansas Board of Vocational-Technical Education to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education, which serves as the state coordinating agency for all public universities, community colleges, and technical colleges in Arkansas. With the enactment of Act 1244 on July 1, 1991, all land, buildings, equipment, and personnel associated with Pines Vocational-Technical School were transferred to Pines Technical College. In October 1991, the governor appointed the charter members of the Pines Technical College Board of Trustees. The college's first president, Dr. Terry J. Puckett (1992‚Äì2000), was appointed by the board effective December 1, 1992. To better reflect the college's service area, it changed its name from Pines Technical College to Southeast Arkansas Technical College on July 1, 1996. The word ‚ÄúTechnical‚Äù was removed from the college's name on July 8, 1998. On Nov. 30 2017, the SEARK Board of Trustees announced Steven Bloomberg as the college's new president. Academics Educational programs and services at SEARK College include technical career education, workforce development, university transfer education, general education, adult education, continuing education, and community services.

The Austrian cavalrymen made an overwhelming charge against the French and severely defeated them.  Background  In August 1793 the French Army of the North under Jean Nicolas Houchard faced the Imperial army of The Prince of Coburg. Houchard's attention was focused on drawing his forces to his left flank to relieve Dunkirk resulting in the Battle of Hondschoote. Activities on the right (southern) theatre of the war in Flanders centred on the Siege of Le Quesnoy. Coburg had cleared the forest of Mormal in August, forcing the French defenders back to Landrecies and Bouchain, and began the siege of the town with the forces of Clerfaye. Houchard gave orders for a relief attempt from two columns.  Battle  On the evening of 11 September two columns prepared to march against the besieging forces. Jean Alexander Ihler left Maubeuge with 14,000 men, marching through Landrecies and Avesnes where he collected more men, and attacked the covering forces. He was beaten back, his command retreating \\"in the greatest disorder\\".Phipps I p.243 The second column under General Nicolas Declaye initially consisted of the garrison of Cambrai (2,500 infantry, 240 cavalry and 120 gunners), largely untested raw recruits. These left the town at 1.00am on 12 September to the sound of the bells celebrating news of Houchard's victories. They were joined at Bouchain by some 1,300 men from the garrison, giving Declaye 4,663 men and leaving both towns now largely undefended.The figure of 4,663 men is taken from Phipps Vol I p.243 The idealistic levees of this column carried with them two guillotines, but, in the words of Ramsay Phipps, \\"these heroes soon found the difference between beheading defenceless fellow countrymen and meeting in the field the men they loved to describe as 'the slaves of the tyrants'\\" Phipps I p.243 Declaye marched the column through Avesnes-le-Sec, then turned left towards the Austrian camp at Solesmes. Hohenlohe commanded 2,000 cavalrymen, which appeared to the left of Villers. Declaye attempted to fall back towards Avesnes-le-Sec, but the Austrian squadrons charged and quickly dispersed the Republican cavalry, which abandoned the field for Bouchain, followed closely by Declaye himself. His infantry formed square just outside Avesnes to receive the enemy cavalry, but these untrained men were completely ridden over by Lichtenstein and mercilessly sabred, the Austrians (including the French √©migr√© Royal-Allemand regiment) inflicting losses of 2,000 killed and wounded while losing only 69 men. In addition, 2,000 soldiers and 18 artillery pieces were captured.Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998.Phipps I p.243 Aftermath Had Coburg followed up this victory he would have found Cambrai and Bouchain stripped of men to fill out Declaye's column and completely open, however the Austrians turned their attentions towards besieging Maubeuge. Declaye was arrested for his conduct, however managed to avoid punishment due to his strong republicanism and political connections.  References  Further reading *.

The Court upheld the provision because the companies were still able to pursue a claim in state court. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the unanimous Opinion of the Court, reversing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which had ruled the contested labor code regulation unconstitutional.

Before defending his doctoral thesis, Savenko was expelled from the Institute of Psychiatry in 1974. His main works concern anxious psychotic syndromes, psychotic disorders problems, subject of psychiatry, and the classification of mental disorders. Yuri Savenko took part in a 'wrongful confinement' lawsuit filed in the European Court of Human Rights in 2003. When writing about this case, Savenko charged the Serbsky Institute with having a \\"pernicious effect on Russian medicine\\" and warned that the leadership of the psychiatric community \\"is now completely under the shadow of the state.\\" On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the State Duma a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address a sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to a lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. In 2009, Yuri Savenko and Valery Krasnov provided the leadership for the Second East European Congress of Psychiatry in Moscow.  Eugenic views  Savenko is a supporter of preventive eugenics, he justifies enforced sterilization of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes, and states that However, Article 7 of Part 1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines enforced sterilization among crimes against humanity. In 2013, he seemed to take the opposite point of view and criticize German eugenics in the documentary Archetype. Neurosis. Libido. T-4 Death Squad produced by the Rossiya K TV channel.He says, \\"All statistics show Germany has the same rate of serious mental illness as that throughout the whole world. They reached nothing and only disgraced themselves\\". Watch from 23:09  Attitude to homosexuality  In 2005, Savenko as the president of the IPA expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. His statement was put in the following words: \\"It is surprising for us that the substitution of ideological, social and liberal reasoning for scientific one came not from Russia and that the Executive Committee of the APA unanimously proposed to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry. It shows that even the well-developed legal framework for psychiatry and the denationalization of mental health service (by 80% in the USA), ie, the absence of two of the three factors that played a crucial role in Soviet abuses of psychiatry, does not protect against inherently antipsychiatric actions\\". In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he and Perekhov in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality that has endured into the present day.  The resolution on Savenko  On 19 December 2013, the Commission on Professional Ethics Issues at the Board of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists delivered to Savenko when he raised ethical issues concerning the case of Mikhail Kosenko in publications, a resolution as follows: Savenko responded that the strikingly unethical nature of the resolution by the Ethical Commission (of 12 December 2013) showed in the ascription to the IPA open letter to the WPA, hosted on the website, of phrases that were never used there. He adds we see a rather awkward performance of a social role using the old scenario of accusatory campaigns of Soviet times to have the possibility to refer to \\"the opinion of the professional public\\" for use abroad.

The following is a list of characters that first appeared in 1967, by order of first appearance. Steve Tanner Stephen Edward \\"Steve\\" Tanner, played by Paul Maxwell, was an old flame of Elsie Tanner's from the war. He returned to Weatherfield in 1967 and rekindled his relationship with Elsie. They married that year and moved back to Steve's hometown in America. In 1968 Elsie returned alone saying her marriage was over. Steve followed Elsie back to the Street but he was pushed down a flight of stairs and killed by Joe Donnelli. Ernest Bishop Ernest Gordon Bishop, played by Stephen Hancock, made his first screen appearance on 6 September 1967. Ernest had been educated at Weatherfield Grammar School, and, despite being very academically inclined, he refused a place at Manchester Victoria University, in order to run his own photographic business. Operating under his \\"professional\\" name Gordon Bishop, he first appeared at Elsie Tanner's wedding as official photographer in 1967. In 1969, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) began working at Ernest's camera shop. Emily and Ernest had many things in common, not least firm religious beliefs (Ernest was a lay preacher), and they began a relationship. After a long courtship, they married on Easter Monday 1972 and moved into No. 3 Coronation Street together. The Bishops were unable to have children of their own but fostered two children at Christmas 1974, which helped mend a rough patch in their marriage. In 1976, Ernest was unable to afford the rent on his camera shop and put his business into liquidation. Emily, however, was a tower of strength, insisting that she go out to work and be the bread winner. Ernest became the Street's first househusband; making him the butt of jokes from the other men on the Street, but Emily was proud of him. Ernest was able to make some spare money by playing the piano in pubs and night clubs ‚Äîhe was accompanist for Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) at the Gatsby Club‚Äîbut, despite being grateful for the money, Emily drew the line when Ernie played the piano for a stripper, who came round to their house to practice her act. Ernest's fortunes changed when factory owner Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) offered him a job as wages clerk at Baldwin's Casuals. Mike's trust in Ernest effectively made him a second-in-command. One day in January 1978, when drawing up the workers' wage packets, two young men, one, Tommo, armed with a shotgun, burst into the office and demanded Ernest hand over the money. Ernest obliged, but Mike entered the office and accidentally knocked Tommo's arm, discharging the gun and shooting Ernest in the chest. He was rushed to hospital but later died. The shock of hearing what had happened made Emily faint in the Street. The two criminals were later apprehended and sentenced to life imprisonment. 28 years later, in 2006, Emily became friends with churchgoer Ed Jackson (Chris Walker). They became friends and bonded over their strong religious faith until Ed revealed his real name to be Thomas Jackson, the man who killed Ernest. Jackson claimed he had served his sentence and become a born-again Christian and wanted forgiveness from Emily for Ernest's murder. This caused Emily to have a crisis of faith as she couldn't bring herself to forgive him. However, upon learning Jackson was suicidal, she told him she forgave him and gave him one of Ernest's old cameras. Robert Croft Robert Croft, played by Martin Shaw, made his first screen appearance on 13 December 1967. The role as \\"hippy student\\" Robert marked Shaw's television debut. Robert was the leader of a hippie commune. When Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) develops a crush on Robert, she decides to join the hippies. Lucille asks Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to throw a New Year's party at 11 Coronation Street and Robert and the hippies come along. They stay and begin squatting in the house, causing a ruckus among the Street's other residents. Eventually Annie Walker (Doris Speed) reports the hippies to the landlord, who demands their removal and Robert decides that it is time for them to leave.

These boxcabs were termed oil battery electrics to avoid the use of the German name Diesel, unpopular after World War I.  History  Prototype of GE three-power-boxcab delivered as NYC #1525 The prototype of these locomotives was New York Central 1525 delivered in February 1928. This locomotive had a center-cab design. After successful testing a series of 40 locomotives with boxcab carbodies were built along with the line of the ALCO boxcabs by a consortium of ALCO, General Electric, Ingersoll Rand and Electric Storage Battery. ALCO built the locomotive frame, carbody and running gear, General Electric built the generator, traction motors and controls, Ingersoll Rand provided the diesel engine, and the traction batteries were made by the Electric Storage Battery Co. of Philadelphia (now Exide). The locomotives were mainly used in city areas for switching work, where exhaust-emissions-free operation was required at spurs entering factory halls. The main batch was ordered by New York Central Railroad to be used in the New York City area operating on the West Side Line and the High Line. Some three-power boxcabs also worked Chicago, Detroit, and Boston. One locomotive was built for Rock Island, which used it for switching the LaSalle Street Station in Chicago.  Technical Description  The principle of operation was similar to that of modern hybrid locomotives, the diesel engine driving a main generator of 600 volts DC, which provided charging current to a bank of batteries which powered four traction motors, one per axle. In addition to being powered by the diesel engine, these locomotives were capable of operating as electric locomotives. Two of these locomotives were equipped to operate off of 3000 volt overhead lines, and 34 were capable of operating off of a 600 volt third rail. The locomotives were equipped with a six-cylinder four-stroke in-line engine of . The diesel motor was used to charge the batteries, which could not be charged by third rail power. The battery consisted of 240 Exide Ironclad cells with a total capacity of 301 kWh. See also * ALCO boxcab, and GE boxcab, diesel- electric variants of these locomotives.

Jenny was raised in a family of nine at a fourth-floor flat near Battersea Power Station. In 1968, the attractive young blonde arrived in Weatherfield from London in search of her sister Monica, who had written to her telling her that she was staying with Dennis who was \\"a bit square but a nice guy\\". Monica was in fact part of Robert Croft's hippy commune camping out at 11 Coronation Street. After being put onto Dennis, Jenny joined the hippies even though she thought they were crazy. When the hippies moved on, Jenny remained and Dennis got her a job at the hotel where he was employed as a barman. Whilst there she had to fend off the unwanted advances of waiter Maurice Rowe, and when Dennis stood up for her he realised his affection for her. Jenny knew that Dennis liked her but returned to the South anyway. Dennis followed her and they became a couple while in London. In March, they returned to Weatherfield and Jenny met Dennis's mother Elsie. Elsie gave them a hard time - they pretended to be married so she'd let them sleep together, but Jenny came clean with Elsie (although she'd seen through Dennis's lie anyway) and Elsie made Dennis sleep in the parlour. Elsie didn't take their relationship seriously as Dennis had never had a long-term relationship, and made Jenny feel unwelcome. When Jenny brought this up with Dennis, he told Elsie to be nicer to Jenny but things didn't improve so Jenny decided to return to London. To stop her, Dennis persuaded Minnie Caldwell to take her in at No.5, though they were surprised that the kindly pensioner was just as uncompromising about letting them sleep together as Elsie was. Minnie did, however, have a go at Elsie and make her realise how badly she was treating Jenny. After a few weeks Jenny got a job as a demonstrator at Ashworths, selling kitchen equipment. Jenny and Dennis decided to get engaged - although it was badly timed as Monica had also just got engaged, and their father Ernie refused to pay for two weddings. As Monica was marrying a bank manager, Ernie supported that union and Dennis had to borrow money to pay for his and Jenny's nuptials. Jenny and Dennis got married on 29 May. During his bridegroom's speech, Dennis confessed to Jenny that he had to be in Bristol that evening to see his boss. Jenny didn't mind. It turned out to be a good move. as Dennis's boss was so impressed with his devotion to the company that he offered Dennis the position of area manager, based in Bristol. Jenny got a transfer at Ashworths and the Tanners moved. Before leaving Weatherfield, Jenny conspired with Linda Cheveski, to have Elsie's nephew Gary Bailey go to Weatherfield to keep Elsie company. The Tanners were happily married until 1973 when Dennis was sent to prison for posing as a salesman in a scam to con old age pensioners. Jenny decided to make a clean break and start a new life, refusing to see Dennis or Elsie. Meeting with Ernie, Elsie blamed Jenny for what had happened to Dennis and couldn't believe that Jenny wasn't in on the scam or that she at least knew about it. Ernie insisted that the Tanners' marriage was now over and Jenny was having nothing to do with Dennis in future. Jenny and Dennis later divorced and she has not been seen or heard from since. Maggie Cooke Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Cooke (n√©e Preston, previously Clegg) is played by Irene Sutcliffe. She ran the Corner Shop from 1968 to 1974. Maggie's storylines included her life with alcoholic husband Les Clegg, whom she divorced in 1969, her adopted son Gordon (her sister Betty Turpin was his birth mother) and a further marriage to reformed alcoholic, Ron Cooke, on 10 July 1974. She emigrated to Zaire after the wedding but made a brief return to the street in December of the same year when Gordon found out that Betty was his mother. She rejoined her husband the following month and has not returned to the street since. In 2003, she was still living in Zaire. In 2012, when her sister Betty died, Maggie was not at the funeral or mentioned. A photograph of her was seen on the shelf in the background when Gordon, Emily, Rita and Stella went to Betty's house to sort through her belongings. In 2019, a writer from Soap World included Maggie and Ron's ceremony in their feature profiling soap weddings. They wrote \\"this marriage was sparked by a response to a lonely hearts ad in a newspaper!\\" Les Clegg Les Clegg is played by John Sharp. He and his wife Maggie buy the Corner Shop from David Barlow in 1968. Les was an alcoholic, and this leads to the breakup of their marriage; Maggie divorces Les in 1970. According to Betty Turpin, Les died sometime before Maggie's wedding to Ron Cooke. Gordon Clegg Gordon Clegg (also Preston), played by Bill Kenwright, made his first on-screen appearance on 15 April 1968. Kenwright played the role until 1995 and Geoffrey Leesley took over from 2002-04. On 31 January 2012, Sharon Marshall revealed Kenwright would reprise his role as Gordon for Betty Williams' funeral, which was broadcast in April that year. In 1968, Les Clegg bought the Corner Shop and the Cleggs moved there, with Gordon living in the flat above the shop. Maggie wanted Gordon to focus on his studies and not work behind the counter so Maggie was dismayed when Gordon fell for young Lucille Hewitt. Lucille took some convincing to agree to go out with Gordon, as she thought he was too mothered by Maggie, but he impressed her when he fought for her attentions with Gary Strauss and Ray Langton. Gordon and Lucille faced Maggie's objections when Gordon decided to show Lucille that he was committed to her by suggesting that they elope to Gretna Green and return as husband and wife, even though it would mean missing his exams. He and Lucille went to the railway station, without telling their families but when they missed their train; Lucille convinced him that they should return. Gordon passed his exams and began thinking about his career prospects. As Lucille pressed ahead with wedding preparations and set a date for Easter Saturday 1969, Gordon realised he could not marry her and cancelled the wedding. Ashamed of his actions, he took a job at the head office of an accountancy firm in London and upset Maggie by moving there permanently. In 1971, Gordon became engaged to Jennifer Swann. She visited Weatherfield to meet Maggie but she and Gordon did not marry. Gordon returned to Weatherfield in 1974 for Maggie and Ron Cooke's wedding. Gordon gave Maggie away and saw her off as she moved to Zaire with Ron. Gordon agreed to handle the sale of the shop but arranged to rent it to Megan \\"Granny\\" Hopkins for ¬£14 a week, with the money counting towards the eventual sale to the Hopkins'. Before returning to London, he infuriated Betty by having a one-night stand with Beverley Mather. The Hopkins' were determined to get a good deal on the shop and they found Gordon's birth certificate behind a sideboard, revealing his true mother's name. Granny Hopkins was intending to blackmail Gordon but Maggie told him the truth before the Hopkins' could. Gordon was stunned by the news and reacted initially by warning the Hopkins', who did a midnight flit, and going out to celebrate the fact that Les Clegg was not his father. After getting over the initial shock, he began treating Betty as his mother. In 1976, Gordon visited to arrange the sale of the shop to Renee Bradshaw. In 1982, Gordon married Caroline Wilson and they had a son, Peter, in 1985. In 1995, Gordon gave Betty away when she married wartime romance, Billy Williams. As Billy was an old flame of Betty's, Gordon wondered if he could be his father but Betty said that he was not. When Betty decided to retire in 2002, Gordon invited her to live with him and his family in Wimbledon, although Caroline was not keen on the idea. After some consideration, Betty decided to stay in Weatherfield as she enjoyed working too much. Gordon suggested it again the following year after Betty's house caught fire, but she did not stay with them long. In 2004, Gordon visited Betty and brought her flowers for her eighty-fourth birthday. Betty continued to visit Gordon for many more years, including Christmases. In 2012, he visited her when she was ill but learnt that she had died. Devastated, Gordon went to the Rovers Return to tell her friends. He planned to have her buried at a cemetery in London, but seeing how loved Betty was, he decided the right thing to do was have her buried next to Cyril in Weatherfield. Gordon went through her things with Emily Bishop, Rita Sullivan and then-Rovers landlady Stella Price. They found a letter written by former landlady Annie Walker which revealed that she wanted Betty to run the pub after she retired, but Stella did not want Gordon to know until she saw a solicitor. On the day of the funeral, they told Gordon about the letter but he knew that his mother was happy working at the pub although she had turned down the offer. At the wake in the Rovers Return, he read a letter from Betty, thanking all her friends for all the good years. Gordon handed barman Sean Tully another letter from Betty, containing her secret hotpot recipe. Gordon said goodbye before departing later in the evening.

History of Goygol Winery With the settlement of German immigrants to Azerbaijan from W√ºrttemberg in the early 19th century, the wine production in central Azerbaijan was modernized. The Germans who settled in the village of Khanliglar near the town of Goygol in 1819, established a German colony called Helenendorf. Shortly thereafter, they were engaged in grape growing and winemaking activities of the region. After substantial investments from Christoff Vohrer and Christian Hummel, the Goygol Winery opened in 1860. In 1862 they established two more companies in Helenendorf. The Vohrer Brothers company was managed by Christoff Vohrer and his sons Gottlob, Friedrich, Heinrich and Christopher. The Hummel Brothers Trading House was managed by Christian Hummel and his sons Jacob, Albert, Georg and Gotlieb. Both companies had chapters in Ganja, Baku, Tiflis, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, Tomsk and Batumi. After the establishment of Soviet rule in Azerbaijan, the company was abolished. In its place, the Soviet authorities created a Konkordia cooperative on August 8, 1922. The cooperative was the largest wine, cognac and vodka producer in the Caucasus. During the existence of the Azerbaijan SSR, the company was renamed to Khanlar Agrosenaye. It was the largest spirits producer in the Republic and ranked third in the Soviet Union for cognac production. During the Soviet rule, the plant produced 7% of the overall Soviet production of wines and spirits. In 1985, due to Gorbachev alcohol prohibition campaign, the winery stopped its production. After the restoration of independence of Azerbaijan, the winery was rebuilt and eventually bought by Vinagro LLC. Vinagro competes in international markets. The company consists of the grape Reception Division, a secondary wine processing department, a wine and cognac processing department, a vodka preparation and processing division, a cognac distillery and a cognac spirits preparation division.

Life Ashton was clerk of the closet to Mary of Modena, the wife of James II, and, after the revolution of 1688, showed himself ardently devoted to the interests of his exiled master and mistress. He appears to have held a commission of captain or major in the army, and to have heen an intimate friend of Dr. Thomas Cartwright, who was bishop of Chester from 1686 to 1689, and a zealous supporter of the Stuart dynasty.cf. Cartwright's Diary, pub. by Camden Soc. By religion Ashton was a Protestant, and late in 1690 he attended a meeting of Protestant Jacobites, at which it was resolved to invite Louis XIV of France to forcibly restore James II. Viscount Preston undertook to visit St. Germains with the papers requisite to obtain support for the conspiracy, and Ashton promised to arrange the journey and bear him company. He and a young friend, Major Elliott, hired a boat at London to convey themselves and Lord Preston to France, but the owner, whose suspicions were roused by their injunctions of secrecy, gave information to the government, and on 31 December 1690, when Preston, Ashton, and Elliott embarked with their treasonable papers about them at the Tower, they were narrowly watched, were arrested off Tilbury, and a few hours later brought back to Whitehall. On Ashton's person alone incriminating documents were found. The three prisoners were brought to trial a fortnight later, but each was tried separately. Ashton, who was described in the indictment as 'late of the parish of St. Paul's, Covent Garden,' declared that he was about to visit France to learn from the exiled queen how she proposed to settle certain unpaid debts with her London tradesmen, for many of which he, as her late clerk, was held responsible, and he called witnesses in support of his assertion. All the conspirators were, however, condemned to death, and Ashton, upon whom alone the sentence was executed, was hanged at Tyburn on 28 January 1691. Several nonjuring clergymen attended him after his conviction, and were present with him at the gallows. Before his death he handed to the sheriff a paper declaring himself a Protestant, and happy in losing his life in James II's service, from whom he had received favours 'for sixteen years past.' This document, which well exemplified the depth of the sincerity of James's supporters in England, was published in England, France, and Holland, and greatly alarmed the authorities. An answer to it was written anonymously by Dr. Edward Fowler, bishop of Gloucester, who represented Ashton's paper as the manifesto of the Jacobite party, and tried to confute in detail his arguments against the lawfulness of William III's accession to the throne: the bishop's pamphlet evoked a reply in the 'Loyal Traitor,' an elaborate defence of Ashton by a Jacobite. Ashton's widow, whose maiden name was Rigby, after her husband's death sought refuge at St. Germains with her son, upon whom James II conferred a baronetcy. But her Protestantism did not commend itself to the exiled court, and Mrs. Ashton was harshly used on her refusal to become a Roman Catholic. She died in 1694, and her body was sent to England for burial.View of the Court of St. Germains (1696), in Harleian Miscellany, vi. 395 References * Attribution Year of birth unknown 1691 deaths Jacobites People executed under the Stuarts for treason against England Executed English people English Protestants 17th-century Protestants 17th-century executions by England People executed by the Kingdom of England by hanging ","title":"John Ashton (Jacobite)"},{"id":"30227684","text":"Dalbergia obovata (climbing flat bean) is a robust shrub or climber in the family Fabaceae, and is native to Southern Africa.Viljoen, C.

Leaves and branchlet of Dalbergia obovata Description Dalbergia obovata is a canopy climber that grows up to 30 m tall in the wild or a small tree up to 6 m tall. It has modified, tendril-like branches that enable the plant to support itself on surrounding vegetation. The leaves are compound with alternate leaflets, and glossy green above and blue-grey beneath with a wavy margin. The flowers are produced in dense heads in the leaf axils and ends of the branchlets. The flowers are whitish and fragrant (sweetly scented). The fruits are flattened pods that are pale yellow to brown in colour, and form in clusters. Each pod contains 1-3 seeds. Taxonomic notes There is some variation between East African plants and the typical South African form: The leaflet-apices of East African specimens are less frequently pointed, there are few lateral nerves, and the fruits are generally relatively narrower and less hairy.Entry for DALBERGIA obovata E.

The heavy reddish wood is used for sticks and stools. A root infusion is used to treat stomach-ache and toothache, and the roots are used to make a Zulu love charm. The bark is used to treat sore mouths in babies and for making rope (twine), and ash from burnt bark is added to snuff. Dalbergia obovata is also used as a garden plant because of its showy flowers and can make an impenetrable hedge. The leaves can be used to feed livestock. Ecological significance As a legume these plants fix nitrogen in the soil for other plants to use. Beetles and a wide variety of other insects are attracted to the flowers. The leaves are heavily browsed by game animals. Dalbergia obovata is an important foodplant for Dassies (hyrax). These plants also provide food for birds. The leaves of Dalbergia obovata were noted being used on a daily basis to line the nest of a pair of green malkohas (Ceuthmochares aereus) while the eggs were being incubated, but this ceased once the eggs hatched.Chittenden, H and Upfold, G. (2009). Green Malkoha ‚Äì breeding strategy. http://www.birdinfo.co.za/landbirds/50_green_malkoha.htm, retrieved 29 December 2010. There were no Dalbergia obovata in the immediate vicinity of the nest, and the birds had to fly some distance to find the leaf species of their choice for nest lining.

The people in these villages belong to Batau tribe and consider themselves as one blood and are related through a deep long entrenched social history that is traced from Swaziland. They broke away from Swaziland around the year 1540. From mainline Swazi, Batau settled at Wakkerstroom and then Seokodibeng around 1624, at a place that is now called Lake Chrissie. From Lake Chrissie (Seokodibeng) they went to Mokwena River (which today is called Crocodile River) settling there in the late 17th century. Here the Batau established themselves as a nation outside the mainline Swazi and subsequently broke away from all Swazi identity - they shed their Swazi outlook and adopted new ways and customs especially those of the Mapulane, Tswana people and Sotho people. Compared to the surrounding communities of Makgophong, Mehlareng, Masemola, Malatane, Mamatonya and Marulaneng, Byldrift is the most warm hospitable and friendly community - people are proud of their heritage and rich African history.

The coin was slated to go into production later that year. Eight sculptors were invited to take part. The artists invited were Chester Beach, Victor David Brenner, Anthony de Francisci, John Flanagan, Henry Hering, Hermon Atkins MacNeil and Adolph Alexander Weinman. De Francisci's design was eventually chosen. As winner of the contest, de Francisci was awarded $1,500; the other seven participants were awarded $100 for their entries. Due to time constraints, de Francisci was unable to schedule a professional model to pose for the obverse depiction of Liberty. Instead, he opted to model his depiction of Liberty on his wife. In describing his technique, he stated \\"I opened a window of my studio and let the wind blow on her hair while she was posing for me.\\" The sculptor later stated that though his wife was the model for the coin, it did not depict a perfect likeness.

A revising group, led by Wu GuanYing, looked over the three designs, and found that the dolphin and Monkey King designs could cause problems with intellectual property rights, while the Ne Zha was not suitable. They considered looking for an alternative design, and Wu GuanYing came up with the idea of a cartoon cow.

Ottoman Armed Soldiers The Period of the Gunpowder Empires also known as the Era of the Islamic Gunpowders refers to the epoch of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal empires from the 16th century to the 18th century. The three empires were among the strongest and most stable economies of the early modern period, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture, while their political and legal institutions were consolidated with an increasing degree of centralisation. They underwent a significant increase in per capita income and population and a sustained pace of technological innovation. The empires were centralised from the Eastern Europe and North Africa in the west to between today's modern Bangladesh and Myanmar in the east. They were Islamic and had considerable military and economic success. Vast amount of territories were conquered by the Islamic gunpowder empires with the use and development of the newly invented firearms, especially cannon and small arms, in the course of imperial construction. Unlike in Europe, the introduction of gunpowder weapons prompted changes well beyond military organization. The Mughals, based in the Indian subcontinent, are recognised for their lavish architecture and for having heralded an era of proto-industrialization, while the Safavids created an efficient and modern state administration for Iran and sponsored major developments in the fine arts, and the sultan of the Constantinople-based Ottoman caliphate, also known as the Caesar of Rome, was the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and thus head of the Islamic world. Their powers, wealth, architecture, and various contributions significantly influenced the course of Asian history. The Hodgson-McNeill concept The phrase was coined by Marshall G.S. Hodgson and his colleague William H. McNeill at the University of Chicago. Hodgson used the phrase in the title of Book 5 (\\"The Second Flowering: The Empires of Gunpowder Times\\") of his highly influential three- volume work, The Venture of Islam (1974). Hodgson saw gunpowder weapons as the key to the \\"military patronage states of the Later Middle Period\\" which replaced the unstable, geographically limited confederations of Turkic clans that prevailed in post-Mongol times. Hodgson defined a \\"military patronage state\\" as one having three characteristics: > first, a legitimization of independent dynastic law; second, the conception > of the whole state as a single military force; third, the attempt to explain > all economic and high cultural resources as appanages of the chief military > families. Such states grew \\"out of Mongol notions of greatness,\\" but \\"[s]uch notions could fully mature and create stable bureaucratic empires only after gunpowder weapons and their specialized technology attained a primary place in military life.\\" McNeill argued that whenever such states \\"were able to monopolize the new artillery, central authorities were able to unite larger territories into new, or newly consolidated, empires.\\" Monopolization was key. Although Europe pioneered the development of new artillery in the fifteenth century, no state monopolized it. Gun-casting know-how had been concentrated in the Low Countries near the mouths of the Scheldt and Rhine rivers. France and the Habsburgs divided those territories among themselves, resulting in an arms standoff. By contrast, such monopolies allowed states to create militarized empires in Western Asia, Russia, and India, and \\"in a considerably modified fashion\\" in China, Korea, and Japan. Recent views on the concept More recently, the Hodgson-McNeill Gunpowder-Empire hypothesis has been called into disfavour as a neither \\"adequate [n]or accurate\\" explanation, although the term remains in use. Reasons other than (or in addition to) military technology have been offered for the nearly simultaneous rise of three centralized military empires in contiguous areas dominated by decentralized Turkic tribes. One explanation, called \\"Confessionalization\\" by historians of fifteenth century Europe, invokes examination of how the relation of church and state \\"mediated through confessional statements and church ordinances\\" lead to the origins of absolutist polities. Douglas Streusand uses the Safavids as an example: > The Safavids from the beginning imposed a new religious identity on their > general population; they did not seek to develop a national or linguistic > identity, but their policy had that effect. One problem of the Hodgson-McNeill theory is that the acquisition of firearms does not seem to have preceded the initial acquisition of territory constituting the imperial critical mass of any of the three early modern Islamic empires, except in the case of the Mughal empire. Moreover, it seems that the commitment to military autocratic rule pre-dated the acquisition of gunpowder weapons in all three cases. Nor does it seem to be the case that the acquisition of gunpowder weapons and their integration into the military was influenced by which variety of Islam the particular empire promoted. Whether or not gunpowder was inherently linked to the existence of any of these three empires, it cannot be questioned that each of the three acquired artillery and firearms early in their history and made such weapons an integral part of their military tactics. Gunpowder Empires of the Muslim world =Ottoman Empire= The bronze Dardanelles Gun on display at Fort Nelson in Hampshire. Similar cannons were used by the Ottoman Turks in the siege of Constantinople in 1453. The first of the three empires to acquire gunpowder weapons was the Ottoman Empire. By the 14th century, the Ottomans had adopted gunpowder artillery.Nicolle, David (1980). Armies of the Ottoman Turks 1300-1774. Osprey Publishing, . The adoption of the gunpowder weapons by the Ottomans was so rapid that they \\"preceded both their European and Middle Eastern adversaries in establishing centralized and permanent troops specialized in the manufacturing and handling of firearms.\\" But it was their use of artillery that shocked their adversaries and impelled the other two Islamic empires to accelerate their weapons programs. The Ottomans had artillery at least by the reign of Bayezid I and used them in the sieges of Constantinople in 1399 and 1402. They finally proved their worth as siege engines in the successful siege of Salonica in 1430. The Ottomans employed Middle-Eastern as well as European foundries to cast their cannons, and by the siege of Constantinople in 1453, they had large enough cannons to batter the walls of the city, to the surprise of the defenders. The Ottoman military's regularized use of firearms proceeded ahead of the pace of their European counterparts. The Janissaries had been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. During the rule of Sultan Mehmed II they were drilled with firearms and became \\"perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.\\" The Janissaries are thus considered the first modern standing armies.Lord Kinross (1977). Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire. New York: Morrow Quill Paperbacks, 52. .Goodwin, Jason (1998). Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire. New York: H. Holt, 59,179‚Äì181. . The combination of artillery and Janissary firepower proved decisive at Varna in 1444 against a force of Crusaders, Ba≈ükent in 1473 against the Aq Qoyunlu, and Moh√°cs in 1526 against Hungary. But the battle which convinced the Safavids and the Mughals of the efficacy of gunpowder was Chaldiran. The matchlock arquebus began to be used by the Janissary corps by the 1440s. The musket later appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465. Damascus steel was later used in the production of firearms such as the musket from the 16th century. At the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the Janissaries equipped with 2000 t√ºfenks (usually translated as musket) \\"formed nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row,\\" in a \\"kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest.\\" The Chinese later adopted the Ottoman kneeling position for firing. In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets. The Chinese Wu Pei Chih (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time. The Dardanelles Gun was designed and cast in bronze in 1464 by Munir Ali. The Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 340 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 casualties from this bombardment.Schmidtchen, Volker (1977b), \\"Riesengesch√ºtze des 15. Jahrhunderts. Technische H√∂chstleistungen ihrer Zeit\\", Technikgeschichte 44 (3): 213‚Äì237 (226‚Äì228) Persian Musketeer in time of Abbas I by Habib-Allah Mashadi after Falsafi (Berlin Museum of Islamic Art). At Chaldiran, the Ottomans met the Safavids in battle for the first time. Sultan Selim I moved east with his field artillery in 1514 to confront what he perceived as a Shia threat instigated by Shah Ismail in favor of Selim's rivals. Ismail staked his reputation as a divinely-favored ruler on an open cavalry charge against a fixed Ottoman position. The Ottomans deployed their cannons between the carts that carried them, which also provided cover for the armed Janissaries. The result of the charge was devastating losses to the Safavid cavalry. The defeat was so thorough that the Ottoman forces were able to move on and briefly occupy the Safavid capital, Tabriz. Only the limited campaign radius of the Ottoman army prevented it from holding the city and ending the Safavid rule. =Safavid Empire= Although the Chaldiran defeat brought an end to Ismail's territorial expansion program, the shah nonetheless took immediate steps to protect against the real threat from the Ottoman sultanate by arming his troops with gunpowder weapons. Within two years of Chaldiran, Ismail had a corps of musketeers (tofangchi) numbering 8,000, and by 1521, possibly 20,000. After Abbas the Great reformed the army (around 1598), the Safavid forces had an artillery corps of 500 cannons as well as 12,000 musketeers. The Safavids first put their gunpowder arms to good use against the Uzbeks, who had invaded eastern Persia during the civil war that followed the death of Ismail I. The young shah Tahmasp I headed an army to relieve Herat and encountered the Uzbeks on 24 September 1528 at Jam, where the Safavids decisively beat the Uzbeks. The shah's army deployed cannons (swivel guns on wagons) in the centre protected by wagons with cavalry on both flanks. Mughal emperor Babur described the formation at Jam as \\"in the Anatolian fashion.\\" The several thousand gun-bearing infantry also massed in the centre as did the Janissaries of the Ottoman army. Although the Uzbek cavalry engaged and turned the Safavid army on both flanks, the Safavid centre held (because not directly engaged by the Uzbeks). Rallying under Tahmasp's personal leadership, the infantry of the centre engaged and scattered the Uzbek centre and secured the field. =Mughal Empire= Mughal matchlock. By the time he was invited by the Lodi governor of Lahore Daulat Khan to support his rebellion against Lodi Sultan Ibrahim Khan, Babur was familiar with gunpowder firearms and field artillery and a method for deploying them. Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formation‚Äîartillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center, and mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were defeated. The decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history. The reign of Akbar The Great, Shah Jahan and the Islamic Aurangzeb, represented the height of the Indian history. Mughal musketeer  Gunpowder Empires of East Asia  The three Islamic Gunpowder Empires are known for their quickly gained success in dominating the battle fields using their newly acquired firearms and techniques. East Asian powers and their military success are commonly overlooked in this subject due to the success of not only the Islamic Empires, but also European Empires. The success and innovation of gunpowder combat in East Asia, however, are worth mentioning in the same context as that of the Islamic Gunpowder Empires for their military advancements. = China = There were various ways that small firearms came to China. During the golden age of East Asian Piracy between the 1540s and 1560s, it was most likely that through their battles and other encounters with these pirates, the Ming forces inevitably got hold of the weapons and copied them. It was also likely that a powerful mariner Wang Zhi, who controlled thousands of armed men eventually surrendered to the Ming in 1558 and they replicated his weapons. This particular account on arquebus technology was the first to spark the interest of Ming officials for the Chinese to broaden their use of these weapons. Turkish arquebuses may have reached China before Portuguese ones. In Zhao Shizhen's book of 1598, the Shenqipu, there were illustrations of Ottoman Turkish musketmen with detailed illustrations of their muskets, alongside European musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets. There was also illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position in firing. Zhao Shizhen described the Turkish muskets as being superior to the European muskets. The Wu Pei Chih (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time. The Chinese intensively practiced tactical strategies based on firearm use which resulted in military success. Qi Jiguang, a revered Ming military leader, drilled his soldiers to extremes so that their performance in battle would be successful. In addition, Qi Jiguang also used innovative battle techniques like the volley, counter march, dividing into teams, and even encouraged having a flexible formation to adapt to the battle field. During the Sino-Dutch War beginning in 1661, Ming commander Zheng Chenggong used similar tactics to Qi Jiguang effectively in battle. While the Dutch may have had superior weapons, the Chinese were able to defeat Dutch forces through their strict adherence to discipline and their ability to stay in formation. Ultimately, it was their technique and training that defeated the Dutch weapons. A soldier from the Qianlong era, holding an arquebus. In 1631, \\"Heavy Troops\\" that could build and operate European-style cannon, The imported cannons in the Qing Dynasty had a high reputation such as 'Great General in Red'. The Manchu elite did not concern themselves directly with guns and their production, preferring instead to delegate the task to Han-Chinese craftsmen, who produced for the Qing a similar composite metal cannon known as the \\"Shenwei grand general.\\" Cannons and muskets are also widely used in wars known as 'Ten Great Campaigns'.Millward 2007, p. 95.F.W. Mote, Imperial China 900‚Äì1800 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1999), 936‚Äì939 However, after the Qing gained hegemony over East Asia in the mid-18th century, the practice of casting composite metal cannons fell into disuse until the dynasty faced external threats once again in the Opium War of 1840, at which point smoothbore cannons were already starting to become obsolete as a result of rifled barrels. = Japan = The Japanese adopted the use of the Portuguese arquebus in the middle of the 16th century. Multiple accounts have said that Portuguese men working for Chinese pirates ended up in Japan by chance and impressed the local ruler with the weapons. Soon after, the Japanese started mass-producing the Portuguese style weapon for themselves. In other accounts, this firearm technology may have trickled in to Japan as early as 1540 from the constant in and out flow of Japanese mercenaries who could have picked up firearms in their travels. Soon, Japanese soldiers carrying firearms would greatly outnumber those with other weapons. Tonio Andrade cited that the Military Revolution Model that gave the Europeans so much military success included the use of superior drilling techniques. The drilling technique he was speaking of was the musketeer volley technique. The volley technique was said to have been invented by Japanese Warlord Oda Nobunaga. He used the same technique that Japanese archers used, but the effect that the technique had to allow soldiers to reload at the same time others could fire was devastating to their enemies. = Korea = Koreans had been using Chinese and self made firearms as early as the late 14th century. They were also quite adept and innovative with their strategies on the battle field. In fact, there were accounts of Koreans using a type of volley technique in 1447. But a war between the Japanese against the Koreans and the Ming starting in 1592 and ending in 1598 would change the Korean's perspective on warfare. While it was a devastating defeat to the Koreans, this war forced the Koreans to realize that they needed to adopt the use of the musket as well as Japanese and Chinese methods. The Koreans quickly issued the musket as the base of their military tactic, and their musketeers became more than 50 percent of the military by 1594. They trained using manuals based on Qi Jiguang's techniques such as the volley, while incorporating their own methods too. These events marked the beginning of a Korean military revolution in which the Koreans could combat their enemies using modern equipment and methods of warfare. There were many instances where the Korean military used their new techniques effectively. In 1619, the Koreans aided the Ming against the Manchus, a great military force. While the Koreans and Ming lost, a Korean unit did exhibit their techniques successful in battle. Then, in 1627 and 1636, the Koreans faced the Manchus alone, again showing their competency in battle by using their musket tactics. Again, they lost in battle to the Manchus in both battles. In 1654 and 1658, the Koreans aided the Qing in battle against the Russians for control over land in Manchuria. In these instances, the Koreans showed their superior tactics and were the reason for the Russians' defeat.  Gunpowder in Europe  The Europeans in the Eurasian region were among the major groups. However, they were the last to learn about the secret of gunpowder, but that did not prevent them from making a name in the development of gunpowder just as the gunpowder empires. Europeans are said to have pushed gunpowder technology to its limits and improved the formulas that existed and devised new uses of the substance. Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an-Tianshan. Roger Bacon The introduction of gunpowder in Europe came through the rich Silk Road Trade in the thirteenth century. During the time, the chemical formula for gunpowder and process of refinement that reached Europe was already in completed form. Roger Bacon, a renowned early European alchemist (1214 ‚Äì 1292), set forth the marvels of the world and key among them was listing the ingredients of gunpowder which was very instrumental in guiding Europeans in advancing the technology of gunpowder. Having the ingredients revealed to them, European scientists, inventors and alchemists were ready to improve gunpowder and they created corned gunpowder. Corned gunpowder was the same as normal gunpowder in terms of chemical composition but had a different refinement process. This process of mixing entailed adding a wet substance to the gunpowder and then drying it up as a mixture. With this improved gunpowder technology, German friar, Berthold Schwarz invented the first European cannon in 1353. The Europeans improved the gunpowder firearms which had been made in China and Middle East and out of this improvement the Europeans metal-smiths were able to create stronger and more durable rifles using their advanced European metal work techniques. The Europeans also learnt how to calculate the amount of force of the gas that is contained in the gun chamber. The result of this knowledge was that the Europeans made guns that had the power to fire greater distances. Though Europe was not mentioned among the gunpowder empires, its contribution to gunpowder technology advancement in the Eurasian region and the world is significant. Though gunpowder did not originate from Europe, advances were made there. Europeans were improving gunpowder a century after the first gun was invented in China and by Chinese. Improved gunpowder from Europe later, in 1520, reached China by a Portuguese ship, though Turkish arquebuses may have reached China before Portuguese ones. The Ottomans and Portuguese introduced the cannon, improved rifles and other advancements to China, hundreds of years after gunpowder's original invention in China, bringing gunpowder's journey through Asia full circle.

Life Dallington was born at Geddington, Northamptonshire. He entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and was there from about 1575 to 1580; from his incorporation at Oxford as M.A. it is deduced that he held that degree from Cambridge, though this is unrecorded. Dallington then became a schoolmaster in Norfolk. The Puritan Norfolk family of Butts acted as patrons at this period of his life.Roy Strong, Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance (2000), pp. 16-17. In 1594 he contributed a gratulatory poem to Lewes Lewkenor's The Resolved Gentleman. After a few years, Dallington set out on a leisurely journey through France and Italy: a Grand Tour, and in fact the first of two, one in 1595 to 1597, followed by another in 1598 to 1600. On his return he became secretary to Francis Manners; they had been in Italy together on the second tour, and the party then may have included the young Inigo Jones.Michael Leapman, Inigo (2004), p. 111. The first tour was with Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, elder brother of Francis. Dallington was from 1605 a gentleman of the privy chamber in ordinary to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (on the recommendation of the Earl of Rutland) and in receipt of a pension of ¬£100. Anthony Wood says that he filled the same office in Prince Charles's household. In 1624, on Prince Charles's recommendation, Dallington was appointed master of Charterhouse in succession to Francis Beaumont; and to Charles he probably owed the knighthood which was conferred on him 30 December in the same year. As early as 1601 Dallington had been incorporated at St. John's College, Oxford; but though he was now Forty years-old he was still only in deacon's orders, and at the same time the governors resolved that no future master should be elected under forty years of age, or who was not in holy orders of priesthood two years before his election, and having not more than one living, and that within thirty miles of London. While master, Dallington improved the walks and gardens of Charterhouse, and introduced into the school the custom of versifying on passages of scriptures. In 1636 Dallington had grown so infirm that the governors appointed three persons to assist him in his duties of master. In the following year he died, seventy-six years old. Two years before his death Dallington had, at his own expense, built a schoolhouse in his native village, Geddington; he also gave the great bell of the parish church and provided for the poor. Works While occupying a teaching position he edited and published A Booke of Epitaphes made upon the Death of Sir William Buttes (by R. D. and others, edited by R. D.). Eight of these epitaphs, some in English, the others in poor Latin verse, were composed by Dallington himself. Also as R. D. he translated into English the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of Francesco Colonna. Roy Strong regards the connection of Dallington with the court of Prince Henry as significant as a filiation of Italianate taste. He wrote an account of his travels. A Survey of the Great Duke's State of Tuscany, in the yeare of our Lord 1596, which appeared in 1605, and was followed the next year by A Method for Travell: shewed by taking the view of France as it stoode in the yeare of our Lord 1598.

(London: Routledge, 2000), pp. 143-60 In addition to the works mentioned above, Dallington published in 1613 a book entitled Aphorismes Civill and Militarie, amplified with authorities, and exemplified with historie out of the first Quaterne of F. Guicciardine (a briefe inference upon Guicciardine's digression, in the fourth part of the first Quaterne of his Historie, forbidden the impression and effaced out of the originall by the Inquisition).

Published in book form on October 13, 1968, the play was first produced on stage the following year and ran January 18‚Äì31, 1969. In one of these productions, Mishima himself played Adolf Hitler.  Inspiration  Mishima was inspired by the assassination of Ernst Roehm in Night of the Long Knives and was intrigued by Hitler. However, more of his influence for Hitler‚Äôs character came from one of his other plays . Since Mishima's other play Sado Koshaku fujin (Madame de Sade) stars an all-female cast, he wanted My Friend Hitler to be an all-male cast. According to Mishima himself he wanted to refute criticism claiming that he could not portray both genders.  About the play  The play is written in third person. The four characters are Adolf Hitler, Gustav Krupp, Gregor Strasser and Ernst R√∂hm (from whose text the play's title is taken). The play takes place over the summer of 1934 at the Berlin chancellery. The reviews and critiques of the play vary, as some call it anti-fascistKim A. –ê–¥–æ–ª—å—Ñ, –∫–æ–º—É —Ç—ã –¥—Ä—É–≥? while others claim that it preaches fascism.Great Soviet Encyclopedia see  Plot  The play begins with Hitler giving a speech to the people of Germany, during which his two friends Krupp and R√∂hm come in to watch the speech. They talk to each other and discuss the \\"iron bouquet\\" Krupp metaphorically used to set into motion great advancements in human history, including shaping Hitler into a better leader. Later in the play, Strasser enters the scene. He has a bad relationship with R√∂hm. Krupp describes their relationship as that of a \\"cat and dog\\". Strasser then argues that the war profits need to be returned to the country. R√∂hm gets mad, calling him a socialist. After the speech is finished, Hitler returns to the group awaiting him and gets their reports about the peoples' reaction to the speech, all of them telling him it was outstanding, even calling Hitler an artist. Hitler then talks to R√∂hm alone about how they were so close to each other, but now that he is so busy running the country and doesn't have the time anymore to talk about the \\"good old days\\" with one of his trusted friends. Hitler then decides to get away from his political life for the day. And so R√∂hm decides to train Hitler on everything he needs to know about being a military leader.

Its contain nine contributing properties, all wood frame buildings from the mid-19th century in variations and combinations of the Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles. In 1985 the group was recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Armonk's history began with the buildings, erected in the mid-19th century when the congregants of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, the oldest building in the district, subdivided and sold the large parcel the church was on to their rector in order to give the church a solid financial footing. In selling the land for house construction, the congregation was the first to use the name Armonk for the area, and the properties have likewise been described as the hamlet's first residential subdivision. Architecturally, the houses and church are a rare surviving group in classically-inspired styles in that part of Westchester County. Some are used as professional offices today. The church's cemetery, in which many of the inhabitants of the houses and other early residents of North Castle are buried, is also part of the district. Since its construction, the district has undergone some changes. Another, smaller house was built within it in the 1880s. The church has gone through several parsonages, one of which has been demolished, along with an additional building used as a girls' school. Highway construction and relocations following IBM's 1964 choice of Armonk for its corporate headquarters changed Bedford Road from a major through route to a dead-end street. In the early 21st century the redevelopment of the land north of the district into Armonk Square, a mixed- use shopping center and apartment complex required the construction of a street in the middle of the district to meet parking requirements, a move which was highly controversial within the community. Geography The roughly L-shaped district is located along the north side of the road, in the southern section of downtown Armonk. Its boundaries mostly follow land lot lines, beginning one lot east of Main Street (also New York State Route 128 (NY 128)) and taking in the next seven lots to the west, crossing Elm Street, where 44 Bedford Road, the church's former rectory, now has its frontage, in the process. At Maple Avenue, where St. Stephen's church is located, it extends further north than the other rear lot lines almost to that street's westward turn. On these lots are 12 buildings, most located on lots. Eight of them‚Äîthe six houses, one outbuilding and the church‚Äîare considered contributing properties to the district's historic character. The church's cemetery is further included as a contributing site. The remaining three buildings are all non-contributing detached modern garages. alt=A map of the district, showing its boundary as a bright red line To the south of the district, across the street, is North Castle's town hall, a mid-20th century brick Colonial Revival building. It is the center of a municipal complex that includes parking lots, baseball fields and other auxiliary government buildings between Bedford Road and New York State Route 22 (NY 22), at this point a divided four-lane highway, with IBM's corporate headquarters opposite. East of the district is the Wampus River, a tributary of the Byram, buffered on either side by public parks. Bedford Road continues for before reaching a dead end at one of the exit ramps for the interchange of Interstate 684 and NY 22. North of the district is the Armonk Square development, a mix of retail and residential properties. The rest of downtown Armonk, a mix of residential buildings on side streets with larger institutional and commercial buildings on and near main, moderately developed with many large interspersed mature shade trees, is to the northwest. The terrain of the district, like downtown as a whole, is level, one of the few large breaks in an otherwise continuously hilly region. Buildings Except as noted below, the houses have a number of features in common‚Äîtimber framing, two stories, side-gabled roofs, modern siding, six- over-six double-hung sash windows with louvered wooden shutters. Also, construction date is ca. 1850 unless noted otherwise. Two buildings, both former parsonages, that were erected by the church, have since been demolished. One, built across Bedford Road from the church in the 1850s, was demolished almost a century later when the town hall was built. The other, the former home of a girls' school established by the church, was extant at the time of the Register listing but was considered non-contributing due to extensive modifications and deterioration at the time; the district's boundaries were thus drawn to exclude it. It was demolished around 1990 to clear the way for a mixed-use development on the land north of the district where it had been sited, vacant and neglected for several decades. *12 Bedford Road: Like its neighbor at 16 Bedford, the westernmost house in the district is on a lot with only of frontage. It has an asphalt-shingled roof with return eaves pierced by a central brick chimney. On the three-bay south (front) facade is a wraparound veranda with a hipped roof supported by Doric columns with entases; the paneled entrance door has sidelights. A rear addition and detached garage are of more modern construction and non-contributing. *16 Bedford Road: Also three bays wide, the next house is the only one with a front gable. At ground level a stone foundation is visible. The Doric pillars support the hipped roof of a front porch. It was moved to its present location in 1888. *24 Bedford Road: A driveway separates 16 Bedford from the next house over, a more sophisticated four-by-three-bay structure with a side gable and two brick end chimneys piercing its roof. It has no porch or veranda; however, on the east of the front facade is a two-story bay window with two-over-two double-hung sash, added in 1880. The main entrance, immediately adjacent on the west, has a Greek Revival door surround, sidelights, Doric pilasters and a full Doric entablature. In the house's rear is another modern non-contributing detached garage. *30 Bedford Road: Also known as the Nehemiah Searles House, this four-by-three structure retains its original clapboard siding. Its roof is pierced by a single brick chimney at the east end; at the roofline are Yankee gutters and return eaves. Among its windows are some six-light casement windows; all have molded surrounds. The main entrance is on the west side with an enclosed vestibule. Another non-contributing detached modern garage is in the rear. *40 Bedford Road: At two and a half stories this is the tallest of the houses. Two brick end chimneys pierce its roof, which is distinguished by wide fasciae at the roofline above a row of three-light casement eyebrow windows. The centrally located main entrance on the five-bay facade has a semi-circular Colonial Revival porch supported by two pillars with a conical roof. It has a similar door treatment to 24 Bedford, with a transom taking the place of the entablature. In the rear, north of a parking lot, is the only contributing outbuilding in the district. It is a small timber frame structure with clapboard siding and a gabled roof on a stone foundation. In the front a small entrance ramp provides access to one of two vertical board doors; there is another one at the west end of the south facade. *44 Bedford Road. At the time of the National Register listing, the former rectory for St. Stephen's Church was located at the end of a short driveway. That has since become part of an extended Elm Street; however, the building's address has not been changed and the building's three-bay south (front) facade still faces Bedford Road. It was built in 1880, making it the newest of the district's houses. This one-and-a-half-story frame structure on a concrete-covered foundation, sided in clapboard and wood shingle with a front-gabled roof, is the smallest of the district's houses. Most of the windows are the same six-over-six double-hung sash as that seen on the other houses; there is one six-light casement on the south. The foundation windows are all three-light casement. The south facade also has a hip-roofed veranda with exposed rafters. It is supported by turned posts rising from a millwork balustrade. The main entrance, on the west, has a paneled door. On the north side there is a one- story two-by-one-bay shed-roofed addition. It has a secondary entrance. =St. Stephen's Episcopal Church= alt=A white church with four narrow points atop its square steeple and columns in front of its entrance flanked by tall trees. Built in 1842, this Greek Revival church at 50 Bedford Road is the oldest building in the district. Its clapboard-clad facades rise to a front-gabled roof topped by a two-stage tower with belfry. On its north (rear) is a non- contributing mid-20th century Sunday school wing. The main entrances, on the south facade, are on either side of a recessed porch. Two round fluted Doric columns in antis are in the center, flanked by square Doric pilasters. The porch is topped by a full entablature and pediment. The tall, narrow rectangular stained glass windows on the east and west sides are set in decorative surrounds. Inside the church has been remodeled in the Gothic Revival style; the pews are arranged so that there is no center aisle. Both stages of the tower have corner pilasters topped by molded cornices with broad overhanging eaves; the second stage has louvered vents. Atop are four narrow wooden steeples connected by a balustrade. To the rear and west of the church, filling out most of the remainder of its two-acre () lot, is its cemetery, considered a contributing site to the district. It contains approximately 450 marked graves, dating to 1844 at the earliest. To its south it is bordered by a wood post and rail fence, with a more modern stone fence topped with a wooden rail on the west, parallel to Elm Street. A wire fence sets it off on the east, leaving the north open. History The development of the district has until the late 20th century largely been driven by St. Stephen's Church. =1700s‚Äì1830: North Castle before the church= What is now the Town of North Castle was first settled by Europeans at the beginning of the 18th century. The colonial governor gave the town its name around 1721, when it was first used in records. Pound Ridge was split off from it in 1745. Even so, it still rivaled nearby Bedford as the most populous town in Westchester County as of the first U.S. census in 1790, the year before New Castle was created from the town's former northern portion. Most of the land in North Castle was ideal for agriculture, and thus the town was primarily known for its large farms. Over the century, a few small settlements had sprung up, such as Banksville, Kensico and Mile Square, the beginnings of today's Armonk. But despite the large and prosperous population, most of whom were of English descent and members of what had, after American independence, become the Episcopal Church, there was as of the early 19th century no house of worship in North Castle. Congregants had to go to Bedford, or other nearby towns such as Mount Kisco or White Plains, for services. A plan that had supposedly in the works in the early 1740s to build a church near the present St. Stephen's location was abandoned. Instead, one was built in 1761 at what is now North Castle Corners. =1831‚Äì1842: Establishment and construction of the church= This began to change in 1831, when The Rev. Robert William Harris was appointed rector of Grace Church in White Plains, one of those that North Castle residents traveled to for services. He took it upon himself to tend to the area's other congregations that did not have clerical leadership, including a growing group in Mile Square. By 1841 he was conducting informal services in a log cabin near the church's present site. Late in the following year the church was formally incorporated as St. Stephen's Church North Castle, Westchester County, New York. Harris was appointed its rector. The first order of business was to build a dedicated church, and two of the first committees formed had the tasks of raising money for that project and overseeing its planning and construction. The church soon settled on a draft plan, and the building committee was expanded. One of its new members, Elisha Sutton, donated a quarter-acre () from the northeast corner of his farm. After the committee budgeted $2,000 for the construction of the actual church, a vestryman, Ziel Eggleston, donated some of the lumber and built the church for free. =1843‚Äì1866: Development of neighboring land= With the church erected, the congregation concentrated on two more goals: financial stability and getting a pastor who would be exclusive to St. Stephen's. Harris proposed a way of ensuring both. The congregation should obtain a lot on which it could build a parsonage, or already had a suitable house. It would be owned by the vestrymen and wardens, who could purchase shares for a hundred dollars apiece. Once he was settled in the home, the new pastor would be able to buy back those shares at that same price when he so chose, and thus the house would over time revert to his ownership. He would also have to set up a girls' school in the building. It took until 1850 to begin to put this plan into action. A lot to the north and west of the church was purchased from the estate of Sutton, the congregant who had donated the church's original land. It would be subdivided into 40 lots, with two set aside to serve as a burial ground and parsonage (now 40 Bedford Road) respectively. Construction of the house on the latter lot was financed via subscription, to start when two-thirds of the possible subscriptions had been sold; like the church, its budget was capped at $2,000. The new land soon became known as \\"the Armonk Square\\", after the new name of the growing hamlet, derived from the Native American term for the area meaning \\"a valley or fishing place between hills\\" that the church officers were using to promote the available land. St. Stephens' officers heavily promoted the lots within it, and the houses to be built on it were expected to cost at least a thousand dollars. In 1852 a new pastor, The Rev. Isaac Dychman Vermilye, was appointed assistant rector and the principal of Chester Female Institute, the girls' school, then run out of the rectory. Early the next year, Rev. Harris resigned the rectorship, and Vermilye replaced him. The church's board also approved a plan to add classroom and dormitory space for at least 32 students to the parsonage; however, a separate structure (no longer extant) was built instead. Two years later the church formally adopted Harris's plan by which Vermilye would come to own the remaining lots and received the proceeds of their sale. alt=An old map showing a block of streets with lot lines and solid black rectangles representing buildings with their owners' names next to them. There is a river at the right Vermilye served as pastor through his death in 1864. The church prospered during this period, with its congregation including Major Gen. Alexander Hamilton, grandson of his namesake, whose service during the Civil War included commanding the Union Army troops that suppressed the New York City Draft Riots. After his death, the congregation conveyed the house and accompanying lots to his wife Josephine; she continued to operate the Female Institute for several years. =1867‚Äì1888: Renovations and other improvements= In 1867, Vermilye's successor, The Rev. Cornelius Winter Bolton, referred to as just C.W. Bolton, became rector. In 13 years, he oversaw significant renovations to the church. The original clear glass side windows were replaced with stained glass and the original pew doors were removed. Across the street, he supervised the construction of a new rectory (no longer extant), since Josephine Vermilye was still living in the original one. The changes to the church and its surroundings continued after Bolton left in 1880. Four years later, the church bought from Josephine Vermilye, who was still living at 30 Bedford, two of the lots of the Square in order to expand its cemetery. Around the same time, 44 Bedford Road, the last of the district's contributing properties, was built. In 1888, 16 Bedford was moved from its location closer to 24 Bedford and converted from a shoemaking shop into a residence. At the other end of the district, the church's interior was renovated, with the original gallery removed and the entire sanctuary redone in the more contemporary Gothic Revival style, the only concession to tastes that had changed since church and accompanying buildings were constructed. Vermilye later sold her house to a family whose members lived in it and grew an extensive vegetable garden throughout the first half of the 20th century. =1889‚Äì1984: Effects of Armonk's growth= As the 20th century dawned, the automobile made its presence felt in Armonk. Three of the Bedford Road houses had garages built behind them in the 1910s. Westchester's growing suburbanization made itself felt in Armonk, which was not on the railroad lines that had fed that growth, in the early part of that decade when New York City's continuing growth necessitated the construction of Kensico Reservoir two miles (3.2 km) to the south. Kensico, the hamlet that had given the reservoir its name, was abandoned and flooded. Some of its former residents resettled in Armonk, further contributing to its growth.North Castle Historical Society, North Castle History, Vol. 10, 1983, p. 20. Retrieved May 15, 2014. During the next decade, New York began to build its state highway system to serve its growing population of motorists. Bedford Road was designated part of what has since become NY 22 in 1924, and then a decade later NY 128 was routed along Bedford Road as well. These developments brought traffic from the city and Greenwich, Connecticut, respectively, into Armonk from the south along Bedford Road. Thus, in 1948, North Castle decided to build its new town hall complex on the south side, opposite the church and houses. This required the demolition of the new parsonage that Rev. Bolton had had built in the 1860s. The church repurchased 30 Bedford Road to serve as the parsonage; it has remained in their ownership. A decade later, the last member of the family Josephine Vermilye had sold her house to died; the heirs in turn sold it to a man who used it as an auction house for several years before closing that business down. It remained unused until its demolition late in the century. A decade and a half later, Armonk and Bedford Road would face another transformation. In 1964 IBM moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to the hills south of the hamlet, between it and the Connecticut state line. By the end of the decade the state had begun construction of Interstate 684 to handle the increased traffic. In conjunction with the construction of I-684's Armonk interchange just to the hamlet's west, the state highways were realigned off Bedford Road. NY 22, which had followed the Old Post Road into town past IBM, now overlapped with New York State Route 120 for a short distance at the north end of the reservoir to a new four-lane divided highway that bypassed Armonk to the south on its way to the interstate exit. Similarly, NY 128 was truncated so that it followed an extension of Main Street to end at a new intersection with NY 22. Both no longer followed Bedford Road, which in turn was vacated to a dead end at one of the interchange's offramps, greatly reducing passing traffic. =1985‚Äìpresent: Redevelopment= In the years after the historic district was delineated and listed on the National Register, Armonk began to become a desirable suburb despite its distance from local commuter rail lines. Residential property values rose in the area, and developers began looking at opportunities to build commercial projects downtown, where demand was quickly outgrowing the buildings that had served the hamlet well through its time as a country town and early years of suburbanization. Of particular interest was the property just north of the district, part of the original lots the church and the Vermilyes had subdivided and sold. However, development had been hindered by toxic waste contamination of groundwater in the area. For years several dry cleaners had dumped and spilled their waste chemicals in the area, until the county health department discovered the extent of the pollution in 1979. Downtown Armonk had been declared a Superfund site, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency was supplying affected homes and businesses with bottled water while monitoring it. During the late 1980s, a developer proposed a project called Heritage Square, with condominiums and residences, to be built mostly on the land that had once been the Vermilyes'. It would solve the water problems via a pipeline from a similar condominium project in the town of New Castle to the north. But local opposition to that aspect and the extra parking it would require blocked it. In the late 2000s, the Armonk Square project, a development mixing commercial space and one-room apartments with a supermarket, was proposed. In order to meet town parking requirements and provide access from the south, Elm Street was upgraded from a driveway serving 44 Bedford Road into a full paved public street. This met with heavy opposition from local preservationists as well as the state's Historic Preservation Office, who claimed it would needlessly divide the historic district. After a slight reduction in size, the project was completed and opened in 2014. Aesthetics The identity of the church's architect is not known. The building's application of the vernacular Greek Revival style is unusual for its eclecticism. It uses aspects of the style more frequently associated with academic buildings, such as the Doric columns and entablature on the front facade; the window surrounds on the sides are also not commonly found on vernacular Greek Revival churches. At that time the Greek Revival style for churches was at its highest; there would have been many other churches to influence the design. The Doric facade and recessed porch were prominent features of the 1835 St. James' Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, based on patterns by Minard Lefever; the Town and Davis Carmine Street Church, also in Manhattan and of the same era, had the same feature and was also widely imitated. In turn, St. Stephen's seems to have influenced later churches in Westchester such as the Methodist Church of Mamaroneck and the Banksville Baptist Church. Its side entrances are unique among those churches, however. The church'a cemetery follows the standard churchyard pattern of the time it was established. Graves are laid out in a regular north‚Äìsouth rows, filling most of the space allotted, with no overall landscaping evident. All graves are marked by single stones, generally either simple white marble markers from the time of settlement to more elaborate granite stones typical of the later Victorian period, with a few more modern plain markers. There are no crypts or large monuments, nor fenced groupings. Between the early 1850s and 1867, all the remaining houses in the district were built save 44 Bedford Road. They show differing degrees to which the Federal style that had characterized American architecture at the beginning of the century was being supplanted by the similarly neoclassical Greek Revival mode. At the west end, 12 and 16 Bedford are, befitting smaller houses, very restrained in their application of the style, the former showing it mostly in form and its sidehall entrance plan, with minimal ornament. Next door, 16 Bedford Road, a former shoemaker's shop located at 24 Bedford until 1888, uses its front-gable orientation to suggest a pediment. On the other end of the district and its stylistic extreme is 40 Bedford Road, the original rectory. With a more openly cubic form, and post and lintel construction openly recalling classical Greek architecture, it establishes itself firmly in the emerging Greek Revival. The two-and-a-half-story size is unusual in rural applications of the style; it is emphasized with the frieze windows. At the same time, its minimal decoration overall echoes the simplicity of the Georgian style that prevailed during the 18th century. In between are 24 and 30 Bedford, both buildings where the Federal influence is stronger. Their vertical forms and lighter proportions are more in keeping with the earlier style. Similar applications from their time period can be found in rural communities in this part of New York and adjacent regions of New England. The last house built, 44 Bedford, hews closely to the same style. Despite being the smallest in size, it retains the same general forms and materials as its older neighbors. This suggests a conscious effort to retain stylistic continuity with the buildings around it rather than embrace newer styles such as the Picturesque and other less restrained Victorian trends that had emerged in the decades since St. Stephen's and the other Bedford Road houses had been built. It also reflects the influence exerted on Armonk's builders by the more conservative architectural trends of nearby Connecticut rather than the rest of the Hudson Valley, where the Picturesque took hold early. However, the novelty siding, porch and porch detailing are more in accord with post Civil War houses. Preservation In 1978 North Castle established a Landmarks Preservation Committee. It has nine members, appointed to staggered three-year terms by the Town Board, at least one of whom must be an architect, civil engineer, historian, or realtor.North Castle Town Code, ¬ß 126-3 , 4 , adopted July 20, 1978 and retrieved May 17, 2014. It is charged with considering nominations for landmark status and any alterations to them that might impact their historic character. As the first residential subdivision in Armonk and the town's sole historic district, the Bedford Road properties are one of its major concerns.

Averell was born on 7 May 1754 at Mullan, county Tyrone, where his family had settled in the sixteenth century. His parents were of the established church, and related to Dr. John Averell, bishop of Limerick, who died in 1771, aged 58. In 1773 Averell went to Trinity College, Dublin, the provost being the Right Hon. Francis Andrews, nephew of Bishop Averell. In 1774 he became private tutor to Sir Richard St. George. He was ordained at Clonfert by Bishop Cope on 25 July 1777, but took no charge. At this period he met John Wesley in Dublin, and heard him preach. In 1781 he went to Eton with his pupils; the next year he became alienated from his patron, St. George. On 18 December 1785 he married the daughter and heiress of the Rev. R. Gregory of Tentower, Queen's County. He was at this time in the habit of preaching against the Methodists, and lived as a man of the world, enjoying cards, hunting, and dancing. Two circumstances produced a change ‚Äî the reading of Wesley's 'Appeal,' and an illness which seized him during some private theatricals. Becoming evangelical in his views and habits, he acted as curate to Dr. Ledwich at Aghaboe, 1789-91. He was offered in 1792 a curacy at Madeley, but preferred to exercise a gratuitous ministry nearer home. On 7 Oct, 1792 he preached for the first time to a Methodist congregation; in 1796 the Dublin conference admitted him to full connection. In 1797 he was separated from his wife. In the division which was the result of the controversy respecting the administration of the sacraments by the preachers (1814‚Äì18), Averell took a prominent part with the conservatives who adhered to Wesley's polity, declaring on 21 Jan. 1818 at Clones that the Methodists 'are not a church but a religious society.' The first meeting of the Primitive Wesleyan Methodist Conference was held on 10 July 1818; Averell was elected president, and constantly re-elected till after 1841, when his infirmities led him to decline office. He died on 16 Jan. 1847. The primitive Wesleyan body he represented (re-united since 1878, with few exceptions, to the Irish Wesleyan Conference) must not be confounded with the primitive Methodists of English origin.

The district contains 80 contributing buildings and one contributing site. It encompasses most of the original 1680 hamlet and is laid out in a typical village green plan. Notable buildings include the court house (1787), library (1807), school house (1829), post office (c. 1838), and Presbyterian church (1872). The buildings are good examples of the Greek Revival and Gothic Revival styles. Two of the buildings are now museums.  History  Bedford is northeast of New York City. It is on hilly terrain with light soil. The settlers in Bedford came from Connecticut around 1680 and built a hamlet. The pattern of the settlement is common in Massachusetts but rare in New York State. The town was planned around a triangular common where three roads met. Around it were at first three plots, which were assigned by lot to the first 20 settlers who planned to farm in common. The concept worked only for a short time but left its mark on the structure of Bedford, which became a market town. It was at times the seat of the county government during the Revolutionary War and one of two county seats, with a county court house, until 1870. The common village green is surrounded by the court house from 1787, the Historical Hall from 1806, a library, which was previously the Bedford Academy, from 1807, a school house built from cut stone in 1829, a post office and a general store from around 1838, and the Presbyterian church in Gothic Revival style from 1872. The buildings represent a New England village in Westchester County. The hamlet was under a Connecticut license until 1700, when it was assigned to New York State on an order by King William. A Brief History of the Presbyterian Church at Bedford, N.Y. from the Year 1680 was written by Reverend Heroy and published in 1874. It describes the history of the building, including the laying of the cornerstone and the services celebrating the dedication of the then most recently restored building in 1872. The Westchester County Historical Society notes that the Bedford Village Historic District is of both historical and architectural importance as an unusual example of a \\"colonial New England pattern of home plots and jointly owned farm land\\" in New York State. During the Revolutionary War, it served as a center of resistance, a supply center, and the home of a county government house. After the war, buildings in Federal style, Greek Revival style and Victorian style were erected in Bedford, which was for a long time \\"one of the most vital farming and trading centers in the county\\". The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in northern Westchester County in 1973. The Bedford Historical Society runs two museums, one in the former court house and another in the former school house.  Buildings  = 1787 Bedford Court House = Court House The court house was built in 1787. It is the oldest government building of Westchester County and one of three court houses in New York State from before 1800. It was erected for Bedford as the county seat from 1788 to 1870. In the court room were judges such as William Jay, son of John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States, and attorneys such as Aaron Burr, who later was vice president under Thomas Jefferson. The court house was restored in 1889 and once again from 1965 to 1970. It houses the museum for the Historic District. In a tradition dating back to its first use, it is also a venue for lectures and meetings, and mock trials have also been performed in the courtroom. = 1829 School House = School House on the village green, built from stone The school house was built in 1829 in the span of a few months. It had one room, which served for lessons in \\"grammar, spelling, arithmetic, history, geography, the Bible, and depending on the scholarship of the teacher, Latin and philosophy\\". A school library had books about history, travel, natural sciences, agriculture, biographies, and literature, listed in an 1843 directory. Sixty-two children were educated in 1842, but 27 of them were at school for four to five months only. When the school was too small for a growing population in 1912, the building was turned into a museum founded by the Bedford Agassiz Society in 1913. It has been run by the Bedford Historical Society since 1918. In 1970, the school became a special exhibit for historic education. = 1872 Presbyterian Church = Bedford Presbyterian Church Today's Presbyterian Church on the village green was built in 1872 as the fourth on the site. The first minister, Reverend Thomas Denham, settled in 1684, and a meeting house was built in 1689. When Bedford became part of New York, this house was transferred to Rye, New York. Bedford was part of the Anglican Church until the Revolution. A second meeting house was burned by the British in 1779. A third house was transferred to Westmoreland Sanctuary. The fourth church was built in 1872.

Emigration to the United States After spending the remainder of his time in Palestine in Bir Zeit, Khoury came to the United States at age 17 on a fine arts scholarship to Ohio Wesleyan University. There, he earned a Bachelor of Arts and completed his Master of Fine Arts at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Detroit. He married his wife, Suheila Ghannam, in 1967. Together, they had three sons.

Many of his writings, photos and other archival material are held at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. They form part of a historical collection on Arab, Muslim, and Assyrian Americans in Michigan. In 1987, Khoury was commissioned by the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (ACCESS) to paint a mural depicting Arab-American life, social, professional and cultural contributions to Michigan.

Harrington attended Marquette University and became the football team's captain in 1942. He joined the military in 1944 and played for Air Force teams in 1944 and 1945. He was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals in 1945 but instead signed with the Browns before the team's inaugural season in 1946. Harrington played in one season for the Browns before he was traded to the Rockets in 1947. Early life and college career Harrington was born and grew up in Reedsburg, Wisconsin and attended high school there. After graduating, he went to Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and played his first football game for the college team in 1941, when he was a sophomore. Harrington, who played as an end, had two touchdown catches in one of his first games against Kansas. In 1942, he was named the Marquette football team's captain. Harrington then entered the Second Air Force during World War II and was the captain of the unit's Superbombers football team, who played in the Treasury Bond Bowl in 1944. In 1945, Harrington played with the Fourth Air Force's football team, the Flyers. Professional career Harrington was drafted in the eighth round of the 1945 NFL Draft by the Chicago Cardinals, but did not play for the team. In March 1946, the Cleveland Browns of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) announced that they had signed Harrington. He reported to the team's training camp several days late to finish summer school studies at Marquette, to which he had returned after his discharge from the Army. Competition in training camp was intense, and Harrington was thought to have little chance of making the Browns' roster. His number was not listed in the program for the Browns' first game against the Miami Seahawks, but Harrington put in a solid defensive performance in the 44‚Äì0 victory, tackling Miami's backs for losses several times. The Browns won the AAFC championship that year. Before the 1947 season began, the Browns traded Harrington and Jim Daniell to the AAFC's Chicago Rockets for halfback Bill Boedeker.

This medal was created for those troops engaged in the Third Ashanti Expedition, also known as the War of the Golden Stool. This expedition lasted from March ‚Äì December 1900, with the final outcome that the Ashanti maintained its de facto independence. Ashanti was made a Protectorate of the British Empire, but they ruled themselves with little reference to the colonial power. Description The medal, designed by George William de Saulles, was circular and in diameter, with the following design: Obverse: The bust of King Edward VII in Field Marshal's uniform facing left with the inscription 'EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR'. Reverse: The British lion standing on a rocky cliff facing a rising sun with, below, a native shield and crossed spears with a scroll bearing the inscription 'ASHANTI'. Metal: Awarded in silver to combatants and in bronze for native carriers. Ribbon: Green, wide, with three black stripes, one at each edge and one in the centre. Naming: The rim of the medal was impressed with the recipient's name and unit in small square capitals. Officers' medals often had details engraved in script. Clasp The clasp 'KUMASSI' was awarded to the forces besieged within Kumassi between 31 March and 15 July 1900 and to members of the two relieving columns, under Colonel James Willcocks and Colonel A.P.

The series was played as a prelude for India's tour of South Africa, and included just one Test match and one One Day International (ODI). The tour began with a 50-over warm-up match, which the touring Indians won by 16 runs over the \\"Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI\\". Wisden Cricketers' Almanack criticised the \\"lifeless pitch\\" in the Test match, saying \\"both [bowling] attacks were rendered innocuous\\". Zimbabwe's captain, David Houghton top- scored for his side in their first innings, scoring the country's maiden Test century of 121. Zimbabwe established a 149-run first innings lead, but the match ended as a draw. By drawing the match, Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid defeat in their inaugural Test match since Australia won the very first Test match in 1877. In the solitary ODI, India won by 30 runs. Following the series, India travelled to South Africa, becoming the first team to tour the country for 23 years after an international boycott due to the country's apartheid policies, while Zimbabwe hosted New Zealand. Zimbabwe achieved their first victory in Test cricket the following summer, when they beat the touring Pakistan team. Tour matches =50 overs: Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI v Indians= The Indians were reduced to 76/5 after being put in to bat first, losing Mohammad Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar and Sanjay Manjrekar cheaply. Vice-captain Ravi Shastri then joined by Pravin Amre put together 47 runs for the sixth wicket helping their team go past 200. Shastri also shone with the ball returning figures of 2/21 in his ten overs restricting Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI 17 short of the target. For the latter, Gavin Briant remained unbeaten on 51. Test series =Only Test= This was the first Test match to have three appointed umpires. British company National Grid sponsored English umpire Dickie Bird so that he could fly to Zimbabwe for the match, the 48th Test match he had umpired. This equalled the world record for the most Test matches umpired. As a result, Bird umpired the whole match while the two Zimbabwean umpires present, Kantilal Kanjee and Ian Robinson, took to the field on alternate days. Because this was Zimbabwe's first ever Test match, ten of their eleven players were making their Test debut. The eleventh player, John Traicos, had previously played for South Africa before they were excluded from Test cricket in 1970. He was the 14th cricketer to play Test cricket for two different countries, and he broke the record for the longest period between Test appearances: 22 years and 222 days. Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat first, and India struggled to bowl for the first two days, lacking match practice and still adjusting to the altitude in Harare. Kevin Arnott and Grant Flower opened the batting for Zimbabwe with a 100-run partnership, though both batted cautiously and slowly. India took three wickets on the first day to leave Zimbabwe at 3/188 at stumps. A wicket fell early on the second day to bring David Houghton to the crease. Though Houghton, a mainstay in Zimbabwe's team, was known for aggressive batting, he curbed his instincts to score a slow maiden Test century. He reached his hundred after 305 minutes of batting, and he batted in total for 414 minutes, playing India's spin bowlers especially well. Houghton was the first player to score a century his country's inaugural Test match since Charles Bannerman did for Australia in 1877. Houghton and Andy Flower scored 165 runs in 68 overs for the sixth wicket, which took Zimbabwe to stumps on the second day, but all five remaining wickets fell quickly on the morning of the third day. Zimbabwe's first innings total was 456 all out, which easily beat 245 (scored by Australia in their first Test match) to become the highest ever score by a team in their inaugural Test match. The only fast bowler in Zimbabwe's team was Eddo Brandes, who opened the bowling when Zimbabwe took to the field, but broke down after two overs and didn't take any further part in the match. Regardless, Zimbabwe's other bowlers excelled, particularly John Traicos and Gary Crocker. Traicos dismissed Sachin Tendulkar caught and bowled for a duck then had India's captain Mohammad Azharuddin caught at slip for nine, while Crocker only conceded 11 runs in his first 13 overs, nine of which were maiden overs. India were reduced to 4/93 at stumps, still needing to score another 164 runs to avoid the follow-on. Traicos took three more wickets on day four to claim a five-wicket haul. He took five wickets for 86 runs in 50 overs, the best bowling figures of the match, but Zimbabwe lost the initiative when they decided to take a new ball, switching from Traicos to their seam bowlers. This change suited the Indian batsmen, Kapil Dev and Sanjay Manjrekar. Kapil Dev scored 60 runs and Manjrekar scored a century. Manjrekar's century was the fifth slowest Test century, and the slowest ever by an Indian batsman. It took him 500 minutes of batting, and he had faced 397 balls. Manjrekar reached his century just before stumps on the fourth day, and India finished the day with 7/278. Manjrekar was caught at backward point early on day five, and India were all out for 307 just 45 minutes later. As there was not enough time left for a result either, Zimbabwe slowly batted out a draw. In so doing, Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid losing their first Test match since Australia in 1876/77, when the first Test match was played. ODI series =Only ODI= The match was played in front of a crowd of 8,000, and Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to field. After India lost both of their opening batsmen with only one run scored, their innings was built around Sanjay Manjrekar, who top-scored for India with 70 runs. This lifted India to 239 all out. The Flower brothers (Andy and Grant) opened the batting for Zimbabwe and got them off to a good start, but after the middle order collapsed only Gary Crocker showed any resistance against the Indian bowlers. Zimbabwe were bowled out for 209 and lost by 30 runs.

Measuring just over one metre squared, the piece was created as part of Melanie Boda's degree course in Interactive ArtsInteractive Arts , Manchester Metropolitan University, UK. at Manchester Metropolitan University gaining her first class honours. Bog Standard Gallery was created to house photographs from Melanie Boda's 'Bog Standard Signs' series, a collection of photographs of toilet signs from around the world. The collection spans thousands of images of the symbols used to depict 'male' and 'female' on toilet doors from around the globe. The photograph collection began as part of Melanie Boda's research towards her dissertation in which she investigated whether cultural differences are portrayed in the design of toilet signs in different parts of the world. The original study was based on the toilet signs in the United Kingdom, as a comparison with the toilet signs in Israel. As Boda travelled further, and the collection of images grew, the research has developed. Melanie now receives images of toilet signs from people around the world who have since been interested in the project and want to make a contribution to the growing collection. Bog Standard Gallery exhibits 24 photographs from the collection at a time and the images are frequently changed to incorporate new signs added to the collection.

The motherhouse, the former convent at St. Gildard in Nevers, which is now a space for pilgrims to sleep and learn about Bernadette, and is called Espace Bernadette, is built on the ruins of the priory of Saint-Gildard, and was supervised by the bishop of the diocese of Nevers. History In 1678, Jean-Baptiste Delaveyne (1653‚Äì1719), a Benedictine who had spent seven years being dazzled by the court of Louis XIV of France, returned to Saint-Saulge, the hamlet in the Ni√®vre department where he was born, in an attempt to regain the spiritual direction of his youth. Struck by the poverty he found in that rural area, he offered the young ladies of the village of Saint-Saulge a challenge: \\"Have no other business but that of charity. Have no other interests but those of the unfortunate.\\" This challenge led to the congregation's foundation. Delaveyne organized a small house with Sisters who ministered to the sick and the poor. The congregation was housed in Ch√¢teau-Chinon in 1706. In 1710 they moved to Decize to serve in the local hospital, and in 1716 they consecrated a chapel in Saint-Saulge to the Immaculate Conception. In 1748 they returned to Ch√¢teau-Chinon, to its hospital. While the Sisters initially ministered to the poor, during the nineteenth century they were more oriented toward the middle classes (and most of the novices were middle-class girls), and by the 1860s operated 260 convents in France. In 1853, the Sisters were given the former Church of Saint Lupus and Saint Gildard in Nevers by Dominique-Augustin Duf√™tre, bishop of Nevers, to build a religious house; it was officially consecrated on 15 July 1856. Notable sisters Bernadette of Lourdes. The Catholic convent is best known for Bernadette Soubirous, also known as Saint Bernadette of Lourdes, a sister in the motherhouse at Nevers; after having received her visions, Bernadette entered the convent in Lourdes run by the sisters, who had opened a hospice in Lourdes in 1834. In 1866, she was accepted to take her novitiate in Nevers, where she died in 1879. Her body is enshrined in the St. Gildard Convent's chapel in Nevers. Today, the Sisters also tend the cachot, the basement apartment in Lourdes where Soubirous lived during her youth; in 2008, the Sisters received Pope Benedict XVI in the cachot, before he visited the grotto in Lourdes. Another notable Sister was Marcelline Pauper, born 1663, who entered at Nevers at age twenty-two. Her autobiography was published in 1871; in it, she described how she made reparations for a sacrilege that had occurred in the chapel by receiving the stigmata, on 26 April 1702.

(1676‚Äì1732) was an English jurist, expelled from the University of Oxford in a high-profile controversy. Early life Ayliffe was born at Pember, Hampshire, in 1676. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he matriculated February 1690, became B.A. 1699, M.A. 1703, LL.B. and LL.D. 1710. Up to 1710 he practised as a proctor in the chancellor's court. But his Whig political opinions stood in the way of advancement. Political troubles He was an ardent whig at a time when Oxford was the home of Tories and Jacobitism. In 1712, he issued a specimen of a work on Oxford for which he had collected materials while practising in the chancellor's court; but the scheme was received badly. The book was published, however, in 1714, about a week before Queen Anne's death. A few months later Ayliffe was summoned before the university court at the suits of Bernard Gardiner, then vice-chancellor, and of Thomas Braithwaite, the former vice- chancellor, for certain words reflecting on them. In the passage which gave offencei. 216 he had gone out of his way to say that the funds of the Clarendon Printing House had been misappropriated. The result was that Ayliffe was expelled from the university, and deprived of all privileges and degrees. He was attacked also by John Cobb, the Warden of New College for another passage,i. 322 where he remarked on the lack of distinction of the college's men. He was accused, moreover, of disobedience, and of having in a conversation with one Prince threatened to pistol the Warden. Rather than make submission he resigned his fellowship. The whole story is told in a pamphlet, called the Case of Dr. Ayliffe at Oxford; from internal evidence it is thought Ayliffe either wrote or inspired it. It claims that the real causes of the proceedings were his insinuation that the unwillingness of several colleges to give him an account of their benefactors' funds, his protest against the veto claimed by some heads of colleges, and his political opinions. Nicholas Amhurst described a public speech delivered just after George I's accession, in which Ayliffe was violently abused. Death He died 5 November 1732. Works Most of Ayliffe's Ancient and Present State of Oxford, which occasioned the attacks on him, is avowedly an abridgment and correction of Anthony Wood's History and Antiquities of Oxford. The work enters into legal details at length. Ayliffe's chief titles to fame are his two treatises on the canon law and the civil law. The Parergon Juris Canonici Anglicani appeared in 1726. In 1734 was published the first volume of a New Pandect of the Civil Law, which he had written some years before; there was at the time more interest in the civil law, and Ayliffe designed his book not only for the lawyer, but also for the politician and the diplomat. # 'The Ancient and Present State of the University of Oxford,' 2 vols, 1714, reprinted in 1723. The appendix contains a number of charters, decrees, &:c., relating both to Oxford and Cambridge. # 'The Case of Dr. Ayliffe at Oxford: giving, first, an Account of the Unjust and Malicious Prosecution of him in the Chancellor's Court of that University, for Writing and Publishing a Book, entituled the Antient and Present State of the University of Oxford: And secondly, an Account of the Proceedings had against him in his College, chiefly founded on the Prosecution of the University; whereby he was oblig'd to quit the one, and was expel'd the other,' 1716.

This was a publication by anticipation of Book IV.

The structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on March 10, 1983. It was built for and is currently occupied by the newspaper The Bakersfield Californian. Structure The Bakersfield Californian Building consists of two structures, both faced with reddish-brown bricks and with a primary facade facing east. Originally, the four-story main building was rectangular in shape, but over time additions made it L-shaped. A detached, rectangular structure, designed as a women's rest facility, is located at the northeast corner of the larger one. The fenestration of the primary structure is symmetrically laid out with steel sash windows on all four sides. Exterior brick pilasters on the secondary sides cover the structural steel. The main entry on the eastern facade consists of seven wide granite steps which lead to polished brass double glass doors. The entry is divided into three sections by columns, each features a large, rectangular opening. The two side sections hold large, multi-paned windows and heraldic shields above, one with the name of the architect. The center section, framed by Corinthian columns includes the main door along with a multi-paned transom; above the door is inscribed \\"Established 1866\\". The parapet above the sections is inscribed with \\"The Bakersfield Californian\\"; a later renovation placed a new inscription, using a new font, in front of the original inscription. The entire entrance facade is inset between two brick-faced towers with parapets; the towers have a set of twelve paned windows in the first floor and the same on the third. The southeast tower has wrought iron balustrades that round the corner, covering large French doors with white lintel and has a flag pole at the top. The northeast tower consists of two towers and is finished with a shorter ¬æ round turret topped with a terra cotta roof. Above the third-story windows on the eastern facade, and between the towers, is a course of small blind brick arches.Chris Brewer, Historic Resources Inventory, State of California -- The Resources Agency, Department of Parks and Recreation, April 9, 1984; copy accessed from City of Bakersfield Cultural Resources Survey Downtown Area, located in the Local History room of the Beale Memorial Library, Bakersfield, California. The second, smaller structure has similar features to the main building, and was specifically designed to accommodate women visiting downtown Bakersfield. The cultural norms of the era made it difficult for women to find public restrooms, and it was not appropriate to enter local buildings to use facilities.Amy Beaudreault, Speaker tells of women's rest facility, The Post, October 21, 1998, Accessed January 2, 2011. Significance As a newspaper, The Bakersfield Californian is a descendant of Kern County's first newspaper, the Havilah Courier (1866). Havilah was the first county seat before local government was moved to Bakersfield. Built in 1926, the building itself is considered an architectural landmark and a reminder of the golden years of the newspaper. The publisher at the time, Alfred Harrell, was an esteemed member of the community and from his tenure starting in 1897 to his death in 1946, built the newspaper's reputation as an institution committed to civic responsibility.

The trail types vary from natural surface singletrack to asphalt shared-use paths. In many cases, trail projects include on-road bike lanes and signed shared road routes.  Detroit Greenways Vision  The Detroit Greenways Coalition is a group of stakeholders and city officials that meets monthly and promotes greenway development within the city. This Coalition has developed a Detroit Greenway Vision which calls for over of greenways throughout Detroit. That vision also includes bike lanes to bridge gaps between the greenways and to connect with neighborhoods. These bike lanes are a subset of the over of bike lanes proposed within the Detroit Non-Motorized Transportation Master Plan. Major trails  = Conner Creek Greenway = The Conner Creek Greenway through the Conner Playfield Dequindre Trail and the Globe Building Southwest Detroit Greenway in Patton Park The Conner Creek Greenway is located on Detroit's east side. When completed, it will stretch from M-102 (8 Mile Road) south to the Detroit River, tracing the original Conner Creek. The greenway makes use of shared-use paths, bike lanes, and bike routes. It begins at Maheras Gentry Park (on the Detroit River), travels north past the Detroit City Airport, and up to Eight Mile Road. The Milbank Greenway is also considered part of the Conner Creek Greenway. The Milbank Greenway provides a short connection between Van Dyke Avenue and Conner Avenue just north of Outer Drive. The greenway uses an undeveloped road right-of-way and includes many gardens along its length. The bike lanes along Van Dyke Avenue between East Outer Drive and Eight Mile Road are part of the Conner Creek Greenway. Those bike lanes continue north into the city of Warren. This bicycling portion of the Iron Belle Trail also uses the Conner Creek Greenway starting on St. Jean north of Kercheval Avenue. = Corktown/Mexicantown Greenlink = The Corktown/Mexicantown Greenlink is a network of nearly of bike lanes and of signed sign roadways. This network is throughout Detroit's Corktown and Mexicantown neighborhoods. The Greenlink connects with the Southwest Detroit Greenway using W. Vernor Highway. While this project was originally conceived and planned through the Greater Corktown Development Corporation, it is now a product of the Southwest Detroit Business Association. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) added bike lanes to U.S. Highway 12 (US 12, Michigan Avenue) between Livernois and Rosa Parks Boulevard. Those were upgraded to protected bike lanes and extended to Cass Avenue. MDOT also built a pedestrian bridge over Interstate 75 (I-75) connecting Bagley Street. Though technically not part of the greenlink, the bike lanes and bridge provide additional connections to the greenlink network. = Dequindre Cut = The Dequindre Cut is a below-grade pathway located on the east side of Detroit just west of St. Aubin Street. The trail is currently completed between the Detroit River Walk/Milliken State Park (at Atwater Street), Eastern Market, and Mack Avenue. One highlight of this greenway is its colorful graffiti. = Detroit River Walk = The Detroit River Walk is a promenade along the Detroit International Riverfront running from the Ambassador Bridge to Belle Isle. of river walk are now completed. The river walk connects many parks, including Hart Plaza, Chene Park, Mt. Elliot Park, and the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor. This greenway provides views of Windsor, Ontario, as well as passing freighters. Pavilions, fishing piers and benches are located at intervals along the path. = Lyndon Avenue Greenway = The Lyndon Avenue Greenway is a route in Detroit's Brightmoor neighborhood and runs between Eliza Howell Park and Stoepel Park. Besides connecting the two large area parks, the greenway also includes many pocket parks. This segment of Lyndon Avenue will have bike lanes added once the greenway is completed. = Midtown Loop Greenway = The Midtown Loop will be a greenway trail that will follow existing street patterns, specifically following Kirby Street, John R Street, Canfield Street, and Cass Avenue with Warren Avenue serving as the central connector. The loop will be linked to greenway initiatives in surrounding areas, providing a key component of a larger greenway network linking Midtown to Eastern Market and the Dequindre Cut. The Loop will also connect the campuses of Wayne State University and the Detroit Medical Center. Phase 1 of the project is completed along Kirby and John R. It was funded through ARRA. Phase 2 will be along Canfield and Cass. Additional construction will connect the Midtown Loop to the Dequindre Cut. Significant public art is planned for the greenway. According to the University Cultural Center Association‚Äîthe organization responsible for the Loop, \\"the public art component will elevate this greenway to the level of becoming a tourist attraction.\\" Note that the Midtown Loop is designed primarily as a wide sidewalk and is therefore best suited for pedestrians or bicycling at modest speeds. Bicyclists traveling at higher speeds will likely prefer riding on the adjacent road. = Southwest Detroit Greenway = The Southwest Detroit Greenway stretches from the M-85 (Fort Street) bascule bridge (over the Rouge River, through the West Vernor Business District, to Clark Park. The greenway includes a shared-use path through Patton Park and a signed bike route to Dearborn's Lapeer Park, both of which are completed. This greenway connects with the Corktown/Mexicantown Greenlink on the east, the Detroit River Walk on the south, the Claytown-Michigan Avenue Greenway on the north, and the Downriver Delta Greenways on the west. A major portion of this greenway consists of the bike lanes along West Vernor Avenue. Streetscaping and wayfinding are planned for this West Vernor segment.  Trails within city parks  = Belle Isle = Nature trails are provided through the wet-mesic flatwoods on the island. These are enjoyed throughout the year. There are also bike lanes on the island's outer roads and on the MacArthur Bridge. = Lafayette Park and Elmwood trails = The Lafayette Park and Elmwood neighborhoods include internal public parks which have paved paths. These paths connect the residential areas with surrounding streets. = Palmer Park = Palmer Park has a paved shared-use path loop that begins at the pool area, goes through the center of the park, along 7 Mile Road and back along Merrill Plaisance. There are also unpaved foot trails through the forested areas which were recently reopened. = Rouge Park Trails = There are approximately of paved pathways through Rouge Park. In addition, the Michigan Mountain Biking Association and Student Conservation Association have developed a hiking/mountain bike singletrack trail.  Planned trail projects  = Downriver Delta Greenways = The Downriver Delta Greenways are conceptual non-motorized links within Detroit's 48217 communities. These links provide a key connection between the Southwest Detroit Greenway, the Rouge Gateway Project, and the Downriver Linked Greenway Initiative. = Belt Line Greenway = The Gleaners Food Bank is currently studying the feasibility of building a greenway along the abandoned rail corridor just east of Beaufait from the Detroit River to Gratiot Avenue. This greenway would connect the Detroit River Walk, Capuchin Soup Kitchen/Earthworks, and the Gleaners Food Bank. This project has also been called the Gleaners Greenway and Beaufait Greenway. = Joe Louis Greenway = The Joe Louis Greenway (formerly called the Inner Circle Greenway) is a planned loop that circles the city of Detroit while connecting Dearborn, Hamtramck, and Highland Park. The primary segment is a abandoned Conrail railroad corridor. The Joe Louis Greenway also uses other existing or planned greenways including the Dequindre Cut, Southwest Detroit Greenway, and Detroit River Walk.Detroit Greenways Coalition = Claytown- Michigan Avenue Greenway = Bridging Communities is currently leading efforts to develop a Claytown-Michigan Avenue Greenway Plan. This plan will provide the residents and stakeholders of Claytown community (north of Southwest Detroit) with a common design and future goal of improved beautification and non-motorized transportation. = New Center Greenway = The New Center Council has developed a non-motorized transportation plan for New Center which includes a proposed rail with trail. That trail, called the New Center Greenway would be approximately and would be located on unused portions of the railroad right-of-way running through the middle of New Center. = Villages GREEN Project = The Greater Riverfront Eastside Environmental Network (GREEN) is a non-motorized planning project led by the Villages Community Development Corporation. The GREEN project has identified a number of potential greenways which include shared-use paths and bicycle boulevards. The project also includes a proposed extension of Detroit River Walk. This extension heads upstream from Gabriel Richard Park to Detroit's eastern border at Alter Road.  Water trails  = Detroit Heritage River Water Trail = In September 2006, Metropolitan Affairs Coalition (MAC) released plans for the Detroit Heritage River Water Trail, the first water trail planned for Southeast Michigan and the only one developed along a river designated by both Canada and the United States as a Heritage River. The Detroit Heritage River Water Trail is a river version of a greenway trail (or ‚Äúblueway‚Äù) and will provide opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, and small boat paddling. Note that current city ordinances prohibit the launching of kayaks and canoes from Detroit city parks. The Michigan Trails and Greenways Alliance and Riverside Kayaks are working with the city to remove this restriction.

Biography William Ayloffe was descended from a very ancient family settled originally in Kent and subsequently in Essex, whose origin has been traced to Saxon times. Ayloffe's father, William Ayloffe of Hornchurch, Essex, married Anne Barnardiston, the daughter of Sir Thomas Barnardiston of Ketton, Suffolk. On 14 February 1553-4 Ayloffe was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn, where two other near relatives, bearing the same name, distinguished themselves in the sixteenth century, and in 1560 he was called to the bar. After being appointed \\"reader\\" at his inn of court in Lent term, 1571, he was made serjeant-at-law in 1577, at the same time as Sir Edmund Anderson, afterwards the well-known lord chief justice of the Common Pleas. A notice of a banquet in the Middle Temple hall, given by Ayloffe with other barristers upon whom a similar distinction had just been conferred, to celebrate their promotion, is preserved among the Ashmolean manuscripts at Oxford. Cites: Ashm. MS. 804, ii. 1 No record is known of Ayloffe's elevation to the bench, but he is found acting as judge in the court of Queen's Bench in 1579, Calendar of State Papers, 1547-1580, p. 637 and his judgments are reported by Dyer, Coke, and Savile after that date, which may therefore be regarded as the probable year of his appointment. He was present in 1581 at the trial of Edmund Campion and other seminary priests, and special attention is called to the part he played on that occasion in a pamphlet published by English Catholics at Pans shortly afterwards, and bearing the title , 12mo. On page 202 it is there stated, on the evidence of eyewitnesses, that while sitting in court after the other judges had retired, and while the jury were considering their verdict, Ayloffe took off his glove and found his hand and ring covered with blood without any apparent cause, and that, in spite of his endeavours to wipe it away, the blood continued to flow as a miraculous sign of the injustice that polluted the judgment-seat. Some letters that passed between Ayloffe and the lord mayor of London with reference to the appointment of his brother as town clerk, are preserved among the city archives for the years 1580 and 1581. Remembrancia, pp. 149, 150, 271 Ayloffe died on 8 November 1585. Marriages and issue Ayloffe married, about 1560, Jane Sulyard, the daughter of Sir Eustace Sulyard, by whom he had three sons and at least one daughter. In 1612 the baronetcy of Ayloffe was conferred by James I upon his eldest son, William (d.1627), who had been knighted in 1603. The baronetcy continued in the family till 1787.

The station replaced an earlier station on the original line of the railway that had been served by a stationary engine. It was open from 1885 until 1952 for passengers and 1965 for freight. History The Bolton and Leigh Railway (B&LR;) opened for goods traffic in 1828, followed by passenger services in 1831. The original railway included two inclines worked by stationary engines, one of which was situated north of Atherton Bag Lane railway station with the line climbing up through Chequerbent before dropping towards Bolton. The stationary engines played a prominent role on the line for at least 15 years and it is believed they remained in operation until about 1846. Cable haulage was discontinued once locomotive performance had improved sufficiently. The incline at Chequerbent was superseded by a deviation built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1885, the LNWR was by then the owner and operator of the line. At the same time the opportunity was taken to lay double track from Bag Lane through to Bolton. The route of the new line passed under the A6, whereas the previous line had crossed at road level, the station was sited in a cutting on the north side of the road-over bridge, complemented by a new Station Masters house and a number of railway cottages. The old track alignment continued in use from the north end to access Hulton Collieries. The station opened in 1885, replacing the earlier station which had opened in 1831. The new station was sometimes known as Chequerbent for Hulton Park. The station had two platforms reached via steps. The station had a goods yard situated to the north of the passenger station capable of handling \\"Live Stock, Horse Boxes and Prize Cattle Vans, and Carriages by Passenger Train\\". Freight traffic The 1885 deviation eased the gradients somewhat, but the climb northwards from Atherton Bag Lane to Chequerbent remained arduous, with a nominal gradient of 1 in 30.5 for 1.6 miles - appreciably steeper than the Lickey Incline. This gradient was, however, purely nominal, as over the years colliery subsidence resulted in a continuous climb with an uneven gradient, including a stretch at 1 in 18. This imposed severe restrictions on loads, locomotives and men and resulted in this relative backwater becoming a Mecca for cameramen and film makers as dense loads such as sand were carried well into the 1960s. Closures The station closed to passengers in 1952, though local passenger trains continued to pass through for two more years and excursion traffic for four years after that. It finally closed completely in 1965. The goods yard closed on 27 February 1965. The final closure of the line through Chequerbent was in January 1969 when the last remaining section of line between Howe Bridge Junction and Hulton Sidings was closed to Freight Traffic.

The building is the work of the Spanish architect Enric Sagnier and was completed by his son Josep Maria Sagnier i Vidal. The construction of the church, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, lasted from 1902 to 1961. History A model of the church The idea of building a Catholic church on the summit of the Mount Tibidabo emerged in the late 19th century amidst rumors about the construction of a Protestant church and a hotel-casino at that location. This motivated a \\"Board of Catholic Knights\\" to acquire the ownership of the field and give it to Saint John Bosco in 1886, when he was visiting Barcelona at the invitation of Dorotea de Chopitea, a great patron and promoter of the project. From this arose the idea of a building dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a dedication very popular at that time thanks to the impetus given by Pope Leo XIII, and following in line with the church built in Rome by Bosco himself (Sacro Cuore di Ges√π a Castro Pretorio) and the famous Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Paris. In 1886 a neo-Gothic hermitage was built, and two years later, for the Universal Exposition, the Vallvidrera road was urbanized and a pavilion of Mudejar inspiration was built beside the hermitage to serve as a viewing point (for the city below). However, the project to build the church suffered a significant delay mainly because of the development of a new project to build an astronomical observatory on the summit of Tibidabo, which was eventually constructed on a nearby hill (Fabra Observatory). Finally, on 28 December 1902, the first stone was placed in a ceremony presided by the Bishop of Barcelona, Salvador Casa√±as i Pag√®s. The crypt was built between 1903 and 1911, and the main church was built between 1915 and 1951. The church was consecrated by Bishop Gregorio Modrego Casaus during the 35th Eucharistic Congress held in Barcelona in 1952. The towers were completed afterward, with work officially ending in 1961. On 29 October 1961 the church received the title of minor basilica from Pope John XXIII. Exterior Facade of the crypt The external appearance of the church is of a Romanesque fortress of stone from Montju√Øc (the crypt), topped by a monumental neo-Gothic church accessed by two grand outdoor stairways. The upper church has a central floor with an octagonal dome on eight columns. The dome is crowned with an image of the Sacred Heart; the original work was by Frederic Mar√®s (destroyed in 1936) and replaced in 1950 with another by Josep Miret. The upper church is square with three apses, a large central tower, and four lower towers marking the four corners of the square, and statues of the Twelve Apostles sculpted by Josep Miret. The main facade has three sections, the central wider, chaired by the figure of the Archangel Michael in the arch of the main entrance, and John Bosco in the pediment above. Over the left door is the statue of Teresa of √Åvila and over the right, Marguerite Marie Alacoque. Above the door is an open gallery of arches with tracery. The fa√ßade of the crypt has a richly decorated tympanum with sculptures by Alfons Juyol i Bach following the design of Eusebi Arnau. The sculptures represent the Virgin of Mercy, Saint George, and Saint James, the patron saints of Barcelona, Catalonia, and Spain, respectively. The crypt facade consists of three semicircular arches on columns, inserted under a larger semicircular arch, originally decorated with a mosaic of the Holy Trinity by Daniel Zuloaga (destroyed in 1936). In 1955 it was redecorated by the Bru Workshop of Barcelona; the work depicts an allegory of the devotion of Spain, represented by its patron saints. Interior Inside the temple The interior is divided into a nave and two aisles with semicircular apses, with stained glasses and four rose windows on the facades. In the main altar stands the great crucifix, a work by Joan Puigdollers. The windows of the presbytery are dedicated to Pius X, John the Evangelist, Marguerite Marie Alacoque, Paul the Apostle and John Bosco. The left altar has five stained glasses dedicated to various Marian devotions: the Virgin of Antipolo (Philippines), Our Lady of Luj√°n (Argentina), the Assumption of Mary, Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico) and Our Lady of Charity (Cuba). The right altar is presided by the Risen Jesus, a work by Joan Puigdollers, and its stained glasses are dedicated to Spanish Marian devotions: the Virgin of Almudena (Madrid), the Virgin of N√∫ria (Catalonia), Our Lady of Hope, Our Lady of the Forsaken (Valencia) and Our Lady of Bego√±a (Basque Country). The windows of the four towers contain the Latin phrase tibi dabo (\\"I'll give you\\"), the name of the mountain. At the level of the choir include founding saints: Marcellin Champagnat and Jean-Baptiste de La Salle on both sides of the presbytery, and Anthony Mary Claret, Joseph Calasanctius, John Bosco and Maria Domenica Mazzarello next to the main facade. The windows of the four facades are dedicated to Francis de Sales, Pius XI, Ignatius of Loyola, Francisco Javier, Pius IX, Rose of Lima, Leo XIII and Pius XII. The eight stained glasses of the dome depict scenes from the life of Jesus. Statue of Jesus Statue of Jesus on the top of Sagrat Cor. The church is crowned by the enormous bronze statue of the Sacred Heart made by Josep Miret in 1950. It replaced the original by Frederic Mar√®s, which was made in 1935 and destroyed the following year as the Spanish Civil War began. The ascent from the crypt, passing through the church and ending at the sculpture, reflects the rise and the purification of the human condition by means of sacrifice and atonement. Crypt The crypt was designed in a neo-Byzantine style, combining Gothic and classical elements, and decoration close to Modernisme. The space of the crypt consists of five naves separated by columns, the central one being wider, all with semicircular apses. The walls and vaults are lined with alabaster or decorated with mosaics, with scenes relating to the dedications of the altars: Mary Help of Christians, Saint Anthony of Padua, the Blessed Sacrament, Saint Joseph, and the Virgin of Montserrat. Inside the crypt Polychrome alabaster is also used for the Via Crucis (Stations of the Cross) sculpted by Josep Miret. The windows that bring natural light inside are complemented by stained glass windows with the following topics: the largest in the arch, in the corners, represent the appearance of the Our Lady of the Pillar and the conversion of King Reccared I to Catholicism; Saint Ferdinand and Saint Hermenegild are represented in the two large vertical windows; and the small ones located above the door are dedicated to Joachim, Isidore the Farmer, Saint Anthony and Saint Elizabeth of Portugal. From the crypt there is access to a chapel dedicated to the Perpetual Adoration, excavated into the mountain in the late 1940s, consisting of three naves divided by columns. The interior is decorated with marble, mosaics in the pavement, and paintings by Miquel Farr√© i Albag√©s in the vaults, made between 1947-1949. Outside of the crypt, on either side of the main door, are two staircases leading to the level of the temple itself.

Early life Ayrton was the younger son of Dr. Edmund Ayrton, and was born in London. The Ayrton family originated in Yorkshire and William's grandfather Edward Ayrton was mayor of Ripon in 1760, laying the foundations for the family's subsequent prominence. Career ;Impresario: In 1816, Ayrton travelled to the Continent, to engage singers for the Italian opera at the King's Theatre. The following year he directed the productions, staging the first-ever performance of Mozart's Don Giovanni in England, and also introducing English audiences to such great artists as: Giuditta Pasta, Violante Camporese, Gaetano Crivelli and Giuseppe Ambrogietti. In spite of a successful season, Ayrton was obliged to retire from the direction, due to various disputes within the company. In 1821, under the management of John Ebers, Ayrton again took the post of musical director but, owing to opposition he encountered from the committee, he was again forced to resign. ;Writer: For the rest of his life, Ayrton concentrated on writing. From 1823 to 1833 he edited and contributed largely to the periodical the Harmonicon.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZJlrCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA202&lpg;=PA202&dq;=morning+chronicle+william+ayrton&source;=bl&ots;=AIFaMqfBSv&sig;=ACfU3U0z_AalH8paQ4INtb_I6dT9-th1QA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj3jZmd9IPmAhVRZ8AKHcNyC8kQ6AEwAnoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q;=morning%20chronicle%20william%20ayrton&f;=false In 1834-1835 he published his Sacred Minstrelsy, and in 1834, 1835 and 1836 the work now known as the Musical Library: an early affordable collection of vocal and instrumental music. ;Interests: Ayrton was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and one of the original members of both the Royal Institution and the Athen√¶um Club. ;Legacy: The personal papers and correspondence of William Ayrton can now be found in the British Library.http://www.cecilia-uk.org/html/search/verb/GetRecord/481 His son William Scrope Ayrton (1804-1885) annotated the material, with the collection eventually partly sold at auction and partly donated to the British Library by his great-granddaughter Phyllis Alsager Ayrton.http://www.cecilia- uk.org/html/search/verb/GetRecord/481/ Later life William Ayrton married Marianne (Arnold), the daughter of the composer Samuel Arnold, on 17 May 1803. Their only son was also named William. Ayrton died at Bridge Street, Westminster, on 8 March 1858, and is buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Descendants William Scrope Ayrton (senior) (1804-1885) was William's son, a barrister of Middle Temple. He was an official on the Courts of Bankruptcy of Leeds and of London, but also wrote several textbooks on bankruptcy law.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Men-at-the- Bar/Ayrton,_William_Scrope In addition, he served as a magistrate in Yorkshire. In 1847 he married Margaret (Alsager), a daughter of Thomas Alsager.https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/small-stories-bigger-histories/dolls-house- indenture/ William Scrope Ayrton (junior) (1849-1904) was William's grandson, an official with HM.Consular Service.

Early posts included: Newchang (Yingkou), in 1881; Wuhu, in 1882; Hangkow (Wuhan), in 1885-1887.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_rFKDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA142&lpg;=PA142&dq;=consular+service+william+scrope+ayrton&source;=bl&ots;=oakj6_O7E5&sig;=ACfU3U2yWVkQa4W6X2Kb3mB6d7k4_LiMXA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiuhrT9l4bmAhWIFMAKHWbjDu8Q6AEwBnoECAcQAg#v=onepage&q;=consular%20service%20william%20scrope%20ayrton&f;=false From 1892-1896 he was HM.Consul, Tamsui, on the island of Formosa.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6cUMAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA535&lpg;=PA535&dq;=chinese+maritime+customs+service+william+ayrton&source;=bl&ots;=XiEiWyg6UW&sig;=ACfU3U1uWtE8X-OjqBqsh- YNtt-5jH1oYQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwibnNqzlIbmAhUMesAKHebvA0sQ6AEwA3oECAoQAg#v=onepage&q;=chinese%20maritime%20customs%20service%20william%20ayrton&f;=false This became a significant appointment when the First Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894 and Japan acquired the island in 1895. In 1896 Ayrton was posted as HM.Consul, Wenchow (Wenzhou). Ayrton married Ellen Louisa (McClatchie), sister of a fellow consular-officer, Thomas Russell Hillier McClatchie (d.1886); both were the children of the Rev. Thomas McClatchie, DD, MA, of the CMS in Shanghai. Edward Ayrton (1882-1914) was William's great-grandson, a leading archaeologist. Phyllis Ayrton (1884-1975) was William's great- granddaughter, a women's suffragist. She was a prominent Suffragette - though no direct relation of fellow-Suffragette Barbara Ayrton - having joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1909.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&pg;=PA23&lpg;=PA23&dq;=phyllis+alsager+ayrton&source;=bl&ots;=aOcYp3yhov&sig;=ACfU3U35DXO8giHt1hlwIII8SPX4jMneMQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi7hevHh4TmAhXNX8AKHfGvAuAQ6AEwAnoECAoQAg#v=onepage&q;=phyllis%20alsager%20ayrton&f;=false She was also a supporter of the Women's Party and campaigned in Smethwick, alongside the leading WSPU figure Flora Drummond, on behalf of Christabel Pankhurst in the 1918 Election, the first in which women could stand as candidates, or even vote.https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-flora-drummond-the- general-amp-phyllis-ayrton-campaigning-for-christabel-105355921.html Earlier, Drummond and Ayrton had also trailed the Prime Minister on a visit to women workers in Manchester.https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-david-lloyd-george- accompanied-by-flora-drummond-and-phyllis- ayrton-105348112.htmlhttps://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-in-manchester-flora- drummond-and-phyllis-ayrton-greet-prime-minister-105348108.html Ayrton also escorted the Australian Premier when he also visited women war workers.https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-the-australian-premier-william- hughes-reviews-female-munitions-workers-105355459.html Following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Ayrton went back to the Far East to help the 'refugees' (in modern parlance: Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)). She was thus, rather remarkably for an Englishwoman, present in both Sino- Japanese Wars. She was in Hong Kong when the Japanese launched their series of attacks on 8 (or 7, East of the date-line) December, 1941 and spent nearly four years in captivity, in Stanley Internment Camp. Despite the ordeal, she survived to live into her nineties.

The NAT64 gateway is a translator between IPv4 and IPv6 protocols,RFC 6052, IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators, IETF Standards Track, C.Bao et al. (October 2010) for which function it needs at least one IPv4 address and an IPv6 network segment comprising a 32-bit address space. The \\"well-known prefix\\" reserved for this service is 64:ff9b::/96. An IPv6 client embeds the IPv4 address it wishes to communicate with using the host part of the IPv6 network segment, resulting in an IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses (hence the 32-bit address space in the IPv6 network segment), and sends packets to the resulting address. The NAT64 gateway creates a mapping between the IPv6 and the IPv4 addresses, which may be manually configured or determined automatically.RFC 6146 Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers Principle of operation NAT64 and DNS64 A simple NAT64 installation may consist of a gateway with two interfaces connected to an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network, respectively. Traffic from the IPv6 network is routed via the gateway which performs all the necessary translations for transferring packets between the two networks. However, the translation is not symmetric, as the IPv6 address space is much larger than the IPv4 address space; thus, one-to-one address mapping is not possible. The gateway maintains IPv6-to-IPv4 address mapping, which may be established with an automatic algorithm (stateless mapping) or with special and manual translations (stateful mapping) when the first packet from the IPv6 network reaches the NAT64 gateway. Stateless translation is appropriate when a NAT64 translator is used in front of IPv4-only servers to allow them to be reached by remote IPv6-only clients. Stateful translation is suitable for deployment at the client side or at the service provider, allowing IPv6-only client hosts to reach remote IPv4-only nodes. In general, NAT64 is designed to be used when the communication is initiated by IPv6 hosts. Some mechanisms, including static address mapping, exist to allow the inverse scenario. Not every type of resource is accessible with NAT64. Protocols that embed IPv4 literal addresses, such as SIP and SDP, FTP, WebSocket, Skype, MSN, and any other content with IPv4 literals are excluded, but a dual-stacked web proxy allows IPv6-only clients to access even web pages with IPv4 literals in URLs. However, 464XLAT (described in RFC 6877), which uses NAT64, allows use of such protocols over IPv6-only connections. For SIP and FTP, the problem can also be solved using an application-level gateway, or using Port Control Protocol with the PREFIX64 extension specified in RFC 7225.

He was a close friend and associate of Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel. He was born in the municipality of La Uni√≥n, Guerrero in southern Mexico. When Rosales Mendoza founded the first cells of La Familia Michoacana in the 1980s, the Milenio Cartel was competing with the organization for the control of the production and distribution of narcotics in the state of Michoac√°n. In 2000, Rosales Mendoza united with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas to thwart the Milenio Cartel, causing a wave of violence in western Mexico that lasted until the year 2003. He was arrested twice, on 24 October 2004, and on 5 August 2014, and set free in late 2014. He was found dead in a parking lot on 28 December 2015. Criminal career Reports suggest that Rosales Mendoza's organization can be traced back to the 1980s and that was possibly a vigilante group to counter corruption and local crime, but the organization eventually became involved in the production and distribution of narcotics throughout the Mexican state of Michoac√°n. In the year 2000, Rosales Mendoza broke relations with Armando Valencia Cornelio of the Milenio Cartel and founded his own organization in Michoacan called La Empresa ('The Business'), a criminal organization that was the direct predecessor of La Familia Michoacana, some sources state that La Empresa and La Familia Michoacana are essentially the same thing, mainly because they share the same members but not the same allies. He also formed an alliance with Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, then leader of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, and merged with his organization. This alliance was intended to displace the Milenio Cartel from Michoac√°n state, and provoked a series of assassinations in the area until 2003. With the alliance, Rosales Mendoza became a Gulf Cartel operator and C√°rdenas Guill√©n dispatched two lieutenants of Los Zetas, Efra√≠n Teodoro Torres (Z-14) and Gustavo Gonz√°lez Castro (The Erotic One), to help him to train his men and protect the drug trafficking corridors in Guerrero and in the port city of L√°zaro C√°rdenas. He soon gained the trust of C√°rdenas Guill√©n and became one of the leading lieutenants for the Gulf Cartel in western Mexico, where he commanded a training camp and taught over 50 gunmen military tactics in order to carry out a prisons break to free C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who had been captured and imprisoned in 2003. In 2004, he organised the armed assault on a maximum security prison. His men managed to free 25 inmates, but Rosales Mendoza was arrested on suspicion of masterminding the jailbreak and spent the next decade in prison. After Rosales' arrest in 2004, Nazario Moreno Gonz√°lez seized control of the gang and in 2006 severed ties with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in an effort to take control of Michoac√°n from any external influences, marking the birth of an independent La Familia Cartel and starting a turf war against their former allies. Arrests While preparing to liberate Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n from prison, a squadron of about 150 soldiers in the Grupo Aerom√≥vil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE), the special forces unit of the Mexican Army, arrested Rosales Mendoza in the capital city of Morelia, Michoac√°n on 24 October 2004. Upon his arrest, Rosales Mendoza was taken into custody to Mexico City and kept in La Palma prison until he was taken to Puente Grande, a maximum security prison in the western state of Jalisco, on 28 October 2004 for 10 years. His capture resulted in new organizational leaders: Jos√© de Jes√∫s M√©ndez Vargas and Nazario Moreno Gonz√°lez. On 22 May 2014, Rosales Mendoza was released from prison in Jalisco after fulfilling his ten-year sentence for illegal possession of firearms, organized crime, and drug trafficking. On 5 August 2014, he was arrested again by state authorities at a restaurant in Morelia, Michoac√°n, but was released shortly after without charges. Kingpin Act sanction On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Rosales Mendoza under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. Carlos Rosales Mendoza was listed in the DEA's \\"most wanted\\" list. Death Rosales Mendoza was found dead on December 28, 2015 in a car park in Gabriel Zamora, Michoac√°n along with three other bodies. All four bodies showed signs of having been tortured. Authorities suspect Ignacio Andrade Renter√≠a (El Cenizo), a former mob lieutenant who now runs the Knights Templar Cartel.

USA Today. August 19, 2011 While it has been lauded by publications such as Time, Elle, Salon, NPR and reviewers for the beauty of its visual design and epic setting, it has also been criticized for misrepresenting various elements such as sexuality and its depiction of Arabic culture. Publication history Thompson began working on Habibi at the end of 2004 due to the widespread attention given towards the Middle East by the American society after the 9/11 attacks.

New York Magazine. August 21, 2011 in contrast to their vilification after the events of 9/11.Kross, Karen L. Bookslut \\"An Interview with Craig Thompson\\". Book Slut. February 2004 In the course of producing the story, Thompson was inspired by Arabic calligraphy, interpreting that form of writing as cursive shorthand for an idea, which Thompson says, is the \\"origin of cartooning\\". After having worked on the piece for nearly 6 years , Thompson finally published the work in 2011 under Pantheon Books. The graphic novel has been produced in both paperback and hardcover editions since its initial publication. Plot Summary Habibi takes place in the present day, albeit in a fictional \\"Orientalist landscape\\" named Wanatolia. The story begins with Dodola, a nine-year old girl who is sold into marriage by her poverty-stricken parents. Her husband rapes her on their wedding night. He teaches her how to read and write, which allows Dodola to understand and find appreciation for the Qur'an. However, one day, their home is broken into by thieves who murder Dodola's husband and kidnap her to be sold as a slave. During this captured period, Dodola witnesses the thieves preparing to kill a young boy - who she saves by claiming him to be her brother despite their evident ethnic differences. This child is the character known to be Zam. Prior to being sold into the slave market, Dodola and Zam escape from their captors and find refuge within an abandoned boat in the desert. However, in order to survive and earn money towards food and clothing, Dodola scavenges the desert and prostitutes herself to passing travelers, which eventually earns her the title of ‚Äúphantom courtesan of the desert‚Äù. As Zam grows older, he becomes increasingly reluctant to stay hidden within the boat until one day he decides to follow Dodola. Zam witnesses Dodola being raped by a passing traveler and Zam is beset by guilt. In an attempt to contribute, Zam goes off to search for water at a reservoir. Dodola, however, is found alone in the boat by a group of men who kidnap her for the Sultan of Wanatolia's harem. The Sultan, aware of her reputation and allure, makes a deal with Dodola claiming that he would grant her one wish if she is able to please him for seventy nights - otherwise, he would execute her. Dodola takes upon the conditions of the agreement and is bound to sexual servitude for seventy nights. However, on the very last night, the Sultan claims that he is not pleased by her and imprisons Dodola. Throughout this episode, Zam is stuck in desert and is confronted with starvation and thirst. In an attempt to retrieve some water, Zam journeys back to the reservoir where he is assaulted by the tradesmen. Zam befriends a eunuch in the nearby village and begins to undertake random tasks and jobs in order to survive. He eventually becomes a eunuch for the Sultan's court where he is finally reunited with Dodola. They escape from the Sultan's palace and attempt to find another place for refuge. Zam and Dodola come across their abandoned boat in a garbage dump. Rather than live in the garbage dump, they decide to move to another place upon seeing the impoverished conditions of the individuals scavenging the garbage dump for survival. They sneak onto a garbage truck, which takes them into the city of Wanatolia - an area that is extremely developed and filled with high-rise buildings. They feign being a married couple and Zam finds work within the city as a factory worker. Despite their ameliorated condition, Zam's conscious is disturbed by Dodola's previous treatment and his status as a eunuch to the point where he contemplates suicide. The novel concludes with Dodola and Zam saving and adopted a slave girl to prevent her from being subject to the same fate as Dodola and with them making plans to move out of the city.  Genre  Habibi is considered by scholars and other literary experts as a graphic novel, which falls under the greater umbrella of the comics form. A key differentiating factor for this particular type of literature is the employment of braiding - essentially the function of making connections across the multiframe. It is primarily focused on the relationship of the visual composition within a panel to others on a page and other panels scattered throughout the broader work, such as thematic elements and their significance in reference to their positioning within the graphic novel. Habibi has also been considered as a satire due its emphasis of Islamic influence that is countered by the advent of castration as a means of expressing the \\"impossibility and undesirability of living as a heterosexual, reproductive male\\". Yet, Habibi is most typified by the dramatic elements within its panels that lead many scholars to characterize this graphic novel as being part of a Drama-Romance genre. Reception Craig Thompson sketches Dodola in a copy of the book during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan, on September 20, 2011, its release date. Douglas Wolk of Time magazine called the book \\"as grand and sustained a performance as any cartoonist has published... and that every mark on the page can be a prayer\\".Wolk, Douglas. \\"The Line of Beauty: Habibi a graphic novel worthy of Scheherazade\\".

Graphic Novel Reporter. August 25, 2011 Michel Faber of The Guardian praised Habibi as \\"an orgy of art for its own sake\\", and calling Thompson an \\"obsessive sketcher\\" whose artwork he categorized with that of Joe Sacco and Will Eisner. Although Faber lauded the book's visuals and its message, he found both its length wearisome and its treatment of sex to be problematic, in particular the repeatedly sexual cruelty visited upon Dodola, which Faber felt caused the story to fold in on itself.Faber, Michel. \\"Habibi by Craig Thompson ‚Äì review\\". The Guardian. September 16, 2011 Natalie du P.C. Panno, writing for The Harvard Crimson, called Habibi \\"exquisite\\", seeing Thompson's use of Arabic calligraphy and geometric designs as a third dimension that, when added to the familiar graphic novel languages of image and text, broadened the possibilities for expression, perhaps more so for readers who do not know what it means, and must be guided in its interpretation. du P.C. Panno also praised the sensitivity with which Thompson executed his portrayal of Orientalist tropes, particular by the end of the book. Charles Hatfield of The Comics Journal conducted a round table discussion of the book featuring himself, Hayley Campbell, Chris Mautner, Tom Hart, Katie Haegele, and Joe McCulloch. Most of the panelists applauded Thompson's visual storytelling, calling it \\"gorgeous\\", \\"mind-altering\\", \\"lavish\\", and singling out elements such as Thompson's use of false light, and the \\"poignant\\" image of the wooden ship in the desert. More than one panelist compared Thompson's artwork positively to that of Will Eisner, in particular the fisherman from the story's final act. Also praised were the use of Arabic calligraphy and numerology, the intertwining of Biblical and Koranic vignettes as subplots with the main story, the scripting of Dodola's challenge to \\"turn water into gold\\", and the parallels between motifs such as chapter numbers and their content, and between the river and blood. Hatfield thought that the book's range of themes, from environmentalism to anti-Islamophobia, to thinly- veiled allegories about water rights, racism, pollution, slavery and rape made the book \\"way too big for elegance\\". By contrast, Mautner in particular thought Habibi was a smoother read than Blankets, which he felt featured too many subplots. Hart and McCullough agreed that Thompson's tendency to delineate every little detail which such obviousness left little to the reader's imagination or interpretation. The most recurrent complaint was with the book's bleak outlook on life and humanity, and the sexual cruelties inflicted upon the characters, which some of the reviewers thought was excessive, in particular Hatfield and Haegele, who felt that Thompson was condemning such atrocities while simultaneously luxuriating in them. Haegele did not care for the depiction of black characters in the book, finding them comparable to racial caricatures, and calling them \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"disgusting\\", and pointed to the \\"cornball\\" humor in these scenes in particular, and throughout the book in general. Both Hart and Haegele also pointed to Hyacinth's use of black American vernacular as implausible. Campbell partially disagreed, saying that much of the humor was carefully used to defuse scenes of tension, singling out the flatulent palace dwarf and the fisherman, which others mentioned they enjoyed as well.Hatfield, Charles. \\"A Habibi Roundtable\\". The Comics Journal. October 27, 2011 Robyn Creswell of The New York Times called the book \\"a mess\\", and \\"a work of fantasy about being ashamed of one's fantasies\\", an anxiety that he attributed to American comics produced by white males in general, pointing to elements in Habibi that recall the work of R. Crumb in particular. Echoing some of the Comics Journal roundtable's complaints, Creswell took fault with the book's depictions of racism and sexism, and its apparent exotification of the Muslim world without differentiating between fact and fantasy, saying, \\"It‚Äôs often hard to tell whether Thompson is making fun of Orientalism or indulging in it...Thompson the illustrator is...apparently unable to think of Dodola without disrobing her...it is a conventional sort of virtuosity, in the service of a conventional exoticism.\\"Creswell, Robyn. \\"The Graphic Novel as Orientalist Mash-Up\\". The New York Times. October 14, 2011 Nadim Damluji of The Hooded Utilitarian called the book \\"an imperfect attempt to humanize Arabs for an American audience\\", taking issue with Thompson's ignorance of the Arabic language, his depiction of Arab culture as \\"cultural appropriation\\", and the revelation in the later chapters of a modern, Westernized city in proximity to a primitive harem palace typified by sexual slavery. Though Damluji expressed awe of Thompson's technical skill, and found his artwork \\"stunning\\" and his ideas derived from his research \\"fascinating\\", he observed that Dodola and Zam arrive are given depth by contrasting them against \\"a cast of extremely dehumanized Arabs\\", and summarized the work thus: \\"Habibi is a success on many levels, but it also contains elements that are strikingly problematic...The artistic playground [Thompson] chose of barbaric Arabs devoid of history but not savagery is a well-trod environment in Western literature....The problem in making something knowingly racist is that the final product can still be read as racist.\\"Damluji, Nadim. \\"Can the Subaltern Draw?: The Spectre of Orientalism in Craig Thompson‚Äôs Habibi\\".

(died 1764) was an English physician. Life Avery was originally a Presbyterian minister at Bartholomew Close, London, but quit the ministry in 1720, in consequence of the Salters' Hall controversy on subscription, 1719. He practised as a physician, and was the Treasurer of Guy's Hospital. He retained the confidence of his Presbyterian brethren, and acted for 27 years as secretary to the Deputies of the Three Denominations of Dissenters, organised for the protection of the rights and redress of the grievances of the three denominations. He was a trustee of Dr. Williams's Library, 1728‚Äì64, and his portrait hangs in the library. He died 23 July 1764. Works He showed himself a political and theological liberal in contributing to the Occasional Papers, collected in three volumes, 1716‚Äì19, sometimes called the 'Bagweell' papers.An acronym formed by the initials of their authors' surnames, i.e. Simon Browne, Avery, Benjamin Grosvenor, Samuel Wright, John Evans, Jabez Earle, Moses Lowman, Nathaniel Lardner; see Monthly Repository, 1813, p. 443. Lowndes, under Occasional Papers, erroneously gives Barnes for Browne, Eames for Earle, and omits Lardner. These are not to be confused with the 'Occasional Paper,' 1697-8, by Bishop Willis. Avery also conducted the Old Whig, or Consistent Protestant, a weekly publication, 13 March 1735 to 13 March 1738, his chief coadjutors being George Benson, Samuel Chandler, Benjamin Grosvenor, Caleb Fleming, J. Foster, and Micaiah Towgood; the collected issue, in two volumes, 1739, is not complete. In 1728 Avery edited James Peirce's posthumous sermons and Scripture Catechism; he was probably the author of the Latin inscription prepared for Peirce's tomb.

Harvey is George Edwin Burnell Professor of Religious Studies (Emeritus) at Stanford University. Born in Hankow, China, he served in the U.S. Navy (1943‚Äì46), and was awarded a BA in Philosophy from Occidental College (1948, Phi Beta Kappa). After attending Princeton Theological Seminary for one year, he received a B.D. from Yale Divinity School in 1951 and a PhD. from Yale University in 1957 in post-Enlightenment religious thought. His thesis was entitled \\"Myth, Faith, and History\\" and his thesis supervisor was H. Richard Niebuhr. Van Harvey taught at Princeton University (1954‚Äì58), Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University (1958‚Äì68), the University of Pennsylvania (1968‚Äì78), and Stanford University (1978‚Äì1996). He was Chair of the graduate program in religion at SMU and Chair of his departments at both the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford. The aim of his first book A Handbook of Theological Terms (1964) was to explain to laypersons the meaning of technical terms found in Christian theology, with special attention to issues dividing Protestant and Catholic theology. His second book The Historian and the Believer (1966) was concerned with the way in which \\"morality of knowledge\\" that informs professional historical inquiry poses problems for the believer and theologian who attempt to justify the historical claims of Christianity ‚Äúon faith‚Äù, especially when historical inquiry is concerned with Jesus of Nazareth. Harvey argues that these problems have not been satisfactorily dealt with by modern Christian theologians. He pays particular attention to the theologies of Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, and Rudolf Bultmann. New Testament scholar Gerd L√ºdemann states in a citation of this book that \\"I have long been more indebted to this than is evident from the number of explicit references\\" The third edition of 1996 contains a new introduction outlining his mature position on these issues. One commentator has characterized Harvey's career after 1980 as having been transformed from theologian into skeptical student of religion. This change is reflected in both his articles and preeminently in his third book Feuerbach and the Interpretation of Religion (1995), winner of the 1996 American Academy of Religion‚Äôs award for excellence in constructive-reflective studies. This book argues that the neglected later writings of Ludwig Feuerbach dropped much of the Hegelian elements informing his better-known early work and created a more powerful theory for the origins and persistence of religion. Harvey compares this theory with several well-known contemporary social-scientific and psychological theories and judges Feuerbach's to be superior. Harvey has been awarded an honorary degree in the Humanities from Occidental College, two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships (1966 and 1972), a National Endowment of the Humanities Fellowship (1979), a Visiting Fellowship from Clare Hall, Cambridge University (1979), and distinguished teaching awards from both the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford University. He has contributed to several encyclopedias and reference works including the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

He was a professor of ancient history at the University of Bucharest, author of Marele Dic»õionar Geografic al Rom√¢niei (The Great Geographical Dictionary of Romania), general secretary of the Romanian Ministry of Teaching and multiple times senator, with conservative political views. Tocilescu is one of the first Romanian historians who focused on the study of civilizations in ancient Dacia. As a folklorist he collaborated on the publication of a folkloristics compendium.  Life  = Education = After finishing the primary and secondary school Ploie≈üti, Tocilescu went to Bucharest where he graduated at the Saint Sava National College. He then studied in universities in Prague and Vienna, where he obtained the Doctor of Philosophy title and the license to practice law. Back in Romania, in 1881 he became professor of ancient history and epigraphy at the University of Bucharest. = Involvement = In 1884 the Archaeological Seminary's Library was established through Professor Tocilescu's grant. At the death of Romanian historian, Romantic author, academic and politician Vasile Alexandrescu Urechia, November 21, 1901, Tocilescu delivered the funeral oration.  Professional activity  Grigore Tocilescu - caricature by Nicolae Petrescu GƒÉinƒÉ In 1877 Tocilescu went to Moscow, to the Rumyantsev Museum, where he copied the book From the Beginning of the First World (De-nceputul lumiei de-nt√¢iu), written by Mihail Moxa, and sent the copy to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who published it in Cuvente den batr√¢ni ( vol. I, 1878). The work is a universal history that begins with the \\"creation of the world\\", speaks of the Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, then passes to the Romans. It makes a brief history of the Roman Republic, after which it lists the emperors of the West and the East until the establishment of the Turkish rule in Europe and ends with the first battles of the Turks with the Romanians in 1489. Later, he left for Paris to continue his studies in the French archives and libraries, about Dimitrie Cantemir. On this occasion he attended courses at the Coll√®ge de France and the √âcole Pratique de Hautes-Etudes (Sorbonne). Returning to the country, he was appointed the director of the National Museum of Antiquities and held the position of professor of ancient history and epigraphy at the University of Bucharest (1881). From the point of view of archaeology, Tocilescu was the initiator of the Romanian archaeological excavations in Dobrogea. He is co-author of the work The Great Geographical Dictionary of Romania published in 5 volumes in Bucharest between 1898-1902. He was general secretary at the Ministry of Education and, several times, conservative senator. Tocilescu is one of the first historians to study the civilizations on the territory of the former Dacia. He left three impressive works: Dacia before the Romans (Dacia √Ænainte de romani), the Adamclisi Monument (Monumentul de la Adamclisi) in collaboration with O. Benndorf and G. Niemann and Fouilles et recherches arch√©ologiques en Roumanie. He was also concerned with the republishing of some fundamental works, such as The Chronicle of the Antiquity of the Romanian-Moldavian-Vlachs (Hronicul vechimei a rom√¢no-moldo-vlahilor) (Ed. Academiei, 1901) by Dimitrie Cantemir.

He composed it for the first Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it in Leipzig on 9 January 1724.  History and words  Bach performed the cantata in 1724, his first year in Leipzig on the First Sunday after Epiphany. The musicologist Alfred D√ºrr assumes that it was written already in Weimar, whereas John Eliot Gardiner shares this view only for movements 1, 4 and 7. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans, speaking of the duties of a Christian (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the finding in the Temple (). The unknown poet takes the parents' search for the lost Jesus as the starting point to depict the general situation of man who lost Jesus. Movements 1 and 2 lament this loss. Movement 3 is a chorale, stanza 2 of \\"\\" by Martin Janus (or Jahn), asking Jesus to return. Movement 4 asks the same question in a personal aria. The answer is given by the bass, the (voice of Christ), in the words of the Gospel \\"\\" (Do you not know that I must be in that which is My Father's? ). The joy of the finding is expressed paraphrasing from the Song of Songs \\"The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills\\"(). The cantata ends with stanza 6 of Christian Keymann's chorale \\"\\". Bach performed the cantata first year on 9 January 1724.  Scoring and structure  Similar to the Weimar cantatas, the work is scored for alto, tenor and bass soloists, a four- part choir for the chorales only, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The cantata is structured in eighth movements. # Aria (tenor, strings): # Recitative (tenor): # Chorale: # Aria (alto, oboi d'amore, strings, no continuo): # Arioso (bass): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (alto, tenor, oboi d'amore, strings): # Chorale:  Music  In the three arias Bach sets extreme affekts to music: desperate lament, intense longing and blissful joy. The first aria is based on an ostinato continuo, comparable to the opening of . First the violin, then the tenor perform an expressive melody and repeat it several times. The contrasting middle section is underlined by tremolos in the strings in daring harmonies. John Eliot Gardiner remarked in connection with his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, that on the words \\"\\" (O thunderous word in my ears), \\"it contains a graphic evocation of ear drumming\\". The second aria is accompanied by the two oboes d'amore and the violins and viola in unison, without continuo. Similar to the soprano aria in Bach's St Matthew Passion, the lack of foundation portrays fragility and innocence. The joy of the finding is expressed in a duet of alto and tenor in homophonic vocal lines of parallel thirds and sixths. It is in three parts, the third not a da capo of the first, but an affirmative conclusion in a faster 3/8 time. Movement 3 is a four-part setting of Johann Schop's tune of \\"\\" (1642), which became famous as part of , and was also used in movement 40 of the St. Matthew Passion. The closing chorale is a four-part setting of a 1658 tune by Andreas Hammerschmidt.

It operates of productive forest, as well as agriculture and wilderness management, such as hunting and fishing. History In 1860, privileges for the forestry were abolished, and Salsbrukets Interessentselskab was given access to Salsgodset, a along Salsvatnet in estate in Fosnes. Five years later, Albert Petter Severin Collett, aged 23, moved to Salsbruket as a representatives for Christiania Bank og Kredittkasse. Salsbrukets Interessentselskab was nearly bankrupt. Collett took over the company in 1871, and at the same time bought several other estates in the area, in the then-municipalities of Kolvereid and Foldereid. Collett's company started purchasing part of Bangdalens Interessentselskab, which owned estates in Klinga, Stod, Kvam and Namdalseid. By 1894, Collett had bought the entire company. All sawmill activities were concentrated to Bangsund in 1898; however, in 1905, a pulp mill was built in Salsbruket, which established the economic foundation for the village. After Albert Collett, the company was taken over by his sons Johan (b. 1874), Oscar (b. 1877) and Axel (b. 1880). In 1980, Bangsundbruket was sold to the state. On 25 October 1985, the pulp mill in Salsbruket burned down and was not rebuilt.

It connects the evolution of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes‚Äîthat of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction‚Äîas bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, but at the same time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems. The book was published by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. as a hardcover in January 2010. It was noted as being well- researched and covering a significant breadth of academic fields. However, reviews were mixed; several reviewers found that while Rifkin provided a convincing overview of the development of empathy, he did not provide sufficient proof that increased empathy would necessarily bring people together to co-operatively solve global problems. Background Author Jeremy Rifkin had previously written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, have attempted to extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting would have on the workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends. Rifkin argues that the global crisis of 2008 and 2011 marks the end of a particular energy regime‚Äîfossil fuels. The new global economy will be based upon renewable energy, like wind power, solar energy, natural gas, etc. He calls this distributed capitalism because these energy sources are dispersed rather than centralized. They are best controlled by individuals or small communities. This will entail a very different power structure from fossil fuel, financial capitalism. This new structure is networked and decentralized, and an inherently much more democratic form of globalization. Synopsis Author Jeremy Rifkin, 2009 The Empathic Civilization is divided into three parts with an introductory chapter that summarizes the contents and arguments of the book. The first part consists of four chapters and analyses empathy from the perspective of psychology, biology, and philosophy. Rifkin provides a history of empathy in psychology, including how it relates to the works of Freudian psychology, Melanie Klein, Ronald Fairbairn, Heinz Kohut, and Donald Winnicott, leading to John Bowlby and Attachment Theory. As psychological theory has evolved, empathy has played a larger and larger role, especially in the emotional and intellectual development of children. In terms of biology, Rifkin connects the biological function of mirror neurons with the capacity for empathy. Philosophically, Rifkin explores empathy-altruism, the faith versus reason debate, and truth versus reality debate. Rifkin argues in favour of relationalism, that the meaning of existence is to enter into relationships. From the lens of empathy, he deconstructs the concepts of truth, freedom, democracy, equality, mortality. The second part consists of five chapters and focuses on the rise, development, and fall of civilizations. Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality. Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically in terms of that group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small, local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god. Decentralization followed the collapse of the Roman Empire, as each town operated a water or wind mill and the printing press distributed literature, empowering more people. Autobiographies started to be written, more people married for love rather than other arrangements, and the concept of privacy, democracy, and market capitalism was more prevalent. People began to organize themselves more into nation-states. Steam and fossil fuels became the dominant energy regime and electronic communications, like telegraphs, radios, telephones, and television, became the dominant means of communication. With vastly more interaction with other people and cultures, there was more emphasis on studying people and psychology. Personal investments, social exploration, and creativity became highly valued. The third part consists of the remaining five chapters. Rifkin extrapolates the changes in energy regimes to predict a shift in production towards renewable sources like wind and solar power under distributed (i.e. personal) management. Rifkin also extrapolates the changes in communication to predict a proliferation of wireless, mobile personal communication that allows people to be constantly connected to others regardless of distance, language, or other barriers. This will evolve people's sense of empathy to create a biosphere- wide consciousness and a mode of production he calls distributed capitalism. Rifkin believes this new system will allow people to solve more complex issues, such as climate change and pathogenic pandemics, focus more on quality of life (rather than materialistic) issues, and value collaboration over competition. Style and genre The book was noted for its heft, in terms of its actual page numbers, exhaustive research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress. John N. Gray's review in The Guardian described the theme of Rifkin's argument as \\"a struggle between the polar forces of empathy and entropy\\" and that \\"as civilisation has extended the reach of empathy beyond the family and the tribe ... the expanding infrastructure of industry and transport has needed ever larger inputs of energy, increasing entropy and wrecking the planet\\". Publication The Empathic Civilization was published in January 2010 by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., an imprint of Penguin Group (USA), in North America and by Cambridge Polity Press in the United Kingdom. Cambridge Polity Press also published the book in Australia and New Zealand beginning in March 2010. A German translation was published by Campus Verlag and Spanish language version was released by Mexican publisher Paid√≥s M√©xicana. Excerpts were published in the Huffington Post and Arianna Huffington named it one of the best books of the year. Reception The book received mixed reviews by critics. Philosopher John N. Gray's review in The Guardian found that Rifkin spent most of the book defending his \\"view that humans are essentially empathic animals\\" and ultimately \\"fails to substantiate its central thesis\\" that empathy in humans will make them able to deal with a world-wide crisis, like global warming. In The Globe and Mail, the reviewer expressed a similar view that Rifkin \\"doesn't explain how...empathy can vanquish a physical principle, entropy\\". The reviewer in the Edmonton Journal admitted the book is well-researched and presents \\"an immense amount of engaging evidence\\" on empathy, but ultimately dismisses it as \\"a shallow intellectual hit\\" due to its \\"simple thesis, souped up unnecessarily\\" and \\"impression of having been written in a hurry, with a marketing rep scribbling catchphrases over Rifkin's shoulder\\". Along with the Edmonton Journal review, numerous others noted either the book's eurocentric interpretation of history or selective historiography. Michael Dudly, reviewing for the Winnipeg Free Press, labelled the book \\"ambitious\\", \\"deserving of a wide audience\\" and \\"at times fascinating but ultimately underwhelming\\". Dudley found the book \\"covers so many topics that few of them are given the depth they deserve\\" and that \\"despite the book's considerable length, it is also surprisingly limited in scope\\". For example, Dudley was disappointed with the few references made to Marshall McLuhan and the lack of reference to the works of Julian Jaynes. Likewise, the reviewer in Journal of Psychohistory was disappointed with the one reference to Lloyd deMause who the reviewer believed would have helped Rifkin's case. The book was reviewed in the journal Integral Leadership Review from a spiral dynamics point-of-view, noting that it speaks more towards people at green and turquoise.

But after several years of open ended experimentation, the Warning Light sound began to center more on atmosphere and noise. In the mid-2000s, Haddon ran the DIY noise label Sleepaway Recordings, which would release a variety of tapes and CDrs by Warning Light and Suitcases. After several years of work in those projects, Haddon also briefly played in the psychedelic synth outfit Tree Creature and minimal synth outfit High Marks.

The structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on January 2, 1979. Structure Constructed in 1931, the structure was built of reinforced concrete, with the outside finish, simulating brick, created by a poured cast. Red, Spanish tile shingles cover the roof. A prominent, 70 foot (21 meter) bell tower stands in the center of the south facade, forming part of what was the vestibule and narthex of the church. The south side of the church also features large white oak doors with decorative arches above them. Blind arches and mullions rise to the roof level, giving the structure its Romaneque character. A single story arcade joins the wings of the building and surrounds a landscaped courtyard.Chris Brewer, Historic Resources Inventory, State of California -- The Resources Agency, Department of Parks and Recreation, May 10, 1984; copy accessed from City of Bakersfield Cultural Resources Survey Downtown Area, located in the Local History room of the Beale Memorial Library, Bakersfield, California. The southwest side of the complex is the original fellowship hall, built in a Mission Revival style. The structure is characterized by lofty arched windows on its west side; on its south side is a large arched window, originally a door, flanked by smaller arched windows. The old fellowship hall and church are connected by a two-story connecting building that continues the overall Mission Revival appearance. Significance Located on a prominent spot in downtown Bakersfield, the First Baptist Church structure is considered one of the finest examples of a decorative concrete structure in the San Joaquin Valley and is a prominent landmark in Bakersfield. It is the only religious structure of its era to survive the 1952 Kern County earthquake that destroyed many of downtown Bakersfield's historic structures. It is also one of the few buildings in the area to remain relatively unaltered over the ensuing years.

Born in the Rhondda Valleys where he remained for most his life, his books reflect the working class of the industrial valleys though his vision is more optimistic and there is less concern for politics and religion which was expressed by many of his contemporaries. Although largely overlooked during his lifetime, Berry has been embraced by contemporary Welsh authors including Rachel Trezise and Niall Griffiths, and also by contemporary researchers. Personal history Berry was born in 1920 in Blaencwm, a small village at the head of the Rhondda Fawr. The son of a coal miner, Berry left school at the age of 14, and he too took employment at a local colliery. He remained a coal miner until the outbreak of World War II where he served in the British Army and later in the Merchant Navy. Berry undertook several roles in his younger days, including amateur boxing and also played association football for Swansea Town, reportedly scoring a vital goal in a cup match. Though a knee injury in 1943 ended his sporting career. He later became a carpenter, working around Wales and in London. He married Rene Jones in 1948, with whom he had five children, two sons and three daughters. He took up various jobs, and wrote some early essays and poetry for which he was unable to find a publisher. In the 1950s, Berry studied at Coleg Harlech, a further education college in Gwynedd. There he became an avid reader and honed his left-wing political views. A failed attempt to enter teacher training college saw he and Rene return to the Rhondda, taking up residence in Treherbert. It was in Treherbert, where he took on a job as the assistant manager of the local swimming baths, that he first began writing his first published novels. His written works were never successful enough to allow Berry to be financially secure and in the 1970s he relied on several friends, and the support of Sir Wyn Roberts in obtaining for him a Civil list pension. In his later life he was plagued with arthritis and poor health and he died in Pontypridd in 1997. Written work Berry's first work was Hunters and Hunted (1960), which followed the sexual adventures of three men over three seasons in a Welsh valley. It received good reviews. Over the next ten years he published a further four novels, Travelling Loaded (1963), The Full-Time Amateur (1966), Flame and Slag (1968) and So Long, Hector Bebb (1970). After So Long, Hector Bebb, Berry's published output waned. He wrote an account of watching peregrine falcons in the upper Rhondda 1987, entitled Peregrine Watching. Berry's final novel This Bygone was published in 1996. The autobiographical History is What you Live was published by Gomer in 1998) and an edited collection of short stories, Collected Stories (2000) were both released posthumously. Berry also wrote several short stories and essays, and wrote several plays for BBC television. So Long Hector Bebb and Flame and Slag were both reprinted by the Library of Wales series in 2006 and 2012. Berry also left an extensive collection of unpublished writing (including the unpublished novel 'Below Lord's Head Mountain', draft manuscripts, and correspondence, which was deposited at the Richard Burton Archives, Swansea University by Berry's family. Writing style Berry's work was deeply-rooted in the south Wales coalfield, in particular the Rhondda Fawr valley. His work was a shift from the romanticised popular work of Richard Llewellyn and Alexander Cordell, and in an interview criticised 'industrial' authors, including Gwyn Thomas and D H Lawrence, who although he admired their work, wrote of coal mining from above, and ‚Äònever sampled the muck and the mire‚Äô of working underground. As he stated in History is What You Live, he argued that to be fully understood, ‚Äòcoal mining had to be experienced day by day, year in and year out, the whole ingested for as long as oxygen fans the skull-mix‚Äô in order for the experience of the industry to be adequately expressed in fiction. Berry wrote with a strong sense of responsibility, as he was driven to write the testimony of the experience of working underground on behalf of his colleagues who were unable to do so. He also wrote on behalf of those afflicted by working underground - both those killed and injured in industrial accidents, and those suffering with lung diseases. His work is set during the process of the de-industrialisation of the south Wales coalfield; the early novels consider the more prosperous days of the early 1960s, The Full-Time Amateur sees a more affluent working class allowing the workers to purchase televisions, cars and even go abroad on holidays. His later novels however, in particular Flame and Slag, see the closure of mines, and the shift in the labour market as women started to work in factories as men lost their jobs underground. Flame and Slag is also a post-Aberfan novel, featuring a fatal tip slide which engulfs a row of houses. Regarded as one of the Wales' more significant post-war authors, along with the likes of Glyn Jones and Emyr Humphreys, some critics have shown preference to his short stories, believing that the shorter text constrained his writing away from the sometimes over- lush prose style of his novels. A perhaps unexpected element of Berry's work is his eco-writing. Both the non-fictional Peregrine Watching and History is What you Live feature a strong engagement with nature, ecology and landscape, and aspects of this also feature in his fictional work. Berry's archive papers also reveal his environmental activism. Legacy The Glamorgan County History series describes Berry as \\"...unjustly neglected... ...whose fiction thrives on those very aspects of Rhondda life that broke the spirit of Gwyn Thomas's imagination.\\" Despite being largely neglected during his lifetime, modern readers and writers have rediscovered his work. Niall Griffiths cites Berry as one of the most important influences on his writing style, being struck by the vernacular language after discovering a copy of So Long, Hector Bebb at the age of nine. Rachel Trezise also picks out So Long, Hector Bebb as a notable Welsh novel, drawn by the 'fighting, boozing and fornicating' left out of more romanticised novels such as How Green was my Valley.

This parable has been one of the most popular in tradition and although Muslims do indeed believe this story to have been a real historical event, the identity of the man involved is unknown and is unimportant in the narrative. The incident is identified by Abdullah Yusuf Ali with a number of Biblical events.The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Note. 304: This incident is referred variously; # to Ezekiel's vision of dry bones (). # to Nehemiah's visit to Jerusalem in ruins after the Captivity, and to its re-building (): and # to Uzair, or Ezra, or Esdras, the scribe, priest, and reformer, who was sent by the Persian King after the Captivity to Jerusalem, and about whom there are many Jewish narrations. As to 2 and 3, there is nothing specific to connect this verse with either. The wording is perfectly general, and we must understand it as general. I think it does refer not only to individual, but to national, death, and resurrection One identification is Ezekiel's vision of dry bones. Another is Nehemiah's visit to Jerusalem in ruins after the Captivity and to Ezra, the scribe, priest and reformer, about whom many similar tales have come down in Jewish tradition over time. However, all scholars of Islam agree that the identity of the man is least important as the tale is given in the Qur'an as a parable. Narrative The Qur'an narrates in that a man passed by a hamlet in ruins, where the people who lived there had died generations earlier, and then asked himself how God will be able to resurrect the dead on the Day of Judgment. The Qur'an goes on to say that God subsequently caused the man to die for a hundred years, and then raised him to life again. God then asked the man how long he felt he had \\"tarried thus\\", to which the man replied perhaps one day or part of day, at which point he was told the truth. On the other hand, the food and the drink the man had with him were intact, and both were as fresh as it when he had left them, showing that God has power over all things and controls time for all things. The man's donkey, however, was not only dead but was reduced to pure skeletal form. And then, by God's power, the bones joined right in front of his eyes, and the body clothed itself in muscles, flesh and blood, resulting in the donkey coming back to life. The Qur'anic verse reads: Moral This parable is used to teach various lessons.The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Note. 305: \\"A man is in despair when he sees the destruction of a whole people, city, or civilization. But Allah can cause resurrection, as He has done many times in history, and as He will do at the final Resurrection. Time is nothing before Allah. The doubter thinks that he has been dead or \\"tarried thus\\" a day or less when the period has been a century. On the other hand, the food and drink which he left behind is intact, and as fresh as it was when he left it. But the donkey is not only dead, but nothing but bones is left of it. And before the man's eyes, the bones are reunited, clothed with flesh and blood, and restored to life. Moral: Time is nothing to Allah; it affects different things in different ways; The keys of life and death are in Allah's hands; Man's power is nothing; his faith should be in Allah.\\" Firstly, it represents that time is nothing to God, who has power over time. Secondly, it teaches that the keys of life, death and resurrection are in God's control only, and that man has no power over the three. Finally, like most Qur'anic parables, it illustrates that man's power is nothing, and that his utmost faith should rest in God and God only.

Life Ayton was born in London in 1786 to William (d. 1799) and Mary Ayton. His father, a son of William Ayton, banker in Lombard Street, later moved to Macclesfield, Cheshire, and at its grammar school Ayton obtained a knowledge of Latin and Greek. In accordance with the wish of his father, who died in 1799, he was sent to study law at Manchester, and at the end of a year became the pupil of a barrister in London; but he never set himself seriously to prepare for a career. As soon as he came of age, he retired to the coast of Sussex, and resolved to live within his comparatively small income. In 1811 he returned to London, and accepted a situation in a public office; but this he relinquished in 1813, to accompany William Daniell A.R.A., in a voyage round Great Britain. An account of the voyage, with views drawn and engraved by Daniell, appeared in 8 vols. folio, 1814‚Äì25; but the letterpress of only the first two volumes is by Ayton. Disagreeing with Daniell over his plans for the future volumes, Ayton declined to proceed further with the book, and started play-writing. Two of his farces, acted at Covent Garden, were failures; but he adapted from the French several pieces for the English Opera House with moderate success. During a voyage between Scarborough and London, Ayton was nearly shipwrecked, and received an injury to his ankle which confined him to bed for more than a year. In the spring of 1821 he was sufficiently recovered to go to the coast of Sussex, but his health continued uncertain and precarious. In July 1823 his illness became serious; he moved for medical advice to London, but died shortly afterwards. During the last 18 months of his life Ayton occupied himself with light-hearted essays, chiefly on pastimes. These, with a short memoir prefixed, were published in 1825.

The interview can be accessed in the original article in FATE magazine,\\"Velikovsky: The Last Interview,\\" Fate, May 1980, pp. 80‚Äì89. or in the collection of Schadewald's writings Worlds of Their Own (Xlibris, Philadelphia, 2008). Schadewald also investigated several perpetual motion schemes and reported on them from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. Some of the contemporary perpetual motionists that Schadewald studied were: Arnold Burke, Tom Ogle, Howard Johnson, Dr. Keith Kenyon, Rory C. Johnson and Joseph Westley Newman.\\"Electricity That's Penny- Cheap?

Along the way, he also accumulated an extensive personal library. It consisted of about a thousand volumes advocating various unorthodox ideas: hollow-earth, geocentricity, creationism, Velikovskyism, perpetual motion, racism, anti-semitism, anti- Catholicism, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, flying saucers, bizarre religions, and so forth, as well as the world's most extensive collection of 19th and 20th century flat-earth literature. Much of this collection is now housed at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the Special Collections library as the Robert Schadewald Collection on Pseudo-Science. Recognized Expert on Creationism, Perpetual Motion, Flat Earth Schadewald was a nationally recognized expert on creationism, perpetual motion, and flat Earth belief.The Talk Origins Archivetheflatearthsociety.org/discussion board As an authority on pseudoscience, he appeared on radio talk shows in Minneapolis, Des Moines, Chicago, Seattle, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia and on the \\"Pittsburgh Today\\" television talk show. He also gave guest lectures on writing and various aspects of pseudoscience at numerous colleges and universities. One of Schadewald's main strategies in exposing Creationism as pseudoscience was to compare it with flat Earthism and examine the parallels between the two beliefs. Schadewald contended, they concur on a number of issues, including the authority of the scriptures as a scientific guide to the natural world, the limitations of a theory-led approach, the duplicity of conventional scientists, and the impossibility of reconciling orthodox science with the Bible.Flat Earth; The History of an Infamous Idea, 2007, Christine Garwood, St. Martin's Press, p. 356 \\"Robert Schadewald befriended Johnson (Charles Johnson, President of the International Flat Earth Research Society ca. 1971 until his death in 2001) and his wife Marjory, writing several articles on the movement that illustrated the intellectual history and themes linking the creationist movement with both flat-earth and geocentrist belief (see, for examples, Schadewald's \\"Looking for lighthouses\\" in Creation/Evolution 1992; 12 [2]: 1-4 and his \\"The evolution of Bible-science\\" in Scientists Confront Creationism, ed.

In 1983 he began attending creationist conferences, attending six major conferences in addition to the 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998 International Conference on Creationism. He reported on these with articles in the Skeptical Inquirer and Reports of the National Center for Science Education.The 1998 International Conference on Creationism, Reports of the NCSE, Volume 18 (1998) From 1986 to 1992, he served on the board of directors of the National Center for Science Education, including two years as president.In Memory of Bob Schadewald, Reports of the NCSE, Volume 20, 2000 Bibliography Books * 2008 Worlds of Their Own; A Brief History of Misguided Ideas: Creationism, Flat-Earthism, Energy Scams, and the Velikovsky Affair.

Most plantings of Madrasa are found near the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan and Armenia.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 104 Oxford University Press 1996 Origins and specifics Madrasa is indigenous to the village of Madrasa, located in Shamakhi Rayon, Azerbaijan. This variety falls into the sweet grape category. It is claimed that Madrasa was grown as early as the 15th century. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Madrasa variety was brought to the Ganjabasar region of Azerbaijan. The vines are midsize, and have strong roots and sharp leaves. The grapes are round and thick-skinned. Madrasa grapes mature in the beginning of September in Shamakhi, and in August in Ganja. The concentration of sugar ranges from 23-24% in Shamakhi and 20-21% in Ganja. Wines During the crushing and fermentation, 50% of the spirit is recovered. Widely sold \\"Giz Galasi\\" (Maiden Tower), \\"Yeddi Gozal\\" (Seven Beauties), \\"Gara Gila\\" and \\"Naznazi\\" wines are made from Madrasa. \\"Xan Madrasa\\" red table wine produced by Vinagro is made by fermentation of Madrasa grape juice. The grapes are grown in Goygol and Samukh districts of Azerbaijan, and squashed for juice. The wine is then stored for two years. Its alcoholic content is 9-14%. Xan Madrasa was awarded 2 gold and 1 bronze medals at the International Wine Contest of Monde Selection.

He spent several years during the earlier part of his ministry in the family of the Fleetwoods of Stoke Newington, then outside London. In 1713 he was ordained as pastor to a congregation in Ropemaker's Alley, Moorfields, London, where he remained for the rest of his life. Asty was involved in controversy with Martin Tomkins, another minister in Stoke Newington, who was an early Arian-Socinian; Asty asserted the Biblical-Athanasian doctrine. Later Asty signed the declaration Trinity, as promulgated in the first article of the Church of England and in the answer to the fifth and sixth questions of the Assembly's catechism, agreed on at the Salters' Hall synod, 7 April 1719.

Life His father Henry was a justice of the peace in Lancashire; his mother was Cassandra Bradshaw of Bradshaw, near Bolton. One of his brothers, William, engaged in politics, becoming M.P. for Newton, Lancashire in 1641 and for the county in 1654 whilst his other brother John became a lieutenant-colonel in the civil war. All three brothers were Parliamentarians and Presbyterians. Their sister Mary became the wife of Dr. Theophilus Howorth of Manchester. Henry Ashurst the son was apprenticed at the age of fifteen to a London draper; his prospects were advanced by a loan from the Rev. James Hiet, of Croston, Lancashire, and by his marriage with Judith Reresby. He became a successful merchant, entered the common council, and, though ejected in 1662, subsequently became an alderman. In 1667 he was living at Lauderdale House, but at the time of his death, which occurred in November 1680, he is described as of Hackney. He had the intimate acquaintance of Henry Newcome, of Manchester, Richard Baxter, who preached his funeral sermon, Matthew and Philip Henry, and others; and the writings of all these divines abound in references to him. Charity His charities to his Lancashire countrymen were extensive: he allowed needy ejected ministers in that county ¬£100 per annum, and relieved the widows of ministers. He was interested in John Eliot's missionary efforts in North America, and Eliot termed him his worthy and true friend. Ashurst acted as treasurer for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, was a trustee of Boyle's Lectures, and was a patron of religious literature. Baxter describes him as 'the most exemplary person for eminent sobriety, self-denial, piety, and charity that London could glory of, as far as public observation, and fame, and his most intimate friends could testify.' Family His son Henry, also a friend of Richard Baxter's, became a baronet; he was the builder of Waterstock. The second son, William, was knighted in 1689, and was Lord Mayor of London in 1693.

J. Van Derven, p239 was a short-lived kingdom established in Manchuria (today's Northeast China) by Jurchen warlord Puxian Wannu in 1215 during the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. It was eventually conquered by the Mongols and was later put under the Liaoyang province by the Yuan dynasty.  History  Puxian Wannu originally served the dying Jin dynasty under pressure from the Mongol Empire. While the Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Jin, a Khitan chief Yel√º Liuge (ËÄ∂ÂæãÁïôÂì•) revolted against the dynasty in Liaodong in 1211 and made contact with the Mongol Empire in the next year. In 1214 Jin dispatched Puxian Wannu to Liaodong, but he was defeated around Kaiyuan. While Mukhali of the Mongol Empire invaded Northern China and captured the Jin capital Zhongdu, Puxian Wannu rebelled against Jin and founded the Eastern Xia kingdom in Dongjing (Liaoyang) in 1215 with the support of the Mongols. During that year, as a vassal, he sent his son Tege (Â∏ñÂì•/ÈêµÂì• Tiƒõgƒì) as a hostage to the Mongols in 1216. He adopted the title of Tianwang (Â§©Áéã lit. Heavenly King) and named his era Tiantai (Â§©Ê≥∞). He also established the government institutions based on the Jin systems. Although originally acknowledged his allegiance to the Mongol Empire, he however rebelled against the Mongols and killed the Mongolian resident commissioners in 1217. He also moved the capital to Yanji in modern Jilin province and called it Nanjing (Âçó‰∫¨ literally: \\"southern capital\\"). In 1233, G√ºy√ºk (then a prince) was dispatched by √ñgedei Khan to conquer the Eastern Xia. Puxian Wannu was captured and killed in the same year, which marked the official end of the Eastern Xia kingdom. The Jin dynasty was also conquered by the Mongols in the next year. The actual name of the kingdom is controversial. Chinese documents call it Dongxia (‰∏úÂ§è/Êù±Â§è) but Goryeo almost always called it Dongzhen (Êù±Áúû). Yanai Wataru insisted that Xi√† (Â§è) was a misinterpretation of Zh√®n (Áúû). In the meanwhile Ikeuchi Hiroshi claimed that Dongzhen was an abbreviated form of Dong N√ºzhen (‰∏úÂ•≥Áúû/Êù±Â•≥Áúû, Eastern Jurchen) and was just an alias.

He was a scholar of Wadham College, Oxford, 1627; graduated B.A. 4 Dec. 1632, M.A. 1635, and became fellow of his college. He was tutor in the family of Thomas Leigh, a nonconformist, but his own sympathies were of another sort. He was the friend of Peter Heylin, who wrote, at his suggestion, on 'Parliament's Power in Laws for Religion,' which was published in 1645.

Ashwell was best known for his opposition to the principles of the Reformation, was a graduate of Cambridge University. In 1504 it is probable that Ashwell, who was then a bachelor of divinity, became rector of Mistley in Essex, and held in subsequent years the benefices of Littlebury and Halstead in the same county. In 1515 he was appointed chaplain to Lord Abergavenny's troops in France (Brewer's Letters of Henry VIII, ii. part i. 137), and six years later a prebendal stall in St. Paul's Cathedral was conferred upon him. He became prior of Newnham Abbey about 1527. In the same year he addressed a secret letter, written partly in Latin and partly in English, to John Longland, the Bishop of Lincoln, bitterly complaining of the heretical opinions held by George Joye, a bold advocate of Lutheranism, with whom he had lived on terms of great intimacy. The epistle unhappily fell into Joye's hands, and the reformer withdrew to Strasburg to escape the effects of the bishop's displeasure. Denunciation of George Joye There, however, he published Ashwell's letter, together with an elaborate reply to all the charges preferred against him. The pamphlet, of which very few copies are now extant, bears the title 'The Letter whyche Johan Ashwell, Priour of Newnham Abbey besydes Bedforde, sente secretly to the Byshope of Lyncolne in the yeare of our Lord MDXXVII. Where in the sayde Priour accuseth George Joye, that tyme beyng fellow of Peter College in Cambridge of fower opinions; with the Answere of the sayde George unto the same opinions.' The colophon runs: 'At Strazburge 10 daye of June. Thys lytell boke be delyvered to Johan Ashwell at Newnham Abbey besyde Bedforde with spede.' One of the most singular passages in the book is Ashwell's earnest entreaty to the bishop 'that no creature maye know that I or any of mine do shew you of these thinges, for then I shal leusse the favor of many in my contree' ‚Äî a passage clearly showing that the Reformation in England was eagerly expected by the prior's neighbours. A second edition of the pamphlet was published by Joye at Antwerp in 1531. Ashwell apparently somewhat modified his opinions with the times, and in 1534 he was among the first to take the oath of supremacy to Henry VIII as head of the church. But he appears to have resigned the post of prior of Newnham before 1539, when the monasteries were finally dissolved. Death His death took place shortly before 23 August 1541, when the prebendal stall in St. Paul's Cathedral, which he had held for twenty years, was declared vacant and filled up.

It has been listed as monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since April 1922.Ministry of Culture database Ch√¢teau de La Petite-Pierre History Originally there was a stronghold in the place, built by the family of Hugues IV of Nordgau (fr), Count of Egisheim. Built at the end of the 12th century, the Ch√¢teau de la Petite-Pierre is recorded from 1212. Count Hugo, either the son or grandson of the powerful Count of Blieskastel (fr), is held as the constructor. The fief was recognised as the \\"County of L√ºtzelstein\\", within the German Holy Roman Empire, approximately at the same time. The counts have used the title Graf von L√ºtzelstein, later also Comte de Petite-Pierre, meaning basically the same, also Comte de Lun√©ville (in Lorraine), which might be due to a confusion of transferral of power at some point. A probable, incomplete, order of the early counts of L√ºtzelstein, as precise documentation is not at hand: * Hugo I of Blieskastel (d.a. 1220), Count of L√ºtzelstein or Lun√©ville (or both), second son of Folmar I (d.a. 1179), Count of Blieskastel with Clementia of Metz.FMG: Folmar I, Count of Blieskastel His brother Folmar II, Count of Blieskastel was married to Jutta, daughter of Simon I, Count of Saarbr√ºcken. Hugo married Kunigunde, daughter of Konrad, Count of Kyrburg and Mathilde of Bar, and had Hugo II. ** Hugo II of Blieskastel, Count of L√ºtzelstein (1208? - a. 1246). Married Judith (Joathe) of Lorraine, daughter of Philippe, son of Frederick I, Duke of Lorraine (\\"Ferry\\"). ***Hugo III, Count of L√ºtzelstein (Perhaps also Lun√©ville) (d.a. 1280/99), married Elisabeth (d.a. 1271), daughter of Simon III, Count of Saarbr√ºcken. Probably also Elisabeth of Vinstingen, a grandniece of Simon. In 1223, due to a conflict with the Bishop of Strasbourg, the counts of Parva Petra were forced to yield it as a fief to the bishop as an episcopal stronghold, under the bishop's reign. In 1403, Friedrich of Lutzelstein died as the last was the last male heir of the castle. His uncle Bourcard/Burkhard II of Lutzelstein, Bishop of Strasbourg (in office 1393 - 1394), was one of the claimants, as well as Friedrich's sister, married to Johann of Leiningen. Burkhard (of Friedrich?) divided the property letting Palatine count Robert III, Holy Roman Emperor a fourth and the rest to his daughters. Sons of Burkhard and of the Leiningen family ruled for some time in L√ºtzelstein. However the Palatine count Frederick I (1425 - 1476) seized it all in 1452/62 as the new holders died without legitimate heirs. In 1566, it became the residence of George John I, Count Palatine of Veldenz, who carried out major works. The French Army occupied the castle in 1677; in 1681 the county was joined with in France. Vauban was charged with improving the fortifications. In 1870 that the fortifications were removed. Since 1977, the building has housed the administrative services of the Parc naturel r√©gional (Natural Regional Park) of Vosges du Nord. In the multi-media exhibition there, a room is specifically devoted to the history of the castle with, in particular, a superb model of Staedtel, the fortified old town, according to plans of 1771, and an impressive sight of the castle's ancient cistern. The fortified town, with the Saint-Louis chapel, the 15th-century church choir and the bastion tower protecting the cisterns, is closely linked to the castle. Architecture 230px The castle is located at the end of a crest, separated from the old town by an artificial ditch dating from the beginning of the 13th century. The pentagonal keep was destroyed in the 19th century. The residence has been greatly altered but in its cellar the filtering cistern dates from the 14th century. On the southern fa√ßade are Romanesque windows. The well with Renaissance decoration, the main door with pilasters and the staircase turret date from the 16th century. The polygonal construction exhibits Gothic ornamentation, in particular hooked capitals.

The district contains 94 contributing buildings, the majority of which are architecturally or historically significant. Developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century on twenty acres of land closely associated with the historical evolution of the surrounding community, the area attracted as residents many prominent artists and writers of the period. The Park structures were built on a wooded hillside, along winding roads. While in close proximity to one another, they achieve a feeling of seclusion and privacy. Few of the houses have had major alterations, and today Lawrence Park retains much of its original character. Lawrence Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The district is primarily residential and representative of early suburban growth outside New York City. Bordering Lawrence Park to the south and west is the commercial section of the Village of Bronxville, or village center, with Pondfield Road running down the center. Newer residential areas lie north and east of the district, sharply delineated by changes in terrain. Significance Lawrence Park Historic District is architecturally, historically, and culturally significant. William Van Duzer Lawrence, Lawrence Park's developer, personally oversaw the design and construction of the first homes in Lawrence Park and encouraged well-known artists and writers to make Lawrence Park their home, including artists Otto Henry Bacher, Hobart Nichols, and William Thomas Smedley, and writers Tudor Jenks, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and Alice Wellington Rollins.Van Hook, Bailey. Violet Oakley: An Artist‚Äôs Life. University of Delaware Press, 2016, p. 177. Many of these residents were also prominent in the cultural, social, and political realm of the Village of Bronxville. In spite of intrusions and alterations to buildings within the district over time, the ambiance of Lawrence Park has not changed. Lawrence Park still retains the coherence and character of an architecturally distinctive turn-of- the-century suburban development. History The twenty acres now included in the boundaries of Lawrence Park, which is within the Village of Bronxville, Town of Eastchester, are a part of a large parcel of land deeded to Thomas Pell. Pell received it from four chiefs of the Mohican tribe ‚Äî Gramatan, Annale, Wariatipus, and Wampage ‚Äî and he in turn deeded it, in 1664, to ten families from Fairfield, Connecticut. Laws for the area were established in 1665 under an agreement called the Eastchester Covenant. This document, unusual for its time, made provisions for the education of children, the disposition and upkeep of property, the support of a minister, and the regulation of all public affairs.League of Women Voters, Welcome to Eastchester: Founded 1664 (Eastchester, New York: League of Women Voters, Printed 1960, Revised and Reprinted 1966), p.6. During the eighteenth century a community began to grow because of the proximity of the Bronx River, a source of power and transportation. Pre-Revolutionary settlers included the Underhill family who originally owned much of the land in the west part of what is now the Village and operated a saw and grist mill on the river. From this family came the community's first name ‚Äî Underhill's Crossing. In the 1820s, a vein of fine white marble was discovered in nearby Tuckahoe, attracting more people to the area. Underhill's Crossing's rapid development was stimulated by the arrival of the railroad in 1844. The former Underhill mill was purchased by James Swain, whose father-in-law, James Minot Prescott, bought farm land on Sunset Hill ‚Äî 86 acres of the original Underhill holdings. Prescott built the Manor House on his land in 1845. Lawrence Park was created by William Van Duzer Lawrence (1842-1927), who, in 1890, purchased the 86 acre Prescott farm, with the idea of subdivision and development. He commissioned William A. Bates to design several houses on speculation. The first new houses in Lawrence Park were completed in 1891 and were built in a variety of revival styles including Colonial Revival, Classical Revival, Shingle and Tudor Revival. See also: Lawrence, who founded Bronxville's Sarah Lawrence College in 1928 in memory of his wife, had become a millionaire through astute business dealings in the pharmaceutical trade. Charmed by the rural character of a village only fifteen miles from New York City, he initially bought the land as a long-term property investment. A year later, however, he engaged an engineer to prepare maps, a necessary preliminary to putting buildings on the site. Lawrence took great personal care, as roads were surveyed and lots plotted, to protect the large trees and other natural features of the property. He then chose four of the most picturesque sites and hired the architect William A. Bates, who had just successfully completed a group of \\"cottages\\" at Tuxedo Park, to design four houses to be built on speculation. Bates, born in 1853 in Michigan, came to New York City at the age of nineteen to train as an architect, while working as a draftsman in the offices of Herter Brothers. By 1880 his designs for houses were appearing in architectural journals around the country. An article in the May, 1970, issue the Bronxville Women's Club magazine \\"The Villager\\" states, \\"Bates belonged to...the school of architects who worked in what one writer terms the \\"High Victorian Picturesque Eclectic\\" manner, drawing details from French and Spanish Romanesque, late French Gothic, Victorian Gothic of Italian inspiration, sixteenth-century castles on the Loire, Second Empire Norman, even early Christian Syrian monuments. Bates' early work was said to be very English... But his Bronxville tower houses seem to be more French than English...the important thing is not the historical accuracy of the design but the architect's art in harmonizing whatever his fancy leads him to, with itself and with its surroundings.\\"Marjorie Wilson DeLello, \\"William A. Bates ‚Äî One of Bronxville's First Architects,\\" The Villager (Bronxville, New York: The Bronxville Printery Corporation, vol. XLII, N.8), inside cover. The first four houses sold quickly and the new owners were in residence by June, 1891. Lawrence then had Bates renovate and modernize the Manor House, and it became an Inn. Rooms at the Manor House were available to prospective purchasers of Lawrence Park lots, to people who had bought land and wanted to stay nearby while their houses were being built; and to friends and guests of Lawrence Park residents. A second amenity for Park dwellers was the now-demolished Bates-designed Casino, used for meetings and social gatherings of all kinds. Interest in the Park was high, the Manor House was full, and Bates, under Lawrence's direction, continued to design. As the houses sold, it was found that the area was meeting a housing demand from artists and authors of New York City. Studios and libraries had to be added to existing houses and incorporated into the plans for new ones for artists such as William Henry Howe, Herman T. Schladermundt, William T. Smedley, a well-known illustrator and Otto Bacher. With such a concentration of persons in the arts, it was not long before Lawrence Park acquired the reputation of being \\"an exclusive literary and artistic development.\\" In 1896, Mrs. George Custer, widow of the general and interested in becoming part of this exclusive development, bought a lot and commissioned Bates to design the first of the two houses she eventually built in Lawrence Park. Some of the houses Lawrence built were put up for political, not social or economic reasons. When he discovered that the taxes paid by Bronxville residents were being used by the Town of Eastchester to develop Tuckahoe, Lawrence recognized that Bronxville had to be incorporated to have its own government. In order to accomplish incorporation, the Village had to give evidence of three hundred people within its boundaries. Heads were counted, but the population was not sufficient; so in the winter of 1897 Lawrence built seven larger houses for big families that would require many servants. When the new homes had been sold, noses were again counted, and Bronxville was able to incorporate.Anna Lawrence Bisland, \\"Biographical Sketch of William Van Duzer Lawrence, Founder of the Village of Bronxville,\\" The Villager (Nov., 1943), p.11. The great charm of the development lay primarily in the architecture of the houses and their relationship to the environment. In a 1904 article in Architectural Record, Theodore Tuttle stated \\"The houses belong where they are placed, as if they had grown there and were content to remain, and the general effect is tranquil refinement.\\"Theodore Tuttle, \\"A Picturesque American Suburb,\\" Architectural Record (New York: McGraw Hill Publishing Company, September, 1904), Vol. XVI, No. 3 These houses, taken as a group, today represent in practically unspoiled form all the major styles that were in fashion at the turn of the century. Romantic and fanciful, they were designed for a time of more leisurely living. \\"Among them are examples of the traditional half timber and stucco, the Colonial Revival, and the now famous 'Shingle Style,' which reflects the spirit, if not the letter, of Henry Hobson Richardson's Romanesque Revival. Translated into wood, Romanesque, which is essentially an architecture of stone, becomes picturesque, rambling, and varied. Its salient features are high roofs and high gables, often with half timbering, wide porches, and corner towers, all of which can be observed in various combinations in houses in Lawrence Park.\\"Jean Bartlett, \\"The Houses of Lawrence Park: 1891-1901\\" (Bronxville, New York, 1976), ms. n.p By 1901, a good number of the houses in the Park were completed. The greater portion were designed by Bates, whose \\"...designs were meant for country living, with their wood and stone constructions suited admirable to their lovely hillside settings. Strung along narrow winding roads and perched on rocky ledges, they offered their owners the advantage of privacy combined with great natural beauty.\\"8. Bartlett, \\"The Houses of Lawrence Park.\\" Bates' influence in Bronxville extended beyond the Park. He was responsible for the design of much of the commercial area of the Village, as well as the Mission style Hotel Gramatan, of which only the shopping arcade now remains, on which he collaborated with A.E. Barlow.Sanchis, Frank. American Architecture: Westchester County, New York. Valhalla, New York: North River Press, 1977. Residences =25 Prescott Avenue= Typical of the early homes built in the Park is the residence at 25 Prescott Avenue, built in 1891. The home was designed by Bates and serves as a fine example of the Shingle style with its undulating surfaces, diamond-paned fenestration, and gable roof. It was first acquired by Will Hicok Low, noted figure painter, muralist, and designer of stained glass. Low was a founder of the Society of American Artists and numbered among his friends Robert Louis Stevenson and Augustus St. Gaudens. A medallion of Stevenson, designed by St. Gaudens, is set into the fieldstone chimney breast of the studio that Low added to the house and shared with Charles Lewis Hinton, an illustrator and sculptor who designed the Lindbergh medal. The house was lived in continuously by artists until 1965. =26 Prescott Avenue= Located at 26 Prescott Avenue is \\"Oak Ridge Cottage\\", built in 1895 and designed by another important architect of the period, William Winthrop Kent. The former residence of William T. Smedley, a highly successful portrait painter who vied with John Singer Sargeant for commissions, the house is often referred to as \\"Owl House\\" because of the carved owl finial perched on the peak of the roof. Built on an east-west axis, all windows receive the sun. The huge pieces of stone in the lower part of the structure are said to have been quarried by men who were paid by the cubic foot. According to Tuttle in the Record, \\"Oak Ridge...while not the most pretentious in appearance, probably excites interest more than any other house in the park, and more firmly impresses itself on the mind. It is a beautiful structure, irregular and rambling, as it should be, but so well held together, withal, that it may be viewed and judged in its entirety.\\"Bartlett, \\"The Houses of Lawrence Park\\" Smedley was elected to the National Academy in 1905. He maintained a studio in New York City and his home in Bronxville had two studios. In 1916 Smedley added a garage to the home which was one of the first to be built in Lawrence Park. Since his death in 1920, \\"Owl House\\" has been lived in by prominent writers, most recently Brendan Gill of the New Yorker. =12 Sunset Avenue= \\"Gray Arches\\" at 12 Sunset Avenue was designed by Bates and built in 1891. The house is sited on one of the highest points in Lawrence Park Historic District and derives its name from the unusual design of the stone work on the porch which rests solidly on an outcropping of granite, overlooking the valley. The house and its environment provide a prime example of how the natural landscape has been treated with reverence, giving the homes an organic compatibility with their wooded surroundings. In 1892 \\"Grey Arches\\" was the summer home of the Lawrence family, and during the winter of 1894, it was the home of Kate Douglas Wiggin, author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, who described it in her autobiography as \\"...a beautiful house.\\"Rollins, Alice Wellington. Story of Lawrence Park. New York, New York: Knickerbocker Press, 1894; reprint ed., Bronxville, New York: Lawrence Park Hilltop Association, 1944. =28 Valley Road= At 28 Valley Road is the \\"Pacesetter House,\\" designed by architect Henry Eggers in 1952. It was built on the site of the 1895 William Kent residence, who designed the Bronxville Village Hall as well as several houses in the Park. The Kent House was in the Shingle style and the newer residence, which won the 1953 House Beautiful award\\"How to Build a MODERN House in an OLD Neighborhood,\\" House Beautiful, November, 1953, p.210. is also constructed of shingles with the pitched roof and rambling lines of the surrounding neighborhood architecture. The original Kent barn was used as a garage and decorative motifs from the barn are a notable feature of the interior design of the Eggers house.

It's dated to the 18th century and named after the Pourtal√®s family. History Comtesse M√©lanie by Winterhalter, 1857. The Ch√¢teau de Pourtal√®s was built around 1750 as a small manor house in the Robertsau neighborhood by Joseph Gu√©rault, then contractor of the works of the king in charge of the construction of the fortifications of Strasbourg. In 1802, Baron Paul-Athanase Renouard de Bussierre, who was from a wealthy industrial family from Strasbourg, bought the house and expanded the manor into a gracious Ch√¢teau. Between 1870 and 1914, the ch√¢teau was the residence of Comtesse M√©lanie de Pourtal√®s (n√©e de Bussi√®re) and her husband, Count Edmond de Pourtal√®s (a son of the Swiss banker and art collector, Count James-Alexandre de Pourtal√®s). Comtesse M√©lanie, a renowned French salonni√®re and Lady-in-waiting to Empress Eug√©nie, was the only surviving child of Baron Alfred Renouard de Bussi√®re, head of the Royal Mint of Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the ch√¢teau suffered fire damage. Prominent guests of the ch√¢teau included European aristocracy and members of the arts, including Albert Schweitzer, Franz Liszt, Napol√©on III and his wife, the Empress Eug√©nie, the Princes of Belgium and Russia, Ludwig I of Bavaria, the Grand Duke of Baden and the Princess Metternich. After Comtesse M√©lanie's death in 1914, the ch√¢teau was inherited by her youngest daughter, Agn√®s de Pourtal√®s, who was married to Henri, Marquis de L√∂ys-Chandieu (who had been engaged to Victoria Sackville-West before her marriage to Baron Sackville). During World War I, it was occupied by the Germans, and later liberated by the Americans. The owners of the ch√¢teau in 1939 closed the property and during World War II, it was confiscated by the Germans and used to house high-ranking officers before it was occupied by Allied Forces for a short period following the war. After the War, it was the site an Eastern European University for a short time, but was closed again following the construction of the Berlin Wall. In 1972, the nearly falling down ch√¢teau was bought by Dr. Walter Leibrecht, the founder of Schiller International University, to house students of the University. For more than 25 years, Schiller's students resided in the ch√¢teau. =Hotel Ch√¢teau de Pourtal√®s = In 2009, the Ch√¢teau de Pourtal√®s was converted to a hotel and has housed many Members of the European Parliament during the session.

The work argues that the only way to fully overcome the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 is with further coordinated global action. Brown states that a shared \\"global compact\\" on jobs and growth should be central to effective action, with different regions called on in different ways to contribute to rebalancing the global economy while boosting growth. The book includes first-hand accounts of events leading to previous successful cases of international collaboration on economic affairs. There are specific suggestions about the different ways in which the world's nations and regions can help secure global growth, jobs and poverty reduction. A secondary theme of the work is that better global oversight is needed for the international financial system. Brown suggests that to function at their best, banks and markets need shared morals. Brown started writing the book at the end of May 2010, completing it 14 weeks later while still attending to his work as an MP. Synopsis The book is divided into four parts and a total of eleven chapters. There is also a Prologue, an Introduction and a Conclusion. =Prologue= The Prologue relates how Brown decided to go ahead with his ground breaking recapitalisation plan for British banks during a transatlantic plane flight on 26 September 2008. =Introduction= The introduction takes the story in the prologue two weeks forward to 8 October, the day when the bank recapitalisation plan was announced. Brown describes how the crises evolved to become much wider than a banking crises - it became what he calls the first crises of globalisation, which if not overcome will threaten a decade or more of low growth, with millions left jobless and millions more in poverty. Brown recalls that in the last years of the 20th century, Europe and America had between them a majority share of the world's production, exports and investment. While after 2000 Europe and American had a minority share in all those areas, while still retaining a large majority of the world's consumption, financed by borrowing from the rest of the world. Brown states that this recently developed situation has become unsustainable. He says it's essential for emerging economic giants like China to further boost their consumption if global growth is to be optimised and the crises is to be fully overcome. The introduction also discusses the need for morality to inform the conduct of market participants. =Part 1= Part 1 has only one chapter, which tracks the UK government's response to the crises starting from the Sept 2007 bank run on Northern Rock and ending on 13 October 2008 after Brown's bank recapitalisation plan had been announced. In contrast to the global focus found in the rest of the book, the focus here is largely on Britain and Northern Rock (who issued false figures for mortgage arrears - p24), with some attention to cooperation and dialogue with the US and Europe, especially to Brown's work in persuading them of the need to recapitalise their own banks fearing the threat of a recession (p27). There is a brief mention of Brown's push to gain consensus for a G20 \\"heads of state\\" summit.Until 2008 the highest G20 meetings were at finance minister level. =Part 2= The 2009 G-20 London Summit - Brown asserts that measures agreed at this meeting were instrumental in preventing the global crisis from escalating into a global depression. Chapter 2 Chapter 2 is about the 1997 Asian crisis. Brown relates lessons from the earlier crisis, such as how the successful response by the Hong Kong authorities to the double play speculative attack showed that well executed government intervention can sometimes prevail over hostile markets. He diagnoses that the international community's inadequate response to the 1997 crisis is one of the reasons for the current crises, as it prompted emerging nations to focus excessively on building up foreign reserves, thus contributing to global imbalances. Chapter 3 Chapter 3 is about the current crisis, especially its relation to the banking sector. Brown asserts that the problems in banking sector was excessive and poorly understood risk taking, coupled with inadequate capital. He refers to \\"industrial scale moneymaking\\" (p84) and describes the actions of Lehman Brothers in particular as \\"unethical financial practices that were, right up to boardroom level, connived at, condoned and rewarded.\\" (p95). He describes as \\"a stunning act of intellectual honesty\\" Alan Greenspan's acknowledgement of \\"a fundamental flaw in the edifice of market economics\\" (p90). He goes on to point out that the scale of the UK emergency bail-out was 10% of the salaries the bankers paid themselves from 2000 to 2007 (p106) and argued for a global financial levy in return for the \\"risks the public takes\\" and the \\"implicit support banks enjoy from the government\\" (p106) Chapter 4 Chapter 4 is about the 2009 G-20 London Summit and the back room diplomacy that was necessary to achieve consensus for the coordinated action unveiled at that meeting. Brown discusses the role of his team in setting the stage to ensure a successful outcome. He also acknowledges the important contributions made by various other international leaders including French President Nicolas Sarkozy, U.S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. =Part 3= Chapter 5 Chapter 5 is a forward looking review of the challenges to be faced after 2010 in delivery global growth and reducing worldwide unemployment. Brown says that all nations and regions will need to act concertedly if Global trade imbalances are to be reduced and the crisis is to be fully overcome. He notes that further policies to boost domestic demand in countries with current account surpluses like China will be essential but not sufficient - regions like Africa need to be helped so they can become new engines of global growth - and the US and Europe need to ensure their deficit reduction plans are combined with growth friendly policies. Brown discusses an International Monetary Fund report, which suggested that effective global cooperation in the years leading up to 2014 could reduce global unemployment by as much as 50 million and help lift an additional 90 million people out of poverty. Chapter 6 Chapter 6 contains analysis on the United States. Brown sketches the specific challenges facing the US including their high level of net debt and on-going current account deficit. He says America also has exceptional qualities which can help them overcome their problems if marshalled wisely. Brown concludes the US economy needs to become more export orientated and that the government needs to ensure adequate levels of investment, which are unlikely to be delivered by the private sector alone. Chapter 7 Chapter 7 is about the opportunity available to China. Brown advises that with increased switching from policies favouring exports to those aimed at boosting domestic demand, China can contribute to reducing global imbalances, while at the same time sustaining her own high growth and further reducing domestic poverty. Brown acknowledges that China has now been moving in this direction for several years, but says that further progress will help both China and the wider world. Chapter 8 Chapter 8 covers India, the rest of Asia, Russia and Latin America. Brown praises India as a country that has achieved high growth without worsening global imbalances, which she had done by not running either a large current account surplus or deficit. He notes however that internally India's growth has been uneven and that further policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in the lagging regions will be important for achieving sustained growth. Chapter 9 Chapter 9 focuses on Europe and the specific challenges relating to the Eurozone currency union. Brown says it's important for deficit reduction plans to be combined with growth friendly policy and that greater fiscal co-operation and flexibility will be needed to keep the Eurozone together. Chapter 10 Chapter 10 is about Africa, which Brown says was much harder hit by the crises than was Asia or Latin America. Brown says the continent has enormous potential and can become a new engine of growth for the whole world. He advises that help from G20 countries will be needed, both to boost investment in infrastructure and to make sure African countries have access to the markets of developed nations to help boost trade. Chapter 11 Chapter 11 sums up Brown's thoughts on the need for coordinated global action to reduce unemployment and poverty while boosting growth. He says that different regions are called on to act in different ways, but if nations work collaboratively it will help them better achieve both their individual domestic goals and to boost global growth as a whole. He argues that monetary policy and keeping deficits low \\"will not be sufficient to keep unemployment down\\" and that deficit reduction will be \\"linked to the speed of economic recovery\\" (pp 225‚Äì6). He points out that it is not possible for every country to solve the global problem by exporting (p229) and that prosperity, to be sustained, has to be shared (p231). =Part 4= Part 4 contains just a Conclusion and an Appendix. The Appendix relates a speech Brown made back in 1998, in the aftermath of the Asian financial crises, discussing the need for enhanced global cooperation on economic issues. The Conclusion reiterates Browns themes. Brown recaps on the need for the decision making of market participants to be informed by ethical concerns and not purely by the profit motive. Brown also stresses the need for global cooperation to achieve poverty reduction, a fair distribution of resources and lower unemployment - goals which Brown says reflects the values held by the world citizens. Reception In a positive review by economist Joseph Stiglitz, the reviewer argues that Brown's position is correct on all counts. Stiglitz notes that the book is focussed firmly on global policies and issues - in contrast to other political memoirs it contains no political gossip. Stiglitz says that without dwelling on the past, Brown tries to highlight the lessons previous events have for us. Lord Skidelsky says that Brown was the right man in the right place when it came to responding to the crisis, noting that efforts to coordinate economic recovery collapsed once Brown left the international stage. Skidelsky identifies two major acts of global leadership, the recapitalisation of banks and the coordination of fiscal and monetary stimulus, especially the one trillion dollar package announced at the London G-20 Summit. Skidelsky relates how the World Bank's president Robert Zoellick said the package \\"broke the fall\\" of the world economy. While mostly in agreement with Brown, Skidelsky writes that his successes in 2008 and 2009 have made Brown overly optimistic about what can be achieved at global summits, and that the road to achieving a \\"global compact\\" for jobs and poverty reduction will be rocky, if it can be travelled at all. Samuel Brittan in The Financial Times opines that Brown's message on the continual need for aggregate demand to be maintained very much needs to be heard, especially by European politicians who may be overly influenced by deficit cutting fiscal fundamentalism. In a mostly positive review for The Guardian, David Lipsey largely agrees with Brown's themes and rebuts some of the criticism against him. But Lipsey suggests Brown does deserve some of the criticism from the left, who argue he did too little to punish bankers for the crisis and allowed too many of the consequences to fall on ordinary people. Tracey Boles for the Sunday Express focuses mainly on the book itself rather than the macro economic issues, saying that the work contains \\"fascinating insights\\" into the working of global governments as well as a few engaging incidents that shed light on Brown's home life. She says it would have been better if Brown had spent more time relating how he felt rather than discussing economic theory. Boles concludes by saying that Brown did help limit the global crisis but also that he was partly responsible for the conditions that caused it. In a mostly critical review, Peter Oborne of The Daily Telegraph commented that \\"most fair-minded observers would concede that Brown's reaction to the events that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers was his finest hour\\" and goes on to praise Brown's global leadership in this period. He suggests though that Brown was wrong to claim the London G20 had saved the world from a global depression, saying the effect of the package agreed at that summit were \\"marginal and transitory.\\" Oborne criticises Brown's \\"pathetic\\" handling of his economic mistakes made during the 11 years leading up to the crisis. He also criticises the way Brown seems to praise his colleagues according to whether or not he likes them. Oborne says the book is a difficult read: jargon laden, repetitive and marred by overly long sentences. He ends by saying that there is something moving about the book, that despite the poor writing and self-delusion, Brown's moral integrity and genuine desire to do good shine through. Reviews by John Gray for New Statesman and by The Economist magazine also criticise Brown for not recognising his own culpability during the years leading up to the crises. Gray argues that Brown had largely accepted neoliberal economic thinking, leading to his advocacy of light touch regulation for the City. The economist's review also notes that while Brown stresses the Market's needs for morals, he doesn't give any practical suggestions on how morality could be encouraged in the financial sector.

Construction began in 1205 and was completed around 1400. It has been listed since 6 December 1898 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.French Ministry of Culture, Ruines du ch√¢teau Salm History Detail of the ruins The Ch√¢teau de Salm was built between 1205 and 1225 by Henry III, Count of Salm (of Haute Lorraine), on the territory of the Senones Abbey of which he was the lawyer. The Salm dynasty originated in the 13th century with the Counts of Bar (Bar-le-Duc), one of the more powerful families of Lorraine. The Salm-Lorraine dynasty came from the Luxembourg family. Henry IV, grandson of the builder, reorganized the saltpans of Morhange as well as the Framont forges which were situated close by. Industrial politics provoked a military reaction around 1259 from the Bishop of Metz, who occupied the installations and forced the count to sell him the castle at Salm and the Ch√¢teau de Pierre-Perc√©e and to swear fealty to him. When the bishop left the castles, the count retook the fortresses. In 1285, the trouv√®re from Lorraine, Jacques Bretel, spent several days at the castle where he met Count Henry IV. He recounted his stay in his work le Tournoi de Chauvency. The area was the site of an important occupation throughout the 14th and 15th centuries (with foundry, metallurgy and pottery activities), without a doubt the after-effects of the acquisition by Jean de Salm of the lower valley of Bruche in 1366, from Mutzig to Schirmeck. The large works completed around 1400 considerably altered the castle's defences with the construction of a thick shielding tower, a barbican and a new gate. The old shield wall was torn down and adapted for new functional requirements. The castle seems, however, to have been ruined around 1500 because it is recorded as a ruin in 1564, though no documentary record of violent destruction is known. Prince Constantin Alexander of Salm-Salm visited the castle in 1779 in the company of the prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst, to see an inscription on the bas-relief of an outside wall. The ruins served as a quarry soon after the annexation of the Principality of Salm-Salm by the French Republic in 1793. It was bombarded by French artillery during the First World War in 1914 because a German observation post had been established there. Integrated into German territory by the Treaty of Frankfort in 1871, the vestiges of it were classified as a historic monument by the Imperial Administration of Alsace- Lorraine on 6 December. In 1919, the territory was attached to the French d√©partement of Bas-Rhin. Description Constructed at 809 metres above sea level on a rocky hill of red sandstone with a northeast-southwest orientation, the castle extends on different levels over an area of approximately 120 metres by 50 metres. The primitive castle of the 13th century, or Kernburg, was equipped in the southwest with a shield wall facing possible attack, behind which were living quarters and the cistern. A palace, or Palas, which shows the remarkable architectural quality of elements which composed the decoration, is situated opposite the curtain walls in the northwest and northeast, which dominate the keep, or Bergfried (tower refuge), constructed on the rock's highest point (its northern extremity). In the course of the 14th century, the shield wall was reinforced by one or two flanking towers before a shield tower and a postern were constructed in the front, maybe around the beginning of the 15th century. Details of the ruins Since 2004, conservation workers employed by the association of Veilleurs de Salm have been able to excavate lost walls and to progressively understand more of the different stages of construction. The reading of the plans nevertheless remains very difficult, in comparing them to the few ruins which are left. Few significant traces remain of the shield tower, the vaulted ceilinged room that housed the cistern, which is rare in Alsace, and the postern. Analysis of the ruin's details shows the presence of large basses-cours built at the end of the fourteenth century, a barbican and more interior battlements with doors and window slits, but also the presence of cross-shaped windows for crossbowmen in the 13th century. The richness of the movable architecture (still under investigation) suggests the presence of a chapel, which was generally a standard fixture of a count's castle. The shield tower, which is flush with the second floor, has a large artificial hole (damage?). It is named thus not only because it was intended to face siege cannons (the thickness of the wall reaching 3 metres), but also because it hid the castle behind it. The princely visit of 1779 was preceded by important repair works which weighed heavily on the face of the ruins. Even today, the plan and chronology of the castle's construction is still open to interpretation, the assembly of data and analysis of gothic elements place this castle among the most beautiful counts' achievements of the 13th century in Alsace and Lorraine.
