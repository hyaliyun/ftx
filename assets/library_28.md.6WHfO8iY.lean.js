The style \\"Bradshaw Gass & Hope\\" was adopted after J. J. Bradshaw's death and referred to the remaining partners John Bradshaw Gass and Arthur John Hope. History Bradshaw, Gass and Hope is Bolton's oldest architectural practice. It was founded by Jonas James Bradshaw who opened an office in Nelson Square in 1862 and moved to 19, Silverwell Street in 1871. His nephew John Bradshaw Gass joined the company in 1882 and Arthur John Hope was articled to the firm in 1892 before becoming a partner in 1902. The firm's principal office is in Bolton, but branch offices were set up in Edinburgh and London when major projects were undertaken. Although Bradshaw was capable of designing fine Gothic Revival houses, like Watermillock (1880‚Äì86) near Bolton, he mainly produced industrial buildings. The technical challenges of early iron and concrete framed factories led Bradshaw to employ engineers and quantity surveyors and thus founded one of the first multidisciplinary practices. The emphasis on engineering in the practice seems to have benefited John Parkinson (1861‚Äì1935), Bradshaw's apprentice from 1877 to 1882, who immigrated to America where he designed a number of high-rise buildings including Los Angeles City Hall (1928). In the early twentieth century, Bradshaw Gass & Hope gained national prominence after winning a number of architectural competitions; the firm built seven town halls between 1928 and 1939 and extended Bolton Town Hall. During this period, Bradshaw Gass & Hope attracted many architecture students; half a dozen of these students would later head council architects departments across the country.Austen Redman (2007), Bolton Civic Centre and the Classical Revival Style of Bradshaw Gass & Hope. in Clare Hartwell & Terry Wyke(editors), Making Manchester& Cheshire Antiquarian Society, Until the 1960s most of the firm's work was in the Classical idiom.

There are only four public observatories operating in the United Kingdom, all of which are in Scotland. Airdrie Observatory is the smallest, and second oldest. The observatory is owned and funded by Culture NL, and operated on their behalf by the Airdrie Astronomical Association (AAA), a local astronomy club and registered charity.https://culturenl.co.uk/libraries/airdrie-observatory/ The current observatory curators are AAA members Hannah Robinson and William Tennant. Main telescope The Observatory's main refracting telescope Airdrie Observatory is home to a 6\\" Victorian refracting telescope with an equatorial mount and clockwork drive which is used to track objects across the sky. A manual mechanism is used to open and rotate the observatory's dome. The telescope eyepieces for the telescope provided a range between 60 and 350 times magnification. The telescope was adapted to use more modern eyepieces. In its day, the Airdrie Observatory telescope would have been considered to be a research grade telescope. History Dr Reid's refractor telescope in Airdrie Public Observatory The Airdrie Observatory dome. From 1896 to 1925 Airdrie Observatory was located in the original Airdrie Public Library (which became Airdrie Arts Centre). This library was funded in part by a ¬£1,000 donation from Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American philanthropist. The original 3.25‚Äú refracting telescope was given to the town by Dr Thomas Reid, an eminent Glasgow oculist and philanthropist. This telescope is no longer in use as repairs cannot be undertaken due to its age and fragility, but it can be seen in the local history room of today's library. Eventually the library was deemed to be too small and on 25 September 1925, the current library building was opened, funded this time by Airdrie Savings Bank and by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. The purpose-built observatory was incorporated into the new library building, with its dome on the library roof. In 2013, the observatory underwent extensive refurbishment, including the installation of a new dome, and restoration of the main telescope.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/new-dome-installed- airdrie-observatory-2831851 Apollo astronauts' visits Charlie Duke at Airdrie Observatory.

Salaway's pseudonym is derived from the Pig Latin translation of his first name (and thus is a \\"pen\\" name in two senses.) While his 1955 book, And Kill Once More, is a whodunit in the classic style, Salaway's 1957 and 1958 novels have more to do with the common man's involvement in crime and the moral dilemmas that arise as he confronts his own behavior and that of others. In this way, Salaway's fiction may reflect the same zeitgeist that produced many of the most cerebral television scripts of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as those of Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone, etc.) and Gene Roddenberry (Have Gun, Will Travel, etc.).

It reached No. 17 in the UK Albums Chart and the \\"Miss the Girl\\" single peaked at No. 21. With their first album, the band embraced exotica, including \\"waves crashing on beaches\\", \\"found-sound effects from nature\\" and local Hawaiian chanters. Critic Ned Raggett described it as \\"a lush, tropical experience\\". Recording and music Siouxsie and Budgie decided where to record the album by randomly placing a pin on a map of the world; the result was the U.S. state of Hawaii. Several songs are about their experiences in that region, including \\"Festival of Colours\\" and \\"A Strutting Rooster\\". Mark Brennan of Melody Maker said that the album's opening track \\"Morning Dawning\\" \\"begins with the sound of complicity: waves rushing against a beach, waves that are [...] the languid laps of dawn ‚Äì a soundtrack for the netherland that are souvenirs between memories of dark and anticipations of light, the state between lingering in the past and launching into the future\\".Brennan, Mark. \\"The Naked Lunch [Feast review]\\".

Release Feast was released by Polydor Records on 15 May 1983, two years after the Wild Things EP. Feast was also the first album released on Wonderland, a label created in 1983 by the members of Siouxsie and the Banshees.

He earned AFL All-Star honors as a rookie after making 27 receptions for 705 yards, with 6 touchdowns and 26.1 average yards per reception. In 1971, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots after relocating to Foxborough. During that season he missed four games due to injuries and lost his starting position. On July 13, 1972, he was traded to the Super Bowl champions the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a third round draft choice (#73-Charles Davis). =Dallas Cowboys= In 1972 he was a backup until the seventh game, when he was promoted to replace Bob Hayes in the starting lineup, in order to take advantage of his big play ability. Even though he finished the season as the Cowboys top receiver, registering 31 receptions for 653 yards, five touchdowns and a 21.1 yards average per reception, the team looked to upgrade its receiving corps, by trading him along with a second round draft choice to the Super Bowl champions the Miami Dolphins, in exchange for Otto Stowe. =Miami Dolphins= In 1973, he had a disappointing season after playing in three games and catching only two passes. He was released on September 10, 1974.

Created by former head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden as the son of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman), the character was born during the episode airing on October 13, 2006, Initially portrayed by various child actors, including Robbie Tucker, the character was rapidly aged to a teenager in 2012, with Max Ehrich assuming the role through 2015. In 2018, the role was recast with Zach Tinker. As a teenager, the character's storylines have included a romance with Summer Newman (Hunter King), as well as a cyberbullying plot with Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo), which was generally well received by the actors and public. Fenmore has also developed a \\"dark side\\", coinciding with teenage angst. Ehrich characterized the character as being at a \\"vulnerable age\\", while \\"trying to find his place in the world\\". Ehrich's portrayal has received a positive response; Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described the actor as talented, as well as Luke Kerr of Zap2it praising Ehrich for \\"mastering the crazy behind-the-eyes element\\" of the character's relatives. Ehrich's portrayal garnered him four consecutive Daytime Emmy Award nominations between 2013 and 2016. Casting The role was first portrayed by three sets of twins, including Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales over the course of 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a \\"long audition process\\", saying: \\"I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father.\\" When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: \\"I'm still on recurring right now. I think it's all relevant to your character and either way, in my book, it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right.\\" Ehrich last aired on May 18, 2015. In November 2018, Ehrich announced on Instagram that he'd been asked to reprise the role, however, due to a string of stalking incidents, he could not return; as a result, Zach Tinker was announced as a recast. Tinker debuted in the role on December 3, 2018. Tinker was written out on February 11, 2019. In November 2019, it was reported that Tinker will be returning to the show; airing the week of December 23. Development =Characterization= When Ehrich first stepped into the role, he stated: \\"There [are] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It's such a vulnerable age, so really there [are] so many different paths I can go down. And there's so much that can happen. I‚Äôm very, very curious to see where they go with it.\\" When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: \\"He is definitely figuring himself out. You‚Äôre on the brink of adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [And] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he's definitely going through some stuff.\\" In another interview, he described Fenmore as \\"trying to find his place in the world\\", saying: \\"When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong.\\" Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become \\"creepy\\" during his angst and acting out. =Teenage angst= Christian LeBlanc, who portrays the character's father Michael Baldwin, stated that Fenmore's storyline was \\"really fascinating\\" and would have a \\"rippling effect\\" on the character's entire family. When Fenmore and female character Summer Newman (Hunter King) were rapidly aged to teenagers at the same time, Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment previewed: \\"These two kids may learn about some of the insane things their parents have done ‚Äì as fans know, that says a lot!\\" She also wrote that given who their parents are, \\"that can only mean trouble\\". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: \\"Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that.\\" In another interview, he stated of their relationship: \\"I think Fen‚Äôs first love is Summer; he falls in love; he‚Äôs infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it‚Äôs going is ‚Äì will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he‚Äôs still the same kid, it‚Äôs just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase.\\" Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she \\"was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them.\\" Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has \\"troubled youth to deal with\\", saying: \\"It‚Äôs the first time on Y&R; that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It‚Äôs going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [There‚Äôs a] rippling effect, like every good story.\\" The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: \\"Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime ‚Äî in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie.\\" Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: \\"Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre a victim of it ‚Äì you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it‚Äôs like, \\"This is real; this is what happens\\". People need to know the truth of what is going on out there.\\" In another interview, Ehrich expressed more of his opinions on the storyline, stating: \\"It‚Äôs so relevant now and it‚Äôs such an epidemic. Just for it to be out there to show that it happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I‚Äôve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people‚Äôs reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids.\\" Of the character's \\"dark side\\", Ehrich stated: \\"I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen is supposed to be the crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one.\\" He also stated that \\"as an actor, it's fun to go out of control\\", saying: \\"As an actor, it‚Äôs fun when you‚Äôre out of control, and you don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I‚Äôve had numerous times on this show where I‚Äôve gotten to be out of control, and it‚Äôs a really nice feeling. It‚Äôs exhilarating.\\" He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go \\"too far\\", saying: \\"He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey‚Äîa long, long journey to find some peace.\\" Storylines Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) gave birth to Fenmore prematurely, and he was forced to remain in the hospital for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal. Fenmore was befriended by Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper), the man whom Lauren was having an affair with, while also trying to win over Summer again, who was crushing on Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer). Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status. Afterward, he is befriended by Raven (Amanda Leighton); they go to a graduation party, do drugs and talk about their social struggles. When Fenmore discovers Carmine's affair with his mother, he isolates himself from his family and continues to do drugs. Afterward, he asks Carmine to help him obtain more drugs, and while he refuses, he finds Fenmore unconscious in the back of the local restaurant. When he awakens in the hospital, he tells his parents that Carmine gave him the drugs that he overdosed on, but he later confesses that this was a lie. After stealing drugs from the hospital and getting caught, Michael and Lauren send Fenmore to rehab. After being released for an event in which Lauren would be crowned businesswoman of the year, Carmine is shot to death in an alleyway. Fenmore is convinced he murdered Carmine but admits to being high on drugs at the time and can't remember clearly. Michael decides to confess to the murder to protect his family, and he is sent to prison. Knowing that his father did not kill Carmine, Fenmore steals drugs and purposely gets caught so he can be put in prison as well. While in prison, Fenmore tries to make deals with other prisoners to get his father's sentence reduced, as Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) try to uncover the truth behind Carmine's death. Michael is later released after Fen confesses to killing Carmine, worrying his parents. As Paul, Christine and Michael continue to hit dead ends on solving Carmine's murder, Fen announces he wants to confess to a judge and be sentenced prison time; Christine and Lauren however are strongly against it. Just as Fen decides he is going to confess to the judge, Michael discovers that Carmine is in fact alive. He reveals that he was in fact being transported into witness protection the day of the banquet for giving the FBI evidence against another criminal, but he wanted to see Lauren one last time. Fen shot him that night but doctors and medical examiners secretly revived him and sent him into witness protection. He refuses to return to Genoa City to exonerate Fen because of his own safety, so instead Michael films him confessing that he is alive. Michael arrives with the video before Fen can confess, and he is exonerated. After being reunited with his family, Michael and Lauren later mention that Fen had gone to Arizona to visit potential colleges. Reception Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was surprised by the decision to age both Fenmore and Summer Newman (Hunter King) at the same time. Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote, \\"Don't they grow up fast?\\", referring to Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote that aging the characters would help to \\"beef up\\" the soap opera's summer storylines. Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would \\"have issues with his parents the way other aged kids on the show have of late\\". Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: \\"Recently, the powers-that-be at Y&R; chose to age Lauren and Michael‚Äôs tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears ‚ÄúFen‚Äù may be a chip off the old block ... sort to speak. The talented Max Ehrich was cast as the new Fen, and since he has begun to air in the part he has received high marks, not only from his scene partners, but daytime fans, too.\\" He also called Fenmore's family \\"one of the most fascinating TV families\\". Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he \\"really likes\\" Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: \\"He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart).\\" Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: \\"A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing. No, this isn't the back page copy for Jodi Picoult's next best- selling novel, it's the saga of the Baldwins on The Young and the Restless!\\" In 2013, Ehrich received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Fenmore. On the day the actor was informed of his nomination, Ehrich stated: \\"I‚Äôve been in daydream all day. I feel like I was hit by an electric current.\\" He admitted that it was a \\"pretty easy choice\\" choosing which scene to submit for consideration; Ehrich chose a scene where Fenmore tells Jamie that Summer is the one cyberbullying him. He stated that he chose that episode \\"because that day, I felt this outer body experience. I was not in control at all\\". Of his nomination, Ehrich stated: \\"It‚Äôs an honor, and it‚Äôs something I hope will hit me really soon, because it doesn‚Äôt feel real at all!\\" However, Ehrich lost the award to Days of Our Lives star Chandler Massey for his portrayal of Will Horton.

It is located about 20 kilometres south of the state capital, Kota Kinabalu, and Kinarut railway station is one of the stops on the Sabah State Railway. Kinarut is under the administration of the Papar District.  Etymology  Several theories exist as to the etymological origins of the name 'Kinarut'. One such theory is that it refers to a street in the town which was formerly called China Road.Richard Nelson Sokial: Colonial Townships in Sabah: West Coast, Homeland Publisher Sdn Bhd, 2012, Page 224-236, Another theory is that it originated from the Dusun word Kinorut which means 'cutting using a knife'.  History  Colonial-era shoplots Kinarut originally belonged to the Sultanate of Brunei. In the late 17th century, when Sultan Abdul Hakkul Mubin had to withdraw from Chermin Island (Pulau Chermin) during the Brunei Civil War, he built a base in Kinarut at a strategic location protected by two rivers. He remained there for ten years as the Sultan of Kinarut, during which incidents of piracy in the surrounding seas decreased significantly. With help from the local Bajau and Dusun people, he managed to counter several attacks from Sultan Muhyiddin. Demographics A 2010 census estimated the population of Kinarut at 18,029. This population consists mainly of Bajaus, Bruneian Malays, Kadazans and Chinese (of whom most are Hakka Chinese) There is also a large Filipino refugee settlement in Kinarut, which has reportedly caused ethnic tension among locals.

A complete forward line consists of a left wing, a center, and a right wing, while a pair of defensemen who play together are called \\"partners.\\" Typically, an NHL team dresses twelve forwards along four lines and three pairs of defensemen, though some teams elect to dress a seventh defenseman, or a thirteenth forward. In ice hockey, players are substituted \\"on the fly,\\" meaning a substitution can occur even in the middle of play as long as proper protocol is followed (under typical ice hockey rules, the substituting player cannot enter the ice until the substituted player is within a short distance of the bench and not actively playing the puck); substitutions can still be made during stoppages. Usually, coordinated groups of players (called linemates) are substituted simultaneously in what are called line changes. Linemates may change throughout the game at the coach's say. Ice hockey is one of only a handful of sports (gridiron football and basketball being the two most prominent others) that allows for unlimited free substitution and uses a system of multiple sets of players for different situations. Because of the use of lines in hockey, ice hockey teams have relatively large rosters compared to the number of players on the ice (23 for a typical NHL team, with 20 active on game day and six on the ice at any given time). Only gridiron football has a larger relative roster size (the NFL has 53 players, 46 active on gameday, 11 on the field). Types of line *The first line is usually composed of the best offensive players on the team. Teams rely heavily on this line, which generates the bulk of the team's scoring. These players often see the highest number of minutes among forwards in a game and are usually part of the team's starting lineup. *The second line is generally composed of second-tier offensive players, and helps by adding supplementary offense to that generated by the first line while contributing more two-way play than the offensively-focused scoring line. Higher end (typically first line) players may be put on the second line to spread scoring across the lineup, making a team more difficult for opponents to defend against. This frequently happens when a team has two high-end players who play the same position. *The third line is often called the checking line, and is generally made up of more defensively oriented forwards and grinders. This line is often played against an opponent's first or second lines in an effort to reduce their scoring, and physically wear them down. The third line adds less offense than the first or second lines, but generally more than the fourth. *The fourth line is often called the \\"energy line,\\" both because their shifts give other players a chance to rest, and because their physically oriented play is said to give their teammates an emotional boost. It is usually composed of journeymen with limited scoring potential, but strong physical play and, as often as possible, strong skating abilities. With the smallest amount of ice time, they tend to play in short bursts rather than pace themselves. Pests and enforcers usually play the fourth line, as do centers whose primary skill is winning faceoffs. The fourth line can be a checking line. *A penalty kill unit is a specialized group of four or three players employed when a team is shorthanded due to a penalty. As the name describes, this is a primarily defensive unit meant to prevent the opposing team from scoring during their power play. *A power play unit is a specialized group of five or four players when the opposing team has been called for a penalty and is shorthanded.

He had played 95 league games for the Saints, scoring seven goals.League statistics by season and photo at Sporting heroes He remained at Southampton until 1982, when he was sold to Oxford United. During his final season at Southampton, he had loan spells with Bolton Wanderers and Leicester City. Oxford United and Derby County Hebberd was a key player in Oxford's Third Division title triumph in 1984 and their Second Division championship glory the following year. In 1986 he achieved the finest moment of his career by helping Oxford win the League Cup at Wembley with the opening goal in a 3‚Äì0 victory. He received the man of the match award. When Oxford were relegated from the First Division in 1988, Hebberd was sold to Derby County and in his first season he helped them finish fifth in the league. But, like Oxford's League Cup triumph three years earlier, the ban on English clubs in European competition meant that Hebberd was unable to experience the UEFA Cup, and County were relegated to the Second Division two years later.

Both effects will reduce the pipe's overall thermal efficiency when used as a heat exchanger. Boiler feedwater is an essential part of boiler operations. The feed water is put into the steam drum from a feed pump. In the steam drum the feed water is then turned into steam from the heat. After the steam is used it is then dumped to the main condenser. From the condenser it is then pumped to the deaerated feed tank. From this tank it then goes back to the steam drum to complete its cycle. The feed water is never open to the atmosphere. This cycle is known as a closed system or Rankine cycle. History of feedwater treatment During the early development of boilers, water treatment was not so much of an issue, as temperatures and pressures were so low that high amounts of scale and rust would not form to such a significant extent, especially if the boiler was ‚Äúblown down‚Äù. It was general practice to install zinc plates and/or alkaline chemicals to reduce corrosion within the boiler. Many tests had been performed to determine the cause (and possible protection) from corrosion in boilers using distilled water, various chemicals, and sacrificial metals.Lyon,Frank. Hinds, A.W.Marine And Naval Boilers. (1912). The Lord Baltimore Press. Silver nitrate can be added to feedwater samples to detect contamination by seawater. Use of lime for alkalinity control was mentioned as early as 1900, and was used by the French and British Navies until about 1935.Osbourne, Alan. Modern Marine Engineers Manual. (1965). Cornell Maritime Press, inc. In modern boilers, treatment of feedwater is critical, as problems result from using untreated water in extreme pressure and temperature environments. This includes lower efficiency in terms of heat transfer, overheating, damage, and costly cleaning. Characteristics of boiler feedwater Water has higher heat capacity than most other substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers are part of a closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns in order to keep the chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated. Boiler feedwater treatment Boiler water treatment is used to control alkalinity, prevent scaling, correct pH, and to control conductivity. The boiler water needs to be alkaline and not acidic, so that it does not ruin the tubes. There can be too much conductivity in the feed water when there are too many dissolved solids. These correct treatments can be controlled by efficient operator and use of treatment chemicals. The main objectives to treat and condition boiler water is to exchange heat without scaling, protect against scaling, and produce high quality steam. The treatment of boiler water can be put into two parts. These are internal treatment and external treatment. (Sendelbach, p. 131)Sendelbach, M. (1988). Boiler-water treatment: Why, what and how. Chemical Engineering, 95(11), 127. The internal treatment is for boiler feed water and external treatment is for make-up feed water and the condensate part of the system. Internal treatment protects against feed water hardness by preventing precipitating of scale on the boiler tubes. This treatment also protects against concentrations of dissolved and suspended solids in the feed water without priming or foaming. These treatment chemicals also help with the alkalinity of the feed water making it more of a base to help protect against boiler corrosion. The correct alkalinity is protected by adding phosphates. These phosphates precipitate the solids to the bottom of the boiler drum. At the bottom of the boiler drum there is a bottom blow to remove these solids. These chemicals also include anti-scaling agents, oxygen scavengers, and anti- foaming agents. Sludge can also be treated by two approaches. These are by coagulation and dispersion. When there is a high amount of sludge content it is better to coagulate the sludge to form large particles in order to just use the bottom blow to remove them from the feed water. When there is a low amount of sludge content it is better to use dispersants because it disperses the sludge throughout the feed water so sludge does not form. Deaeration of feed water Oxygen and carbon dioxide are removed from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be accomplished by using deaerator heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters, steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready to be used in the boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in two groups: spray types and tray types. With tray type heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerator is similar to the tray type deaerator. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also aids the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed into the tank like the spray and tray deaerator. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere. (Sendelbach, p. 130) Conditioning Large cation/anion ion exchangers used in demineralization of boiler feedwater. The feedwater must be specially treated to avoid problems in the boiler and downstream systems. Untreated boiler feed water can cause corrosion and fouling. =Boiler corrosion= Corrosive compounds, especially O2 and CO2 must be removed, usually by use of a deaerator. Residual amounts can be removed chemically, by use of oxygen scavengers. Additionally, feed water is typically alkalized to a pH of 9.0 or higher, to reduce oxidation and to support the formation of a stable layer of magnetite on the water-side surface of the boiler, protecting the material underneath from further corrosion. This is usually done by dosing alkaline agents into the feed water, such as sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) or ammonia. Corrosion in boilers is due to the presence of dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, or dissolved salts. =Fouling= Deposits reduce the heat transfer in the boiler, reduce the flow rate and eventually block boiler tubes. Any non-volatile salts and minerals that will remain when the feedwater is evaporated must be removed, because they will become concentrated in the liquid phase and require excessive \\"blow- down\\" (draining) to prevent the formation of solid precipitates. Even worse are minerals that form scale. Therefore, the make-up water added to replace any losses of feedwater must be demineralized/deionized water, unless a purge valve is used to remove dissolved minerals. =Caustic embrittlement= =Priming and foaming= Locomotive boilers Steam locomotives usually do not have condensers so the feedwater is not recycled and water consumption is high. The use of deionized water would be prohibitively expensive so other types of water treatment are used. Chemicals employed typically include sodium carbonate, sodium bisulfite, tannin, phosphate and an anti-foaming agent.

Virology Genome of BEFV BEFV forms a bullet- or cone-shaped virions that consist of a negative, single stranded RNA genome with a lipid envelope and 5 structural proteins. The envelope glycoprotein G contains type-specific and neutralizing antigenic sites. There has been recent evidence which demonstrated that BEFV induces apoptosis in several cell lines. It was however shown that apoptosis could be blocked by the caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), indicating that BEFV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in cultured cells.  Location  Countries in blue are where bovine ephemeral fever has been reported The virus has been found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and through eastern Australia. It is not found in the Americas, or in Europe (except western parts of Turkey).  Transmission  The virus is transmitted by an insect vector. The particular species linked to the virus are the biting midges Culicoides oxystoma and C. nipponensis.  Disease characteristics  Animal with BEF: hoisting the animal prevents loss of circulation and muscle damage. The characteristics of the disease are the sudden onset of fever, stiffness, lameness and nasal and ocular discharges. BEF often causes hypocalcaemia which in turn generates clinical signs such as depression, cessation of rumination, muscle tremors and constipation. Although the pathogenesis of the disease is complex it seems clear that the host inflammatory responses, mediated by the release of cytokines, are involved in the expression of the disease.  Diagnosis  The virus can be isolated from blood and can be identified by immunofluorescence and immunostaining. Rising levels of antibodies in two samples taken 2 to 4 weeks apart also indicate infection.  Treatment  Rest, and lack of stress, are important to aid recovery. Animals lying flat out on their side, unable to get up, should be rolled over several times each day to prevent loss of circulation and muscle damage. If the animal has signs of hypocalcemia, such as rumen stasis, then calcium borogluconate may be administered. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can improve recovery. Rest is absolutely imperative, for a minimum of one week or death can still occur.  Control  A vaccine is available in Japan but is very expensive which limits its use. Movement regulations are in place in several countries. Ultravac BEF (from Zoetis) - is a vaccine to prevent bovine ephemeral fever. The product is registered in Australia, Israel and Egypt.

All of their personal belongings, including cars and purses, were left behind. There were no signs of a struggle, except a broken porch light globe; there was also a message on the answering machine that police believe might have provided a clue about the disappearances, but it was inadvertently erased. In 1997, Robert Craig Cox, a convicted kidnapper and robber, claimed that he knew the women had been murdered and that their bodies would never be recovered. Neither their whereabouts nor their remains have been discovered. Victims Sherrill Elizabeth Levitt was age 47 at the time of her disappearance. She was , , with short light blonde hair, brown eyes and pierced ears. She was a cosmetologist at a local salon and a single mother, and was described as being very close to her daughter, Suzanne Elizabeth \\"Suzie\\" Streeter. Streeter was 19 years old, was , , with shoulder length blonde hair and brown eyes. Her distinguishable marks included a scar on her upper right forearm, a small mole on the left corner of her mouth, and pierced ears (left ear pierced twice). Stacy Kathleen McCall was age 18, was and , with long dark blonde hair and light colored eyes. Disappearance Streeter and McCall graduated from Kickapoo High School on June 6, 1992. They were last seen at around 2:00 a.m. on June 7, when they were leaving the last of the few graduation parties they had attended that evening. At some point during the night, they were also seen in Battlefield. The pair planned to spend the night at their friend Janelle Kirby's house, but when they decided Kirby's house was too crowded, they instead left to go to Streeter's (and thus Levitt's) home at 1717 East Delmar Street to retire for the night. It is assumed they arrived, because their clothing, jewelry, purses and vehicles were all present at the house the next day. Levitt was last heard from at approximately 11:15 p.m. on June 6 when she spoke with a friend on the phone about painting an armoire. The alleged timeline of the three is suspected to be convoluted, as the friends who last saw the girls the previous evening were also the first to arrive at the Levitt home the next day. The following morning around 9 a.m., Kirby and her boyfriend visited the house after Streeter and McCall failed to show up at her home; they had planned to spend the day at a water park, and were supposed to leave from Kirby's residence. Upon arriving, Kirby found the front door unlocked and entered the home, but found no sign of Streeter, McCall, or Levitt; each of the women's cars were parked outside. She also reported to police that the glass lamp shade on the porch light was shattered, though the lightbulb itself was intact. Kirby's boyfriend innocently helped her sweep the broken glass off the porch, which police later determined may have destroyed potential evidence. Inside the house, Kirby found Levitt and Streeter's dog, a Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon, who appeared agitated; while inside, Kirby also answered a \\"strange and disturbing call\\" from an unidentified male who made \\"sexual innuendos\\". She hung up and immediately received another call of a sexual nature, again hanging up the phone. Several hours later, McCall's mother, Janis, also visited the house after failed attempts to reach her daughter by phone. Inside, she noticed all three women's purses were sitting on the floor of the living room, and also saw her daughter's clothing neatly folded from the night before. Levitt and Streeter's cigarettes were also left inside the house. Janis frantically called police from the home's telephone to report the three women missing; after placing the call, while checking the phone's answering machine, she listened to a \\"strange message\\", but it was inadvertently erased from the tape. Police were \\"very interested\\" in the call and believed it \\"may have contained a clue\\". They also did not believe it was connected to the prank calls Kirby received. McCall's parents contacted police in reference to their daughter's disappearance from Levitt's home more than sixteen hours after the women were last seen, and other worried friends and family called and visited the home the following day. Police later estimated that the crime scene had been corrupted by ten to twenty people who visited Levitt's house. Upon the officers' arrival, the scene showed no signs of a struggle, except for the shattered porch light. Police also noted Levitt's bed had been slept in. All personal property was left behind including purses, money, cars, keys, cigarettes, and the family dog. Later developments On December 31, 1992, a man called the America's Most Wanted hotline with information about the women's disappearances, but the call was disconnected when the switchboard operator attempted to link up with Springfield investigators. Police said the caller had \\"prime knowledge of the abductions\\" and publicly appealed for the man to contact them, but he never did. Levitt and Streeter were declared legally dead in 1997. However, their case files are still officially filed under \\"missing\\". Investigators received a tip that the women's bodies were buried in the foundations of the south parking garage at Cox Hospital. In 2007, crime reporter Kathee Baird invited Rick Norland, a mechanical engineer, to scan a corner of the parking garage with ground-penetrating radar (GPR). Norland found three anomalies \\"roughly the same size\\" that he said were consistent with a \\"grave site location\\"; two of the anomalies were parallel, and the other was perpendicular. Police spokesperson Lisa Cox said that the person who reported the tip \\"provided no evidence or logical reasoning behind this theory at that time or since then.\\" She also said the parking garage began construction in September 1993, over a year after the disappearances. \\"Digging up the area and subsequently reconstructing this structure would be extremely costly, and without any reasonable belief that the bodies could be located here, it is illogical to do so, and for those reasons SPD does not intend to. Investigators have determined this lead to not be credible.\\" Darrell Moore, a former assistant at the Greene County Prosecutor's Office, said the tip came from someone who either \\"claimed to be a psychic or claimed to have a dream or vision about the case\\". Suspect In 1997, Robert Craig Cox, imprisoned in Texas as a convicted kidnapper and robber, and the suspect in a Florida murder, told journalists that he knew the three women had been murdered and buried and claimed their bodies would never be recovered. In 1992, Cox had been living in Springfield and, when interviewed then, had told investigators that he was with his girlfriend at church the morning after the women disappeared, which she corroborated. However, she later recanted her statement and said that Cox had asked her to say that. Cox also stated that he was at the home of his parents the night of the disappearance, and they confirmed that alibi. Authorities were uncertain if Cox was involved in the case or if he was seeking recognition for the alleged murders by issuing false statements. Cox stated to authorities and journalists he would disclose what happened to the three women after his mother died. In media The case remains unsolved as of November 2019, in spite of upward of 5,000 tips from the public. In June 1997, a bench was dedicated to the women inside the Victim's Memorial Garden in Springfield's Phelps Grove Park. The case has been featured on shows such as 48 Hours and America's Most Wanted. Investigation Discovery aired \\"The Springfield Three\\" on its Disappeared TV series.

Originally named Andrews Space & Technology, the company shortened its name in 2003 to Andrews Space. Over its life the company developed many unique technologies and space transportation architectures for the US Government (NASA, DARPA, others) and commercial customers. These include the Gryphon horizontal takeoff horizontal landing system using the \\"Alchemist\\" Air Collection and Enrichment System (ACES) as part of the NASA Space Launch Initiative. The Peregrine small launch vehicle was developed as part of the DARPA FALCON program and used a reusable first stage with expendable solid motor upper stages. In 2003 Andrews Space was one of four companies selected by NASA to study commercial cargo logistics to the International Space Station. This later lead to the NASA COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation System) program to fly cargo to the ISS commercially. Andrews Space was chosen in 2006 as one of six finalists for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, though they were not subsequently selected for funding the COTS R&D; by NASA. Andrews Space later supported Rocketplane Kistler's COTS effort. In 2010 and 2011 Andrews Space support Orbital's Cygnus COTS effort. In November 2010, Andrews Space was selected by NASA for consideration for potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts, and propulsion technologies. In 2011 Andrews Space was one of four companies selected by the US Air Force as part of its Rocket-back Booster System demonstrator program. As part of these awards the company was awarded a $250M IDIQ contract. In 2013 Andrews Space was awarded a contract by the US Army SMDC to build the Kestrel Eye 2 small imaging spacecraft. This was the result of a pivot by Andrews Space, begun in 2008, to move into space hardware production and very small spacecraft. While the Kestrel Eye 2 program was delayed and ultimately cancelled due to funding cuts as a result of Sequestration, much of the technology would make it to orbit as part of the BlackSky Pathfinder spacecraft, which was launched successfully in September 2016. From 2011-2013 Andrews Space developed and built the Cargo Module Power Unit for Orbital's Cygnus cargo delivery spacecraft. The CMPU was responsible for supplying power and managing power distribution to powered experiments inside the Cygnus spacecraft during their trip to the ISS. Andrews Space also licensed the magnetic torque rod design from Sinclair Interplanetary and produced many units which were used in a range of spacecraft, including those for the BlackSky Pathfinder / Global spacecraft, the Skybox Skysat spacecraft, as well as others. In 2015 Andrews Space was merged with Spaceflight, Inc. and BlackSky Global LLC and operated as Spaceflight Systems, a separate operating entity under the parent company of Spaceflight Industries.

The park is southwest of Carlinville, Illinois and is managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) as a public place for fishing. The state park centers on the Beaver Dam Lake, an artificial reservoir which was created by a private Carlinville fishing club in the 1890s. The club later became a private resort which catered to visitors who arrived via the adjacent Chicago and Alton Railroad. During the Great Depression, the resort failed. The state of Illinois purchased the lake and some adjacent property in 1947. Additional land purchases have created the present-day Beaver Dam State Park. The IDNR manages Beaver Dam Lake for the fishing of largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, and sunfish. In addition, the park offers opportunities for the hunting of deer, wild turkey, and small game. There is a power limit for boats using the Beaver Dam Lake reservoir, with no gasoline-powered motors allowed.

The distance between adjacent drivers is close enough that they constructively interfere with each other to send sound waves farther than traditional horn-loaded loudspeakers, and with a more evenly distributed sound output pattern. Line arrays can be oriented in any direction, but their primary use in public address is in vertical arrays which provide a very narrow vertical output pattern useful for focusing sound at audiences without wasting output energy on ceilings or empty air above the audience. A vertical line array displays a normally wide horizontal pattern useful for supplying sound to the majority of a concert audience. Horizontal line arrays, by contrast, have a very narrow horizontal output pattern and a tall vertical pattern. A row of subwoofers along the front edge of a concert stage can behave as a horizontal line array unless the signal supplied to them is adjusted (delayed, polarized, equalized) to shape the pattern otherwise. Loudspeakers can be designed to be arrayed horizontally without behaving as a horizontal line source.L-Acoustics Line Source Products Page; L-Acoustics Technical bulletin Modern line arrays use separate drivers for high-, mid- and low-frequency passbands. For the line source to work, the drivers in each passband need to be in a line. Therefore, each enclosure must be designed to rig together closely to form columns composed of high-, mid- and low-frequency speaker drivers. Increasing the number of drivers in each enclosure increases the frequency range and maximum sound pressure level, while adding additional boxes to the array will also lower the frequency in which the array achieves a directional dispersion pattern. The large format line array has become the standard for large concert venues and outdoor festivals, where such systems can be flown (rigged, suspended) from a structural beam, ground support towerGround support tower or off a tall A-frame truss tower. Since the enclosures rig together and hang from a single point, they are more convenient to assemble and cable than other methods of arraying loudspeakers. The lower portion of the line array is generally curved backward to increase dispersion at the bottom of the array and allow sound to reach more audience members. Typically, cabinets used in line arrays are trapezoidal, connected by specialized rigging hardware.SoundOnSound Live magazine, Issue 7, March 2006  History  Four-driver column loudspeaker polar patterns, taken at six frequencies The line array effect of the narrowing of the beam with increasing frequency was first demonstrated by acoustical pioneer Harry Olson.JBL's development team talks about line array concepts He published his findings in his 1957 text, Acoustical Engineering. Olson used line array concepts to develop the column speaker in which vertically aligned drivers in a single enclosure produced mid-range output in a wide horizontal and narrow vertical pattern. Line arrays have been around for over half a century but until recently most were voice range only. The application for these were for highly reverberant spaces where a narrow vertical design kept from exciting the reverberant field. A multi-band line array elements in a horizontally oriented enclosure was suggested by Joseph D'Appolito in 1983.JBL's development team talks about line array concepts. However, it was L-Acoustics' V-DOSC line array in the mid-1990s that would show the concert world that a more level and smoother frequency response can come from fewer boxes in a line array. As soon as people realized that there was no destructive interference in the horizontal plane and waves combine mostly in phase in the vertical plane, the race was on for loudspeaker manufacturers.  Theory  Pure line array theory is based on pure geometry and the thought experiment of the \\"free field\\" where sound is free to propagate free of environmental factors such as room reflections or temperature refraction. In the free field, sound which has its origin at a point (a point source) will be propagated equally in all directions as a sphere. Since the surface area of a sphere = 4œÄ r¬≤ where r is the radius, every doubling of the radius results in a four-fold increase in the sphere's surface area. The result of this is that the sound intensity quarters for every doubling of distance from the point source. Sound intensity is the acoustic power per unit area, and it decreases as the surface area increases since the acoustic power is spread over a greater area. The ratio between two acoustic pressures in deciBels is expressed by the equation dB = 20log(p1/p2), so for every doubling of distance from the point source p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, thus there is a sound pressure decrease of approximately 6 dB. A line source is a hypothetical one-dimensional source of sound, as opposed to the dimensionless point source. As a line source propagates sound equally in all directions in the free field, the sound propagates in the shape of a cylinder rather than a sphere. Since the surface area of the curved surface of a cylinder = 2œÄ r h, where r is the radius and h is the height, every doubling of the radius results in a doubling of the surface area, thus the sound intensity halves with each doubling of distance from the line source. Since p1 = 1 and p2 = 4 for every distance doubled, this results in a sound pressure decrease of approximately 3 dB.http://www.dbaudio.com/fileadmin/docbase/TI323_E.PDFEverest & Pohlmann (2009). \\"Master Handbook of Acoustics, Fifth Edition\\", McGraw-Hill, New York. In reality, dimensionless point sources and one-dimensional line sources cannot exist; however, calculations can be made based on these theoretical models for simplicity. Thus there is only a certain distance where a line source of a finite length will produce a sound pressure higher than an equally loud point source. Interference pattern is the term applied to the dispersion pattern of a line array. It means that when you stack a number of loudspeakers vertically, the vertical dispersion angle decreases because the individual drivers are out of phase with each other at listening positions off-axis in the vertical plane. The taller the stack is, the narrower the vertical dispersion will be and the higher the sensitivity will be on-axis. A vertical array of drivers will have the same horizontal polar pattern as a single driver. Other than the narrowing vertical coverage, the length of the array also plays a role in what wavelengths will be affected by this narrowing of dispersion. The longer the array, the lower frequency the pattern will control. At frequencies below 100 Hz (wavelength of 11.3 ft) the line array which is less than approximately 3 meter long will start to become omnidirectional, so the system will not conform to line array theory across all frequencies. Above about 400 Hz the driver cones themselves become directional, again violating the theory‚Äôs assumptions, and at high frequencies, many practical systems use directional waveguides whose behavior cannot be described using classical line array theory. In short, the geometry of real-world audio line arrays as used in public address systems can only be modeled approximately by line array theory, and only in the 100‚Äì400 Hz range.  High frequencies  Practical line array systems act as line sources only in the low- and mid- frequencies. For the high frequencies, some other method must be employed to attain directional characteristics that match those of the lows and mids. The most practical method for reinforcement systems is to use wave guides (horns) coupled to compression drivers. Each horn must have a very narrow vertical and a very wide horizontal dispersion. Rather than using constructive and destructive interference, horns achieve directionality by reflecting sound into a specified coverage pattern. In a properly designed line array system, that pattern should closely match the low-frequency directional characteristic of the array. If the array's vertical dispersion is 60 degrees and there are 12 boxes, then each horn would need to have 5 degree vertical coverage. (Narrow vertical coverage has the benefit that it minimizes multiple arrivals, which would harm intelligibility.) If this is achieved, then the wave guide elements can be integrated into the line array and, with proper equalization and crossovers, the beam from the high frequencies and the constructive interference of the low frequencies can be made to align so that the resulting arrayed system provides consistent coverage. Configurations Two configurations that are rarely used are the straight and curved array. The problem with curved arrays is that they are not very well suited to the average venue. While the bottom half will be angled down to provide extra coverage at locations close to the front of stage, the top half will be angled upwards at the ceiling. Also, the problem with straight line arrays is that the beam is far too narrow at high frequencies. A solution to utilise the best features of both arrays is to use a curvilinear or ‚ÄòJ‚Äô array. This is made up of a straight line portion and a curved portion, normally at the bottom. This provides a long throw straight line component for people relatively far away, while the curve at the bottom acts as an in-fill for the area underneath the array that would otherwise be neglected Spiral arrays are the next development from J-arrays, and have a superior frequency response due to their similar polar pattern at shifting frequencies, while still retaining the long throw and in-fill benefits that J-arrays provide. The concept is that spiral arrays are curved all the way along the array, but the curve is progressive. This means that the top of the array is almost straight with angles of 1¬∞ between boxes, and increases at the bottom to between 6¬∞ and about 10¬∞. A well designed spiral array could have an almost constant directivity pattern with frequency, with some small lobes exhibited at low frequencies.  Design and rigging  Two different line arrays rigged near a cluster of subwoofers Large-format line arrays are designed for large venues or outdoor festivals. These boxes typically included multiple vertically aligned high frequency compression drivers and multiple midrange and low drivers arranged symmetrically around the compression driver. The low frequency driver is typically 15 or 18 inches in diameter. Mid-format line arrays are typically two or three way and use 10 or 12 inch low-frequency drivers. The horizontal coverage is typically 90 degrees wide but some systems employ narrower boxes at the top or wider boxes at the bottom of the array. Using a transition frame (which aligns the rigging on dissimilar systems), system engineers may sometimes hang a mid-format box below a large-format box to cover the closest audience members. Speaker boxes from different manufacturers are not mixed because each system has a particular 'voicing' which may be common to a single manufacturer. Manufacturers typically provide a spreadsheet or custom program to design arrays. Examples include L-Acoustics SOUNDVISION, Adamson Shooter,Adamson Shooter software Electro-Voice LAPS (Line Array Prediction Software),Electro-Voice LAPS D&B; Audiotechnik ArrayCalc, and JBL Vertec Line Array Calculator. Renkus Heinz offers a program called EaseFocus. It is similar to EASE but has only features and calculations specific to Line arrays. EaseFocus has data for a large number of manufacturers allowing comparison of several loudspeaker systems. Other line array brands that use EaseFocus include Bose Professional, Community Professional Loudspeakers, Electro-Voice, QSC, RCF, and VUE Audiotechnik. Meyer Sound offers a different solution by providing an online system called MAPP Online Pro.Meyer Sound MAPP Online Pro Nexo offer their 3D modelling software, NS1. The design process starts by entering the dimensions of the room and the required sound pressure level. The program then suggests the number and arrangement of boxes. Alternatively some programs require the number of boxes entered and it will predict the resulting sound pressure levels in different parts of the room. Once designed, the rigging points are hung from the structure, followed by chain motors (or blocks), flying frame and then the speakers. The individual boxes may be connected one at a time or rigged together on the ground and then pulled up. As the array is lifted, individual box angles are adjusted to match the array prediction program. The top frame may have an inclinometer to confirm the angle of the frame or laser attached which indicates the upper aiming point of the array. If height or lack of rigging points does not permit flying the speakers, the speakers are typically stacked on the stage or on subwoofersEAW KF730 stack on SB730 using a custom stacking frame. Stacking of line arrays is common in smaller venues and in temporary installations. Compared to flown speakers, they require less vertical dispersion to cover front to back and the resulting array will have little curvature.

This was the first important public building in Britain to be designed by a female architect. Early life Scott was born in Bournemouth, England, one of ten children of Bernard Scott, a surgeon. She was a great-niece of the architects George Gilbert Scott and George Frederick Bodley and second cousin of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect of Liverpool Cathedral. She was educated at home until the age of fourteen, when she enrolled at the Redmoor School, Bournemouth. In 1919 she became one of the early students at the Architectural Association's new school in Bedford Square, London, graduating in 1924. Career Scott's first position was with the architects David Niven and Herbert Wigglesworth, a practice specialising in the Scandinavian style. In turn she became an assistant to Louis de Soissons, a progressive architect producing buildings in the contemporary style for the new garden city of Welwyn, Hertfordshire (where she worked on the design for the iconic Shredded Wheat Factory, now a listed building) and the modernist Oliver Hill. =Shakespeare Memorial Theatre= In 1927 a competition for a replacement to the burnt-out Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was announced and Scott entered, with a confidence in her own abilities taken from the sound theoretical grounding at the Architectural Association's school. At the time she was working for Maurice Chesterton's practice at Hampstead, London, and Chesterton agreed to oversee her proposals for feasibility. (Maurice Chesterton was a cousin of the theatre's publicist A. K. Chesterton.) Maurice Chesterton's daughter Elizabeth Chesterton, herself an architect, claimed in a late interview that the competition entry had been falsely \\"submitted under Scott's name\\", suggesting that all research into the practical requirements of theatre function had been her father's. Maurice Chesterton himself \\"disclaimed any personal share whatever in the successful design\\".Howard (2009) pages 186‚Äì190 Scott was assisted by two fellow AA students: Alison Sleigh and John Chiene Shepherd. On winning the competition (against seventy-one other entries) the four formed a partnership to prepare the detailed plans and supervise the construction. The reaction to Scott's design was mixed. The Manchester Guardian suggested that, although the design reflected the building's purpose, its bulk in the small town was \\"startling...monstrous [and] brutal.\\" The Times did not agree, noting how well the building \\"adapt[ed] itself to the lines of the river and landscape\\". Sir Edward Elgar, then 75, was to be the theatre's new musical director but, after visiting the building, he so was furiously angry with that \\"awful female\\" and her \\"unspeakably ugly and wrong\\" design that he would have nothing further to do with it, refusing even to go inside.Beauman (1982: 100), quoted in Stamp (2004) On the other hand, playwright George Bernard Shaw (a member the SMT committee notwithstanding his earlier telegram of congratulations to its chairman on having the unsuitable old building burnt down) was a firm supporter of Scott's design as the only one to show any theatrical sense. Scott herself acknowledged that in her design she had not intended to conceal the functionality of the building. Although most criticism was directed at the building's external form, in the auditorium the performers‚Äîalthough acknowledging that Scott had been at the mercy of her theatrical advisors: William Bridges-Adams, Barry Jackson and stage designer Norman Wilkinson (1882‚Äì1934, since 1920 a governor of the SMT)‚Äîfound that it was curiously difficult to connect with their audience: evidently the large, plain expanse of the cream-painted side walls had the effect of diffusing attention from the stage. Only in 1951, when the gallery seating was extended along the sides, was this overcome. However the building's lack of \\"meaningless decoration\\" was one of the features enthusiastically praised in the special June 1932 edition of the modernist Architectural Review.quoted in Mackintosh (1993) From today's viewpoint the theatre, now called the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, is regarded as a \\"nationally significant building\\" representing the \\"best modern municipal style of architecture\\". It was made a Grade II* listed building on 14 October 1980. =Later practice= Fawcett Building, Newnham College, Cambridge Scott was joined in the partnership by John Breakwell and‚Äîas John Shepherd and Alison Sleigh had married‚Äîthe practice became \\"Scott, Shepherd and Breakwell\\". None of their subsequent commissions had the prominence of the SMT, although their 1938 work on the Fawcett Building at Newnham College, Cambridge, is of note. In the Post-war period Scott returned to Bournemouth, working with the practice of Ronald Phillips & Partners. In the 1960s she joined the public sector, working for Bournemouth Borough Architect's Department on such projects as the new Pavilion Theatre on Bournemouth Pier. These relatively mundane schemes were no reflection of Scott's early talent; largely forgotten, she was \\"unable to live up to her perceived early promise\\". She retired in 1968. Feminism In 1924, when Scott entered practice, there were no prominent women architects and her selection for the project to rebuild the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre after it was destroyed by fire was only through her success in an international competition. Her achievement, and her decision to employ where possible women architects to assist her on the Stratford design, was instrumental in opening up the profession to women. Scott was not an outspoken feminist but was identified with the progressive movement to overturn traditional assumptions about women and the professions.Walker (1999: 244) She was by nature more of a quiet and practical feminist, ensuring that women were represented on her design projects and working through the Fawcett Society to promote wider acceptance. Above anything else, she disliked being labelled as a 'female architect' rather than simply an 'architect'. Elisabeth was a Soroptimist and an active member of Soroptimist International of Bournemouth. Family In 1936 she married George Richards. She died in Bournemouth on 19 June 1972. UK passport In November 2015 it was announced Elisabeth Scott would be one of only two prominent British women (the other being Ada Lovelace) to be featured in the design of the new UK passport, to be used for the next 5 years.

Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land (1876) is an epic poem by American writer Herman Melville, originally published in two volumes. It is a poetic fiction about an American young man named Clarel, on pilgrimage through the Holy Land with a cluster of companions who question each other as they pass through Biblical sites. Melville uses this situation to explore his own spiritual dilemma, his inability to either accept or reject inherited Christian doctrine in the face of Darwin's challenge, and to represent the general theological crisis in the Victorian era.Bezanson (1960), pp. ix-x. Clarel is perhaps the longest poem in American literature, stretching to almost 18,000 lines (longer even than European classics such as the Iliad, Aeneid and Paradise Lost). As well as for its great length, Clarel is notable for being the major work of Melville's later years. Critics at the time were baffled by its style, which is terse and philosophical, rather than the lyric and poetic style in his better known prose. But Melville has gradually gained a reputation as one of America's great nineteenth-century poets, and Clarel is now acclaimed alongside his fiction as one of his great works.Bloom, Harold. The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (1994). Plot =Part One: Jerusalem= Clarel, a young theology student whose belief has begun to waver, travels to Jerusalem to renew his faith in the sites and scenes of Jesus Christ's mortal ministry. He stays in a hostel run by Abdon, the Black Jew ‚Äî a living representation of Jerusalem. Clarel is initially amazed by the religious diversity of Jerusalem; he sees Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists walking its streets and recognizes their common faith in divinity. Clarel also senses a kinship with an Italian youth and Catholic doubter named Celio, whom he sees walking in the distance, but does not take the initiative and greet him. When Celio dies shortly thereafter, Clarel feels he may have passed up an opportunity to regain his faith. Gethsemane. While walking through Jerusalem's streets, Clarel meets Nehemiah, a Christian who hands out proselytizing tracts to pilgrims and tourists. Nehemiah becomes Clarel's guide and shows him the sights of Jerusalem. At the Wailing Wall, Clarel notices an American Jew and his daughter, whom he learns are Agar and Ruth. Nehemiah later introduces Clarel to Ruth, with whom he falls in love. But Jewish custom and a jealous rabbi keep Clarel and Ruth apart much of the time, so the student continues sightseeing with Nehemiah. In Gethsemane, Clarel meets Vine and Rolfe, two opposites. Rolfe is a Protestant and religious skeptic who historicizes Jerusalem and calls into question Christ's claim to divinity. Vine is a quiet man whose example leads Clarel to hope for faith ‚Äî at least initially. When Vine and Rolfe decide to take a tour of other important sites in the Holy Land ‚Äî the wilderness where John the Baptist preached, the monastery at Mar Saba and Bethlehem ‚Äî Clarel wants to accompany them, but he does not wish to leave Ruth. At this critical juncture, Ruth's father Nathan dies. Jewish customs prohibit Clarel's presence, so the student decides to take the journey, confident that he will see his beloved when he returns to Jerusalem. The night before his departure, he sees a frieze depicting the death of a young bride, which makes him pause with foreboding. He banishes his doubts and sets off on his pilgrimage. =Part Two: The Wilderness= Clarel travels with a wide range of fellow pilgrims ‚Äî Nehemiah, Rolfe and Vine accompany him, and Melville introduces new characters for this book: Djalea, son of an emir, turned tour guide; Belex, the leader of six armed guards protecting the pilgrimage; a Greek banker and his son-in-law Glaucon; a Lutheran minister named Derwent; an unnamed former elder who has lost the faith; and a Swedish Jew named Mortmain, whose black skull cap constantly forebodes ill. The tour through the desert starts with an explicit invitation to compare Clarel and his companions' journey to \\"brave Chaucer's\\" pilgrims to Canterbury. Unaccustomed to desert hardships, the banker and his son-in-law soon abandon the group for a caravan headed back to Jerusalem. When Clarel and his companions come to the stretch of road where Christ‚Äôs good Samaritan rescued a Jew from robbers, the taciturn elder also departs, scoffing at the cautions of Djalea and Belex, who fear robbers. Mortmain is the final deserter; he leaves before the party makes a stop at Jericho, refusing to enter a city he considers wicked. During their travels, Clarel's party is joined by Margoth, an apostate Jewish geologist who scoffs at the faith expressed by Derwent. Listening to Margoth's atheism prompts Rolfe to move closer to Derwent‚Äôs faith. The company also speaks briefly with a Dominican friar traveling through the desert. In the absence of these travelers, Derwent and Rolfe engage in a number of heated debates as to the veracity of biblical accounts and the relationship between the various Protestant sects. Derwent staunchly maintains his faith in biblical accuracy, while Rolfe questions the Holy Book‚Äôs basis as factual history even as he acknowledges his desire to believe. Clarel eagerly listens to these conversations but rarely participates, unsure of whether his faith is being shored up or torn down by the debates. He seeks Vine out for companionship, but Vine‚Äôs stoic silence resists interpretation, and Vine denies Clarel's request for more open talk. When the party arrives at the Dead Sea, they make camp, and are rejoined by Mortmain. Seeming disturbed, he drinks the salty Dead Sea water despite warnings that it is poisonous. Mortmain survives but, when the pilgrims wake in the morning, they discover that Nehemiah has died in the night. He saw a vision of John's heavenly city in the air, above the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah. While the company buries the man by the Dead Sea, Clarel looks out over the water. He sees a faint rainbow, which seems to offer hope as it did for Noah, but the bow \\"showed half spent ‚Äî/Hovered and trembled, paled away, and ‚Äî went\\". =Part Three: Mar Saba= Mar Saba in 1900. Clarel and the other pilgrims travel to the Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba, where one St. Saba discovered a fountain in the desert and planted a palm tree now more than one thousand years old. On their way to the monastery, they meet a young man from Cyprus who has just left Mar Saba and is traveling to the Dead Sea. The Cypriot's faith is unshaken, and all who hear his singing envy him. On their way to Mar Saba, the travelers pass through the \\"tents of Kedar\\", where a band of robbers camp and exact a toll of travelers to the monastery. These robbers recognize Arab royalty in Djalea, however, and let the pilgrims pass without molesting them. At Mar Saba, Clarel and his friends are fed by the monks and entertained with a masque portraying the story of Cataphilus, a wandering Jew. Hearing Cataphilus described as having lost his faith \\"and meriteth no ruth\\", Clarel thinks he resembles the Jew. The monks leave the group with Lesbos, a Muslim merchant visiting the monastery. Lesbos leads the group in a drunken revel, persuading even the staid Derwent to participate. He also introduces the group to Agath, another visitor at Mar Saba, a Greek sailor who was sent to Mar Saba to recover after being attacked in the Judean desert, similarly to the wounded Jew in Christ's parable of the Good Samaritan. Reminiscent of Melville's novels such as White-Jacket and Moby-Dick, Agath and Lesbos tell several sea stories to Clarel, who listens attentively to the tales. In conversations among the pilgrims and monks, Clarel learns that no one has faith‚Äînot Vine, Rolfe, Belex, Lesbos‚Äînor Derwent, whose professions until this point had been staunch. After confessing his lack of faith to Clarel, Derwent takes a tour of the monastery. He cannot appreciate the monks' faith; he scoffs at the holy relics showed him by the abbot, considers several of the monks to be insane, and cannot believe that the holy palm tree is either holy or a thousand years old. When he takes his eyes from the palm, Derwent sees Mortmain‚Äôs skull cap flutter down from an outcropping where the Jew is observing the palm. All of the pilgrims fall asleep looking at the palm tree. In the morning, when the caravan is about to leave, Mortmain is missing. They find him on the outcropping, his glassy, dead eyes fixed on the palm tree. The monks bury the Jew outside the monastery, in an unconsecrated grave, \\"Where vulture unto vulture calls, / And only ill things find a friend.\\" =Part Four: Bethlehem= When the pilgrims leave Mar Saba, they take Lesbos and Agath with them. After a short distance, Lesbos turns back and returns to the monastery, giving the pilgrims a military salute. Ungar, a new traveling companion, joins the company. A veteran of the American Civil War, he is descended from Catholic colonists and American Indians, and is the only one among them with faith. This new group travels to Bethlehem together. Once in Bethlehem, Agath leaves to join a new caravan. The remaining pilgrims pay Djaleal and Belex for their services in guiding them through the desert. Ungar‚Äôs faith attracts Clarel. Derwent is antagonized by his insistence that man is \\"fallen\\" and cannot reclaim his lost glory without divine aid. Their debates over human nature and religion reach to the morality of democracy and capitalism. Vine, Rolfe and Clarel, all Americans, take Ungar‚Äôs part, leaving the Englishman to believe that they argue with him out of prejudice against the Old World. In Bethlehem, the group is shown the cave where Christ was born by a young Franciscan friar named Salvaterra (save the earth in Italian). He seems almost divine to them, as if he were a reincarnation of St. Francis. The monk inspires Clarel‚Äôs faith. Clarel‚Äôs faith is strengthened after his time with Ungar and Salvaterra, and he views the setting sun as an inspiring beacon. Ungar leaves the group and Salvaterra remains in the monastery, leaving Clarel to grapple alone with his fledgling faith. He returns to Jerusalem hopeful, eager to rescue Ruth and Agar from their exile in Palestine, and return with them both to the United States. As Clarel approaches Jerusalem during the night before Ash Wednesday, he meets a Jewish burial party. In his absence, Ruth and Agar have died. His newfound faith is rocked to its depths. All through the rituals of Holy Week, Clarel waits for a miracle: for Ruth to return from the dead as Christ did. But Easter passes without Ruth‚Äôs resurrection. Clarel is left a lone man in Jerusalem, wondering why, though ‚ÄúThey wire the world‚Äîfar under sea / They talk; but never comes to me / A message from beneath the stone.‚Äù The last canto of Clarel, the epilogue, offers Melville‚Äôs commentary on the existential crisis of faith suffered by Clarel in the wake of Ruth‚Äôs death. Though Clarel remains beset by troubles and doubts, Melville offers the poem as an exordium to faith: > \\"Then keep thy heart, though yet but ill-resigned‚Äî > Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind; > That like the crocus budding through the snow‚Äî > That like a swimmer rising from the deep‚Äî > That like a burning secret which doth go > Even from the bosom that would hoard and keep; > Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming sea, > And prove that death but routs life into victory.\\" Origins Melville had visited the Holy Land in the winter of 1856 and traveled along the route he describes in Clarel. The visit immediately followed an October trip to England, where he had met his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was U.S. consul in Liverpool. Melville gave Hawthorne his manuscript for The Confidence-Man, which essentially amounted to his \\"farewell to prose\\". Hawthorne later recorded his concern about Melville, noting how they Herman Melville. > took a pretty long walk together, and sat down in the hollow among the sand > hills (sheltering ourselves from the high, cool wind) and smoked a cigar. > Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and > of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he had pretty > much made up his mind to be annihilated; but still he does not seem to rest > in that anticipation; and, I think, will never rest until he gets hold of a > definite belief. It is strange how he persists ‚Äî and has persisted ever > since I knew him, and probably long before ‚Äî in wandering to and fro over > these deserts, as dismal and monotonous as the sand hills amid which we were > sitting. He can neither believe, nor be comfortable in his unbelief; and he > is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other.Nathaniel > Hawthorne's Journal (1973), ed. C. E. Frazer Clarke Melville's record of the winter voyage of 1856 (15,000 miles for five months), now known as Journal of a Visit to Europe and the Levant, demonstrates that he did not leave behind his doubts or melancholy. Sailing through the Greek Islands, he became disillusioned with classical mythology. He was still in doubt following his time in Jerusalem. Passing Cyprus on the way home, he wrote: \\"From these waters rose Venus from the foam. Found it as hard to realize such a thing as to realize on Mt. Olivet that from there Christ rose\\" (p. 164). Melville explored the divide between the preternatural, the religious, and historical reality; he also was influenced by the crisis faced by mid‚àí19th-century Christianity in the wake of the discoveries of Charles Darwin. Melville saw these scientific developments as simultaneously fascinating (as in the focus on natural history in Moby-Dick) and terrifying, representing a challenge to traditional Christianity that was almost apocalyptic in its significance, especially when combined with the more theological attacks of Protestantism. As he writes in the troubled and inconclusive Epilogue to Clarel: > If Luther's day expand to Darwin's year, > Should that exclude the hope ‚Äî foreclose the fear? Structure The poem is composed in irregularly rhymed iambic tetrameter (except for the Epilogue), and contains 150 Cantos divided into four books: Jerusalem, The Wilderness, Mar Saba, and Bethlehem. Trying to determine the strange appeal of the work's \\"detuned poetic style\\", William C. Spengemann has suggested that the \\"impacted tetrameters of Clarel\\" reveal the origin of the \\"modernist note\\", and that they thus anticipate the \\"prosody of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams\\".William C. Spengeman, Introduction to Pierre, or The Ambiguities (1996), p. xviii Similarly, Walter E. Bezanson notes the \\"curious mixture of the archaic and the contemporary both in language and materials\\", leading to the inclusion of antique words such as \\"kern, scrip, carl, tilth and caitiff\\", alongside modern technical terms taken \\"from ship and factory, from the laboratory, from trading, seafaring, and war.\\" Commenting on the rhyme-scheme and the restricted meter, Bezanson responded to the common objection that Melville ought to have composed the work in prose, or at least in blank verse, arguing: > To wish that Clarel had been written in blank verse, for example, is simply > to wish for a completely different poem. In earlier years Melville had often > set Shakespearean rhythms echoing through his high-keyed prose with > extraordinary effect. But now the bravura mood was gone. Melville did not > propose a broad heroic drama in the Elizabethan manner. Pentameter -- > especially blank verse -- was too ample and overflowing for his present mood > and theme. The tragedy of modern man, as Melville now viewed it, was one of > constriction... Variations from the basic prosodic pattern are so infrequent > as to keep the movement along an insistently narrow corridor.Walter E. > Bezanson, Introduction to Clarel (New York: Hendricks House, 1960), pp. > lxvi-lxvii Reception =Contemporary= The poem was barely noticed on its original publication, and the few reviews that did appear showed that mainstream critical taste in the United States leant towards the polished, genteel lines of poets such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell. The New York Times was the first to insist that \\"it should have been written in prose\\", while the reviewer for the World complained that he had got \\"lost in the overwhelming tide of mediocrity\\". The Independent called it a \\"vast work... destitute of interest or metrical skill\\", and Lippincott's Magazine claimed that there were \\"not six lines of genuine poetry in it\\". In his collection of these quotes, Walter E. Bezanson suggests that the overwhelmingly negative response was partly due to the fact that none of the critics had \\"actually read it\\", noting in particular the Lippincott critic's baffling comment that the poet was evidently a \\"bright and genial\\" individual,Bezanson (1960), pp. xl-xli an observation entirely out of keeping with the tone of the vast majority of the work. Bezanson adds that Melville's \\"effort to cope with the major tensions of an age makes Clarel a historical document almost of the first order.\\" He concedes that present day readers may be \\"baffled\\" by the poetic style, but \\"[o]nce we face up to the idea that Melville's poetry is not an extension of the lyric vein of his famous novels,\\" we can accept that \\"essentially he was drawn to a non-lyrical, even harsh, prosodic line.Bezanson (1960), pp. xl-xli =Early 20th century= Subsequent criticism, especially since the so-called \\"Melville Revival\\" of the early-20s, has been more positive about the poem. Frank Jewett Mather called it \\"America's best example of Victorian faith-doubt literature\\", and Raymond Weaver declared that it contained \\"more irony, vividness and intellect than almost all the contemporary poets put together.\\" In 1924, amid the rising tide of literary modernism, the British critic John Middleton Murry approvingly noted the \\"compressed and craggy\\" quality of Melville's poetic line, and the French critic Jean Simon called the work \\"an extraordinary revelation of a tormented soul.\\" =Post-World War II= Seeing the whole work as an obscure elder sibling to T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, literary scholar Richard Chase has argued that the \\"sterility of modern life is the central symbolic idea of the poem\\", and that, after the \\"extremities of titanism in Pierre\\", Melville reached the culmination of his later thought: \\"the core of the high Promethean hero\\". These remarks paved the way for a generation of critics who saw the poem as the crucial document of Melville's later years, such as Ronald Mason, who reads the poem as \\"a contemplative recapitulation of all Melville's imaginative life\\", and Newton Arvin, who calls it \\"Melville's great novel of ideas in verse\\".Bezanson (1960), pp. xlvii-xlviii Melville's centennial epic is also his most direct commentary on the era of Reconstruction.Zach Hutchins, \\"Miscegenetic Melville: Race and Reconstruction in Clarel,\\" ELH 80.4 (2013): 1173-1203. In 1994, Harold Bloom chose Clarel as one of four Melville works to be included in his book The Western Canon.Bloom, Harold. The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (1994). The other Melville works Bloom included were Moby-Dick, The Piazza Tales and Billy Budd. References and further reading * Reprinted and slightly updated from the 1960 Hendricks House edition.

It is closely involved with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, with which it shares its chair, Sir Hugh Taylor, its strategy director and IT director. It is assumed that the two organisations will eventually merge. History The newly-formed King's Healthcare Trust took over management of the King's College Hospital in 1993. After being awarded foundation trust status, it became the King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in 2006. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England In March 2015 it had a very large backlog of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment. Monitor launched an investigation into the trust because of 'long standing problems' at Princess Royal University Hospital in March 2015. Financial problems are attributed to urgent improvements to the quality of care there, including increasing the nurse-to-patient ratio by recruiting 260 new nurses. In March 2018 it was the eleventh worst performer in A&E; in England, with only 61.8% of patients in the main A&E; seen within 4 hours. In February 2019 it had 331 patients waiting more than 52 weeks for treatment, mostly in orthopaedics and bariatric surgery, twice as many as any other trust in England. It plans to outsource some of the bariatric work to Princess Grace Hospital, run by HCA Healthcare and some to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. =Finance= The trust expected to finish 2015‚Äì16 with a deficit of more than ¬£65 million partly as a result of changes to the NHS tariff. It was said to be the least efficient hospital in England according to Lord Carter's review of NHS efficiency, with potential savings of ¬£154 million a year. In December 2017 it was placed in financial special measures and Lord Bob Kerslake, Chair of the trust, resigned. The organisation‚Äôs chief operating officer and finance director had resigned in November. The Chief Executive resigned in March 2018 at a point when the annual forecast deficit is expected to worsen to more than ¬£100 million. The trust is carrying underlying debts of more than ¬£600 million. It forecast a deficit of ¬£156 million for 2018-19 - the largest of any NHS trust. The chief executive, chair, finance director and chief operating officer all resigned in 2017-8. By March 2019 the projected deficit was around ¬£191 million. Commercial ventures The trust used its commercial arm, KCH Management, to open a clinic in Abu Dhabi in November 2014. It is working with investment management company Ashmore Group to set up a hospital in Dubai due to open in 2018. It has an agreement with Indo UK Healthcare Private to create an institute of health in New Chandigarh where a 500-bed hospital, trauma centre and day surgery centre will also be built. The trust will be paid by a fixed fee, profit share arrangements, equity stakes and consultancy work and hopes to generate ¬£40m over 15 years. The trust is a partner in Viapath a London-based provider of pathology services jointly owned with Serco, and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. In 2011 it was reported that the trust was paid around ¬£1m for the sale of NHS donor livers to overseas private patients. Controversy arose around this practice after a 2009 review by the Organ Donations Taskforce, commissioned by the UK government's Department of Health had already recommended a ban on the practice and stated that 'Financial gain from the transplant of donated organs feels morally wrong'. In 2016 the trust established a subsidiary company, King‚Äôs Interventional Facilities Management LLP, jointly owned by the trust and its subsidiary Kings Commercial Services Ltd, to which 99 estates and facilities staff were transferred. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits, as well as pay bill savings, by recruiting new staff on less expensive non-NHS contracts. VAT benefits arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services. The trust expanded its private patient unit from 21 to 46 beds in 2017. About 45% of the revenue comes from overseas, mainly from liver transplants. It sold its assisted conception unit to the Fetal Medicine Foundation and a company called King's Fertility for a total of ¬£26 million in June 2017. Kypros Nicolaides, a foetal medicine consultant at the trust, is a director of both organisations. In 2018-19 the trust wrote off overseas patient debts of ¬£4.3 million and British private patient debts of ¬£800,000. Its total private patient income was ¬£20.6 million. Tertiary care specialities It is one of the biggest provider of specialised services in England, which generated an income of ¬£308.8 million in 2014/5. King's Liver Unit is the most comprehensive service of its kind in the world, with a strong interest in paediatric liver cancers. King's also operates the largest liver transplantion programme in Europe. There is a great deal of expertise within King's Department of Neurology/Neurosciences. There is a large outpatient movement disorder clinic, specialising in multidisciplinary team management of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and related diseases. It is one of only five centres in the European Union designated a \\"Centre of Excellence\\" by the National Parkinson Foundation. In 1995 the hospital established the UK's first specialist Motor Neurone Disease Care & Research Centre, a model of care which has since been reproduced at other centres throughout the United Kingdom. The hospital is also home to the only dedicated diverticular disease clinic.

Similar to many other high-voltage-gated calcium channels, the Œ±1 subunit determines most of the channel's properties. The 'P' signifies cerebellar Purkinje cells, referring to the channel‚Äôs initial site of discovery. P-type calcium channels play a similar role to the N-type calcium channel in neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal and in neuronal integration in many neuronal types. History The calcium channel experiments that led to the discovery of P-type calcium channels were initially completed by Llin√°s and Sugimori in 1980. P type calcium channels were named in 1989 because they were discovered within mammalian Purkinje neurons. They were able to use an in vitro preparation to examine the ionic currents that account for Purkinje cells' electrophysiological properties. They found that there are calcium dependent action potentials which rise slowly and fall quickly then undergo hyperpolarization. The action potentials were voltage dependent and the afterhyperpolarizing potentials were connected to the spike bursts, located within the dendrites of the Purkinje cells. Without calcium flux in the Purkinje cells, action potentials fire sporadically at a high frequency. Basic features and structure P-type calcium channels are voltage dependent calcium channels that are classified under the high voltage activated class channel, along with L-, N-, Q- and R-type channels. These channels require a strong depolarization in order to be activated. They are found at axon terminals, as well as in somatodendritic areas of neurons within the central and peripheral nervous system. P-type calcium channels are also critical to vesicle release, specifically neurotransmitters and hormones at synaptic terminals of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Voltage gated P-type calcium channels consist of a main pore-forming Œ±1 subunit (which is more specifically referred to as CaV2.1), an Œ±2 subunit and a Œ≤ subunit. There can be Œ≥ subunits found in calcium channels of skeletal muscles. The Œ±1 subunit is encoded specifically by the CACNA1A gene and is composed of four domains, each containing six transmembrane (S1-S6) spanning Œ± helices. The S1-S2 loop and the S6 region are thought to be responsible for the channel's inactivation, the S4 region serves as the voltage sensor and S5-S6 loop forms the pore. There are seven subunits within the Œ±1 subunit. The A subunit, called Œ±1ACa2+, corresponds to what is functionally defined as the P-type and Q-type isoforms. P-type and Q-type calcium channels are closely related as they are produced from the same gene via alternative splicing. As a complication of the alternative splicing, P-type and Q-type channels may have different subunit compositions. The Œ≤ subunit regulates the kinetics and expression of the channel, along with the Œ±2Œ¥ subunit. Channel distribution Stained purkinje cell from a human cerebellum. High density of P type calcium channels found on the dendrites.The majority of P-type calcium channels are located in the nervous system and heart. Antibody labeling is the primary method used to identify channel location. Areas of high expression in mammalian systems include: * Purkinje cell dendrites * Smooth endoplasmic reticulum * Plasma membrane of the soma (cell body) * Periglomerular cells in the Olfactory bulb * Cerebellar cortex * Neurons in the brainstem, entorhinal and pyriform cortices, and the habenula. Channel blockers P-type calcium channel blockers act to impede the flow of calcium. The blocking of calcium currents may cause the organism to experience impaired functioning and viability. These effects can lead to various diseases which are described in more detail in the section below. The pore of P-type calcium channels are sensitive to compounds that can be divided into three groups: # Peptide ion channel blockers # Low molecular weight compounds # Therapeutics There are only two peptide toxins that selectively block P-type channels: œâ-agatoxin IVA and œâ-agatoxin IVB. The other blockers mentioned, such as the low molecular weight and therapeutic blockers, are nonselective. This means they act can act on P-type channels as well as other channels. = Selective peptide toxin œâ-agatoxin = Venom of the Agelenopsis spider is a specific P-type calcium channel blocker The two known blockers which are specific to P-type calcium channels are peptides derived from the spider venom of Agelenopsis aperta. The toxins from this venom which show selectivity for P-type channels are œâ-agatoxin IVA and œâ-agatoxin IVB. Each of these peptide toxins are made of 48 amino acids which are bound by four disulfide bonds. Although œâ-agatoxin IVA and œâ-agatoxin IVB have the same affinity and selectivity for P-type channels, their kinetics are different. The œâ-agatoxin IVA effects the gating mechanism of the P-type channel. When there is a strong depolarization to activate the channel, œâ-agatoxin IVA can no longer block the channel. Therefore, œâ-agatoxin IVA has a very low affinity for the channel when it is open. It binds to the Œ±1A subunit on the outside of the pore. The œâ-agatoxin IVA receptor on the P-type channel is located at the S3-S4 linker. On the other hand, channel blocking by œâ-agatoxin IVB occurs much more slowly. Yet, similar to œâ-agatoxin IVA, œâ-agatoxin IVB cannot bind to the channel upon a strong depolarization. = Non-selective peptide toxins = * œâ-Grammotoxin SIA is a peptide toxin derived from the venom of the spider Grammostola spatulata. It acts to modify the P-type channel gating. * œâ-PnTx3-3, PnTx3-3, and phonetoxin IIA are all toxins from the spider Phonoetrica nigriventer which act to block the current through the P-type calcium channels. * DW13.3 is a peptide toxin from the spider Filistata hibernalis and it is composed of 74 amino acids. It also functions to block the current through P-type calcium channels. * œâ-Conotoxins are derived from the venom of cone snails. œâ-Conotoxin MVIIC acts within the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons to block the P-type channels. Also, within the hippocampal CA3 neurons, this toxin blocks synaptic transmission. Its effects are slow. * Calcicludine is from venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps, which is a green mamba. It has the ability to voltage-dependently block P-type channels. * Kurotoxin is from venom of the scorpion Parabuthus. In neurons in the thalamus, kurtoxin decreases high threshold calcium currents, however, in the Purkinje cells, it increases the calcium currents. = Low molecular weight P-type channel blockers = Low molecular weight channel blockers have advantages over peptide blockers in drug development. One advantage of low molecular weight channel blockers is that they can penetrate tissue, which is important for crossing the blood- brain barrier. There is no specific low molecular weight channel blocker for P-type channels. However, there are a number of these blocker compounds which can effect the activity of the P-type channels. These include: * Roscovitine is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase. It increases the current of calcium in neostriatal interneurons by slowing the deactivation of the channel. Also, roscovitine can either act as an agonist or antagonist for the P-type calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane. * Isoprenaline is a Œ≤-adrenoceptor agonist and it causes an increase in P-type calcium channel current. Isoprenaline acts through a cAMP signaling pathway. * Eliprodil and antazoline are NMDA receptor antagonists and act to block P-type channels. Eliprodil can decrease P-type channel currents in the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. * Dodecylamine can only block P-type channels when they are in the open state. * Ethanol can block P-type channels when at a high enough concentration. The blocking of the P-type channels could be the reason for ataxia when drinking alcohol. = Therapeutics = There are therapeutics used clinically which can effect the activity of P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist which is used to treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the \\"cacna1a\\" gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.

Neurotransmitter re-uptake pump There are a number of neurological diseases that have been attributed to malfunctioning or mutated P/Q type channels. =Alzheimer's disease= In Alzheimer Disease, there is a progressive accumulation of Œ≤-amyloid protein (AŒ≤) in brain. Amyloid plaques develop which result in the key symptoms of Alzheimer Disease. AŒ≤ globulomer protein is an artificial substance used in research experiments that has similar properties to AŒ≤ oligomer which is present in the body. AŒ≤ oligomer directly regulates P/Q type calcium channels. The Œ±1A subunit is the responsible for the conduction of calcium current. When only P/Q type calcium channels are present with AŒ≤ globulomer protein, there is a direct effect on the Œ±1A subunit and results in an increased calcium current through the P/Q type calcium channel. The response is dose dependent as concentrations of 20nM and 200nM of AŒ≤ globulomer are necessary for significant increase of calcium current through channel in Xenopus oocytes, showing that a certain buildup of AŒ≤ globulomer is necessary before the effects are seen. When the calcium current is increased, neurotransmitter release also rises, offering a possible cause for the toxicity in Alzheimer Disease patients. =Migraine headaches= The CACNA1A gene codes for the alpha subunit of the P/Q type calcium channel. The R192Q mutation of the CACNA1A gene is a gain of function mutation for P2X3 receptors. P2X3 receptors are present in trigeminal ganglion neurons and are believed to be a main contributor to familial hemiplegic migraine. By using a knockin experiment, this mutation could be expressed in mice so research could be conducted. The mutant mouse has a significantly higher P2X3 receptor activity than the wild type mouse due to increased channel open probability and channel activation at lower voltages. This increased receptor activity results in a higher flux of calcium through the P/Q type calcium channel. The increased intracellular calcium concentration may contribute to the acute trigeminal pain that typically results in a headache. Evidence supports that migraines are a disorder of brain excitability characterized by deficient regulation of the cortical excitatory‚Äìinhibitory balance. =Seizures= Levetiracetam is an anti-epileptic drug than can be used to treat partial and generalized seizures. Levetiracetam inhibits P/Q channel-mediated glutamate release and decreases the excitatory post synaptic currents of both AMPA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, specifically the dentate gyrus, which is known to propagate seizure activities. The inhibition of glutamate release results in an anti-epileptic response in patients because it decreases the excitatory postsynaptic current. There are many different types of calcium channels, so to prove that the P/Q type calcium channels are directly involved, a P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor, omega-agatoxin TK, was used to block the channel. When blocked, patients no longer benefited from the anti-epileptic effects from the drugs. When blockers for L type and N type calcium channels were used, the effects of Levetiracetam were still seen. This is strong evidence that the P/Q type calcium channels are involved in the Levetiracetam treatment which allow for relief from seizures. Mutation studies Many P-type calcium channels mutations result in a decreased level of intracellular free calcium. Maintaining calcium homeostasis is essential for normally functioning neurons. Changing the cellular calcium ion concentration acts as a trigger for multiple diseases, in severe cases these diseases can result in mass neuronal death. Mutation studies allow experimenters to study genetically inherited channelopathies. A channelopathy is any disease that results from an ion channel with malfunctioning subunits or regulatory proteins. One example of a P-type calcium channel channelopathy is shown in homozygous ataxic mice, who are recessive for both the tottering and leaner genes. These mice present with mutations in the alpha1A subunit of their P/Q type channels. Mutations in these channels result in deficiencies within the cerebellar Purkinje cells that dramatically reduce the channels current density. The tottering mutations within mice result from a missense mutation and causes delayed-onset of seizures and ataxia. The tottering mutation substitutes a single proline instead of a leucine within the P-region of the channel. The P-region is responsible for the formation of the ion channel pore. The leaner mutation, which results in more severe symptoms than the tottering mutation, has been shown to result from a single nucleotide substitution that causes splicing failures within the channels open reading frame. Mutations in the pore forming subunit of P type calcium channels cause ataxia, severely altered respiration, by decreasing minute ventilation and producing symptoms associated with atelectasis. Mutations to CaV2.1 have also been shown to affect transmission within the pre-B√∂tzinger Complex, a cluster of interneurons in the brainstem which help to regulate breathing.

(Catterall WA, Perez-Reyes E, Snutch TP, Striessnig J. Voltage-gated calcium channels (version 2019.4) in the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology Database. IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology CITE. 2019; 2019(4). Available from: https://doi.org/10.2218/gtopdb/F80/2019.4.) The calcium N-channel consists of several subunits: the primary subunit Œ±1B and the auxiliary subunits Œ±2Œ¥ and Œ≤. The Œ±1B subunit forms the pore through which the calcium enters and helps to determine most of the channel's properties. These channels play an important role in the neurotransmission during development. In adult neurous system, N-type calcium channels are critically involved in the release of neurotransmitters, and in pain pathways. N-type calcium channels are the target of ziconotide, the drug prescribed to relieve intractable cancer pain. There are many known N-type calcium channel blockers that function to inhibit channel activity, although the most notable blockers are œâ-conotoxins. Crystal Structure of N-Type Channel  Structure  N-type calcium channels are categorized as high threshold-activated channels and seen in the Cav2 gene family. The structure of the N-type calcium channel is very similar to other voltage-dependent channels. The most important part of the channel is the actual pore that is formed by the Œ±1B subunit. This pore is the location of the import of the extracellular ions. The Œ±1B subunit has as many as 2000 amino acid residues within an amino acid sequence with the transmembrane structure with a pore. This is organized into 6 six segments(S1-S6). S1, S2, S3, S5, and S6 are hydrophobic while S4 serves as the voltage-sensor. In addition there is a membrane-associated loop in between S5 and S6. The activity of the pore is modulated by 4 subunits: an intracellular Œ≤-subunit, a transmembrane gamma subunit, and complex of alpha-2 and delta subunits. In addition to the Œ±1B subunit encoded by CACNA1B gene, the following auxiliary subunits are present in the N-type calcium channel: * Œ±2Œ¥ ‚Äì encoded by either one of two genes CACNA2D1, CACNA2D2 * Œ≤ ‚Äì encoded by either one of four genes CACNB1, CACNB2, CACNB3, CACNB4  Function  N-type calcium channels are important in neurotransmitter release because they are localized at the synaptic terminals. In the peripheral nervous system, N-type channels are known to be involved in the release of many neurotransmitters like glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine. When extracellular calcium flows into N-type calcium channels due to an action potential, it triggers the fusion of the secretory vesicles. Studies on the cardiovascular system reveal when œâ-Conotoxin is introduced, it causes the inhibition of norepinephrine, and this shows that only the N-type calcium channel, not the P/Q/L type calcium channels, are involved in the release of norepinephrine. In the kidneys, blocking of N-type calcium channels reduce glomerular pressure through dilation of arterioles. N-type calcium channels have been shown to play a part in the localization of neurite growth in the sympathetic nervous system and the skin and spinal cord. The neurite outgrowth was shown to be inhibited through an interaction between laminin and the 11th loop of the n-type calcium channel structure. It has been suggested that neurites outgrowth is inhibited by the influx of calcium through the growth cone, and this happens when the Cav2.2 channel comes in contact with laminin 2, and in response can induce a stretch activation of the N-type calcium channel.  Blockers  Ziconotide 1DW5In the pain pathway, N-type calcium channels serve to regulate pain signals sent from the peripheral nervous system to Central Nervous System. Although many N-type calcium channels blockers are known, most potent and selective belong to the family of conotoxins.

Loss-of-function CACNA1B mutations were found to be present in progressive epilepsy-dyskinesia.  Clinical significance  The alteration of N-type calcium channels in therapeutic processes occurs in four major ways; through the blockage of N-type calcium channel peptides, interference of the flow of ions through the channel itself, activation of G-protein coupled signaling, and interference of the G-protein pathways. Studies have shown that the intrathecal injection of the calcium channel inhibitor ziconotide, to block the N-type calcium channels, have produced alleviation of intractable pain. Blockade of the N-type calcium channel is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholism. Because prolonged alcohol exposure over time has been known to increase N-type channel function, experiments have shown that using N-type antagonists to decrease channel activity resulted in reduced voluntary consumption of alcohol in mice.

Marked immunoreactivity was detected in the zona glomerulosa. In the figure: ZG = zona glomerulosa, ZF = zona fasciculata, AC = adrenal capsule. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to published methods. An L-type calcium channel with its subunits labeled along with some drugs known to inhibit the channel. The L-type calcium channel (also known as the dihydropyridine channel, or DHP channel) is part of the high-voltage activated family of voltage-dependent calcium channel. \\"L\\" stands for long- lasting referring to the length of activation. This channel has four subunits (Cav1.1, Cav1.2, Cav1.3, Cav1.4). L-type calcium channels are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, cardiac muscle, and for aldosterone secretion in endocrine cells of the adrenal cortex. They are also found in neurons, and with the help of L-type calcium channels in endocrine cells, they regulate neurohormones and neurotransmitters. They have also been seen to play a role in gene expression, mRNA stability, neuronal survival, ischemic-induced axonal injury, synaptic efficacy, and both activation and deactivation of other ion channels. In cardiac myocytes, the L-type calcium channel passes inward Ca2+ current and triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by activating ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) (calcium-induced-calcium-release). Phosphorylation of these channels increases their permeability to calcium and increases the contractility of their respective cardiac myocytes. L-type calcium channel blocker drugs are used as cardiac antiarrhythmics or antihypertensives, depending on whether the drugs have higher affinity for the heart (the phenylalkylamines, like verapamil), or for the blood vessels (the dihydropyridines, like nifedipine). In skeletal muscle, there is a very high concentration of L-type calcium channels, situated in the T-tubules. Muscle depolarization results in large gating currents, but anomalously low calcium flux, which is now explained by the very slow activation of the ionic currents. For this reason, little or no Ca2+ passes across the T-tubule membrane during a single action potential.  History  In 1953, Paul Fatt and Bernard Katz discovered voltage gated calcium channels in crustacean muscle. The channels exhibited different activation voltages and calcium conducting properties and were thus separated into High Voltage Activating channels (HVA) and Low Voltage Activating channels (LVA). After further experimentation, it was found that HVA channels would open to 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHPs). Using DHPs, they found that HVA channels were specific to certain tissues and reacted differently, which led to further categorization of the HVA channels into L-type, P-type, and N-type. L-type calcium channels were peptide sequenced and it was found that there were 4 kinds of L-type calcium channels: Œ±1S (Skeletal Muscle), Œ±1C (Cardiac), Œ±1 D (found in the brain), and Œ±1F (found in the retina). In 2000, after more research was done on Œ±1 subunits in voltage-gated calcium channels, a new nomenclature was used that called L-type calcium channels CaV1 with its subunits being called CaV1.1, CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and CaV1.4. Research on the CaV1 subunits continues to reveal more about their structure, function, and pharmaceutical applications.  Structure  L-type Calcium Channels contain 5 different subunits, the Œ±1(170‚Äì240 kDa), Œ±2(150kDa), Œ¥(17-25 kDa), Œ≤(50-78 kDa), and Œ≥(32 kDa) subunits. The Œ±2, Œ¥, and Œ≤ subunits are non-covalently bonded to the Œ±1 subunit and modulate ion trafficking and biophysical properties of the Œ±1 subunit. The Œ±2 and Œ¥ subunits are in the extracellular space while the Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits are located in the cytosolic space. The Œ±1 subunit is a heterotetramer that has four transmembrane regions, known as Domains I-IV, that cross the plasma six times as Œ±-helices, being called S0-S6 (S0 and S1 together cross the membrane once). The Œ±1 subunit as a whole contains the voltage sensing domain, the conduction pore, and gating apparatus. Like most voltage-gated ion channels, the Œ±-subunit is composed of 4 subunits. Each subunit is formed by 6 alpha-helical, transmembrane domains that cross the membrane (numbered S1-S6). The S1-S4 subunits make up the voltage sensor, while S5-S6 subunits make up the selectivity filter. To sense the cell's voltage, the S1-S3 helices contain many negatively charged amino acids amino acids while S4 helices contain mostly positively charged amino acids with a P-loop connecting the S4 to S5 helices. After the S1-6 domains, there are six C domains that consist of two EF-hand motifs (C1-2 and C3-4) and a Pre-IQ domain (C5) and IQ domain (C6). There are also two EF-hand motifs on the N-terminus. Both the N and C terminus are in the cytosolic space with the C-terminus being much longer than the N-terminus. The Œ≤ subunit is known to have four isoforms (Œ≤1-Œ≤4) to regulate the channel's functions and is connected to Œ±1 through the Œ±1 I and II linker in the cytosol at the Œ≤ Œ±1-binding pocket (ABP). Each isoform contains a src homology 3 domain (SH3) and a guanylate-kinase like domian (GK) that are separated by a HOOK domain, and three unstructured regions. The Œ±2 and Œ¥ subunits are connected together by disulfide bonds (sometimes known as the Œ±2Œ¥ subunit) and interact with Œ±1. they have four known isoforms called Œ±2Œ¥-1 to Œ±2Œ¥-2 and contain contain a von Willebrand A (VWA) domain and a Cache domain. The Œ±2 region is in the extracellular space while the Œ¥ region is in the cell membrane and have been seen to be anchored with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The Œ≥ subunit has eight isoforms (Œ≥1-Œ≥8) and is connected to the Œ±1 subunit and has only been found in muscle cells in the CaV1.1 and CaV1.2 channels. Not much is known about the Œ≥ subunit, but it has been linked to interactions in hydrophobic forces.  Mechanism  Opening of the pore in L-type calcium channels takes place in the Œ±1 subunit. When the membrane depolarizes, the S4 helix moves through the S4 and S5 linkers to the cytoplasmic ends of the S5 and S6 helices. This opens the activation gate which is formed by the inner side of the S6 helices in the Œ±1 subunit. The most predominant way of autoinhibition of L-type calcium channels is with the Ca+2/Cam complex. As the pore opens and causes an influx of Calcium, calcium binds to calmodulin and then interacts with the loop that connects the adjacent EF-hand motifs and causes a conformational change in the EF-hand motif so it interacts with the pore to cause quick inhibition in the channel. It is still debated on where and how the pore and EF-hand interact. Hydrophobic pockets in the Ca+2/Cam complex will also bind to three sections of the IQ domain known as the ‚Äúaromatic anchors‚Äù. The CA+2/Cam complex has a high affinity towards L-type calcium channels, allowing it to get blocked even when there are low amounts of calcium present in the cell. The pore eventually closes as the cell repolarizes and causes a conformational change in the channel to put it in the closed conformation.  Inhibition and modulation  One of the most recognized characteristics of the L-type calcium channel is its unique sensitivity to 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs). Unlike other voltage gated calcium channels, L-type calcium channels are resistant to ‚çµ-CT X (GVIA) and ‚çµ-AG A (IVA) inhibitory drugs. A well observed form of modulation is due to alternative splicing. A common form of modulation from alternative splicing is the C-terminal modulator (CTM). It has a positively charged Œ±-helix on the C-terminal called the DCRD and a negatively charged helix right after the IQ motif (CaM interaction site) called the PCRD. The two helices can form a structure that bind competitively with CaM to reduce the open-state probability and lower calcium-dependent inhibition (CDI). Alternative splicing is also seen on the Œ≤ subunits to create different isoforms to give channels different properties due to palmitoylation and RNA editing. Other forms of modulation on the Œ≤ subunit include increasing or decreasing of the subunit's expression. This is due to the fact that Œ≤ subunits increase the open- probability of the channel, activity in the plasma membrane, and antagonize the ubiquitination of the channel. L-type calcium channels are also modulated by G protein-coupled receptors and the adrenergic nervous system. Protein Kinase A (PKA) activated by a G protein-coupled receptors cascade can phosphorylate L-type calcium channels, after channels form a signaling complex with A-Kinase-Anchoring proteins (AKAPs) , to increase calcium current through the channel, increasing the open-state probability, and an accelerated recovery period. Activated Phospholipase C (PLC) from G protein-coupled receptors can breakdown polyphosphoinositides to decrease the channels calcium current by 20%-30%. The adrenergic nervous system has been seen to modulate L-type calcium channels by cleaving the C-terminal fragment when the Œ≤-adrenergic receptor is stimulated to increase activation of the channels.Alpha subunit of a generic voltage-gated ion channel Genes * , , ,  See also  * CACNA1C * CACNA1D * CACNA1S * CACNA1F  References   Further reading  *  External links  Ion channels Electrophysiology Membrane biology Integral membrane proteins Calcium channels ","title":"L-type calcium channel"},{"id":"9773361","text":"Gone Dau is an East Fijian language spoken by about 700 people on the islands of Gone and Dau, Fiji.

The architecture of the 11 Georgian townhouses mean that each room is distinctly different from another. In 1889, the hotel was unified with the neighbouring St George's Hotel, as they backed onto each other and were eventually merged to allow for a throughway between Dover Street and Albemarle Street. Historian John Lothrop Motley stayed at the hotel in 1874, as shown in a letter he wrote on 17 June that year, to Dutch historian Groen van Prinsterer.Nationaal Archief (National Archives), The Hague, Collection 043 Groen van Prinsterer, 1810‚Äì1876, access number 2.21.006.43, inventory number 124 Celebrated Victorian writers Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, JM Barrie and Bram Stoker were also all regular visitors. The hotel was the location of the first successful telephone call in Europe, made by Alexander Graham Bell on a phone which can be seen in the hotel today. The hotel has also hosted Theodore Roosevelt; Napoleon III; Empress Eugenie; Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians; Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia; George II, King of the Hellenes; Cecil Rhodes; Rudyard Kipling; Agatha Christie; and Stephen King. While Brown's has been described as the inspiration hotel for Christie's At Bertram's Hotel, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says Christie's model was a different Mayfair hotel, Fleming's. The hotel came under the management of Rocco Forte Hotels on 3 July 2003, having once been operated by Raffles International Hotels. During 2004‚Äì2005, the hotel underwent a ¬£24 million refurbishment and re-opened in December 2005. Interior Brown's Hotel is noted for its traditional English Victorian sophistication fused with a contemporary feel. The bedrooms are designed by Olga Polizzi and combine modern features with traditional furnishing and are all individually decorated. The standard rooms are 30 to 50 square metres in size, with the suites being 60 to 168 square metres. The hotel has several restaurants and bars including Beck at Brown's (formerly The Albemarle then HIX Mayfair), an √† la carte restaurant which serves seasonal Italo-British cuisine, The Brown's English Tea Room which has served afternoon tea and light snacks since the mid-nineteenth century, and The Donovan Bar, named after the British photographer Terence Donovan. The bar is lined with over 50 of his black and white prints. The bar is furnished with wooden floors, black leather seating and dark country check banquettes. In one corner are \\"naughty\\" adult- oriented photographs and a table for 12. The bar serves over sixty cocktails and thirty wines and Champagnes. The hotel has six private dining and meeting rooms, which can accommodate up to 72 guests for a lunch or dinner or up to 120 people for a reception.

Cambridge / Boston ‚Äì New York, The Riverside Press / Houghton Mifflin 1912 Early years Letchworth was born in Brownville, New York on May 26, 1823, the fourth of eight children born to Josiah and Ann Hance Letchworth. Raised as a Quaker, Letchworth learned the values of hard work, charity, and development of the intellect from his family. At age 15, Letchworth was hired as a clerk at Hayden & Holmes, a saddlery and hardware company. Letchworth succeeded at his tasks and in business in general, and by age 22 was a partner at Pratt & Letchworth, a company involved in the \\"malleable iron\\" business.  Glen Iris Estate  Although successful, Letchworth found the day-to-day operations of business burdensome. He sought refuge from the business world and decided to build a retreat estate. He settled on a location in former Seneca territory in western New York. The Seneca people were pushed out of the area following the American Revolutionary War, as they had been allies of the defeated British. As a tourist, Letchworth visited the Sehgahunda Valley of the Genesee River in western New York. In 1859 he purchased his first tract of land near Portage Falls. Letchworth hired noted landscape architect William Webster to design the grounds of the estate, and named it Glen Iris. In 1906 he bequeathed his estate to New York state. It now makes up the heart of Letchworth State Park. Charity and social work In 1873, Letchworth was appointed to the New York State Board of Charities. \\"In 1875, he had inspected all the orphan asylums, poor-houses, city alms houses, and juvenile reformatories in the state which had an aggregate population of 17,791 children.\\" Following his investigation, he recommended that all children under 2 years of age be removed from these institutions, which was accepted by the state. In 1878, Letchworth was elected as President of the Board. Letchworth resigned from the State Board of Charities in 1897. Letchworth spent the next few years traveling around Europe and the United States at his own expense to explore the treatment and condition of the insane, epileptics and poor children. From this research, he wrote two books: The Insane in Foreign Countries and Care and Treatment of Epileptics.Letchworth WP. Care and Treatment of Epileptics. New York ‚Äì London, G. P. Putnam‚Äôs Sons 1900 Many of his recommendations were later adopted by Craig Colony, a state epileptic hospital which he helped to establish in Western New York in 1896. Letchworth served as President of the National Association for the Study of Epilepsy and the Care of Treatment of Epilepsy, and edited the Proceedings of its first Annual MeetingLetchworth WP, ed.

Buffalo, New York, C. E. Brinkworth 1901 Letchworth Village in Thiells, New York was also named for Letchworth. In addition, he was President of the First New York State Conference of Charities and Corrections, as well as President of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, held in St. Louis in 1884.

Small is a cultural anthropologist, with a Ph.D. from Temple University, and a professor and graduate coordinator of anthropology at Northern Arizona University. She has written under the pen name of Rebekah Nathan. During a leave of absence from teaching, during the fall of 2002 at the age of 52 she enrolled as a student at Northern Arizona University, signing up for a standard first year range of courses. After teaching for more than fifteen years, she realized that she no longer understood the behavior and attitudes of her students, as fewer of them participated in class discussions or discussed problems during her office hours. Her contributions to anthropology have focused on understanding long-term social change including the rise and fall of social institutions, the long-term implications of social structures, and the processes by which culture changes. Her work is characterized by a critical empathetic feminism, reflexivity, and a creative re-adaptation of focus: From Tonga to computer simulations of gender in Polynesian hierarchies, to U.S. college life. In 1997, Dr. Cathy Small was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for 1998 and 1999 to model and simulate Polynesian social systems. It was the publication of her ethnography of American university student life under the pen name 'Rebekah Nathan', and the ensuing discussions of ethnographic ethics, for which she has most received attention. Biography Small was born in 1949 and raised in New York City, New York. She is 68 years old. Rebekah Nathan is her pseudonym, which she had to use to protect the identity of her students and her university. Throughout the writing of My Freshman Year, Nathan paid for all of the expenses in order to protect students‚Äô confidentiality that could lead to situations that could harm them. Her projects formed alliances with numerous regional groups, such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Institute for Law & Systems Research, and the Hopi Arts & Crafts Coop Guild. She earned state and national recognition, including the Praxis Award for Excellence in Applied Anthropology, the National Points of Light award, the Governor's Special Recognition, and Best Educational Practices in Post-Secondary Education in the state of Arizona award (for her co-founded mentoring and college scholarship program for low-income youth). Dedicated to her love of teaching, Cathy is unmarried and does not have children. Her ethnographic work, including her book Voyages (1997, Cornell University Press) about Tongan islander immigration to the U.S., has focused on understanding long-term social change. Dr. Small's journey in ethnographic studies has expanded to the South Pacific. In the region more than 100 universities have adopted her book Voyages. Her works were even selected by Pacific Studies for scholarly review. Ethnographic ethics Small used the anthropological methodology of participant observation to study the contemporary life and practices of American university students. During a leave of absence from teaching, during the fall of 2002, at the age of 52, she enrolled as a student at Northern Arizona University, signing up for a standard first year range of courses. So as to more closely understand first year students' emotional, social and academic experiences, she moved into the student dorms and sequestered herself from family and friends. Two weeks before the date of her publication for this book, there was an article in the New York Times, because people had figured out she was going by a different name the whole time she was attending this school. Small attended classes, completed homework, and participated in student activities. For one year, Small took classes, hung out in the student lounge (where she once got busted by the R.A. for drinking beer), participated in pickup volleyball games, and asked her fellow students a lot of questions. She also conducted interviews with her peers to get a closer look into the lives of other college students living on campus. Using the name ‚ÄúRebekah Nathan‚Äù, the main focus of her book was to prove that college campuses are not a total unity and do not have a sense of community, but rather the social life is more controlled by ego centered networks or self selected peoples. During her stay at Northern Arizona University she collected her data needed to write her book My Freshman Year by taking numerous surveys visually to see what races of people sit with each other to add to her central idea of how a social life actual is. When asked, she described herself as a writer interested in seeing what university was like. Dr. Small began Pipeline NAU, a program with the support of university administration and the help of committed faculty members. Approximately half of her interlocutors figured out she was a professor of anthropology at NAU. Small obtained informed consent from students she wanted to quote, although in her book she never identified them by name. She used the pseudonyms 'Rebekah Nathan' and 'AnyU', to protect the students and her university. Her intention was to offer enough ambiguity to provide privacy to her interlocutors while they were still in school. By the end of the year, Cathy had come to the conclusion that \\"ego-centered networks\\" are present all over university campuses. However, New York Sun journalist Jacob Gershman reviewed the book just before it was released, and correctly suggested to which university and professor the pseudonyms referred. The book consequently became the subject of a media frenzy. It sparked numerous debates about the ethics of 'going undercover' in research, and Small's own career motives for writing the book. Using pen names in anthropology has several precedents, including \\"Elenore Smith Bowen\\" (Laura Bohannan) and \\"Cesara Manda\\" (Karla Poewe), although it does seem to be a female practice. Equally, ethnographic studies of student life have precedents, the most well known being by Michael Moffatt (1989) and Dorothy C. Holland and Margaret A. Eisenhart. Cathy Small however, was the first anthropologist to attempt to use pseudonyms specifically to protect her interlocutors, while raising the issue of secrecy and ethnographic ethics in an afterword to the same book. The book also stimulated discussions about the intellectual laziness of university students, and the difficulties of fully engaging in university without adequate financial support. Most students worked while attending school and rather than engaging in political, philosophical social justice or intellectual matters, students prioritized courses that promised to help them repay heavy student loans and spent a lot of time discussing bodily functions. Awards and honors In 1997, Dr. Cathy Small was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for 1998 and 1999 to model and simulate Polynesian social systems. She also received the American Anthropology Association/Oxford University Press Award for Undergraduate Teaching of Anthropology in 2008‚Äì2009 academic year.

Gameplay In the game, the player controls protagonist Indiana Jones going through levels taken directly from the film, albeit with a shortened and simplified plot. The game begins in 1938, with Indy receiving a package from Venice, Italy, that turns out to be his father's Grail Diary. At the same time, he receives a telegram from Marcus Brody telling him the Cross of Coronado is on a ship off the Portuguese coast. The player is then presented with the choice of recovering the Cross of Coronado or going to Venice. When Indy goes to recover the Cross, he boards a ship and must defeat a certain number of Panama Hat's goons before fighting the boss himself. He can also head to Venice where he is presented with a sliding puzzle challenge which he must complete before a fire, traveling through the tunnel, engulfs the room. By solving the puzzle in time, Indy receives a sketch showing the true holy grail. After finishing his first mission, Indy will receive a telegraph from Sallah telling him that Henry Jones, Sr. was taken captive by the Nazis is being held at Brunwald Castle and Marcus Brody has gone missing. After finishing his second mission, he will receive another telegraph telling him the location of the Holy Grail. Saving Marcus takes place on top of a German tank in Iskenderun where Indy has to kill Nazis before the tank plunges over a cliff. At Brunwald Castle, he must navigate a convoluted maze to find Henry Jones Sr. In several of the missions, if the player fails, the Nazis steal Henry's diary and Indy must travel to Berlin to recover it via a motorcycle riding sequence. In the final level of the game, Indy finds himself at the Lost Temple. He must carefully navigate the floor to spell out the word \\"Jehovah\\". If he steps on the wrong tile, it falls, and if he takes too long, the torch goes out. Afterwards, he reaches the final sanctum containing the Knight and several grails. If the player has the sketch from Venice, it will aid in identifying the correct grail. Choosing the correct Grail will show the ending. The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Reception Robert Swan of Computer and Video Games gave the game an 89 percent rating. Swan praised the graphics, music and sound effects, and stated that the game \\"has got to be one of the best\\" NES games released up to that point. Nintendo Power noted that the film's action scenes \\"translate well\\" to the game. Skyler Miller of AllGame praised the graphics and music, as well as the cutscenes, but she criticized the gameplay and gave the game two and a half stars out of five.

Venezia Santa Lucia () is the central station of Venice in the north-east of Italy. It is a terminus and located at the northern edge of Venice's historic city (). The station is one of Venice's two most important railway stations; the other one is Venezia Mestre, a mainline junction station on Venice's mainland district of Mestre. Both Santa-Lucia and Mestre stations are managed by Grandi Stazioni and they are connected to each other by Ponte della Libert√† (). Location Venezia Santa Lucia is located in Cannaregio district, the northernmost of the six historic sestieri (districts) of Venice's historic city. It is situated on the northernmost island and near the western end of the Grand Canal. The station lies at the mark of the Milan‚ÄìVenice railway. A bridge over the Grand Canal, the Ponte degli Scalzi (or Ponte dei Scalzi) (), links the concourse in front of the station with the sestiere of Santa Croce. Venice's historic city had access only by river boats or railway until 1933 (construction of the road bridge and of Piazzale Roma). Since then, a terminal has been built for road transport with car parks and bus stations. History Steam train from Santa Lucia to Bassano del Grappa, August 1973. An Italo train at the station. An Intercity Notte train arriving at the station. Construction of Santa Lucia railway station began in 1860 under the Austrian Empire. In order to make room for both the station building and its forecourt, a convent and the Church of Santa Lucia were demolished in 1861. The station in turn took up the name of this church. The current station building is one of the few modernist buildings facing the Grand Canal. It is the result of a series of plans started up by the rationalist architect Angiolo Mazzoni in 1924 and developed by him over the next decade. In 1934, a contest for a detailed design for the current station was won by Virgilio Vallot. Between 1936 and 1943, Mazzoni and Vallot collaborated on the construction of the station building; Mazzoni also designed the train hall. The final implementation, however, was undertaken only after the Second World War. In 1952, the station was completed on a design which had been developed by another architect, Paul Perilli. In November 2009, work began on the renovation of Santa Lucia station. The renovation programme would include improvements to the use of spaces and the flow of internal transit. In addition, certain architectural elements would be recovered and restored; the atrium would be altered to house several retail spaces. This project was completed in 2012 with a cost of 24 million euros. Features As the current station building is low and wide, it does not dominate its surroundings. The flanks of its fa√ßade are decorated with Venetian lions. Behind the fa√ßade, there is a sizeable main hall with ticketing facilities, shops, offices and luggage storage facilities. The main hall also leads to the station's 16 platforms.

The fifth consecutive year for the festival, organizers planned a program of about 100 films, with an emphasis on Asian cinema.TAT's rescheduled film festival on July 19-29, The Nation, retrieved 2007-03-17. Scheduling, budgetary difficulties Originally scheduled for January 26 to February 5, the festival was postponed because of a lack of available venues, since Bangkok cinemas at the time had planned to be fully booked with screenings of the part one of The Legend of King Naresuan. In addition, the film festival organization was hit with a massive budget cut, from 180 million baht to 60 million baht, which resulted in festival organizers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand, having to break their contract with Los Angeles-based Film Festival Management, which had programmed the festival since 2004. In previous years, the festival's focus had been on big-budget Hollywood films and lavish, red-carpet appearances by celebrities, flown to Bangkok at the festival's expense. With the budget cut and the focus on Asian films, the 2007 festival was expected to be a departure from past years.BKK International Film Festival reschedules , The Nation, 2007-02-22. Controversy The festival initially announced that the French- produced animated feature Persepolis would open the festival. The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi (who co-directed the film), telling the story of her childhood growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. However, the Embassy of Iran asked the festival organizers to consider showing another film from Iran, so Persepolis was dropped from the program. The festival director, Chattan Kunjara Na Ayudhya, was quoted as saying: > I was invited by the Iranian embassy to discuss the matter and we both came > to mutual agreement that it would be beneficial to both countries if the > film was not shown. It's a good film, but there are other > considerations.Thailand pulls Iranian cartoon from film festival, Reuters, > 2007-06-27. > We had a request from the Iranian Embassy that the film festival remove the > film, and we did. Now we move on.Thai festival removes praised film after > pressure from Iran, AP, 2007-06-27. However, Chattan also said that the decision to cancel the film was his alone and that \\"there was no outside pressure\\". The Hungarian film, Children of Glory, depicting the \\"Blood in the Water\\" Olympic water polo match and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, was chosen as the replacement opening film. Program highlights The festival's lineup featured a retrospective of films by Spanish director Luis Bu√±uel and a tribute to Indian actress Hema Malini. Malini was among the celebrities taking part in the festival's opening night festivities. The main competition categories for the Golden Kinaree were for international films and ASEAN films from Southeast Asia, as well as an international short-film competition. Non-competition sections were for Thai Panorama (Thai films released in 2006 and 2007) Asian films, ASEAN films, documentaries and the wide-ranging Windows on the World. The closing film was Muay Thai Chaiya, a Thai boxing drama film directed by Kongkiat Khomsiri.

NSAIDs are perhaps the best- known prostaglandin antagonists; they suppress the signaling function of prostaglandins, which are important mediators of pain, fever, and inflammation responses, by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes and thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2 production by boosting production of lipocortin, an inhibitor protein. Relatively new NSAIDs, known as COX-2 selective inhibitors or coxibs, are used as specific inhibitors of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase. The development of these drugs allowed the circumvention of the negative gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs while still effectively reducing inflammation. Adverse effects NSAIDs have been shown to increase the risk of myocardial infarction when taken on a chronic basis for at least 18 months. One emerging hypothesis that may explain these cardiovascular effects is that coxibs create an imbalance in circulating TxA2 (thromboxane A2) and PGI2 (prostacyclin) levels. An increase in the ratio of TxA2/PGI2 could lead to increased platelet aggregation and dysregulation of platelet homeostasis. The GI and renal systems of patients who are treated with NSAIDS for a long period of time may experience unwanted side effects compared to patients who are treated for shorter durations. Studies on NSAIDS have shown that it can cause acute kidney injury by inhibiting prostaglandin production. The decreased levels of prostaglandins increases the risks of interstitial nephritis since there is lower blood flow to the kidneys. However, the risks of NSAIDs induced kidney failure is higher in people which diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

He is regarded as a leading intellectual figure on the island and is influential in literature and the media. His native language is Mauritian Creole, though he is fluent in French and English as well (Asgarally teaches in the latter). Biography Asgarally was born in a part of Mauritius where many ethnic groups are co-located and has tried to bring the groups together through a philosophy of peace. In this regard, Asgarally opposes the ‚Äúmulticultural‚Äù approach, which he believes emphasizes differences between cultures and individuals, and instead advocates an emphasis upon the commonalities between people. He asserts that there is a fundamental unity of people as human beings which can then become the basis upon which any balanced system needs be built. As a result of such balance, Asgarally explains that people would see each other as equal partners and enjoy a confidence in both themselves and each other - there would also be equal access to economic and political power. Asgarally has published ten books on diverse but related topics, including literature, social issues, philosophy, history, education, culture and the arts. He has also written about the consequences of slavery in the Indian Ocean. Together with the winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Literature, Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl√©zio (Cl√©zio's parents had strong ties with Mauritius), Asgarally has created the Fondation pour l'Interculturel et la Paix (FIP) website.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are sometimes colloquially referred to as leukasts. Leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, like zileuton and Hypericum perforatum, can be used to treat these diseases. They are less effective than corticosteroids for treating asthma, but more effective for treating certain mast cell disorders. Approaches There are two main approaches to block the actions of leukotrienes. =Inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway= Drugs that inhibit the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase will inhibit the synthetic pathway of leukotriene metabolism; drugs such as MK-886 that block the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibit functioning of 5-lipoxygenase and may help in treating atherosclerosis. Examples of 5-LOX inhibitors include drugs, such as meclofenamate sodium and zileuton. Some chemicals found in trace amounts in food, and some dietary supplements, also have been shown to inhibit 5-LOX, such as baicalein, caffeic acid, curcumin, hyperforin and St John's wort. =Antagonism of cysteinyl-leukotriene type 1 receptors= Agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast block the actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes at the CysLT1 receptor on target cells such as bronchial smooth muscle via receptor antagonism. These modifiers have been shown to improve asthma symptoms, reduce asthma exacerbations and limit markers of inflammation such as eosinophil counts in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Comparison of alignment software for genome-wide bisulphite sequence data. Nucleic Acids Research 40(10): e79. sequencing (also known as bisulphite sequencing) is the use of bisulfite treatment of DNA before routine sequencing to determine the pattern of methylation. DNA methylation was the first discovered epigenetic mark, and remains the most studied. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a methyl group to the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues of the dinucleotide CpG, and is implicated in repression of transcriptional activity. Treatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA that has been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines. Thus, bisulfite treatment introduces specific changes in the DNA sequence that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information. The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between single nucleotide polymorphisms (cytosines and thymidine) resulting from bisulfite conversion (Figure 1).  Methods  Bisulfite sequencing applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides. Other non- sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a genome-wide level. All strategies assume that bisulfite- induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete, and this serves as the basis of all subsequent techniques. Ideally, the method used would determine the methylation status separately for each allele. Alternative methods to bisulfite sequencing include Combined Bisulphite Restriction Analysis and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). Methodologies to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA are continuously being developed. To summarize these rapidly evolving methodologies, numerous review articles have been written. The methodologies can be generally divided into strategies based on methylation-specific PCR (MSP) (Figure 4), and strategies employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed under non-methylation-specific conditions (Figure 3). Microarray-based methods use PCR based on non-methylation-specific conditions also. = Non-methylation-specific PCR based methods = Figure 3: DNA methylation analysis methods not based on methylation-specific PCR. Following bisulfite conversion, the genomic DNA is amplified with PCR that does not discriminate between methylated and non-methylated sequences. The numerous methods available are then used to make the discrimination based on the changes within the amplicon as a result of bisulfite conversion.  Direct sequencing  The first reported method of methylation analysis using bisulfite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to bisulfite conversion. Primers are designed to be strand-specific as well as bisulfite- specific (i.e., primers containing non-CpG cytosines such that they are not complementary to non-bisulfite-treated DNA), flanking (but not involving) the methylation site of interest. Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR. All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as adenines in the amplified antisense strand. By incorporating high throughput sequencing adaptors into the PCR primers, PCR products can be sequenced with massively parallel sequencing. Alternatively, and labour-intensively, PCR product can be cloned and sequenced. Nested PCR methods can be used to enhance the product for sequencing. All subsequent DNA methylation analysis techniques using bisulfite-treated DNA is based on this report by Frommer et al. (Figure 2). Although most other modalities are not true sequencing-based techniques, the term \\"bisulfite sequencing\\" is often used to describe bisulfite-conversion DNA methylation analysis techniques in general. Pyrosequencing Pyrosequencing has also been used to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA without using methylation-specific PCR. Following PCR amplification of the region of interest, pyrosequencing is used to determine the bisulfite-converted sequence of specific CpG sites in the region. The ratio of C-to-T at individual sites can be determined quantitatively based on the amount of C and T incorporation during the sequence extension. The main limitation of this method is the cost of the technology. However, Pyrosequencing does well allow for extension to high-throughput screening methods. A further improvement to this technique was recently described by Wong et al., which uses allele-specific primers that incorporate single-nucleotide polymorphisms into the sequence of the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal alleles. This technique is of particular usefulness for genomic imprinting analysis.  Methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA)  This method is based on the single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCA) method developed for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. SSCA differentiates between single-stranded DNA fragments of identical size but distinct sequence based on differential migration in non-denaturating electrophoresis. In MS-SSCA, this is used to distinguish between bisulfite-treated, PCR-amplified regions containing the CpG sites of interest. Although SSCA lacks sensitivity when only a single nucleotide difference is present, bisulfite treatment frequently makes a number of C-to-T conversions in most regions of interest, and the resulting sensitivity approaches 100%. MS-SSCA also provides semi-quantitative analysis of the degree of DNA methylation based on the ratio of band intensities. However, this method is designed to assess all CpG sites as a whole in the region of interest rather than individual methylation sites.  High resolution melting analysis (HRM)  A further method to differentiate converted from unconverted bisulfite-treated DNA is using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM), a quantitative PCR-based technique initially designed to distinguish SNPs. The PCR amplicons are analyzed directly by temperature ramping and resulting liberation of an intercalating fluorescent dye during melting. The degree of methylation, as represented by the C-to-T content in the amplicon, determines the rapidity of melting and consequent release of the dye. This method allows direct quantitation in a single-tube assay, but assesses methylation in the amplified region as a whole rather than at specific CpG sites. Methylation-sensitive single-nucleotide primer extension (MS-SnuPE) MS-SnuPE employs the primer extension method initially designed for analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms. DNA is bisulfite-converted, and bisulfite-specific primers are annealed to the sequence up to the base pair immediately before the CpG of interest. The primer is allowed to extend one base pair into the C (or T) using DNA polymerase terminating dideoxynucleotides, and the ratio of C to T is determined quantitatively. A number of methods can be used to determine this C:T ratio. At the beginning, MS-SnuPE relied on radioactive ddNTPs as the reporter of the primer extension. Fluorescence-based methods or Pyrosequencing can also be used. However, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time- of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis to differentiate between the two polymorphic primer extension products can be used, in essence, based on the GOOD assay designed for SNP genotyping. Ion pair reverse-phase high- performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) has also been used to distinguish primer extension products.  Base-specific cleavage/MALDI-TOF  A recently described method by Ehrich et al. further takes advantage of bisulfite-conversions by adding a base-specific cleavage step to enhance the information gained from the nucleotide changes. By first using in vitro transcription of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A can be used to cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites. As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine- specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil- specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired. The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Bisulfite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand. C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated CpG sites. By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of CpG sites within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole. This method demonstrated efficacy for high-throughput screening, allowing for interrogation of numerous CpG sites in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner. = Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) = Figure 4: Methylation-specific PCR is a sensitive method to discriminately amplify and detect a methylated region of interest using methylated-specific primers on bisulfite-converted genomic DNA. Such primers will anneal only to sequences that are methylated, and thus containing 5-methylcytosines that are resistant to conversion by bisulfite. In alternative fashion, unmethylated-specific primers can be used. This alternative method of methylation analysis also uses bisulfite-treated DNA but avoids the need to sequence the area of interest. Instead, primer pairs are designed themselves to be \\"methylated-specific\\" by including sequences complementing only unconverted 5-methylcytosines, or, on the converse, \\"unmethylated-specific\\", complementing thymines converted from unmethylated cytosines. Methylation is determined by the ability of the specific primer to achieve amplification. This method is particularly useful to interrogate CpG islands with possibly high methylation density, as increased numbers of CpG pairs in the primer increase the specificity of the assay. Placing the CpG pair at the 3'-end of the primer also improves the sensitivity. The initial report using MSP described sufficient sensitivity to detect methylation of 0.1% of alleles. In general, MSP and its related protocols are considered to be the most sensitive when interrogating the methylation status at a specific locus. The MethyLight method is based on MSP, but provides a quantitative analysis using quantitative PCR. Methylated- specific primers are used, and a methylated-specific fluorescence reporter probe is also used that anneals to the amplified region. In alternative fashion, the primers or probe can be designed without methylation specificity if discrimination is needed between the CpG pairs within the involved sequences. Quantitation is made in reference to a methylated reference DNA. A modification to this protocol to increase the specificity of the PCR for successfully bisulfite-converted DNA (ConLight-MSP) uses an additional probe to bisulfite-unconverted DNA to quantify this non-specific amplification. Further methodology using MSP-amplified DNA analyzes the products using melting curve analysis (Mc-MSP). This method amplifies bisulfite-converted DNA with both methylated-specific and unmethylated-specific primers, and determines the quantitative ratio of the two products by comparing the differential peaks generated in a melting curve analysis. A high-resolution melting analysis method that uses both quantitative PCR and melting analysis has been introduced, in particular, for sensitive detection of low-level methylation = Microarray-based methods = Microarray-based methods are a logical extension of the technologies available to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA to allow for genome-wide analysis of methylation. Oligonucleotide microarrays are designed using pairs of oligonucleotide hybridization probes targeting CpG sites of interest. One is complementary to the unaltered methylated sequence, and the other is complementary to the C-to-U-converted unmethylated sequence. The probes are also bisulfite-specific to prevent binding to DNA incompletely converted by bisulfite. The Illumina Methylation Assay is one such assay that applies the bisulfite sequencing technology on a microarray level to generate genome-wide methylation data.  Limitations  =5-Hydroxymethylcytosine= Bisulfite sequencing is used widely across mammalian genomes, however complications have arisen with the discovery of a new mammalian DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.Tahiliani M, Koh KP, Shen Y, Pastor WA, Bandukwala H, BrudnoY, et al. Conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine inmammalian DNA by MLL partner TET1. Science. 2009;324(5929):930-5.Kriaucionis S, Heintz N. The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain. Science.2009;324(5929):929-30. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine converts to cytosine-5-methylsulfonate upon bisulfite treatment, which then reads as a C when sequenced.Huang Y, Pastor WA, Shen Y, Tahiliani M, Liu DR, Rao A. The Behaviour of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in Bisulfite Sequencing. PLOS ONE.2010;5(1):e8888. Therefore, bisulfite sequencing cannot discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This means that the output from bisulfite sequencing can no longer be defined as solely DNA methylation, as it is the composite of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The development of Tet-assisted oxidative bisulfite sequencing by Chuan He at the University of Chicago is now able to distinguish between the two modifications at single base resolution.Yu, M., Hon, G. C., Szulwach, K. E., Song, C., Jin, P., Ren, B., He, C. Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Nat. Protocols 2012, 7, 2159. = Incomplete conversion = Bisulfite sequencing relies on the conversion of every single unmethylated cytosine residue to uracil. If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in false positive results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore denaturation of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical. It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in agarose gel has been reported to improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate. = Degradation of DNA during bisulfite treatment = A major challenge in bisulfite sequencing is the degradation of DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion. The conditions necessary for complete conversion, such as long incubation times, elevated temperature, and high bisulfite concentration, can lead to the degradation of about 90% of the incubated DNA. Given that the starting amount of DNA is often limited, such extensive degradation can be problematic. The degradation occurs as depurinations resulting in random strand breaks. Therefore, the longer the desired PCR amplicon, the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired amplicon. Techniques can also be used to minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature. = Other concerns = A potentially significant problem following bisulfite treatment is incomplete desulfonation of pyrimidine residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution. This may inhibit some DNA polymerases, rendering subsequent PCR difficult. However, this situation can be avoided by monitoring the pH of the solution to ensure that desulfonation will be complete. A final concern is that bisulfite treatment greatly reduces the level of complexity in the sample, which can be problematic if multiple PCR reactions are to be performed (2006). Primer design is more difficult, and inappropriate cross-hybridization is more frequent.  Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis  The advances in bisulfite sequencing have led to the possibility of applying them at a genome-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning. The mapping of the human epigenome is seen by many scientists as the logical follow-up to the completion of the Human Genome Project. This epigenomic information will be important in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated. Since the epigenome is less stable than the genome, it is thought to be important in gene-environment interactions. Epigenomic mapping is inherently more complex than genome sequencing, however, since the epigenome is much more variable than the genome. One‚Äôs epigenome varies with age, differs between tissues, is altered by environmental factors, and shows aberrations in diseases. Such rich epigenomic mapping, however, representing different ages, tissue types, and disease states, would yield valuable information on the normal function of epigenetic marks as well as the mechanisms leading to aging and disease. Direct benefits of epigenomic mapping include probable advances in cloning technology. It is believed that failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many cancers. Global hypomethylation results in decreased genomic stability, while local hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters often accounts for their loss of function. Specific patterns of methylation are indicative of specific cancer types, have prognostic value, and can help to guide the best course of treatment. Large-scale epigenome mapping efforts are under way around the world and have been organized under the Human Epigenome Project. This is based on a multi-tiered strategy, whereby bisulfite sequencing is used to obtain high-resolution methylation profiles for a limited number of reference epigenomes, while less thorough analysis is performed on a wider spectrum of samples. This approach is intended to maximize the insight gained from a given amount of resources, as high-resolution genome-wide mapping remains a costly undertaking. Gene-set analysis (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. genome-wide bisulfite sequencing); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene. Oxidative bisulfite sequencing 5-Methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine both read as a C in bisulfite sequencing. Oxidative bisulfite sequencing is a method to discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single base resolution. The method employs a specific (Tet-assisted) chemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine, which subsequently converts to uracil during bisulfite treatment.Booth MJ, Branco MR, Ficz G, Oxley D, Krueger F, Reik W, et al. quantitative sequencing of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single-base resolution. Science. 2012;336(6083):934-7. The only base that then reads as a C is 5‚Äëmethylcytosine, giving a map of the true methylation status in the DNA sample. Levels of 5‚Äëhydroxymethylcytosine can also be quantified by measuring the difference between bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite sequencing.

The main antithyroid drugs are carbimazole (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. A less common antithyroid agent is potassium perchlorate. Graves' disease In Graves' disease, treatment with antithyroid medications must be given for six months to two years, in order to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells. A randomized control trial testing single dose treatment for Graves' found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthyouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15 mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150 mg groups). But generally both drugs are considered equivalent. A study has shown no difference in outcome for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However, two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% (sensitivity 39%, specificity 98%), a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent to a positive TSHR- Ab. Competitive antagonists of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors are currently being investigated as a possible treatment for Grave's disease. Adverse effects The most dangerous side-effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU); this is an idiosyncratic reaction which generally resolves on cessation of drug. It occurs in about 0.2 to 0.3% of cases treated with antithyroid drugs. Others include granulocytopenia (dose dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia, and‚Äîfor propylthiouracil‚Äîsevere, fulminant liver failure.

Plot The movie circuits around flashbacks of Lansky's life, first showing Lansky as an old man looking for a rock to put on his grandfather's grave in Jerusalem. Upon seeing soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force, Lansky expresses regret that his grandfather never lived to see them. As he walks through a tunnel, he catches sight of an old man. He recalls how at the age of 10, he witnessed an elderly Jew being bludgeoned to death with an axe during a pogrom. Later, as the shtetl is burning down, his parents hastily pack up their valuables and prepare to flee to America. Lansky's grandfather watches skeptically. His father suggests, \\"You think I should fight? You stay, and you fight.\\" The setting then changes to the Lower East Side, Manhattan. After his mother gives him money to go buy challah for Shabbat, Lansky comes upon a game of craps on the street corner. He then returns home penniless and deeply ashamed. Later, Benjamin Siegel and Lansky are eyeing the Irish-American boy who operates the craps game. Lansky makes his bet, and as he's throwing the dice, the owner's friend slides him some dice. Certain that the game is rigged, Lansky shouts that he has won the bet. The Irish boy pushes at the young Lansky, Lansky pushes him back, and then the teenager's friend slides out his knife and cuts Lansky's arm. Siegel come into the scene and hits the knife-wielding kid with a brick, shouting at him to give him the money. As Lansky and Siegel are walking down the docks they see the Irish kid who bet against them in the alley. The Irish kid is shouting Irish words about him being Jewish. Lansky jumps into the sea where the Irish kid is hanging about, Lansky then goes under water and slits the Irish kid's neck. As the blood is sliding around in the water, the film returns to Lansky as an old man drinking wine with the Jewish man. The Jewish man goes to pray in the synagogue. The film then shows Lansky owning the crap games as a kid. Lansky goes into an alley to count his money, where he meets Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. When Luciano tells him to give protection money, the gang starts beating Lansky. Lansky says, \\"nothing for nothing.\\" Luciano takes a liking to Lansky's guts, and they then work together selling illegal alcohol. Bugsy, Luciano and Lansky are making their way driving the truck carrying alcohol. They are ambushed by Arnold Rothstein's associates. Luciano and Lansky make a deal, saying they will give them one truck full of alcohol and no one will be shot at. When Lansky, Bugsy and Luciano get into the truck, it is revealed that the truck was full of empty suitcases. Impressed, Rothstein invites them to his house for a sit-down. He offers Bugsy and Lansky a job to work for him, as he knows Lansky is smart. After Rothstein is taken out, Meyer and Bugsy work with Luciano to take over the crime world, killing the Italian bosses Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano. Luciano then sets up the Commission, and the five Italian families can now work freely with Jews. Meyer builds his prestige by running all the casinos in Cuba and helping Bugsy get a start in Las Vegas. After Bugsy spends more money than the plan and his girlfriend is questioned abouttaking money, Meyer buys his childhood friend time to turn the venture around. A month after warning Siegel that the Flamingo is not earning money, Lansky can no longer prevent the Commission from taking out Siegel. Years later, Lansky is on the run in Israel to avoid tax evasion charges but is extradited back to the US. He is lucky to get off on the charges and retires to Miami. At the climax of the film, Lansky gives an interview to a French journalist. When the journalist asks him what he would do if he could live his life over, Lansky responds, \\"I wouldn't change a thing.\\" Cast * Richard Dreyfuss - Meyer Lansky * Yosef Carmon as Rabbi. * Mosko Alkalai as jewelry shopkeeper * Fima Noveck as Hasid in Grodno * Joshua Praw as Meyer Lansky at age 8 * Bernard Hiller as Max Lansky * Jill Holden as Yetta Lansky * Larry Moss as Benjamin Lansky * Chris Marquette as Jake Lansky (age 9-11) * Ryan Merriman as Meyer Lansky (age 12-14) * Benjamin Kimball Smith as Benjamin K.

The databank integrates a number of existing databases to provide a comprehensive overview of the information currently available for a given molecule. Background The Blueprint Initiative started as a research program in the lab of Dr. Christopher Hogue at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. On December 14, 2005 Unleashed Informatics Limited acquired the commercial rights to The Blueprint Initiative intellectual property. This included rights to the protein interaction database BIND, the small molecule interaction database SMID, as well as the data warehouse SeqHound. Unleashed Informatics is a data management service provider and is overseeing the management and curation of The Blueprint Initiative under the guidance of Dr. Hogue.Blueprint.org Construction BOND integrates the original Blueprint Initiative databases as well as other databases, such as Genbank, combined with many tools required to analyze these data. Annotation links for sequences, including taxon identifiers, redundant sequences, Gene Ontology descriptions, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man identifiers, conserved domains, data base cross-references, LocusLink Identifiers and complete genomes are also available. BOND facilitates cross- database queries and is an open access resource which integrates interaction and sequence data.BOND at Unleashed Informatics Small Molecule Interaction Database (SMID) The Small Molecule Interaction Database is a database containing protein domain-small molecule interactions. It uses a domain-based approach to identify domain families, found in the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), which interact with a query small molecule. The CDD from NCBI amalgamates data from several different sources; Protein FAMilies (PFAM), Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART), Cluster of Orthologous Genes (COGs), and NCBI‚Äôs own curated sequences. The data in SMID is derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a database of known protein crystal structures. SMID can be queried by entering a protein GI, domain identifier, PDB ID or SMID ID. The results of a search provide small molecule, protein, and domain information for each interaction identified in the database. Interactions with non-biological contacts are normally screened out by default. SMID-BLAST is a tool developed to annotate known small-molecule binding sites as well as to predict binding sites in proteins whose crystal structures have not yet been determined. The prediction is based on extrapolation of known interactions, found in the PDB, to interactions between an uncrystallized protein with a small molecule of interest. SMID-BLAST was validated against a test set of known small molecule interactions from the PDB. It was shown to be an accurate predictor of protein-small molecule interactions; 60% of predicted interactions identically matched the PDB annotated binding site, and of these 73% had greater than 80% of the binding residues of the protein correctly identified. Hogue, C et al. estimated that 45% of predictions that were not observed in the PDB data do in fact represent true positives.Snyder, K, et al.. Domain-based small molecule binding site annotation. BMC Bioinformatics 7: 152 (2006) Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) =Introduction= The idea of a database to document all known molecular interactions was originally put forth by Tony Pawson in the 1990s and was later developed by scientists at the University of Toronto in collaboration with the University of British Columbia. The development of the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) has been supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Genome Canada,BIND at genomecanada.ca the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research and Development Fund. BIND was originally designed to be a constantly growing depository for information regarding biomolecular interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. As proteomics is a rapidly advancing field, there is a need to have information from scientific journals readily available to researchers. BIND facilitates the understanding of molecular interactions and pathways involved in cellular processes and will eventually give scientists a better understanding of developmental processes and disease pathogenesis The major goals of the BIND project are: to create a public proteomics resource that is available to all; to create a platform to enable datamining from other sources (PreBIND); to create a platform capable of presenting visualizations of complex molecular interactions. From the beginning, BIND has been open access and software can be freely distributed and modified. Currently, BIND includes a data specification, a database and associated data mining and visualization tools. Eventually, it is hoped that BIND will be a collection of all the interactions occurring in each of the major model organisms. =Database structure= BIND contains information on three types of data: interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. # Interactions are the basic component of BIND and describe how 2 or more objects (A and B) interact with each other. The objects can be a variety of things: DNA, RNA, genes, proteins, ligands, or photons. The interaction entry contains the most information about a molecule; it provides information on its name and synonyms, where it is found (e.g. where in the cell, what species, when it is active, etc.), and its sequence or where its sequence can be found. The interaction entry also outlines the experimental conditions required to observe binding in vitro, chemical dynamics (including thermodynamics and kinetics). # The second type of BIND entries are the molecular complexes. Molecular complexes are defined as an aggregate of molecules that are stable and have a function when bound to each other. The record may also contain some information on the role of the complex in various interactions and the molecular complex entry links data from 2 or more interaction records. # The third component of BIND is the pathway record section. A pathway consists of a network of interactions that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes. This section may also contain information on phenotypes and diseases related to the pathway. The minimum amount of information needed to create an entry in BIND is a PubMed publication reference and an entry in another database (e.g. GenBank). Each entry within the database provides references/authors for the data. As BIND is a constantly growing database, all components of BIND track updates and changes.Bader, GD, et al. BIND- The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database. Nucleic Acids Research 29: 242-245 (2001). BIND is based on a data specification written using Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) language. ASN.1 is used also by NCBI when storing data for their Entrez system and because of this BIND uses the same standards as NCBI for data representation. The ASN.1 language is preferred because it can be easily translated into other data specification languages (e.g. XML), can easily handle complex data and can be applied to all biological interactions ‚Äì not just proteins. Bader and Hogue (2000) have prepared a detailed manuscript on the ASN.1 data specification used by BIND.Bader, GD, Hogue, CWV. BIND- a data specification for storing and describing biomolecular interactions, molecular complexes and pathways. Bioinformatics 16(5): 465-477 (2000). =Data submission and curation= User submission to the database is encouraged. To contribute to the database, one must submit: contact info, PubMed identifier and the two molecules that interact. The person who submits a record is the owner of it. All records are validated before being made public and BIND is curated for quality assurance. BIND curation has two tracks: high-throughput (HTP) and low-throughput (LTP). HTP records are from papers which have reported more than 40 interaction results from one experimental methodology. HTP curators typically have a bioinformatics backgrounds. The HTP curators are responsible for the collection of storage of experimental data and they also create scripts to update BIND based on new publications. LTP records are curated by individuals with either an MSc or PhD and laboratory experience in interaction research. LTP curators are given further training through the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops. Information on small molecule chemistry is curated separately by chemists to ensure the curator is knowledgeable about the subject. The priority for BIND curation is to focus on LTP to collect information as it is published. Although, HTP studies provide more information at once, there are more LTP studies being reported and similar numbers of interactions are being reported by both tracks. In 2004, BIND collected data from 110 journals.Alfarano, C, et al. The Biomolecular Interaction Network Database and related tools 2005 update. Nucleic Acids Research 33: D418-D424 (2005). =Database growth= BIND has grown significantly since its conception; in fact, the database saw a 10 fold increase in entries between 2003 and 2004. By September 2004, there were over 100,000 interaction records by 2004 (including 58,266 protein-protein, 4,225 genetic, 874 protein-small molecule, 25,857 protein-DNA, and 19,348 biopolymer interactions). The database also contains sequence information for 31,972 proteins, 4560 DNA samples and 759 RNA samples. These entries have been collected from 11,649 publications; therefore, the database represents an important amalgamation of data. The organisms with entries in the database include: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Helicobacter pylori, Bos taurus, HIV-1, Gallus gallus, Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as others. In total, 901 taxa were included by September 2004 and BIND has been split up into BIND-Metazoa, BIND-Fungi, and BIND-Taxroot. Not only is the information contained within the database continually updated, the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in other databases. Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions.Bader, GD, et al.. BIND: the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database. Nucleic Acids Research 31: 248-250 (2003). Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined user- interface that aimed to simplify information retrieval. In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where it continues to be updated and improved. =Special features= BIND was the first database of its kind to contain info on biomolecular interactions, reactions and pathways in one schema. It is also the first to base its ontology on chemistry which allows 3D representation of molecular interactions. The underlying chemistry allows molecular interactions to be described down to the atomic level of resolution. PreBIND an associated system for data mining to locate biomolecular interaction information in the scientific literature. The name or accession number of a protein can be entered and PreBIND will scan the literature and return a list of potentially interacting proteins. BIND BLAST is also available to find interactions with proteins that are similar to the one specified in the query. BIND offers several ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù that many other proteomics databases do not include. The authors of this program have created an extension to traditional IUPAC nomenclature to help describe post-translational modifications that occur to amino acids. These modifications include: acetylation, formylation, methylation, palmitoylation, etc. the extension of the traditional IUPAC codes allows these amino acids to be represented in sequence form as well. BIND also utilizes a unique visualization tool known as OntoGlyphs. The OntoGlyphs were developed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and provide a link back to the original GO information. A number of GO terms have been grouped into categories, each one representing a specific function, binding specificity, or localization in the cell. There are 83 OntoGlyph characters in total. There are 34 functional OntoGlyphs which contain information about the role of the molecule (e.g. cell physiology, ion transport, signaling). There are 25 binding OntoGlyphs which describe what the molecule binds (e.g. ligands, DNA, ions). The other 24 OntoGlyphs provide information about the location of the molecule within a cell (e.g. nucleus, cytoskeleton). The OntoGlyphs can be selected and manipulated to include or exclude certain characteristics from search results. The visual nature of the OntoGlyphs also facilitates pattern recognition when looking at search results. ProteoGlyphs are graphical representations of the structural and binding properties of proteins at the level of conserved domains. The protein is diagrammed as a straight horizontal line and glyphs are inserted to represent conserved domains. Each glyph is displayed to represent the relative position and length of its alignment in the protein sequence. =Accessing the database= Figure 1: Screen shot of sequence results obtained using BOND The database user interface is web-based and can be queried using text or accession numbers/identifiers. Since its integration with the other components of BOND, sequences have been added to interactions, molecular complexes and pathways in the results. Records include information on: BIND ID, description of the interaction/complex/pathway, publications, update records, organism, OntoGlyphs, ProteoGlyphs, and links to other databases where additional information can be found. BIND records include various viewing formats (e.g. HTML, ASN.1, XML, FASTA), various formats for exporting results (e.g. ASN.1, XML, GI list, PDF), and visualizations (e.g. Cytoscape). The exact viewing and exporting options vary depending on what type of data has been retrieved. User statistics The number of Unleashed Registrants has increased 10 fold since the integration of BIND. As of December 2006 registration fell just short of 10,000. Subscribers to the commercial versions of BOND fall into six general categories; agriculture and food, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, informatics, materials and other. The biotechnology sector is the largest of these groups, holding 28% of subscriptions. Pharmaceuticals and informatics follow with 22% and 18% respectively. The United States holds the bulk of these subscriptions, 69%. Other countries with access to the commercial versions of BOND include Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, France, India and Australia. All of these countries fall below 6% in user share.

In 1948 she became the first African American female attorney admitted to the Alabama State Bar; in 1951 she was the second African American woman admitted to the Indiana bar; and in 1959 she was Alaska's first African American attorney. In 1983 Dickerson was the first African American to be elected president of the National Association of Women Lawyers. Her long legal career also helped to pave the way for other women attorneys. In 1995 the American Bar Association named her a Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement honoree. Early life and education Mahala Ashley was born in rural Montgomery County, Alabama, on October 12, 1912, to Hattie (Moss) and John Augustine Ashley. Her father was the owner of a general store. Her siblings included two sisters, Erna and Harriette. Ashley grew up in Alabama. She attended Montgomery Industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School), a private school in Montgomery, where she met Rosa Parks, her lifelong friend who would become an activist in the civil rights movement. In 1935, Ashley graduated cum laude with a degree in sociology from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Following her divorce from her first husband, Henry Dickerson, in 1939, Mahala Ashley enrolled at the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. She graduated cum laude and was one of four women to graduate in her class of 1948. Marriage and family Mahala Ashley married Henry Dickerson in 1938, but they divorced the following year. The Dickersons were the parents of triplet sons: Alfred, John and Henri Christophe \\"Chris\\" (who became a well-known professional bodybuilder). In 1951 Mahala Dickerson married Frank R. Beckwith, an Indianapolis attorney, and relocated with her three sons to Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1958, after her marriage to Beckwith ended in divorce, Dickerson moved to Alaska. The couple had no children together. In 1960 Beckwith became the first African American to run as a candidate for President of the United States in a major-party primary when he ran in Indiana's Republican presidential primary.\\"Biographical Note\\" in He also ran in Indiana's Republican presidential primary in 1964. Career =Legal career= After graduating from law school, Dickerson returned to Alabama to practice law. In 1948 she became was the first African-American woman to be admitted to the Alabama State Bar. Dickerson established offices in Montgomery and Tuskegee, Alabama, where she practiced law for the next three years. In 1951, following her marriage to Frank Beckwith, Dickerson moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, and became the second black woman to be admitted to the Indiana bar. Dickerson and Beckwith practiced together for a year before she opened her own law office in Indianapolis.She was especially interested labor and civil rights issues. In 1953, for example, Dickerson petitioned the Public Service Commission to request that the commissioners deny approval of a local transportation company's requests for fare increases until the company agreed to discontinue what she argued were its discriminatory practices against bus drivers and trolley operators. In 1958, after working as an attorney in Alabama and Indiana, she took a vacation to Alaska and decided to move there with her sons. Dickerson established a homestead of and became the first African American attorney and one of only a few women practicing law in the state. Dickerson established a law practice an Anchorage in 1959. One of her most notable cases was an equal pay lawsuit filed on behalf of a female professor at the University of Alaska. It was one of the first cases representing women professors at an American university whose salaries were lower than their male counterparts. Dickerson initially lost the case, but the court's decision was reversed on appeal in 1975. =Civic and philanthropic activities= During her years in Indianapolis she was active in Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, the National Bar Association, the Lawyers Guild of American, Americans for Democratic Actions, American Society of Friends, the YWCA and NAACP. She also served as chairman of the board of directors of the Marion County [Indiana] Colored Women's Republican Club. Later years Dickerson remained active in her later years. In addition to serving as president of Dickerson and Gibbons, the law firm she established in Alaska, she founded Al-Acres, a charitable non-profit organization. In 1983 she was elected the first black president of the National Association of Women Lawyers. In 1984 the University of Alaska awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. The American Bar Association also recognized Dickerson for her civil rights advocacy and legal career by naming her a Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement honoree in 1995. Dickerson published her memoir, Delayed Justice for Sale, in 1998. Throughout her long legal career Dickerson was considered an advocate for the poor and underprivileged. As she told the Anchorage Daily News, \\"In my life, I didn't have but two things to do. Those were to stay black and to die. I'm just not afraid to fight somebody big.... Whenever there's somebody being mistreated, if they want me, I'll help them.\\"Anchorage Daily News, Profile of M. Ashley Dickerson Dickerson continued to practice law in Alaska until she was in her early nineties, only a few years before her death in 2007. Death and legacy Dickerson died in Wasilla, Alaska, on February 19, 2007, at the age of ninety-four. Dickerson is buried in a cemetery she established on her Alaska property. Dickerson became the first black female attorney admitted to the bar in Alabama (in 1948); the second black woman admitted to the bar in Indiana (in 1951); and Alaska's first black attorney (in 1959). She was also the first black elected as president of the National Association of Women Lawyers (in 1983). With more than fifty-years of legal experience, she also helped to pave the way for other women attorneys. According to her American Bar Association profile, Dickerson prosecuted \\"one of the first equal pay cases on behalf of women university professors who received less pay than their male counterparts.\\" In 1995, the American Bar Association named Dickerson a Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement honoree, an honor also given to U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg (a 1983 honoree) and Sandra Day O'Connor (an honoree in 2000), among other notable women lawyers, judges, law professors, and government leaders. Dickerson's papers are housed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

It is formed from the sequential conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 and then to LTE4, which is the final and most stable cysteinyl leukotriene. Compared to the short half lives of LTC4 and LTD4, LTE4 is relatively stable and accumulates in breath condensation, in plasma, and in urine, making it the dominant cysteinyl leukotriene detected in biologic fluids. Therefore, measurements of LTE4, especially in the urine, are commonly monitored in clinical research studies. Increased production and excretion of LTE4 has been linked to several respiratory diseases, and urinary LTE4 levels are increased during severe asthma attacks and are especially high in people with aspirin-induced asthma, also known as Samter‚Äôs Triad or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Studies have suggested that LTE4 works through its own distinct receptor, and although one has not yet been discovered, research is ongoing to isolate and characterize an LTE4-specific receptor.

In 1825 the factory was located in a residential area in Baker's Row (now Vallance Road), Whitechapel, London: it was destroyed when a boy who was ramming gunpowder into a firework accidentally created a spark which ignited it, and threw it aside as he ran out in fright.

Poland retained control over that region until the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. In time, the Belarusian culture and nationality started to develop in that region, but also increasing number of people became Polonized. Later influences, particularly Lithuanization and Russification, further contributed to the blurry ethnic border and resulted in a region with many territories with significant minority of one culture or another. =1918‚Äì1939= Belarusian language frequency in Poland based on Polish census of 1931 Belarusian minority in the Second Polish Republic In 1921, at the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Belarusian territories were divided between Second Polish Republic and Soviet Russia under the terms of the Peace of Riga. Thus the newly reborn Poland gained a disputed territory, known as Kresy or West Belarus, inhabited by both Belarusians and Poles. According to the Polish census of 1921, there were around 1 million Belarusians in the country. According to Soviet sources, there were 3 million Belarusians in 1921.https://books.google.com/books?id=AP2Hh3LVGaUC&pg;=PA250&dq;=1931+Poland+belorussians#PPA250,M1 Purism and Language: A Study in Modern Ukrainian and Belorussian Nationalism , Indiana University, Bloomington Most historians estimate the number of Belarusians in Poland at that time to be from 1.7 million≈ªarnowski, p. 373 up to 2 million.Mironowicz, p. 80 Belarusians formed 3.1% of the populations of the Second Polish Republic, mostly inhabiting the east-central voivodeships, particularly the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. Belarusians consisted the majority of population of Polesie Voivodship, however most of them didn't declare themselves as Belarusians, but at Tutejsi (\\"Locals\\"). Several thousand Poles were settled in the area pursuant to the legislation of December 20, 1920. In the elections of November 1922, a Belarusian party (in the Blok Mniejszo≈õci Narodowych coalition) obtained 14 seats in the Polish parliament (11 of them in the lower chamber, Sejm).Mironowicz, p. 94 In the spring of 1923, Prime Minister of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski ordered a report on the situation of the Belarusian minority in Poland. That summer, a new regulation was passed allowing for the Belarusian language to be used officially both in courts and in schools. Obligatory teaching of the Belarusian language was introduced in all Polish gymnasia in areas inhabited by Belarusians in 1927. In the 1921‚Äì1926 period Poland did not have a consistent policy towards its ethnic minorities. Belarusian schools, not being subsidized by the Polish government, were facing severe financial problems already by 1921. After an early period of liberalization, tensions between increasingly nationalistic Polish government and various increasingly separatist ethnic minorities started to grow, and the Belarusian minority was no exception. A Belarusian organization, the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union, was banned in 1927, and opposition to Polish government was met with state repressions. Nonetheless compared to the (larger) Ukrainian minority, Belarusians were much less politically aware and active, and thus suffered fewer repressions than the Ukrainians. Increasingly, Belarusians in Poland faced extensive Polonization. After the 1930 elections in Poland, Belarusian representation in the Polish parliament was reduced and in the early 1930s the Polish government started to introduce policies intended to Polonize minorities. In 1935, after the death of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, a new wave of repressions was released upon the minorities, with many Orthodox churches and Belarusian schools being closed. In 1938 about 100 Orthodox churches were destroyed or converted to Roman Catholic ones in the eastern parts of Poland, the majority of them in ethnically Ukrainian territories.Mironowicz, p. 109 Use of the Belarusian language was discouraged. Not a single Belarusian school survived until the spring of 1939, and only 44 schools teaching the Belarusian language still existed in Poland at the beginning of World War II. Belarusian leadership was sent to Bereza Kartuska concentration camp.Ivan S. Lubachko. Belorussia under Soviet Rule, 1917‚Äì1957 (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1972), 137 Earlier, Belarusian political leaders reported to the League of Nations of tens of thousands being flogged by police, and subject to torture in interrogations.Ivan S.

Belorussia: The Making of a Nation (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1956), 128. After the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and pursuant German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, portrayed by Soviet propaganda as 'liberation of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine', some Belarusians welcomed unification with Belorussian SSR, although the attitudes of many changed after experiencing the Soviet terror. Nonetheless from 1939, with the exception of a brief period of Nazi occupation, almost all Belarusians previously living in Poland would live in the Belorussian SSR.Norman Davies, God's Playground (Polish edition), second tome, p.512-513 Stosunki polsko-bia≈Çoruskie pod okupacjƒÖ sowieckƒÖ (1939‚Äì1941) It was initially planned to move the capital of the Byelorussian SSR to Vilnius. However, the same year Joseph Stalin ordered that the city and surrounding region be transferred to Lithuania, which some months later was also invaded by Soviet Union and became a new Soviet Republic ‚Äì Lithuanian SSR. Minsk therefore was proclaimed the capital of the enlarged Byelorussian SSR. The borders of the BSSR were again altered somewhat after the war (notably the largely Polish area around the city of Bia≈Çystok was returned to Poland) but in general they coincide with the borders of the modern Republic of Belarus. After entering the Soviet Union, the people of Western Belarus, especially those who favored democracy and Belarusian independence, immediately faced violent repression from the NKVD, which may explain incidents of local collaboration with Germans during the Nazi occupation of Belarus. Refugees from Western Belarus were arrested by Soviet authorities and frequently executed, Kurapaty graves contain many products from Poland ‚Äì cloths, shoes. The most prominent victim of NKVD was the activist and linguist Branislaw Tarashkyevich. =1989‚Äìpresent= The Belarusian minority has been active in political life in Poland since 1989. In the 2006 elections to the Podlasie Sejmik, the Bia≈Çoruski Komitet Wyborczy (Belarusian Electoral Committee) received 7,914 votes (2.05%), however this was not enough to receive any seats in the Council. The most votes from this list were for Jan Czykwin (2,405), Eugeniusz Wappa (1,669) and Eugeniusz Mironowicz (1,119). When the local elections were repeated in the region on 20 May 2007, the Belarusians again submitted their own electoral committee, which for the first time had several Lithuanians running on the list, in their region of Sejny and Pu≈Ñsk. There is an unknown number of Belarusians in northwest Poland, but some Polish Belarusians were relocated there by the Soviet invasion of Germany in April 1945 and the captured lands of formerly German Pomerania was annexed by Poland.

The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of spirituality. In Western psychology, the concept of self comes from Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Carl Rogers where the self is the inner critic. Some Eastern philosophies reject the self as a delusion. In Buddhist psychology, the attachment to self is an illusion that serves as the main cause of suffering and unhappiness. Discussion Human beings have a self‚Äîthat is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance.Charon, Joel M. Ten Questions: A Sociological Perspective. 5th edition. Thomson & Wadsworth. pg. 260 Christianity sees the self negatively, distorted through sin: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' (Jeremiah 17:9) Alternately, each human self or spirit is a unique creation by God. The \\"desperately wicked self\\" is the sinful self that has chosen to be \\"curved back upon itself\\", but ever with the potential of changing and (by God's grace) turning toward \\"'new life', opened out to love of God and neighbor\\".See Albert Outler as quoted in \\"Outler on the Holy Spirit\\" by George Aikinson, Bristol House, 2004 p. 54\\\\. and p. 87. According to psychologist James Marcia, identity comes from both political and religious views. Marcia also identified exploration and commitment as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. Erik Erikson compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.Kiesling, Chris; Montgomery, Marylin; Sorell, Gwendolyn; Colwell, Ronald. \\"Identity and Spirituality: A Psychosocial Exploration of the Sense of Spiritual Self\\" One description of spirituality is the self's search for \\"ultimate meaning\\" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined on one's life and experiences. Another definition of spiritual identity is \\" a persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual‚Äôs core values.\\" Another description of mind, body, soul, and spirit is a holism of one inner self being of one whole. It all combines together as one whole instead of different parts. Individuals one thoughts, one feeling, one breathing is all completed and occurs as one whole. GT Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pg 478 This theory states that people are bound to complete a task more effectively if they think they will succeed. If a person is more negative about their abilities the chances of them completing the task accordingly are less. Winnicott D. W. Winnicott was of the opinion that psychopathology was in large part generated by an overvaluation of the false self, at the expense of the true self which was linked to the individual's own creativity.Jeff Greenberg et al, Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychotherapy (2004) p. 454 Rogers on self and self-concept Carl Rogers' theory is that \\"people use the term self concept to refer to all the information and beliefs you have as an individual regarding your own nature, unique qualities, and typical behaviors.\\" Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pg. 478 Rogers thought that people develop through relationships with others and also in relation to themselves. An encouraging environment helps people towards this development. Commenting on his clients' search for a real self, Rogers quoted with approval Kierkegaard's statement that \\"the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest form of despair is to choose 'to be another than himself'. On the other hand, 'to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair'\\".Carl Rogers, On Becoming A Person (1961) p. 110 The observing self The \\"Visible\\" self is mainly dependent on a subjective view, that is, as viewed from the specific self. For example: looking in the mirror, we perceive the reflection to be our true \\"self\\".... The witnessing self Ken Wilber describes the Witnessing (or Observing) Self in the following terms: :\\"This observing Self is usually called the Self with a capital S, or the Witness, or pure Presence, or pure Awareness, or Consciousness as such, and this Self as transparent Witness is a direct ray of the living Divine. The ultimate \\"I AM\\" is Christ, is Buddha, is Emptiness itself: such is the startling testimony of the world's great mystics and sages.\\" Ken Wilber, A Brief History of Everything, ch. 12, p.197-199 He adds that the self is not an Emergent, but an aspect present from the start as the basic form of awareness, but which becomes increasingly obvious and self-aware \\"as growth and transcendence matures.\\" As Depth increases, consciousness shines forth more noticeably, until: :\\"shed[ding] its lesser identification with both the body and the mind ... in each case from matter to body to mind to Spirit... consciousness or the observing Self sheds an exclusive identity with a lesser and shallower dimension, and opens up to deeper and higher and wider occasions, until it opens up to its own ultimate ground in Spirit itself. And the stages of transpersonal growth and development are basically the stages of following this Observing Self to its ultimate abode, which is pure Spirit or pure Emptiness, the ground, path and fruition of the entire display.\\" In a similar vein, Evelyn UnderhillEvelyn Underhill, \\"Mysticism: A Study in Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness, Section III, P. 55. states: See also * Aseity * Atman (Buddhism) * Atman (Hinduism) * Ego (spirituality) * Holy Guardian Angel (Thelema) * Maya (illusion) * Nondual * Psychology of self * Samsara * Soul * Spirituality * Tazkiah References Conceptions of self Religious philosophy ","title":"Religious views on the self"},{"id":"9774222","text":"Angelicuss is the first Romanian LGBT magazine and is published by Be An Angel, an LGBT rights organisation from Cluj-Napoca.

As the name suggests, its bodywork is just an entirely flat, level 'bed' with no sides or roof. This allows for quick and easy loading of goods, and consequently they are used to transport heavy loads that are not delicate or vulnerable to rain, and also for abnormal loads that require more space than is available on a closed body.  Road trucks  International Harvester flatbed truck A flatbed has a solid bed, usually of wooden planks. There is no roof and no fixed sides. To retain the load there are often low sides which may be hinged down for loading, as a 'drop-side' truck. A 'stake truck' has no sides but has steel upright pillars, which may be removable, again used to retain the load. A modern flatbed with an unusual load, held down by webbing ratchet straps Loads are retained by being manually tied down with ropes. The bed of a flatbed truck has tie-down hooks around its edge and techniques such as a trucker's hitch are used to tighten them. Weather protection is optionally provided by manually 'sheeting' the load with a tarpaulin, held down by ropes. These manual loading techniques are slow and require some care and skill. There is also the risk that an improperly secured load may be shed in transit, often leading to accidents or road blockages. There is also little theft protection for such a load. The slowness of loading loads like this led to the development of more efficient truck designs with enclosed bodies. Some improvement was made with the general replacement of ropes by flat webbing straps, tightened with a ratchet. These reduced the skill of 'roping up' and improved the control of tension, leading to fewer shed loads. = Decline of flatbeds = Flatbeds became rare in the 1980s as the majority of road freight changed to either containers or pallet loads carried on larger and more efficient trucks, optimised for quicker loading by fork-lift trucks. Containers are carried on specialised semi-trailers with twistlocks in the corners to retain the container. Pallet loads are carried in either box bodies, loaded through rear doors, or curtain-sided bodies loaded through the sides. Both of these protect loads from the weather and can be quickly loaded with standard loads, but are more restrictive for single bulky loads, loaded by crane. The haulage and logistics business also changed around the same time as a greater proportion became more regular in nature, such as standard daily loads of equally-sized boxes from a distribution centre to a supermarket, rather than the unpredictable ad hoc nature or earlier road transport. Flatbeds are still in use, but are now used for more specialised cargoes, such as constructional steelwork or lighter abnormal loads, such as machinery, lumber loads/dry wall or any load that requires use of a forklift without the use of a loading dock. Low loaders, for construction machinery and heavy plant vehicles, are not considered as flatbeds. Neither are abnormal load carriers for heavy haulage. = Configuration/design in US trailers = In North America, the length is commonly 48 feet or 53 feet, and the width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups can only be legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame can be one of 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), ever-popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be flatter, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a step deck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a \\"hitchhiker\\" type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or \\"headache rack\\" is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement at the front of the deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory, they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming through the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver. 48- and 53-foot lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 feet apart at the rear \\"California spread\\" in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). The so-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take a far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk. The driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease the turning radius of the rig for easy maneuvering in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty/deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains, as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull-on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale. When the driver learns how to interpret the scale properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty, he can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, the driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid a ticket) (80,000 pounds without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop-up chain systems which have a higher WLL (working load limit) than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify the options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang are allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of impending danger of impalement if they follow too closely behind and the truck suddenly stops. In extreme cases, permit loads require an escort vehicle in the front, rear, or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment. = Tow trucks = Ford F-650 flatbed tow truck Some vehicle recovery tow trucks have flat beds and are able to winch a recovered vehicle entirely on board. They can then drive the vehicle away for repair without needing to tow it. This allows a faster journey, does not require a driver in the vehicle being towed, and allows a damaged vehicle to be recovered when it cannot be towed. As these flat beds usually slope gradually to the rear, unlike the level bed of a cargo flatbed, they are known as 'beavertails'. Some tow truck beds are demountable and may be lowered behind the truck for easy loading, then both bed and load winched back aboard as one.  Railway flatbeds  Railways also employ flatbed trucks in engineering trains and freight trains. In Britain and the Commonwealth the term bogie flat is often applied to a bogie flatbed truck. Although less common, flatbed railway trucks on rigid frames and axles are sometimes used, with both 4-wheel and 6-wheel versions being extant. In British English, the term 'truck' most commonly relates to railway vehicles, with the word 'lorry' more commonly applied to road vehicles.

Jones is a researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the Institute for Neuroscience. Her interests are in neural plasticity across the lifespan, motor skill learning, mechanisms of brain and behavioral adaptation to brain damage, and glial-neuronal interactions. Her research is on the brain changes following stroke, in particular rehabilitation strategies and the brain changes associated with them. She primarily tests rats and uses the Endothelin-1 stroke model. Her most recent work has expanded into the field of microstimulation mapping of the rat cortex.  Early life and education  Theresa Jones was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on November 1, 1964. Throughout her childhood, her family moved around to Little Rock, Arkansas, Berkley Heights, New Jersey, and St. Louis Missouri. She went to school as an undergraduate student at the University of Missouri. She began studying towards a major in general humanities, but she quickly found interest in the biological aspect of psychology. After leaving the University of Missouri in 1986, she went on to finish her Bachelor's degree in Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin in 1987. Theresa Jones enrolled in a graduate Biopsychology program at the University of Texas at Austin under the mentorship of Timothy Schallert. She received her doctoral degree in 1992 for her research on neural plasticity mechanisms of recovery after brain injury. Wanting to continue her studies in brain plasticity, she became a postdoctoral fellow in Behavioral Neuroscience and Biopsychology at the Beckman Institute of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of William Greenough until 1996.  Career and research  Theresa Jones became an assistant professor in the Psychology Department and Neurobiology and Behavior Program at the University of Washington in 1996. In 2001, she moved to an assistant professor position at her alma mater, in the Psychology Department and Institute for Neuroscience at the University of Texas at Austin. After two years as an assistant professor, Theresa Jones was promoted to an associate professor position for five years, then a full professor in 2008.

Virtualization hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from the users, presenting instead an abstract computing platform. At its origins, the software that controlled virtualization was called a \\"control program\\", but the terms \\"hypervisor\\" or \\"virtual machine monitor\\" became preferred over time.  Concept  The term \\"virtualization\\" was coined in the 1960s to refer to a virtual machine (sometimes called \\"pseudo machine\\"), a term which itself dates from the experimental IBM M44/44X system. The creation and management of virtual machines has been called \\"platform virtualization\\", or \\"server virtualization\\", more recently. Platform virtualization is performed on a given hardware platform by host software (a control program), which creates a simulated computer environment, a virtual machine (VM), for its guest software. The guest software is not limited to user applications; many hosts allow the execution of complete operating systems. The guest software executes as if it were running directly on the physical hardware, with several notable caveats. Access to physical system resources (such as the network access, display, keyboard, and disk storage) is generally managed at a more restrictive level than the host processor and system-memory. Guests are often restricted from accessing specific peripheral devices, or may be limited to a subset of the device's native capabilities, depending on the hardware access policy implemented by the virtualization host. Virtualization often exacts performance penalties, both in resources required to run the hypervisor, and as well as in reduced performance on the virtual machine compared to running native on the physical machine.  Reasons for virtualization  * In the case of server consolidation, many small physical servers are replaced by one larger physical server to decrease the need for more (costly) hardware resources such as CPUs, and hard drives. Although hardware is consolidated in virtual environments, typically OSs are not. Instead, each OS running on a physical server is converted to a distinct OS running inside a virtual machine. Thereby, the large server can \\"host\\" many such \\"guest\\" virtual machines. This is known as Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) transformation. * In addition to reducing equipment and labor costs associated with equipment maintenance, consolidating servers can also have the added benefit of reducing energy consumption and the global footprint in environmental-ecological sectors of technology. For example, a typical server runs at 425 W Profiling Energy Usage for Efficient Consumption; Rajesh Chheda, Dan Shookowsky, Steve Stefanovich, and Joe Toscano and VMware estimates a hardware reduction ratio of up to 15:1.VMware server consolidation overview * A virtual machine (VM) can be more easily controlled and inspected from a remote site than a physical machine, and the configuration of a VM is more flexible. This is very useful in kernel development and for teaching operating system courses, including running legacy operating systems that do not support modern hardware.Examining VMware Dr. Dobb‚Äôs Journal August 2000 By Jason Nieh and Ozgur Can Leonard * A new virtual machine can be provisioned as required without the need for an up- front hardware purchase. * A virtual machine can easily be relocated from one physical machine to another as needed. For example, a salesperson going to a customer can copy a virtual machine with the demonstration software to their laptop, without the need to transport the physical computer. Likewise, an error inside a virtual machine does not harm the host system, so there is no risk of the OS crashing on the laptop. * Because of this ease of relocation, virtual machines can be readily used in disaster recovery scenarios without concerns with impact of refurbished and faulty energy sources. However, when multiple VMs are concurrently running on the same physical host, each VM may exhibit varying and unstable performance which highly depends on the workload imposed on the system by other VMs. This issue can be addressed by appropriate installation techniques for temporal isolation among virtual machines. There are several approaches to platform virtualization. Examples of virtualization use cases: * Running one or more applications that are not supported by the host OS: A virtual machine running the required guest OS could permit the desired applications to run, without altering the host OS. * Evaluating an alternate operating system: The new OS could be run within a VM, without altering the host OS. * Server virtualization: Multiple virtual servers could be run on a single physical server, in order to more fully utilize the hardware resources of the physical server. * Duplicating specific environments: A virtual machine could, depending on the virtualization software used, be duplicated and installed on multiple hosts, or restored to a previously backed-up system state. * Creating a protected environment: If a guest OS running on a VM becomes damaged in a way that is not cost-effective to repair, such as may occur when studying malware or installing badly behaved software, the VM may simply be discarded without harm to the host system, and a clean copy used upon rebooting the guest .  Full virtualization  Logical diagram of full virtualization. In full virtualization, the virtual machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified \\"guest\\" OS designed for the same instruction set to be run in isolation. This approach was pioneered in 1966 with the IBM CP-40 and CP-67, predecessors of the VM family.  Hardware- assisted virtualization  In hardware-assisted virtualization, the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest OSs to be run in isolation.Uhlig, R. et al.; \\"Intel virtualization technology,\\" Computer , vol.38, no.5, pp. 48-56, May 2005 Hardware-assisted virtualization was first introduced on the IBM System/370 in 1972, for use with VM/370, the first virtual machine operating system. In 2005 and 2006, Intel and AMD provided additional hardware to support virtualization. Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) added similar features in their UltraSPARC T-Series processors in 2005. In 2006, first- generation 32- and 64-bit x86 hardware support was found to rarely offer performance advantages over software virtualization.A Comparison of Software and Hardware Techniques for x86 Virtualization, Keith Adams and Ole Agesen, VMware, ASPLOS‚Äô06 21‚Äì25 October 2006, San Jose, California, USA \\"Surprisingly, we find that the first-generation hardware support rarely offers performance advantages over existing software techniques. We ascribe this situation to high VMM/guest transition costs and a rigid programming model that leaves little room for software flexibility in managing either the frequency or cost of these transitions.\\"  Paravirtualization  In paravirtualization, the virtual machine does not necessarily simulate hardware, but instead (or in addition) offers a special API that can only be used by modifying the \\"guest\\" OS. For this to be possible, the \\"guest\\" OS's source code must be available. If the source code is available, it is sufficient to replace sensitive instructions with calls to VMM APIs (e.g.: \\"cli\\" with \\"vm_handle_cli()\\"), then re-compile the OS and use the new binaries. This system call to the hypervisor is called a \\"hypercall\\" in TRANGO and Xen; it is implemented via a DIAG (\\"diagnose\\") hardware instruction in IBM's CMS under VM (which was the origin of the term hypervisor)..  Operating-system-level virtualization  In operating-system-level virtualization, a physical server is virtualized at the operating system level, enabling multiple isolated and secure virtualized servers to run on a single physical server. The \\"guest\\" operating system environments share the same running instance of the operating system as the host system. Thus, the same operating system kernel is also used to implement the \\"guest\\" environments, and applications running in a given \\"guest\\" environment view it as a stand-alone system.  Hardware virtualization disaster recovery  A disaster recovery (DR) plan is often considered good practice for a hardware virtualization platform. DR of a virtualization environment can ensure high rate of availability during a wide range of situations that disrupt normal business operations. In situations where continued operations of hardware virtualization platforms is important, a disaster recovery plan can ensure hardware performance and maintenance requirements are met. A hardware virtualization disaster recovery plan involves both hardware and software protection by various methods, including those described below. ; Tape backup for software data long-term archival needs : This common method can be used to store data offsite, but data recovery can be a difficult and lengthy process. Tape backup data is only as good as the latest copy stored. Tape backup methods will require a backup device and ongoing storage material. ; Whole-file and application replication : The implementation of this method will require control software and storage capacity for application and data file storage replication typically on the same site. The data is replicated on a different disk partition or separate disk device and can be a scheduled activity for most servers and is implemented more for database-type applications. ; Hardware and software redundancy : This method ensures the highest level of disaster recovery protection for a hardware virtualization solution, by providing duplicate hardware and software replication in two distinct geographic areas.

It is a remake and sequel of sorts to Dohler's first film The Alien Factor. The story concerns a small town sheriff who must stop a rampaging alien from killing the residents of Perry Hall, Maryland. Plot A small alien spaceship is cruising around the solar system. When it reaches the vicinity of Earth, it is struck by an asteroid and crashes at night in the small town of Perry Hall. Some hunters hear the impact and alert County Sheriff Cinder. When they go investigating on their own, however, the pilot emerges and kills them with a disintegrator ray. The beast also attacks a couple in their home, and a family out for a drive. Cinder confronts the beast with his men and some armed residents including a man named Jamie. However, the beast appears invulnerable to bullets and they lose many men to the disintegrator. The next morning, they enlist the help of an expert marksman who shoots off the disintegrator, disarming the beast. However, the marksman's son and another officer perish during the shootout. The police department begin evacuating the town. However, they are unable to convince mayor Bert Wicker to cancel his party for governor Embry. Meanwhile, a delinquent named Drago abuses his girlfriend, who has been sleeping with Jamie. The police then arrive to give her the evacuation order, and after they leave, Drago returns and strangles the girl. When Cinder's police find out that Wicker's party is in progress, Jamie bluffs that poison gas is escaping from a nearby mine and the partygoers flee in panic. Wicker and his secretary Mary Jane, dispirited by this turn of events, stay home and begin drinking heavily. At the office of doctor Steven Price, the beast appears and kills a few men. Price and nurse Ruth hide in the basement, and devise a trap to electrocute the beast with some frayed electrical cord. It works, and the beast flees the building. The body of Drago's girl gets discovered and taken to Price; Jamie, suspecting Drago, goes out on his dirt bike and beats him. Soon after, Cinder and his deputy Lisa discover a mutilated corpse, and the beast shows up. Lisa and Cinder make their escape, and the sheriff injures his leg in the process. Lisa takes him to her house to heal, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Wicker and Mary Jane have gotten very drunk. Price is sent to watch over them until they can be evacuated. However, the beast gets past Price and kills Mary Jane in the basement. Her screams wake Wicker, and the beast rips his head off when he investigates. Cinder arrives afterwards, and Jamie suggests electrocuting the beast with a high-voltage coil from the local power plant. Price, thinking back to his success with the electrical trap, supports this course of action, and the sheriff drives out to the power plant with his men. There, Drago assaults Ruth and Cinder, but is stopped when Jamie shoots him with a shotgun. Cinder and his crew return to Wicker's house and begin setting up their trap, laying metal wire between the trees and connecting it to the coil, which will discharge when they throw the circuit breakers. The beast takes them by surprise, and Jamie must hold onto the wire to keep it inside the trap. They throw the breakers, and the surge makes the beast explode, and takes Jamie with it as well. The camera pans up to the stars overhead and the film ends. Production Most of the cast of The Alien Factor reprise their roles in Nightbeast. Nightbeast features opening credit effects by Ernest D. Farino, and the creature was created by John Dods. J. J. Abrams worked on the film as a 16-year-old. Abrams became aware of Dohler from the latter's articles in a local film magazine, Cinemagic. After Dohler and Abrams exchanged correspondence, Dohler asked Abrams if he would be interested in scoring the film. The film was shot in Baltimore, Maryland. Abrams, who lived in Los Angeles, mailed the tapes to Dohler. Release Nightbeast was first released on DVD Sep 28, 2004, by Troma and was later released on DVD February 24, 2009 along with Blood, Boobs & Beast, a documentary about Don Dohler's life and career. Reception TV Guide panned the film, awarding it one out of four stars, stating, \\"Although the special effects (including some startling uses of gore makeup) are noteworthy, the actors aren't given much to do other than stand around and talk. The final result is disappointing\\". Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News wrote, \\"All in all, Nightbeast is drive-in, beer-swilling, audience-heckling fun.\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it \\"an angry middle aged man's cry for attention\\". It has become a cult film. In August 2016, Nightbeast was featured on Rooster Teeth's Theater Mode web show. Nightbeast was featured in a RedLetterMedia Halloween special in 2013. Among other things, the group discussed the film's similarity to Dohler's other work, hokey acting, and improved special effects. Mike Stoklasa called Nightbeast, \\"just a terrible film.\\" Nightbeast is briefly seen playing on television in Panos Cosmatos' 2018 film Mandy.

Out of this society grew the Guild of Film Art Directors, and the present British Film Designers Guild, who now include in their membership all the various branches of the Art Department. They are not a trade union. The British equivalent of the Art Directors Guild (of America), although smaller in size are one of the key organisations in the Cine Guilds of Great Britain that work directly with the UK Government: Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.DCMS This Guild is presented primarily to assist Producers and others to select Department members who will maintain the highest standards of Art Direction, even on the smallest of productions, and whose knowledge, experience and talent have been proven to be the highest in a medium where four-fifths of the spectators' attention is visual. The British Film Designers Guild has members in every grade of the art department, from draughtspersons to costume designers, set decorators to production designers, and was formed with the aim of raising the standards and the profile of the art department and protecting the interest of its members. Art Department positions The hierarchy in the United Kingdom does have some title variants with job descriptions. Here is a guide to the main positions within each area, as there are many alternatives dependent on the film requirements and to which country the film is based in.

Latterly he took part in a research project on causes of peat fires and their consequences in carbon emissions in the Indonesian province of Central Kalimantan. Among his methodological contributions was the development of progressive contextualization, an effects-to-causes approach to examining and explaining human-environment interactions that he subsequently rejected in part. In the 1990s, a brief critique of political ecology accuses that field of confirmation bias by virtue of prioritizing and searching out the effects of power relations on local land uses and cultures and of not being sufficiently open to other explanations through an abductive, effects-to- causes 'event ecology' approach.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bradley_Walters/publication/226939643_Against_Political_Ecology/links/02bfe50f58bd0671fb000000/Against- Political-Ecology.pdf Event ecology has, in turn, been critiqued.

The , Benjamin batted and threw right-handed, and was born in Framingham, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school, he attended Western Maryland College, now known as McDaniel College, where he played baseball, basketball, and football. In addition to his major league playing career, he played in minor league baseball for ten seasons. He began at the age of 23, with the Thomasville Orioles of the Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League in 1937, and finished as the player-manager for the Fresno Cardinals of the California League in 1948. During that time, he played in 955 minor league games, and batted .304, and hit 52 home runs. In the early 1940s, he was an assistant football coach at Northeastern University. Later, during his minor league career, he began coaching high school football, part- time, in his home town of Framingham, and then full-time once his playing and managing career ended. Starting in 1948, he was the head baseball coach and assistant football coach for Greenfield High School in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and took over the head football coaching duties in 1958. He held both positions, in addition to being a physical education teacher for a local middle school and part-time basketball referee until 1964. In 1965, he was hired as a talent scout for the Houston Astros, a job he held for nearly 40 years. It was his evaluation of Jeff Bagwell that led the Astros to acquire him from the Boston Red Sox for Larry Andersen. Early life Born on May 20, 1914, in Framingham, Massachusetts, Benjamin graduated from Framingham High School in 1932, and later attended Western Maryland College, later renamed McDaniel College, on an athletic scholarship. He played football, basketball, and baseball and claimed to have once competed against Ohio State University track star and Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens. When he was an end on the college's football team, he was presented with the game ball autographed by his teammates after a 12‚Äì6 victory over Boston College. Career =Minor leagues= Benjamin signed his first professional baseball contract with the Thomasville Orioles of the Class D minor league baseball Georgia‚ÄìFlorida League in 1937. He played for this team for the 1937 and 1938 seasons as their third baseman. In 1937, he batted .310, and hit one home run. In 97 games played during the 1938 season, he batted .348, hit 32 doubles, 12 triples, and three home runs. For the 1939 season, he joined the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class A1 Southern Association as an outfielder; he batted .323, and hit 27 doubles, eight triples, and five home runs in 135 games played. It was at the conclusion of this minor league season, that he became a late-season acquisition of the Philadelphia Phillies. =Major leagues= Benjamin made his Major League Baseball debut on September 16, 1939, with the Phillies, and appeared in 12 games, fielding a variety of positions, including all three outfield positions, and third base as well. He had 50 at bats that season, and collected seven hits for a .140 batting average. The next season, he was optioned by the Phillies to the Baltimore Orioles of the Class AA International League, one of their minor league affiliates, as an outfielder. During the 1940 season, he played in 108 games, batted .304, and hit 16 doubles, seven triples, and 11 home runs. At the conclusion of this season, he was a late-season call-up by the Phillies. He played in eight games and had two hits in nine at bats for a .222 batting average. His most productive major league season came in 1941, when he played a full season with the Phillies. He posted career-highs in home runs (3), RBIs (27), runs scored (47), hits (113), doubles (20), triples (7), stolen bases (17) and games played (129). In a game against the New York Giants on June 28, Benjamin singled to bring home the game-winning run in bottom of the 12th inning. On July 1, he again produced a game-winning single, this time in the bottom of the tenth inning, defeating the Brooklyn Dodgers. He began the 1942 season with the Phillies and batted .224 in 78 games before being sold, on August 5, to the Louisville Colonels, a Class AA American Association affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. =Return to the minors= Benjamin finished the 1942 season with the Colonels as their third baseman. He appeared in 38 games, hit three home runs, and had a .303 batting average. Before the 1943 season, the Red Sox were in need of more outfielders, so manager Joe Cronin gave Benjamin a tryout in mid-March; however, he was not signed, and he continued to play with the Colonels, moving back to the outfield. In 123 games played, he hit just .237, and did not hit a home run. He returned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League for the 1944 season, which had switched its major league affiliation to the Cleveland Indians. He enjoyed a resurgence in his offensive statistics that season, as his batting average rose to .301, and he hit 24 doubles, eight triples, and 12 home runs in 133 games played. The Indians called up Benjamin for the 1945 season, and even though he was part of their regular roster, he appeared in only 14 games, batting .333. On March 26, 1946, he was released by the Cleveland Indians, and he would never appear in another major league game. In his five-season major league career, Benjamin hit .229 with five home runs and 41 RBIs in 241 games. He played for and managed the Nazareth Cement Dusters of the Class D North Atlantic League. He played several different positions that season, including two games at pitcher. He batted .312 and hit four home runs during his only season with the Cement Dusters. Benjamin played for several different teams in 1947, beginning the season with the Houston Buffaloes, a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, but later joined the San Antonio Missions, a St. Louis Browns affiliate. Both teams were in the Texas League. Late in the season, the Browns promoted him to their Class AAA team, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. In 1948, he played for, and managed, the Fresno Cardinals of the Class C California League, an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 125 games played that season, he batted .326 and hit 27 doubles, five triples, and nine home runs. After the season completed, he retired as a player. Post-playing career =High school athletics= After his baseball playing career ended, he moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and became an assistant football coach at Greenfield High School, while also working as a physical education teacher at a nearby middle school. Benjamin was Greenfield's head football coach from 1958 to 1964, as well as the head baseball coach from 1948 to 1964. He coached the baseball team to several Western Massachusetts championships. Among the other duties, he also refereed high school and college basketball games in New England, as well as working as an assistant football coach at Deerfield Academy in 1964 and 1965. He was also an assistant football coach for Northeastern University in the early 1940s. =Scouting career= Benjamin began his career as a talent scout for the Houston Astros in 1965, and stayed in that capacity until retiring in 2002. During his time with the Astros franchise he scouted amateur players in the New England region, as well as the American League East teams and their minor league affiliates. He later became the team's scouting supervisor for the Northeast. He also scouted major league teams during spring training in Florida and spent many summer evenings evaluating some of the nation's best college players in the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1970, Mike Flanagan was suffering arm problems, and many scouts decided that he did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and wait to see if his arm would recuperate. The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in. Personal life Benjamin was married to his wife Barbara, maiden name Hall, from 1941 until her death 54 years later in 1995. She was attending Framingham State Teachers College when they met, and school rules forbade female students from getting married or they faced expulsion. Town records did not publish marriages until after January 1, each year, so the couple got married at 1 a.m. on New Year's Day 1941 at her home in Raynham, Massachusetts. This prevented the school from learning about her marriage until after she had graduated. The Benjamins had one son, Richard, and three daughters, Nancy, Janice, and Joanne; as well as 12 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren. Benjamin died at the age of 95, of heart failure, in his daughter's home on December 24, 2009, in Harwich, Massachusetts. He is interred at Green River Cemetery in Greenfield, Massachusetts. Benjamin was a member of both the McDaniel College and Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association hall of fame, and in 2008, he received a special recognition award from the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation. Tal Smith, Astros' president of baseball operations, said of Benjamin, \\"Stan's positive evaluation of Bagwell was definitely a catalyst in our taking him... He was a vital cog in our organization who had the ability to convey his opinion in a precise manner. You always knew where you stood with him. He was a longtime employee, but more important, a longtime friend. Smith also called him a \\"keen judge of talent.\\" References External links 1914 births 2009 deaths Baltimore Orioles (IL) players Baseball players from Massachusetts Chattanooga Lookouts players Cleveland Indians players Fresno Cardinals players Houston Astros scouts Houston Buffaloes players Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Major League Baseball right fielders McDaniel Green Terror baseball players McDaniel Green Terror football players McDaniel Green Terror men's basketball players Northeastern Huskies football coaches People from Framingham, Massachusetts People from Greenfield, Massachusetts Philadelphia Phillies players Philadelphia Phillies scouts San Antonio Missions players Toledo Mud Hens players American men's basketball players Framingham High School alumni ","title":"Stan Benjamin"},{"id":"9774453","text":"A kusamono made of plants from Connecticut, during the summer A shitakusa of miniature hosta (front left) as part of a formal bonsai display Kusamono (literally \\"grass thing\\") and shitakusa (literally \\"undergrass\\") are a potted collection of plants designed to be viewed either in accompaniment with bonsai or alone.

The systems fall under the categories of: *direct combustion, *gasification, *combined heat and power (CHP), *anaerobic digestion, *aerobic digestion. Benefits of biomass heating The use of biomass in heating systems is beneficial because it uses agricultural, forest, urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and/or electricity with less effect on the environment than fossil fuels. This type of energy production has a limited long-term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural carbon cycle; while the carbon in fossil fuels is not, and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel (carbon footprint). Historically, before the use of fossil fuels in significant quantities, biomass in the form of wood fuel provided most of humanity's heating. Forest Health Because forest based biomass is typically derived from wood that has lower commercial value, forest biomass is typically harvested as a byproduct of other timber harvest operations. Biomass heating provides markets for lower value wood, which enables healthy and profitable forest management. In New England as of 2017, one of the greatest threats to forest health is conversion from forest to agriculture and development. Harvard Forest scientists reported in 2017, that 65 acres of forest were being lost per day by conversion. By providing markets for low grade wood, the value of forests is enhanced, which makes conversion to housing or agriculture less likely. Drawbacks of biomass heating On a large scale, the use of agricultural biomass removes agricultural land from food production, reduces the carbon sequestration capacity of forests that are not managed sustainably, and extracts nutrients from the soil. Combustion of biomass creates air pollutants and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades. The time delay between when biomass is burned and the time when carbon is pulled from the atmosphere as a plant or tree grows to replace it is known as carbon debt. The concept of carbon debt is subject to debate. Actual carbon impacts may be subject to philosophy, scale of harvest, land type, biomass type (grass, maize, new wood, waste wood, algae, for example), soil type, and other factors. Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, NOx (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas. Black carbon ‚Äì a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass ‚Äì is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming.2009 State of the World, Into a Warming World,Worldwatch Institute, 56‚Äì57, In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning.Science, 2009, 323, 495 Researchers measured a significant concentration of 14C, which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.Biomass burning leads to Asian brown cloud, Chemical & Engineering News, 87, 4, 31 Modern biomass burning appliances dramatically reduce harmful emissions with advanced technology such as oxygen trim systems. On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2). The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight. When from agricultural sources, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed. The forest biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree‚Äôs carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Some studies indicate that \\"even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage\\" and \\"the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest\\".Edmunds, Joe; Richard Richets; Marshall Wise, \\"Future Fossil Fuel Carbon Emissions without Policy Intervention: A Review\\". In T. M. L. Wigley, David Steven Schimel, The carbon cycle. Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp.171‚Äì189 Other studies show that carbon storage is dependent upon the forest and the use of the harvested biomass. Forests are often managed for multiple aged trees with more frequent, smaller harvests of mature trees. These forests interact with carbon differently than mature forests that are clear-cut. Also, the more efficient the conversion of wood to energy, the less wood that is used and shorter the carbon cycle will be. Biomass heating in our world Biomass heating system for one building complex in the Spanish Basque Country The oil price increases since 2003 and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation. Forest renderings, agricultural waste, and crops grown specifically for energy production become competitive as the prices of energy dense fossil fuels rise. Efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of regenerating mismanaged croplands and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized, multi-dimensional renewable energy industry. Efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the European Union through the 2000s. In other areas of the world, inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to environmental degradation. Buffer tanks Buffer tanks store the hot water the biomass appliance generates and circulates it around the heating system. Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as Carbon monoxide, dust, and NOx, greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output ‚Äì in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The residual heat from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. Light weight, fast response boilers require only 10L/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40L/kW. Types of biomass heating systems heating plant in Austria; the heat power is about 1000 kW The use of Biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings, and all have different uses. There are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler. The types are Fully Automated, Semi-Automated, Pellet-Fired, and Combined Heat and Power. =Fully automated= In fully automated systems chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank. A system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate. This rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in. The system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler. Fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer, and not the transport of wood while offering comprehensive and cost effective solutions to complex industrial challenges. =Semi-automated or \\"surge bin\\"= Semi-automated or \\"Surge Bin\\" systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational. They have smaller holding tanks, and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation. The reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system. The heat created by the combustor can be used to directly heat the air or it can be used to heat water in a boiler system which acts as the medium by which the heat is delivered. Wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity, and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year. Considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year, it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency. =Pellet-fired= The third main type of biomass heating systems are pellet-fired systems. Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them more expensive. Although they are more expensive, they are much more condensed and uniform, and therefore are more efficient. Further, it is relatively easy to automatically feed pellets to boilers. In these systems, the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo, and gravity is used to move them to the boiler. The storage requirements are much smaller for pellet- fired systems because of their condensed nature, which also helps cut down costs. these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities, but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited, and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility. Agricultural pellet systems One subcategory of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, straw pellets). One of this kind is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber. In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40 ¬∞C, instead of 120 ¬∞C before sent into the flue. =Combined heat and power= Combined heat and power systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as wood chips, is used to generate power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost. There are certain situations where CHP is a good option. Wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood, and a need for both heat and power. Other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons, which need energy, and heat for hot water. These systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed, and a cooling tower is not needed.

Construction began in 1230 and is still unfinished, since the western front is still missing its northern belfry. Because of its long period of construction, the church combines romanesque, gothic and baroque architecture. The church has never been a bishop's seat, and therefore is not a cathedral in the English sense. The German term for \\"cathedral\\", Dom, often includes churches that lack a cathedra (a bishop's throne) and instead refers to any large medieval church. In Wetzlar, the main church has been called a Dom since the 17th century. In 897, Rudolf I, Bishop of W√ºrzburg consecrated a Salvator Church replacing an older church on the same location. In the early 10th century it became a Collegiate church devoted to St. Mary. Around 1170 the church was rebuilt into a romanesque basilica with two western spires. Parts of the western portal are still visible in the contemporary building. After 1230, the cathedral was rebuilt and extended again. Construction lasted until 1490 and remained unfinished. The church became a Hall church with two towers. Construction of the northern spire was started but abandoned long before completion (see image). The southern tower's steep pinnacle was made of wood and was destroyed by a fire in 1561. It was replaced by the baroque tower roof still extant today. In World War II the cathedral was damaged by bombs. Most of the damage was repairable, but the precious stained glass windows and the organ were lost and had to be replaced by modern equipment. Since the 16th century, Wetzlar Cathedral has been used as a simultaneum by both Roman Catholics (whose congregations form part of today's Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg) and Protestants, respectively.

He was born in 1948. He majored in criminology at UC Berkeley, where he was a gymnast, a gold medalist on the pommel horse and a member of the 1968 NCAA national championship team along with Dan Millman (Way of the Peaceful Warrior). He then completed another round of studies in music at UCLA. His performance beginnings were in American Roots music where Tepp learned his trade directly from masters such as Johnny Shines, Bukka White, Earl Hooker, John Lee Hooker, Sippie Wallace, Magic Sam and Shakey Jake Harris. His first instrumental acclaim came on harmonica and clarinet. Working out of Los Angeles, he transitioned to folk, rock and songwriter based music in the mid-1970s, performing or recording with Bonnie Raitt, Iain Matthews, Danny O'Keefe and Spencer Davis Wendy Waldman and others. At this same time, Joel's slide guitar work began to attract attention as well. While certainly facile in traditional blues and rock styles on that instrument, he has gradually developed a signature sound that includes elements of pedal steel and other various unusual harmonics and voicings. Other activities in the Los Angeles music scene included his stint as the MC at The Troubadour for the legendary Monday night talent showcases. In conjunction with his partner Matt Kramer, the two introduced or previewed many artists who have become mainstays in the music world including Tom Waits, Rikki Lee Jones, Karla Bonoff, Billy Vera and Gail Davies, among many others. Today, Joel resides in Seattle and is a familiar face as a multi-instrument accompanist at Northwest concerts, in California, Kerrville and elsewhere. He still regularly adds his slide guitar, harmonica and clarinet playing to the music of Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, Danny O'Keefe, Caroline Aiken and many others. His recording credits include Jerry Garcia, Crazy Horse, John David Souther, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, several major films, television shows and much more. His slide guitar workshops and classes on the Art of Accompaniment are often parts of various music festivals, particularly on the West Coast. In addition to his work as a musician, Joel Tepp is a financial advisor and father of Rhea Tepp, an experimental artist/musician who performs in the project Lilacs and is co- founder of L.A.

The title Thud Ridge derives from the nickname given by F-105 pilots to the Tam Dao range, which was both a waypoint during air attacks in the vicinity of Hanoi, North Vietnam, and a terrain masking feature for ingressing fighters.Broughton, Jack (1969). Thud Ridge, J. B. Lippincott Company. ASIN: B000NQII28, p.xii. (2006 Crecy paperback reprint entitled Thud Ridge: F-105 Thunderchief missions over Vietnam, .) The book set a style that was followed over the next several decades by a spate of gritty memoirs by air veterans of the Vietnam War. Broughton's book is unique to the extent that it was described as \\"history in the making\\" by Hanson W. Baldwin of the New York Times. Inspiration and publication The book is based on Broughton's tour of duty between September 1966 and June 1967 as Vice Commander of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The narrative is anecdotal in nature, a commentary of his observations of persons, aircraft, and events during his tour, more or less chronologically, but without dated references. Few individuals are identified by other than first or nicknames, but Broughton develops most as characters through descriptions of their career backgrounds. Broughton's accounts of missions \\"up north\\" were enhanced in both accuracy and verisimilitude by verbatim transcriptions of radio transmissions he recorded using a small tape recorder mounted in the cockpit of his aircraft.Broughton (1969). p. 39. In Thud Ridge Broughton is highly critical of the U.S. command structure directing air operations against North Vietnam. He blames micromanagement by the highest levels in Washington down to the Thirteenth Air Force, a command echelon based in the Philippines, for losses of men and aircraft that he characterizes as \\"astronomical\\" and \\"worthless.\\" He is particularly critical, however, of the \\"bomber mentality\\" management by generals who came up through the Strategic Air Command and then occupied key command slots in the war, which was being fought by pilots of the Tactical Air Command.Broughton (1969), p. 16. The book came about when, at the completion of his tour of duty, Broughton and two of his pilots were court martialed by the USAF for allegedly conspiring to violate the rules of engagement regarding U.S. air operations. Although acquitted of the most serious charges, Broughton, who had been personally relieved of duty by Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. John D. Ryan, was subsequently transferred to an obscure post in the Pentagon,Project \\"leader\\" of a one-man vertical takeoff and landing study, Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), DARPA. allegedly as a vendetta because his punishment was so slight. Required by office protocol to work only two or three days a month, he used both his extra time and his bitterness at the Air Force to compose Thud Ridge while he awaited approval of an application to appeal of his conviction to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. After his conviction was overturned and expunged from his record because of \\"undue command influence,\\" Broughton retired from the Air Force in August 1968 and had the memoir published by J. B. Lippincott.Broughton, Jack (2007). Rupert Red Two: A Fighter Pilot's Life from Thunderbolts to Thunderchiefs, Zenith Press, , pp. 331-332.

The robot is designed to perform everyday tasks around the house., March 05, 1983, Credit: Corbis, Getty Images The robots were sold commercially starting in early 1983, and were intended to be inexpensive, lacking a complicated manipulating device. Units are beige molded plastic with two drive wheels as feet and stand about 36 inches tall. Arms on Topo 1 and 2 fold out, but Topo 3 lacks arms altogether. Operation is based on one of two programming languages, either Apple BASIC, a modified version of the Logo language, or a version of Forth. Communication is via a radio or infrared transmitter attached to a personal computer. Topo 2 and 3 use an infrared transmitter, and can be controlled by a four way pad on the top of their head that also serves as the infrared receiver. In its final versions, Topo abilities include a text-to-speech processor, so that users can program their robots to wander around the house and speak to humans. However, a fourth model was made but it never went into production (a Topo IV sheet was mailed during the final days of Androbot). It is more like the Brains On Board (B.O.B., an unreleased robot that was produced after the Topo series) robot than a Topo.

She was a member of the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist union Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden. Her followers consider her a pioneer in the field of women's rights and feminism. Her personal motto was \\"I dream of the day when every new born child is welcome, when men and women are equal, and when sexuality is an expression of intimacy, joy and tenderness.\\" Life and career A vicar's daughter, Ottar was born as Elise Ottesen in the municipality of H√∏yland (incorporated into Sandnes in 1965) in Rogaland county, Norway. She was Immanuel Ottesen and Karen Arselle Essendrop's 17th out of 18 children, and as was customary in Norway at that time she was named Elise after her sister who died as an infant the year before.Linder, Doris H (1996). Seksualpolitikk og kvinnekamp : historien om Elise Ottesen-Jensen, p. 12. Tiden, Oslo. (In Norwegian) The name Ottar was her journalist pseudonym and was an abbreviation of her last name, but also a reference to the Norwegian Viking chief Ohthere of H√•logaland (Norwegian: Ottar fra H√•logaland).Harbo, Hilde. \\"Elise Ottesen-Jensen kjempet p√• barrikadene for den forbudte prevensjonsopplysningen\\", Aftenposten, Oslo, 7 March 2015. Retrieved on 20 November 2019. (In Norwegian) Later in life, her father sent away her little sister Magnhild to give birth in Denmark, so that she could be forced to give up her child. Maghild was told nothing about pregnancy or birth, and for nine months she feared that her stomach would just split. She committed suicide because of the longing for the child she had to leave behind. For this, Ottar could never forgive her father, and the fate of her sister became a strong driving force for her commitment to the struggle for women's rights. Ottar's dream was to become a dentist, but an explosion in the chemistry laboratory of her high school injured her fingers, spoiling her chances to pursue a dentist career. Instead she started to work in a newspaper, and eventually became a journalist. She had always questioned the preachings of her father, and early arrived at the conclusion that she was not a Christian. She now found that her sympathies were with the socialists, and it was with them she would struggle for the rest of her life. She made several attempts to organize working class women. But soon they started asking her for advice in sexual matters, asking her questions like \\"Do I always have to when my husband wants to?\\", \\"What can I do to avoid getting pregnant?\\". By the end of the First World War, in 1913, Ottar met and developed a close friendship with the Swedish anarcho-syndicalist peace agitator Albert Jensen. They married in 1931, and Elise Ottesen changed her surname to Ottesen-Jensen. When Albert Jensen was expelled from Norway, she came with him to Denmark. There, she gave birth to their child, who died soon after birth. Ottar and Albert moved to Sweden, and she came to know a doctor who amongst other things taught her how to use a diaphragm. She then set out for her first nationwide tour, in Sweden. She travelled from Sk√•ne to Norrland, teaching female workers how to avoid pregnancy. She agitated for the right for women to experience sexual pleasure, for free abortion, for the repealing of the laws against contraceptives, for gay rights, and more. What she did was illegal and she risked harsh penalties. In the 1920s, Ottar was a regular writer for Arbetaren, with her own column focusing on feminist issues. After a disagreements with the other editors of Arbetaren in 1925, she started her own paper, Vi kvinnor. The paper did however not last for long. A few years later, she also wrote for the anarchist magazine Brand. In 1933, Ottar, together with a number of radical medical doctors and trade union representatives, founded the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (, RFSU). She became its first President, and held this post until 1956. Ottesen-Jensen was also one of the founders of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), in 1953. A paper published by RFSU bears the name \\"Ottar\\", to honour Elise Ottesen- Jensen. This paper changed its name to \\"Ottar\\" in 2001, and was earlier known as \\"RFSU bulletin\\". The name Ottar has also been used to name the Norwegian feminist group Kvinnegruppa Ottar, who were officially founded in 2006.L√∏nn√•, Elisabeth. \\"Kvinnegruppa Ottar\\", Store Norske Leksikon, 30 December 2016.

The tanker truck was loaded with 23 tons of highly flammable liquefied propylene. 217 people (including the driver) were killed and 200 more severely burned. Most of the victims were vacationers (both Spanish and foreign tourists) in the Los Alfaques seaside campsite. The campsite is located at km 159 on the N-340 national road, 2 km south of the town of Sant Carles de la R√†pita. It has been renovated since and still exists today.

At 10:15 that day, the truck, driven by 50-year-old Francisco Imbern√≥n Villena, arrived at the state-owned Enpetrol refinery, located at La Pobla de Mafumet, 9 km north of Tarragona, to be loaded with propylene for another state-owned company, Paular (now Repsol), in Puertollano. At 12:05 the truck left the refinery carrying of propylene, nearly 4 tons over the maximum design load of 19.35 tons. The tanker drivers were under instructions to take the smaller N-340 national road instead of the larger A-7 motorway when carrying cargo to Barcelona, in order to avoid the motorway toll. The N-340 was much narrower and more winding than the A-7, and also carried drivers directly through several densely populated areas. On a summer day with temperatures from 20 to 35 ¬∞C (68‚Äì95 ¬∞F), the pressure in the tank would have been . Accident  The disaster occurred at ca. 14:35, while the truck was moving past the Los Alfaques campsite after having travelled . The driver's watch, which was found still attached to the driver's burned wrist, had stopped at 14:36, the time of the explosion. There are several different witness reports as to the events directly preceding the blast, all of which are more or less equally plausible. Some reported the tank was already leaking as it approached the site, or sprang a leak with a loud bang while passing the site, and was then stopped by the driver. Others reported the bang being caused by a blown tire which caused the truck to swerve out of control and strike the wall separating the campsite from the roadside, possibly overturning in the process. In either case, the leaking tanker formed a cloud of gaseous propylene that partially entered the campsite and also drifted on the wind towards a discoth√®que to the northeast. The white cloud attracted the attention of campsite patrons, who approached the cloud with curiosity as it continued to spread. As the cloud began to permeate the crowded discoth√®que, it reached an ignition source and immediately flashed back into the tanker, causing a fire that nearly instantaneously ruptured the weakened tank and ignited the full load of gas. At that time the campsite to the south was crowded with nearly 1,000 vacationers, mostly German and other foreign tourists, packed tightly in trailers and tents. The blast and fireball (which was estimated at over and left a crater) destroyed everything ‚Äì cars, trailers and buildings ‚Äì within a radius, charred everything within a radius, gutting over 90% of the main camping area. The discoth√®que to the northeast, which was later determined to be the likely source of the ignition, was also razed, killing all the staff members inside. Additionally, 34 vehicles and 21 tents were charred, a restaurant partially collapsed, and the tanker truck was broken into three main pieces. Victims and emergency response  The explosion and fireball instantly killed the driver and other people within the area. A total of 157 people died on site as a result of the initial explosion and the subsequent fires and explosions of cars and gas cylinders used by the tourists. Victims were seen with their hair and clothing aflame running into the sea in an attempt to extinguish the flames. In the first 45 minutes after the disaster, the wounded were removed in an uncoordinated fashion with the help of other survivors using their own cars and vans. Locals also provided help and took the wounded to the hospitals. Ambulances and other emergency forces gradually arrived. The Civil Guard and the armed forces searched the devastated camp for survivors. It took three hours until the last wounded was removed and taken to hospital. The burning tanker blocked the road, dividing the injured into two groups, one being taken northwards and the other southwards. On the road to the north, the injured received adequate medical care, once they had reached either the hospitals at Amposta or at Tortosa. At this stage, the final destination of 58 severely burned patients was the Francisco Franco Hospital in Barcelona. 82 severely burned patients were taken south to the La Fe Hospital in Valencia. In most cases no medical steps of any importance were taken during the journey. Several of the injured developed severe shock on the journey and had no measurable blood pressure on arrival. Many of the patients had burns covering more than 90% of their bodies, and most of them died during the following days. Contributing to the high mortality figure was the inappropriate medical care given en route to the hospital.Burn Centre, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden In the week following the disaster, the patients from France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were evacuated to their own countries. 300 people were wounded, some of them severely. 217 people died as a result of the disaster, while the total number of people who died over the following months as a result of their injuries was at least 270. Among them, four were Spaniards, and all the others were foreigners. The official figure for the number of victims is 215.Microsoft Word ‚Äì Sentencia Alfaques.doc . (PDF) . Retrieved on 11 July 2011. Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. Most of them were wearing only swimming suits, and the building where their documents were stored was destroyed in the explosion. There was no DNA test available at that time. As a result of the work done by the forensic teams from the tourists' home countries, all the victims were eventually identified. Seven of the victims remained unidentified until some time later, and they were interred at the cemetery of Tortosa, Tarragona. The bodies of a French family, consisting of a couple and their two children, were returned to France some years later, after compensation had been settled. The bodies of another family of three originating from Colombia were never sent home, and they remain the only foreigners to be interred at the cemetery of Tortosa along with local victims.Diario de C√≥rdoba, 11/07/2003 (in Spanish).

Inquiry  Following the accident, Cisternas Reunidas accepted responsibility for the disaster, but denied any order or prohibition to the drivers to use the motorway instead of the national road, claiming that it was the driver who chose which road to take. Later, some workers at the Tarragona plant stated they heard Imbern√≥n heatedly arguing with someone on the phone and demanding money for the motorway toll. Enpetrol initially declined any responsibility, claiming that the delivery of the cargo was the carrier's responsibility, and they had not received any complaint.Article in Spanish. Traficoadr.com.

The official inquiry identified that the truck had been severely overloaded, and also lacked emergency pressure release valves, which are designed to help prevent a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) in case of a fire. However, these valves were no longer mandatory in 1978, although they previously were. The truck was due for an inspection check-over in 1980, and it had passed the previous inspection. The tank container was manufactured on 13 December 1973 by a workshop from Bilbao,Photos of the tank container at bomberiles.com. Retrieved on 11 July 2011. and at that time it did not meet the requirements for carrying flammable liquids, since it lacked emergency pressure release valves. Therefore, the tank had been used to carry other substances, some of which were highly corrosive. Tests on the remnants of the steel tank revealed microscopic stress cracks consistent with corrosion caused by previous loads of improperly overpressurized anhydrous ammonia. Combined with whether the tanker suffered an impact that caused additional structural damage, these factors likely led to the almost instantaneous rupture of the tank when the flames flashed back into the tanker. Even without safety valves, a structurally sound and properly filled tanker should have been able to maintain structural integrity in a fire long enough to at least allow nearby people to escape. The inquiry also revealed that overloading of tankers was common practice at Enpetrol refineries. The Tarragona facility lacked either a meter to measure the amount of gas dispensed or an automatic shut-off device to prevent overfilling, and consequently most tanks were consistently overloaded. The driver was neither informed of the overloading, nor about the type and class of the cargo, and there was no means for him to check the pressure level of the tank before he departed or to monitor it in transit. He had not attended the hazmat training program for drivers of dangerous goods, because the company considered his experience of twenty years as a truck driver to be sufficient. The inquiry also determined that, between 3 January and 7 July that year, 32 tanks left the Tarragona refinery overloaded, with drivers other than Imbern√≥n.  Aftermath  After the tragedy, the transit of populated areas by vehicles carrying dangerous cargo was prohibited in Spain, and would only be driven at night. In 1982, four employees of ENPETROL and two of Cisternas Reunidas were convicted of criminal negligence, and were sentenced to prison for between one and four years. Later, four of them were released after appealing the Court's decision, and all prison sentences were suspended or reduced. The two companies paid an equivalent of ‚Ç¨13.23 million (not allowing for inflation) as compensation to the victims.  In popular culture  The accident is featured in the 2007 German film Day of Disaster, directed by Peter Keglevic. However, the film is loosely based on real facts, and contains blunders and factual errors, such as cars or registration plates which could only have appeared years later, or the driver spending the night before at home with the already (over)loaded tanker parked in front of his house.  Los Alfaques today  Six months after the tragedy, the completely renovated campsite was reopened to tourists and Los Alfaques continued in operation.Article in Spanish. Traficoadr.com. Retrieved on 11 July 2011. In 2012 the owners of the still-operating Los Alfaques campsite sought relief through Spanish courts under the newly approved \\"Right to Be Forgotten\\" Act passed by Spain, arguing that Google's search results were unfairly weighted towards the 1979 disaster and was driving away their business. The campsite owners protested that even 30 years after the disaster, the top 12 Google search results for \\"Los Alfaques\\" still focused on the 1979 tragedy, including many gruesome thumbnails of burnt human remains, stacked caskets and coroner procedures during cleanup of the campground. The trial was dismissed, with the plaintiffs being informed that they would need to pursue a U.S. lawsuit against Google.

A member of the Labour Party, she is on the left of the party. Education and career Hardstaff went to the University of Manchester where she obtained a degree in German, and then studied at the University of Cologne. Hardstaff worked as a teacher of German and French, first at High Storrs Girls' Grammar School in Sheffield, then at St Peter's Secondary Modern School. In 1971 she was elected as a Labour Party candidate to Sheffield City Council in Walkley ward, becoming a full-time councillor; she served for seven years. In 1977 she went back to work at Knottingley High School, moving in 1979 to the Frecheville School in Sheffield, and from 1986 to the Birley School. At the 1992 UK general election she was the Labour Party candidate for the Sheffield Hallam constituency, but finished third. 1994 European election At the 1994 European Parliament election, Hardstaff was the Labour Party candidate in Lincolnshire and Humberside South. This constituency was made up of seven constituencies for the United Kingdom Parliament, of which six were held by the Conservative Party. The Labour Party considered winning this election would be taking \\"a prize Tory scalp\\". In the end, Hardstaff was elected as Member of the European Parliament with a majority of 13,745. European Parliament She was chosen by her colleagues as Chairwoman of the European Parliamentary Labour Party. In January 1995, she abstained from signing a declaration against a change in Clause IV of the Labour Party constitution, despite 36 Labour MEPs doing so. With an agricultural constituency she took up farming issues, calling for a new approach to food quality after the BSE scandal including stricter regulation of intensive farming. When Lincolnshire was described as a prosperous area, she wrote to object based on the low wages paid to some farmworkers.Letters, New Statesman, 3 April 1998. She was also Vice-Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Parliament and Poland from 1995. For the 1999 European Parliament election, the electoral system was changed to list-based proportional representation. Hardstaff was placed at sixth out of seven on the regional list for Yorkshire and the Humber, a place which made it practically impossible for her to be re-elected; this low placing was attributed to her alliance with the left.Mike Phipps, \\"Euro carve-up dumps left\\", Labour Left Briefing, November 1998. In the election, Labour won only three seats in the region. Sheffield City council In 2002, Hardstaff was elected to Sheffield City Council for a second term, from Walkley ward. In May 2005 she was appointed to the cabinet of Sheffield as member for Children's Services, responsible both for education and for social services to children. She supported plans to bring in a City Academy to replace an existing secondary school, sponsored by a Christian educational charity; she also defended the use of the Private Finance Initiative as a pragmatic way of supporting investment. She left the Sheffield cabinet in May 2006 and in May 2007 was defeated in her re-election bid in Walkley. She stood again in Walkley ward in 2008, but was defeated. At the same election Hardstaff's brother, Chris Tutt, was re-elected to Sheffield City Council, in Mosborough ward, for the Liberal Democrats. Personal life She married in 1964 and had a son and daughter, but divorced in 1977, retaining her married name. Since 2007 she has been married to Rev. Canon Alan Billings, the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, and Deputy Leader from 1980-86 of Sheffield City Council .

Knabe & Co. of Baltimore as a merger between Chickering & Sons of Boston, Haines Brothers, Marshall & Wendell, and Foster, Armstrong & Company, all of Rochester, New York. From 1913 Ampico was one of the leading producers of reproducing pianos, the others being Duo-Art (1913) and Welte-Mignon (1905).

By 1929 Ampico was in essential economic difficulties and was finally taken over by the Aeolian Company, a manufacturer of player pianos and organs. The combined company, known as Aeolian-American Corp., went through several ownership changes before declaring bankruptcy in 1985. Despite the Ampico's decline, the company did not officially close until 1941. The last model introduced was the Ampico Spinet Reproducing Piano, which had all the functionality of a reproducing piano, and although having a low cost of $495, still failed in sales.Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumentenbau, Bd.: 50, Leipzig, 1929‚Äì30, p 240 and 274  Rythmodik Music Corporation  In May 1918, The Music Roll Division of the American Piano Company became a separate company and henceforth was named Rythmodik Music Corporation, based in Belleville, New Jersey.  History  Originally named Despatch after the transportation company that spawned several dozen car shops in the area, the town was also home to a musical manufacturing giant for the better part of the 20th century. Nestled in between the New York Central Railroad tracks and Commercial Street, the 250,000 square-foot edifice designed by Henry Ives was the first industrial building in the United States to be constructed from reinforced concrete. Renowned for its fine craftsmanship, the American Piano Company was the largest distributor and manufacturer of pianos in the world by the mid-1920s. The instrument‚Äôs popularity reached its peak that decade thanks to a growth in prosperity and an increased interest in music stimulated by phonographs and radio. Piano producers across the country would not fare as well the following decade. While over 347,000 pianos were purchased in the United States in 1923, only 51,000 units were sold eight years later.

He is a proponent of \\"radically sustainable living\\". He has been a critic of the profession of architecture for its adherence to conventional theory and practice, and he advocates the reuse of unconventional building materials from waste streams, such as automobile tires, and is known for designs that test the limits of building codes. Career Michael Reynolds (1975) After graduating from the University of Cincinnati in 1969, Reynolds immediately began producing his provocative work. His thesis was published in Architectural Record in 1971 and the following year he built his first house from recycled materials. The structures built under his direction utilize everyday trash items like aluminum beverage cans, plastic bottles and used tires. Instead of using conventional, energy- consuming, recycling methods, however, Reynolds takes the discarded items and recycles them as-is. His Thumb House, built in 1972, used beer cans wired together into \\"bricks\\", which were mortared together and then plastered over. The brick design was patented in 1973.; design patent at USPTO Reynolds calls this practice \\"Earthship Biotecture\\". He cites as an epiphany the moment he realized that any object could be utilized‚Äîan old tire could become a powerful and durable thermal mass when it was filled with soil, or a pop bottle could be used for insulation. He has written five books on the subject. Soon he was building and selling his experimental homes while continuing to use trial-and- error to improve them. Over time, the earthships incorporated features designed to make them comfortable to inhabit while existing off-the-grid. Solar panels and geothermal cooling were added. The unusual homes caught the attention of celebrities and environmental activists. Actors Dennis Weaver and Keith Carradine each commissioned Reynolds to build high-end Earthships for them. Though Reynolds always stressed the experimental nature of his homes, disillusioned buyers filed lawsuits and complaints over defects, such as leaky roofs and inadequate climate control. Spurred by the many claims against Reynolds, the State Architects Board of New Mexico stripped him of his credentials, saying his home designs were illegal and unsafe. In 1990, Reynolds gave up his New Mexico architecture and construction licenses after a year-long dispute with several clients.\\"Controversy Over Green Hero,\\" Architectural Record, June 2000, p. 36. With the rise in concern over global warming, Reynolds has been elevated as a prophet of the green movement. A 2007 documentary, Garbage Warrior, glorifies his life and work. In the film, Reynolds is quoted as saying he fell into depression after his licensing troubles. Faced with the end of his career, Reynolds agreed to follow state and federal codes, though not without protest.In Garbage Warrior, he holds up a four-inch binder thick with paper while referring to the \\"endless horseshit\\" the state puts him through Relationships with his former clients whose earthships failed were never repaired, though the state's intervention left some satisfied that at least others would not be affected in the same ways they had. Reynolds' architect's license was reinstated in 2007 after a 17-year battle, and he resumed building earthships. Since then, the American Institute of Architects has asked Reynolds to give a lecture at its headquarters in Colorado. In Garbage Warrior, Reynolds describes one of his new homes, called the Phoenix: \\"There's nothing coming into this house, no power lines, no gas lines, no sewage lines coming out, no water lines coming in, no energy being used ... We're sitting on 6,000 gallons of water, growing food, sewage internalized, 70 degrees [21¬∞ C] year-round ... What these kind of houses are doing is taking every aspect of your life and putting it into your own hands ... A family of four could totally survive here without having to go to the store.\\" Reynolds features in episode 5 of the 2008 documentary Stephen Fry in America. Reynolds gives Fry a guided tour of his house, describing the various features and their functions. Reynolds explains how his buildings can operate off the electrical grid, requiring little or no mortgage payment and no utility bills.

At the 2016 census, it had a combined urban and rural population of 24,272. Map of Carlow The River Barrow flows through the town, and forms the historic boundary between counties Laois and Carlow. However, the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 included the town entirely in County Carlow. The settlement of Carlow is thousands of years old and pre-dates written Irish history. The town has played a major role in Irish history, serving as the capital of the country in the 14th century. Etymology The name is an anglicisation of the Irish Ceatharlach. Historically, it was anglicised as Caherlagh, Caterlagh and Catherlagh, which are closer to the Irish spelling. According to logainm.ie, the first part of the name derives from the Old Irish word cethrae (\\"animals, cattle, herds, flocks\\"), which is related to ceathar (\\"four\\") and therefore signified \\"four-legged\\". The second part of the name is the ending -lach. Some believe that the name should be Ceatharloch (meaning \\"quadruple lake\\"), since ceathar means \\"four\\" and loch means \\"lake\\". It is directly translated as \\"Four lakes\\", although, there is seemingly no evidence to suggest that these lakes ever existed in this area. History Evidence shows that human occupation in the Carlow county area extends back thousands of years. The most notable and dramatic prehistoric site is the Browneshill Dolmen ‚Äì a megalithic portal tomb just outside Carlow town. Now part of the diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, several Early Christian settlements are still in evidence today around the county. St Mullin's monastery is believed to have been established around the 7th century, the ruins of which are still in evidence today. Old Leighlin was the site of one of the largest monastic settlements in Ireland and the location for a church synod in 630 AD which determined the date of Easter. St Comhgall built a monastery in the Carlow area in the 6th century, an old church building and burial ground survive today at Castle Hill known as Mary's Abbey. Carlow was an Irish stronghold for agriculture in the early 1800s which earned the county the nickname of the scallion eaters. Famine later wiped out half of the population. Carlow Castle was constructed by William Marshal, Earl of Striguil and Lord of Leinster, c1207-13, to guard the vital river crossing. It was also to serve as the capital of the Lordship of Ireland from 1361 until 1374. This imposing structure survived largely intact until 1814 when it was mostly destroyed in an attempt to turn the building into a lunatic asylum. The present remains now are the West Wall with two of its cylindrical towers. The bridge over the river Barrow ‚Äì Graiguecullen Bridge, is agreed to date to 1569. The original structure was largely replaced and widened in 1815 when it was named Wellington Bridge in celebration of the defeat of Napoleon's army by the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo in June of that year. The bridge was built across a small island in the river and a 19th-century house was constructed on the bridge ‚Äì this was for a time occupied by the Poor Clares, an enclosed religious order who still have a convent in Graiguecullen. Another convent belonging to the Presentation Order of nuns now houses the County Library and the Carlow County Museum. The Cathedral, designed by Thomas Cobden, was the first Catholic cathedral to be built in Ireland after Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Its construction cost ¬£9,000 and was completed in 1833. Beside the cathedral, Saint Patrick's College dates from 1793. The College was established in 1782 to teach the humanities to both lay students and those studying for the priesthood. The Carlow Courthouse was constructed in the 19th century. There are still many old estates and houses in the surrounding areas, among them Ducketts Grove and Dunleckney Manor. St Mullin's today houses a heritage centre. In 1703 the Irish House of Commons appointed a committee to bring in a bill to make the Barrow navigable; by 1800 the Barrow Track was completed between St. Mullin's and Athy, establishing a link to the Grand Canal which runs between Dublin and the Shannon. By 1845 88,000 tons of goods were being transported on the Barrow Navigation. Carlow was also one of the earliest towns to be connected by train. The Great Southern and Western Railway had opened its main line as far as Carlow in 1846, and this was extended further to Cork in 1849. The chief engineer, William Dargan, originally hailed from Killeshin, just outside Carlow. At the peak of rail transport in Ireland, Carlow county was also served by a line to Tullow. Public supply of electricity in Carlow was first provided from Milford Mills, approximately 8 km south of Carlow, in 1891. Milford Mills still generates electricity feeding into the national grid. Following independence in the early 1920s the new government of the Irish Free State decided to establish a sugar-processing plant in Leinster. Carlow was chosen as the location due to its transport links and large agricultural hinterland, favourable for growing sugar beet. The town is recalled in the famous Irish folk song, Follow Me Up to Carlow, written in the 19th century about the Battle of Glenmalure, part of the Desmond Rebellions of the late 16th century. In 1650, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Carlow was besieged and taken by English Parliamentarian forces, hastening the end of the Siege of Waterford and the capitulation of that city. During the 1798 rebellion Carlow was the scene of a massacre of 600 rebels and civilians following an unsuccessful attack on the town by the United Irishmen, known as the Battle of Carlow. The Liberty Tree sculpture in Carlow, designed by John Behan, commemorates the events of 1798. The rebels slain in Carlow town are buried in the 'Croppies Grave', in '98 Street, Graiguecullen. Irish language Down to the early 19th century Irish was spoken in all twelve counties of the province of Leinster, of which County Carlow is part. According to Celtic scholar Nicholas Williams, the Irish spoken in County Carlow seems to have belonged to a central dialect stretching from west Connacht eastwards to the Liffey estuary. It had characteristics which survive today only in the Irish of Connacht. It preserved the stress pattern of Old Irish in which the first syllable of a word receives strong stress. Evidence from place-names suggest that Old Irish cn- had become \\"cr-\\" in parts of Carlow, like all Gaelic speech outside of Munster and Ossory. An example from Carlow is Crukeen ().Williams, Nicholas. ‚ÄúNa Can√∫int√≠ a Theacht chun Solais‚Äù in Stair na Gaeilge, ed. Kim McCone et al.. Maigh Nuad 1994, pp. 467-478. . West Carlow seems to have pronounced \\"slender R\\" as \\"slender Z\\" (like the \\"s\\" in \\"treasure\\" or \\"pleasure\\") which is also a well-attested feature of the (now extinct) traditional dialects of Kilkenny and South Laois. Efforts are now being made to increase the use of Irish in Carlow under the aegis of the organisation Gl√≥r Cheatharlach. Carlow has two schools which teach through Irish: a Gaelscoil (primary) and a Gaelchol√°iste (secondary), both at full capacity and supplemented by an Irish-speaking pre-school or Na√≠onra. There is also an intensive Irish-language summer course for students from English-speaking schools. It has been claimed that there is more Irish spoken in Carlow than in certain Gaeltacht districts. Media The Nationalist is a newspaper which was established in 1883. The Carlow People is a free weekly newspaper Places of interest One of Carlow's most notable landmarks is the Brownshill Dolmen, situated on the Hacketstown Road (R726) approximately 5 km from Carlow town centre. The capstone of this dolmen is reputed to be the largest in Europe. Brownshill Dolmen West side of Carlow Castle Carlow Castle was probably built between 1207 and 1213 by William Marshall on the site of a motte erected by Hugh de Lacy in the 1180s. Only the western wall and two towers now survive. It is located on the banks of the River Barrow near Carlow town centre. The castle is now the centrepiece of an urban renewal programme. Carlow Courthouse is situated at the end of Dublin Street. It was designed by William Vitruvius Morrison in 1830 and completed in 1834. It is built of Carlow granite and gives the impression of being a temple set on a high plinth. The basement contains cells and dungeons. A cannon from the Crimean War stands on the steps. Town hall Carlow Town Hall is situated on the north side of the Haymarket, and was the trading centre for Carlow. A number of other markets were located around the town, including the Potato Market and Butter Market. The Town Hall was designed by the church architect William Hague in 1884. Milford is a green area on the River Barrow approx 5 miles outside of Carlow town. It is notable as its home to Milford Mill, which was the first inland hydro-electrical plant in Ireland. It began supplying Carlow town with power in 1891. The estate at Oak Park is located north of Carlow. Economy Carlow industry has come a long way since the early 20th century, when the town became the centre of Ireland's slow process of industrialisation with the creation of the Irish Sugar Company. Then at the cutting edge of industry in Ireland, the sugar factory opened in 1926 as a private enterprise and was eventually nationalised before reverting to private ownership. It closed on 11 March 2005 as the management of the parent company Greencore decided that it was no longer economical to run the factory nor was it viable to upgrade the facility. The country's last remaining sugar plant at Mallow, County Cork closed in 2006. One of the traditional, principal employers in Carlow was OralB Braun, which had a large factory producing mostly hair dryers and electric toothbrushes; however this closed in 2010. Burnside is also a large employer in the area; it produces hydraulic cylinders. The Institute of Technology is also a significant employer in the town. Since opening its doors in October 2003 Fairgreen Shopping Centre has also played a large part in employment in the area; Tesco, Heatons, Next, New Look and River Island are the main tenants. Nonetheless, the town shares problems associated with other provincial towns in Ireland ‚Äì the inability to attract significant new industry. Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. intends to build a new vaccine manufacturing plant in Carlow. Transport The N9 road from Dublin to Waterford passed directly through the town until May 2008 when a bypass, part of the M9 motorway, was opened, greatly reducing traffic through the town. The N80 National secondary road skirts the edge of the town. The town is also connected to the national rail network. These transport links have helped Carlow to become a successful satellite town of Dublin in recent years. The establishment of the Institute of Technology, Carlow, has also helped drive growth in the area and encouraged many school leavers to remain in the town. Carlow railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and was closed for goods traffic on 9 June 1976, it remains open for public travel. Education Secondary schools serving the area include Gaelchol√°iste Cheatharlach, Presentation College, Tyndall College (including the former Carlow Vocational School), Tullow Community School, St Leo's College, and St Mary's Knockbeg College. Third-level institutions include the Institute of Technology, Carlow, Carlow Institute of Further Education, and St. Patrick's, Carlow College. The latter, opened in 1793, was the first post-penal Catholic seminary constructed in Ireland. It is built in the form of a large country house and claims to be the seminary in longest continuous use worldwide.J. Garaty, The Carlow Connection: The contribution of Irish seminarians in 19th century Australia, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 35 (2014) , 10-21. Religion Nave of Carlow Cathedral Carlow Cathedral dedicated to Our Lady of Assumption, was started in 1828 and completed in 1833, in Gothic style. The main architect was Thomas Cobden, but the cathedral was the brain-child of the Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, James Doyle (J.K.L.), a prominent champion of Catholic Emancipation, who died the year after the cathedral was opened and is interred in its walls. A sculpture by John Hogan is a memorial to the bishop and was finished in 1839. An unidentified baby was left here on 22 January 2010.RT√â. \\"Baby left in Carlow Cathedral\\".

St. Mary's Church of Ireland dates from 1727, though the tower and spire, built to a height of 59 m (195 ft) were added in 1834. The interior retains its traditional galleries and there are several monuments, including some by neo-classical architect, Sir Richard Morrison. Sport =Motor racing= On 2 July 1903, the Gordon Bennett Cup ran through Carlow. It was the first international motor race to be held in Great Britain or Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the British Isles, Ireland was suggested as the venue because racing was illegal on British public roads. After some lobbying and changes to local laws, Kildare was chosen, partly because the straightness of its roads would be a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green. The route consisted of several laps of a circuit passed-through Kilcullen, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally, Athy, Castledermot and Carlow. The race was won by the Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes. =Racquetball= The Carlow Racquetball club was set up in 1978. The club is one of only 7 in the south eastern region and is the largest of these. =Clubs= GAA clubs in the area include Tinryland GAA Club, √âire √ìg GAA Club, Asca GAA Club, Palatine GAA club, and O'Hanrahans GAA Club. County Carlow Football Club is the local rugby union club, while F.C. Carlow is a local association football (soccer) club. Carlow also has boxing clubs, an athletics club (St Laurence O'Toole Athletics Club), golf club, rowing club, tennis club, hockey club and the Carlow Jaguar Scooter Club. (Founded in 1979, this latter club is one of the longest running scooter clubs in Ireland or England).

These technologies flourished at that time because of the poor quality of the early Phonograph (Gramophone in Britain).Daily Telegraph, Gerald Stonehill Obituary 8 Mar 11 Between 1913 and 1925 a number of distinguished classical and popular pianists, such as Ignace Paderewski, Josef Hofmann, Percy Grainger, Teresa Carre√±o, Aurelio Giorni, Robert Armbruster and Vladimir Horowitz, recorded for Duo-Art, and their rolls are a legacy of 19th-century and early 20th-century aesthetic and musical practice. The recording process ‚Äì using a piano wired to a perforating machine ‚Äì was unable to capture the pianist's dynamics automatically. These were added by a recording technician, who manipulated hand controls to notate the dynamics onto the recording 'master'. Thus, post- recording editing was required to produce the finished performance ‚Äì usually a joint effort by the recording technician and the pianist themself, who approved the final product. Thus, these recordings do represent the overall style of these great artists and are a good representation of their live performances. The Aeolian Company introduced the Duo-Art mechanism in 1913. It was most commonly installed in piano brands manufactured by Aeolian such as Weber, Steck, Wheelock, and Stroud. Most notably, it was also available in Steinway pianos under an exclusive agreement. Aeolian had been under pressure to make the mechanism available in Steinway pianos, but Steinway had no interest in pursuing a relationship with a company they saw as a competitor. To appease Steinway, Aeolian agreed to stop promoting its Weber brand as a premium brand, and stop sponsoring concerts by Paderewski and other pianists. The agreement also stipulated that Aeolian purchase a certain number of Steinway units each year, regardless of whether or not they could sell them. This contract eventually became a huge financial burden after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In 1925, its peak year, Aeolian produced more than 190,000 instruments, but the crash, the electric phonograph and the \\"talkies\\" all combined to drive the business into a terminal decline.

Coote was the third son of the 3rd Earl of Mountrath (1655‚Äì1709). He was educated at St Paul's School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1706. Coote was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Jamestown in 1715. His elder brothers Charles and Henry both succeeded to the earldom before him but died unmarried. Coote succeeded in his turn on 27 March 1720 and ascended to the Irish House of Lords. Mountrath was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1723. As his earldom was also Irish, it did not disqualify him from sitting in the British House of Commons, and he entered Parliament in the same year as member for Castle Rising in Norfolk, which he represented for ten years. He also became Governor of Queen's County. In 1741 he stood for Parliament again at Hedon in Yorkshire, and was initially declared defeated. However, on petition to the House of Commons (in those days the normal procedure in a disputed election), the result was overturned and on 4 March 1742 Mountrath was declared elected after all. He sat as member for the borough for the remaining two years of his life. In 1721 he married Lady Diana Newport (d. 1766), daughter of the 2nd Earl of Bradford. Horace Walpole described her as being \\"as rich and as tipsy as Cacofogo in the comedy. What a jumble of avarice, lewdness, dignity - and claret!\\". They had only one child, Charles (c. 1725‚Äì1802), who succeeded to the earldom on Mountrath's death in 1744, but who died unmarried, the title thereby becoming extinct.

He played as a forward in a career spanning seventeen years from 1969 to 1986. He played for clubs in Northern Ireland, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. He also played for Northern Ireland. Club career Spence started his career with Irish League club Crusaders in 1969, before making the short trip to England in 1971 to join Fourth Division side Oldham Athletic, signing his contract in a local pub to earn ¬£18 a week. He spent three years in the Oldham reserves at Boundary Park. He went on to make just six league appearances for the Latics, before joining Bury in 1972. It was at Gigg Lane that he spent the majority of his thirteen- year career and scored the most league goals ‚Äì 44 in 140 league games. Spence posing with Ally McCoist's Golden Boot inside Rangers' trophy room at Ibrox Stadium in 1994 In 1976, Spence joined Second Division side Blackpool, and made his debut for the Seasiders against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest on 16 October. He complemented the twin striking powers of Mickey Walsh and fellow new signing Bob Hatton. However, at the end of the season he found his place under threat from Stan McEwan. A serious injury kept Spence out of the entire 1977‚Äì78 campaign, which ended with Blackpool's relegation to the Third Division for the first time in their history. Spence then joined Greek Alpha Ethniki club Olympiacos, where he made 21 league appearances, scoring six goals. He then returned to Blackpool, who were then playing in the Third Division, for a fee of ¬£27,000 and joined forces with Tony Kellow, who had signed from Exeter City. Between them, they scored 27 goals in the 1978‚Äì79 season, nearly half of the team's total, with Spence top scorer on sixteen goals. Speaking about his return to Lancashire, he said \\"I made quite a lot of money from my time in Greece, but being there put me in the international wilderness. From being a regular in the squad, I became an outcast. So, despite the crowd being fantastic and the players who loved me, I moved back to England.\\" He nearly did not rejoin, however. \\"I had basically agreed terms with Arthur Cox at Chesterfield when Bob Stokoe rang me. He invited me back to Blackpool and, to be honest, I jumped at the chance. Needless to say, Arthur wasn't too happy.\\" On 26 December 1979, in a game against Hull City at Bloomfield Road, Spence suffered an injury serious enough that it eventually forced his premature retirement from the game. In 1980, he moved to Fourth Division side Southend United, helping them to win promotion in the 1980‚Äì81 season as champions. He scored 32 goals in 104 games over a two-year period. Between 1982 and 1986, Spence spent spells with Dutch club Sparta Rotterdam and Hong Kong clubs Sea Bee and Hong Kong Rangers (playing alongside international teammate George Best) before finishing his professional career with a second spell at Bury in 1986. He retired in 1986 at the age of 34 and eventually retired in Non-League football with Oldham Town in the North West Counties Football League. International career Spence won his first Northern Ireland cap on 16 March 1975, in a single-goal victory over Yugoslavia in Belfast. He went on to win 29 caps in total, scoring three goals. His most notable appearance occurred on 13 October 1976, when he came on as a late substitute and scored a late equaliser against the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifying game in Rotterdam. He ended his international career after discovering, via Teletext, that Billy Bingham had left him out of the 1982 World Cup squad.Blackpool: A Complete Record: 1887‚Äì1992, Breedon Books, Roy Calley (1992) Post-football career Spence, posing with his Sportslink car in 1994.

It was the world's first top spin ride to feature a drown-upside-down element. History and Operation Entrance to the ride in 2010, with Forbidden Kingdom theming. Rameses Revenge was manufactured by Huss Rides, a German company who had previously made Chessington's Black Buccaneer ride. It was one of the first top spin flat rides built to feature water fountains, which spray riders at certain points in the ride cycle. Introduced in 1995, Rameses Revenge was the main focus of advertising for Chessington World of Adventures Resort in that year, and was also widely featured in the British media, even being featured in its own segment by the ITV Evening News. It is situated in the Egyptian themed Forbidden Kingdom area of the park. Rameses Revenge was refurbished in 2007, with new settings placed onto the ride's PLC to improve ride-ability. The ride is surrounded by buildings resembling a traditional Arabic market town, while the ride itself is built into a pit. The ride was re-branded with a new colour scheme and logo in 2000. The ride entrance was relocated in 2015 and the queue was shortened. =Removal= Rameses Revenge closed to the public on 3 November 2019 and was removed from Chessington on 31 December that same year, with a crocodile-themed drop tower ride (being named Croc Drop) being its proposed replacement. This means that there are no more permanent HUSS Top Spins in the UK, just travelling ones.Chessington: New ride replacing Rameses Revenge - RideRater. 9 September 2019. Retrieved 9 September 2019. Legacy Rameses Revenge is one of the most successful and nationally recognised rides to have opened in Britain. Its expansive marketing campaign gained the ride the title as one of the most revolutionary flat rides of its time. The ride is responsible for the most attended year in Chessington's history, with over 2.2 million guests reportedly visiting in 1995. Incidents *On 23 July 2011 40 guests were trapped upside down when the ride stopped due to a technical issue, after a few seconds, the safety system activated, lowering riders to ground level. It then took a further 20 minutes to release them. 6 people were treated by emergency services for asthma and panic attacks. Subsequently, the ride was closed for the rest of the year.

It featured the first dot matrix display (DMD) ever incorporated into a pinball game. For Checkpoint, Data East used a \\"half-height\\" DMD. By way of comparison, Williams later produced machines with standard DMDs that were twice the height. Checkpoint also features video mode minigames on its display. In 2008, the Popular Mechanics website included the machine on a list of the top eight most innovative pinball machines of all time.Porges, Seth, Top 8 Most Innovative Pinball Machines of All Time, 5 August 2008, Popular Mechanics website. Retrieved 22 May 2014. Gameplay The machine's gameplay centers on a ramp with a so-called Lasermatic speed detection feature that \\"clock\\" a pinball's speed by measuring the time between the ball hitting one switch and then a second, translating that time into a speed analogous to that of a racing car. The minimum is 80 MPH; a skilled player can achieve a speed upwards of 250 MPH. In addition to the customary high score list, Checkpoint also let players record their initials if they set the machine's speed record. A similar speed measuring feature already appeared in the pinball machine Vector from Bally in 1981. Various scoring objectives can be met by achieving certain shot speeds. The game has four single-ball modes Fast, Blue Light Special, 1 million ramp/10 million ramp and Hot Nitro Round. The game also features multiball modes putting two or even three balls in play simultaneously. Checkpoint was also the first game to provide players with a choice of music before setting the first ball in motion. A player can select from among several musical styles, including Country, Rock, Jazz, Rap, Classical and Soul. One of few other example of a multiple choice music feature is Sega's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The novelty quickly wore off for many players, who just wanted to play the game without having to repeatedly go through the choice of the style before the start of each game. The game features an ignition key to start the game, an auto plunger, a shaker motor that let the table rumble like a racing car and a Porsche Carrera theme with a spinning wheel in the backbox and an image of Neuschwanstein Castle in the background of the backglass. Checkpoint is one of the few pinball machines designed by DataEast that was not exclusively linked to a film or television show in this period. Impact of DMDs on pinball Demolition Man Before the DMDs, pinball machines displayed their scores on spinning reels and, later on simple digital displays. Dot matrix displays enabled designers to provide players with more gameplay information. Graphics and animations in the back-box showed players such data as their progress during the game, the mode in which they were currently playing, and available bonuses. Home Leisure Direct's Andy Beresford, an UK‚Äôs game room specialist, wrote that the introduction of DMDs propelled pinball into its golden age, asserting that the games released in the 1990s were among the best ever made. He supported this claim with rating statistics from Pinside Pinball and the International Pinball database. According to Beresford, after the video game boom and crash the interest in pinball games revived. Pinball table designers, he said, were now able to tell an actual story that gave pinball machines a more lively feel and personality. In his view, the combination of physical ball movement on a well designed playfield with the new effects took pinball to a whole new level. DMDs on pinball machines are plasma displays, not LEDs that would be much dimmer. They consists of an individually addressable dot grid rectangular array, capable of displaying text and graphics by energizing selected dots. These displays usually use Neon gas, which glows orange when ionized by a high voltage electric current pass through the segment.http://www.ipdb.org/glossary.php#Dot_Matrix_Display A DMD on a pinball machine is usually 128 pixels wide and 32 pixels high (Checkpoint used only 16 pixels high). Designers achieved, according to Beresford, amazing effects over the years despite such limitations. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like Gottlieb's Caveman and Bally's Baby Pac-Man in 1982 and Bally's Granny and the Gators in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine Dakar from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Williams' Pinball 2000 Games Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Revenge from Mars (1999) that utilize a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor display onto a specially-designed semi-transparent glass inside the head of the machine and above the playfield. MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original Canasta titled New Canasta, with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010. The first LCDs in the back box of US pinball tables were released with The Wizard of Oz in 2013. Custom pinball modifications include the use of ColorDMD to replace the standard mono color DMDs. In 2015, the new British pinball manufacturer Heighway Pinball released the racing themed pinball machine Full Throttle. The game has its LCD screen for scores, info & animations located in the playfield surface at player‚Äôs eye view.

At the beginning of the 1940s he moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he studied with Liddy Mignone at the Conservatorio Brasileiro de Musica, where he himself began to teach in the 1950s. At the age of thirteen he temporarily left classical music and set up a jazz trio with his friends Dinarte Rodrigues (on guitar) and Breno Porto (on drums). The trio began to perform once a week on Radio Jornal do Brasil, starting in 1946. In 1948 Klein returned to classical music and studied with William Kapell in New York City and with Bruno Seidlhofer in Vienna. In 1953 he won first prize at the Geneva International Music Competition, which launched his international career. In 1954 Klein appeared with the London Philharmonic. In 1955 he was chosen as the best pianist of the year in London and received the Harriet Cohen Medal. He formed a duo with violinist Salvatore Accardo and performed with pianist Friedrich Gulda. He taught at the school of music at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and at the University of Miami. He made a number of recordings of the Brazilian samba.

Wool insulation is made from sheep wool fibres that are either mechanically held together or bonded using between 5% and 20% recycled polyester adhesive to form insulating batts, rolls and ropes. Natural wool insulation is effective for both thermal and acoustic insulation. The wool is often sourced from the less expensive black wools of the UK and Europe. Batts are commonly used in the walls and ceilings of timber-frame buildings, rolls can be cut to size for lofts, and ropes can be used between the logs in log homes. Natural wool insulation should be distinguished from mineral wool insulation, also called slag wool or rock wool, which only resembles natural wool fibers. It is actually made from rock, blast furnace slag, and other raw materials which are melted and spun into fibers. Sheep wool is a natural, sustainable, recyclable material, which is biodegradable, and has low embodied energy. It does not endanger the health of people or the environment, and does not require protection to install, unlike fiberglass insulation. Wool is a highly effective insulating material which performs better than its rated R value because it can absorb and release moisture. Mongolian nomads used felted and woven sheep wool pads as an insulating layer on the walls and floors of their dwellings, called ger or yurts. The use of wool for insulation is starting to rise in popularity. It is already popular in Australia, which produces 55% of the world's raw and processed wool, as well as in Europe and Canada, and is gaining ground in the United States  Building considerations  Wool insulation commonly comes in rolls of batts or ropes with varied widths and thicknesses depending on the manufacturer. Generally, wool batts have thicknesses of 50 mm (2 in) to 100mm (4 in), with widths of 400 mm (16 in) and 600 mm (24 in), and lengths of 4000 mm (13 ft 4 in), 5000 mm (16 ft 8 in), 6000 mm (20 ft) and 7200 mm (24 ft). The widths of 16 in and 24 in are the standard measurements between studs in a stud frame wall. Most manufacturers provide custom sizes as well and batts and ropes are easy to cut once on site. Wool insulation costs significantly more than conventional fiberglass insulation, but does not require the use of protective gloves, and may have significantly lower health risks to both the building occupants and the installation crew. It can be used in the roof, walls and floors of any building type as long as there are spaces to put the insulation in. Installing wool insulation is very similar to installing conventional insulation batts; it can be held into place with staples or it can be friction-fit, which involves cutting the insulation slightly bigger than the space it occupies, using friction to hold it in place.  Environmental considerations  Some wool used to manufacture insulation is the wool discarded as waste by other industries due to its colour or grade. As a controlled waste product it cannot be disposed of until it is cleaned. Hence the energy footprint of washing the wool is attributed to the livestock industry under PAS2050. There are some primary environmental factors that need to be considered when looking for a source of wool, such as the way the flock is treated for pesticides, the chemicals used in the treatment of the wool after shearing, and the distance from the source to its final destination. Sheep are often treated with insecticide and fungicide in a process called dipping. This leaves a residue on the fleece and can result in groundwater contamination if used improperly.Cypermethrin sheep dip to be scrapped. environment-agency.gov.uk. 3 March 2010 These residues are often washed off once the fleece is sheared, but this results in three byproducts: grease, liquor, and sludge. The first two can be safely disposed of, but the third contains remnants of the pesticides which cause a concern for disposal. Sheep wool insulation is often treated with borax to enhance its fire retardant and pest repellent qualities. The level of Borax is relatively low only 4% dry weight although the scouring baths have a higher load of 8‚Äì9%.Mike Madon ‚Äì British Wool Textiles research undertaken 2007 Borax mining employs one of the cleanest mining techniques availableTom Laichas, A Conversation with Jared Diamond. worldhistoryconnected.press.uiuc.edu but borax is increasingly coming into focus as a suspected reproductive toxin having been considered relatively safe for many years; animal ingestion studies in several species, at high doses, indicate that borates cause reproductive and developmental effects. The most significant exposure route for humans is inhalation which raises questions over whether dust from wool insulation could lead to a significant exposure to humans, though this is probably unlikely for anyone except professional installers. There are some companies that use DE (Diatomaceous Earth) as pesticide. DE is believed to be harmless and is used in feed and animals to stave off parasites. DE has the drawback of having to be applied in two steps to be effective and the wool having to be installed loose.http://proearthbuilders.com/Wool_Insulation.html Some companies use Thorlan IW (Kaliumfluorotitanat), which repels moths. It is a titanium based treatment which remains with the fiber during its entire period of use. Thorlan IW is in the European Union chemical law register of certified products. A rubber solution is applied hot and allows a coating of Thorlan to stay with the product for its lifetime.

Evans, Ianto, Linda Smiley, and Michael Smith. The hand-sculpted house: a philosophical and practical guide to building a cob cottage. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co., 2002. 264. Print.) is a blend of clay, fine aggregate, and fiber. Other common additives include pigments, lime, casein, prickly pear cactus juice (Opuntia), manure, and linseed oil. Earthen plaster is usually applied to masonry, cob, or straw bale interiors or exteriors as a wall finish. It provides protection to the structural and insulating building components as well as texture and color. Physical composition All plasters and stuccos have several common features: they all contain a structural component, a binding element, and some form of fiber. Usually the term plaster refers to a wall covering made from earth, lime or gypsum, while stucco uses a cement or synthetic binding element. =Clay: the binding agent= Clay is a soil component consisting of extremely fine particles. Most clays consist of hydrous aluminum silicates, though there is a considerable amount of chemical variation among the clays. Clay is cohesive and binds to the sand and the straw, holding the mixture together, as well as securing the mixture to the wall. Clay is also plastic when wet, which makes the plaster mixture workable. =Sand: structural strength= Sand provides structure, strength, and bulk to earthen plasters. Sand consists of tiny mineral granules of rock, its parent material. Predominately composed of silicon dioxide (quartz), sand is a non-reactive substance. Because sand occurs naturally in many subsoils, all of the sand necessary may be already found in the soil. =Fiber: tensile strength and reinforcement= Dry straw, hemp fiber, cattails, coconut fiber, and animal hair are all suitable fiber choices for earthen plasters. Fiber forms a reinforcing meshwork in plasters, which helps to hold the plaster together. Fiber also provides some flexibility to a dried plaster. When clay dries it shrinks and tends to crack, but this cracking can be countered by the fiber. The fiber used in plasters must be clean, dry, and mold-free. Additives Additives are usually blended with the clay, sand, and natural fiber to improve the workability and strength of a plaster. Sometimes additives are added to the finish coat and other times additives may be added to all coats. Some of the most common additives are wheat flour paste, manure, cactus juice, casein (milk protein) and various natural oils such as linseed oil. Other additives include, salt, stearate, tallow, tannin, leaves and bark of certain trees, xanthan gum, alum, natural glues, gum arabic, kelp, lime, powdered milk, or the blood of livestock. =Flour paste= Cooked flour paste is a cheap natural glue that is easy to make from common ingredients. The water and flour slurry is cooked until the gluten binds the elements of the mixture, creating a durable glue. In plaster, the flour paste serves as a binding agent and a hardener. =Manure= Manure serves as a binding agent and gives plaster more body. Manure also contains small natural fibers that provide additional tensile strength as well as reduce cracking and water erosion. Different types of manure have different effects. Horse manure has a high microfiber content, but cow manure has more hardening enzymes. People have reported success with llama and alpaca dung. Manure should be fresh or fermented when mixed with plaster, as composted manure loses its enzymes and adhesive qualities. Manure should be sifted before use. =Prickly pear cactus juice= The liquid from prickly pear cactus used to be one of the most common additives in the Americas. The juice from the prickly pear cactus leaf pads will serve many functions. According to some sources, it helps the plaster set and increases its stickiness or adhesion. Cactus juice also serves as a stabilizer in that it helps make earthen plasters more water-resistant and more durable. It also prevents dusting. Cactus juice can increase plaster's workability and its ability to be formed into the desired shape. Workability depends on the water content, the shape and size distribution of its aggregate (such as rock, sand, natural fiber, etc.), the age of the plaster, and the amount of other natural binder(s) (such as lime, wheatpaste, cactus juice, hardening vegetable oil, casein and other proteins, etc.) Altering the water content, changing the aggregate mix, soaking the clay, or changing the binders will increase or decrease the plaster's workability. Excessive water will lead to increased bleeding (surface water) and/or segregation of aggregates (when the natural binder and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting plaster having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low workability, which cannot be readily made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water or binder. Cactus juice works well because it contains pectin, a water-soluble long-chain carbohydrate that acts as the binding agent to increase the adhesion of an earthen plaster. Pectin is also responsible for increasing the water resistance of an earthen plaster and has been used to augment lime plasters in both Mexico and the southwestern United States for hundreds of years. Cactus juice is extracted by immersing cut leaves in water for as long as two weeks. Interior earthen plaster Pure earthen plaster (plaster without lime, cement, or emulsified asphalt) is applied to interior surfaces more frequently than exteriors. Before the plaster can be applied, it must have a surface to bind to. Many types of wire mesh may be used, such as expanded-metal lath, woven wire lath, or welded wire lath. Reed mats are another option. If the plaster is being applied to a smooth surface such as drywall or plywood, a mixture of sand and wheat paste may be painted on to the surface to create the texture needed for plaster to bond. The plaster is usually applied in three coats. The first layer of plaster is called a \\"scratch coat\\". A \\"comb\\" is used to scratch the surface horizontally or in a crisscross pattern to provide a key for the second layer. In the United States, the \\"comb\\" is commonly referred to as the \\"scratcher\\". The next layer is called the \\"brown coat\\" or leveling coat. It is leveled with tools called \\"Darbys\\" and \\"Rods\\", scraped smooth, and floated to provide a nice even surface onto which to apply the color coat. It is then allowed to dry (cure) for 7‚Äì10 days minimum to allow \\"checking\\" (shrinkage) to take place. The final layer is referred to as the \\"color coat\\" or \\"finishing coat\\", and is typically 3 mm (1/8\\") thick. It usually consists of clay with no fiber and sand added. The color coat material was found in certain areas, red, green, white with mica and other colors, the material was gathered, made into a uniform consistency, water added, applied to the walls in multi layers until the desired surface was acceptable. The process in Spanish was known as, 'alisando'. Advantages and disadvantages of earthen plaster Earthen plasters are less toxic and energy intensive than many other wall coverings, which makes them appealing to the environmentally conscious. Earthen plasters are also easily repaired and inexpensive. They resist water penetration but are permeable to water vapor. However, earthen plasters are often more labor- intensive than other forms of wall covering. If the mix does not have the correct component proportions, then many other problems may occur, such as dusting and cracking. Earthen plasters are not approved by all local building codes, and some require the use of cement stabilizers or asphalt emulsion. Earthen plaster is a rare wall covering in the developed world and there is a dearth of local experts for construction and repair.

The architectural design of the Red House is of Beaux-Arts style. The original building was destroyed in the 1903 water riots and was rebuilt in 1907. The Red House is located centrally within the capital city Port of Spain. It is currently used as a meeting place for parliament and elections and for political uses. In July 1990, the Red House was the site of the Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt, during which the Prime Minister and other members of the government were held hostage for six days and 24 people were killed. \\"The First Red\\" On 15 February 1844, then Governor of Trinidad, Sir Henry McLeod, laid the foundation stone for a new government administration building on the western edge of the Woodford Square, then known as Brunswick Square. This building was to be constructed on eight privately owned parcels of land. The then Superintendent of Public Works, Mr. Richard Bridgens designed the building and it was constructed by contractors, Messrs G. de la Sauvagere and A. A. Pierre. The building was to consist of a north and south blocks and connected by a double archway, much as the Red House of today. The double archway was a necessary architectural feature required by the City Council to keep patent Prince Street, as the buildings were constructed over this street. The Council stipulated that Prince Street should never be closed to the public and, pedestrian and wheeled traffic should pass freely. The southern block completed in 1848 contained the courts of law and the northern to colonial administration offices. The buildings were slow to complete and, by 1892, they still were unfinished, as indicated by a quote within the newspaper, the Port- of-Spain Gazette: \\"Nothing further had been done to complete the buildings since their erection some fifty years ago. The only attempt to relieve the monotony of the whole is to be seen in the arching of the carriageway through the courtyard which is a perfect skeleton and, like the ruins of Pompeii, is more suggestive of what the buildings must have been than of what they were intended to be.\\" After many alterations and additions the buildings were completed at a cost of ¬£15,000.  Fire  In 1897, as Trinidad was preparing to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, the buildings were given a coat of red paint, and the public promptly referred to them thereafter as the Red House. This direct ancestor of the present Red House was burnt to the ground on 23 March 1903. On the day of the fire, while the a new ordinance regarding the distribution of and payment for water in the town was being debated in the Legislative Council, a protest meeting was held in Brunswick Square by the Ratepayer's Association, as there was much public dissatisfaction over certain clauses contained in the ordinance which increased the water rates. At the end of the meeting, the crowds became noisy and stones were thrown, and all the windows of the original Red House were smashed including a stained glass window in the chamber which was erected to commemorate the arrival of Christopher Columbus in Trinidad. When a woman was arrested by a policeman, the mob became riotous. Stones were thrown into the Council Chamber and the Members were forced to protect themselves under tables and desks and behind the pillars. Still, the Governor, Sir Cornelius Alfred Moloney, refused to withdraw the Ordinance. When it became known that the lower storey of the building was on fire, the riot act was read, following which the police opened fire on the crowd. Sixteen people were killed and forty-two injured, and the Red House was completely gutted. After the fire, only the shell of the original Red House remained.  Rebuilding  The work of rebuilding it began the following year, and the Red House, as it is known today, was erected on the same site. It was opened to the public on 4 February 1907 by Governor Sir Henry Moore Jackson. The building was designed and built by D. M. Hahn, Chief Draughtsman of the Public Works, at an estimated cost of ¬£7,485. This sum included the gesso work (a mixture of plaster of Paris and glue) in the Legislative Council Chamber and the Justice Hall, which was estimated at ¬£7,200. The work was completed in 1906. The ceiling is the most striking feature in the Chamber. It is Wedgwood blue with white gesso work and was the work of Messrs. Jackson & Sons, an English firm. The decorations were made in England in panels, and shipped to Trinidad in crates. An Italian craftsman was sent to install the ceiling. The entablature and dais at the eastern end were also designed by D. M. Hahn. The columns and entablature are made of purpleheart, while the panelling is fustic. The passageway between the two buildings which replaced the double archway, is no longer open to vehicular traffic. The fountain in the centre of the rotunda was designed by D. M. Hahn as a means of cooling and ventilation for the offices, in the days before air-conditioning. The offices of the early Red House, with the exception of the Governor's office and that of the Colonial Secretary, comprised offices for the Attorney-General, Registrar-General Lands & Surveys Department, Judges' Chambers, the Courts of Justice and the Parliament and Law Libraries, as well as the Legislative Council Chamber, which is now the Parliament Chamber. At present, the building is being restored for the exclusive use of the Parliament. The Red House today is the second Government building to be known by this name since the newly constructed government offices were built on the same site and given the same name. The name Brunswick Square was changed to Woodford Square during World War I in 1914-1918. The rubble which was removed after the fire was used as landfill for Victoria and Harris Squares.

The project was conceived by Christoph Harbsmeier, its chief editor, and receives input by a large number of academic contributors worldwide. The content of TLS is preserved and presented in the form of a relational database hosted by the Institute of Chinese Studies, University of Heidelberg. According to the editors, TLS is designed throughout to make the classical Chinese evidence strictly comparable to that of other cultures, and to make possible meaningful analytic primary-evidence-based disagreement among non- sinologists on classical Chinese concepts and words. The editors hope that careful philosophical reflection on Chinese texts might serve to broaden the empirical basis for philosophical theories and generalisations on conceptual schemes. They intend to improve the clarity and bite of declarations of difference between conceptual schemes by enlarging the basis of literally translated and analysed texts from widely (though never radically) different intellectual cultures, and to make precise criteria of translation for classical Chinese, mainly through a detailed description in English of systematic recurrent semantic relations between Chinese words, especially distinctive semantic features. Key features of TLS are: * Focusing on distinctive semantic nuances, it serves as a synonym dictionary of classical Chinese. * It systematically organises the Chinese vocabulary in taxonomic and mereonomic hierarchies, thus showing up whole conceptual schemes or cognitive systems; these are taken to circumscribe the changing topology of Chinese mental space. * It systematically registers a range of lexical relations like antonym, converse, epithet etc.; TLS thus aims to define conceptual space as a relational space. * It incorporates detailed syntactic analysis of (over 600 distinct kinds of) syntactic usage; TLS thus enables users to make a systematic study of such basic phenomena as the natural history of abstract nouns in China. * It is a corpus-based dictionary which will record the history of rhetorical devices in texts and thus enables the study of such things as the natural history of irony in China. * All analytic categories and procedures of analysis in TLS are flexible in the sense that they are continuously being revised and improved in the light of new observation and analysis.

Function  Granins (chromogranins or secretogranins) are acidic proteins and are present in the secretory granules of a wide variety of endocrine and neuro-endocrine cells. The exact function(s) of these proteins is not yet settled but there is evidence that granins function as pro-hormones, giving rise to an array of peptide fragments for which autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine activities have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The intracellular biochemistry of granins includes binding of Ca2+, ATP and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) within the hormone storage vesicle core. There is also evidence that CgA, and perhaps other granins, regulate the biogenesis of dense-core secretory vesicles and hormone sequestration in neuroendocrine cells.  Structure  Apart from their subcellular location and the abundance of acidic residues (Asp and Glu), these proteins do not share many structural similarities. Only one short region, located in the C-terminal section, is conserved in all these proteins. Chromogranins and secretogranins together share a C-terminal motif, whereas chromogranins A and B share a region of high similarity in their N-terminal section; this region includes two cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond. There are considerable differences in the amino acid composition between different animals. Commercial assays for measuring human CGA can usually not be used for measuring CGA in samples from other species. Some specific parts of the molecule have a higher degree of amino acid homology and methods where the antibodies are directed against specific epitopes can be used to measure samples from different animals. Region-specific assays measuring defined parts of CGA, CGB and SG2 can be used for measurements in samples from cats and dogs.

Once a streetcar line, it is now part of the southbound direction of the M10 and M20 bus routes. History The Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad was chartered by the New York State Legislature in April 1860; the authorized system consisted of two main lines - the Seventh Avenue Line and Broadway Line - connecting Broadway near City Hall with Central Park. The Seventh Avenue Line began at Seventh Avenue and 59th Street and proceeded in a general southerly direction through Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Avenue, Eighth Street, MacDougal Street, Fourth Street, Thompson Street, Canal Street, and West Broadway, with a one-way pair of single tracks in West Broadway and Barclay Street in one direction and Chambers Street and Church Street in the other, and ending in a double track on the block of Barclay Street between Church Street and Broadway. Branches along three other streets - Broome Street, Duane Street, and Park Place - to Broadway were also authorized, and the Broadway Line shared the route north of Times Square and south of Barclay Street (in one direction on Church Street) and Canal Street (in the other direction on West Broadway).Chapter 513, An Act to authorize the construction of a railroad in Seventh avenue, and in certain other streets and avenues of the city of New York, passed April 17, 1860, reproduced in A Compilation of the Ferry Leases and Railroad Grants Made by the Corporation of the City of New York, 1860, pages 354 to 359 The company was incorporated on May 26, 1864,Harry James Carman, The Street Surface Railway Franchises of New York City, pages 119 to 121 and opened the Seventh Avenue Line by the end of 1865.New York Times, Our City Railroads, December 26, 1865, page 8 The initial route ran northbound on Church Street and southbound on West Broadway from Barclay Street to Chambers Street, using West Broadway in both directions to Canal Street. Except in Barclay Street, the line used existing tracks already shared between the Sixth Avenue Railroad's Sixth Avenue Line and Eighth Avenue Railroad's Eighth Avenue Line south of the intersection of Canal Street and Thompson Street. An 1866 law required the company to replace its double track in Fourth and Thompson Streets with a one-way pair, the other direction using Third and Sullivan Streets between MacDougal and Canal Streets.Chapter 500, An Act to change the route of the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad Company in the city of New York, reproduced in A Compilation of the Existing Ferry Leases and Railroad Grants Made by the Corporation of the City of New York, 1866, pages 412 to 413 Since the block of MacDougal Street between Third and Fourth Streets was already used northbound by the Bleecker Street and Fulton Ferry Railroad's Bleecker Street Line, and the Seventh Avenue cars used that track via trackage rights, a law was passed in 1867 requiring the Seventh Avenue cars to travel in the same direction, with northbound cars in Sullivan Street, a block west of southbound cars in Thompson Street. The line in Park Place from the one-way pair of West Broadway and Church Street east to Broadway was built later for Seventh Avenue cars, while the Broadway Line continued to use Barclay Street, one block to the south.

The technique uses layered long fabric tubes or bags filled with adobe to form a compression structure. The resulting beehive-shaped structures employ corbelled arches, corbelled domes, and vaults to create sturdy single and double-curved shells. It has received growing interest for the past two decades in the natural building and sustainability movements. History Although it is not known exactly how long, Earth bag shelters have been used for decades, primarily as implements of refuge in times of war. Military infantrymen have used sand filled sacks to create bunkers and barriers for protection prior to World War I. In the last century other earthbag buildings have undergone extensive research and are slowly beginning to gain worldwide recognition as a plausible solution to provide affordable housing. German architect Frei Otto is said to have experimented with earth bags, as is more recently Gernot Minke. It was Nader Khalili who popularized earthbag construction. Initially in 1984 in response to a NASA call for housing designs for future human settlements on the Moon and on Mars, he proposed to use moon dust to fill the plastic Superadobe tubes and velcro together the layers (instead of barbed wire). He came to term his particular technique of earthbag construction \\"Superadobe\\". Some projects have been done using bags as low-tech foundations for straw-bale construction. They can be covered in a waterproof membrane to keep the straw dry. In 1995, 15 refugee shelters were built in Iran, by Nader Khalili and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in response to refugees from the Persian Gulf War. According to Khalili the cluster of 15 domes that was built could have been repeated by the thousands. The government dismantled the camp a few years later. Since then, the Superadobe Method has been put to use in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Belize, Costa Rica, Chile, Iran, India, Russia, Mali, and Thailand, as well as in the U.S. While Superadobe constructions have generally been limited to approximately 4 meters in diameter, larger structures have been created by grouping several \\"beehives\\" together to form a network of domes. There is a 32‚Ä≤ (10m) dome being constructed in the San Ignacio area of Belize, which when finished will be the centre dome of an eco-resort complex. BBC News reported in March 2019 that superadobe structures have withstood earthquakes as severe as 7.2 magnitude. Methodology Superadobe's earthbag technique lends itself to a wide range of materials. Polypropylene tubing is ideal, although burlap is also sufficient. Likewise, while sand, cement or lime are preferred, virtually any fill material (e.g. gravel, crushed volcanic rock or rice hulls) will work. After materials are gathered and the dimensions of the building are decided upon, a circular foundation trench is dug, approximately 1 foot deep and 8‚Äì14 feet in diameter, giving room for at least two layers of earthbags to be laid down underground. A chain is anchored to the ground in the center of the circle and used like a pair of compasses to trace the shape of the base. Another chain is fastened just outside the dome wall: this is the fixed or height guide and provides an interior measurement for the layers as they corbel higher, ensuring the accuracy of each new layer as it is laid and tamped. Between layers of tamped, filled tubes, loop of barbed wire functions as mortar and holds the structure together. Window voids can be placed in several ways: either by rolling the filled tube back on itself around a circular plug (forming an arched header) or by sawing out a Gothic or pointed arch void after the filler material has set. Once the corbelled dome is complete, it can be covered in several different kinds of exterior treatments, both for aesthetic reasons and to protect the structure from environmental damage such as that from ultraviolet radiation. Like the materials for the construction itself, there are multiple choices. While CalEarth names plaster as the most common finishing option, soil and living grass have also been used. Khalili has also used a mix of earth and plaster, further covered by a \\"reptile\\" layer of cement and earth balls that strengthen the finish by redirecting stress. Emergency shelters According to Khalili's website, in an emergency, impermanent shelters can be built with unskilled labor, using only dirt with no cement or lime, and for the sake of speed of construction windows can be punched out later due to the strength of the compressive nature of the dome/beehive. Superadobe is not an exact art and similar materials may be substituted if the most ideal ones are not readily available. Ordinary sand bags can also be used to form the dome if no Superadobe tubes can be procured; this in fact was how the original design was developed. In an interview with an AIA (American Institute of Architects) representative, Nader Khalili, Superadobe's founder and figurehead, said this about the emergency shelter aspects of Superadobe: Bibliography *Khalili, Nader. \\"Nader Khalili.\\" Cal- Earth. 19 Jan. 2007 . *Katauskas, Ted. \\"Dirt-Cheap Houses from Elemental Materials.\\" Architecture Week.

He played hurling at with his local club Ballyduff and with the Kerry senior inter-county team in the 1890s. Mahony captained Kerry to their only All-Ireland hurling title in 1891. Biography John Mahony was born in Kilmore, Ballyduff, County Kerry in 1864. The son of John and Bridget (n√©e Doran), he grew up in an area that was and still is famous for hurling. Like many of his contemporaries Mahony earned his living from fishing and from thatching roofs. He later gained a reputation as a fine sportsman and as an outspoken individual. John Mahony died at Christmas time in 1943. Playing career =Club= Mahony played his club hurling with his local club in Ballyduff and enjoyed some success. He won his first senior county title in 1891 following a 1-0 to 0-2 defeat of Kilmoyley in the county final. It was Ballyduff‚Äôs first victory in the county championship and their last until 1955. =Inter-county= Ballyduff‚Äôs county championship victory allowed the club to represent Kerry in the Munster and All-Ireland championships. Mahony, one of the stalwarts of the team, was also appointed captain for the year. The semi-final of the Munster Championship saw Kerry take on Cork, the reigning All-Ireland champions. In spite of facing an uphill battle Mahony‚Äôs side easily defeated ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô by 2-7 to 0-3. This victory allowed Kerry to advance to the Munster final where Limerick provided the opposition. The death of Charles Stewart Parnell and the political tensions of the era meant that the playing of game was in doubt; however, it eventually went ahead. Kerry, however, were defeated on that occasion by 1-2 to 1-1. Kerry, however, launched an objection and were successful, thus forcing a replay. Kerry were far superior in the second game, displaying their overhead and ground skills, and defeated Limerick by 2-4 to 0-1. This victory allowed Kerry to advance to the All-Ireland where Wexford provided the opposition. The game itself was the second game of a triple-header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This was followed by the All-Ireland furling final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider was an exciting affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry‚Äôs first point after five minutes with the team‚Äôs second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0-2 to 0-1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third half-hour of hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All- Ireland final. Kerry went on to win the game by 2-3 to 1-5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland title.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . with or without dyskeratosis. Once confirmed, most cases of Grover's disease last six to twelve months, which is why it was originally called \\"transient\\". However it may last much longer. Nevertheless, it is not to be confused with relapsing linear acantholytic dermatosis. Signs and symptoms Advanced case, third month Advanced case, fifth monthGrover's disease often starts quite suddenly. There are intensely itchy spots on the central back, mid chest and occasionally elsewhere. Frequently, it follows sweating or some unexpected heat stress. The itchy eruption lasts an average of 10‚Äì12 months. It is characterized by papules and papulovesicles with excoriations occurring on the chest, back, lower sternum, arms, and thighs. The papules are most commonly found on the mid chest. Sometimes the features of Grover's are found in people who do not itch or have a conspicuous rash. Most of the people with Grover's who visit a dermatologist, however, itch a lot. Cause The cause of Grover's disease is unknown. Suspected triggers of disease activity include heat and sweating, sunlight, and adverse reaction to medications as well as ionizing radiation, end-stage renal disease/hemodialysis, and mechanical irritation or prolonged bed rest. Some cases of Grover's disease have been associated with medications such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, ribavirin, cetuximab, and interleukin-4 [1,8-15]. One series of 300 patients with Grover's disease reported an association with other coexisting dermatoses including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and xerosis cutis. Finally, smaller series have detailed an association with pyoderma gangrenosum, bacterial and viral infections, and occasionally, malignancies. Diagnosis Grover's may be suspected by its appearance, but since it has such a characteristic appearance under the microscope a shave skin or punch biopsy is often performed. Treatment Sweating causes lesions to form, but lesions aggravated by sweat usually return to \\"normal\\" fairly quicklyavoiding sweat is not a reason to avoid exercise. Minor outbreaks can be controlled with prescription strength topical cortisone creams. More severe eruptions usually clear up after treatment for one to three months with Accutane or tetracycline. If these fail or the outbreak is severe, PUVA phototherapy treatments, antifungal medication and cortisone injections are alternatives. Some research has suggested a correlation of Grover's disease with mercury toxicity in which case Dimercaptosuccinic acid might help. Epidemiology The prevalence and incidence of Grover's disease have not been firmly established. In a study from Switzerland, Grover's disease was diagnosed in just 24 of more than 30,000 skin biopsies [4]. Grover's disease is mainly seen in males over the age of forty. Grover's disease affects chiefly white adults in the fifth decade or later, and appears to be around 1.6 to 2.1 times more common in men than in women. Grover's disease appears less commonly in darker- skinned individuals.http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~JmwJAF8q.xf7GjV History This condition was first reported in 1975 by the American dermatopathologist, Ralph Wier Grover (1920‚Äì2008) while working at Franklin Hospital in New York.

It is named for the Wissahickon gorge in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. In Maryland formations, the term \\"Wissahickon\\" is no longer used. Rocks in this classification have since been divided into several units, such as Lower Pelitic Schist and Prettyboy Schist.Geologic Maps of Maryland: Eastern Piedmont Metasedimentary Rocks Description The Wissahickon is described as a pelitic schist and gneiss with interlayers of quartzite. Color is highly variable as is the mineralogy.Blackmer, G.C., (2005). Preliminary Bedrock Geologic Map of a Portion of the Wilmington 30- by 60-Minute Quadrangle, Southeastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Open-File Report OFBM-05-01.0. A general description for the unit is a silver to brown garnet mica-schist. =Metamorphic grade= The highly variable nature of this rock type is also why the metamorphic grade is also complex. The existence of the minerals biotite, garnet, staurolite, and kyanite all imply a low- intermediate to high metamorphic grade. The metamorphic facies, which is described as lower to upper amphibolite facies, implies a moderate to high metamorphic temperature and a moderate pressure. Age =Depositional age= The age indicated on the most recent geologic map of southeast Pennsylvania shows the Wissahickon being Ediacaran to Cambrian in age. This age is a relative date since the sediments that created the Wissahickon are highly deformed and went through several deformation events. =Deformation age= The sediments of the Wissahickon were altered during the Taconic orogeny and most dates do not place the deformation older than the Silurian. Although there is some evidence of Devonian-aged deformation.Bosbyshell, H., (2001). Thermal evolution of a convergent orogen: Pressure-Temperature- Deformation-Time paths in the central Appalachian Piedmont of Pennsylvania and Delaware:[Ph.D. thesis]: Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., 233 p. Divisions The current map sought to divide the Wissahickon into three informal units. The type described here has been the restricted Wissahickon, or its easternmost section that exists in the City of Philadelphia and eastern Delaware County. The Glenarm Wissahickon and Mt. Cuba Wissahickon are two units described in western Delaware and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania. The metamorphic and depositional histories of these two series are different from the Wissahickon type described here. Economic uses Cliveden, Philadelphia Wissahickon schist is quarried as a building stone and is used primarily as a decorative stone rather than a weight bearing stone.

According to Elise Lawton Smith,Elise Lawton Smith (2002), Evelyn Pickering De Morgan and the Allegorical Body (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press) the painting \\"exhibits a Pre-Raphaelite fascination with medieval subjects and decorative detailing.\\" The Love Potion pushed the boundaries of society's expectations of women by ‚Äúexploring the nature of female authority through the practice of sorcery.\\" The painting differs from most of De Morgan's earlier works by featuring a sorceress as the subject, rather than a Christian or mythological figure. The sorceress is dressed in an ornate gold gown, which is symbolic of her mastery of skill and the final stage of the alchemical system of progression toward salvation. Her mastery is further evidenced by leather bound books on the shelf, which were popular alchemy texts during the late nineteenth century. The subject sits in profile, which creates a sense of intensity and authority. Her intent stare is fixated on the potion she is mixing in her chalice, which mirrors the gold and sapphire blue of her gown. This repetition of color reinforced the idea that whatever potion she is creating may be for personal gain. A couple is seen embracing in the background directly above the chalice, which suggests that the potion may also have to do with them. This idea is further supported by a piece of white cloth draped on the bench behind the sorceress, which looks like it's the missing piece from the woman's dress. In the foreground of the work is a black cat with perfectly round, glowing green eyes. The cat's eyes mirror the green circular glass detail above the sorceress, which gives the illusion of many eyes watching her at work. The cat resembles the cat seen in the foreground of Edouard Manet's painting Olympia, in which the animal is a symbol of prostitution. Although the sorceress in The Love Potion is not a prostitute, the purpose of the cat may still work to symbolize similar taboo practices such as alchemy, which was also frowned upon in Edwardian society. The colours of the setting sun in the background create a mysterious setting, further suggesting something illicit is taking place. The Love Potion is an example of De Morgan's characteristic use of bold colors and strong female imagery. Although the subject matter differs slightly from the majority of her works, it displays her style and impeccable attention to detail.

It was released by the International Organization for Standardization on 1 November 2010 and its goal is to contribute to global sustainable development by encouraging business and other organizations to practice social responsibility to improve their impacts on their workers, their natural environments and their communities. This standard was developed by ISO/TMBG Technical Management Board - groups. Structure The structure of ISO 26000 is as follows: #Scope #Terms and definitions #Understanding social responsibility #Principles of social responsibility #Recognizing social responsibility and engaging stakeholders #Guidance on social responsibility core subjects #Guidance on integrating social responsibility throughout an organization. Voluntary Guidance Standard for All Organizations ISO 26000 offers guidance on socially responsible behavior and possible actions. There are three ways in which it is different from the more widespread standards designed for companies to use to meet particular requirements for activities such as manufacturing, managing, accounting and reporting: #ISO 26000 is a voluntary guidance standard: it does not contain requirements such as those used when a standard is offered for \\"certification\\". There is a certain learning curve associated with using ISO 26000, because there is no specific external reward - certification - explicitly tied to ISO 26000. ISO recommends that users say, for example, that they have \\"used ISO 26000 as a guide to integrate social responsibility into our values and practices\\". #ISO 26000 is designed for use by all organizations, not only businesses and corporations. Organizations such as hospitals and schools, charities (not-for-profits), etc. are also included. ISO 26000 makes particular efforts to show that its flexibility means that it can be applied by small businesses and other groups as well ISO26000:2010 Box 3, \\"ISO 26000 and small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs)\\" So far, many of the earliest users of ISO 26000 have been multi-national corporations, especially those based in Europe, and East Asia, particularly Japan. #ISO 26000 was developed through a multi-stakeholder process, meeting in eight Working Group Plenary Sessions between 2005 and 2010, with additional committee meetings and consultations on e-mail throughout the five-year process. Approximately five hundred delegates participated in this process, drawn from six stakeholder groups: Industry, Government, NGO (non-governmental organization), Labour, Consumer, and SSRO (Service, Support, Research and Others - primarily academics and consultants). Leadership of various task groups and committees was \\"twinned\\" between \\"developing\\" and \\"developed\\" countries, to ensure viewpoints from different economic and cultural contexts. Since ISO operates on a parliamentary procedure form based on consensus, the final agreed-on standard was the result of deliberation and negotiations; no one group was able to block it, but also no one group was able to achieve its objectives when others strongly disagreed. The goal was to make ISO 26000 accessible and usable by all organizations, in different countries, precisely because it reflects the goals and concerns of each and all of the stakeholder groups in its final compromise form. Key Principles and Core Subjects of ISO 26000 The Seven Key Principles, advocated as the roots of socially responsible behavior, are: * Accountability * Transparency * Ethical behavior * Respect for stakeholder interests (stakeholders are individuals or groups who are affected by, or have the ability to impact, the organization's actions) * Respect for the rule of law * Respect for international norms of behavior * Respect for human rights The Seven Core Subjects, which every user of ISO 26000 should consider, are: * Organizational governance * Human rights * Labor practices * Environment * Fair operating practices * Consumer issues * Community involvement and development Many of the 84 pages of the standard are devoted to definitions, examples, and suggestions on how to identify and communicate with stakeholders, and how to identify and address specific issues in each Core Subject area. To Obtain a Copy of ISO 26000 ISO 26000 is available for sale by National Standards Bodies in many countries. Prices are set by the different National Standards Bodies, and vary widely. ISO 26000 is available in many national and international languages, including Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kazakh, Korean, Montenegrin, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Vietnamese.

User Guides to ISO 26000 There is a growing number of user guides, many of which are significantly less expensive than the standard itself. Quality and applicability of these guides will vary widely. An assessment tool has been worked out e.g. by The Royal Norwegian Society for Development (Norges Vel), supported by the Asociatia Pentru Implementarea Democratiei (AID -Romania).http://responsabilitate-sociala.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/08/ISO_26000_Practical_Guide_SITE.pdf The ISO's International Workshop Agreement IWA 26:2017 provides guidance on \\"using ISO 26000:2010 in management systems\\".ISO, IWA 26:2017 - https://www.iso.org/standard/72669.html, published August 2017, accessed 18 August 2020 Additional information and critiques The ISO 26000 Scope states \\"This International Standard is not a management system standard. It is not intended or appropriate for certification purposes or regulatory or contractual use. Any offer to certify, or claims to be certified, to ISO 26000 would be a misrepresentation of the intent and purpose and a misuse of this International Standard. As this International Standard does not contain requirements, any such certification would not be a demonstration of conformity with this International Standard.\\" ISO 26000:2010 Clause 1, p. 1 This statement includes that ISO 26000 cannot be used as basis for audits, conformity tests and certificates, or for any other kind of compliance statements. It can however be used as a statement of intention by the CEO and this is seen as its main value. The practical value of ISO 26000 has been debated. It might be limited if it merely provided a common understanding of social responsibility instead of also facilitating management routines and practices leading to social responsibility. Despite the non-certifiability, some scholars see distinct elements of a management system standard also in ISO 26000.E.g., Hahn, R. (2012): \\"Standardizing Social Responsibility? New Perspectives on Guidance Documents and Management System Standards for Sustainable Development\\". In: IEEE - Transactions on Engineering Management Against this background, the potential benefits of the new standard, the managerial relevance, and specific limitations of ISO 26000 are currently being discussed.For a largely positive assessment see e.g., Hahn, R. (2012): \\"Standardizing Social Responsibility? New Perspectives on Guidance Documents and Management System Standards for Sustainable Development\\". In: IEEE - Transactions on Engineering Management . A largely pessimistic view can be found in, for example, Schwarz, B. & Tilling, K. (2009): \\"‚ÄòISO-lating‚Äô Corporate Social Responsibility in the Organizational Context: A Dissenting Interpretation of ISO 26000\\". In: Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management Critiques include the lack of any certification, the potential to \\"decouple\\" and isolate corporate social responsibility issues in an organization (Schwarz & Tilling 2009), the difficulty for smaller organizations to access the 100-plus-page \\"textbook\\" form of the standard, and the fact that the best practices represented by the standard tend to age; to address at least this last concern, interested parties are tracking the need and timing of a possible update. There is also a concern that ISO 26000 is just one among \\"too many\\" social impact reporting standards available to corporations. As a guidance document the ISO 26000 is an offer, voluntary in use, and encourages organizations to discuss their social responsibility issues and possible actions with relevant stakeholders. As service providers, certification bodies do not belong to an organization's stakeholders. ISO 26000 encourages its users to reconsider an organization's social responsibility or \\"socially responsible behaviour\\" and to identify/select from its recommendations those where the organization could/should engage in contributions to society. ISO 26000 encourages its users to report to their stakeholders, and get feedback, on actions taken to improve their social responsibility. It is this identification of \\"stakeholders\\" that makes the ISO 26000 an important step forward in solving the dilemma presented by corporations still in pursuit of single bottom line accountability, moving the discussion beyond Triple Bottom Line Accountability. It is also an important step in the development of business-led social responsibility initiatives which evidence suggests is much more effective than government-regulated social responsibly policies. Project aim There is a range of many different opinions as to the right approach to ethical and socially responsible behavior by businesses, ranging from strict legislation at one end to complete freedom at the other. ISO 26000 is looking for a golden middle way that promotes respect and responsibility based on known reference documents without stifling creativity and development. ISO (established 1947 to promote international trade by developing manufacturing standards) is now composed of 162 members, each of which is a National Standards Board of a particular country. ISO's expansion into the field of Social Responsibility (Corporate Social Responsibility) was driven by many factors, including a recognition that the pace of global development calls for increasing actions by organizations, including businesses, to reduce their harmful impacts on people and communities, and increase their positive impacts. Development leadership ISO chose Swedish Standards Institute (SIS) and ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards to provide the joint leadership of the ISO Working Group on Social Responsibility (WG SR). The WG SR was given the task of drafting an International Standard for social responsibility that was published in 2010 as ISO 26000.Hahn, R. (2012): \\"Transnational Governance, Deliberative Democracy, and the Legitimacy of ISO 26000\\". In: Business and Society Target: wide range The need for organizations in both public and private sectors to behave in a socially responsible way is becoming a generalized requirement of society. It is shared by the stakeholder groups that participated in the WG SR to develop ISO 26000: industry, government, labour, consumers, nongovernmental organizations, and others, in addition to geographical and gender-based balance.For a detailed analysis of the ISO 26000 development process see Hahn, R. (2012): \\"Transnational Governance, Deliberative Democracy, and the Legitimacy of ISO 26000\\". In: Business and Society A Memorandum of Understanding was developed between the ISO Group and the United Nations Global Compact in order to both develop and promote the ISO 26000 as the go to Standard for CSR. Unfortunately the United Nations Global Compact did not fulfill its commitment under that MOU nor subsequent commitments to bring the ISO 26000 to the other 90 UN agencies.

It was proved in 1991 by the Czech mathematician Dana Fra≈àkov√°. Background Let X be a separable Hilbert space, and let BV([0, T]; X) denote the normed vector space of all functions f : [0, T] -> X with finite total variation over the interval [0, T], equipped with the total variation norm. It is well known that BV([0, T]; X) satisfies the compactness theorem known as Helly's selection theorem: given any sequence of functions (fn)n‚ààN in BV([0, T]; X) that is uniformly bounded in the total variation norm, there exists a subsequence :\\\\left( f_{n(k)} \\\\right) \\\\subseteq (f_{n}) \\\\subset \\\\mathrm{BV}([0, T]; X) and a limit function f ‚àà BV([0, T]; X) such that fn(k)(t) converges weakly in X to f(t) for every t ‚àà [0, T].

Consider now the Banach space Reg([0, T]; X) of all regulated functions f : [0, T] -> X, equipped with the supremum norm. Helly's theorem does not hold for the space Reg([0, T]; X): a counterexample is given by the sequence :f_{n} (t) = \\\\sin (n t). One may ask, however, if a weaker selection theorem is true, and the Fra≈àkov√°-Helly selection theorem is such a result. Statement of the Fra≈àkov√°-Helly selection theorem As before, let X be a separable Hilbert space and let Reg([0, T]; X) denote the space of regulated functions f : [0, T] -> X, equipped with the supremum norm. Let (fn)n‚ààN be a sequence in Reg([0, T]; X) satisfying the following condition: for every Œµ > 0, there exists some LŒµ > 0 so that each fn may be approximated by a un ‚àà BV([0, T]; X) satisfying :\\\\ f_{n} - u_{n} \\\\_{\\\\infty} < \\\\varepsilon and : u_{n}(0)  + \\\\mathrm{Var}(u_{n}) \\\\leq L_{\\\\varepsilon}, where - denotes the norm in X and Var(u) denotes the variation of u, which is defined to be the supremum :\\\\sup_{\\\\Pi} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m}  u(t_{j}) - u(t_{j-1})  over all partitions :\\\\Pi = \\\\\\\\{ 0 = t_{0} < t_{1} < \\\\dots < t_{m} = T , m \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\\\\\} of [0, T]. Then there exists a subsequence :\\\\left( f_{n(k)} \\\\right) \\\\subseteq (f_{n}) \\\\subset \\\\mathrm{Reg}([0, T]; X) and a limit function f ‚àà Reg([0, T]; X) such that fn(k)(t) converges weakly in X to f(t) for every t ‚àà [0, T].

Traditional silicon based solar cells are expensive to manufacture, rigid and fragile. Although less efficient, thin-film cells and organic polymer based cells can be produced quickly and cheaply. They are also flexible and can be stitched onto fabric. According to an article from New Scientist NewScientist researchers have built a PV cell in the layers around a fiber, creating a tiny cylindrical cell. No longer limited to rooftops and poles, solar collection could work silently and unobtrusively from everyday objects. Examples of recent research Flexible solar cells can be used in humanitarian aid. A makeshift shelter developed by PowerFilm, Inc. called the PowerShade can generate one kilowatt of power. This could help a power emergency equipment at short notice in remote places. Konarka Technologies produce a thin film polymer based PV cell, as a flexible film stitched onto a fabric. The ability to make these cells even smaller is dependent on further research into nanocrystal PV cells. In theory nanotechnology could provide a way to expand the range of photons a cell could collect, increasing its efficiency while becoming smaller. Konarka, in partner with other institutions, is working on this. ShadePlex is currently developing a product that integrates thin film photovoltaic modules with architectural fabrics. They will feature a high power output (200 W, 500 W, and 1000 W), and can feed either a battery system or be tied to the grid. Integrating thin film photovoltaics with fabric structures will enable a whole class of buildings to easily integrate renewable energy solutions.

History The oldest plank house village found is located in Kitselas Canyon at the Paul Mason Site in western British Columbia, Canada. This village is estimated to be 3000 years old. At the Maurer site in British Columbia the remains of a rectangular building have been excavated, providing artifacts which date the site to between 1920 and 2830 BCE.\\"Investigations at the Maurer Site near Agassiz\\", Ronald LeClair, http://monographs.lib.sfu.ca/index.php/sfulibrary/catalog/download/43/15/686-1?inline=1, retrieved October 2017 Material Due to the nature of this building material, the anthropological documentation for these people is not widespread. The manner of wood harvest and continued use of that harvest was purposeful and sustainable. Native people of the Pacific Northwest maintained a distinct respect for cedar and the value it had held for many generations.\\"Cedar: Tree of Life to the Northwest Coast Indians,\\" by Hilary Stewart describes and illustrates the harvesting of individual planks from living trees. Cedar logs compose the primary support system of the plank houses of the Pacific Northwest Indians, and are clad with thick cedar planks harvested from living trees. Cedar trees have a straight grain with very few knots and have good weather resistance. The straight grain enables the separation of planks of wood from the tree. Craftspeople would insert a wedgearate a section of wood through the height of the tree and removed it with an adze at both ends. This harvest method was sustainable and enabled the people to use the wood and to have a supply of planks to rebuild in another location. The patience of the people is evident in the practice of leaving the wedge in place to continue the pressure that would enable another wedge placement further up, creating longer planks. Construction Canadian anthropologist Wilson Duff quotes Simon Fraser, who (upon observation of the Coast Salish homes on the banks of the now named Fraser River) wrote in his 1800 journal; \\"as an excellent house 46 √ó 32 and constructed like American frame houses; the planks are three to 4 inches thick, each plank overlapping the adjoining one a couple of inches; the post, which are very strong and crudely carved, received across beams; the walls are 11 feet high and covered with a slanting roof. On the opposite side of the river there is a considerable village with houses similar to the one on the side.\\" Kenneth Ames, contributor to Life in the Big House; Household Labor and Dwelling Size on the Northwest Coast, calculates the volume of wood in this house to exceed half a million board feet (1,200 m¬≥). A multi-family house found in Nanaimo, on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, Canada, is documented as being made of split cedar planks that were \\"held in place by withes (cedar rope) that come from the long lower branches of Cedar trees that grow in open spaces.\\" (Fraser) Chinookan plank house, illustration by Wilkes in the 1850s. Many important details are seen here, including the use of a plank floor, a large, central hearth, sleeping and storage bunks, and the drying/smoking rack above the fire. There is also a dog, and a musket propped in the rear left corner. The cedar ropes that secured the planks to the uprights and beams allowed the people to deconstruct their homes and bring their planks with them to the next location. These planks were neither small nor easily obtained, but they were valuable assets and, as such, they were transported with the household goods during the seasonal migrations. The house frames were left intact until the next season, when the people returned and reattached their traveling planks and reconstructed their home. There were two distinct roof types found in this region. Both types are placed on a rectangular house that has a hearth or fire pit. One type consists of gabled, paired ridgepoles, vertical walls, and roof planks with an interior pit that was reached via steps. James Cook described the shed roof structures on Vancouver Island and around Puget Sound. His description is that of a cruder type of building that may have been in the adaptive stages of the house type possibly brought to the coast by the Salish people, who modified as needed with the change in location. These shed roof houses are the largest constructed anywhere in this region. The articles that have been written by anthropologists describe the shed roofs as being shed type that are not consistent in description as to the roof pitch. One informant will state that the roof was slanted to the back of the house, and another will say it was pitched to the front, or the side of the house. The roof pitch was adjusted according to the direction from which the rain comes down. Regionally, the rain comes from the south. Replica plank house in the Eyak-Tlingit-Haida-Tsimshian village site, Alaska Native Heritage Center Museum In 1778, during his third mapping voyage, James Cook described the homes he saw at Nootka Sound as not having a door. He described irregular openings through which the Indians passed in and out. The \\"Old Man House\\" had a maze \\"consisting of a series of parallel walls partly uncovering each other, around which the visitor had to pass.\\" The maze ended in a dark area that housed the fire pit. One explanation for this configuration was as a defense against intruders. Alternately, because the lack of doors and the cedar mat room dividers did little to keep the wind and rain out, the mats may have served as windbreaks. Anthropologist Ronald Leroy Olson, whose subjects were the Quinault, Tlingit and Kwakiutl tribes, defines the coasts of the Pacific Northwest as the place for rectangular plank houses, from the coastal region of British Columbia to the mouth of the Copper River in Alaska, with one exception: the Athabascan Tseutsaut of the head of Portland Canal, who used temporary brush and bark lodges. The Alaskan people are more likely to use spruce wood, which has characteristics similar to cedar, due to the availability of that resource. Cedar was the material of choice for the coastal people of southwestern Canada, and Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.

Like other hermit crabs, their abdomen is not calcified and they use snail shells as protection.

His father, Clifford Leon Sherman, worked in the art department of The Boston Globe. He made his Broadway debut as a playwright with the short-lived comedy Too Much Party in 1934. The farce, directed by William Friedlander, opened at the Theatre Masque on March 5, 1934, and closed after only eight performances. It proved to be his sole attempt at writing. Two years later he made his Broadway debut as an actor in the Federal Theatre Project's Horse Eats Hat. Additional theatre credits include the inaugural Mercury Theatre productions Caesar and The Shoemaker's Holiday, Very Warm for May, Cyrano de Bergerac, Boyd's Daughter (which he also directed) and Mary, Mary. He won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Two's Company and How Now, Dow Jones. Sherman debuted on stage in London in 1949 in Brigadoon. He appeared in London's West End as Matthew Cuthbert in the British premiere of Anne of Green Gables. On television, Sherman portrayed Simon Ward on The Tammy Grimes Show. His other television credits included such early anthology series as Kraft Television Theatre, Studio One, The Alcoa Hour, and Hallmark Hall of Fame. Sherman's debuted on film in One Third of a Nation (1939). His feature films included The Solid Gold Cadillac, Mary, Mary, in which he reprised his role in the play, and Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad.

It was issued on 25 September 1981 by Polydor Records as two 7\\" single records in a \\"double-album\\" style card cover, and is usually referred to as an EP. It peaked in the UK Singles Chart at No. 24,\\"Wild Things Creatures Uk Charts\\". Officialcharts.com. Retrieved 8-5-2012 and the pair performed \\"Mad Eyed Screamer\\" on Top of the Pops. The EP was entirely remastered in 1997 and reissued as part of the A Bestiary Of CD compilation. History The initial idea for Wild Things, and the Creatures, came about during the recording sessions for the Siouxsie and the Banshees album Juju. While bassist Steven Severin and guitarist John McGeoch took a break, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie created the song \\"But Not Them.\\" Deciding that it was complete as a drum-and-voice piece, they left it alone, and quickly recorded four more minimal tracks to accompany it. The result was the Wild Things EP (so named by Severin, who upon hearing it, said it sounded like something the creatures in the book Where the Wild Things Are would have danced to on their island). The only cover version on the EP was the Troggs' \\"Wild Thing\\"; Siouxsie added extra angry lyrics to the original \\"Wild thing, I think I hate you/but I wanna know for sure/so come on, hit me hard/I hate you\\". \\"So Unreal\\" drew inspiration from the novel The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin, and \\"Mad Eyed Screamer\\" from local characters met in Hyde Park, London. The duo incorporated the songs \\"But Not Them\\", \\"So Unreal\\" and \\"Thumb\\" into Banshees concerts for many years afterwards. The erotic sleeve art featuring Siouxsie and Budgie half-naked under a shower was inspired by the pictures of Man Ray; the artwork caused some controversy. Another shoot, inspired by the John Millais painting Ophelia, featured the singer naked under many flowers and shallow water. Legacy Singer Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes rated \\"So Unreal\\" as one of her favourite tracks, saying: \\"Siouxsie [has got] sharp lyrics and staccato vocals. Budgie is one of the most interesting drummers in the world. He uses drum sounds melodically as well as rhythmically which makes this drum/vocal duo work. You can hear their passion for each other in these recordings, they are so alive, despite being so minimal\\". David Cheal of the Financial Times wrote about the Creatures' rendition of \\"Wild Thing\\": \\"Perhaps the most striking of those 7,500-odd licensed recordings [of \\"Wild Thing\\"] is [the Creatures version] on which Siouxsie‚Äôs chilly multitracked vocals (at one point she chants, \\"Wild thing, I think I hate you\\") are accompanied only by Budgie's tribal-sounding drums. It‚Äôs a version that taps into the earthy, elemental spirit of the song, channelling those few minutes back in 1964 when Chip Taylor lost himself in the darkness of a New York studio\\".

The Carpenters performed a variety of sketches with guest stars Victor Borge and John Denver. It ended with a hits medley (which can be found without applause on the CD As Time Goes By). The Skits After Karen, Richard and the orchestra perform \\"We've Only Just Begun\\", they show a clip of Richard conducting the orchestra playing a different version of \\"We've Only Just Begun\\", with Karen's voice-over talking about how much Richard loves conducting orchestras. After the orchestra's finished, the Carpenters performed \\"Top of the World\\", which can be found on the VHS Yesterday Once More (repackaged as Gold: Greatest Hits on DVD in 2002). On top of that, Richard and Karen perform a \\"Spike Jones and the City Slickers\\" style parody version of \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\", beginning with a harp introduction. The duo also performed \\"These Are the Jokes\\" on the same set as the one of \\"Top of the World\\", only with a black background instead of a blue background. John Denver and Karen Carpenter did a duet together of a medley consisting of a cleaned up version of Robert Burns' \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" and the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\". The amazing thing about this medley is that in parts, Denver may be singing \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\", while Carpenter sings \\"Good Vibrations\\". They did a skit of Karen's drumming talent as well. It begins with Richard and Karen talking about why Karen played the drums, and Karen says, \\"Why not!!\\" Then, they reminisce to the high school days, where classmate John Denver played the drums in the high school band, and Karen was stuck with the glockenspiel. They told how Karen obtained the drums, and fell in love with it immediately. After that scene, Karen plays a medley including \\"Strike Up the Band\\" and \\"'S Wonderful\\". In the end, the band and the orchestra combined together, and performed a Hits Medley to close the show.

He was Liberal Chief Whip and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Parliamentary Party. Political positions Percy Harris was regarded as a radical Liberal with a strong social conscience, which grew from representing a working-class area of the East End of London. He was particularly interested in the issue of social housing, a major responsibility of the London County Council. Harris sided with H. H. Asquith against David Lloyd George in 1918‚Äì23. Thereafter, he sought unity within the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party split in 1931 over the issue of free trade, he sided with Sir Herbert Samuel and against the Liberal National breakaway led by Sir John Simon. Under the leadership of Sir Archie Sinclair, he rose to prominence in the party. Harris was a strong supporter of the social policies advocated by Sir William Beveridge and was key to getting Beveridge to run for the Liberals.Malcolm Baines (1998) \\"Sir Percy Harris\\" in Brack et al.

Ashford was a safe Conservative seat that they had won at every election since the seat was created in 1885. He was not expected to win and in an election that saw the Liberals sweep the country Harris came within 400 votes of toppling his Conservative opponent. Harris next contested the 1907 London County Council election for the Progressive Party, the municipal wing of the Liberal Party. He contested Bethnal Green South West alongside his running mate Stewart Headlam and they were both elected. In 1910, Harris contested the January 1910 general election as Liberal candidate for the Harrow division of Middlesex. Harrow was a safe Conservative seat that had been unexpectedly won by the Liberal James Gibb in 1906. Gibb had decided to retire and Harris was given the hard task of defending the seat. Harris had attended school in Harrow so knew the area a little. In a tougher year for the Liberals, Harrow was re-taken by the Conservatives. Harris did not contest the December 1910 general election. When the Liberal MP for Bethnal Green South West resigned his seat in 1911, Harris was keen to win the Liberal nomination for the 1911 Bethnal Green South West by-election, however, he withdrew in favour of Charles Masterman. He then focused on his duties at the London County Council. In 1912, Harris was appointed as the Chief Whip for the Progressives.‚ÄòHARRIS, Rt Hon.

Harborough was a Liberal seat where the elderly sitting member had decided to retire at the next election. However, the outbreak of war postponed the general election. In 1915, Harris was elected Deputy Chairman of the London County Council. In the meantime, the health of the Liberal MP for Harborough deteriorated and he resigned from parliament causing the 1916 Harborough by-election. Harris was re-adopted by the local Liberals and his candidacy was also officially endorsed by both the Unionist and Labour parties, due to the wartime electoral truce. However, Harris faced a strong opponent in the by-election who received much Unionist support as well as strong support from prominent newspaper barons.Percy Harris (1947) Forty Years In and Out of Parliament; Andrew Melrose Despite this, Harris was elected to Parliament. In May 1918, when H. H. Asquith challenged Prime Minister David Lloyd George in the Maurice Debate, Harris sided with Asquith and went into the division lobby against the Coalition Government. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1918 general election when his Unionist opponent was endorsed by the Coalition Government. In 1919, Harris was engaged in correspondence with John Wycliffe Black, Chairman of the Harborough Divisional Liberal Association, about the amount of money Harris was expected to contribute if he wished to remain as Parliamentary candidate. In the end Harris was not able to meet the requirements of the divisional Liberal association and sought another constituency. Black was then adopted by Harborough Liberals as their candidate.Chris Cook (1975) The Age of Alignment: Electoral politics in Britain, 1922‚Äì1929, Macmillan. pp. 40-41 =Bethnal Green South West= The split with the Harborough Liberals gave Harris the freedom to pursue a parliamentary career in Bethnal Green South West, the seat he represented on the LCC. The parliamentary seat had a chequered history; the Liberals had won the seat on eight occasions but had lost it three times. At the last election in 1918, the Liberal candidate had finished third with just 24%, behind a socialist candidate supported by the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers. At the 1922 general election, Harris faced the Unionist MP who had taken the seat from the Liberals in 1914 and a Communist who had Labour Party support. The sitting Unionist member finished third and Harris re-gained the seat polling over 40% of the vote. Harris repeated his victory in 1923 when his Communist opponent ran as an official Labour Party candidate and in 1924 when that opponent once more ran as a Communist. The 1924 election was a very bad election for the Liberals nationwide but Harris's support had held up very well. During the 1924‚Äì29 parliament which was dominated by a Unionist majority, Harris worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included William Wedgwood Benn, Frank Briant, Joseph Kenworthy and Horace Crawfurd to provide opposition to the government. Harris avoided getting involved in the Liberal Party in-fighting of the time and supported the radical policy platforms of the party presented under Lloyd George's leadership. At the 1929 general election he was easily returned, thanks in part to both the Communist and Labour parties running candidates. =National Government= When the Liberal Party split in 1931 over the National Government, Harris supported Sir Herbert Samuel who wanted the party to stay in the National Government and fight strongly for Free Trade. At the 1931 general election, the Conservatives, who had come fourth in 1929, did not bother to run a candidate against him. Harris was re-elected with nearly 60% of the vote against an opposition split between Labour and Communist. On 14 January 1932, Harris was created a Baronet, as Sir Percy Harris of London. When the Liberal Party left the National Government following the defeat on Free Trade, Harris followed into opposition. At the 1935 general election, he faced just one opponent, a Labour Party candidate who was also opposed to the National Government. Harris held his seat with a reduced majority in a tough election for the Liberals which saw their Leader, sir Herbert Samuel, lose his seat. In 1935, the new Liberal Leader Sir Archie Sinclair appointed Sir Percy Liberal Chief Whip in succession to Walter Rea, who had also lost his seat at the recent general election. =Wartime Government= In 1940, when Liberal Leader Sir Archie Sinclair took up a cabinet position in the Churchill Coalition Government he appointed Harris as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Parliamentary Party in addition to being Chief Whip. The deputy position had been vacant since Sinclair had become leader in 1935. At the same time Harris was appointed a Privy Counsellor. On his shoulders fell much of the responsibility of leading the party in the Commons and in organising the party in the country. The Liberal Party was invigorated by the recruitment to its ranks of Sir William Beveridge, author of the Beveridge Report and optimistically met the electorate at the 1945 general election. However, the election was a disappointment for the party and particularly for Harris who lost his seat in the Labour Party tide. =Latter years= Sir Percy Harris's tombstone in Chiswick In 1946, Harris published his autobiography, Forty Years In and Out of Parliament, Fleet Street Press.‚ÄòHARRIS, Rt Hon.

Harris played a key role in the formation of Liberal International in 1947 and was President of the British Council of LI.Liberals Unite; The Origins Of Liberal International He was re-elected in the 1949 London County Council Elections, but found himself to be the only Liberal on the Council and briefly holding the balance of power between Labour and Conservative. In 1950, Harris sought a similar return to parliament for the new merged seat of Bethnal Green, but in a bad year for the Liberals, finished a distant second. Harris died in Kensington aged 76 in 1952. His monument in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Chiswick is Grade II* listed. The relief carving by Edward Bainbridge Copnall depicts the resurrection of the dead. It was carved in the late 1920s and acquired by Harris for display in his garden at Morton House, Chiswick Mall. =Electoral record= Harrow in Middlesex 1910 Bethnal Green South West in London 1885‚Äì1918 Bethnal Green South West in London 1918‚Äì50 Bethnal Green in London 1950 References Bibliography * Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * Obituary, Jewish Chronicle, 4 July 1952 External links Parliamentary Archives, The Papers of Sir Percy Harris 1876 births 1952 deaths People educated at Harrow School Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies People from Kensington British Jews Jewish British politicians UK MPs 1910‚Äì1918 UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 UK MPs 1924‚Äì1929 UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 UK MPs 1931‚Äì1935 UK MPs 1935‚Äì1945 Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Members of London County Council Progressive Party (London) politicians Deputy Lieutenants of the County of London Members of the Middle Temple ","title":"Percy Harris"},{"id":"9776017","text":"Rockford High School in Rockford, Michigan services grades 10-12 for the Rockford Public Schools.

Thunderbolt 3 to 40Gb Ethernet and both 32Gb and 16Gb Fibre Channel products were also introduced. =Architecture= With the introduction of XstreamCORE ATTO launched two new technologies to help their products stand out against competing architectures. xCORE IO Acceleration features multiple parallel IO acceleration engines with end to end IO processing, hardware buffer allocation management and real-time performance and latency analytics. These features combine to provide very high, reliable throughput and IOPS with deterministic latency of under 4 microseconds. Unlike general purpose processor based architectures xCORE maintains performance and latency as services and features are added. This is accomplished with the help of ATTO's other new technology the eCORE Control Engine. eCORE offloads non-data related commands from xCORE and adds common, open storage services, integrates with industry standard APIs, manages reservations, storage routing and host and mapping functions. The eCORE Control Engine also manages traffic for data mover offload with added error handling and diagnostic tools. These features add value to JBOD, JBOF or RAID storage while providing tight integration with server based software. Products ATTO products are sold directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ODMs, White Box Systems Integrators as well as through ATTO authorized distributors and resellers. Products include: acceleration software, RAID Adapters, and host bus adapters (HBAs) 8Gb, 16Gb and 32Gb Fibre Channel, 12Gb and 6Gb SAS/SATA, and Network Interface Cards (NICs) 40GbE and 10GbE. NetApp is a customer of ATTO and has integrated the ATTO FibreBridge product line in the NetApp MetroCluster business continuity solution. Protocol conversion products, called storage controllers, convert one protocol to another while adding monitoring and management features, for example: Fibre Channel to SAS/SATA, iSCSI to SAS/SATA. Switches are also offered which provide 8, 16, 24, or 48 ports in 16Gb or 8Gb Fibre Channel to enable an end- to-end SAN solution when using Fibre Channel HBAs.

Vitez has written for The Philadelphia Inquirer since 1985 and is known for his human-interest stories. In 1997, Vitez, along with Inquirer photographers April Saul and Ron Cortes, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism for a series of articles he wrote on end-of-life care, telling the stories of terminally ill patients who wished to die with dignity.  Biography  Vitez was born on April 11, 1957, in Washington, DC and grew up in northern Virginia. After graduating from the University of Virginia in 1979, Vitez found positions at a series of middle-sized newspapers, including the Virginian-Pilot/Ledger Star, the Washington Star, and the Hartford Courant before being offered and accepting a position at the Inquirer in 1985. In Philadelphia, Vitez has had a long career as a general-assignment features writer. After completing a year as a Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan in 1994/1995, Vitez began to focus on aging, which persisted after his 1997 Pulitzer Prize win. He has written extensively on the murder-rate in Philadelphia, gun control, along with softer, more community-oriented pieces [2]. As a result of the work he did which led to his Pulitzer Prize win, Vitez wrote 'Final Choices,' a book focusing on individuals in pursuit of a noble death that was published in January 1998. In November 2006, Vitez published 'Rocky Stories,' which was a collection of stories about people who came to Philadelphia to run the famous steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum. The book, which featured glossy, color photos by Inquirer photographer and fellow Pulitzer Prize-winner Tom Gralish, features an introduction by the star of the Rocky movies, Sylvester Stallone. Vitez appeared briefly (uncredited) at the end of the movie Rocky Balboa (film). In 1997, Vitez said of his interests that he tries \\"to celebrate ordinary people around us by showing how ordinary people sometimes do extraordinary things\\".

In 2015, in a post-Ferguson project, Warren conducted exit interviews of 753 people exiting affluent and non-affluent municipal courts in Saint Louis County to find out whether poor, mostly blacks were treated more unfairly than whites. Blacks did express more negative views about how they were treated by municipal courts than whites, although both blacks and whites felt they were treated better by municipal courts located in the affluent communities than the non-affluent communities to a statistically significant extent. Warren has served as an expert witness in over twenty court cases, testifying in Voting Rights Act, redistricting, forum non conveniens, jury challenges, and change of venue cases. Dr. Kenneth F.

The generic name Saxifraga literally means \\"stone-breaker\\", from Latin ' (\\"rock\\" or \\"stone\\") + ' (\\"to break\\"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (such as kidney stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.  Description  Plant without flower Saxifraga paniculata is a perennial and stoloniferous herbaceous plant with flowering stems 10‚Äì30 cm in height. The most easily identifiable feature is its highly dense basal rosette of leaves, which are leathery, flat and stiff. 1‚Äì3 cm long, the oblong to ovate leaves are densely toothed and have fine leaf margins; a lime-encrusted white pore is present at the base of each leaf. The rosettes produce erect flowering stems (though nothing might be produced for a few years), whilst the rosettes themselves grow at the end of runners (horizontal, long stolons). The flowering stems have reduced and scattered leaves which terminate in a somewhat elongated cluster. The flowers are white, approximately 1 cm across and have dots which are either purplish or red. It flowers from mid-to-late June to early August, and produces perfect flowers (as it has both stamens and carpels). The flowers themselves have five petals, two styles, one inferior ovary and a two-beaked seed capsule. Warming (1909) noted that the flowers are protandrous, in the sense that even before the stigmas become receptive the flowers make and disperse pollen. However, as discussed in the 'Ecology' section below, the plant can self-pollinate. Saxifraga paniculata can sometimes be mistaken for another plant in the same genus, Saxifraga tricuspidata (prickly saxifrage); whilst S. tricuspidata does grow in a similar range, it can be differentiated from S. paniculata by its lack of lime-encrusted pores and by its crowded and much narrower leaves, which apart from three terminating stiff spine-tipped teeth have otherwise smooth margins.  Distribution and habitat  Growing in the Circumboreal Region, Saxifraga paniculata can be found throughout Central Europe, Greenland, Iceland and Scandinavia, as well as in the Caucasus and in North America where it can be found in the northern Great Lakes region, New England and New York State. Only historical records document it in Maine, whilst it is present, though considered a rarity, in Vermont, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland Island, New Brunswick, Minnesota and Labrador. Saxifraga paniculata is a calciphile, and hence is found in calcareous habitats: an example of which is in a crevice of a basic rock (including basalt and volcanic rock conglomerates). Of the rock crevices or rock ledges it does grow on, S. paniculata prefers the shady ones. Ecology Its ability to close its leaf rosettes when undergoing deleterious environmental conditions such as excessive heat and droughts gives Saxifraga paniculata a very high resistance to sustained photoinhibition and irreversible dehydration; a paper published by Hacker and Neuner in 2006 found that S. paniculata was more resistant to cold induced photoinhibition in winter than any other evergreen subalpine species that the group had studied. Due to the short growing season and the possible lack of pollinators, S. paniculata (like many arctic plants) can self-pollinate - whilst usually avoided in plant species as there is no potential for genetic variation in offspring, it does still ensure in dire conditions that seed is produced and dispersed. In the wild, Saxifraga paniculata has been observed with many associated species, including but not limited to: Trisetum spicatum, Polygonum viviparum, Polypodium virginianum, Sagina nodosa, Woodsia alpina, Campanula rotundifolia, Rubus pubescens, Aralia nudicaulis, Tortella tortuosa, Aquilegia canadensis, Carex eburnea and Woodsia glabella, as well as lichen cover. Cultivation Saxifraga paniculata is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant. Though hardy, it dislikes winter wetness and requires very sharp drainage in an alkaline or neutral soil. It is therefore often to be found in a rock garden or alpine house. It has given rise to numerous hybrids and cultivars.

TIME: The Plant Hunter, October 1, 1997 Evolutionary ecology Cox began his research in evolutionary ecology as a student of John L. Harper at the University of Wales in Bangor by studying dioecy in plants. At Harvard University where he served for four years as Teaching Fellow for E. O. Wilson, he studied how vertebrate pollination influenced breeding system evolution in tropical lianas. Collaborating at Harvard with tropical botanist P. B. Tomlinson, at Berkeley with Herbert G. Baker, and Melbourne with Bruce Knox, he used mathematical search theory to analyze seagrass pollination and later, with mathematician James Sethian used search theory to develop a new approach to the evolution of different size sperm and eggs, known as anisogamy, a topic he continued to pursue with Japanese biologist Tatsuya Togashi. He discovered with colleagues Sandra Banack and James Metcalf in cyanobacteria AEG, a hypothesized backbone of peptide nucleic acids in the pre-RNA world early in the earth's history.

Ethnobotany Although trained in evolutionary ecology, because of his fluency in Polynesian languages, Cox was encouraged by Harvard Professor Richard Evans Schultes to pursue ethnobotanical studies. He became increasingly focused on ethnomedicine after his mother died from breast cancer. Subsequently, with his colleagues Gordon Cragg, Michael Boyd, and others at the National Cancer Institute, discovered the anti-HIV/AIDS properties of prostratin.Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rainforest.

Members comprise the elite of San Fernando City, who host the dance which opens the annual the fiesta celebrations that culminate on May 30. History Formed sometime in the 1920s, the club succeeded the earlier group called La Gente Alegre de San Fernando (The Merry Folks of San Fernando). According to John Larkin in his book The Pampangans, ‚Äúa new phenomenon, town and provincial social clubs, which sprang up in the early American years, demonstrated how the native upper class flourished under the new regime. These organizations, exclusively for the elite, provided among other things an opportunity for young single adults to socialize with and meet others of the same age and class.‚Äù Larkin later mentions, ‚Äúthe Pampangan elite, a greater number of them emulating late nineteenth century patterns of behavior, turned their attention to peer group organizations, politics, and extra provincial activities. They resolved many of their economic and political problems by banding together into various agricultural organizations and political parties. The trend toward forming upper-class social clubs for amusement also continued. Such groups as the Young Generation in Macabebe, the Kundiman in Angeles, and the Circulo Fernandino in San Fernando were all patterned after organizations formed in the early American years.‚Äù =Later history= El Circulo Fernandino organised annual parties to achieve this, but these were interrupted by the Second World War. The club resumed its social activities after the War, only to be halted again in 1987. In the Fifties, the annual community dance was held at the Riverside Country Club Auditorium, a wooden structure built beside the Pampanga Capitol (seat of Provincial Government at San Fernando). This was large enough to accommodate about a 100 people. The event became popular and neighboring towns were invited. After which it was held in an open-air fenced area at the back of the auditorium. In the Fifties/Sixties big bands the likes of Carding Cruz Band performed for the event. Guests were announced as they enter the gate much like the grand parties of Europe. As part of keeping up with Filipino traditions, the classic Rigodon de Honor (the country's analogue to a court dance), is performed by the prominent citizens of San Fernando. Men are traditionally garbed in their best pi√±a barongs and the women are dressed in colourful ternos and bedecked in jewellery.Henares, Ivan Anthony S. \\" El Circulo Fernandino, keeping up with social tradition\\" In 1997, the club decided to revive its annual receptions under the presidency of Engr. Angelo David and Dr. Leticia Cordero-Yap. The El Circulo Fernandino Foundation, Inc. was formed as a result of this revival, transforming the club from a strictly social club to a more socially-involved organisation. Related celebrations The Thomasian was a social club for residents of nearby Santo Tomas, formed when the town was still part of San Fernando. The organisation hosted the annual S√°bado de Gloria (Holy Saturday) Ball, which is the oldest surviving social event in Pampanga.

She had an older sister, Elizabeth, and never married. Her Norwegian great-grandfather, Martin Br√¶kkan, had been an oboist with a military band in his native Trondheim.Ardis Joan Krainik (Manitowoc County Personal Sketches) She attended the public schools of Manitowoc and graduated from Northwestern University's School of Speech (B.S., 1951) intending to become a teacher. It was at Northwestern that she was encouraged to pursue a career in voice. Northwestern awarded her the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts in 1984.Notable alumni: Music (Northwestern University) Career Following her graduation from college, Krainik took a job as a clerk-typist with the Lyric Opera and eventually was selected to sing secondary mezzo soprano roles onstage with numerous opera luminaries. In 1965, under the leadership of general director Carol Fox, she became artistic administrator, a position she held until the Board appointed her general director after Fox's dismissal in 1981. She served as general director from 1982 until her death in 1997. She was appointed a member of the National Endowment for the Arts and also served as chairman of Opera America in the mid-1990s.Lyric History (Lyric Opera of Chicago) Under Krainik's leadership, the Lyric Opera was able to put its fiscal house in order after many years of running in the red. In 1991 she made headlines when she fired Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti for yet another cancellation due to his being \\"indisposed.\\" Krainik endeared herself to Chicago's opera patrons, who had been disappointed by one too many of Pavarotti's last-minute cancellations. At a 1996 Gala celebrating Krainik's 43-year career at the Lyric, the 3,563-seat Art Deco house was renamed the Ardis Krainik Theatre in honor of her lifetime of contributions to the Lyric Opera, including a $110 million renovation of the second largest opera auditorium in North America (after New York's Metropolitan Opera) in 1993. The Gala, hosted by Pl√°cido Domingo, did not include Mr. Pavarotti, who had not been invited. In 1996, she received the Chicago History Museum \\"Making History Award\\" for Distinction in the Performing Arts.

It has just under 4800 inhabitants.  History and background  Appelscha is a village of about 490 hectares in size of which 8 hectares consists of water, it was first named in written documents in 1247 as Appels which is the translation of apples. The last part of the name Appelscha has its origin due to the woods around the village. ‚ÄòSche‚Äô or ‚Äòscha‚Äô means woods and was therefore added to the name of the village. It consisted from a few farms surrounding the Boerestreek (what was called high-Appelscha) for centuries, the hamlets Aakinga, Terwisscha and De Built close by. Appelscha remained a small village, tucked away between sand dunes and wet peat. In 2007, Oude Willem, a small natural area in between Appelscha and Zorgvlied was even chosen as \\"most beautiful place in the Netherlands\\" by readers of HP/De Tijd which is a magazine in the Netherlands.  Sand and Peat  Around 1450 dikes were constructed to ensure the acid leakwater from the peat returned to the fields. The old Appelscha suffered much of drifting sand from the dunes. In 1881 people therefore started with the construction of the forest. After 1827 the village extends with the advent of thousands Frisian workers for peat extraction, and the modern village was created. The Social conditions were however, very poor. By the time peat yielded much less than coal, a huge strike broke out (1888). Because of this large immigration of Frisian workers in the nineteenth century, Appelscha became a Frisian-speaking village, in a municipality where otherwise Stellingwarfs was spoken, a dialect of Dutch.  Sanatorium Beatrixoord  In 1922, the Friesch Volkssanatorium from Joure transferred to Appelscha. Many thousands of patients spent years in the huge forest to try to cure their tuberculosis. Today only the X-ray department of the Sanatorium is left. This is the only tuberculosis museum in the world.  Surroundings and tourism  Appelscha is located at the northern edge of the 61-square-kilometre Drents-Friese Wold National Park, which is one of the biggest nature reserves in the Netherlands, located on the boundary of the provinces Friesland and Drenthe. The forest and the sand dunes around the village attract tourists to Appelscha, and have become known in the Netherlands for their natural environment. There are restaurants and weekend markets during the summer in the Boerestreek, which used to be the tourist center of the village. Many other attractions at the Boerestreek also attracted tourists in the past, including an amusement park ‚ÄòDuinenzathe‚Äô and a miniature park. The amusement park moved to the edge of the village in 1997 after the municipality planned to redevelop the Boerestreek. The miniature park closed in October 2002 after decreasing numbers of visitors following the redevelopment. Due to its history as a peat producing village, Appelscha is located along the Opsterlandse Compagnonsvaart, the canal that flows through the village and connects it to surrounding villages. Nowadays this canal is a popular tourist route for boaters, attracting a large number of visitors to Appelscha every year. In 2012, 11 per cent of short domestic holidays, and 13 per cent of long domestic holidays by the Dutch people were spent in the area on the Groningse, Friese, and Drentse sand dunes, of which Appelscha is part (CBS, tourism and recreation in 2012). As well as boating, Appelscha has a couple of campgrounds, of which RCN De Roggeberg is the largest. Customers of this campground in the summer month have free use of the ‚ÄòBosbad Appelscha‚Äô, a large open-air swimming pool next to the campground, surrounded by the woods. Since 2007 the village has had a nine-hole golf course with 1,944 metres of fairways at the Golf Resort De Hildenberg. The resort also has 129 villas for rent, which are near the Bosbad Appelscha. For more adventurous visitors, Appelscha has an adventure park called ‚ÄòKlimbos Appelscha‚Äô. At this park in a forest near the Boerestreek, there are climbing trails from tree to tree at heights from four to 14 meters (13 to 45 feet). Starting from the central platform adventurers are able to choose from trails requiring different skill levels.  WWII  In the last days of World War Two, the area was the site of a sharp battle between German forces and the Free French, combined with the Canadian forces.  Community  Appelscha‚Äôs inhabitants consists about 50% men and 50% women. The largest group representing 32% of the population is in the age of 45‚Äì64. The smallest age group is in the age of 15‚Äì24 years which makes its population age quite old on average. 47% of its inhabitants are married while only 7% is divorced. Another 7% is widowed.

The Court unanimously found that the companies that sold Syncrude faulty gear boxes were not liable for their poor design, however, the Court was divided on the test to determine when a fundamental breach could void a contract. The Court held that the limitation of liability clause was enforceable even in the case of a fundamental breach so long as it was clear in the language that it was within the intentions of the parties. Background Syncrude contracted with Hunter Engineering and Allis-Chalmers to design gear boxes. Due to design flaws, the boxes were not usable for their intended purpose. Syncrude spent over $1 million to repair the boxes. Hunter sought protection under a limitation of liability clause within the contract. Judgment of the Court There were three separate reasons given. Chief Justice Dickson, with La Forest J., found that the limitation clause was valid. He argued that the doctrine of fundamental breach is not appropriate. Instead, the issue should only be dealt with as a matter of contractual unconscionability such as where parties have unequal bargaining power. Justice Wilson, with Justice L'Heureux-Dube, argued that the limitation clause could be invalidated in certain circumstances. Wilson proposed that a contract could be struck out for fundamental breach where the conduct of one party deprives the other party of \\"substantially the whole benefit\\" of the contract. Justice McIntyre, writing briefly for himself alone, agreed with Wilson on a number of findings based on the facts, but refused to deal with the issue of fundamental breach.

It is in geographic South Himsworth Township; is located on Ontario Highway 11, south of the town centre of Powassan; and is part of the Almaguin Highlands. Etymology Situated on a tributary of the South River, in Parry Sound District, south of North Bay, this town (1913) was first known as Little Bend of the South River and Powassan as the Big Bend. It was called Melbourne after the pioneer settlers arrived in 1868, possibly for Melbourne, Australia, itself named in 1835 for Lord Melbourne (1779‚Äì1848), the British prime minister in 1834-41. However, its post office was called Barkerton in 1887. Three years later it was renamed Trout Creek. Transportation The Canadian National Railway transcontinental main line was the first transportation link that was constructed in the area during the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, the Ferguson Road, later becoming Ontario Highway 11 was constructed on a roughly parallel course to the rail line. Ontario Highway 11 was rerouted around the community in 2002 following its expansion to a four- lane divided highway, with Ontario Highway 522 assuming its former alignment south out of the community reaching its terminus at McFadden Line and Interchange 301, and the former northern alignment became Ontario Highway 522B reaching its terminus at Hemlock Road and Interchange 306.

Regulated functions arise as a class of integrable functions, and have several equivalent characterisations. Regulated functions were introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki in 1949, in their book \\"Livre IV: Fonctions d'une variable r√©elle\\". Definition Let X be a Banach space with norm  - X. A function f : [0, T] ‚Üí X is said to be a regulated function if one (and hence both) of the following two equivalent conditions holds true: * for every t in the interval [0, T], both the left and right limits f(t‚àí) and f(t+) exist in X (apart from, obviously, f(0‚àí) and f(T+)); * there exists a sequence of step functions œÜn : [0, T] ‚Üí X converging uniformly to f (i.e. with respect to the supremum norm  - ‚àû). It requires a little work to show that these two conditions are equivalent. However, it is relatively easy to see that the second condition may be re-stated in the following equivalent ways: * for every Œ¥ > 0, there is some step function œÜŒ¥ : [0, T] ‚Üí X such that ::\\\\ f - \\\\varphi_\\\\delta \\\\_\\\\infty = \\\\sup_{t \\\\in [0, T]} \\\\ f(t) - \\\\varphi_\\\\delta (t) \\\\_X < \\\\delta; * f lies in the closure of the space Step([0, T]; X) of all step functions from [0, T] into X (taking closure with respect to the supremum norm in the space B([0, T]; X) of all bounded functions from [0, T] into X). Properties of regulated functions Let Reg([0, T]; X) denote the set of all regulated functions f : [0, T] ‚Üí X. * Sums and scalar multiples of regulated functions are again regulated functions. In other words, Reg([0, T]; X) is a vector space over the same field K as the space X; typically, K will be the real or complex numbers. If X is equipped with an operation of multiplication, then products of regulated functions are again regulated functions. In other words, if X is a K-algebra, then so is Reg([0, T]; X). * The supremum norm is a norm on Reg([0, T]; X), and Reg([0, T]; X) is a topological vector space with respect to the topology induced by the supremum norm. * As noted above, Reg([0, T]; X) is the closure in B([0, T]; X) of Step([0, T]; X) with respect to the supremum norm. * If X is a Banach space, then Reg([0, T]; X) is also a Banach space with respect to the supremum norm. * Reg([0, T]; R) forms an infinite-dimensional real Banach algebra: finite linear combinations and products of regulated functions are again regulated functions. * Since a continuous function defined on a compact space (such as [0, T]) is automatically uniformly continuous, every continuous function f : [0, T] ‚Üí X is also regulated. In fact, with respect to the supremum norm, the space C0([0, T]; X) of continuous functions is a closed linear subspace of Reg([0, T]; X). * If X is a Banach space, then the space BV([0, T]; X) of functions of bounded variation forms a dense linear subspace of Reg([0, T]; X): ::\\\\mathrm{Reg}([0, T]; X) = \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{BV} ([0, T]; X)} \\\\mbox{ w.r.t. } \\\\ \\\\cdot \\\\_{\\\\infty}. * If X is a Banach space, then a function f : [0, T] ‚Üí X is regulated if and only if it is of bounded œÜ-variation for some œÜ: ::\\\\mathrm{Reg}([0, T]; X) = \\\\bigcup_{\\\\varphi} \\\\mathrm{BV}_{\\\\varphi} ([0, T]; X). * If X is a separable Hilbert space, then Reg([0, T]; X) satisfies a compactness theorem known as the Fra≈àkov√°‚ÄìHelly selection theorem. * The set of discontinuities of a regulated function of bounded variation BV is countable for such functions have only jump-type of discontinuities. To see this it is sufficient to note that given \\\\epsilon > 0 , the set of points at which the right and left limits differ by more than \\\\epsilon is finite. In particular, the discontinuity set has measure zero, from which it follows that a regulated function has a well-defined Riemann integral. * Remark: By the Baire Category theorem the set of points of discontinuity of such function F_\\\\sigma is either meager or else has nonempty interior. This is not always equivalent with countability.Stackexchange discussion * The integral, as defined on step functions in the obvious way, extends naturally to Reg([0, T]; X) by defining the integral of a regulated function to be the limit of the integrals of any sequence of step functions converging uniformly to it. This extension is well-defined and satisfies all of the usual properties of an integral. In particular, the regulated integral ** is a bounded linear function from Reg([0, T]; X) to X; hence, in the case X = R, the integral is an element of the space that is dual to Reg([0, T]; R); ** agrees with the Riemann integral.

The plot follows Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) whose stay at a vacation home is disrupted by three masked criminals who infiltrate the home. The screenplay was inspired by two real- life events: the Manson family Tate murders, a multiple homicide, as well as a series of break-ins that occurred in Bertino's neighborhood as a child. Some journalists noted similarities between the film and the Keddie cabin murders that occurred in Keddie, California in 1981, though Bertino did not cite this as a reference. Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006. Originally slated for a theatrical release in November 2007, it was postponed before a theatrical release on May 30, 2008. It grossed $82 million at the box office worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars have interpreted it as a criticism of the perceived safety of pastoral life, as well as an exploration of stranger-on-stranger violence. A sequel, titled The Strangers: Prey at Night, was released on March 9, 2018. Plot In a secluded area, away from civilization, James Hoyt and Kristen McKay arrive at night to James' childhood summer home, returning from a friend's wedding. Tension abounds between the couple, as Kristen rejected James's marriage proposal to her after the reception. James calls his friend Mike and asks him to pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4:00 a.m., there is a loud knock at the door. A young blonde woman, whose face is obstructed by poor lighting, asks the couple \\"Is Tamara home?\\" but is turned away by James. James goes for a drive to purchase a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. Kristen returns to the kitchen, where, unbeknownst to her, a man‚Äîthe Man in the Mask‚Äîwatches her from an adjacent hallway. Kristen notices the smoke alarm she left on the floor is now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. Upon going to retrieve her cell phone from the charger, she finds it is missing, and begins to panic. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find the Man in the Mask, staring at her. Screaming, she stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door is forced ajar. When she goes to push the door closed, the blonde woman, now in a doll mask‚ÄîDollface‚Äîpeeks inside. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears the strangers outside bashing the walls of the house. The noise eventually stops and James returns to the home. After she explains what has happened, he goes outside to the car to obtain his phone, whereupon he finds the car ransacked and vandalized, and sees Dollface watching him from afar. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but another woman in a pin-up girl mask‚ÄîPin-Up Girl‚Äîrear- ends them with a truck, forcing them to flee. Back inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun and wait for the intruders in a bedroom. Mike arrives and realizes something is wrong after seeing James's wrecked car. He enters the house, and James, mistaking him for one of the intruders, shoots him dead. Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves and encounters Pin-Up Girl, searching the backyard with a flashlight. When James tries to shoot her, the Man in the Mask knocks him unconscious, inadvertently discharging the gun. Kristen hears the shot and runs to the shed. She finds the radio, but Pin-Up Girl smashes it with an ax. Kristen rushes back to the house where she encounters Dollface, who taunts her with a knife, saying, \\"You're gonna die.\\" She tries to escape but is incapacitated by the Man in the Mask. At dawn, the couple awaken to find themselves tied to chairs in the living room with the strangers standing before them. Kristen demands, \\"Why are you doing this?\\" to which Dollface replies, \\"Because you were home.\\" The strangers unmask themselves to Kristen and James before taking turns stabbing them in the chest and abdomen. After, the strangers drive away in their truck, and come across two young boys on bicycles distributing religious tracts. Dollface comes out of the truck and asks if she can have one of their tract cards. One of the boys asks her, \\"Are you a sinner?\\" to which Dollface responds saying, \\"Sometimes.\\" The boy gives her one, and the strangers drive away as Pin-Up Girl states, \\"It'll be easier next time.\\" The two boys come upon the house and discover the chaotic scene with a ransacked house, and the bloodied bodies of Kristen, James, and Mike inside. One of the boys approaches Kristen's body and attempts to touch it. As he reaches out to her, Kristen, still alive, startles him by grabbing his hand and screaming. Cast * Liv Tyler as Kristen McKay * Scott Speedman as James Hoyt * Gemma Ward as Dollface * Kip Weeks as the Man in the Mask * Laura Margolis as Pin-Up Girl * Glenn Howerton as Mike * Alex Fisher and Peter Clayton-Luce as Mormon boys * Patrick Stewart and Laurence Fishburne as Narrator Themes Film scholar Kevin Wetmore noted the film's portrayal of violence as a reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: \\"Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror‚Äîthe result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the clich√© goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); [here], death is random and unrelated to one's behavior.\\" In The Horror Show Guide: The Ultimate Frightfest of Movies, Mike Mayo noted the film's \\"grim realism,\\" writing that the main characters \\"could have wandered out of a gloomy Ingmar Bergman film,\\" ultimately branding the film as an example of \\"naturalistic domestic horror\\" akin to Michael Haneke's Funny Games. The film has also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as highlighting \\"the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes,\\" as well as for its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: \\"The Strangers, as many horror films do ... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth.\\" In his book Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film (2014), scholar Tony Williams notes the film's setting within a 1970s-era home as representative of an \\"American tradition of violence that is random and without any coherent explanation.\\" Additionally, Williams reads the three masked assailants as metaphors for the \\"repressed and unresolved tensions affecting the couple inside the house.\\" Production =Screenplay and inspiration= Writer-director Bryan Bertino wrote the screenplay which was originally titled The Faces; it was the third screenplay he had ever written. Bertino had a particular interest in the horror genre, noting how one can connect to an audience by scaring them, and would state in subsequent interviews that he grew up watching horror films. In particular, he stated he was significantly inspired by thriller films of the 1970s while writing the screenplay, and envisioned a film that \\"put the audience in the world of the victims.\\" According to production notes and subsequent interviews, the film was inspired by true events from Bertino's childhood: Bertino explains: In interviews, Bertino stated he was \\"very impressed\\" with some of the theories circulating on the Internet about the \\"true events\\" the movie is allegedly based on, but said that his main inspiration was the true crime book Helter Skelter, which is about the Manson Family murders; some journalists speculated that the film was also inspired by the unsolved Keddie Cabin Murders of 1981 that occurred in a small vacation community in California's Sierra Nevada. The film's premise has been compared by some film critics to the French horror film Them, released two years earlier, which also features a couple terrorized by strangers in their remote home. Bertino entered the screenplay for The Strangers into a screenwriting contest, after which he sold its directorial rights to Universal Pictures. =Casting= When casting the two leading actors in the film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler for the role of Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, accepted the part after being impressed by the script, which she read while on a flight from Japan to Los Angeles: \\"I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate‚Äîwith questions lingering. I knew it would be interesting to act that.\\" Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that \\"the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages\\". In casting the three masked intruders, Bertino chose Australian fashion model Gemma Ward for the part of Dollface, feeling she had the exact \\"look\\" he had imagined; Ward was officially cast in the film in September 2006. In preparing for the role, Ward read Vincent Bugioisi's Helter Skelter for inspiration. Kip Weeks was then chosen as the Man in the Mask, and television actress Laura Margolis, who found the script to be a real \\"page turner\\", was cast in the part of Pin-Up Girl. In retrospect, Bertino said he chose the three actors based on their abilities to convey their characters in spite of the fact that their faces remain unseen onscreen. =Filming= Mark Romanek (pictured) was originally attached to direct the project but after he backed out, Bertino took over. Bertino had not initially planned on directing The Strangers, and had been disconnected from the project after selling directorial rights to Universal Pictures. Both Justin Lin and Mark Romanek were attached to direct, but eventually backed out. Approximately two years after Bertino had sold the screenplay, Universal passed the project onto its subsidiary, Rogue Pictures, who approached Bertino to direct the project, despite his lack of experience. On a $9 million budget, filming for The Strangers began on October 10, 2006, and finished in early 2007. It was shot on location roughly 10 miles outside of Florence, South Carolina, and the house interior was constructed by a set crew. Though the film takes place in 2005, the house itself was deliberately constructed with an architecture reminiscent of 1970s ranch houses and dressed in furnishings applicable to the era. Bertino based the house on the types of homes common where he had grown up in rural Texas. The property was located on the outskirts of Timmonsville, South Carolina. Despite weather complications, the film was largely shot in chronological order. During production, it was reported that Liv Tyler came down with tonsillitis due to the extensive screaming the role required her to do. Alternate link at Cinema Review. Tyler would later recall it being the most difficult film she had ever worked on, \\"both physically and emotionally.\\" According to Laura Margolis, who played the Pin-Up Girl, Tyler also specifically requested that she not see her mask prior to filming: \\"I got strict instructions not to let Liv see me in my mask before we shot,\\" Margolis recalled. \\"The first scene that I shot was stalking [her] outside of the barn. I had been told that she really wanted to be scared. She didn't want to have to fake it, and so it was my responsibility to really scare her. So we shot that scene, I ran at her, she started actually screaming, and then she kicked me away.\\" The masks featured in the film were chosen by Bertino, who wanted them to appear as though the killers \\"could have picked them up at any store.\\" =Post-production= Film editor Kevin Greutert was hired to edit the film; at the time, he recently finished editing Saw III. Several changes were made to the film during post-production, primarily regarding the conclusion: In the screenplay and the original footage shot, the three masked strangers reveal their faces on camera. After the sequence in which Kristen and James are stabbed, the strangers wander around the house, cleaning up parts of the crime scene before dressing into Kristen and James's clothes. Following test screenings, it was decided by the producers that the strangers' faces should remain unseen to the audience, which required the sequences following the stabbing to be excised. Music A musical score, consisting of 19 pieces composed by score producer tomandandy, was released on May 27, 2008, and was distributed by Lakeshore Records. The album was received with generally positive reviews by critics. \\"It's a creepy score for what appears to be a movie that will make you jump as well as make sure that the doors are locked at night,\\" writes reviewer Jeff Swindoll. \\"This is an impressive score and adds a tremendous chill-factor to the film,\\" says Zach Freeman of Blogger News, grading it with an A. =Track listing= ;Songs from Film, but not on Soundtrack # \\"Ariel Ramirez\\" - Richard Buckner # \\"Hopeful\\" - Jennifer O'Connor # \\"At My Window Sad and Lonely\\" - Billy Bragg and Wilco # \\"Sprout and the Bean\\" - Joanna Newsom # \\"My First Lover\\" - Gillian Welch # \\"Mama Tried\\" - Merle Haggard Release The producers originally planned for a summer release in July 2007, which was eventually postponed to November 2007; however, this date was postponed as well. The producers instead opted for a summer release, and The Strangers had its theatrical debut in United States and Canada on May 30, 2008. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $21 million in 2,467 theaters, ranking #3 at the box office and averaging $8,514 per theater. The overall box office return was successful, earning $82.4 million worldwide. =Marketing and promotion= Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler promoting the film at the 2007 San Diego Comic Con In late July 2007, Bertino, Tyler and Speedman attended San Diego's annual Comic-Con event to promote the film; all three were present for a questions-and-answers panel session, as well as a screening of the film's official teaser trailer; this trailer was released on the internet several weeks later. It was not until March 2008 that a full-length trailer for the film was released, which can be found on Apple's QuickTime trailer gallery. The trailer originally began running in theaters attached to Rogue Pictures' sci-fi film Doomsday in March 2008, and television advertisements began airing on networks in early-mid April 2008 to promote the film's May release. Two one-sheet posters for the film were released in August 2007, one showing the three masked Strangers, and the other displaying a wounded Liv Tyler. In April 2008, roughly two months before the film's official theatrical debut, the final, official one-sheet for the film was released, featuring Liv Tyler standing in a darkened kitchen with a masked man looming behind her in the shadows. =Home media= The Strangers was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on October 21, 2008. Both the Blu-ray and DVD feature rated and unrated versions of the film, with the unrated edition running approximately two minutes longer. Bonus materials include two deleted scenes and a making-of featurette. The DVD was released in the UK on December 26, 2008. The film was available on Universal VOD (Video on Demand) from November 19, 2008, through March 31, 2009.Universal ‚Äì VOD: The Strangers ‚Äì November 19, 2008. In commemoration of the film's 10th anniversary, a two-disc collector's edition Blu-ray by Scream Factory was released on March 6, 2018, featuring a 2K video transfer, as well as a combination of new and archival cast and crew interviews. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48%, based on 164 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"The Strangers has a handful of genuinely scary moments, but they're not enough to elevate the end results above standard slasher fare.\\" Metacritic reported an average score of 47 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Unfavorable reviews included Roger Ebert's of the Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, saying: \\"The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story.\\" Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was \\"A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick.\\" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that \\"No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation.\\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy ‚Äì a \\"comparison which does 'Strangers' no favors. 'Vacancy' director Nimr√≥d Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive.\\" Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post panned the film, calling it \\"a fraud from start to finish.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film \\"uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile,\\" but admitted that \\"it does it well, with more than usual skill.\\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, \\"Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under our skin with a pile driver.\\" Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger opined of the film, \\"Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody.\\" Among the positive reviews, Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said The Strangers is \\"suspenseful,\\" \\"highly effective,\\" and \\"smartly maintain[s] its commitment to tingling creepiness over bludgeoning horror.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"creepily atmospheric psychological thriller with a death grip on the psychological aspect.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that, \\"This is one of those rare horror movies that concentrates on suspense and terror rather than on gore and a high body count.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club said that \\"as an exercise in controlled mayhem, horror movies don't get much scarier.\\" Additional positive feedback for the film came from Joblo.com reviewer Berge Garabedian, who praised director Bertino for \\"building the tension nicely, with lots of silences, creepy voices, jump scares, use of songs and a sharp eye behind the camera, as well as plenty of Steadicam give it all more of a voyeuristic feel.\\" Empire Magazine remarked on the film's retro-style, saying, \\"Like much recent horror, from the homages of the Grindhouse gang through flat multiplex remakes of drive-in classics, The Strangers looks to the '70s.\\", and ultimately branded the film as \\"an effective, scary emotional work-out.\\" Slant Magazines Nick Schager listed The Strangers as the 9th best film of 2008. In 2009, the film was ranked #13 on \\"Bravo's 13 Scarier Movie Moments\\" television piece, and in a 2018 retrospective, Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly deemed the film a \\"modern-day slasher classic.\\" The A.V. Club named it the 23rd best horror film made since 2000. Sequel In August 2008, Rogue Pictures confirmed that a sequel was in the works, with Brian Bertino co- writing the screenplay with Ben Ketai. The project was originally slated to enter principal photography in 2009, during which time it was tentatively titled The Strangers: Part II. Directors Laurent Briet and Marcel Langenegger were considered to direct, but landed eventually to Johannes Roberts. After a troubled development period, filming on the sequel began May 30, 2017. Later titled The Strangers: Prey at Night, the film was released on March 9, 2018.

The entrance tower to the house and the lower courtyard are from the late 15th or early 16th century. It was built by Burkhard Berger, a vassal of the bishop of Strasbourg. The castle's position allowed surveillance of the old Roman road running from Mont Sainte-Odile to Champ du Feu and the valley of the Bruche. The castle belonged the Berger family until 1532, then to the Mundolsheim family until the French Revolution. The castle fell into ruins after the Thirty Years' War and was taken over by the town of Obernai, becoming part of the continuous forest between Obernai and Bernardswiller.

Early in the 90s this interaction between parents, children and members of the Buddhist monastery inspired a group of parents to meet in Brighton with the aim of opening the first Buddhist School for children in the U.K. Dharma Primary School was founded by a group of parents in 1994, after two years of fund-raising.

On this day the school received blessings from founder patron, Luang Por Sumedho, a Buddhist monk and teacher, and blessings were also sent from the Dalai Lama, who later became a patron of the school. This was the first full-time school in Great Britain based on the Buddhist faith.Robert Bluck, British Buddhism: teachings, practice and development (2006), p. 23: \\"Turning to education, the Dharma School opened in Brighton in 1994 as the first full-time Buddhist school in Britain (Medhina, 1994: 209). While its origins were Forest Sangha family camps...\\" By 2000 the co- educational school was teaching children between the ages of three and eleven. By 2005 the number of pupils stood at seventy, with almost equal numbers of boys and girls.The Independent Schools Guide (2006), p. 205 With the support of patrons including Noy Thomson (M.R.Saisvadi Svasti) and Peter Carey, Buddhists and founder trustees, the school moved to The White House, Patcham, in June 1995 with eleven children. A nursery and reception class and three mixed-age primary classes were later established.

A. (2010). Mindfulness-Based approaches with children and adolescents: A preliminary review of current research in an emergent field.<19(2), 133-144. Engaging young children with mindfulness requires an experienced approach that takes into account their shorter attention spans and emotional development.[Sussex, August issue 2012, pg 77 Dharma Primary School integrates mindfulness, as a deeper Buddhist ethos, for very young children. The practice may be of benefit to children during their primary school years when the brain‚Äôs limbic system (that controls emotion and behaviour) is still developing; scientific research has shown that core life skills, emotional literacy and personality traits formed during this crucial period help determine how we will function as adults., Our personalities maybe set as early as first grade, 8 June 2010 The school integrates short sessions of silent or guided meditation several times a week for young children and connects mindfulness with regular daily activities such as eating, working and playing as a way to develop patience, compassion and self-awareness. In daily meditation the older children are given a range of opportunities to reflect on and discuss experiences that have affected their inner world. On Fridays parents are invited to the school puja, during which there is usually quiet time for meditation, after which the children perform or show some work, or a story is told. As well as mindfulness and meditation, yoga is taught to children, alongside mainstream lessons.

The camp has been in use by the Nebraska National Guard for more than 100 years. The camp is currently home to the 209th Regimental Training Institute.https://ne.ng.mil/RTI Year-round training is conducted at Camp Ashland, and it is considered one of the midwest's most important military training centers, with 80,000 to 100,000 service members training at the camp every year. Each weekend can see anywhere from 300 to 1,000 troops at the camp, above and beyond the service members attending schools there.https://www.omaha.com/news/military/seven-months- after-flooding-washed-over-camp-national-guard- training/article_713805d3-a237-5d54-8f65-6a2167c192e9.html Early history The camp was first established in 1906 after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. It was used as a rifle range, in order for Nebraska Soldiers to improve their marksmanship through target practice. At the time, the owner of the land rented part of her farm to the state of Nebraska for $994.05. The state constructed ranges and conducted \\"encampments\\" (now known as annual training) at the site and renewed the lease option. The Federal government purchased the land in 1916.https://ne.ng.mil/Resource/BTG/48_2015_0405.pdf When Nebraska National Guard troops returned home from World War I in 1919, the site of the camp had fallen into disrepair. Repairs were conducted using Federal funds, and in 1923, annual training once again occurred at Camp Ashland. During this time frame, the camp developed rapidly. An administration building was constructed, along with a wooden boxing ring. In 1930, Memorial Hall was dedicated, and served as the Camp's primary administration building for decades (currently known as Building 50). During the 1930s the boxing ring was rebuilt by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) into a concrete arena with a 3,000 person capacity. Eventually, the firing-range operations were moved to a location 130 miles southwest, currently known as Greenlief Training Site, near Hastings, Nebraska.https://ne.ng.mil/Resource/BTG/48_2015_0405.pdf Current use The camp is home to the 209th Regimental Training Institute (RTI), which consists of Headquarters (HQ), 209th RTI, 1/209th RTI (NCO Academy), 2/209th RTI (OCS/WOCS), 3/209th RTI (88M), and Camp Ashland Training Site Command (CATS). Access to the camp is restricted to the public and only authorized personnel and those with United States Department of Defense (DOD) identification are allowed to enter. Camp Ashland has remained a primary training site for the Nebraska National Guard throughout its history, and has also been used by other branches of the active United States military, other state National Guard units, and for military joint force training exercises with units from other countries. The camp has been used by many other groups, such as the Civil Air Patrol, JROTC, and Boy Scouts. =HQ 209th RTI= Headquarters (HQ) 209th RTI's mission is to provide leadership and support for the subordinate battalions of the 209th RTI, and also for the Camp Ashland Training Site Command (CATS). =1/209th RTI= 1st Battalion's mission as an NCO Academy is to facilitate soldiers' training needs by providing tactical and technical training. The current primary course for 1st BN is the Basic Leader Course (BLC), which is taught at the 209th RTI to active duty U.S. Army Soldiers, Army National Guard Soldiers, and Army Reserve Soldiers. The course is currently a 22-day course. Unlike the active component, the course is taught straight through with no days off. Training focuses on leadership and war-fighting techniques, to prepare junior non-commissioned officers (NCO) for duty. The BLC course was formerly known as Warrior Leader Course (WLC), and prior to that was called Primary Leadership Development Course (PLDC). =2/209th RTI= 2nd Battalion's mission is to conduct the Officer Candidate School (OCS) and Warrant officer (United States) Candidate School (WOCS). The course teaches a variety of leadership skills and small-unit tactics. Traditional training takes place on the weekend for 16‚Äì18 months, plus two two-week periods. Accelerated training is an 8-week course. Students are referred to as \\"Candidates\\" during their training, and must successfully complete a rigorous training regimen to test them both physically and mentally, in order to receive a formal commission. OCS and WOCS graduates go on to become leaders as officers in the United States military. =3/209th RTI= 3rd Battalion's mission is the operation of the Medium Transportation Military Occupational Specialty (88M United States military occupation code (MOS)) course as set forth by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia. This course is provided to members of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve who are reclassifying to the 88M MOS. The 88M course consists of two phases, each two weeks in length, and generally taught consecutively for 28 days. During Phase I, students are taught to operate of M1083 Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton trucks, and M915 tractor trucks with M872 trailers. During Phase II, the students are taught to operate the M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System (LHS) trucks, along with the M1076 PLS trailer. The 88M MOS course has been taught at Camp Ashland since 2008. =CATS= Camp Ashland Training Site Command (CATS) covers both Camp Ashland and Greenlief Training site, provides lodging and logistical support for both sites, along with facilitating scheduling for training events at the two sites. CATS also facilitates semi-private, cabin, recreational-vehicle, and campground lodging for current and former military and DOD members.https://www.militarycampgrounds.us/nebraska/camp-ashland-campground 2019 flooding Camp Ashland is located on a flood plain by virtue of its proximity to the Platte River. Due to previous flood issues, the military has steadily increased the camp's flood protection over the years, from a five foot high protective berm/levee, to 3 foot high flood-control barrier doors following a 2015 flood that caused $3.7 million in damage.https://www.omaha.com/news/military/seven-months-after-flooding-washed- over-camp-national-guard- training/article_713805d3-a237-5d54-8f65-6a2167c192e9.html In March 2019, however, historic flooding ravaged Camp Ashland, causing unprecedented damage. On March 14, 2019, the Salt Creek (Platte River) flooded from the southeast side of the camp, sweeping through with mud and debris. Salt Creek itself crested at 22.11 feet depth.https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=oax&gage;=astn1&prob;_type=stage&source;=hydrograph Then, two days later, the Platte River itself broke through the protective levee on the east and northeast side, bringing an even larger flood of water along with debris, sand, and mud across the camp. In all, 51 of the 62 buildings in the camp were heavily damaged or destroyed. It was the worst disaster in the camp's 100-year history, with water cresting along the camp anywhere from 5 to 7 feet (well above the flood-control doors), forcing extensive repairs to nearly every area of the camp. Any scheduled training that could still be conducted was moved to alternate locations, with many training events being cancelled. The only buildings on camp to escape significant damage were those built on stilts in 1997. Currently, Nebraska military representatives would like to expand that plan to so that any replacement buildings would also be raised on stilts.https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/flood-repairs- at-nebraska-national-guard-s-camp-ashland- may/article_bc9c4eb4-538f-59e6-936b-2c67f52b7ad2.htmlhttps://www.omaha.com/news/military/floodwaters- leave-national-guard-s-top-training-camp-a- wasteland/article_129e7fc4-2aa6-5f88-b2b7-96ce256e139a.html 2020 coronavirus quarantine In late January, 2020, during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, China, the Chinese government halted nearly all transit to and from the city.
