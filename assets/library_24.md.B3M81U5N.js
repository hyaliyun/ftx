It is within the San Fernando Pastoral Region of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Originally known as the Indians, the school later changed their mascot to the Warriors. History Founded in 1947 as a school for girls, the school was originally named St. Ferdinand High School. In 1956, boys were admitted for the first time and the school was renamed to Bishop Alemany High School after Joseph Sadoc Alemany, the first archbishop of San Francisco. It was co- instructional, with separate divisions for girls and boys, until 1970 when it became coeducational. Alemany used to be located on the north side of Rinaldi St, just east of Sepulveda Blvd, but the Northridge earthquake in 1994 forced the school to move across the street into the nearby buildings of Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary at the historic San Fernando Mission. The high school shared the campus with the seminarians for one year. The seminary closed in 1995. The 1971 Sylmar earthquake did considerable damage to Alemany's campus, as well.

He was an eight-time Champion Jockey (including one title shared with John Francome), riding 1,678 winning horses in his career. He received an MBE for his services to the sport of horse racing. Early life Scudamore was born in June 1958 to jockey Michael Scudamore and his wife Mary. Michael Scudamore won the 1959 Grand National on Oxo, when his son was still a baby. Scudamore remembers little about his father's career, except for the fall that ended it. He has, however, spoken of his father's toughness as a jockey and of wanting to live up to him. Racing career Scudamore's first competitive ride came in 1978, the start of a 15-year career which would see him break many jumps racing records. He benefited particularly from being a stable jockey for the record breaking trainer Martin Pipe and the partnership was an extremely successful one throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. As well as setting the then all-time career record of 1,678 winners, he also set the record for most winners in a season (221) in 1988-89, surpassing Jonjo O'Neill's mark to become the first jockey to exceed 150 in one season. Although both records have since been surpassed, Scudamore's records were set before the advent of year-round National Hunt racing. In all, he was champion eight times. He won 13 times at the Cheltenham Festival including two Champion Hurdles - Celtic Shot in 1988 and Granville Again in 1993 - and a Queen Mother Champion Chase on Pearlyman. Other major victories included the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup (twice), Mackeson Gold Cup, four Welsh Nationals (including two on Bonanza Boy) and two Scottish Nationals. Horses with which he was associated during his racing career included Grand National winners Miinnehoma and Little Polveir although he himself won neither a National nor a Cheltenham Gold Cup nor a King George. He retired on 7 April 1993 with a winning ride on Sweet Duke at Ascot, his 1,678th winner. Post-retirement Immediately after retirement, Scudamore became an assistant trainer to his business partner Nigel Twiston-Davies. He now lives with, and is assistant trainer to, Scottish jumps trainer, Lucinda Russell at Arlary House Stables near Milnathort. He has also pursued a career in media, featuring regularly as a pundit on BBC racing coverage and writing a racing column for the Daily Mail. He is involved with his son Michael’s yard in Herefordshire and his other son Tom Scudamore is also now a professional jockey. Peter is second cousin to former Chief Executive of the F.A.

They are part of the Chinese diaspora. Chinese people first arrived in Nicaragua's Caribbean coast in the latter part of the 19th century and most of them settled in cities such as Bluefields, El Bluff, Laguna de Perlas and Puerto Cabezas. The Chinese immigrants dominated the commerce of the main coastal towns on the Caribbean coast prior to 1879. Then in the late 19th century, they began migrating to the Pacific lowlands of the country. History The Chinese were thought to have arrived in Nicaragua in the late 19th century, the majority of which came from China's Guǎngdōng (广东) province.www.bvsde.org.ni Los Chinos, ¶-2 This supposition remained unsubstantiated until the second census (in 1920) revealed that 400 citizens of Chinese nationality lived in Nicaragua. According to documents, the population of Puerto Cabezas in the R.A.A.N. department was formed not only by the Miskitos, but by communities of Jamaicans, Germans and also Chinese in 1925. Also, the community of Chinese immigrants in Bluefields was thought to be the largest in Central America. The first Chinese consul came to Nicaragua in 1930. Many Chinese in Nicaragua committed themselves to the commerce industry and opened businesses. They also dedicated themselves to the candy, soap, and clothing industries. They dominated the commerce of the main coastal towns on the Caribbean coast prior to 1979. Immigration A California Gold Rush handbill listing Nicaragua as a shortcut Although information about when the Chinese first arrived in Nicaragua is scarce, Fernando Centeno Chiong, a Nicaraguan historian, journalist and university professor of Chinese descent, published an article in La Prensa about the presence of the Chinese. Chiong wrote that there are some references that exist stating that the Chinese first arrived in Nicaragua in the mid-19th century, most notably during the California Gold Rush, in which people from all over the world traveled to California to mine for gold, tens of thousands of whom travelled by steamboats operated by the Accessory Transit Company, whose director was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt. The steamboats' course went up the San Juan River, a site that had been proposed for the Nicaragua Canal, Chiong wrote: During that time, there were restrictions that prohibited the entrance of Asian citizens in the country, in spite of which, many of them defied the prohibition and settled in what is thought to have been the first Chinese presence in the Americas, perhaps before the arrival of these citizens to Peru or Panama. Shortly after World War II, which began in 1939 and ended in 1945, large quantities of Chinese began arriving in Nicaragua, but during the 1979 Sandinista revolution, many fled to nearby Honduras, Costa Rica, and the United States. =Migration to the Pacific Coast= The Chinese had begun heading to the Pacific side of Nicaragua and therefore started to settle in the cities of Managua, Granada, Leon, and Masaya at the end of the 19th century. The majority of them were men, many of whom converted to Christianity, and married Nicaraguan women, introducing the country to last names such as: Lau, Sujo, Chang, Cheng, Siu, Law, Quant, Chow, Chiong, Kuan, Wong, Samqui, Saint and Loyman, all of which represent the descendants of the first immigrants. It is approximated that the Taiwanese are descendants of 15 families. Also, there are an estimated 7,000 people who speak Chinese. Clubs and associations =Chinese Club and the Chinese Nicaraguan Association= The first club founded for Chinese Nicaraguans, Club Chino (Chinese Club), was conformed in the South Atlantic region on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. It wasn't until the 1940s that the club expanded into the capital city of Managua, after which the Asociación China Nicaragüense (Chinese Nicaraguan Association) was founded and became one of the most active and important associations of Nicaragua, due to the great economic power that the Chinese represented in the nation. =Chinese Nicaraguan Association after the Sandinista revolution= During the Sandinista revolution, many Chinese Nicaraguans emigrated to neighboring countries and the United States, causing the association to be inactive for approximately 10 years. That changed, however, in 1992, after some members approached the Chinese ambassador and expressed to him the importance to celebrate the Republic of China's Double Tenth Day (双十节). Other active clubs/associations include the Club de Jóvenes Chinos de Nicaragua (Club of Chinese Teens of Nicaragua).

T.S.Arokiyasamy Pillai arranged to buy acres of land from the Kirappatti village community and established a colony for Roman Catholics. He and his friends, all the pioneers down from clustered Trichy town chose this thorn infested barren vacant area for their future residences and christened this as \\"Crawford Colony\\" on 28.05.1927. Early in those days this area was not developed. The pioneers formed a cooperative society under No:R 305 on 28.08.1927 naming it as 'Crawford Catholic Cooperative Building Society.'Very large plots of size 150 by 90 feet, with wide roads were formed. Electricity was unknown then. Mr. T.S. Arokiasamy Pillai started a rice mill as suggested by the then electric supply company - S.M.E.S.Company and brought electricity to this area. The pioneers built a Catholic church and named it St. Therasa's church. The church was completed and consecrated in 1934. To honor the initiative and contribution of Mr. T.S.Arokiasamy Pillai a stone inscription has been erected on the church front wall. The pioneers felt the need for a school and apportioned a space for it and The Little Flower Elementary School came up there. It is managed by the sisters of St. Anne, Trichy. A machine shop cum fabrication industry was started on the west side of the colony across the Madurai road which provided employment for local people.

Meredith was a mobile hooker, he was selected 34 times for Wales between 1954 and 1962, but missed 2 matches for health and family bereavement reasons.  British Lion  In 1955 he was part of the British Lions tour of South Africa, in which the British tourists shared the Test series against South Africa 2-2 and Meredith scored his record six tries, including the pick of the second international in Cape Town. The Lions lost, but their hooker enhanced his reputation by winning a crucial strike in the scrum and then having the pace to get himself among the three-quarters and pop up outside centre Phil Davies to take a scoring pass. On the 1955 Lions Tour the all-Welsh front row of Billy Williams, Bryn Meredith and Courtney Meredith was selected for a Lions test match. This did not occur again until June 2009 when Gethin Jenkins, Adam Jones and Matthew Rees were selected as the British and Irish Lions front row for the 2nd Test against South Africa. In 1959, Meredith was a Lion again, but found himself in the unfortunate position of competing against tour captain Ronnie Dawson for a place in the Test team. Consequently, he finished as the only Lion not to appear in an international, although many judges felt he should have been selected for the final match of the series. Captaincy of the team against the Junior All Blacks was a small consolation, but he never complained about his lot and even appeared as a flanker when injuries demanded on the Australian leg of the tour. In 1962, Meredith was a live candidate for the tour captaincy himself, and although he missed out to Arthur Smith he added to his reputation in South Africa once more with another excellent tour capped by appearances in all four Tests. He retired at the end of that tour, having played eight Tests for the Lions. He was voted his country's sportsman of the year in his final season.

The first part, titled La Révolution française: les Années lumière (The French Revolution: Years of Hope) was directed by Robert Enrico. The second part, La Révolution française: les Années terribles (The French Revolution: Years of Rage), was directed by Richard T. Heffron. The full movie runs at 360 minutes, but the edited-for-television version is slightly longer. The film purports to tell a faithful and neutral story of the Revolution, from the calling of the Estates-General to the death of Maximilien de Robespierre. The film had a large budget (300 million francs) and boasted an international cast. It was shot in French, German, and English. Cast Reception The film was generally considered historically accurate. Among the few departures from the historical facts, the executioner Charles-Henri Sanson was shown executing both Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The elder Sanson actually executed only Louis XVI; it was his son who executed Marie-Antoinette. Some critics pointed, however, that the film suffered from its neutrality, which resulted in a lack of point of view and in some incoherence. The first part, which dealt with a complex historical subject, was also criticized for its disjointed pacing. The second part was considered more gripping and dramatic. Jean-François Balmer received great praise for his portrayal of a rather sympathetic Louis XVI, and Andrzej Seweryn was considered very convincing as Robespierre. The film was not a box office success in France.

He is twice invoked on dedications at Caerwent: one stone is the base of a statue of which only a pair of human feet and a pair of goose feet survive. The invocation is to Mars Lenus or Ocelus Vellaunus and the \\"numen\\" (spirit) of the emperor, and was dedicated on 23 August AD 152. The second Caerwent inscription dedicates an altar to Mars Ocelus. The god was also venerated at Carlisle, where he was once more equated with Mars and again linked to the imperial cult. So Ocelus seems to have been a British, perhaps Silurian god, associated with Mars, probably in the latter's Celtic capacity as a protector. At Caerwent he is linked with Lenus, a Treveran healing deity, and with Vellaunus, who is recorded among the Gaulish Allobroges. The Caerwent inscription uses the actual name of Ocelus and reads as follows: DEO MARTI OCELO AEL AGUSTINUS OP V S L M God Mars Ocelus Ael(ius) Agustinus Op(tio) Paid His Vow (VSLM stood for Votum Soluit Libens Merito)  References  Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend.

The film was produced by Lita Stantic and Pablo Trapero. It features Luis Margani, Adriana Aizemberg, Daniel Valenzuela, among others.Mundo grúa at the Internet Movie Database. The movie was partly funded by Argentina's INCAA as well as by the dutch Hubert Bals Fund. The picture is about working class life in Argentina that's gritty (filmed in sepia, black and white). The film follows the fortunes in the life of Rulo, an unemployed suburban man, who tries to earn a living as a crane operator in Buenos Aires. Plot The film tells of Rulo (Luis Margani), a moderately successful musician in the 1970s. Today he's divorced and an unemployed forty-something day-laborer living in Buenos Aires in the late 1990s. He's anxious for whatever work he can find. He lives with his son who's also musically inclined, and his mother (Graciana Chironi). His best friend Torres (Daniel Valenzuela), who has connections in the Argentine construction industry, finds him work as a large crane operator. Rulo is dating Adriana (Adriana Aizemberg), who runs a sandwich shop. He lands a job as an excavating machine operator in distant Patagonia. The workers live in a remote farmhouse and the relationship between management and labor is difficult. One day the workers are not fed during lunch so they refuse to work until they eat. Rulo soon discovers that making a fresh start at a late age proves to be harder than he first thought.

Critical reception Film critic Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, liked the look and tone of the film and wrote, \\"[the picture] is a stylistic throwback to 1940s Italian neo-realism. The movie's grainy, sepia-toned cinematography and low-key naturalistic performances by a cast of nonprofessionals enhance its slice-of-life authenticity.\\"Holden, Stephen.

Film critic Diego Lerer, a member of FIPRESCI, wrote an extensive essay about director Pablo Trapero's cinema films. He reviewed Mundo grúa favorably and believes Trapero's film is advancing the \\"New Argentina Cinema Wave\\" and his films continues to break away from the older Argentine storytelling. He wrote, \\"Trapero's film dared to break even freer from the classic narrative models. Even though the film has a story, and one that advances with utter efficiency, Crane World respects the characters' internal rhythm like none of the other films by young Argentines had done so far...In Trapero's film, the scenes are developed in all their length.\\"Lerer, Lerer .

History Holy Name Academy, a boarding high school for girls, located on Holt Avenue in Pomona, California, closed its doors in June 1948. In September of that year, it was reopened by Monsignor English, pastor of St. Joseph's Church, as a high school for both boys and girls of the parish and surrounding parishes. Newly staffed by the Felician Sisters, it was re-named St. Joseph High School then after a few years changed the name to Pomona Catholic High School. It was able to provide Catholic education for many years. In response to serious over crowding, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles took advantage of the sale of the old Bonita High School facility in 1959 and split Pomona Catholic into two schools. Pomona Catholic Boys High School (now Damien High School) opened in nearby La Verne in 1959 to freshman boys only. The last boys graduated from the original Pomona Catholic High School in 1962.

The dedication dates to AD 152. Mars Lenus was a god of the Treveri with great cult centres at Trier and Pommern; Ocelus was a local British deity, to whom another stone was inscribed at Caerwent, and who was also worshipped at Carlisle. Mars Lenus was clearly equated in Britain with other, localised Celtic divinities. The second inscription dedicated to Vellaunus was located at Hières-sur-Amby in the territory of the Allobroges in southern Gaul. It reads: :AVG SACR DEO :MERCVRIO :VICTORI MAC :NIACO VEILAVNO :C CAPITOIVS MACRI :NVS RESTITVITCorpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 12: 2373. :\\"To Augustus and the god Mercury the Victor Macniacus Vellaunus, C.

The root uellauno- is found in many other Celtic names, including those of the goddess Icovellauna; the hero Cassivellaunos, later famous in Welsh legend as Caswallawn; and the Catuvellauni, a tribe of southeastern Britain, whose name may also be cognate with Catalauni (Châlons-sur-Marne) and Catalaunia (Catalonia).Xavier Delamarre (2003). Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise : Une approche linguistique du vieux-celtique continental, 2e édition. Éditions Errance. . p.310. The meaning of uellauno- has been variously interpreted.

Lambert derives it from *uelna-mon-, meaning \\"chef, commandant, dirigeant\\" (chief, commander, leader).

It also works with ex- prisoners returning to the UK and family members and friends of those detained. The organisation provides humanitarian aid, advice and emotional support to people affected by overseas imprisonment. They assist British citizens during their incarceration, when they return to the UK and need access to resettlement services, and they support their family and friends throughout the trauma. Prisoners Abroad translates human rights law into practical life-saving actions by providing access to vitamins and essential food, emergency medical care, freepost envelopes to keep in touch with home and books and magazines to help sustain mental health. History Prisoners Abroad was formed in 1978 by Craig Feehan, Joe Parham, Chris Cheal and Bob Nightingale. Initially it worked with Britons held mainly in Turkey, central Asia and north Africa. Last year they supported 1,670 Britons imprisoned across the world in 87 countries. In UK terms, Prisoners Abroad is a small to medium-sized charity, with an annual turnover of £1.8 million. Welfare grants The Craig Feehan Fund, which was founded after Craig Feehan's death in 1985, provides those imprisoned in particularly poor conditions with a monthly sum of money for essentials such as bedding, food, clothing, toiletries, vitamins, newspapers and correspondence. The fund provides help to those who are destitute and have no other source of income. A vitamin fund is available to people imprisoned in countries where the nutrition is deemed inadequate for survival. Medical grants are awarded on a case by case basis for treatment of medical issues ranging from blood pressure medication to eyeglasses to major surgeries. The funds also address diseases commonly found in foreign prisons, such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Prisoners Abroad is a non-judgmental organisation and provides assistance on the basis of need and regardless of innocence or guilt. Support for families Each year Prisoners Abroad provides assistance to more than 1,800 family members. This includes one-to-one support via a helpline, a private online network for family members, as well as hosting family support groups around the country and arranging overseas visits. Resettlement Prisoners Abroad's work also extends to a resettlement service that supports those who return to the UK; they find them somewhere to stay, provide grants for food and travel, and help them take the vital steps to a new life. Last year they supported 352 people on return to the UK. Awards and patrons In 2007 Prisoners Abroad was awarded the Longford Prize, awarded annually by the Longford Trust to \\"recognise the contribution of an individual, group or organisation working in the area of penal or social reform who/which has shown outstanding qualities of humanity, courage, persistence and originality\\". In 2008 Prisoners Abroad were shortlisted for the Justice Awards and the Andy Ludlow London Homelessness Awards. In 2010 Prisoners Abroad won the Guardian Public Service Awards, Carers, Families and Communities. Prominent patrons include the Archbishop of Westminster, Sir David Wootton, Dame Harriet Walter, Jon Snow, John Walters, Bishop James Langstaff, Dominic Grieve QC and Lord Ramsbotham.

Following the launch of the all new Jowett Javelinunder the name Javelin Jupiter. (Javelin Jupiter. Spectacular Win at Le Mans. The Times, Wednesday, 28 Jun 1950; pg. 3; Issue 51729) and its successes in competition, Jowett decided to use its power train in a sports car for export in the hope of increasing their inadequate steel allocation. The chassis only was displayed in October at the London Motor Show which opened 28 September 1949 and the complete car for the first time in New York in April 1950.\\"It has been known since last October when the E.R.A. Javelin chassis was exhibited at the Motor Show that Jowett Cars have been developing a new model designed to combine exceptional road performance with comfort and docility. Full details have now been announced. . . . first public view of the complete car is being reserved for the British Automobile and Motor Cycle Show to be held in New York in April. Meanwhile the chassis alone is to be exhibited at the Geneva Motor Show at the end of March. . . . the first complete cars will go to the United States . . .\\" (New Jowett Model. The Times, Saturday, 25 Mar 1950; pg. 6; Issue 51649) Again the chassis only was given its continental launch at the Geneva Motor Show which opened 16 March 1950. It continued in production until 1954. Design features Jowett through Lawrence Pomeroy of The Motor joined forces with ERA and they persuaded Eberan von Eberhorst, formerly with Auto Union, to come to England. He joined ERA in Dunstable and, amongst other projected development and chassis work, designed and developed what became the Jupiter's tubular steel chassis. The suspension used soft torsion bars and anti-roll bars front and rear with independent suspension at the front. The engine was mounted very far forward ahead of the front axle line with the radiator low behind it over the gearbox. Adjustment of the anti-roll bars easily influenced oversteer and understeer to provide fine suspension tuning. On this torsionally stiff frame Reg Korner of Jowett put a steel framed aluminium drophead coupé body with a bench seat for three people. Eberan's chassis had been designed for a closed coupé and it proved to require strengthening. The anti-roll bars were abandoned. There was no external access to the boot (trunk) and the bonnet (hood) was rear hinged and opened complete with the wings. These cars were only for export, it was hoped coachbuilders would supply the local market. An initial 75 chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders such as Stabilimenti Farina, Ghia Suisse, Abbott of Farnham and others in Britain. The high cost of these, mostly handsome, bodies for what was only a 1500 c.c. car obliged Jowett to build their own complete cars.Paul Clark & Edmund Nankivell, The Complete Jowett History, 1991, Foulis Haynes The Jowett factory made 731 Mk1 and 94 Mk1a cars. The Mk 1a came out in late 1952 with a little more power (63 bhp) and an opening lid to a boot of larger capacity.

Two Zenith carburettors were fitted. A four speed gearbox with column change was used. Motor sport success The Jupiter achieved competition success with a record-breaking class win at the 1950 Le Mans 24 Hour race, a class one-two in the 1951 Monte Carlo International Rally, an outright win in the 1951 Lisbon International Rally, and a class one-two in a gruelling four- hour sports car race on the public road at Dundrod Circuit in Northern Ireland in September 1951. This was a resurrection of the famous Ulster Tourist Trophy races of 1928-1936 previously run on the Ards circuit. Le Mans was again class-won in 1951 and 1952, and lesser events were taken in 1952 but by 1953 newer faster cars were proving a match for the Jupiter which was after all a well-appointed touring car first and foremost. Performance and contemporary driving impressions A car tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1950 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 18.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1086 including taxes. At this time a Jaguar XK120 cost £1263 including taxes when tested by the same magazine. A road test by the competitor magazine, The Autocar recorded a top speed of 90 mph (145 km/h) but acceleration to for these testers took them to 20.4 seconds. The final drive ratio on the first publicly presented prototype of 4.1 to 1 was reduced to 4.56 to 1 and it is possible that the final drive on the tested cars was not the same. The Autocar testers were enthused by the car's performance, especially in view of the \\"well-known ... verve of the Javelin engine\\" and its \\"susceptiblity to power output increase\\". The Jupiter's compression ratio of 8:1 was nevertheless higher than on most UK market cars in 1950, and some mild \\"pinging\\" was recorded using 72 octane fuel, which was the highest grade normally available in Britain at the time. Other features drawing particular praise included quick, light though highly geared steering and gear change linkage which was \\"unusually positive for a steering column layout\\". Jupiter R1 A racing derivative of the Jupiter, the R1, was entered in the 1951 1500 cc sports car race at Watkins Glen, driven to first place by George Weaver. In the 1952 24 Hours of Le Mans another example won its class at 13th overall, driven by Marcel Becquart and Gordon Wilkins. Three examples of the R1 were made - one survives. Jupiter R4 The original Jupiter was a somewhat heavy car and this handicapped its performance. An intended successor, the R4, was made with fibreglass body and a new lighter chassis and showed the potential of being a genuine car but Jowett closed before the car could reach production. Three prototypes were made of which two survive.

Brünnich was the son of Christian Christoph Brünnich, a Lutheran pastor and mathematician, and his wife Pauline Therese, née Kühnehe and was born at Gorizia, then in Austria-Hungary, now Italy. Raised in Bohemia, he was educated in Switzerland after his family moved there in 1874 and obtained his knowledge of chemistry at the federal polytechnic school at Zurich. He travelled in Russia and for a period was chemist in a sugar-mill in Bohemia. While performing Swiss military service in 1884, he met Dr J. J. Mueller of Gayndah, Queensland, and decided to emigrate to Australia, arriving in Brisbane early in 1885. In 1887, Brünnich became chief chemist and mill manager for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at Homebush, near Mackay. In 1897 he was appointed government agricultural chemist in the new Queensland Department of Agriculture. For about 35 years he advised the department on a multiplicity of problems relating to agriculture in Queensland, and drafted many bills for the government relating among other things to fertilizers, stock foods, pure seeds and the destruction of pests. He also made scientific investigations into the prickly pear problem, the use of dipping fluids, water pollution and the provision of phosphatic licks for stock. He was vice- president of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1907, president in 1908 and treasurer in 1909-14. Brünnich did valuable pioneer work in his investigations of pasture composition and set a high standard in his department. Generally he was a strong influence in the development of applied chemistry during his time. He retired from the agriculture department in September 1931 and died of cerebro-vascular disease on 3 July 1933. In 1886, he married Kate Terry, who survived him with two sons and three daughters. He was a foundation member and fellow of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute and was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain in 1905.

Moray was the eldest son of Sir John de Moray of Drumsargard and his wife Mary, daughter to Malise, 7th Earl of Strathearn. He appears in sources for the first time in 1335 as one of the leaders of the patriotic party in Scotland. By this point he had become a powerful military leader, being styled by Walter Bower \\"Lord of Clydesdale\\". In 1335, Moray met with other Scottish nobles to reject the terms of peace offered by Edward III of England, and to reaffirm their resistance to English rule. He consequently had his lands forfeited by Edward Balliol, who bestowed them on English knight Anthony de Lucy. The same year, Moray is recorded as having slain a knight named Godfrey Ross, the Sheriff of Ayr and Lanark, who had killed his brother. In 1341 he was present at the parliament held at Scone, which was the first after the return of King David from France. In 1342, the English surrendered Stirling Castle to the Scots, and Moray was appointed as its keeper. He substantially strengthened and provisioned the castle, spending the then enormous sum of £150 on equipment. In the words of Andrew of Wyntoun, he \\"inforyst it grettumly, for riche he was and full mychty\\". Moray received considerable grants of land for his services, and was evidently a favourite of King David. In 1344, David assigned Moray the earldom of Strathearn, which had been forfeited by Moray's uncle Earl Malise. Earl Maurice was killed at the Battle of Neville's Cross on 17 October 1346. Marriage and issue Earl Maurice married Joan de Menteith, the daughter of Sir John Menteith of Ruskie, who had been married twice before; firstly to Moray's grandfather Malise, 7th Earl of Strathearn, and secondly to John Campbell, Earl of Atholl.

Early life  Edward Lee Greene was born on August 20, 1843 in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. In 1859 Greene moved to Wisconsin and began studying at Albion Academy, a very reputable institution with a religious emphasis. There Greene met Thure Kumlien, a Swedish Naturalist with an interest in botany. Greene accompanied Kumlein on field trips, further developing Greene’s interest in botany. In August 1862, Greene joined his father and brothers in joining the 13th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army. Though he never rose above the rank of private in his three years of service, Greene was able to advance his botanical studies, collecting specimens as he marched through Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama. Following his release from the Army, Greene returned to Albion Academy, earning his Bachelor of Philosophy in 1866. While in the service, Greene thought of moving west of the Mississippi, a desire he realized in 1870. With the aid of botanists Asa Gray of Cambridge, Massachusetts and George Engelmann of St. Louis, Missouri, Greene made preparations to study botany in the West. While in Colorado in 1871, Greene renewed his spirituality and became both a botany teacher and a candidate for Episcopal priesthood, becoming ordained in 1873. In February 1874 Greene assumed pastorship of a church in Vallejo, California, the beginning of many short stays with churches throughout the Southwest. During these travels, Greene continued collecting plants, making forays into Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico. In 1876–1877, while Greene was an episcopal priest in Yreka, California, he discovered the first specimens of Phlox hirsuta, a small flowering plant found only in that area. He eventually accepted a position as rector of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Berkeley, California. Between his arrival in 1881 and 1883, Greene began to drift away from the Episcopal Church toward Roman Catholicism, costing him his congregation and his standing within the ministry. Locked out of St. Mark's, Greene gave in to pressure and resigned in 1883, converting to Catholicism only a year later. Academic career Beginning in 1882, Greene began lecturing at the University of California. Following his resignation, he became curator of the herbarium at the California Academy of Sciences. In 1885, was hired as the first professor of botany at the University of California, Berkeley (1885–1895). While he was chair of the newly founded botany department, Greene was one of only three American representatives to the International Committee on Botanical Nomenclature and president of the Madison Botanical Congress. His controversial advocacy of nomenclature reform brought him into conflict with the president of the University, leading him to accept a position at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. from 1895 to 1904. Greene then became an associate in botany at the Smithsonian Institution (1904–1915), transferring some 4,000 volumes and his valuable herbarium to the institution for a period of ten years. Greene began to focus on the history of his field, publishing his seminal work Landmarks of Botanical History, Part 1 in 1909. The second volume was submitted to the Smithsonian as a work in progress but was never completed, the rough draft being published posthumously in 1936. While at the Smithsonian, Greene renewed contact with Fr. Julius Nieuwland, a professor of botany at the University of Notre Dame and a student from Greene’s years at the Catholic University of America. Following the expiration of his agreement with the Smithsonian in 1915, Greene moved to South Bend, Indiana along with his library and herbarium specimens. Greene returned to Washington, D.C. in October that same year to continue work on the Landmarks of Botanical History, Part 2, which would eventually be published posthumously in 1983. Edward Lee Greene fell ill while in Washington, D.C., and died in Providence Hospital on November 10, 1915. Legacy By the end of his career Greene had named over 4,400 new species of plants, published 565 original papers, and amassed a library of over 4,000 volumes, some of which have no duplicates in North America. Greene’s library and collections remain at the University of Notre Dame in the Greene-Nieuwland Herbarium.

Biography Blau was born in a middle-class Jewish family, to Mayer (Markus) Blau, a court lawyer and music publisher, and his wife, Florentine Goldzweig. After having obtained the general certificate of education from the girls' high school run by the Association for the Extended Education of Women, she studied physics and mathematics at the University of Vienna from 1914 to 1918; her PhD graduation was in March 1919.Marietta Blau. Jewish Women's Archive Blau is credited with developing (photographic) nuclear emulsions that were usefully able to image and accurately measure high energy nuclear particles and events. Additionally, this established a method to accurately study reactions caused by cosmic ray events. Her nuclear emulsions significantly advanced the field of particle physics in her time. For her work she was nominated for the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physics by Erwin Schrödinger.  Pre World War 2  From 1919 to 1923, Blau held several positions in industrial and University research institutions in Austria and Germany; in 1921, she moved to Berlin to work at a manufacturer of x-ray tubes, a position she left in order to become an assistant at the Institute for Medical Physics at the University of Frankfurt am Main. From 1923 on, she worked as an unpaid scientist at the Institute for Radium Research of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. A stipend by the Austrian Association of University Women made it possible for her to do research also in Göttingen and Paris (1932/1933). In her Vienna years, Blau's main interest was the development of the photographic method of particle detection. The methodical goals which she pursued were the identification of particles, in particular alpha-particles and protons, and the determination of their energy based on the characteristics of the tracks they left in emulsions; there, she developed a photographic emulsion technique used in the study of cosmic rays, being the first scientist use nuclear emulsions to detect neutrons. For this work, Blau and her former student Hertha Wambacher received the Lieben Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1937. It was her greatest success when, also in 1937, she and Wambacher discovered \\"disintegration stars\\" in photographic plates that had been exposed to cosmic radiation at an altitude of 2,300 metres (≈7,500 feet) above sea level. These stars are the patterns of particle tracks from nuclear reactions (spallation events) of cosmic-ray particles with nuclei of the photographic emulsion. Because of her Jewish descent, Blau had to leave Austria in 1938 after the country's annexation by Nazi Germany, a fact which caused a severe break in her scientific career. She first went to Oslo. Then, through the intercession of Albert Einstein,Marietta Blau, Pionera de la física de partículas que vino a México recomendada por Einstein. Diario Judío she obtained a teaching position at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional in Mexico City and later at Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo But since conditions in Mexico made research extremely difficult for her, she seized an opportunity to move to the United States in 1944.  Post-war  In the United States, Blau worked in industry until 1948, afterwards (until 1960) at Columbia University, Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Miami. At these institutions, she was responsible for the application of the photographic method of particle detection in high-energy experiments at particle accelerators. In 1960, Blau returned to Austria and conducted scientific work at the Institute for Radium Research until 1964 – again without pay. She headed a working group analyzing particle-track photographs from experiments at CERN and supervised a dissertation in this field. In 1962, she received the Erwin Schrödinger Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but an attempt to make her also a corresponding member of the Academy was not successful.Marietta Blau .

It was created in 1915 as Washington's first state park. The park covers and features fishing, boating, and camping as well as mountain trails for hiking and biking. It is managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. History Pair of teenagers examine a tidepool at Larrabee State Park, 1973 In 1913, the governor of Washington, Ernest Lister, proposed establishing a park along Chuckanut Drive. He mentioned this idea to Bellingham businessman Charles Larrabee, who agreed to deed waterfront property he owned in the area for the purpose. He died in 1914, but his wife Frances made sure the deal went through to completion. The governor officially accepted the park on October 23, 1915. On November 22, 1915, Washington State Board of Park Commissioners formally accepted it as well, thus making it the first state park in Washington. Initially called Chuckanut State Park, the park's name was changed to Larrabee in 1923. The park began as a place mainly used for picnicking and to access the beach. After a series of relatively unsuccessful caretakers and trouble from the Great Depression, the park was experiencing low attendance by the early 1930s. Things began to turn around in 1935 under the leadership of manager Dave Johnson, who spearheaded the effort to improve the park, rallying local organizations, schools, churches, and businesses to increase use of the park. In 1936, the Works Progress Administration provided $30,000 in federal funding, leading to improvements such as playground equipment, a water system, and kitchen shelters. The Larrabee family donated another 1500 acres in 1937, with neighboring landowners making additional contributions. Further developments were made, and the park continued to attract visitors, reaching a quarter million annual visitors by 1965. Activities and amenities Fragrance Lake on Chuckanut Mountain The park features a short walk down to a pebble beach with views onto Samish Bay and the San Juan Islands. For longer excursions, there are 13 miles of biking trails and 15 miles of hiking trails, including trails leading 1,940 feet up Chuckanut Mountain. Picnicking, boating, saltwater fishing, sailboarding, and beachcombing along 8,100 feet of saltwater shoreline are among the other recreational options. Two mountain lakes, Fragrance Lake and Lost Lake, offer freshwater fishing for hikers. The park also includes camping sites, an amphitheater, and large fields.

Biography  After receiving admission to the Jesuit Order, João de Loureiro served as a missionary in Goa, capital of Portuguese India (3 years) and Macau (4 years). In 1742 he traveled to Cochinchina, remaining there for 35 years. Here he worked as a mathematician and naturalist for the king of Cochinchina, acquiring knowledge on the properties and uses of native medicinal plants. In 1777, he journeyed to Canton, in Bengal, returning to Lisbon four years later.JSTOR, Loureiro and his botanical work by E.D. Merrill Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society Vol. 72, No. 4 (Apr., 1933), pp. 229-239 During this period, the Captain Thomas Riddel gave Loureiro the books Systema Naturae, Genera Plantarum and Philosophia Botanica by Carl Linnaeus, which greatly influenced the Portuguese botanist. The first 40 years he stayed in Vietnam, João de Loureiro was inventorying indigenus herbal remedies. His local garden contained 1,000 unique herbal species, making him one of the greatest botanist collectors of the XVIIIth century. João de Loureiro 1790, he published the book Flora Cochinchinensis sponsored by the Royal Portuguese Academy of Sciences.

Before 1844, the area was officially a detached part of Wiltshire. The estate is named after the Norreys family from Ockwells Manor in Bray and Yattendon Castle. One of their minor manors covered this area and was known as Norreys Manor. More specifically the name was taken from the large Norreys Avenue, which now runs through the southern portion of the estate. This road was built on arable farmland in the late 1940s as emergency housing during World War II. The area contains many houses, mostly built in the 1960s, including much of Ashridge Road, Budges Road, Eustace Crescent, Barrett Crescent and Longs Way. After London Road and Finchampstead Road, Norreys Avenue is one of the largest residential roads in Wokingham. It starts off at a junction off Wiltshire Road, heads slightly NNE before turning sharply north, then east, the curving around back to a southern direction, forming the distinctive \\"n\\" shape. A few cul-de-sacs appear on the road, including Coronation Square, Elizabeth Road. In 2011, the Council proposed to demolish the 1960s blocks of flats on Eustace Crescent and replace them with more modern, low-rise accommodation, due to the deteriorating quality of the buildings.

They were very popular until Victorian times, but fell out of general use in the 20th century. Many survive for aesthetic value, particularly where well carved or of historic value. Many are part of or in the grounds of a listed building or in conservation areas. Purpose A marriage stone at Woodside House,Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont 1604–1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow. P. 381. Parish of Beith. Marriage stones serve as a record of a marriage, the joining together of two families, although in Jersey https://members.societe-jersiaise.org/alexgle/stonejsy.html, where they are probably more common than elsewhere in the British Isles, they rarely, if ever, bear the date of a marriage, but mostly the names of the occupants of a property at the time it was built, restored or extended, or when it was acquired by those whose initials appear on the stone especially important in aristocratic families and also sometimes practised amongst the newly established and monied middle classes. They were sometimes added to a building which was constructed specifically as the new family home for the married couple, especially when the dowry was large, or were carved into a pre- existing lintel over the main entrance or over a fireplace. The stones also clearly indicated the ownership of the building to onlookers at the time as well as serving as a record for posterity of both marital bliss and often also of social advancement.McKean, Charles (2001). The Scottish Chateau. The Country house of Renaissance Scotland. Sutton Publishing. . p. 12. Datestones are a subtly different category in that they primarily commemorate the construction of a building rather than record a marriage. They may do both and such symbolism as entwined hearts indicates that they serve to perform both functions. Date stones are far more common than marriage stones and are found on most types of vernacular buildings, indeed they are in vogue again today (2007), partly through the influence of the significance of the 2000 millennium year. Some buildings have both marriage stones and datestones, such as 'The Hill' at Dunlop, which has a date stone on the 'mansion house' and even the gateposts are dated.  Positioning  Old Town The stones were placed where they would be easily and frequently seen by visitors, usually on the lintel above the front door of a house, above a fireplace or in a prominent position facing the entrance or in the gardens, such as above a doorway in wall. Many are no longer visible having been covered over in some way such as when older buildings have been extended, porches built, etc. Often the husband's initials were on the left and the wife's were on the right.  Design  Usually carved into stone or sometimes wood, they can be very detailed, with usually only the initials of the married couple, the date of the marriage and sometimes the coat of arms of the two families, just those of the husband and very rarely the combined coats of arms of both families. In some cases the adornment was religious in nature, such as at 'The Hill' farm mansion house (see photograph) or an artistic design simply placed there as an ornamentation. The designs are found cut into the stone or standing proud of the rock face. Originally some of these stones would have been brightly painted and adorned with gilt.

Hindu weddings In Hinduism, it is customary in a marriage ceremony for the bride to stand on a stone slab or millstone to symbolise her commitment to the marriage during times of difficulty, in a practice known as Shila Arohan (Ascending the stone). Holed stones On the crest of a hill near the village of Doagh in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, sits a Bronze Age standing stone or 'holestone'. It is 1.5 metres high, with a 10 cm diameter hole cut into it. It is not known why the Holestone was created, but has attracted visitors seeking external love and happiness since at least the 18th century. Upon reaching the Holestone couples undertake a traditional ceremony where the woman reaches her hand through the circular hole and her partner takes it, thus pledging themselves to love each other forever. There is a legend regarding a black horse that inhabits the field in which the holestone is situated. According to this legend a young couple were married at the stone, but the groom committed an act of adultery on their wedding night.

R. P. Dickson. She lived in Kuwait for 61 years, half of them as a widow, and published several books on the country. She was a keen amateur botanist and had a plant, Horwoodia dicksoniae, named in her honour. Biography Violet Penelope Lucas-Calcraft was born in Gautby, Lincolnshire, England. Her father was Neville Lucas-Calcraft, a land agent. The 1900Presumably this ought to indicate the 1901 census? census shows the family were living in Moat House, Gautby: the house was owned by Robert Charles de Gray Vyner, for whom Violet's father worked. She met her husband Harold Dickson (1881 - 1959) in Marseilles, France, shortly after the end of World War I, where she was working in a bank. She travelled out to meet him in India, where he was stationed and where they were married. Shortly afterwards he was posted to Iraq. Harold Dickson served as British Political Agent in Bahrain from 1919–1920. He also served in Persia (present-day Iran). In 1929 he was appointed British Political Agent to Kuwait, and served in this role until 1936. He briefly held this role again in 1941. Violet accompanied him on all these postings, and soon became fluent in Arabic. After his retirement from political service, Harold Dickson worked for the Kuwait Oil Company. She was a keen botanist and published a book on the flora of Bahrain and Kuwait in 1955. She regularly sent wild flower collections to the botanic gardens at Kew Gardens in London, and the desert plant that she introduced to science, Horwoodia dicksoniae (known as khuzama in Arabic), was named in her honour. She wrote her autobiography, Forty Years in Kuwait, at the urging of Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond series of books. He had travelled to Kuwait in 1960 to research and write a book for the Kuwait Oil Company, and Dame Violet was one of the people he interviewed. Fleming's book, titled State of Excitement, was never published as the Kuwait Oil Company 'did not care for its tone'; Dickson's book appeared 11 years after Fleming first suggested she should write it. As the wife of a British government figure, she was expected to assist her husband in his duties, primarily at social functions and by accompanying him on some of his travels across the region. As a result, she came to know many of the rulers and dignitaries of the region, including King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, (who on one occasion presented her with an oryx, which became a pet), King Faisal of Iraq, four Kuwaiti rulers and many tribal sheikhs. She also dealt frequently with Western diplomats. This contact continued after the death of her husband, as her knowledge of Kuwait and the feuds and rivalries among the kingdom's 600-strong royal family made her an indispensable resource for British ambassadors and visiting diplomats. In 1976 Violet's 80th birthday party was a notable event for the British expatriate community in Kuwait. Violet Dickson had a son, diplomat Hanmer Yorke Warrington Saud (\\"Dickie\\") Dickson, MBE (died 2005),http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/26119/dicksonWarsidaha Ururka Ingiriiska Iyo Soomaalida (Journal of the Anglo-Somali Society), collected vols. 33-40, The Anglo-Somali Society, 2003, p. 63 and a daughter, (Irene) Zahra Freeth (née Dickson),Creating the Arabian Gulf: The British Raj and the Invasions of the Gulf, Paul Rich, Lexington Books, 2009, p. 216 also an author on Middle Eastern topics. Dame Violet was given the honorific title Umm Saud (Arabic: أم سعود meaning Mother of Saud), and was also known as Umm Kuwait (Mother of Kuwait). She was also given the honorific Hajjiyah, a term of respect meaning a female who has completed the Haj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. This is unusual, as non-Muslims are not allowed to perform the Haj. Dickson was made Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1942, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1976. She was awarded the Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal awarded by the Royal Society for Asian Affairs, London (formerly the Royal Central Asian Society) in 1960, for her work among the Bedouin women of Arabia and her study of the flora and fauna of the desert. Death The British Political Agency in Kuwait was based in a house that had been built in 1870 for a Kuwaiti merchant. The Dicksons moved into the house in 1929, and the building served as the British political agency until 1935. Harold Dickson continued to live there until his death in 1959, and Violet until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when she was evacuated, unwillingly, to Britain. She intended to return to her home in Kuwait City, but died on 4 January 1991, aged 94. thumb The house was ransacked during the invasion, but has since been restored by the Kuwaiti National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters, and is now a tourist attraction. It is one of few surviving examples of 19th-century Kuwaiti architecture, with thirty rooms on two floors. Eponymous scholarship The British Council in Kuwait offers the Dame Violet Dickson Scholarship to Kuwaiti women to encourage them to continue their postgraduate studies in the UK. The scholarship is described as 'prestigious' and 'Kuwait's flagship award for women', reflecting the esteem in which Violet Dickson was held. Archive Papers and photographs by Violet Dickson are held at the Middle East Centre Archive, St Antony's College, Oxford University. (MECA reference: GB165-0364).

While the vehicle is moving forwards, the driver can pull a lever that makes it stop and go backwards at the same speed. Power Shuttles are also known under various trade names including Power Reverser In forward/reverse position of the F-R lever, the pressure is built in the system due to flow to wet clutch. During, the pressure rise,F-R clutch is in energized condition which makes the vehicle to move forward/Reverse direction. Flow to tank line is blocked during the flow to F/R clutch. Power shuttle are incorporated in transmissions in three forms: counter-shaft, full planetary (power shifts), and CVT transmissions. Counter shaft transmissions In this case generally forward reverse synchronizers are replaced by the multi-plate friction clutches. Typically the multi-plate clutches are arranged on the main shaft or on the counter shaft. The forward reverse section of the gear box is generally located in the forward section as close to the engine as possible. This is beneficial to the forward reverse control elements as they are not subjected to the high relative torque. The challenge involved in providing this feature in the existing transmissions is the complex shaft arrangement. This problem arises due to the limitation of centre distance between the two shafts and fixed axial dimensions due to the vehicle size limitations. Full planetary (power shift) In this type of transmissions the planetary action is used for providing forward or reverse action to the gear box. CVT/IVT Here the automatic nature of the gear box takes care of the direction change by either engaging planetary sets or by engaging multi-plate clutches or by some other means.

Later in life, Larrabee and his wife Frances donated much land for civic purposes, including schools and parks, and were considered stewards of the city of Bellingham. Early life Larrabee was born in 1843 to William and Mary Ann Larrabee in Portville, New York. He was six years old when the family moved to Omro, Wisconsin in 1849, where his father opened a general store. Once he was old enough, Larrabee traveled to Poughkeepsie, New York to take a course at a business college to add to his public education. Starting in 1869, Larrabee and his brother, Samuel E. Larabie (1845–1914), operated a bank in Deer Lodge, Montana. Business career In 1875, he went to Montana, and in 1887, his efforts as a prospector were rewarded by the discovery of the valuable Mountain View near Butte. After selling this property to the Boston & Montana Company, he moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1890, he arrived in Bellingham, Washington and associated himself with Nelson Bennett, the founder of Tacoma, Washington. Together they founded the town of Fairhaven and formed the Fairhaven Land Company, which was financed by Larrabee,Larrabee family papers, Center for Pacific Northwest Studies, Heritage Resources, Western Washington University who was also president of the company in 1896. Larrabee later purchased the land company holdings of his partner and retained control of the corporation until his death, doing work in land development, including building the Fairhaven Hotel, described by one reporter of the Fairhaven Herald as \\"million-dollar edifice.\\" Larrabee founded the Citizens Bank of Bellingham, and was that institution's first president. He was also a member of the firm of Larrabee Brothers, a group of private bankers in Deer Lodge, Montana. Larrabee organized the Roslyn-Cascade Coal Company of Roslyn, Washington and developed what was known as one of the finest coal mines in the state of Washington. Larrabee was one of the first area businessmen in the Pacific Northwest region to realize the possibilities of the salmon-fishing industry. He also owned a stock ranch known as Brook-Nook, near Dillon, Montana, where he raised trotting horses. Later life On August 3, 1892, Larrabee married Frances Frazier Payne (Jan 15, 1867 – June 11, 1941), a daughter of Benjamin and Adelia Payne, residents of St. Louis, Missouri. The Larrabees had four children: Charles Francis; Edward Payne, who served as a lieutenant in World War I; Mary Adele; and Benjamin Howard. In 1914, Larrabee hired Seattle architect Carl Gould to design a house in Bellingham and christened Larrabee Manor, now Lairmont Manor, upon its completion. Charles Larrabee died in September of that year before construction even began. The house was finished under the supervision of his wife, Frances, and is now on the United States National Register of Historic Places and maintained by a non-profit trusteeship. Legacy In 1890, a Bellingham grammar school was named in Larrabee's honor. The school was closed down in 2014. Soon after Larrabee's death, his family donated of land to the state of Washington for the creation of a state park in Larrabee's name.

Background Roots was born in Clarendon, Jamaica. He was raised by his grandmother after his parents moved to the United Kingdom, until he joined them at age 11. He was raised as a Christian, but converted to the Rastafari faith aged 18. Music Roots has performed with James Brown and Maxi Priest and was nominated for a Best Reggae Act MOBO award in 1998.Best Reggae Act MOBO Nomination He was a friend of Bob Marley when he resided in the UK and performed \\"Happy Birthday Mr. President\\" for Nelson Mandela in 1996 on his trip to Brixton. He gained widespread fame after appearing on the UK television programme Dragons' Den, where he gained £50,000 funding for his Reggae Reggae Sauce. Reggae Reggae Sauce Levi Roots' Reggae Reggae Sauce is a jerk barbecue sauce. In 2006 4,000 bottles of the sauce were sold at the Notting Hill Carnival. He later took the sauce to a food trade show, where he was spotted by a BBC producer who approached him to appear on Dragons' Den. He appeared in the first episode of the fourth series in February 2007, seeking £50,000 of investment from the Dragons in return for a 20% equity stake in Reggae Reggae Sauce. Despite erroneously claiming that he had an order for 2.5 million litres of the sauce (when in fact the order was for 2,500 kilograms), he was offered the £50,000 for a 40% stake in his business by Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh. Shortly after his appearance on the programme, Sainsbury's announced that they would be stocking the sauce in 600 of their stores. Leading from the success of his spicy sauce, Roots released an extended version of his song \\"Reggae Reggae Sauce\\" which features one of his children (Joanne) on backing vocals. The music video features a cameo from Peter Jones. All of the money raised went to Comic Relief. The song, which formed part of his pitch on Dragons' Den (and was also sung by Roots in an appearance on Harry Hill's TV Burp), was also released as a download single. \\"Proper Tings (The Reggae Reggae Sauce Song)\\" received its first play on Allan Lake's breakfast show on Core. A news story in The Grocer magazine in 2010 states that a range of ready meals were to be launched, and that Roots had stated that the value of the brand had then increased to £30 million. Papine Jerk Centre and Levi Roots' Caribbean Smokehouse Levi Root's first London restaurant, the Papine Jerk Centre, was on the Winstanley Estate in Battersea, Clapham Junction from 2010-2012, His children were working alongside him. The shop would also provide a lunchtime service to a local school (Thames Christian College) before closing. In December 2015, Levi Roots opened his first franchise restaurant in Westfield Stratford City. It closed in 2019. Books and television Levi Roots' Reggae Reggae Cookbook was published in 2008, with a foreword by Roots' investor, Peter Jones. The book has chapters on Roots' story of coming to London and an introduction to Caribbean ingredients. To coincide with the release of his recipe book, Roots appeared on the edition of 3 June 2008 of BBC's Ready Steady Cook as a celebrity. He achieved the second place against Lesley Waters. Roots had a television cooking show, Caribbean Food Made Easy, on BBC2, with a book of the same name published in August 2009. The show followed Roots as he travelled the UK and Jamaica demonstrating easy ways to cook Caribbean food at home. Roots appeared on Celebrity Mastermind in 2010, coming second with 13 points. He also appeared on Big Brother, where he cooked a Caribbean barbecue for the housemates. Roots also made a special appearance in the 2011 urban comedy movie Anuvahood where he plays himself.

He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Leeds in 1986. From 1986 through 1989 he worked for Hewlett-Packard Labs, in their network and communications research group in Bristol, England. He moved to the United States in 1989 and earned both his master's degree in 1992 and PhD in 1995 from the University of California at Berkeley. During spring 1995, he worked briefly for Cisco Systems where he helped architect their GSR 12000 router. His PhD thesis was on \\"Scheduling Cells in an Input-Queued Cell Switch\\", with advisor Professor Jean Walrand. He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1995 as assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science. In 1997, McKeown co-founded Abrizio Inc. with Anders Swahn, where he was CTO. Abrizio was acquired by PMC-Sierra in 1999 for stock shares worth $400 million. He was promoted to associate professor in 2002. He was co-founder in 2003 (with Sundar Iyer) and CEO of Nemo Systems, which Cisco Systems bought for $12.5 million cash in 2005. He became faculty director of the Clean Slate Program in 2006, and was promoted to full professor at Stanford in 2010. In 2007, Casado, McKeown and Shenker co-founded Nicira Networks, a Palo Alto, California based company working on network virtualization, acquired by VMWare for $1.26 billion in July 2012. = Research = McKeown is active in the software-defined networking (SDN) movement, which he helped start with Scott Shenker and Martin Casado. SDN and OpenFlow arose from the PhD work of Casado at Stanford University, where he was a student of McKeown. OpenFlow is a novel programmatic interface for controlling network switches, routers, WiFi access points, cellular base stations and WDM/TDM equipment. OpenFlow challenged the vertically integrated approach to switch and router design of the past twenty years.Video Demos of OpenFlow McKeown works closely with Guru Parulkar, Executive Director of the Stanford Open Network Research Centre (ONRC) and the Open Networking Lab (ON.Lab). In 2011, McKeown and Shenker co-founded the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) to transfer control of OpenFlow to a newly created not-for-profit organization.ONF Website Since 2013, McKeown has promoted the idea that network switches should be programmable rather than fixed. A collaboration between TI and Stanford, led to the PISA (protocol independent switch architecture), published originally under the name RMT. The P4 language was created to specify how packets should be processed in programmable switches. P4 is an open-source language maintained by P4.org, a non-profit McKeown founded with Jennifer Rexford and Amin Vahdat. McKeown co-founded Barefoot Networks to build and sell PISA switches, to demonstrate that programmable switches can be built at the same power, performance and cost as fixed-function switches. = Awards and distinctions = In 2000, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Communications Society Stephen O. Rice Prize for the best paper in communications theory went to a paper on \\"Achieving 100% Throughput in an Input-Queued Switch\\", which McKeown co-authored with Adisak Mekkittikul, Venkat Anantharam and Jean Walrand. The paper discussed dealing with the problem of head-of-line blocking using Virtual Output Queues. McKeown holds an honorary doctorate from ETH Zurich.

A member of the Éclaireurs de France scouting association during his youth, he joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, socialist party) after the split at the Tours party congress in 1920 and wrote articles in Populaire (Popular), the press organ of the SFIO. Elected official appointed in 1932 at the time of the second Coalition of the left, he was then named under-secretary of State in the Popular Front government of Léon Blum. He participated in the organisation of the People's Olympiad in Barcelona, organized to counter the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin which were used as a propaganda instrument of Nazism.  Biography  As a child, Lagrange was registered with the Éclaireurs de France, a scouting movement which had no religious affiliation. At the end of his studies at the Lycée Henri-IV, in August 1917, Lagrange joined the army. On his return, Lagrange was registered in the Faculty of Law and at the Institute of political sciences. Shortly after the Tours Congress (December 1920), he joined the SFIO, directed by Paul Faure, Jean Longuet and Léon Blum and joined the Socialist students' organisation. Having obtained his law degree, Lagrange registered in 1922 at the bar of Paris. Affected by the horrors of World War I, Lagrange reserved in particular his services to victims of tuberculosis, of lung diseases and of poison gas. He married Madeleine Veiller in 1925. The following year, Lagrange met André Malraux and Jean Prévost. Lagrange mixed then with the intellectual movement of the 1930s, being linked with a number of writers, historians, artists and scientists. Lagrange became a writer with the newspaper Le Populaire, the press organ of the SFIO, and held there a chronique on legal topics. Lagrange stood in the legislative elections in 1928, in the XIe district of Paris but was defeated. At the time of the elections of May 1932, Lagrange was designated as a socialist candidate looking to win back the first district of Avesnes-sur-Helpe, in the Nord. At the public meetings, Lagrange stressed the need, for the working class, to be informed and organized if it wanted to lead one day. After the 6 February 1934 riots organised by far-right leagues, the Cartel des gauches was toppled. For the first time in the history of the Third Republic (1871-1940), threats of a right-wing coup d'état had been enough to overthrow a democratically elected government. Following this event, many people on the left believed in a fascist conspiracy to topple the Republic. Thus, they started organising in anti-fascist groups, preparing in advance the Comintern's Popular Front strategy. Following the victory of the Popular Front at the 1936 legislative elections, Lagrange was then named under-secretary of State for Sport and given responsibility for the organisation of Leisure, under the authority of the Minister for Public Health Henri Sellier. It was the first time that France had such a state secretary, and the Popular Front enacted the first paid holidays (2 weeks), among other social reforms. His mandate was not addressed exclusively to youth but to all of society. Lagrange was focused nevertheless on the young because they constituted the future of society. Lagrange strongly opposed the fascist model of sport, which transformed it into a substitute for belligerent activities and instrumentalized it in a militarist manner. To the contrary, Lagrange advocated a conception of sports based on anti-militarism and on the fulfillment of individual personality: > “… It cannot be a question in a democratic country of militarizing the > distractions and the pleasures of the masses and of transforming the joy > skillfully distributed into a means of not thinking.” Lagrange dedicated himself in developing sporting, tourist and cultural leisure, but opposed the professionalisation of sports, creating an elitist caste of sportsmen, and was against their development in France. Lagrange was at the origin of the creation of the popular leisure pass which grants 40% of reduction on rail-bound transports, while he encouraged and impelled the movement of youth hostels. 1936 in France was witness, under the Popular Front, to the first departures towards snow resorts with special trains and reduced fares on the cable cars; popular cruises were also later introduced. Lagrange also played a major role in the co-organisation of the People's Olympiad in Barcelona with the Spanish Second Republic. Nazi Germany had managed to gain the right to organise the Olympic Games in Berlin, against Barcelona, but anti-fascists refused to participate in these Games and went on with their own project. The trials for these popular Olympiads proceeded on 4 July 1936 in the Pershing stadium in Paris, which had been built in June 1919. Lagrange chaired these days in person, along with Minister of Transport Pierre Cot, André Malraux, who later fought in the International Brigades, and other figures of the Popular Front. Through their club, the FSGT, or individually, 1.200 French athletes were registered with these anti-fascist Olympiads. But Blum finally decided not to vote for the funds to pay the athletes' expenses. A communist deputy declared: \\"Going to Berlin, is making oneself am accomplice of the torturers....\\" Nevertheless, on 9 July, when the whole of the French right voted “for” the participation of France in the Olympic Games of Berlin, whilst the left (French Communist Party included) abstained itself -- with the particularly notable exception of Pierre Mendès France, who would become Prime Minister under the Fourth Republic and negotiate the peace agreements with the Viet-minh in Indochina in 1954. The Communist Party had been, before this vote, a main supporter of the People's Olympiad. Nevertheless, several French sportsmen decided to boycott the Berlin Olympic Games anyway, and go to Barcelona where the People's Olympiads were scheduled to begin on 19 July 1936. Each stop in the train stations were the occasion of popular and joyful demonstrations, with people singing The Internationale. However, on the eve of the opening ceremony, General Franco's military pronunciamento, declared from Spanish Morocco, started the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). After having left the under-secretary's department, Lagrange then became president of the lay Committee of the youth hostels. With the 1939 declaration of war, although a deputy, he voluntarily joined the military command, before being killed on 9 June 1940 in Évergnicourt by shrapnel. : “He died in courage, in search of the truth and dignity. He was a man whom we loved.” : André Malraux Lagrange as Under-Secretary of State for Youth and Leisure (1936) Lagrange, who was opposed to professional sports and was against their development in France, had been: * Under Secretary of State for Youth and Leisure, 4 June 1936 to 22 June 1937 in the 1st Léon Blum government, * Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Leisure and Physical Education -i.e. Minister for Sports-, 23 June 1937 to 14 January 1938 in the 3rd Camille Chautemps government, * Under-Secretary of State for Sports, Leisure and Physical Education -i.e. Minister for Sports-, 14 March 1938 to 10 April 1938 in the 2nd Léon Blum government.  Mass and professional sport  Quotation from some of Léo Lagrange's speeches: * “ In sport, we must choose between two conceptions: \\\\- the first is summarized as sport as a spectacle and a practice restricted to a relatively small number of privileged people, \\\\- according to the second design, while not neglecting the spectacular aspect and the creation of champions, it is on the side of the great masses on which we have to carry out the main effort. We want the worker, the peasant and the unemployed person to find in leisure the joy of living and the feeling of their dignity ”. (Léo Lagrange, speech of 10 June 1936.) * \\" Our simple and human goal, is to allow to the masses of French youths to find in the practice of sport, joy and health and to build an organization of leisure activities so that the workers can find relaxation and a reward to their hard labour. \\" (Léo Lagrange, Under Secretary of State to Youth and at the Leisures, 1936.) * \\" Our concern is less to create champions and to lead into the Stadium 22 players in front of 40,000 or 100,000 spectators, than to invite the youths of our country to regularly go and enter onto the pitch of the stadiums, of the playing fields, to the swimming pool \\". (Léo Lagrange, discussion of the budget in the French National Assembly, 1937, quoted by J.P.Callède, ibid) * \\" If we have to make a joint effort in the sporting field, like in numerous others, it is a moral effort. I listened with a great interest to Mr. Temple who revealed the frightening dangers of the development of professional sport. Alas! when it is accepted that a human gesture which, by its nature has to be disinterested, becomes the source of important profits, the right measurement is very difficult to determine. I believe that the day when it has been admitted that play in the stadiums can be the source of important profits, we will have strongly destroyed the morality of sport. Also, with all my force and whatever the criticism, sometimes severe, of my action, I will oppose myself to the development of professional sport in our country. I hold in Parliament the responsibility to act in the interest of all the French youth, and not to create a new circus spectacle\\" (Léo Lagrange, Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Leisure and Physical Education -i.e. Minister for the Sport-, defines and specifies his policy, 3 December 1937, in front of the French National Assembly.) = Sports and the SFIO = At the same time, Fascism was instrumentalizing sports for a militarist end, while the SFIO had denounced it as a \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"reactionary\\" activity. That is, until the Popular Front, when it began to use it as a military and patriotic preparation, in anticipation of a conflict with Nazi Germany. Some SFIO members were not immune to the scientific racism discourse of the times. Thus, Georges Barthélémy, SFIO deputy, could declare that sport contributes to the \\"improvement of relations between capital and labour, henceforth to the elimination of the concept of class struggle,\\" in a perfect corporatist conception. Barthélémy also considered sport as a \\"mean to prevent the moral and physical degeneration of the race.\\" In this light, as well as in the modern professionalisation and mediatization of sports, Léo Lagrange's conception takes all its sense, both in opposition to his times and in its modernity.

These techniques are used by a variety of health care professionals with specific training in manual therapy assessment and treatment techniques.

Classification and Mechanisms  Joint mobilization is classified by the Australian physiotherapist Geoffrey Douglas Maitland into five 'grades' of motion, each of which describes the range of motion of the target joint during the procedure.Maitland, G.D. Peripheral Manipulation 2nd ed. Butterworths, London, 1977. Maitland, G.D. Vertebral Manipulation 5th ed. Butterworths, London, 1986. They are generally divided into five grades. The different grades of manipulation are known to produce selective activation of different mechanoreceptors in the joint. * Grade I - Low amplitude, rhythmically oscillating joint glide near the resting position of the available arthrokinematic joint play. Activates Type I mechanoreceptors that inhibit nociception and provide information regarding joint position. They have a low threshold and respond to a few grams of tension. : Activates mechanoreceptors in the superficial layer of the joint capsule - Bulbous corpuscles. * Grade II - Relatively large amplitude, rhythmically oscillating joint glide that carries well into the available arthrokinematic joint play. Activates Type II mechanoreceptors that inhibit nociception and provide information about joint acceleration. They also have a low threshold and respond to a few grams of tension. : Activates mechanoreceptors in the deep layer of the joint capsule - Pacinian Corpuscles. * Grade III - Relatively large amplitude, rhythmically oscillating joint glide that carries to the end of the available arthrokinematic joint play. : Designed to physically stretch the joint capsule. * Grade IV - Low amplitude, rhythmically oscillating joint glide that is performed at the end of the available arthrokinematic joint play. : Designed to physically stretch the joint capsule. * Grade V - This grade refers to the use of a single high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust performed at the end of the available joint play. : Activates Golgi tendon organ-like endings that inhibit muscle tone and monitor the direction of joint motion. They have a higher threshold and respond to forces on the order of kilograms - Golgi tendon organs.

On 17 March 2007, he scored his first ever career goal for Weymouth in a Conference National match against Southport. It was all the more remarkable as it was from his own penalty area, in the last minutes of the game, and was the winning goal. It was the first ever goal a Weymouth goalkeeper has scored from open play in the entire history of the club. Matthews made his Eastleigh debut in the 5–0 away win over Maidenhead United on 8 March 2008 before making his home debut a week later in the 4–1 home defeat at the hands of Hayes & Yeading United a week later.\\"Jason Matthews Signs for Eastleigh 7/3/2008\\" Adie Britton brought Matthews to Bath City on 22 June 2011.

In June 2013 Matthews returned to Weymouth on non contract terms for the 2013–14 season. When Brendon King was sacked he was made temporary Player/Manager at Weymouth. On 12 January 2014, Matthews was appointed player/manager on a full-time basis, after winning four of his seven games.

He studied dramatic and vocal art in Athens and from the beginning he was successful as actor and singer with international repertoire. Golden Medal for Merits of the Federal Land Vienna Georges Dimou was awarded with the \\"Golden Medal for Merits of the Federal Land Vienna\\" on 15 January 2003, an order for his intensive efforts for international understanding. Career He started as a singer in the Viennese Splendid Bar (Managed by Mr. Parker), Austria in 1958. Some years later, Georges became the owner of the Splendid Bar, arranging the successful musical programme by himself.

Life He was born in Dublin, the son of an Irish solicitor, and went to Rugby School in 1903 and then in 1907 to the University of Oxford, where he studied history. He entered the Indian Civil Service in 1911 and was posted to Burma in 1912. He had postings at Sagaing and elsewhere. In 1917, the British army raised a Burmese brigade with which Collis went to Palestine, but he saw no action. In 1919, he went on leave and travelled in Europe. In the 1920s he was district commissioner in Arakan. In 1929–1930, a period when relations between Burmese, Indians and British became particularly difficult, he was district magistrate in Rangoon. This period is narrated in his memoir Trials in Burma. He gives special attention to the political trial of J. M. Sen Gupta, mayor of Calcutta, for sedition in impromptu speeches made during a brief visit to Rangoon in 1930; also to two criminal trials which became politically charged because they brought to light underlying attitudes of British merchants and army officers to Burmese people. Collis's judgments were (according to his own analysis) too independent to be pleasing to the then British Government of Burma, arousing the particular disapproval of his superior, Booth Gravely, Commissioner of the Pegu Division. After giving judgment in the last of these trials Collis was hastily moved to the post of Excise Commissioner. After returning to England in 1934, he wrote many books, including Siamese White and Foreign Mud, as well as art and literary criticism. At the age of 65 he turned his hand to painting.

Boot Hill was the last film in a trilogy that started with God Forgives... I Don't! (1967), followed by Ace High (1968). The film was re- released as Trinity Rides Again. Plot One night in the Old West, a man named Cat tries to ride out of a town and is ambushed by a large number of men. He is wounded, but manages to lure them away and hides in a wagon belonging to a circus company. Outside town the wagons are searched by men who are shot by Cat and the trapeze artist Thomas, who is a former gunfighter. Cat leaves the company as soon as he can travel. The same night men arrive and search the wagons during the show and discover traces of him. To retaliate they shoot down Thomas’ partner Joe during their performance. Thomas finds Cat and nurses him back to health saying that he needs him as ”bait for my trap.” Cat takes him to Hutch, who lives in a house together with another big man, who is called Baby Doll and is a mute. Hutch receives Cat with hostility. Cat explains that Sharp, a friend of Hutch who is a prospector, needs help to stop mining boss Fisher from taking his claim, and that Cat had won the deed to the claim in a rigged poker game to be able to take it out of town (that is why he was attacked in the beginning). Hutch reluctantly agrees to come along, together with Baby Doll. They find the remnants of the circus with its manager Mami, refit it, and gather the artists. At the mining town a county commissioner arrives to review the claims, but the miners are afraid to talk to him – except for the McGavin family, but they are besieged in their home and eventually destroyed with dynamite by the large outlaw band of Finch, who co-operates with Fisher. However, at night a message is delivered to the commissioner in his room by a dwarf (from the circus). In the morning the circus arrives, and the commissioner convinces Fisher to invite everybody to the show. At the circus show they perform pantomimes about the threat to the miners and the killing of the McGavins. The miners find guns under their seats, while Fisher’s men find feathers. There is a fight and Fisher’s men are killed. The four go out to face the might of the Finch gang in a nightly fight. They get help from the circus people (including dwarves and can-can dancers), and eventually the miners also join in and the gang is wiped out. Fisher shoots Mami in the back. Cat appears and says it will render Fisher the gallows unless he wants to try his luck with the gun. Fisher lays it down and Mami says that makes him the real clown. At the end Cat and Hutch ride away together, while Baby Doll, who has started talking, stays with one of the can- can dancers at the circus.

Reception From retrospective reviews, in his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Bert Fridlund writes that all the Colizzi westerns present clever variations on several different kinds of partnerships encountered in other films inspired by For a Few Dollars More.

For an overview of the club itself, see Hereford United F.C. 1924–1945 Before the formation of Hereford United there were four leading amateur clubs in Hereford and it was believed that a higher class of football could be sustained if they were to amalgamate. After a meeting in the city, both Hereford City F.C. and Hereford Thistle F.C. decided to remain independent while St Martins and RAOC (Rotherwas) decided to merge, and thus Hereford United was formed in 1924 with Dr E.W. Maples as chairman. The new club joined the Birmingham Combination league and began playing their home matches at the local athletics ground on Edgar Street, where Hereford City also played their matches. The first competitive match was against Atherstone United in August 1924 which ended in a 2–3 defeat. The following week Hereford travelled to Kidderminster Harriers for an FA Cup Extra Preliminary Round, losing 2–7. Hereford spent four seasons in the Birmingham Combination League, with a best finish of 4th. The club was well-supported with gates of over 2,000 for the big matches. One of the most notable players of the early years was Viv Gregory who was a prolific goalscorer, scoring 60 goals in one season. Indeed, Hereford managed to score over 100 goals in the 1926–27 and 1927–28 seasons. Hereford were elected to the Birmingham League for the 1928–29 season by virtue of their impressive league performances and reaching the final of the Birmingham Senior Cup. They finished 11th in their first season and had a record attendance of 5,000 for their second successive cup final match, a record which stood for eighteen years. Hereford's average league finishing position was 8th in the first half of the 1930s. A highlight was reaching the FA Cup First Round for the first time in 1932–33, losing 1–2 to Accrington Stanley. By 1938–39 the standard of the Birmingham League had dropped with only 11 teams participating, and attendances at Edgar Street had also dropped. A public meeting was called and it was decided that the club would apply to join the Southern League, an application which was accepted. Subsequently, the club became a limited company. 1945–1966 Hereford's first season in the Southern League (1945–46) saw them finish second to Chelmsford City, a team who had been controversially awarded points for unplayed matches. Second place was again achieved in 1950–51 behind Merthyr Tydfil. In 1958–59 the Southern League was split into two sections: North-West and South-East. The winners of each section would contest a play-off to decide the winner of the league. Hereford won the North-West section but were beaten by Bedford Town in the play-off. A minor blip in 1964–65 saw the club relegated but this was quickly rectified with promotion the following season. Hereford's exploits in the FA Cup were steady performances to the First Round on several occasions before they reached the Second Round for the first time in 1948–49, losing 2–1 to Exeter. In fact Hereford managed to reach the Second Round six times in nine seasons. 1958–59 saw them reach the Third Round for the first time, quite an achievement for a Southern League club. In the Second Round they had defeated QPR 6–1 which was a record win by a non-league club over a league club at the time. Hereford played Sheffield Wednesday at Edgar Street in front of a record crowd of 18,114 but lost 3–0. This is still the highest attendance ever for the club. Hereford did not reach the Third Round again until 1965–66 where they were defeated 2–1 by Bedford Town. 1966–1986 Hereford finally won election to the Football League in 1971–72, after finishing second in the league, largely thanks to their excellent FA Cup run. The club's most famous cup run came in the 1971–72 season when they played ten FA Cup matches, of which five were replays. In the Second Round it took Hereford two replays to defeat Northampton but the team waiting for them in the Third Round was none other than Newcastle of the First Division. Newcastle were held 2–2 at St James' Park before the replay at Edgar Street, which was covered by the BBC. Newcastle scored after 82 minutes through Malcolm Macdonald but then Ronnie Radford scored a 30-yard screamer at the Meadow End to make it 1–1, prompting a pitch invasion. Hereford had brought on Ricky George just minutes before, and it was George who scored the winner in extra time. Hereford had reached the Fourth Round for the first time in their history and their next opponents would be again First Division standard in the form of West Ham United. After a 0–0 draw at Edgar Street, the Bulls were finally knocked out of the FA Cup in the replay at Upton Park, losing 3–1 thanks to a Geoff Hurst hat-trick. Radford's goal subsequently became one of the most famous and televised goals ever and, coupled with the commentary of John Motson, it was voted Goal of the Season. In 2002, it ranked 97th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. Until recently the goal was featured in the opening credits for Match of the Day and the feat is always referred to by commentators and pundits when the FA Cup comes round each year. In their first season in the Football League Hereford finished runners-up to Southport in the Fourth Division and were promoted to the Third Division. The next two seasons saw Hereford finish eighteenth and twelfth before taking the Third Division title in 1975–76 – the club's greatest honour. However the following season saw Hereford finish bottom of the Second Division and they were relegated. The club were again relegated from the Third Division the following season and so were back in the Fourth Division for the 1978–79 season. Hereford were to remain in this division for the next nineteen seasons. The club generally finished the seasons in minor positions (including seventeenth for five consecutive seasons) and even had to apply for re-election to the League in 1979–80, 1980–81 and 1982–83. 1984–85 was a better season for Hereford when they finished 5th. 1986–2006 =Decline and relegation= The 1989–90 season again saw a mediocre performance in the league, with the club again finishing 17th. They were more successful in the Cup competitions, particularly the Welsh Cup which became the club's first major silverware for 14 years. They scored nine goals past Connah's Quay Nomads in Round 3, where Paul Burton became the youngest Hereford player to score a hat-trick, at the age of 16. After wins over Kidderminster Harriers and Bangor City, they beat rivals Cardiff City 3–0 at Ninian Park in the first leg of the semi-final, before holding on in the return at Edgar Street to reach the final for the first time since 1981. On 13 May 1990 they met Wrexham at Cardiff Arms Park and won 2–1, thanks to an 84th-minute winner from Ian Benbow. In the FA Cup, Hereford reached the Fourth Round for the first time in eight years, after a memorable victory over Walsall. With three minutes left on the clock, Hereford were 1–0 down but a penalty drew them level, then long-serving player Mel Pejic scored the winner in the 89th minute. The reward was a home tie against Manchester United, who were then 15th in the First Division. In front of the last five figure crowd at Edgar Street to date, Hereford were defeated by a Clayton Blackmore 84th-minute winner. This relieved the pressure of dismissal that manager Alex Ferguson was reported to be under at the time, and the Red Devils went on to win the Cup that season.Hereford out to add to their Little Book of FA Cup Shocks Guardian Unlimited, 25 January 2008.

The early part of the 1990s saw little progress in terms of the club's Football League position, with seventeenth position being attained on no less than five consecutive occasions, under five different managers. Indeed, both Colin Addison and John Sillett were brought back for a season each in an attempt to revive the club, with little success. However the club managed to hit form under Graham Turner, who joined at the beginning of the 1995–96 season. In early 1996 the club mounted a challenge for promotion when they went from nineteenth position to sixth position in two months, securing an unlikely play-off place. However they were unable to sustain this form in the play-offs, losing over two legs to Darlington. The season was also notable for the fact that Steve White, with 29 goals, was the highest league goalscorer in the top four divisions of English football thus emulating Dixie McNeil who achieved the same feat twenty years previously. The season that followed, 1996–97, saw a complete reverse in the club's fortunes. With debts mounting and the club having made a loss of over £300,000, Turner was forced to sell key players such as White and Richard Wilkins. A terrible run of form when the club went three months without a win meant they were sucked into the relegation dogfight. Brighton & Hove Albion, with their own well documented troubles, had seemed destined for relegation for much of the season. But they climbed above Hereford on the penultimate day of the season, leaving the Bulls 24th and bottom of the entire Football League. Both teams were level on points, and Hereford had a better goal difference, but the goals scored rule was in effect and Brighton had scored more goals. On 3 May 1997 the two clubs met in a relegation decider at Edgar Street, which was the subject of considerable media interest as one club would relegate the other. Hereford needed a win to survive while Brighton only required a draw thanks to their having scored more goals. A capacity crowd saw Hereford take the lead in the first half through an own goal by Kerry Mayo from Tony Agana's cross. Brighton equalised in the second half against the run of play through Robbie Reinelt, who snapped up the rebound after a shot crashed against the post. In the last minute Hereford had a chance to save themselves but leading scorer Adrian Foster shot weakly at the goalkeeper when one-on-one. The final whistle blew and Hereford were relegated after 25 years in the Football League. Graham Turner subsequently resigned as manager but withdrew his resignation after strong support from the board and supporters. The general belief around the club at the time was that the club were merely 'on loan' to the Conference, but it would prove to be a long road back. =Financial crisis in the Conference= By May 1997 the club had severe financial problems with debts of over £1 million, and a sizeable list of creditors. Chairman Peter Hill and the board secured two loans of £500,000 from a developing company to pay off some but not all of the creditors. As part of the arrangement control of the two leases on the Edgar Street stadium was also passed to the developers. By November 1997 matters off the field overshadowed the team's performances with the club in crisis with running costs mounting up and wages unpaid. Eventually a Company Voluntary Agreement was proposed to avoid the club being wound up by creditors, including the Inland Revenue to whom over £140,000 was owed alone. When Hill walked away from the club at the end of the 1997–98 season, Graham Turner bought the majority shareholding and took on the burden of the debt, along with Joan Fennessy. Had he not bought the shares it is likely the club would have gone under as nobody else came forward to take control of the club. On the pitch Hereford could only finish sixth in their first Conference season with the highlights being double wins over rivals Kidderminster Harriers and Cheltenham Town. Most notably a run to the FA Cup Third Round saw a memorable triumph over Brighton at Edgar Street which was featured on Match of the Day. The terms of the CVA prevented Graham Turner from purchasing any players, and the dire financial situation meant any reasonable offers for players had to be accepted. A prime example was Neil Grayson, top scorer with 16 goals in that first Conference season, who was sold to Cheltenham in March 1998 after only seven months at the club. Grayson was also the last player to have been purchased for a fee by Hereford as he had arrived before the CVA came into effect. Another notable sale was that of Gavin Mahon who was sold to Brentford midway through the following season. Mahon had been an ever-present in the side and his transfer eventually earned £130,000 for the club. The club relied heavily on decent runs in the cup competitions during these bleak financial seasons, and in 1999–00 they progressed to the FA Cup Third Round again. Having disposed of Burgess Hill, York City and Hartlepool United, they drew then Premiership side Leicester City at Edgar Street, which was again a feature match on Match of the Day. Leicester fielded their first team which featured the likes of Tim Flowers, Emile Heskey and Robbie Savage against a Hereford side that featured part-time goalkeeper Mark Jones (a farmer), midfielder John Snape (an electrician) and striker Rob Elmes (a teacher). Hereford forced a replay after a 0–0 draw although they came close to winning after Paul Parry, who had come through the youth system at Hereford, shot against the post with Flowers beaten. In the replay at Filbert Street Hereford took a shock lead in the first half through Paul Fewings. Leicester recovered to equalise through Matt Elliott and the match went into extra time. Leicester then went a man down after an injury to Andy Impey but Hereford had tired and could not capitalise on their advantage. In the second half of extra time Leicester scored the winning goal through Muzzy Izzet but Hereford again came close to forcing penalties when Gavin Williams nearly converted Ian Wright's header. A run to the semi-final of the FA Trophy in 2000–01 also helped the finances. At the start of the 2001–02 season Hereford's future looked bleak, with debts of over £1.2 million owed to developers who also held the lease on Edgar Street. It seemed as though the only option to repay the debt was the redevelopment of Edgar Street and at the time, it looked as if the club would have to relocate. After a humiliating 4–1 defeat to Hayes, Graham Turner stepped down as manager to concentrate on more pressing financial issues. Player-coach Phil Robinson assumed managerial responsibilities and Hereford managed to have another run in the FA Cup. In the Fourth Qualifying Round Hereford were drawn away at Dover and came away with a 1–0 win, Gavin Williams scoring the priceless goal. The First Round match at home to Wrexham was televised live on the BBC and the money earned from this fixture kept the club alive. Graham Turner has said that had Hereford not beaten Dover, they would probably have not made it into 2002. Hereford eventually finished seventeenth in the Conference after briefly being drawn into the relegation dogfight, Phil Robinson scoring the goal that guaranteed safety in the 1–0 win over Dagenham. =The journey back to the Football League= Major changes were made for the 2002–03 season as only six players were retained. With the chance to completely rebuild the squad and the prospect of two promotion places to the League, Graham Turner decided to remain at the club despite handing in his resignation to the board along with company secretary Joan Fennessy. The team he assembled showed great promise, finishing sixth just outside the play-offs. An excellent start was made to the 2003–04 season with the club heading the table in the first part of the season, before three costly defeats and the distraction of cup competitions eroded the advantage. Chester City took up the lead in the table which they would lose only briefly on their way to the Conference title, which they claimed in their penultimate match. Both clubs had a faultless run-in to the end of the season, with Hereford winning 11 straight matches; the first being a 9–0 televised away win at Dagenham & Redbridge, and the eleventh coming against Chester on the final day of the season in front of Hereford's largest Conference home attendance. It was Hereford's best season statistically in the Conference, but key home defeats to Leigh RMI, Woking, Tamworth and Burton had proved very costly indeed with Hereford finishing just one point behind Chester with 91 points, 28 wins, 103 goals and a goal difference of 59. This counted for little in the play-offs where Hereford were eliminated by Aldershot Town on penalties in the semi- finals, playing with ten men for 100 minutes of the match after a controversial red card for Andrew Tretton. 2004–05 again ended in failure in the play-offs with the club having lost striker Steve Guinan, midfielder Ben Smith, full back Michael Rose and goalkeeper Matt Baker to Football League clubs. This time it was Stevenage Borough who disposed of the Conference runners-up although Hereford only moved into 2nd position on the final day of the season, eventually finishing on 74 points while Barnet were running away with the Conference title. The club did enjoy extended runs in the Football League Trophy and FA Trophy competitions. Another positive was the settling of the CVA in September 2004, the club finally turning the corner financially. The 2005–06 season saw Hereford finally secure promotion via the play-offs after a third consecutive 2nd place, despite an indifferent first half of the season averaging seventh position. The turning point was the introduction of local teenager Andy Williams which led to a 16 match unbeaten run in the league. Indeed, from the start of December to the end of the season, Hereford were only beaten once in the league. Notable comebacks in the league against Grays Athletic and champions Accrington Stanley helped preserve the best defensive record in the Conference, with six defeats and just 33 league goals conceded all season. The play-off campaign started identically to the previous two seasons with Hereford drawing 1–1 away, this time to Morecambe. In the home leg the match went into extra time with the scores level at 2–2, after three goals in the opening twelve minutes. Guy Ipoua scored the winner in the 107th minute sparking a pitch invasion, and setting up a showdown against Halifax Town in the final at Walker's Stadium, Leicester. Approximately 10,000 of the 15,499 attendance were Hereford supporters who saw their team win promotion after a 3–2 win. Halifax took the lead twice in normal time only to be pegged back twice; by Williams' diving header in the first half and substitute Ipoua, with ten minutes to go to force extra time. The winner came in the 109th minute from full back Ryan Green, and sealed Hereford's return to the Football League after nine years of Conference football. 2006–2014 Hereford's first season back in the Football League saw them beat five of the top eight finishing clubs, as well as higher graded opposition in the cup competitions. The surprise result of the season was a 4–1 win at Lincoln City with Steve Guinan, back on loan, scoring a hat-trick. This lifted the Bulls to 9th in League Two but their remaining thirteen fixtures saw them collect just seven more points, which meant they eventually finished in 16th position. This late season poor form meant that the bookmakers tipped the Bulls to be favourites for relegation in 2007–08. However, from November onwards the Bulls were rarely out of the top 4 in League Two, with their squad bolstered by a number of successful loan signings. In particular the signing of Gary Hooper, who scored 11 goals in 19 matches, proved the catalyst to an eventual third- place finish and automatic promotion. A run to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup equalled the club's best performance in that competition, losing 2–1 to eventual finalists Cardiff City in front of a capacity crowd at Edgar Street. The success of the season was underlined by the news, announced in March 2009, that the club had made a profit of over £400,000. Hereford's 2008–09 season saw them playing in the third tier of English football for the first time in 30 years. With only one player signed for a transfer fee, Graham Turner again relied heavily on the loan market; attracting players such as Bruno N'Gotty and Matt Murray, as well as youngsters from both Manchester United and Liverpool. The season saw them struggle to compete against better funded and supported clubs; by mid-October they were bottom with only six points. Patches of good form in mid-seasons saw them threaten to escape the relegation zone, but five consecutive defeats in March have made survival increasingly difficult. Manager Jamie Pitman was sacked in March 2012 following a poor run of form. In the 2011–12 season, Hereford were relegated from League Two on the last day of the season, despite beating Torquay United 3–2. =Back to the Conference & difficulties= Hereford will play in the Conference National in the 2012–13 season. Hereford were expelled from the Conference on 10 June 2014 due to financial irregularities. It was revealed a week later that the club's debts could total as much as £1.3million. The club was accepted into the Southern League Premier Division for the 2014–15 season on 19 June 2014. However financial worries continue, including a winding-up petition started by Martin Foyle, who resigned as Manager in March 2014. Hearings of the winding- up petition have been adjourned a number of times, including on 7 July 2014. A number of other creditors have attached themselves to the Foyle petition, including Andy Porter, former Assistant Manager, and HMRC. A CVA was proposed by the Board of Directors of the company, but was rejected by creditors. Many Hereford fans have chosen to boycott the club due to clashes between the fans and the board. Many fans feel anger over the board's choice to not pay a bond to remain in the Conference Premier and other management choices that the fans feel are not in the club's best interests. On 10 December 2014, after failing to fully and properly comply with obligations to respond to questions coming from an Independent Regulatory Commission, the FA suspended Hereford United from all forms of football activity with immediate effect, until the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission has been complied with to the full satisfaction of the Commission. Hereford United's suspension from all football activity was lifted by the Football Association the following day, after Chairman, and new majority shareholder, Andy Lonsdale confirmed the FA received the necessary documentation – including the transfer of shares in the club to Lonsdale. =End of the club= The 90-year-old club ceased to exist when it was wound-up in the High Court on 19 December 2014. A phoenix club Hereford F.C. was formed in 2015 and is now playing in the Southern Football League South and West division. References History of Hereford United F.C. Hereford United F.C.

Rugby union  Ballesty was schooled at St.Patrick's College Strathfield, at the time they played rugby league not rugby union. He left school and initially played rugby union for Sydney Teachers College (STC). On mass a group of STC players joined Eastwood rugby culminating in a grand final loss in 1966 against a strong Randwick team brimming with Wallabies including Ken Catchpole. Ballesty was Eastwood's first Wallaby test player and the third Australian national representative to come from the Eastwood Rugby Club when he debuted against the All Blacks in Sydney in June 1968. Ballesty had replaced Wallaby great Phil Hawthorne who had switched to rugby league and the St. George Dragons. That test All Black great Coin Meads tore the hamstring of Wallaby great Ken Catchpole. The injury so severe it prematurely retired Catchpole from the game and he never played again. That same year he kicked the match winning field goal in a Test match against the France. He played in 9 tests between 1968 and 1969 for the Wallabies at fly-half before switching codes. He captained Australia in three minor matches in 1969.Howell p13  Rugby league  In 1970 Ballesty joined the Eastern Suburbs club alongside former Wallaby team mates John Brass and Alan Cardy. In 1972 he was a try-scorer in the Roosters side that lost to Manly Warringah in that year's Grand final and he received the Player of the Year award from Australian rugby league's major publication, Rugby League Week. In 1972 former Wallaby and current kangaroo Phil Hawthorne joined the Roosters but Ballesty kept Hawthorne in reserve grade. While at Easts he trained in club management before leaving to play for the Queanbeyan Blues under his Roosters coach Don Furner at the end of the 1973 season. Ballesty played NSW Country Firsts 1975-77, in 1975 when City-Country wasn't origin based but where you played, Country defeated City 19-9 in a great upset. Country was led by past Sydney premiership players Jim Morgan and Ballesty. Future star Michael Cronin kicked 5 goals. The City side contained 4 players later named in the team of the century Graeme Langlands, Robert Fulton, Ron Coote and Arthur Beetson. ountry never defeated City again until the rules were changed to origin of birth. Much like the State teams in rugby league. Playing in the country meant Ballesty wasn't seen by state and national selectors regularly enough to be picked. He retired in 1979. Whiticker/Hudson \\"The Encyclopedia Of Rugby League Players (1995 Edition) () Ballesty returned to the Eastwood Rugby Union Club in 1980 where he held the role of Secretary-Manager and coach for two years. In that time he lifted Eastwood into First Division with the help of young future Wallabies Brett Papworth and Steve Tuynman. Papworth later mirrored Ballesty's career leaving Eastwood to join the Roosters. In 1982 Ballesty joined the Canterbury Bankstown Leagues Club in 1982 as General Manager. At the time the Bulldogs were close to insolvency and the team on the brink of folding. By 2000 it was financially Australia's largest single licensed club. He is married with 4 children, Martin, Brendan, Scott and Kate. In 2018 Ballesty returned to the Bulldogs as a director of the football club.

In September 2007, he was appointed to lead an investigation into human rights violations in Darfur. In July 2013 he resigned as Governor of South Kordofan, and was reappointed by Omar al-Bashir as Governor of North Kordofan. On 1 March 2019, President Omar al-Bashir handed over the running of the country's leading political party, the National Congress, to him.

Despite international calls for his arrest, Haroun continued to serve as minister of state for humanitarian affairs (which is a post below the full ministerial level). In this role, Haroun oversaw Darfur's two million internally displaced persons. Aid agencies have accused him of hindering their efforts to bring relief to the displaced. In September 2007, the Sudanese government announced that Haroun would lead an investigation into human rights abuses in Darfur.

A commutative monoid M is conical, if x+y=0 implies that x=y=0, for any elements x,y of M.  Basic examples  A join-semilattice with zero is a refinement monoid if and only if it is distributive. Any abelian group is a refinement monoid. The positive cone G+ of a partially ordered abelian group G is a refinement monoid if and only if G is an interpolation group, the latter meaning that for any elements a0, a1, b0, b1 of G such that ai ≤ bj for all i, j<2, there exists an element x of G such that ai ≤ x ≤ bj for all i, j<2\\\\. This holds, for example, in case G is lattice-ordered. The isomorphism type of a Boolean algebra B is the class of all Boolean algebras isomorphic to B. (If we want this to be a set, restrict to Boolean algebras of set- theoretical rank below the one of B.) The class of isomorphism types of Boolean algebras, endowed with the addition defined by [X]+[Y]=[X\\\\times Y] (for any Boolean algebras X and Y, where [X] denotes the isomorphism type of X), is a conical refinement monoid.  Vaught measures on Boolean algebras  For a Boolean algebra A and a commutative monoid M, a map μ : A → M is a measure, if μ(a)=0 if and only if a=0, and μ(a ∨ b)=μ(a)+μ(b) whenever a and b are disjoint (that is, a ∧ b=0), for any a, b in A. We say in addition that μ is a Vaught measure (after Robert Lawson Vaught), or V-measure, if for all c in A and all x,y in M such that μ(c)=x+y, there are disjoint a, b in A such that c=a ∨ b, μ(a)=x, and μ(b)=y. An element e in a commutative monoid M is measurable (with respect to M), if there are a Boolean algebra A and a V-measure μ : A → M such that μ(1)=e---we say that μ measures e. We say that M is measurable, if any element of M is measurable (with respect to M). Of course, every measurable monoid is a conical refinement monoid. Hans Dobbertin proved in 1983 that any conical refinement monoid with at most ℵ1 elements is measurable. He also proved that any element in an at most countable conical refinement monoid is measured by a unique (up to isomorphism) V-measure on a unique at most countable Boolean algebra. He raised there the problem whether any conical refinement monoid is measurable. This was answered in the negative by Friedrich Wehrung in 1998. The counterexamples can have any cardinality greater than or equal to ℵ2.  Nonstable K-theory of von Neumann regular rings  For a ring (with unit) R, denote by FP(R) the class of finitely generated projective right R-modules. Equivalently, the objects of FP(R) are the direct summands of all modules of the form Rn, with n a positive integer, viewed as a right module over itself. Denote by [X] the isomorphism type of an object X in FP(R). Then the set V(R) of all isomorphism types of members of FP(R), endowed with the addition defined by [X]+[Y]=[X\\\\times Y], is a conical commutative monoid. In addition, if R is von Neumann regular, then V(R) is a refinement monoid. It has the order-unit [R]. We say that V(R) encodes the nonstable K-theory of R. For example, if R is a division ring, then the members of FP(R) are exactly the finite-dimensional right vector spaces over R, and two vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Hence V(R) is isomorphic to the monoid \\\\mathbb{Z}^+=\\\\\\\\{0,1,2,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\} of all natural numbers, endowed with its usual addition. A slightly more complicated example can be obtained as follows. A matricial algebra over a field F is a finite product of rings of the form F^{n\\\\times n}=ring of all square matrices with n rows and entries in F, for variable positive integers n. A direct limit of matricial algebras over F is a locally matricial algebra over F. Every locally matricial algebra is von Neumann regular. For any locally matricial algebra R, V(R) is the positive cone of a so-called dimension group. By definition, a dimension group is a partially ordered abelian group whose underlying order is directed, whose positive cone is a refinement monoid, and which is unperforated, the letter meaning that mx≥0 implies that x≥0, for any element x of G and any positive integer m. Any simplicial group, that is, a partially ordered abelian group of the form \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, is a dimension group. Effros, Handelman, and Shen proved in 1980 that dimension groups are exactly the direct limits of simplicial groups, where the transition maps are positive homomorphisms. This result had already been proved in 1976, in a slightly different form, by P.A. Grillet. Elliott proved in 1976 that the positive cone of any countable direct limit of simplicial groups is isomorphic to V(R), for some locally matricial ring R. Finally, Goodearl and Handelman proved in 1986 that the positive cone of any dimension group with at most ℵ1 elements is isomorphic to V(R), for some locally matricial ring R (over any given field). Wehrung proved in 1998 that there are dimension groups with order-unit whose positive cone cannot be represented as V(R), for a von Neumann regular ring R. The given examples can have any cardinality greater than or equal to ℵ2. Whether any conical refinement monoid with at most ℵ1 (or even ℵ0) elements can be represented as V(R) for R von Neumann regular is an open problem.  References  * H.

Carbon nanobuds were discovered and synthesized in 2006. In this material, fullerenes are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying nanotube. Consequently, nanobuds exhibit properties of both carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. For instance, the mechanical properties and the electrical conductivity of the nanobuds are similar to those of corresponding carbon nanotubes. However, because of the higher reactivity of the attached fullerene molecules, the hybrid material can be further functionalized through known fullerene chemistry. Additionally, the attached fullerene molecules can be used as molecular anchors to prevent slipping of the nanotubes in various composite materials, thus modifying the composite’s mechanical properties. Owing to the large number of highly curved fullerene surfaces acting as electron emission sites on conductive carbon nanotubes, nanobuds possess advantageous field electron emission characteristics. Randomly oriented nanobuds have already been demonstrated to have an extremely low work function for field electron emission. Reported test measurements show (macroscopic) field thresholds of about 0.65 V/μm, (non-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes have a macroscopic field threshold for field electron emission ~2 V/μm) and a much higher current density as compared with that of the corresponding pure single-walled carbon nanotubes. The electron transport properties of certain nanobud classes have been treated theoretically. The study shows that electrons indeed pass to the neck and bud region of the nanobud system. Canatu Oy, a Finnish company, claims the intellectual property rights for nanobud material, its synthesis processes, and several applications. Properties Carbon nanobuds (CNBs) have some properties of carbon nanotubes such as one-dimensional electrical conductivity, flexibility and adaptability to manufacture while also having some chemical properties of fullerenes. Examples of these properties include engaging in cycloaddition reactions and can easily form the chemical bonds capable of attaching to other molecules with complex structures. CNBs have a much higher chemical activity than single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).Albert G. Nasibulin Ilya V. Anoshkin, Prasantha R. Mudimela, Janne Raula, Vladimir Ermolov, Esko I. Kauppinen, \\"Selective Chemical Functionalization of Carbon Nanobuds,\\" Carbon 50, no. 11 (2012). = Electrical Properties = This new structure has been shown to have electronic properties that differ from those of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNBs exhibit lower field thresholds and higher current densities and electric field emission than SWCNTs. The chemical bonds between the nanotube's wall and the fullerenes on the surface can lead to charge transfer between the surfaces. The presence of fullerenes in CNBs lead to smaller bundle formation and larger chemical reactivity. CNBs can engage in cycloaddiiton reactions and easily form the chemical bonds capable of attaching molecules with complex structures. this can be explained by a greater availability of CNB surface to the reactants the presence of π-conjugated structures, and having 5-atom rings with excess pirimidization energy. Formation energy indicated that preparation of CNBs is endothermic, meaning that it is not favorable to create. All CNBs are conducting, regardless of whether the single walled CNT is a metallic or semiconducting base. The band gap of carbon nanobuds is not constant, it can change through the size of the fullerene group. The attachment of C60 added to the armchair orientation of the SWCNT opens up the band gap. On the other hand, adding it to a semiconducting SWCNT could introduce impurity states to the band gap, which would reduce the band gap. The band gap of CNBs can also be modified by changing the density of the carbons of the C60 attached to the sidewall of the SWCNT.Xiaojun Wu and Xiao Cheng Zeng, \\"First-Principles Study of a Carbon Nanobud,\\" ACS Nano 2, no. 7 (2008) = Magnetic Properties = Geometrical factors are integral to study the magnetic properties of nanobuds. There are two structures of CNBs that are ferromagnetic in their ground state, and two that are nonmagnetic.Min Wang and Chang Ming Li, \\"Magnetic Properties of All- Carbon Graphene-Fullerene Nanobuds,\\" Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 13, no. 13 (2011). The attached C60 molecule on the surface of the CNTs gives more space between the nanotubes and adhesion between the single walled CNTS can be weakened to prevent the formation of tight bundles of CNTs. Carbon nanobuds can be used as molecular support to prevent slipping of the matrix in composite materials and to increase the mechanical strength of them. = Structural Properties = The stability of CNBs is dependent on the type of carbon-carbon bond that is dissociated in the cycloaddition reaction. It has been shown that carbon atoms of the SWCNT near the fullerene C60 molecule were pulled outward from the original wall surface due to the covalent bonding with cycloaddition reaction between the fullerene and nanotube; in addition, their bonding was transformed from sp2 to sp3 hybridization. An analysis using Raman scattering spectroscopy shows that the CNB sample had stronger chemical modification compared to CNTs. This indicates that there is a carbon sp3 hybridization that occurs after the chemical addition creation of CNBs. Synthesis The single wall carbon nanotubes, SWCNTs, are capable of being covered with covalently bonded fullerenes (a specific type of spheroidal carbon). This was able to occur when water vapor or carbon dioxide concentrations were instituted into the reactor. This occurrence produces a material that looks similar to buds that are on a tree branch. Therefore, this is the reasoning behind the term, nanobud, being chosen for the material.Anisimov, Anton. \\"Aerosol Synthesis of Carbon Nanotubes and Nanobuds.\\". (2010). The vapor concentrations for the water and the density of the fullerenes were looked into with a lot more detail. At 45 ppm and higher, the nanobuds began to be formed in abundance. However, when the concentration for the water that was added was about 365 ppm, something different happened. Rather than being a significant amount of nanobuds, it contained a large amount of inactive catalyst particles. Characterization There are multiple methods that were used in order to discover the fullerenes on the single wall carbon nanotube surfaces, each giving its own contribution to what is currently known about nanobuds. A few of these methods are ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). To look even further into the functionality of CNBs and how the single wall carbon nanotubes interact with the fullerenes to produce the nanobuds, calculations were done. The calculations that were done came from the atomistic density functional theory (quantum mechanical modelling method) and gave quite a bit of information about the bonding that is taking place. They told the scientists that there seem to be two possibilities for the interaction. One of the possibilities is that the fullerenes can be covalently bonded to the single wall carbon nanotubes directly. The other possibility is that the fullerenes are forming hybrid structures. Regardless of how they are bonding to the single wall nanotubes, studies have shown that the fullerenes are stationary and do not seem to want to move from the interaction with the nanotubes, concluding that the bond they have is very strong. This study was done using transmission electron microscopy. Another study was done to see how washing the nanobuds in different solvents, such as toluene, decaline, and hexane, would affect the fullerenes and their interaction with the nanotubes. Of the solvents that were tested, none of them resulted in fullerenes being dissolved in the solvent. This continues to defend the discovery that the bond between the two is significantly strong. In one more additional study that was done, it was discovered that each of the nanobud samples contained oxygen. Applications The research, development, and manufacture of flexible and transparent electronics relies on novel materials, or materials which are mechanically flexible, lightweight and relatively low cost. These materials must also be conductive and optically transparent. Due to their close relation to the carbon nanotube family, carbon NanoBuds offer all of those traits, as well as more due to their inclusion of fullerene. Esko Kauppinen, a professor and researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology and the technology development organization VTT Biotechnology, and his team found that carbon NanoBuds have properties that are often associated with cold electron field emitters. Such materials emit electrons at room temperature under a high applied electric field, a property that is very important with regard to technologies such as flat-panel displays and electron microscopes. Carbon NanoBuds can be much more effective than flat surfaces with respect to how efficiently they can emit electrons. This is due to the many curved surfaces of both the fullerene and the carbon nanotube that make up the carbon NanoBud. As a result of the curvature of the fullerenes and the nanotubes, almost any surface could potentially be transformed into a surface with touch sensing ability. Canatu, a company which specializes in electronic carbon NanoBud products, claims that the films that result from the synthesis of the NanoBuds are very rugged and flexible. They also claim that the NanoBuds allow for easy application to flexible and curved surfaces. NanoBuds are able to maintain their electronic capabilities while being bent up to 200 percent. This property is a result of the rounded surfaces, which allow the NanoBuds to slide past each other without damaging the electronic structure of the material. Typically, touch screen surfaces are made by placing a sheet of indium tin oxide, also a transparent film, over a display screen. However, indium tin oxide sheets are very brittle like glass and can only be applied to relatively flat surfaces in order to maintain the integrity of the structure. As a result of their close lineage with carbon nanotubes, NanoBuds have a tunable electrical conductivity. Since the electrical properties of the NanoBuds can be individually tuned (provided that single wall nanotubes with distinct regions of different electrical properties are a part of the NanoBud), according to Esko Kauppinen and his team, it is entirely possible that NanoBuds may at some point be used in applications such as memory storage devices and quantum dots. The Kauppinen team argues that the conductivity of the crystalline carbon structure allow for this application. In fact, the small size of carbon nanotubes and carbon NanoBuds, in theory, allow for a very high density of energy storage. The most common memory technology that is associated with carbon NanoBuds is Nano random-access memory (NRAM), or Nano- RAM. This technology is a type of nonvolatile random access memory, but it is based on the position of carbon nanotubes, or in this case, carbon NanoBuds on a chip like substrate. Its developing company Nantero give it its common name, NRAM. When compared to other forms of nonvolatile random access memory, NanoRAM has several advantages, but one really stands out. NRAM is believed to be within a variety of new memory systems, a variety which many people believe to be universal. Nantero claims that Nano-RAM (NRAM) could eventually replace almost all memory systems from flash to DRAM to SRAM.

It was originally formed as the Marine Aircraft Experimental Station in October 1918 at RAF Isle of Grain, a former Royal Naval Air Service seaplane base, to design, test and evaluate seaplanes, flying boats and other aircraft with a naval connection. It was renamed as the Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment on 16 March 1920 to recognise that weapons and other equipment were evaluated as well as complete aircraft. It was renamed again on 1 March 1924 as the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment. Relocations On 16 June 1924 the Establishment moved to the site of the former Seaplane Experimental Station seaplane base at Felixstowe. It carried out research and development work on water-based aircraft for service needs and also on their equipment and on air-sea rescue apparatus. The Establishment's work grew during its early years and by 1930 it was carrying out acceptance tests and trials on flying boats, seaplanes, and their associated equipment and armaments. With the start of the Second World War the Establishment was moved to the more secure and safer location of Helensburgh in Scotland, and in 1940 was put under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production.The National Archives, Air Ministry and successors: Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment: Reports, In addition to its earlier functions the Establishment became responsible for acceptance tests and trials of air-sea rescue apparatus and equipment and for aircraft armament research with bombs, depth charges and projectiles, including experiments and tests in water tanks. Being the sole official experimental establishment for marine aircraft in the country, particular emphasis was placed on research, especially into seaworthiness, stability and control on water, and water impact loads. In August 1945, the MAEE returned to Felixstowe, and soon after came under the Ministry of Supply, which was taking control of most military research establishments. Reduced interest in flying boats meant the link with the Royal Air Force ended in 1953, when flying ended. From then the Establishment was responsible for testing and evaluating prototype marine craft and air-sea rescue apparatus and associated equipment to determine whether they complied with the development specifications and to advise when they could be handed over for Service trials. The MAEE was closed down in March 1956, its remaining activities being moved to the Air Ministry and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down.

The Finnish army, under the command of General Carl Johan Adlercreutz defeated a smaller Russian force and drove it southwards. It was the last in a string of Swedish successes during the summer of 1808, and marked the turning point in the war. Prelude With his supply lines harassed by Swedish forces and retreating southward, the newly appointed general major Nikolay Kamensky decided to retake the initiative. The logistical situation precluded this however, and he was forced to march to Jämsä. Not until 7 August was he able to regain control of the situation, as Swedish raiding activities ebbed and reinforcements and fresh supplies started arriving. Kamenskiy then decided to renew his offensive. He sent a detachment under colonel Erikson toward Alavus and marched towards Jyväskylä. Probably encouraged by the victory at Kauhajoki, marshal Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor ordered general Adlercreutz to attack the Russian position at Alavus. The army, much worn by the ordeals of the summer, was moved south on 16 August in pouring rain. The following day the weather cleared. The battle In bright sunshine, Adlercreutz attacked the Russian positions south of the Alavus church, near the small village of Härkölä, protected by lake Alajärvi (now Alavudenjärvi or Kirkkojärvi) on his left and marshy ground on his right. The Russian counterattacked on their right wing and forced a battalion of Karelians on the Swedish left flank to retreat northwards. At this point Adlercreutz ordered the 3rd battalion of Savolax infantry regiment, supported by the 2nd battalion, to counterattack. After a barrage of gunfire, the battalion made a bayonet charge and threw back the Russians. The Russian left flank was also under pressure and started yielding; by 19.00 the entire Russian force had retired with casualties tallying 370 men, compared to 200 on the Swedish side. Aftermath Despite the success, Klingspor never capitalized on it or the outcome of Lapua and the difficult Russian supply situation in the summer of 1808.

History Kilnamanagh, in Irish 'Cill na Manach', translates to 'Church of the Monks', referring to the church and castle established to house Saint Kevin and his followers. Present day Kilnamanagh has close ties to Glendalough, the other resting place of St Kevin. Unfortunately, the ancient Church of St. Kevin and castle located in Kilnamanagh were destroyed when the building of the housing estate commenced in 1974 by unscrupulous developers who were insensitive to the rich historical heritage which resided there. The well that was built by St. Kevin is now covered up, but there is still a small garden around the well for people to visit. The well and garden have been fenced in for fear of desecration. The gates are locked and access is controlled by the local church. There are many references to St. Kevin and his followers in Kilnamanagh; the school, church and local sports teams are named after him. During the 1980s, many annual community events were held in the parish including the Sunday Fete and the annual cycle pilgrimage to Glendalough. People Former Dublin Senior footballer and current Westmeath Senior Gaelic Football team manager Paul Bealin began his career playing for St Kevin's GAA in the 1980s. Church St. Kevin's Church was built in 1978, and over the years the adjoining presbytery has been residence for many priests which have included the following: * Fr. Donal O'Scanaill, P.P. * Fr. Ernest Neville, P.P. * Fr. Pearce McLoughlin, C.C. * Fr. Oliver Hanratty, C.C. * Father Curran, P.P * Father James Fingleton, P.P. Modern suburb Kilnamanagh was one of the largest housing estates in Europe at the time it was built by Tom Brennan and Joseph McGowan, who traded as Kilnamanagh Estates. It is still the largest private housing estate in Europe, consisting of 1,600 houses. On release to the market, the first tranche of 3-bedroom semi-detached houses were priced at £5,995. Kilnamanagh has a primary school (St. Kevin's), a shopping centre (Dunnes Stores), a credit union and a well- established community centre, which also has a bar. Kilnamanagh is close to The Square shopping centre, the third largest shopping centre in Ireland, which expanded with an extra 400 shops in 2010. The Luas red line and M50 are located between Kingswood and Kilnamanagh within walking distance of the entire estate. Kilnamanagh is divided into smaller neighbourhood areas such as Treepark (first built in 1980), Redwood (first built in 1974), Pinetree (first built in 1981 and is the only public housing scheme developed by the County Council), Elmcastle (first built in 1974), Parkhill (built in 1977), Birchview (built in 1972), and Tamarisk (built in 1975). The first houses built which were at Birchview, adjacent to the Greenhills Road, were the only houses in Kilnamanagh that had wooden floorboards on the ground level with under floor heating, and was the only part of the estate to have a street gas supply since its construction in 1972. Most of the other parts of the estate eventually had a street gas supply installed around 1990, with the exception of houses in the Elmcastle neighbourhood which had timber floors and gas ducted heating since their construction in 1974. Clubs, associations and societies There is an active soccer club known as Kilnamanagh AFC.Kilnamanagh AFC The community centre, known as Kilnamanagh Family and Recreation Centre, built two 'astro parks' with floodlights and a grass pitch in August 2009. There is an active GAA clubGAA club in Kilnamanagh. Formerly known as St. Kevin's GAA club, it merged with St. Killian's GAA club from the neighbouring area of Kingswood to become known as St. Kevin's Killians. Kilnamanagh has three GAA pitches in the middle of the estate. Kilnamanagh was well known for its summer projects in the 1980s, involving community members of all ages to participate in activities such as excursions out from the area, arts and crafts, organised children's discos, and cinema. The projects continued for a number of years and were centred mainly at Saint Kevin's Primary School during July every year. Set up by volunteers and parents from the area, it started in 1982 and ran successfully until 1989. Businesses and industries Located between the Mayberry Road and Treepark is the Kilnamanagh Shopping Centre. At its peak during the 1980s, and before the opening of the Square Shopping Centre on the Belgard Road, Kilnamanagh Shopping Centre was an extremely popular shopping destination for people from the surrounding areas. The biggest retailer in the centre is Dunnes Stores, with other units occupied by An Post, Insight Opticions, Boston Barber Bars, 5th Avenue Hair and Beauty, Bookstation and ODC chemist. Kilnamanagh has a fuel filling station located on its primary access route (Mayberry Road). The Cuckoo's Nest Kilnamanagh's local pub, The Cuckoo's Nest, closed in June 2015. It had been in the Lynch family for the last 53 years. In December 2017 work has started demolishing part of the pub to make way for 48 houses and 6 apartments. The new development is to be called TempleWood.

Before the Dutch colonisation in the sixteenth century, indigenous kingdoms ruled the archipelago independently with their own custom laws, known as adat.Pasal 1 Undang-Undang Nomor 19 Tahun 1964 Foreign influences from India, China and Arabia have not only affected the culture, but also weighed in the customary adat laws. Aceh in Sumatra, for instances, observes their own sharia law, while Toraja ethnic group in Sulawesi are still following their animistic customary law. Dutch presence and subsequent occupation of Indonesia for 350 years has left a legacy of Dutch colonial law, largely in the Indonesia civil code. Following the independence in 1945, Indonesia began to form its own modern Indonesian law, not developing it from scratch, but modifying precepts of existing laws. Dutch legal decisions maintain some authority in Indonesia through application of the concordance principle. The three components of adat, or customary law; Dutch- Roman law; and modern Indonesian law co-exist in the current law of Indonesia. Legal system Indonesia legislation comes in different forms. The following official hierarchy of Indonesian legislation (from top to bottom) is enumerated in Article 7 of Act No 12 of 2011, a \\"Law Concerning Making Rules\\": # 1945 Constitution (Undang-Undang Dasar 1945 or UUD'45) # Resolutions of the People's Representative Council (MPR) (Ketetapan Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, Tap MPR). The most famous of the Tap MPRs were formulated by a provisional MPR (MPRS) in April 1966 and were used to ban the PKI, enshrine Supersemar and legitimize the New Order # Acts (Undang-Undang or UU, also translated as Laws) and Government Regulation in Lieu of Acts (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang or Perpu) # Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah or PP) # Presidential Regulation (Peraturan Presiden or Perpres) # Regional Regulation (Peraturan Daerah or Perda) In practice, there are also Presidential Decrees (Keputusan Presiden, Keppres), Presidential Instructions (Instruksi Presiden or Inpres) (most famous to build the Inpres elementary schools), Ministerial Regulations (Peraturan Menteri or Permen/PM), Ministerial Decrees (Keputusan Menteri or Kepmen/KM) and Circulation Letters (Surat Edaran), which sometimes conflict with each other. Once legislative products are promulgated, the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia (Lembaran Negara Republik Indonesia) is issued from the State Secretariat. Sometimes Elucidation (Penjelasan) accompanied some legislations in a Supplement of the State Gazette. The Government of Indonesia also produces State Reports (Berita Negara, lit. \\"State News\\") to publish government and public notices as well as ministerial regulations and decrees. =1945 Constitution= The 1945 Constitution is the highest legal authority in Indonesia, to which the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government must defer. The constitution was written in July and August 1945, when Indonesia was emerging from Japanese control at the end of World War II. It was abrogated by the Federal Constitution of 1949 and the Provisional Constitution of 1950, but restored after the President Sukarno's decree on 5 July 1959. During the 32 years of Suharto's administration, the constitution had never been amended. Suharto refused to countenance any changes to the constitution and the People's Consultative Assembly passed a law in 1985 requiring national referendum for the constitution amendments. After the Suharto's fall in 1998, the People Consultative Assembly amended the constitution four times in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Important amendments include the direct presidential election by the people (third amendment) and the presidential office term from unlimited to only two (first amendment), the regulation of which had made the possibility for Suharto's administration held in office for more than five terms. After the last amendment, the People's Representative Council gained more power to control the executive branch, the Regional Representatives Council was established, regional government was recognised in a section and an expanded section about civil rights among other changes. Currently, the constitution consists of 16 sections and 36 articles. =Undang-Undang= Undang-Undang (English: Acts, usually translated into Laws) can only be established by the People's Representative Council (the DPR).Article 20(1), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. The executive branch (the President) can propose a bill ( or RUU) for consideration by the DPR.Article 5(1), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. During the process of considering a bill, the DPR usually creates a small task group to discuss the proposed legislation with the relevant government ministries.Article 20(2), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. When agreement has been reached and the DPR has approved the bill, the President usually endorses the bill and it is promulgated as Act.Article 20(4), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. However, even if the President refuses to endorse a bill approved by the DPR, the bill is automatically enacted within thirty days and is promulgated.Article 20(5), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. When agreement cannot be reached within the DPR to enact a bill into law, the bill may not be proposed again during the current term of the legislature.Article 20(3), the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia. Problems with the system There are still many problems with the legal system in Indonesia. Many laws and regulations conflict with each other, and because the legal system (including the courts) sometimes does not operate effectively, it can be difficult to resolve these conflicts. Further, the rule of law in Indonesia is often undermined by rife corruption among the nation's judiciary and law enforcers. Josua Gantan, 'Rule of Law Seen as Indonesia's Achilles Heel', The Jakarta Globe, 17 April 2014. =Resources= The overall legal system is badly under resourced, both in the public sector and the private sector which provides many services to clients. For example, in early 2015 it was reported that there was a severe shortage of judges which was particularly affecting the operations of district courts (pengadilan negeri). It was reported that around 250 new judges were needed each year but that no new judges had been appointed for four years. At the time, Indonesia was reported to have a total of around 8,300 judges but that around an additional 1,000 judges were needed to fill the backlog.Fedina S. Sundaryani, 'Judiciary facing 'severe'shortage of judges', The Jakarta Post, 26 February 2015. The Indonesian government and professional lawyers in Indonesia are well-aware of these problems and are working, over time, to improve the system.Tony Budidjaja, 'The future of Indonesia's legal profession: A lawyer's perspective', The Jakarta Post, 11 April 2013.

She is also the frontwoman of Ruby Throat, and formerly of Queenadreena and Daisy Chainsaw. The name \\"Lalleshwari\\" is derived from an ancient Hindu poet. Recording According to Garside's official website, the songs featured on Lullabies in a Glass Wilderness were recorded intermittently over a period of six years in 4-track format. Release and packaging In addition to digital download, Lalleshwari/Lullabies in a Glasswilderness was released in a Digipak CD format, as well as a limited edition CD + DVD set of which only 300 copies were published. This included different artwork and packaging, a bonus DVD disc featuring short films, and an additional track titled \\"Play for Us\\". The first hundred copies featured Garside's handprint in purple paint, as well as her signature and the number out of 100. However, the tracks \\"Marybell (Rides into Town on a Pig)\\" and \\"In the Birdcage, Part 1\\" were only included in the regular edition. The 'Lalleshwari' package offers unique artwork and lyrics presented in the form of a sketchbook. There are also pictures of Garside exclusive to the package and appear nowhere on the regular edition of the album, including an uncensored full frontal nude image. The first 100 limited edition versions of 'Lalleshwari' sold out within 24 hours, costing the buyer £35. =Bonus DVD= There are four films on the DVD itself: 1\\\\. In The Hallway 2\\\\. In The Bedroom 3\\\\. At The Window 4\\\\. In The Kitchen 'In the Hallway' features KatieJane at one end of a hallway as she proceeds to crawl on her hands and knees. The film is played back and forth rhythmically over and over again to give the feeling of perpetual movement without actually getting anywhere. The film is the longest and lasts 17 minutes and 13 seconds. 'In the Bedroom' is played in slow motion and has KatieJane dancing in the darkness of her room while holding a string of fairy lights that illuminate her body. The slow movement and eerie, droning background music make her seem very ethereal. KatieJane is almost naked in this video also, except for her knickers and shoes - but there is no provocative body language and the soft movement of the lights along with her body make her seem like a goddess. KatieJane has commented before that she hates clothes because they are constricting. The length of this film is 8 minutes and 33 seconds. 'At the Window' is simply white noise while Katiejane's voice sings softly over it. As within all the films so far, KatieJane is at the centre of the screen and little else around her is seen. There is only a single window surrounded by darkness in the video that gradually gets bigger. This episode is played in fast motion and KatieJane appears to be putting on a private show. This film again has a shorter length than the previous one, ending at 5 minutes and 18 seconds. KatieJane is filmed through a window for 'In the Kitchen'. She does not face the camera and appears to be at a sink that we never see. Following the pattern, this last film is the shortest - lasting only 1 minute, 16 seconds. There is no music on this film, just a monologue from KatieJane echoing sentences such as \\"I thought maybe I should have done it/ I could have gone anywhere/ I could step sideways right now/ Shall I do that right now?/ What do you think?/ God will show me a sign/ I'll wait 'til I see a sign\\". Here KatieJane questions herself elaborately, and it seems as though she is talking about herself in that very moment because she almost has her back fully to the camera. KatieJane doesn't move from her position throughout the video which is a clear contrast between the previous three episodes where she moves and dances, exposed to the camera. Each video is filmed in black & white and offers no interaction with other people, so the feeling of isolation (whether intentional or not) is quite potent. The regular edition of the 'Lullabies in a Glass Wilderness' album is only available online, through KatieJane's website and MySpace.

He was noted for his works in the Manueline style at the Monastery of Batalha, Portugal. Portal of the Unfinished Chapels in the Monastery of Batalha (close up) He became master of works at the monastery of Batalha in 1490 or slightly earlier, during the reign of king John II of Portugal. Before this date, nothing is known of his private life, as he has left no records to consult other than his architectural marvels. He succeeded the architect Fernão de Évora as architect of the monastery. Mateus Fernandes later became the primary architect of the next king, Manuel I of Portugal, who made him the supervisor of other architectural works in the rest of the country. However, Mateus Fernandes is best known for his work in \\"Manueline style\\" at the entrance portal of the roofless, Unfinished Chapels (Capelas Imperfeitas) of the Monastery of Batalha. The exceptionally large portal rises to a monumental fifteen m by 7½ m wide (50 x 25 ft), overshadowing the rest of the chapels at the monastery. It was originally built in Late Gothic style, but was transformed beyond recognition by Fernandes into one of the first masterpieces of Manueline style (completed in 1509). The Manueline style would then spread from Batalha throughout all Portugal. Tomb of Mateus Fernandes The portal is completely decorated into a lacework of sumptuous Manueline motifs, with flamboyant iconography including the armillary symbol of the cosmos, the cross of the Order of Christ (that decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships of the discoverers), spheres, winged angels, ropes, circles, tree stumps, trefoil arches and florid projections. Fernandes was again original by making the sculptural aspect dominate over the architectural aspect, united in an asymmetrical composition. Mateus Fernandes has tried to represent in stone, the exuberant and expansive spirit in the reign of king Manuel. In the homage of King Manuel I to his predecessor, king D. Duarte mentions his motto Leauté faray tam yaserei (I will always be loyal). This motto was then repeated more than two hundred times, carved into the stone arches, vaults and pillars of the chapels. The original plans for an octagonal dome, supported by buttresses, to crown this pantheon to the House of Aviz was never to be finished since funds ran out, and the construction of the Jerónimos Monastery at Belém would gain absolute priority. Together with the architect Diogo Boitac, he rendered the Manueline style in the tracery of the arcade screens in the ambulatory of the Royal Cloister (Claustro Real) in the Jerónimos Monastery. Fernandes also worked with Boitac to build the abattoirs of Coimbra in 1511. Boitac was another important Manueline architect and sculptor, who even became the son-in-law of Fernandes by marrying his daughter Isabel Henriques in 1512. He (or his son, since they carried the same name) is reported to have directed the construction of the church and the hospital of Misericórdia at Óbidos, while they were engaged at the same time in Caldas da Rainha Teresa Bettencourt da Câmara - Obidos : arquitectura e urbanismo : séculos XVI e XVII, Lisboa : Imprensa Nacional Casa da Moeda, 1990, p. 103 Mateus Fernandes died in Batalha on 10 April 1515 and was buried, with his wife, under a marble tomb-slab close to the portal of the monastery. Diogo Boitac was buried in a tomb close by in 1528. Fernandes was succeeded as master of works at the monastery in 1516 by his son Mateus Fernandes the Younger (died 1528), who had already been deputized to supervise construction at the monastery in his father’s absence. Because of East Indian influences in his work and a vague similarity to the design of the Indian Jain temple of Ahmedabad,Albrecht Haupt (1890) Die Baukunst der Renaissance in Portugal; Frankfurt am Main scholars have often tried to link Mateus Fernandes to Tomás Fernandes, a military architect in India, or to Diogo Fernandes of Beja, who was a member of the embassy in Gujarat in 1513. But all this has remained conjecture. The north porch of St Mary Redcliffe at Bristol has a resemblance to his style, which is a possibility because of the frequent contacts between Portugal and England.Donald Frederick Lach (1977) Asia in the making of Europe; University of Chicago Press; Notes References * *Turner, J.

Scott, also formerly known as Fireboat #2, is a fireboat that was attached to the Los Angeles Fire Department serving the Port of Los Angeles. She was retired in 2003 after 78 years and replaced by Warner L. Lawrence. Ralph J. Scott is on display near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro. On 30 June 1989, she was listed as a National Historic Landmark. She is currently located at the Los Angeles Fire Department, Fire Station 112, at 444 South Harbor Blvd, Berth 86, San Pedro, California, 90731 Description She is long and can pump . Her namesake is a former Chief Engineer of the LAFD. On 6 May 1924 voters approved a $400,000 bond issue for construction of a fireboat, a station to house it and auxiliary apparatus. Following completion of L.E. Caverly's designs, dated 31 January 1925, a $214,000 contract was awarded to the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp. (Todd Shipyard) in San Pedro. The contract called for a 1 October 1925 delivery date. On 25 October 1925, Mrs. Ralph J. Scott christened Los Angeles City No. 2. Commissioned 2 December 1925, Los Angeles City No. 2 went into service with a crew of 14, including a captain, a pilot, a mate, two engineers and nine firemen. The triple screw, white-painted fireboat was riveted steel construction. Her length is 99.3 feet, beam 19 feet, depth of hold 9 feet, 152 gross tons and fuel capacity 2,156 gallons. Originally Los Angeles City No. 2 was powered by seven 350-horsepower, 6-cylinder in-line Winton gasoline engines. Three of these Wintons drove the center, port and starboard propellers for a top rated speed of (the fastest fireboat afloat). The four other Wintons operated the forward-mounted pumps. Increased pumping capacity resulted from the dual capability of the two wing propulsion engines when they were switched from propulsion to pumping mode. There are six Byron Jackson four-stage centrifugal pumps mounted in pairs forward of the propulsion system. Each is rated at at , for a total output of . In 1945 the seven Winton propulsion engines were replaced by Hall Scott engines. Two V-12 Hall Scott Defenders drive the outboard screws. A 6-cylinder in-line Hall Scott Invader drives the center screw. The six Byron Jackson four-stage centrifugal pumps, mounted in pairs forward of the propulsion system are driven as follows: *Pumps numbers 1 through 4 are driven by one of the 275 hp 6-cylinder in-line Hall Scott Invaders. *Pumps numbers 5 and 6 are driven by one of the 625 hp V-12 Hall Scott Defenders. Mounting 5 monitor guns, including a tower gun which could be extended above water level, Los Angeles City No. 2 was one of the first large fireboats powered by gasoline. Carrying of fuel, the fireboat featured a safety system that completely changed the air in the engine room every five minutes as a precaution against leaking gasoline vapors. A further safeguard against below-deck fires was a bank of 18 carbon dioxide extinguishing agent cylinders forward of the water tower. Beginning in 1975 the gasoline engines were replaced with diesels and by 1978 two V-12 Cummins, three 6-cylinder in-line Cummins and two V-12 2-cycle Detroits power the fireboat. Ralph J. Scott carried breathing apparatus, forcible entry tools, heavy stream appliances, a bank of eighteen CO2 cylinders (now removed), flood light, smoke ejector equipment, syphon ejectors, drag and grappling hooks, two Mystery nozzles, and tips up to 6 inches for the largest deck turret. Four reels carry of various sized hose. She was equipped with 24 hose outlets (12 port and 12 starboard) and 5 large deck guns. Big Bertha, mounted on the wheelhouse could deliver via a nozzle. The tower turret, believed to be the first, or at least one of the first, fireboat towers in the nation, rises to a height of above the water. Notable fires 3 March 1926 Los Angeles City No. 2 battled her first major fire when the fully loaded lumber schooner Sierra burned at the E. K. Wood Lumber Company wharf, San Pedro. It took 26 Los Angeles city fire companies and 5 fireboats over two hours to extinguish this difficult fire in the San Pedro area. First arriving fire units reported of Berth 77 on fire and spreading to adjacent boats. Loss estimated to be over $1,500,000 to the wharf and six boats. No injuries were reported and the fire was under investigation. July 1947 Los Angeles City No. 2 maneuvered alongside of Berth 154, the American President Lines pier and warehouse, where she succeeded in stopping the fire at this point. A secondary fire was the burning tanker, SS Markay. Los Angeles City No. 2 used her forward turret, Big Bertha and Rail Standees. 29 June 1954 Los Angeles City No. 2 was put in action during the fire at the San Pedro Marine Terminal of the Tidewater Associated Oil Co., cooling endangered tanks during a three-alarm fire. Starting at 6:25 p.m., explosions and fires quickly engulfed 11 of the 17 storage tanks in the facility. Moored beside the boat was Fireboat No. 3. 24 February 1967 Ralph J. Scott attacked simulated dock fires, berth 128. This was part of \\"Operation West Basin\\" training program. 20 June 1970 SS Pontos cargo ship fire, which occurred at Berth 49 at the harbor. December 1976 The 60,000 ton oil tanker explosion. Station One of the few covered boathouses built for American fireboats, Ralph J. Scotts original housing (later known as Fire Station 112) became a waterfront landmark until its demolition in 1986, to make way for a new cargo container complex. The new, dramatic, award-winning building of Fire Station #112 was designed to shelter Ralph J Scott, while allowing for viewing by visitors. As of 2012, the weathered boat sits up in a cradle behind the station, awaiting funding and man-power necessary to complete the restoration process. The Port of Los Angeles is planning to develop a new facility to house the restored vessel. Fire Station 112 has exhibits on the history of L.A. fireboats, and Ralph J. Scott in particular, explaining the construction and varied uses of this most unusual vessel.

Today the church stands both as a monument to the millions who died or suffered in the camps and as a source of inspiration for the local population. The church was built largely through the efforts of Father Michael Shields of Anchorage who went to Magadan in 1994 specifically to care for those who had suffered in the camps. There are close contacts between Magadan and Anchorage, its twin city. The church also serves the local Polish community. The parish has about 250 registered parishioners, with 50-80 attending sunday masses regularly.  History  In January 1991, Anchorage Archbishop Francis Hurley helped a small group of Russians establish the first Roman Catholic parish in the city of Magadan. For many years parishioners worshiped in a renovated apartment room. In 1994, Father Shields became pastor of the Parish of the Nativity but was seriously threatened in 1997 when the local authorities tried to prevent his work on the grounds that he was not Russian. Shields took the matter to court and, perhaps rather surprisingly, won the case.Judge upholds ruling supporting Fr. Shields’ Magadan ministry , Catholic Anchor, July 19, 2002. In early 2001, Father Shields and his assistant Father David Means of St Louis found a piece of land suitable for the construction of a church. As a result of donations received after Fr Shields appeared on EWTN, the Catholic television network, the new building, which cost some $750,000, started to take shape. There were serious difficulties with some of the building contractors who had to be replaced before work could continue. The central part of the structure was completed in 2002, just in time for Christmas mass to be celebrated there. Work on the interior continued in 2003 leading to the church's consecration by Bishop Kirill Klimovich of Irkutsk in 2004. At January 2019, Father Shields was disallowed to enter Russia because of visa status complications. Martyrs of Kolyma, Magadan  Remembering the Martyrs  The church is closely linked to the Kolyma labor camps and those who died there. This is apparent in the icons created by Russian artist Svetlana Ryanitsyna (Светлана Ряницына, Moscow)Icons by Svetlana Ryanitsyna. Retrieved 27 February 2007 especially those in the Martyrs' chapel entitled New Martyrs of Russia and Martyrs of Kolyma. The latter contains all the elements of the traditional Orthodox icon but the figures depict the new martyrs of the twentieth century. Further examples of the icons and artwork can be seen at the church's own website.  Other missions  The Church of the Nativity contributes much to the Magadan community where it continues to serve former prisoners and other less fortunate residents, particularly alcoholics through its own Alcoholics Anonymous sessions. In addition, it has a mission in the coastal village of Ola, Russia, 35 km to the east, where it offers support to the indigenous people who are largely unemployed. There is also a mission in Sokol, near the local airport, offering help to those without employment, including ex- employees of bankrupt Magadan airways.

It was created in the early 1990s initially to promote the rights of ethnic Russians living in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union. The group contested a number of elections to the Duma in the 1990s. In the 1995 Duma election, the group took 4.3% of the vote, just missing the 5% threshold to gain seats. In 1999 it again failed to pass the 5% threshold, although KRO candidates did win a small number of single-mandate district seats. In 1996 Alexander Lebed used the KRO as the organisational vehicle for his campaign for the presidency. Lebed was surprisingly successful, taking 15% of the popular vote and later going on to become governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In 2006 the KRO was revived by Russian nationalist politician Dmitry Rogozin following the merger of his Rodina party into a new Fair Russia coalition. Rogozin initially stated that he would turn the KRO into a political party to contest the Duma elections in December 2007. In April 2007 Rogozin announced that he had formed a new party, the Great Russia Party, in conjunction with the nationalist Movement Against Illegal Immigration. The party would campaign for seats in the Duma and initially stated its support for Alexander Lukashenko's candidacy for the Russian Presidency, a campaign which is impossible as Lukashenko is not a Russian citizen.

It is owned by Cumulus Broadcasting and airs a talk radio format. WJCW's transmitter, offices and studios are on Free Hill Road in Gray, Tennessee.Radio-Locator.com/WJCW The complex also houses the studios for Cumulus' other Tri-Cities radio stations. WJCW broadcasts with a 5,000 watt non-directional signal in the daytime. But at night, to protect other stations on AM 910, the station reduces power to 1,000 watts and uses a directional antenna. The station is East Tennessee's AM primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System, with WJXB-FM in Knoxville performing the PEP function on FM in east Tennessee. History On December 13, 1938, the station first signed on as WJHL, owned by John H. Lancaster, Sr.Broadcasting Yearbook 1940 page 154 It was the second radio station in the Tri-Cities and the first in Johnson City. It began broadcasting at only 250 watts. By the 1940s, it got a power boost to its current 5,000 watts by day, 1,000 watts at night, and became an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network, later ABC. By 1950, WJHL joined CBS, an affiliation that lasted five decades. Under Lancaster's son Hanes and grandson Hanes Jr., WJHL added 100.7 WJHL-FM in 1948 (now 101.5 WQUT) and in 1953 added WJHL-TV Channel 11. Because the AM station carried CBS programming, WJHL-TV became a CBS-TV affiliate.

Wilson (son of the founder of the area's first radio station, WOPI)WOPI History Channel 11 kept the WJHL-TV call letters, while AM 910 was renamed WJCW after Wilson's initials and carried a country music format. In the 1980s, listeners began shifting to FM radio for music, so in 1990, WJCW became the Tri-Cities' first news/talk station. In 2000, the station was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, a forerunner of Cumulus.Broadcasting Yearbook 2010 page D-502 Programming On weekdays, WJCW airs a local morning show called Thinking Out Loud with hosts Tim Cable and Carl Swann.

These experiments may have extraordinary effects such as softening metal, allowing the body to resist water pressure, speeding or reversing the body's ageing, giving people super-strength, or even turning people black. Also a skilled engineer, he has constructed numerous incredible machines such as individual dolphin-like submarines, and other handy gadgets. He is also proven to be a paleontologist, an astronomer and an astrophysician. Champignac is connected to several almost as eccentric scientists who frequently visit him at the castle, bringing new inventions and experiments that often bring about troublesome consequences. Due to his overall brilliance, he has several times been the victim of industrial espionage. A wife of some time in his past has been mentioned, but no explanation of her absence was ever given.

Le réveil du Z (Tome & Janry) =Spip= Spip is one of the central characters of the series, Spirou's domesticated, courageous and sharp, grouchy pet squirrel. As his companion in all his adventures. Spip cannot talk, but his thoughts, often witty or sarcastic, are displayed to the reader, reflecting his usually grouchy mood. He's not pleased to frequently find himself in danger, but will be helpful in any situation as much as he can. Over the several authorship periods the character has evolved: Rob-Vel and Jijé periods Spip is saved by Spirou in Rob-Vel's and Jijé's first joint adventure L'Héritage de Bill Money (The Inheritance of Bill Money, 1938), and from then on he stands by his master's side. Under Rob-vel his presence is just visual, occasionally serving to gnaw ropes that bind his master, or adding to a comical detail. It is under Jijé's authorship he gains the capacity to speak through \\"thought balloons\\" (similar to Snoopy and Garfield). From this point he is given to state his opinion on any situation, often in a comical manner, and his communications appear to be understood. Franquin period Under Franquin's authorship, Spirou and Fantasio lose the ability to understand Spip, and when the Marsupilami joins the family, he also loses a great deal of attention but gains the perspective to feel ignored and underappreciated. In the shadow of his extraordinary fellow pet, he is less influential, although there are exceptions. In La corne de rhinoceros, he saves his friends from an angry elephant, earning him the title \\"king of creation\\". Near the end of this era, in QRN sur Bretzelburg, he is allowed to shine. Fournier period Fournier's Spip continues where Franquin's left off, his sarcasms becoming more frequent and self-pitying. He occasionally breaks the fourth wall, acknowledging that he is in a comic book and sometimes even complaining that Spirou and Fantasio are not exactly his idea of comic book heroes. Complaints aside, he was still an active (if often unwilling) participant in the stories, even saving the day on a few occasions, such as in L'abbaye truquée. Tome & Janry period In the beginning, Tome and Janry continued Spip much as Fournier had, letting him make biting remarks about whatever situation he was in, providing comedy relief and occasionally contributing to the plots. However, as the series evolved and grew more dramatic and mature, Spip's role was greatly reduced, his comments becoming less frequent until he stopped talking entirely. In later albums he's more or less a background character, still always by Spirou's side but seldom noticed by anyone. This was even parodied in Spirou à Moscou, where he after a kidnapping spends much of the story with a Band-Aid covering his mouth, and Spirou and Fantasio don't notice it. =Sprtschk= Sprtschk is an atomic scientist genius, whose mind is constantly fixed on physics formulas in pursuit of discovering the solution to create the ultimate bomb. Invited to The Count's castle for reason's unknown during the hatching of the Mesozoic egg, the Count appears to quite dislike this scientist, and he spends most of the time by himself to ponder his scientific riddle. Sprtschk's appearance in the Spirou adventures is very brief, though memorable and ironic. Having presumably just discovered the great goal of his career with sinister satisfaction, he is suddenly eaten, accidentally, by a vegetarian dinosaur. The Count feigns some guilt about his part in Sprtschk's death, but is more distraught when his trees are destroyed. Appearances *13. Le voyageur du Mésozoïque (Franquin) =Marcelin Switch= Marcelin Switch appeared in QRN sur Bretzelburg. Switch was a ham radio operator who got in touch with King Ladislas of Bretzelburg who was being kept a virtual prisoner in his palace by General Schmetterling. Ladislas wanted Switch to inform world opinion of his plight but the Bretzelburg secret police intercepted their communications and set out to kidnap Switch. By mistake however they captured Fantasio instead. Spirou resolved to go to Bretzelburg in order to rescue Fantasio and dragged the reluctant Switch along with him. Switch was terrified from the start, and became even more so as they progressed through Bretzelburg, being convinced that they last hour had come at every minute. Disguised as window cleaners he and Spirou managed to sneak into the Royal palace during which a nervous Switch wrote out his will. He even fainted when he overheard an outburst by the intimidating General Schmetterling. Switch, Spirou, Fantasio and the local rebel movement opposed to Schmetterling eventually succeeded in overthrowing him and restoring the King to his authority. Ladislas subsequently introduced reforms to overcome the economic plight caused by the General who had been fraudulently embezzling the state's coffers. The King even awarded Switch the Bretzelburg Medal of Courage! Switch had a sister whose children enjoyed comics. In a breach of the fourth wall Switch got the characters of Spirou magazine mixed up with those of rival publication Tintin magazine. Appearances *18. QRN sur Bretzelburg (Franquin) =Zantafio= Zantafio is a recurring antagonist in the series. He was created by Franquin and first appeared in Spirou et les héritiers (1952). Zantafio bears a strong resemblance to Fantasio, because they are cousins. Appearances *4. Spirou et les héritiers (Franquin) *7. Le dictateur et le champignon (Franquin) *8.

Initially Zorglub's character was that of a sinister megalomaniac, mad scientist, but later becomes a reformed villain. Appearances *15. Z comme Zorglub (Franquin) *16. L'ombre du Z (Franquin) *19.

Track listing  # The Quiet Club - 44:50 Overview An Opal release, with no catalogue number, this title is only available from EnoShop. The music on the album is taken from an Installation—a show featuring music and visuals—that took place at the Sonic Boom exhibition of the Hayward Gallery, London, in April–June 2000. The event, featuring over 30 other artists, was curated by David Toop. Part of Eno's Quiet Club series of Installations, it combined 12 audio elements with 10 visual light-sculpture generative elements, which was, itself, part of a series of multi-dimensional generative music pieces using asynchronous CD players, carousel projectors and video monitors used in other Installation pieces. In a conversation with Toop, Eno's view is of a quiet \\"recovery area\\" situated within a city area, a theory which he has spoken of since the mid- eighties; a \\"critically functioning public space\\", a (preferably) darkened room containing large-format screens, and many CD players and sculptures. Eno has said of his Installations \\"I want to make places that feel like music. I want to make things which are like music for the eyes. I want to extend music out into space, into the three dimensions of space, and into colour\\". The album contains only one track, which is based upon, and essentially an extended remix / melding of the tracks Ikebukuro, from his 1992 album The Shutov Assembly and Kites II & Kites III from his 1999 album Kite Stories. The heavily treated, slowed-down vocals of the Kite Stories part are based on a Japanese ghost-story, Onmyo-Ji, by Reiko Otano and was read by Kyoko Inatome, a waitress from his favorite sushi restaurant. Eno calls this process \\"composting\\" .... \\"...so many processings and reprocessings - it's a bit like making soup from the leftovers of the day before, which in turn was made from leftovers...\\", \\"some earlier pieces I worked on became digested by later ones, which in turn became digested again. The technique is like composting: converting what would otherwise have been waste into nourishment\\". In that same year, 2000, Eno issued a limited-edition 2-CD album with Reiko Okano, Baku Yumemakura & Peter Schwalm called Music for Onmyo-Ji, the first CD of which consists of Japanese music played on traditional instruments.

Moore (November 3, 1845 – March 23, 1930) was a lawyer, politician, and jurist from the U.S. state of Michigan. Moore was born in Commerce, Michigan the fifth child of eight to Jacob J. and Hebsibeth (Gillett) Moore. His father was a native of Warren County, New Jersey and his mother was born in Monroe County, New York. The Moore family came to Michigan in 1833 and the Gillett family in 1834. Both families settled in Macomb County and Jacob and Hebsibeth were married on January 1. 1837. In 1838, Jacob moved to Dryden in Lapeer County for six years before moving to Commerce, where he established himself a furniture manufacturer. In 1858, he moved to the village of Walled Lake in Oakland County, where he operated a sawmill. In 1860, he purchased a farm and moved there while continuing to run the sawmill. While Joseph was working at the sawmill, he read a copy of Blackstone's Commentaries lent to him by James D. Bateman, a local harnessmaker who had taught himself the law and made a second career for himself. Moore attributed his own interest in the legal profession to this influence. In 1864, at the age of 19, he and a brother drew lots for the opportunity to enlist in the 30th Michigan Infantry to fight in the Civil War alongside an older brother. The lot fell to Joseph, but he was rejected by the examining surgeon in Detroit. The next day, the other brother enlisted in the 22nd Regiment, Michigan Volunteer Infantry, was accepted and served until the end of the war. In 1865, Moore entered Hillsdale College and alternately attended fall and spring terms while also teaching at local schools during the winter term and working at his father's businesses during the summers. While he did not complete his course of study, the college conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts in 1879. In 1868, he entered the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor for one year. After which, he went to Lapeer and applied to practice law in the court of Judge Josiah Turner. He was admitted to the bar in October 1869 and quickly developed great skill as a trial lawyer. Moore was elected Circuit Court Commissioner for Lapeer County for two years, and was then elected Prosecuting Attorney of the county. In the spring of 1874, he became Mayor of Lapeer, while continuing to execute his office as Prosecuting Attorney. In 1876, he was unanimously selected by the Republican Party to be the candidate for State Senator, but he declined. He agreed to run in 1878, and was elected to represent the 20th District in the Michigan State Senate. He declined renomination in 1880, and returned to the practice of law. In 1887, he became president of the Board of Water Commissioners in Lapeer. In the spring of 1888, Moore was elected Circuit Court Judge of the Sixth Circuit, where he served for the next eight years. In 1891, he was appointed by U.S. President Benjamin Harrison as part of a commission to select lands for permanent reservations for the Mission Indians in Southern California. In 1895, he was elected to the Michigan Supreme Court, commencing his office on January 1, 1896. He served on the court for the next 30 years, and was Chief Justice in 1904-1905, 1912, and 1920. He resigned in December 1925 at the age of 80. Moore married Ella L. Bentley on December 3, 1872, but the couple had no children.

It uses the assumption that good game-specific move ordering causes a program to search the most likely moves early. If a cut-off is going to happen in a search, the first few moves are the ones most likely to cause them. In games like chess, most programs search winning captures and \\"killers\\" first. Late move reductions will reduce the search depth for moves searched later at a given node. This allows the program to search deeper along the critical lines, and play better. Most chess programs will search the first several moves at a node to full depth. Often, they do not reduce moves considered to be very tactical, such as captures or promotions. If the score of the move at a reduced depth is smaller than the alpha, the move is assumed to be bad. However, if the score is larger than alpha, the reduced tells us nothing so we will have to do a full search (fail-low). This search reduction can lead to a different search space than the pure alpha-beta method which can give different results. Care must be taken to select the reduction criteria or the search will miss some deep threats.

Below is a list of unmade serials which were submitted by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, but for one reason or another were not made. Many have since been the subject of a feature in Doctor Who Magazine, or other professional periodicals or books devoted to the television show. Such serials exist during the tenure of each of the previous twelve incarnations of the Doctor. The reasons for the serials being incomplete include strike action (which caused the partially filmed Shada to be abandoned), actors leaving roles (The Final Game, which was cancelled after Roger Delgado's death), and the series being put on hiatus twice—once in 1985, and again in 1989—causing the serials planned for the following series to be shelved. The plots of the unmade serials also vary. A theme of a civilisation where women are dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale was intended to be the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance. Some unused stories have since been adapted for other media. Shada was made into an audio play of the same name, while several unmade serials have been compiled into an audio series released by Big Finish called The Lost Stories. First Doctor =Submitted for season 1= The Giants/Nothing At The End of The Lane The first serial of the series, The Giants, was originally to be written by C. E. Webber, the first episode being titled \\"Nothing at the End of the Lane\\", and would concern the four main characters (at that point named as the Doctor, Cliff, Lola, and Biddy) being shrunk to a \\"miniature size\\" and attacked by giant animals. The episode would have revealed that the Doctor had escaped from \\"his own galaxy\\" in the year 5733, seeking a perfect society in the past, and that he was pursued by agents from his own time who sought to prevent him from stopping their society from coming into being. By May 1963 a storyline for all four parts had been established and the first two episodes scripted. However, the story was rejected on 10 June 1963 on the grounds that the story was too thin on characterisation and that the giant monsters would be clichéd and too expensive to produce. Some of the initial opening script was retained for An Unearthly Child when Anthony Coburn was commissioned to write a replacement on 14 June 1963, though details like those about the Doctor's home were removed. Around early September 1963 the idea was given to Robert Gould to develop, referred to as the \\"miniscule\\" storyline, which was anticipated to be the fourth serial of the season, but this story was later dropped from this slot in January 1964 and Gould abandoned work on the story altogether a month later. In March 1964 the story idea was offered to writer Louis Marks and eventually became Planet of Giants. On March 6, 2000, author Daniel O’ Mahony published Nothing At The End of The Lane as a Short Trips and Side Steps adventure book by BBC Books. The Masters of Luxor The Masters of Luxor, originally titled The Robots, was a six-part story submitted by Anthony Coburn while he was part of the BBC Script Department and considered for the second serial of Season 1, in which the Doctor faces a self-aware robot which is trying to gain a soul. It was rejected by the production team in mid- September 1963 in favour of Terry Nation's first Dalek serial. Titan Books published the unused scripts in August 1992. Edited by John McElroy, the text of Coburn's script was amended to fit in with accepted conventions – for example, consistent use of the name \\"Susan\\", rather than the \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"Sue\\" used by Coburn. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in August 2012. The Hidden Planet The Hidden Planet by Malcolm Hulke was commissioned in December 1963 and at one point was to be the fourth serial and then later the fifth serial of Series 1 after the insertion of The Edge of Destruction into the production block. It would further be deferred in January 1964 when it was realised that substantial rewrites would need to be undertaken. The story would have concerned a planet in an orbit opposite Earth's, with a parallel but in some ways opposite society to ours; for example, women were to be the dominant sex and all clovers would have four leaves. The original script was sent back for rewrites, and due to a pay dispute the rewrites were not made until after Susan had left the series; this necessitated further rewriting. A third submission was similarly rejected as Ian and Barbara were due to leave, and the script was dropped. The story was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank in 1983, when Doctor Who Magazine issue 76 claimed that one episode had in fact been filmed and rediscovered, and would be integrated into a twentieth anniversary special co-starring the Fifth Doctor entitled The Phoenix Rises. Britain 408 AD Written by Malcolm Hulke.. The story involved the departure of the Romans from Britain around the start of the fifth century in the midst of clashes against the Celts and the Saxons, culminating with the time travellers fleeing the indigenous savages back to the safety of the TARDIS. Britain 408 AD was first submitted on September 2, 1963. Story editor David Whitaker asked Hulke to revise his original storyline as he felt that the plot—with its many opposing factions—was too complicated, and that the serial's conclusion echoed that of An Unearthly Child too closely. It was hoped that an amended version of Britain 408 AD might occupy the sixth slot of Season One (Serial F), to be directed by Christopher Barry, but on September 23 it was decided that the production block did not need another historical story and Hulke's serial was abandoned. The spot in the schedule was ultimately occupied by The Aztecs, while Hulke began work on The Hidden Planet instead (see above). Following Whitaker's departure, Hulke resubmitted Britain 408 AD. It was rejected on April 2, 1965, by Whitaker's successor, Dennis Spooner, because the Romans had already featured in his own story The Romans.Doctor Who – The Handbook: The First Doctor; Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition #7 The Red Fort Commissioned 24 September 1963, Terry Nation had intended for his second seven-part serial to be set during the British Raj in India (probably to have been the eighth serial), but the story was ultimately abandoned as the Daleks became a success, and demand for further science fiction adventures grew.. Farewell Great Macedon Farewell Great Macedon (also known as Alexander the Great in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and was written by Moris Farhi. In the story, the Doctor and his companions are framed for murder as part of a conspiracy to kill Alexander the Great and must pass a number of trials, including walking on hot coals, to gain the trust of his bodyguard Ptolemy.. The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010. The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance was the first script sent by Moris Farhi. It was one episode long and was a calling card piece never seriously pitched for production. This story never made it to the production stage, and was included in the 2009 publication of Farhi's script for Farewell Great Macedon. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010. The Living World Written by Alan Wakeman. Wakeman was one of several writers contacted by David Whitaker in mid-1963. The story was commissioned on 31 July 1963. It involved a planet ruled by sentient rocks and trees, with the ability to control humans with an inaudible sound.

A second attempt at the storyline, written by Louis Marks would become Planet of Giants. \\"Untitled storyline (Gould 2)\\" An idea suggested by Robert Gould when he abandoned work on the \\"miniscule\\" storyline in February 1964 that involved a planet where plants treated people the way people treat plants.

The story focused the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, Vicki landing the TARDIS on the planet Numir, which its sun was extinguished, and encounter the surface dwelling ‘light people’ and the subterranean ‘shadow people’.

It was also rejected in favour of Bill Strutton's The Web Planet. It was later adapted by Matt Fitton for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2013. The Slide Written by Victor Pemberton. This story focused on a sentient form of mud that tries to take over the minds of British townfolk. Script editor for Doctor Who David Whittaker rejected it on the grounds that it was derivative of the Quatermass serials of the 1950s. Pemberton later submitted it to BBC Radio after he removed the Doctor Who elements from it. The Slide was commissioned as a seven-part serial which aired on the BBC Light Programme, beginning on February 13, 1966.

The Doctor and his companions are taken captive and trained up by the robots as the replacement crew members, however only three additional crew members are required, so the member of the Doctor's party that proves least useful is to be callously killed off by the human crew. This was Holmes first story submission for the series, and was primarily rejected due to the robots role being similar to that of the Mechanoids in The Chase from the previous season.\\"Robert Holmes: A Life in Words\\", page 55-57, Richard Molesworth, Telos, 2013.

Planned as the fourth serial of Series 4, The Imps was a four-part story concerned about a spaceship overrun by Imp-like aliens and aggressive alien vegetation. The script was commissioned on 17 October 1966, and soon had to be rewritten to accommodate new companion Jamie. However, due to sickness on the part of Emms, this took so long that further rewrites were needed to explain the loss of Ben and Polly, its place in the schedule was taken by The Underwater Menace and on 4 January 1967 the story was dropped. Emms reused elements of the story in Mission to Venus, a Choose Your Own Adventure-style story featuring the Sixth Doctor. The Mutant Written by Barry Letts, this story outline, submitted around November 1966 to story editor Gerry Davis,DWM 230 page 26 would involve a race of beings undergoing a cycle of mutations, akin to that of a butterfly, moving from one form to another via a chrysalis stage.

The Return of the Neanderthal Written by Roger Dixon, this storyline was about the TARDIS being dragged beneath the sands of Terunda to encounter people descended from Earth's Neanderthal Man who wish to return to the Earth of 2016.

The Doctor and his companions are forced to perpetually enact the King's favourite story without changing any aspect of it. Operation Werewolf Written by Douglas Camfield & Robert Kitts, the storyline for this six-part story was submitted to the production office on 18 September 1967, although Camfield & fellow BBC worker Kitts had developed the outline in 1965 due to Camfield's dismay at another sub- standard script, and would probably have been directed by Camfield himself. The story saw the Doctor arrive in Normandy just prior to the D-Day landings. It would feature a plan to stop the Nazis from using a form of matter teleportation. Only a draft script for episode 1 would be written. It went through several rewrites until 1967 when it was finally abandoned due to producer Innes Lloyd moving on and the writers both having other commitments. This story was given individual episode titles even though this practice had stopped with The Savages in 1966. Episode titles were listed as: \\"The Secret Army\\", \\"Chateau Of Death\\", \\"Lair Of The Werewolf\\", \\"Friend Or Foe\\", \\"Village Of The Swastika\\", and \\"Crossfire\\".

At the end of the story Jamie would remain behind as the new laird, ending his travels with the Doctor. By late April 1968, it was clear that Frazer Hines would be leaving the series sometime during Season Six. One candidate for his departure story was Haisman and Lincoln's third Yeti serial, which they were working on around the start of June. Over the summer, however, the writers became embroiled in a dispute over copyright with the BBC regarding the Quarks, robot monsters which had appeared in their previous Doctor Who commission, The Dominators. The ensuing acrimony resulted in the abandonment of The Laird of McCrimmon during August 1968. The Lords of the Red Planet Written by Brian Hayles. The story would have been about the origins of the Ice Warriors. The story was initiated after the transmission of their debut story. This storyline was dropped around May 1968.

The idea of the Ice Warriors returning to the series inspired Hayles to begin scripting The Seeds of Death. The Prison in Space The Prison in Space by Dick Sharples, originally titled The Amazons,. The story also had a record of six other working titles during its development. Sharples returned to the idea of a female-dominated planet.. last attempted with The Hidden Planet. The Doctor and Jamie were to be imprisoned, and Zoe was to start a sexual revolution and then be brainwashed. The four- part story was commissioned on 4 June 1968 and was intended to inject humour into the show. It was to feature Jamie in drag and end with Jamie deprogramming Zoe by smacking her bottom. The serial was rewritten to accommodate Frazer Hines' desire to leave by introducing a new companion named Nik, and again when he later decided to stay. Scripts for the first two episodes were delivered on 27 August 1968. The production team became unhappy with the serial, and when Sharples refused to perform further rewrites, the serial was dropped.

Beginning life as The Rosacrutians,. this story came about after Tosh contacted the production staff in early 1968 to see if they would be interested in him pitching a script.. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012. The Stones of Darkness Written by Brian Hayles, not much is known about it. \\"Untitled storyline (Ling)\\" Written by Peter Ling, not much is known about it. This involved a story in which time runs backwards. \\"Untitled storyline (Sherwin)\\" Written by Derrick Sherwin, not much is known about it, apart from two things (according to The War Games' DVD information subtitles): it was going to be a studio-bound adventure and was to have ended with the exiled Doctor and Zoe stranded on Earth. Third Doctor =Submitted for season 7= The Circles of Power Written by Brian Hayles. This story would have focused on a faulty communications satellite which causes the release of robotic \\"sensorspheres\\" which induce amnesia on their victims. The incident would have almost ignited World War III. The Mists of Madness Written by Brian Wright.. This story would have seen the Doctor discovering an community of artificially made humans. The storyline was submitted on 9 May 1969 and was commissioned by script editor Terrance Dicks. The story was scheduled to be the finale to Season 7 but due to Wright taking an academic writing post in Bristol, he was unable to write it so the story was abandoned. The Shadow People Written by Charlotte & Dennis Plimmer, this seven-part story was submitted to the production office 10 November 1969.

The story involved an Ice Warrior plan to invade the Earth using a 'Z' beam which freezes things it strikes to absolute zero. When used on humans, it turns them into zombie-like slaves. Script editor Dicks rejected the storyline, but the inclusion of the Ice Warriors inspired the development of The Curse of Peladon. The Daleks in London The Daleks in London, commissioned on 25 May 1971, was to be the final story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, other than the fact that it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London.. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale. The Mega Written by Bill Strutton, this four-part story was submitted to the production office on 25 September 1970 after Strutton had gained an interest in writing for the series again after scripting The Web Planet five years earlier.

The Shape of Terror Written by Brian Hayles, this story was submitted during the spring of 1971. This story would have seen an alien shape-shifting entity attacking a space station and attempts to merge itself with the Doctor, which unwittingly causes its own destruction. Hayles recycled elements from it, particularly its Agatha Christie mystery style in his script for The Curse of Peladon. =Submitted for season 10= Multiface Written by Godfrey Harrison,. this four-part story was commissioned by Letts on 19 July 1971. Feeling it was more fantastical than appropriate for Doctor Who, Letts dropped the story on 25 February 1972. =Submitted for season 11= The Automata Written by Robert Holmes,. this four-part story was commissioned on 16 January 1973. Letts and Dicks did not like the storyline and it was replaced by The Time Warrior. The Final Game The Third Doctor's final story was to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was commissioned on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were brothers or two different, opposing aspects of the same being (the Ego and the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, was killed in a car accident in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story. The story was immediately replaced by Planet of the Spiders.

It was subsequently commissioned for scripts on 24 January 1974 and planned as the second story of Season 12. It was dropped on 17 June 1974 and replaced by Lucarotti's The Ark in Space. The Ark in Space (Lucarotti) Written by John Lucarotti, this script came about after Space Station was rejected. and Lucarotti was suggested by Terrance Dicks as a replacement writer on the strength of his Moonbase 3 script. The story would use the same space station setting as Space Station,. the setting being dictated by the production office as means of saving money by having it share sets with Revenge of the Cybermen. Commissioned in June 1974, Lucarotti devised the concept of the ark, a space station that housed a huge plot of countryside the size of Kent – a sort of Home Counties in space. His six-part story concerned the invasion of the ark by a species called the Delc, a spore- like fungus with separate heads and bodies. The final episode was to have the Doctor defeating the Delc leader by hitting it out into space with a golf club, and indeed Lucarotti planned to give each episode a frivolous title, citing Puffball as the title of an early episode and Golfball as the title of the final episode. When the draft scripts arrived from his home in Corsica, Holmes and Hinchcliffe felt they were far too ambitious and complicated to realise on the programme's budget and Lucarotti had over-conceptualised the story, which meant that it was inappropriate for the viewers.Archive.org/web/Doctor Who In-Vision 002 The Ark in Space - retrieved June 6th 2014 It was replaced by a different story with the same title by Robert Holmes, which shared only the setting with the previous version.

This storyline was submitted in November 1974. Not much is known about it. \\"Untitled Dalek storyline\\" Written by Terry Nation. It was rejected for being too similar to his previous Dalek stories. It was replaced with Genesis of the Daleks.  Return of the Cybermen  Written by Gerry Davis. This story was submitted to the production office, sometime in 1974 and commissioned soonafter.

Fires of the Starmind Written by Marc Platt, this unsolicited story was submitted to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 and dealt with a sentient star using the Time Lord libraries as a means of invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that Fires of the Starmind had more potential than most of the other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to continue writing. Fires of the Starmind was rejected on 15 December 1975. The Haunting Written by Terrance Dicks,. this six-part story. was submitted at the start of November 1974 and was to have dealt with vampires.

Dicks later reused some of the material for his 1977 script The Vampire Mutation, the story that eventually became State of Decay.

The story revolved around a nuclear submarine diving into the 'Fault of Menday' and discovering a subterranean world..

The Prisoner of Time Written by Barry Letts, the storyline for this four-part story was commissioned on 21 January 1975.

It would turn out that a group was scaring people away in order to gain access to a sarcophagus which would contain wild rice from thousands of years ago..

Return to Sukannan Written by Terry Nation, this story was commissioned for a storyline on 13 February 1975. It was replaced by The Android Invasion. The Silent Scream Written by Chris Boucher, this story was an unsolicited submission sent to the production office in early 1975. Although only fifteen minutes worth of material was considered unsuitable for Doctor Who, script editor Robert Holmes brought in Chris Boucher to discuss ideas with himself and producer Philip Hinchcliffe. This led to unmade scripts for The Dreamers of Phados and The Mentor Conspiracy, before finally being commissioned as The Face of Evil.DWM 229 page 26 The story is completely unrelated to The Fourth Doctor Adventures release of the same name. =Submitted for season 14= The Gaslight Murders Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story involving murders in Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, was approached by script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would introduce a new companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character was to be a Cockney girl whom the Doctor would take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil with the Eliza Doolittle character being replaced with Leela, while Holmes reused the general framework in The Talons of Weng-Chiang. The Foe from the Future Written by Robert Banks Stewart as a six-part story,. the story was commissioned in May 1976. This story was replaced by The Talons of Weng-Chiang,. which used the same basic premise of a villain traveling back in time,. when Stewart took up the post of script editor on the series Armchair Thriller and was unable to deliver the scripts, forcing Robert Holmes to step in to rework the story. It was later adapted by John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in January 2012. The Dreamers of Phados Written by Chris Boucher,. was submitted at some point after The Silent Scream had been rejected in early 1975.

The Lost Legion Written by Douglas Camfield, this four-part story. was commissioned on 22 January 1976. The story would involve the Doctor and Sarah arriving in North Africa at an isolated French Legion outpost. This has become the battleground for a fight between two alien races, the Skarkel and Khoorians. The story was planned to write out the character of Sarah and would see Sarah killed by one of the aliens. The first script was submitted on 9 February 1976 and removed from the series schedule in April 1976. Camfield would continue to work on the scripts, delivering the final part on 24 September 1976, but the production team were no longer interested in pursuing the story. The Mentor Conspiracy Written by Chris Boucher, this story was, like The Dreamer of Phados, written to an idea brief from Holmes and Hinchcliffe. It was to be set on a space ship which has been home to several generations of a civilization. The script was turned down on 30 October 1975.. =Submitted for season 15= Killers of the Dark Following the successful realisation of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey on screen in The Deadly Assassin, producer Graham Williams wanted another Gallifrey story. Script editor Anthony Read approached David Weir with whom he had worked before.. Weir's script, a six-part story, was planned as the final story of Season 15 and was commissioned on 18 July 1977. Weir's script had elements drawn from Asian cultures, and included a race of cat- people with links to Gallifrey. Scenes included a gladiatorial duel in a stadium filled with cat-people. Read and director Gerald Blake, upon reading the finished script, determined that the story would be impossible to shoot on Doctor Who's budget and the story was abandoned mid-August 1977.. With only two weeks to spare before filming, Read and Williams quickly co-wrote a replacement script in the form of The Invasion of Time. When asked about Weir's story at a fan convention years later, Williams could not recall its title and made up the name The Killer Cats of Geng Singh, by which title the story became widely known in fan circles. The Divided Written by Moris Farhi, this four-part story. was officially commissioned by producer Graham Williams on 8 November 1977. The script was not produced and Farhi no longer recalls what it was about; the script itself is lost. It is unclear of whether this was considered for either season 15 or season 16. The Krikkitmen Written by Douglas Adams, this was one of several ideas that Adams proposed to the production office around 1976. It was rejected by script editor Robert Holmes, who nonetheless encouraged Adams to continue submitting material; this ultimately led to his commission for The Pirate Planet. In 1980, Adams revised The Krikkitmen for use by Paramount Pictures as a potential Doctor Who feature film, although nothing came of this project.. Finally, Adams included many of the ideas from The Krikkitmen in his novel Life, the Universe and Everything, the second sequel to his The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. A novel adaptation of the Doctor Who version by James Goss was released by BBC Books in January 2018. \\"Untitled storyline (Holmes)\\" Written by Robert Holmes, this storyline was considered in the autumn of 1976 when it was assumed Hinchcliffe would still be producing Season 15. It was to have been inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. =Submitted for season 16= Shield of Zareg Written by Ted Lewis,. and also known as The Doppelgängers,. The search for the fourth segment of the Key to Time takes the Doctor and Romana to Nottingham where they meet Robin Hood and discover that the alleged hero is actually a blackhearted villain.. The scripts for the first two episodes of the four-part fourth serial of the season were delivered to the production office on 28 April 1978. Although a third script arrived on 12 May 1978, Lewis turning up inebriated to a meeting with Graham Williams and Anthony Read and the unsuitability of the submitted material meant the story was dropped and replaced by David Fisher's The Androids of Tara, which deliberately adopted the same swashbuckling genre as Lewis' storyline.. The Twelfth Doctor would eventually meet Robin Hood in Robot of Sherwood (2014). The 1995 Doctor Who Magazine Summer Special ran a feature on a supposed lost Season 16 story titled The Lords of Misrule that purported to be by Ted Willis. This was a hoax based on a misreport that Willis - the creator of Dixon of Dock Green - had been commissioned to write for Doctor Who in this season, not Lewis. \\"Untitled storyline (Boucher)\\" Written by Chris Boucher, this idea was submitted shortly after Boucher had completed Image of the Fendahl. The story involved a remote Earth outpost under attack. BBC Head of Drama Ronnie Marsh did not want writers working on both Doctor Who and Blake's 7 at the same time, and the story was consequently dropped. \\"Untitled storyline (Adams)\\" Proposed by Douglas Adams. It concerned the time lords mining a planet and using a machine that would sap the aggression out of the natives to make them peaceful. One time lord would become trapped in the statue and absorb all the aggression driving him insane. He planned to make the machine demateralise, reform around Gallifrey and hollow Gallifrey out. Elements from this story were re-used by Adams in his script of The Pirate Planet. \\"Untitled storyline (Baker and Martin)\\" Proposed by Bob Baker and Dave Martin. It concerned two planets (Atrios and Zeos) at war over a catastrophic shift in their orbits. The war was being baited on a mysterious force. The Doctor was forced to make a temporary Key to Time to temporarily freeze both planets' armies. The Shadow (the mysterious force who was provoking the war) was planning to use the powers of the Key to time to pit the universe at war against everyone. His own shadow was the sixth segment. The Doctor thwarted the Shadow's plan by unfreezing both planet armies and giving each the co-ordinates of the Shadow's planet which just so happened to be in between both planets. Many elements of this story were recycled to create The Armageddon Factor. =Submitted for season 17= The Gamble With Time Written by David Fisher, it would have been set in 1920s Las Vegas and had The Doctor and Romana teaming up with a detective. Gambling was going to be a big focal point. It evolved into City of Death which was written by Douglas Adams and Graham Williams, under the pen name of David Agnew. Shada Shada was a six-part serial written by Douglas Adams that was to have concluded Series 17 in 1980.. Production was halted during filming due to a strike and never resumed,. although a reconstruction of the serial using narration and existing footage was later released on VHS in 1992. The story was later adapted by Big Finish in 2003 as a webcast production featuring Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor (and later released as an audio story that same year), while Adams himself reused elements from the serial for his first Dirk Gently novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. The story was novelised by Gareth Roberts in 2012, and completed with animation in 2017, with most of the original cast returning to play their original roles. Child Prodigy Written by Alistair Beaton & Sarah Dunant, this four-part story. was commissioned on 12 December 1978. The scripts were delivered on 5 January 1979 and rejected four days later as unacceptable. The Doomsday Contract For Season 17, John Lloyd, a frequent collaborator with script editor Douglas Adams, adapted material from his unpublished science fiction story GiGax. and in October 1978 submitted Shylock, a four-part serial written in Adams' light-hearted style. After providing a second draft of the storyline to modify parts of the script to avoid issues such as the rules involving child actors, Lloyd was forced to focus on his commitments as producer of Not the Nine O'Clock News.. Williams was still interested enough in the storyline that he made plans to involved writer Allan Prior to work on the scripts. The storyline was commissioned on 7 February 1979. and a script list dated 29 June 1979 links Lloyd and Prior to the project. Lloyd officially agreed to another writer taking on his story on 25 August 1979.. In the story, the Doctor is subpoenaed to appear in court when a corporation tries to buy Earth in order to obtain a matter- transmutation device.. Big Finish Productions has announced an audio adaptation of this story, written by Nev Fountain for their Lost Stories range, due to be released in November 2021. Erinella Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part story was commissioned on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella and two men fighting over a princess. The Doctor would become involved in his own timeline by arriving at the wrong time and becoming accused of being a poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission. The Secret of Cassius Written by Andrew Smith, this story was rejected by Read in August 1978.. The Tearing of the Veil Written by Alan Drury, the scripts were commissioned on 2 April 1979 for this four-part story. The story was set in the Victorian era and the entire action would take place in and around a vicarage. The vicar has recently died and fake spiritualists are exploiting the widow. The first episode would open with a seance during which the TARDIS would arrive. On 19 September 1979,. the story was accepted subject to alterations. Valley of the Lost Written by Philip Hinchcliffe, this story involved the Doctor and Romana encountering an alien Luron called Godrin who crash landed in a South American jungle in 1870.. Adams wrote to Hinchcliffe on 3 January 1979, explaining that the proposed script would be too costly to produce. It was later adapted as The Valley of Death by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in January 2012. \\"Untitled storyline (Adams)\\" Written by Douglas Adams, this story would involve the Doctor going into retirement but being constantly called upon to solve various problems. It was considered as the final story of Series 17 till Williams dismissed the idea. It was replaced by Shada. \\"Untitled storyline (Mills & Wagner)\\" Written by Pat Mills & John Wagner,. this story was submitted around the start of 1979. The story would involve a parallel universe in which the Roman Empire never fell. Mills & Wagner subsequently adapted it to become the comic story The Iron Legion for Doctor Who Weekly in late 1979. =Submitted for season 18= The Castle of Doom Written by David Fisher, this story was submitted by Fisher on 7 November 1979. John Nathan-Turner rejected it in favour of developing The Leisure Hive. The Dogs of Darkness Written by Jack Gardner, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 29 March 1980. and the scripts on 11 August 1980. It was still under consideration in April 1981, when Jack Gardner was asked to expand \\"The Dogs of Darkness\\" into full scripts for the Fifth Doctor for Season 19. Farer Nohan Written by Andrew Stephenson, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 18 March 1980.. Into the Comet Written by James Follett, this involved monsters attacking a race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Though the storyline was rejected by Adams, Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued. Invasion of the Veridians Written by Nabil Shaban (better known as Sil from the Colin Baker Doctor Who stories Vengeance on Varos and The Trial of a Time Lord) who was a longtime fan of Doctor Who and had previously suggested himself to replace the late Roger Delgado as the Master. In offering this script to the production office in 1980, Shaban also put himself forward as a potential successor to Tom Baker as the Doctor. Nothing came of Invasion of the Veridians.Doctor Who Magazine #309 Nabil Shaban had only written the first episode, it was written around the early 1970s, and was very much influenced by the Troughton/Pertwee era. Nabil believes that the only copy has now been lost to time, as he no longer has it.A Facebook conversation with Nabil Mark of Lumos Written by Keith Miles, a story outline for this four-part story was commissioned on 14 March 1980. Mouth of Grath Written by Malcolm Edwards & Leroy Kettle, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 18 March 1980. The Psychonauts Written by David Fisher, this story was discussed with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener. Romanoids Written by Geoff Lowe, this spec outline arrived at the production office in the summer of 1980. It was passed on to Nathan-Turner on 9 December 1980.. Sealed Orders Written by Christopher Priest, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 27 February 1980 and the full scripts on 24 March 1981.. The story, set on Gallifrey, involved hopping back and forth in time resulting in multiple variants of the TARDIS and a spare Doctor, one of whom was killed.'The Life and Scandalous Times of John Nathan-Turner' by Richard Marson, page 108. Miwk Publishing, 2013. The story was abandoned and replaced with Stephen Gallagher's Warriors' Gate. Soldar and the Plastoids Written by John Bennett, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 10 April 1980. Song of the Space Whale Space-Whale. was originally pitched by Pat Mills and his writing partner John Wagner in 1980 as a Fourth Doctor adventure.. When the production office showed some signs of interest, Wagner left the project and the script was commissioned as a four-part Fifth Doctor story for a scene breakdown on 7 September 1981 and full scripts on 2 December 1981. The new drafts reduced the humor and the renamed Song of the Space Whale was now planned as the third serial in Season 20 and intended to introduce new companion Vislor Turlough. The story concerned a group of people living in the belly of a giant whale in space.. The Doctor would find this out while attempting to protect the creature from being slaughtered by a rusting factory ship. The castaways living in the whale, as well as the ship's captain, would be working class characters, with the former's dialogue being based on that of a working-class Northern Irish family that Mills knew. During the writing, Mills and script editor Eric Saward \\"fundamentally disagreed\\" on the character of the captain (Saward wanting a more Star Trek-type figure) and the dialogue for the castaways. Mills has said that \\"there was a Coronation Street quality to it that Eric felt didn't work in space. He thought the future would be classless, and I didn't.\\"Interview with Mills in Deathray #12 Mills' disagreements with Saward led to the script being delayed until it was too late to serve as Turlough's introductory story.. The script was then considered for Season 21 and later still Season 22. By this point the script had been revised as two 45-minute episodes, but although it was still listed in July 1985 as an ongoing script, by November 1985 Nathan-Turner confirmed at a convention that the script had been dropped. The \\"Space Whale\\" concept was eventually revised and realised in the 2010 episode The Beast Below. The rejected script was later adapted as The Song of Megaptera by Mills for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in May 2010. \\"Untitled storyline (Brosnan)\\" Written by John Brosnan who submitted this idea sometime after Bidmead became script editor in January 1980. The story would have involved the Doctor arriving at the BBC Television Centre and meeting Tom Baker. The two would then pair up to combat a threat. Fifth Doctor =Submitted for season 19= The Enemy Within Written by Christopher Priest, the opportunity to write this four-part story. was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980. and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic tension between the two of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid.. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock. Genesis of the Cybermen Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part story was submitted on spec to the production office around February 1982.. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas at a point in time when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion \\"Felicity\\" arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting on the opposite side of the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any unconverted Mondasians with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in Genesis of the Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character \\"Felicity\\" rather than writing with any particular companion in mind. The fifth Doctor would later become involved with the creation of the Cybermen in the audio story, Spare Parts. Hebos Written by Rod Beacham, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 5 December 1980. Project Zeta Sigma The Fifth Doctor's first story was originally intended to be the four-part Project Zeta Sigma, written by John Flanagan & Andrew McCulloch, who had previously scripted Meglos. It was not intended to follow on directly from the events of Logopolis; instead, the Doctor and his companions would have already left Earth. The story was to concern nuclear disarmament. Commissioned as Project '4G' on 7 October 1980, the script proved unworkable, and producer John Nathan-Turner dropped the story on 19 February 1981.. He then commissioned recently departed script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to write a replacement which became Castrovalva. This last minute change disrupted the shooting schedule, meaning that Castrovalva would be the fourth serial of the series filmed, though it would be the first transmitted. The Psychrons Written by Terence Greer, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 13 June 1980. It was finally rejected sometime after April 1981 and was originally submitted featuring the Fourth Doctor. It is not known if the idea's development extended to the point that Greer would have had to modify it to include the Fifth Doctor. The Torson Triumvirate Written by Andrew Smith, a scene breakdown for this four-part story set on present-day Earth was commissioned on 25 November 1980. The story was still under consideration in April 1981. =Submitted for season 20= Parasites Written by Bill Lyons and also known as The Parasites, a scene breakdown was commissioned on 22 September 1981, with the scripts commissioned on 16 February & 23 April 1982 by which point it was being considered for Season 21.. Way Down Yonder Written by Lesley Elizabeth Thomas, a scene breakdown for this four-part story was commissioned on 23 April 1981. The story was abandoned at some point after November 1981. \\"Untitled storyline (Lee)\\" Written by Tanith Lee, the scripts for this four-part story were commissioned on 6 February 1981. =Submitted for 20th anniversary special= The Six Doctors Written by Robert Holmes,. this story was planned as the 20th anniversary special. The 90-minute single-part story was commissioned on 2 August 1982 and would involve the various Doctors and companions drawn to the planet Maladoom where they are trapped by the Master who is working for the Cybermen. The Cybermen want to isolate the genetic material that permits Time Lords to time travel freely so that they can incorporate that information into their own biology. The First Doctor would be revealed as an android, hence the title being the Six Doctors. Holmes made little headway with the script and withdrew from the project on 13 October 1982. =Submitted for season 21= Children of Seth After completing Snakedance, Saward requested that writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982. and was about the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a structure for the new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and a tangible villain for the Doctor to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.. Circus of Destiny Written by Ben Steed, this two-part story was delivered in January 1983. It was ultimately not taken forward.. The Darkness Eric Pringle submitted this storyline for a four-part story to the production office in August 1981 alongside The Awakening, but only the latter was developed further.

Ghost Planet Written by Robin Squire, this four-part story had a scene breakdown commissioned on 5 January 1983 and the scripts on 20 May 1983. The story may have been considered to incorporate the Sixth Doctor. Hex Written by Peter Ling & Hazel Adair, this story developed out of plans by producer Nathan-Turner to create a sequel to the 1960s soap opera Compact, entitled Impact.. When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered them the opportunity to write for Doctor Who as a form of compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four). was commissioned on 12 July 1983,. but after three months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected. The plot involves the disappearance of various people on Earth,. which leads the Doctor and Peri to the planet Hexagora where the Doctor becomes romantically involved with Queen Zafia. who is trying to save the insect race of Hexagora from destruction through a plan to infiltrate and take over Earth. It was later adapted as Hexagora by Paul Finch for Big Finish's The Lost Stories with Tegan and Nyssa in November 2011. The House That Ur-Cjak Built Written by Andrew Stephenson, a scene breakdown was commissioned on 10 June 1982. The Metraki Written by Andrew Smith, this story was submitted to the production office around 1983. This storyline led to Smith being commissioned for The First Sontarans. Nightmare Country Written by Stephen Gallagher,. this script was submitted in late 1982 but rejected by Saward on grounds of cost. The four-part story would involve the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough testing a Reality Simulator.

The Underworld Written by Barbara Clegg, this story was submitted in late 1982 and saw the Doctor travel down the River Styx in Ancient Greece where he would discover an alien race, the Hadeans, kidnapping the women of Greece due to their own race being rendered infertile. The story is unconnected to the similarly sounding Fourth Doctor story of the same name. Warmongers Written by Marc Platt and Charles M. Stevens (a pseudonym for J. Jeremy Bentham), this story was submitted on spec in 1983 and was discussed with Saward but not commissioned. This story dealt with Sontarans and Rutans in England during the 1940s blitz. The Zeldan Written by William Emms, this four-part storyline was discussed but not commissioned when Emms approached the production office in 1983. Sixth Doctor =Submitted for season 22= All scripts for this series were commissioned for the new 45 minute episode format.

Platt later adapted the story as a novel for the Virgin New Adventures range in February 1992. The First Sontarans Written by Andrew Smith, a scene breakdown had been commissioned on 10 January 1984.

Doomwraiths Written by Philip Martin, this story was submitted on 28 December 1983 and dealt with an alien race returning to Earth to discover their \\"humanity\\" experiment has failed. The story involved the TARDIS alerting the Doctor to the fact that a regeneration is in progress nearby, suggesting the presence of a fellow Timelord. The Doctor instead find the elite of the Doomwraiths emerging, reconstituted, as shimmering metal columns with many moving strips and a deadly purpose. The Wraiths find that human evolution has failed, and mankind has not taken on their form; they will thus release a plague to destroy humanity, relocate the missing section of genetic code and repopulate Earth themselves. The Doctor and Peri discover that the Doomwraiths themselves have a genetic flaw which gives them the impulse to destroy. The Doctor manages to destroy the discovered code block, but says that the Doomwraiths may have left their legacy on other worlds.DWM 309 pg 18 On 9 March 1984, Saward noted that the story idea would need further development before he could assess it for commissioning.

Valley of Shadows Written by Philip Martin, this story was submitted on 28 December 1983 and had the Doctor travel into the Egyptian underworld to save Peri. On 9 March 1984 Saward felt that the story idea needed further work before it could be considered for commissioning. \\"Untitled storyline (Pritchard)\\" Written by Bill Pritchard. \\"Untitled storyline (Wolfman)\\" Written by Jonathan Wolfman. =The Trial of a Time Lord candidates= After the decision was taken to cancel all the stories previously commissioned for Season 23, new stories were sought for the shortened 14 episode series. The plan was for three production blocks, divided up into two four-episode lots and one block of six episodes. Robert Holmes was assigned the opening four-part story and Philip Martin the second four-part story. The final six episodes were to be broken up into three two-part stories. Attack from the Mind Writer David Halliwell. was approached by Eric Saward in early July 1985 as a prospective writer for the \\"new\\" series 23.. Halliwell submitted his untitled first draft of the then untitled two-part story for episodes 9 & 10 . to the production office in late July 1985. The story dealt with a conflict between the ugly looking Freds and the beautiful Penelopeans. Work on a second draft began on 14 August 1985 and was completed by 22 August 1985, with a third draft submitted on 11 September 1985. Saward spent much time with Halliwell on further drafts, changing the name of the Freds to Trikes. The fourth revision was delivered on 26 September 1985. and 7 October 1985 saw a fifth draft arrive at the production office. Halliwell received a letter from Saward on 18 October 1985, advising him that Attack from the Mind had been cancelled. The Second Coming Written by Jack Trevor Story.. Story was invited to the same series briefing as David Halliwell, and this two-part story episodes 11 & 12 was meant to share sets with Attack from the Mind as well as being linked narratively. The plot centred on a man playing a saxophone inside an empty gasometer. With the dismissal of Halliwell and Story's scripts, Saward looked to replace them with a single four-part adventure. Pinacotheca Main Article: Pinacotheca Written by Christopher H. Bidmead, the story was commissioned on 29 October 1985 as The Last Adventure, this replaced the scripts by David Halliwell and Jack Trevor Story as episodes 9 – 12 . with second draft scripts of all four episodes delivered by 9 January 1986.

It involved the Doctor investigating the resort of Paradise Five, while Mel goes undercover as a hostess.. When this script too failed, it was replaced in turn by Pip & Jane Baker's Terror of the Vervoids. It was later adapted as Paradise 5 by Andy Lane for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in March 2010. Time Inc Time Inc was the title for the concluding two-part story-arc as to have originally been written by Robert Holmes for episodes 13 & 14 when commissioned on 4 February 1986.. However, Holmes was unable to work on the script past the first part due to his untimely death on 24 May 1986. Script editor Eric Saward was tasked with completing the story, his version of the script ending with the Doctor and the Valeyard locked in battle in the time vortex and no clear victor. This was disapproved by series producer John Nathan-Turner as being too down-beat and would end the show on an inconclusive moment should the BBC decide to cancel the series. The final episode was subsequently commissioned from Pip & Jane Baker by Nathan-Turner after Saward quit as script editor following the rejection of his proposed ending. =Mel introduction story= According to his book Doctor Who: The Companions (published at about the time The Trial of a Time Lord was broadcast), series producer John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's first meeting with Melanie Bush in a later episode. The subsequent dismissal of Colin Baker from the role of the Doctor rendered this potential storyline moot. Seventh Doctor =Submitted for season 24= “Untitled Pirate Storyline (Pip and Jane Baker)”Doctor Who episode ranking- The Seventh Doctor- retrieved from Snares, Josh- 2019 =Submitted for season 25= Knight Fall Written by Ben Aaronovitch, this story concerned privatisation. This idea was submitted in May 1987, the then script editor Andrew Cartmel liked some of the concepts, but he felt that it was generally inappropriate for Doctor Who, and that there were too many supporting characters. However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch more stories, and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks. Transit Main article: Transit =Submitted for season 26= Alixion Written by Robin Mukherjee, this three-part story had been considered for season 26 as the \\"spare\\" script. should another planned story become no longer suitable. The adventure was to take place on a monastic planet inhabited by humans and large beetles. The humans were monks who worked to provide a special elixir that enhanced intelligence. This elixir would be produced by the beetles feeding on intelligent beings. The abbot of the monastery wants to feed the Doctor to the beetles in order to produce a more potent elixir for himself. The script was not completed beyond a partial storyline. Mukherjee was unsure how events would have been resolved beyond a contest of wills between the Doctor and the abbot. Avatar Written by David A. McIntee, this was a four-part. Lovecraftian horror story set in Arkham, New England in 1927, although McIntee later began a rewrite to shift the action to Cornwall. The story involved alien bodysnatchers who could only inhabit the bodies of the dead. The villain of the piece would discover the remains of a Silurian god and try and clone itself a new body from the fossilized body. Illegal Alien Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, this was a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s. They had completed the first two episodes in script form and the final episode as a storyline, and were planning to submit it during the start of production on season 26. Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that submitting to script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) was a mistake and to instead submit it for the following series. Tucker & Perry later adapted the story as a novel for the BBC Past Doctors range in October 1997. Lungbarrow Main article: Lungbarrow Written by Marc Platt. The story was to feature the Doctor and Ace, who arrive at the former's ancestral home on the planet Gallifrey and meet his relatives. However, producer John Nathan- Turner argued that the script was \\"too revealing\\" of the Doctor's origins and it was replaced by Platt's late script, Ghost Light. Platt later adapted the story as a novel for the Virgin New Adventures range in March 1997. Shrine In 1988. writer Marc Platt discussed with script editor Andrew Cartmel an idea inspired by Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, concerning stone- headed aliens looking for their God-King in Tsarist 19th Century Russia. =Under consideration for season 27= Before the original Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans had been made for a proposed 27th season under the assumption that it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts as part of their The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), who was never named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth Chalmers.. Earth Aid The opening three-part, studio-bound story. and was to be written by Ben Aaronovitch; a space opera featuring a race of samurai insect- like aliens called the Metatraxi.. Earth Aid was to open with Ace in the captain's chair of a starship, and the story would concern the politics of humanitarian aid. The Metatraxi were originally conceived as part of a stage play entitled War World. Earth Aid (a title invented by Dave Owen for his \\"27 up\\" article in DWM.) was later adapted by Aaronovitch and Cartmel for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in July 2011. Cartmel is on record as preferring the title Bad Destination.. Thin Ice Main article: Thin Ice This four-parter, the second story of the proposed series, was to have been written by Marc Platt and was due to feature Ice Warriors in a London of 1968.. It would have seen the departure of Ace to the Prydonian Academy to become a Time Lord.. The story was to introduce a character with underworld connections who was intended to become a recurring character similar to the Brigadier. The character would have a daughter born at the conclusion of the adventure who would be named by the Doctor. The plot would have featured an Ice Warrior's armour in the London Dungeon and two reincarnated Warriors continuing a long rivalry. Platt also intended to have bikers being controlled by the Ice Warriors (and wearing similar helmets), scenes on a terraformed pastoral Mars, and a more mystical bent to the aliens while deepening their history.. Marc Platt has revealed that the name Ice Time was \\"only ever invented for an article in Doctor Who Magazine\\" (Dave Owen's \\"27 up\\" article). It was later adapted by Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in April 2011. An unrelated television story by the same name was aired in 2017 as part of Series 10. Crime of the Century Was to have been written by Andrew Cartmel, and would have introduced a cat burglar/safecracker as the next companion. The character with underworld connections from Thin Ice would be featured as an older individual and the father of the new companion. Crime of the Century (another title invented by Owen for \\"27 up\\") was later adapted by Cartmel for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in May 2011. Cartmel would have preferred to call the story Action at a Distance. The audio adaptation of Earth Aid makes references that this story takes place before it. This version also features Ace. Animal Cartmel had wanted to pen a story of his own. Animal (another title invented by Owen for \\"27 up\\") was later adapted by Cartmel for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in June 2011. Cartmel would have preferred to call the story Blood and Iron. Hostage Written by Neil Penswick, this was a three-part. futuristic thriller in which a group of soldiers are hunting down two shape-changing criminals called Butler and Swarfe. The cliffhanger to part one had Swarfe changing into a monster who then went on the hunt in part two. Penswick later adapted some material from this for his Virgin New Adventures novel The Pit in March 1993. Night Thoughts Written by Edward Young, this is a horror story set in an isolated house. It would feature a group of university staff, one who was a cripple, trapped in the house during winter. One of the characters would turn out to be a murderer. The story took its name and theme from the poem Night- Thoughts by Edward Young, namesake of the story's writer. It was later adapted by Young for Big Finish in February 2006. The adaptation featured the Seventh Doctor and Ace, as well as Big Finish-original companion Hex. A School for Glory Written by Tony Etchells & an unidentified writer, this was to be set during the Great War. The narrative was planned to alternate between the trenches and a British country house doubling as an army academy. =Submitted for 30th anniversary special= Destination: Holocaust Written by David Roden, this story involved the Doctor meeting with the Brigadier Lethbridge-Stuart fighting against Cybermen in a church. This story was dropped in favor of Dimensions in Time. Endgame Written by David Roden, this two-part story, would feature the Doctor and the Brigadier trying to save the Doctor's previous reincarnations from the powers of the Celestial Toymaker. Michael Gough turned down the role, and the story was replaced by Dimensions in Time. Lost in the Dark Dimension The first time the idea of a special video-only anniversary special was mooted was in a memo Nathan- Turner wrote to Head of Video Production Penny Mills on 18 February 1992. With Tom Baker not averse to appearing should conditions be met, serious thought was given to an original production and there was a meeting in June 1992 to discuss the concept of the special; by 21 July 1992 writer Adrian Rigelsford (later joined by Joanna McCaul) had completed an initial outline for the story entitled Timeflyers. Shortly afterwards the project was given the cover name The Environment Roadshow. A production office was opened for the project in the first week of September 1992 with shooting planned for January–February 1993. The script was sent to Peter Cregeen on 22 March 1993, indicating at the same time that Graeme Harper was being looked at as a potential director for the special. However, issues with budget plagued the production and shooting slipped to taking place November–December 1993 with a final delivery date of 14 March 1994. Around mid-May Cregeen indicated that he'd like to see the special broadcast on the BBC in November 1993. By the end of May 1993, the project was now being referred to as The Dark Dimension before a new working title of Lost in the Dark Dimension was settled on. Harper was contracted as the director of the special in June 1993 and intended Rik Mayall to play the part of the villain, Hawkspur. What was hoped to be the final shooting script was completed on 21 June 1993 and with the production now aimed for broadcast than a direct-to-video release, Alan Yentob gave the special the green light with the plan to have the completed project delivered by 27 November 1993 but by the start of July 1993, budget issues continued to plague the production and on 9 July 1993 the project was officially cancelled. With the project sunk, the thirtieth anniversary was instead celebrated with the light-hearted Children in Need charity special Dimensions in Time and the documentary 30 Years in the TARDIS. The BBC press release had hinted at the plot with the following: Eighth Doctor =1990s US reboot – Leekley bible= Early in the process that was to lead to the 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which detailed John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would likely have fallen to the BBC. The pilot was to feature the half-human Doctor seeking his father, Ulysses, through various time periods—contemporary Gallifrey (where Borusa dies and is merged with the TARDIS, and the Master becomes leader of the Time Lords), England during the Blitz, Ancient Egypt, and Skaro (where the Daleks are being created). Other proposed episodes in the bible included The Pirates, in which the Doctor teamed up with Blackbeard, and several remakes of stories from the classic series, including: * The Talons of Weng-Chiang, set in New York City * Earthshock, featuring the \\"Cybs\\" (Leekley's more piratical version of the Cybermen) * Horror of Fang Rock * The Celestial Toymaker, who was to have been under the control of the Master. * Don't Shoot, I'm the Doctor, a more historically accurate remake of The Gunfighters * Tomb of the Cybs, a remake of The Tomb of the Cybermen in which the Cybs are awoken by the Master * The Yeti, a remake of The Abominable Snowmen featuring the Dalai Lama and Sir Edmund Hillary * The Ark in Space Earlier versions of the bible included, among others: * The Cybs, a story set on Mars in which the Doctor escapes capture by hiding in a gold mine * A remake of The Sea Devils, set in a Louisiana oil rig * The Outcasts, in which the Cybs would attack Gallifreyan outcasts * The Land of Fear, a conflation of The Reign of Terror and The Claws of Axos * A remake of The Dæmons, set in Salem, Massachusetts * A completed version of Shada, which would have introduced Romana and Professor Chronotis as Romana's uncle. Leekley's scripts were not well received at Amblin or elsewhere; and in September 1994, he was removed from the project. Ninth Doctor =\\"Untitled storyline (Abbott)\\"= Written by Paul Abbott, this episode was intended for episode 11 of Series 1. With Jack Harkness having joined the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler, Rose feels left out. But when they land in Pompeii in 79 AD, Jack discovers that Rose's life has been manipulated by the Doctor in an experiment to create the perfect companion. Abbott's commitment to Shameless and other projects led to him dropping out of the episode. Russell T Davies took over and wrote \\"Boom Town\\" in its place. =Mr. Sandman= Written by Mark Gatiss, this episode concerned an alien entity living inside a song, anyone who listened to the melody would turn into faceless creatures. It evolved into The Idiot's Lantern. Tenth Doctor =\\"Untitled Episode\\"= For Series 2 of 2006, an untitled episode set at Buckingham Palace, concerned Queen Victoria getting an alien insect in her eye. The setting was eventually changed to the Torchwood Estate and the alien being changed to a werewolf. For the same series, episode 11 involved a villain who has discovered how to drain things of their beauty, and has reduced his planet to a sterile grey landscape. =\\"Untitled 1920s storyline\\"= The revived Doctor Who series was to feature a script by Stephen Fry, set in the 1920s. Rumours appeared on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1. and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point.. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time. for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, \\"They asked me to do a series and I tried, but I just ran out of time, and so I wrote a pathetic letter of \\"I'm sorry I can't do this\\" to Davies.\\". =Century House= A \\"companion-lite\\" episode, Century House was written by Tom MacRae for Series 3 of the revived show. The Doctor was to appear on a live broadcast of Most Haunted, investigating a house haunted by the \\"Red Widow\\", with Martha Jones watching at home as a framing device. The episode did not fit into the production schedule, and was pushed back to Series 4 and reworked such that the show was watched by Donna Noble and her mother Sylvia. Due to dissatisfaction with the premise, and to avoid two comedic episodes in the same series, the episode was dropped and replaced with Davies' Midnight. This premise was expanded upon for the Doctor Who Audio Drama, No Place. =\\"Untitled storyline (Davies)\\"= Russell T Davies scrapped a glass bowl storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided this would make the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he was glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise. =The Suicide Exhibition= During the Second World War, a Nazi task force assaults the Natural History Museum in London, which has been overrun by monsters. Later action would have involved the discovery of a secret chamber beneath the museum. This episode was written by Mark Gatiss and planned to air in the fourth series of Doctor Who, but was replaced by The Fires of Pompeii. Elements of the story were later reused in Steven Moffat's The Big Bang, the finale of Series 5. =\\"Untitled 2008 Christmas special\\"= On Christmas Eve, an alien creature attaches itself to author J.K. Rowling. Suddenly, the real world is replaced by a magical reality influenced by the writer's own imagination. The Doctor must battle witches and wizards to reach Rowling and put the world to rights. =\\"A Midwinter's Tale\\" (Davies/Ford)\\"= A family goes to a hotel with their gran, (a role which Davies hoped would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family so much that she wants them to disappear as they then do. She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars. =\\"Untitled Final David Tennant Special\\"= This was a storyline that Russell T Davies thought up as a final one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (this was going to air around Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.). The plot would have been that the Doctor finds a spaceship with an alien family on board (Russell mockingly titled them 'The Prostetix Family'.) where the ship was broken, in the special he would have to sacrifice his life to save this family. This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became \\"The End of Time\\" that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Prostetix family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Addams and Rossiter. Eleventh Doctor =\\"Untitled storyline (Graham)\\"= Written by Matthew Graham and planned for the 2010 series, to be about an old people's home and a lighthouse that was a spaceship. Trips to the US, and Graham's work on Ashes to Ashes precluded him from developing the storyline to script stage. =\\"Death to the Doctor\\"= Written by Gareth Roberts. Before settling upon the storyline that would become The Lodger, Roberts initially developed a different storyline for the 2010 series which would have featured a disgraced Sontaran called Strom. This idea reached draft stage before being abandoned altogether. However the idea of Strom was later recycled into Sontaran Commander Strax, who first appeared in A Good Man Goes to War and became a recurring character. =\\"Love and War\\"= Paul Cornell was invited by showrunner Steven Moffat to work on a script idea for inclusion in series 5. Initially, Moffat suggested the possibility of adapting Cornell's Virgin New Adventure novel \\"Love and War\\", originally published in 1992. Big Finish would later produce an audio adaption of this novel twenty years later in 2012. = \\"Fear Itself\\" = Cornell's Doctor Who short story \\"The Hopes and Fears of All the Years\\" was also considered as a possibility for adaption, previously published by The Daily Telegraph in 2007. The short story involves the Doctor visiting a little boy every Christmas Day through to adulthood with the foreknowledge that the Doctor is destined to save the boy's life. A similar idea was later used in Moffat's 2010 Christmas special \\"A Christmas Carol\\", much to Cornell's annoyance at the time. As it was clear that Cornell would not be writing the Christmas special, it was decided to use the boy's birthday instead. Cornell worked on six drafts of the script before it became apparent that the cost of depicting many different time periods, including two world wars, in one episode would be too prohibitive. It was then hoped by the production team that the idea could be reworked for inclusion in Series 6, however this came to nothing.  Twelfth Doctor  = \\"Untitled vampire story (Cornell)\\" = Paul Cornell was invited by script editor Derek Ritchie to attend pitch session for Series 8. At which, Cornell proposed a storyline that involved Clara, later the Doctor at Moffat's suggestion, being turned into a vampire. However, this came to nothing. = \\"Pride and Prejudice and Daleks\\" = After the submission of his untitled vampire story, Paul Cornell submitted a storyline idea titled \\"Pride and Prejudice and Daleks\\", which would have taken place in the Land of Fiction, previously seen in the 1969 story \\"The Mind Robber\\". However, Cornell was informed that the idea was too similar to a script already in development by another writer and so they would not be able to develop the idea with Cornell any further. = \\"Sleep No More sequel\\" = Written by Mark Gatiss. After Sleep No More aired, Gatiss had initially developed a sequel that would have pre-empted the story by being set Thousands of years before Gagan Rassmussen's Morpheus process experiments at the Le Verrier where the Doctor discovers the same process being experimented on Earth. The script was changed once Gatiss had found out that showrunner Steven Moffat was leaving and the story he was doing would have been his last for the show, he instead pitched \\"The Empress of Mars\\". Unmade television spin- offs Several proposals for Doctor Who spin-offs have been proposed, including one featuring the Doctor's friends Professor George Litefoot and Henry Gordon Jago from The Talons of Weng Chiang,. =Young Doctor Who= A children's show featuring \\"Young Doctor Who\\" was vetoed by Russell T Davies and replaced by The Sarah Jane Adventures The series was pitched as a series focusing on The Doctor as a teenage boy, supposedly building sonic screwdrivers and expressing his love for the universe. The series never reached production due to the worry that it would ruin the mystery surrounding the Doctors origins.. Other productions proceeded further along. =The Daleks= On 1 November 1966, Dalek creator Terry Nation pitched a spin-off series The Daleks to the BBC, writing a thirty-minute teleplay entitled \\"The Destroyers\\" as a possible pilot episode for an American coproduction. The Daleks was to have focused on the adventures of the SSS. Lead characters included agents Captain Jack Corey, David Kingdom, his sister Sara Kingdom (from the Doctor Who story The Daleks' Masterplan, in which Kingdom died) and Mark Seven, an android. On 22 November 1966, the BBC informed Nation that they were no longer interested in the project. The pilot episode was adapted by Nicholas Briggs and John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range for an audio story released in December 2010 and included on The Second Doctor Boxset, although it did not feature the Doctor himself. =Nelvana cartoon series= Concept art of the planned Doctor Who animated series by Nelvana In 1990, following the cancellation of the live action series, the BBC approached the Canadian animation house Nelvana to propose an animated continuation of the show. The cartoon series was to feature an unspecified new Doctor, incorporating elements of various BBC series Doctors. It was not to be more oriented towards young audience than the live action series; rather, it was intended to be a continuation of the cancelled series in animated form in order to save costs, with design elements that would promote merchandise sales. According to Nelvana's Ted Bastien: \\"We went through a lot of development on it, then we were scripting and storyboarding it and about four scripts had been written. It happened really fast\\". Concept art was prepared depicting several possible versions of the Doctor based on actors such as Peter O'Toole, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd with elements of the wardrobes of previous Doctors. Production sketches also showed new versions of allies such as K-9 and enemies such as the Daleks and Cybermen. The Master was to be \\"half man, half robot with a cybernetic bird accessory and a face modeled after Sean Connery\\". The show was also to feature female companions from Earth, and space battles which the BBC would not have been able to afford for the live action series. The series would have been Nelvana's biggest show to date. According to Bastien, \\"it was pulled out from under us\\" after a British animation studio told the BBC that it could do what Nelvana intended for a much lower price. The project did not proceed further and no pilot was produced. =K-9 and Company= Elisabeth Sladen was approached to return to Doctor Who as Sarah Jane Smith to help with the transition between Tom Baker and Peter Davison, but resisted the offer. Following the outcry after K-9 was removed from the show, producer John Nathan-Turner proposed a spin-off featuring the two characters. A single episode, \\"A Girl's Best Friend\\", was produced as a pilot for a proposed series, and broadcast by BBC1 as a Christmas special on 28 December 1981, but the series was not taken up. The basic premise of a series centered on Sarah Jane Smith was reused by Big Finish with the Sarah Jane Smith audio series and in the TV Series The Sarah Jane Adventures just over 25 years later. =Rose Tyler: Earth Defence= When it was decided that Billie Piper would leave the series at the end of Series 2, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies considered giving her character Rose Tyler her own 90-minute spin-off production, Rose Tyler: Earth Defence, with the possibility of such a special becoming an annual Bank Holiday event. The special would have picked up from Rose's departure in Doomsday in which Rose joins the Torchwood Institute of a parallel Earth. The special was officially commissioned by Peter Fincham, the Controller of BBC One, and assigned a production budget. Davies changed his mind while filming Piper's final scenes for Series 2 of Doctor Who. He would later call Earth Defence \\"a spin-off too far,\\" and decided that for the audience to be able to see Rose when the Doctor could not would spoil the ending of Doomsday. The production was cancelled. Davies said Piper had been told about the idea, but the project ended before she was formally approached about starring in it.. The plot element of Tyler working with an alternative Earth's Torchwood to defend the Earth would be revisited towards the end of Series 4 in 2008. Television spin-off series =The Sarah Jane Adventures= Series 4 =\\"Untitled storyline (Ford)\\"= Written by Phil Ford. A story idea considered for the first and second episodes of the fourth series. Set at Park Vale Comprehensive School, it would have concerned an Aztec priestess who had lived for thousands of years and was now working there as an English teacher. =Don't Sit Too Close to the Screen= Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the third and fourth episodes of the fourth series. It involved a new children's television show that causes its viewer to become possessed. The aliens responsible harness electrical impulses in the viewers' brains, their aim being to eradicate humanity so that they can live uninterrupted in the electricity. =Supermarket Sweep= Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the third and fourth episodes of the fourth series. It concerned an alien operating out of a supermarket with a voice coming over a tannoy into the empty store. The focus of story would be Luke and K9, with Luke combating the alien alone like the 1988 action movie Die Hard. =Underground= Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the third and fourth episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the old childhood game of not standing on the cracks between paving slabs. =Wallpaper= Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the third and fourth episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of \\"faces\\" which people used to be able to see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through them. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors. =\\"Untitled storyline (Roberts)\\"= Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. Sarah Jane would have, as a result of a lightning storm, come face to face with her father who has been dead for over 55 years. =The Children of Blackmere Rise= Written by Rupert Laight. A story idea considered for the ninth and tenth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Rani investigating a strange council estate, as part of her Journalism course, to find all its inhabitants possessed by an alien egg. =The Web of Lies= Written by Gary Russell. A story idea considered for the eleventh and twelfth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being controlled by a trio of giant spiders from Metabelis III previously featured in the Doctor Who story Planet of the Spiders in which Sarah Jane had appeared. =Sarah Jane and the Return of the Spiders= Written by Joseph Lidster. A variant on Gary Russell's \\"The Web of Lies\\" proposal. =Servant of the Spiders= Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. A second variant on Gary Russell's \\"The Web of Lies\\" proposal. =Miracle on Bannerman Road= Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. It was planned that series four would conclude with a Christmas special. It would have been a pastiche of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with Sarah Jane being shown Christmas past, present and future by a guide. Tom Baker (who had played the Fourth Doctor) was considered at one point for the role of the guide. =Everyone's Asleep= Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the fourth series. An alien causes the entire population of the UK to fall asleep in order to execute a bizarre plan. This idea later formed the basis for The Empty Planet. =Sarah Jane Goes Back to the Future= Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the fourth series. Rani, Clyde and Luke return to the 1970s in order to save the lives of Rani's parents. =School Trip= Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the fourth series. During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in distress and have to help it without revealing its presence to the rest of their friends. This notion was conceived as a \\"Sarah Jane-lite\\" narrative which would allow Elisabeth Sladen a break in production. =Time Team= Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the fourth series and inspired by the Channel 4 archaeology series Time Team. An archaeological dig would have discovered Sarah Jane's distinctive Nissan Figaro from where it had been buried thousands of years ago. =Trinity Wells Investigates= Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the fourth series, it would have seen the character of Trinity Wells, an American news anchor who had appeared in regular cameo appearances on Doctor Who, investigating a series of strange events occurring in Ealing and surrounding Sarah Jane. \\"Untitled storyline (Roberts)\\" Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea considered for the fourth series, it would have seen Rani's mother and father being abducted by the Russian counterpart of Torchwood. Series 5 Production on the spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures was brought to a premature close due to the death of series star Elisabeth Sladen. This left several planned scripts and storyline ideas unused for Series 5 and 6. =Meet Mr. Smith= Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. Planned for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fifth series, and would have seen Mr. Smith, Sarah Jane's alien computer, adopting a human form. =The Thirteenth Floor= Written by Phil Ford. Planned for the ninth and tenth episodes of the fifth series, it would have focused on Clyde and Rani and seen them trapped in the lift of a tower block and spending decades alone together. This script was reworked by Ford into the Wizards vs Aliens Series 2 story of the same name. =The Battle of Bannerman Road= Written by Russell T. Davies. Planned for the eleventh and twelfth episodes of the fifth series, it would have featured the revelation that Sky was actually the child of the Trickster. It would also have seen the return of Katy Manning as Jo Grant Jones and the destruction of Bannerman Road. =Full Moon= Written by Clayton Hickman.

Set at Halloween, it would have seen the gang transported back to the years 1911 and 1934. =\\"Untitled storyline (Hickman)\\"= Written by Clayton Hickman. Planned as a Halloween special for a Live 2011 broadcast. Set at Halloween, it would have seen an encounter with an hideous gargoyle-like creature. =Night of the Spectre= Written by Phil Ford. Planned as an animated Halloween special for a 2011 broadcast. It would have seen the return of former series regular Maria Jackson and her father Alan who had since moved to the USA. Series 6 The Sarah Jane Adventures ended as of Series 5 which was only half complete. There were plans to bring Ace back in Series 6 and there was also a possibility of the series rebooting itself to a new location but because the series was suspended during mid production of Series 5, there's no certainty of what would happen next. After the events of The Battle of Bannerman Road, Sarah Jane would have either stayed on Bannerman Road or left for new adventures in Foxgrove which was previously seen in Series 2 (The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith). The Battle of Bannerman Road (Series 5 finale) had a bunch of ideas and developments that were planned out but the episode itself never reached script form which means there are several possible outcomes of where the series could have gone but it would all depend on how Series 5 draws its conclusion. \\"Untitled storyline (Davies)\\" Written by Russell T. Davies. It would have seen the return of the Seventh Doctor's companion Ace and explained how Ace left the Doctor and what had happened to her since then. =Torchwood= Checkout Written by Joseph Lidster as an \\"over-commission\\" for Series 2. After a series of other story pitches, Lidster was asked to work on one of Russell T Davies's standby plots concerning a spooky 24-hour supermarket to center on Jack and Ianto. Described as \\"Die Hard in a Supermarket\\", it was set after Ianto's imperfect resurrection from the dead (as was originally planned, before this storyline shifted to Owen). The store would have been possessed by a demonic creature from the Rift that manifested only late at night and which fed off of human life-force. Ianto would have able to save the day due to being already dead and got Maggie, the supermarket's last customer, out alive. Whilst Lidster was working on the treatment, Davies decided to reclaim the idea for use as the opening episode of Series 2.Davies, Russell T; and Cook, Benjamin (2008). Page 32. Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale. London: BBC Books. Pressure from other projects meant Davies was only able to write the first scene of the episode, after which it was handed over to Chris Chibnall who incorporated it into what would become the episode \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\". Davies was impressed with a scene from Lidster's treatment involving Ianto and Maggie on the supermarket roof and asked him to use it in an episode based around their relationship, a dead man helping a grieving widow stay alive, which became the episode \\"A Day In The Death\\", which would now feature Owen in place of Ianto.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 34-35 The supermarket concept was also considered for use as an episode of Sarah Jane Adventures (see above section) under the working title of \\"Supermarket Sweep\\". Into the Silence Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the second series, it would have seen Jack being transported to Hell by a malevolent cab driver. It was later reworked by Lidster as the Torchwood audiobook Into the Shadows.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 35 Communion Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the second series, it would have involved a Messiah-like figure controlling nightclubbers. The plot shares similarities with Lidster's 2002 Doctor Who audio drama \\"The Rapture\\". Children Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea considered for the second series, it would have seen a serial killer targeting former classmates of Gwen's. Deadline Written by Phil Ford. This story idea was planned as fourth episode of Series 2. It originated from a strange phone Russell T Davies recalled having where the line suddenly went dead followed another person's voice speaking. The episode would have focused on Owen and have involved his medical background as something in the phones causes a series of suicides across Cardiff. Ford completed two drafts of the script before being asked to instead work on that year's finale episode for Sarah Jane Adventures. By the time he had returned to work on the episode plans for Series 2 had changed significantly. The story arc for series two now involved Owen (rather than Ianto) being killed mid-season and returned to life in an undead state, meaning that the story no longer fit Owen. Ford instead began work on a different episode for Series 2 which would be broadcast as \\"Something Borrowed\\". After the collapse of Phil Ford's version of the script, Joseph Lidster was invited to develop the idea as \\"1471\\" before it was finally reworked by Ford into the Torchwood radio play \\"The Dead Line\\".Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 36-37 Cross My Palm with Silver Written by James Moran. This story idea started out as an earlier version of what would become \\"Sleeper\\". The character of Beth had originally been envisaged as a fake fortune teller who was made her predictions come true with her unknown telekinetic abilities.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 38-39 Unplugged Written by James Moran. The story would seen Toshiko having to cope without the use of gadgets or weaponry.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 39 Ooze Written by James Moran. A story idea considered for Series 2, it would seen a group of Neo-Nazis targeting ethnic minorities with an alien weapon that caused the victims to lose all their bones. The Jinx Written by Andrew Cartmel a former script editor for Doctor Who. Initially pitched for Series 2, it involved a curse being put on Gwen. Development stalled due to it conflicting with the death of Ianto/Owen storyline and Gwen and Rhys' wedding in \\"Something Borrowed\\". It was then hoped to be part of Series 3 until it was abandoned in favor of the five episode Children of Earth storyline.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 40-42 Diplomatic Mission Written by Andrew Cartmel. A story idea considered for the second series, it involved a group of aliens attempting to close the Rift by destroying Earth.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 42 The Rift Preservation Society Written by Andrew Cartmel. A story idea considered for Series 2, it involved a group of eco-warriors who see the Rift as a natural force that shouldn't be interfered with. Babymother Written by Andrew Cartmel. A story idea considered for the second series, it involved a single mother on a sinister housing estate being controlled by an alien cuckoo that has taken the form of her baby. It was later reworked by Cartmel as the Torchwood short story \\"The Wrong Hands\\" which featured as part of the Consequences anthology. Dominant Life Form Written by Andrew Cartmel. A story idea considered for Series 2, it would have seen the Torchwood SUV being possessed by an alien consciousness. Revenants Written by Joseph Lidster. This story idea started out as an earlier version of what would become \\"A Day in the Death\\". It would have focused on Ianto coming to terms with his recent death and involved a group of people affected by various near-death experiences being targeted by an \\"angel of death\\". SkyPoint Written by Phil Ford. A story idea considered for the second series, it would have seen an alien creature living in an apartment block where other residents are going missing. It was later reworked by Ford into the Torchwood novel of the same name.Torchwood: The Official Magazine, Issue 24, Page 43 \\"Unused Miracle Day storyline (Davies, Espersorn and Chibnall)\\" In the episode commentary of the Torchwood: Miracle Day episode The Blood Line, Russell T. Davies talked about a storyline which was an early version of the Miracle Day storyline that was for thirteen episodes of the season which was devised by Russell T. Davies, Jane Esperson and Chris Chibnall. (who wrote episodes for the first two series.) In this storyline, many of the episodes would have been kept the same but the episode \\"Immortal Sins\\" would have killed off the character of Andy Davidson. He would have become a Category One. This may have also been in a different place in the thirteen episode version. The final two episodes would have been \\"The Blood Line\\" up until the thirteenth episode in where the Blessing would have started to kill people in Shanghai and Buenos Aires, resulting in the Blessing sites having to be blown up or otherwise destroyed.Davies, Russell T; and Gardner, Julie (2011). Torchwood: Miracle Day. BBC Worldwide. Proposed films In the mid-1960s, two motion pictures starring Peter Cushing as the non-canon \\"Dr. Who\\" (a human in the films) were produced, based on the television stories The Daleks and The Dalek Invasion of Earth. Since then, there have been periodic further attempts to adapt Doctor Who as a feature film. =Marco Polo adaptation= The Walt Disney corporation had expressed interest in a remake of the Doctor Who serial Marco Polo as a straight historical adventure film with the element of Doctor and his companions removed. = Daleks vs. Mechons = In issue 461 of Doctor Who Magazine, it was revealed that a third Peter Cushing Dr. Who film entitled Daleks vs. Mechons, to be based on The Chase, was in production; but because of the poor box office returns from Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., the project was cancelled. =Doctor Who Meets Scratchman= An artist's impression of a poster for Doctor Who Meets Scratchman. Featured in Doctor Who Magazine #379, artwork by Brian Williamson During spare time in filming, Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) and Ian Marter (Harry Sullivan), who later novelised several Doctor Who scripts for Target Books, wrote a script for a Doctor Who film which they entitled Doctor Who Meets Scratchman (alternatively Doctor Who and the Big Game). The script. saw the Doctor encounter the Devil (who called himself Harry Scratch or Scratchman), the Daleks, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones and, briefly, the Greek god Pan. At times Vincent Price and Twiggy were associated with the production. Price would have played the villain Harry Scratch and Twiggy a replacement female companion after Elisabeth Sladen had left the TV series.. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, with the Doctor, Harry and Sarah dodging balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. Up until the late 1970s, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. In an interview in 1975, Baker had referred to the flaws of the two Peter Cushing Dalek films in the 1960s, saying \\"There have been two Doctor Who films in the past, both rather poor... There are many dangers in transporting a television series onto the big screen... a lot of things that you could get away with on the small screen wouldn't wash in the cinema.\\" At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were dropped. With the release of Star Wars, it also seemed futile for a movie of this kind to even try to compete. In late January 2019, BBC Books released a novelization of the screenplay by Tom Baker himself, co-written with James Goss, coming a year after Goss had adapted Krikkitmen (see below). =Lacuna film proposals (1987–1994)= As the original Doctor Who series was nearing its end and continuing during the first interregnum (1989–1996), numerous attempts were made to adapt the series for the big screen for the first time since the Peter Cushing films of the 1960s. Jean-Marc Lofficier, in his book The Nth Doctor, profiles a number of film proposals, some of which came close to being produced. Ultimately, however, the only film version of Doctor Who (other than the two Cushing films) produced to date has been the 1996 made- for-TV film which was developed as a continuation of the TV series rather than a reboot or reimagining of the concept.. At one point, the film had the full working title, Doctor Who: The Last of the Time Lords. Among the script proposals profiled by Lofficier are several submissions by Doctor Who and Space: 1999 alumnus Johnny Byrne, plus others by Robert DeLaurentis, Adrian Rigelsford, John Leekley, Mark Ezra and Denny Martin Flinn. The title \\"Last of the Time Lords\\" would later be used by Russell T Davies for an episode in 2007. Other related works =Radio series= During the late sixties, a radio series starring Peter Cushing, who had played a human version of Doctor called \\"Dr. Who\\" in feature films featuring the Daleks, had been planned to be produced. A collaboration between Stanmark Productions and Watermill Productions, a pilot had been recorded and a further 52 episodes were to be produced. The pilot story titled \\"Journey into Time\\"' featured The Doctor and his granddaughter travel to the time of the American Revolution. The script was written by future Doctor Who television series writer Malcolm Hulke. The recording remains lost. A full transcript of the first episode appears in the magazine Nothing at the End of the Lane, Issue 3. =War World= Proposed stage play written by Ben Aaronovitch and Andrew Cartmel set at partly in space. It would have opened at a hippy festival at Stonehenge, it would featured honor-obsessed insect aliens called the Metraxi, a \\"data vampire\\", space pirates and revealed the real purpose of Stonehenge: to protect Earth against alien threats, as posited by a hippy at the festival. It was replaced by Terrance Dicks's The Ultimate Adventure. =Doctor Who webcast= In 2003, the BBC announced the return of Doctor Who, as a series of webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online text short story entitled \\"The Feast of the Stone\\". Work was already well underway on another webcast story entitled Blood of the Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. Before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as its showrunner. Blood of the Robots was never made. Blood of the Robots synopsis: \\"A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.\\" See also * Doctor Who: The Lost Stories References  Bibliography   . * . * . * . * . * . . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .  * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * External links Unmade Serials Doctor Who serials Unmade Serials Unproduced television episodes ","title":"List of unmade Doctor Who serials and films"},{"id":"9751981","text":"The Welaka State Forest is in the U.S. state of Florida.

The cross is perhaps early fifteenth century; the steps may be more recent. The site is marked as \\"Bevis's Cross\\" on a map of 1769 and as \\"Bevis Stone\\" on one of 1772, close to where the River Avon used to flow into the Severn, about halfway between the sites of the later Avonmouth and Marine Hotels (which have both since been demolished). Its position is now in the middle of the Royal Edward Dock, Avonmouth. Since the 1870s, the Avon has flowed into the Severn about half a mile further south. Purpose The purpose of the cross seems most likely to have been to mark the old mouth of the Avon, the access to the port of Bristol, for the benefit of sailors approaching from the south and turning upriver north of the now vanished Dumball Island. Local tradition has it that sailors used it to show their gratitude to God for their safe return by leaving donations for the Church, and there is a hole in one of the steps which is said to have received their coins. The origin of the name is uncertain. There is a Bevis Cross in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, which may be relevant because of the similar name. There may be an echo in both cross-names of the medieval legendary hero Sir Bevis of Hampton, and it may or may not be a coincidence that the site of Bewys Cross was in the tithing of Shirehampton, which was in early medieval times called simply Hampton. There is a mention in 1551Bristol Archives document P.Hen/Ch/1/7 of a place called Bewehurste at Compton in the nearby parish of Almondsbury, which is of uncertain relevance. The current name might result from confusion with Bewell's Cross in Bristol, or the Compton name. Location The local \\"squires\\", the Miles family, had the cross moved from the riverbank and re-erected in Kingsweston Lane, nearly opposite the entrance to their mansion, King's Weston House, probably at some time between 1863 and 1868. They may have done this to safeguard it against the threat of development taking place on their estate land at Avonmouth. The most likely context is the construction in 1863–1865 of the Bristol Port and Pier Railway, which terminated at the Avonmouth Hotel, just beyond the seabank. It was said in 1868 to be covered with ivy, but three years is quite enough time for that to happen. In 1952 or 1954, the subsequent owners of the Kingsweston estate, Bristol City Council, moved the cross to the grounds of The House in the Garden, a nearby house which had been built in 1938 for the widow of the last squire. It still stands there by the fishpond.

Events On February 27, at about 10 am local time, a suicide bomber attacked the outer gate of the base, killing 23 people and injuring at least 20 others.

US Vice President Dick Cheney was on the base at the time of the attack, having arrived in Afghanistan the previous day to meet with US Allies. US officials reported that the Vice President was never in danger and he was about 1 mile away from the explosion. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, told the Associated Press that the Taliban had advance knowledge of Cheney's visit and Cheney was the intended target—claims that were met with skepticism by US officials.

They are used for the sport of kiteboarding. They can be identified by a flat, swept-back profile and concave trailing edge allowing the kite greater depower. Bow kite design was pioneered by Bruno Legaignoux,Bow Portrait and have been licensed to many kite manufacturers. The first major manufacturer to introduce these bow kites to the United States was Cabrinha Kites. Bow kites have a wider wind range than C-kites (traditional LEI kites), so two kite sizes (such 7m² and 12m²) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75 kg rider. This makes bow kites more suitable for beginners to kite sports; however, they are also used by professionals. Bow kites are used in a variety of kite related sports, including kitesurfing and snowkiting. Because of their depower range, they allow users to combat problems caused by gusts, making them safer to use. They are also used by kooks for riding, as their unique shape lends itself to this discipline. Early kites While early bow kites allowed kite to be fully depowerable, they had a number of disadvantages compared to classic C-kites. These included: * They can get inverted and not fly properly * They are a bit twitchy and not as stable * They have heavier bar pressure, which makes them more tiring to fly * They are more difficult to relaunch (except if they are on the leading edge). * They lack a \\"sled boosting\\" effect when jumping (The jumps are higher and longer, but the technique for jumping is different). Later bow kites In 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine 100% depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, less performance penalties and reduced bar pressure. The bridle and control bar design has later been refined to give a more direct feel and less bar pressure while small modifications to the kites themselves has provided more stable kites less likely to invert. Ongoing developments are bringing improvements to this style of kite every year and they are now extremely popular with riders of all abilities. Safety Although bow kites make kite flying safer, it is always advisable to seek professional training, as accidents can still occur.

History The group performed as the Kipper Family throughout the 1980s and released several cult albums. Partly parodying the Copper Family, they performed their variations of traditional folk songs, with lyrics twisted to take in themes including cross-dressing, under-age sex, homosexuality at sea and the dissection of human cadavers. Although frequently macabre in theme, the Kipper Family were widely respected as accomplished folk artists and are remembered fondly. In the early days the Kipper Family would perform to crowds expecting an ordinary folk act, firmly staying in character during the whole period in the public eye, and it would be several songs into the set before the penny dropped. Later recordings include \\"We're Norfolk and Good\\", \\"Arrest These Merry Gentlemen\\" and \\"Bored of the Dance\\" and also a folk opera The Crab Wars. In addition to the released LPs, Christmas with the Kippers, a Christmas special, was recorded for BBC Radio Two. They were seen once on British television. The children's programme 'Get Fresh' featured a spaceship that would arrive in a different location each Saturday morning. One Saturday the destination was Trunch, and who should be there but Sid and Henry. The duo split at the end of 1991. In 2006, Sugden presented a series of podcasts for Channel 4 radio called The Kipper Country Code, as Sid Kipper. Chris Sugden has now retired the character of Sid Kipper. Characters The duo would put on Norfolk accents and delivered Norfolk inspired humour. Their appearance was just like any other folk singers. Sid with slicked back hair, a smart suit and a kipper tie, the look of a spiv. And Henry (Nudds made to look like an old man) with a threadbare cardigan and string to hold up his trousers in place of a belt. Often, as with all great comedy doubles, they would swap being one down or one up with their replies: :Henry: If you are trying to be clever with me, you're wastin' your time. :Sid: That's true yes. The fictional village of St. Just-near-Trunch is known as the home of the Kipper Family. When the duo split in 1991, Henry Kipper was pronounced dead. Sugden felt that he had to kill off the character as people kept asking when Henry would return.

Château Bayard has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1915. Château de Bayard (ruines) The castle has housed the Bayard museum since 1975; it presents the life and the myth of Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard, the famous \\"knight without fear and without reproach\\" ().  History  Originally, the Château Bayard was just a fortified manor house. In the feudal age, only a Lord could own a castle. Pierre Terrail, first of the name (the family is also called LeVieux - \\"the old\\") and great-grandfather of the renowned knight, was vice-lord of the lord of Avallon. It has always been important since the castle has been built and restored, that it stay clean. Starting in 1404, Pierre Terrail undertook the construction of his residence in a place called Bayard, near Pontcharra. Even if it were only a strong house, the building he made was however far from being negligible: illustrations of the 19th century show a residence protected by four round towers, raised on three levels of mullioned windows. The terrace gives on the valley of Grévisaudan and its marvellous views, opening on vast territories: Jura mountains, those of Vercors plateau, massif of Belledonne and Chartreuse mountains. Pierre II, Pierre Terrail's son, took the title of Lord of Bayard. Consequently, the strong house took officially the name of castle. Ever since it took that name, each lord to live their made it a point that there also be a second in command. After the death of Pierre II Terrail in 1465 in the Battle of Montlhéry, his son Aymon (1420-1496) took the title of Lord of Bayard and dwelt in the castle. Like his father and his grandfather, he devoted a good part of his life to fight on behalf of the King of France, as that was what they believed was necessary to do. The castle went then to Pierre III Terrail, his son, the famous knight of Bayard. He was undoubtedly born and passed his childhood in the castle, and occupied it when he was not campaigning, and in particular when he was named Lieutenant-General of the Dauphiné and managed the province. After the death of the knight, the castle passed to his brother Georges, then to Georges' daughter, Françoise Copier. She did not have any children and sold the castle and the titles in 1559 to the d’Avançon family. Then the property passed by marriage to the Simiane de Gordes (1581), then to the Simiane de la Coste, lords of Montbives (1677), and finally to the Noinvilles (1735). Louis-Alphonse de Noinville, emigrant under the French Revolution, was the last lord of Bayard. His assets were seized and sold in 1795. The castle was in ruins for a long time (probably since Françoise Copier). The stones were even used as building material for the houses of the neighbourhoods, in spite of the protests of some scholars from the Dauphiné. In 1865, Jean-Baptiste Bertrand, a priest of Grignon, arranged the remains of the castle as a residence for his retirement by repairing part of the masonry as well as possible, with the assistance of the legal owner. Today The castle now belongs to a local notary. The Château Bayard castle had turned to ruins after the Revolution. Restored since 1890, always privately owned, since 1975 two of its rooms house a museum recounting the history of the hero. The museum is animated by the \\"Association of the Friends of Bayard\\"; since 1938, this association sticks by its regular publications and its annual meetings to restore the historical veracity. To the seigneurial home flanked with four towers was added a residence of three floors, of which only two remain and are currently occupied by the museum. The castle had suffered much damage during the French Wars of Religion and the wars for the border between Dauphiné and Savoy, then because of its abandonment during the Revolution.

Although initially named Ilahabad the name later became Allahabad in an anglicized version in Roman script. In 2018 the name of the city was changed to Prayagraj by the State government ruled by Yogi Adhityanath . The city is situated on an inland peninsula, surrounded by the rivers Ganges and Yamuna on three sides, with only one side connected to the mainland Doab region, of which it is a part. This position is of importance in Hindu scriptures for it is situated at the confluence, known as Triveni Sangam, of the holy rivers. As per Rigveda the Sarasvati River (now dried up) was part of the three river confluence in ancient times. It is one of four sites of the Kumbh Mela, an important mass Hindu pilgrimage. History  = Archaeological Findings = Excavations have revealed Iron Age of Northern Black Polished Ware in present-day Allahabad. Archaeological sites in India, such as Kosambi and Jhusi near Allahabad in present-day Uttar Pradesh show iron implements in the period 1800–1200 BC.The origins of Iron Working in India: New evidence from the Central Ganga plain and the Eastern Vindhyas by Rakesh Tewari (Director, U.P. State Archaeological Department) When this area in the North Western part of India was first settled, Prayag was part of the territory of the Kuru tribe, although most of Doab was not settled and consisted of dense forests at that time. = Ancient Times = The Doab region, including Prayaga, was controlled by several empires and dynasties in the ages to come. It became a part of the Mauryan and Gupta empires of the east and the Kushan empire of the west before becoming part of the Kannauj empire. Objects unearthed in Prayaga (now Prayagraj) indicate that it was part of the Kushana empire in the 1st century AD. According to Rajtarangini of Kalhana, in 780 CE, Prayag was also an important part of the kingdom of Karkota king of Kashmir, Jayapida.Culture and Political History of Kashmir, Volume 1 By P. N. K. Bamzai Jayapida constructed a monument at Prayag, which existed at Kalhana's time. In his memoirs on India, Huien Tsang, the Chinese Buddhist monk and chronicler who travelled through India during Harshavardhana's reign (A.D. 607–647), writes that he visited Prayaga in A.D. 643. = Muslim rule = Allahabad Fort built by Akbar in 1575 In contrast to the account of Xuanzang, the Muslim historians mention the tree to be located at the confluence of the rivers. The historian Dr. D. B. Dubey states that it appears that between this period, the sandy plain was washed away by the Ganga, to an extent that the temple and tree seen by the Chinese traveller too was washed away, with the river later changing its course to the east and the confluence shifting to the place where Akbar laid the foundations of his fort. As the majority of the houses would have been mud-walled, a flood could easily destroy them. Sir Alexander Cunningham, founder of the Archaeological Survey of India, concluded as much in his reports published in 1875 on the Archaeological Survey, supporting that assumption: \\"I infer that during the long period that intervened between the time of Hiuen Tsang and that of Akbar, the two rivers gradually carried away the whole of the sandy plain. Long before this time, the old city had, no doubt, been deserted, for we know that the fort of Allahabad was founded on its site.\\" However, present day Cambridge archaeologist Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti disagrees. He argues that there is no way modern Prayag is ancient, but that the city site of Jhusi located opposite of the confluence was the ancient settlement of Prayag. The early 19th century historian Sir Henry Miers Elliot believed that a town existed before Allahabad was founded. He adds that after Mahmud of Ghazni captured Asní near Fatehpur, he would not have crossed into Bundelkhand without visiting Allahabad, had there been a city there worth plundering. He further argues that its capture would have been heard about when Muhammad of Ghor captured Benares. However, Ghori's historians never took notice of it. Yet the Akbarnama mentions that the Mughal emperor Akbar founded a great city in Prayag. \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni and Nizamuddin Ahmad mention that Akbar laid the foundations of an Imperial City at Prayag which he called Ilahabas. Mughal rule Akbar's fort was built between 1574 and 1583. The Akbarnama states that, \\"For a long time [Akbar's] desire was to found a great city in the town of Prayag, where the rivers Ganges and Jamna join, and which is regarded by the people of India with great reverence, and which is a place of pilgrimage for ascetics of that country, and to build a choice fort there.\\" He had been impressed with its strategic position, as it sat on the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, with the fort allowing for any movement along both. Other writers also attribute it to the facilitate the collection of pilgrimage tax from those visiting Triveni, though this appears unlikely as he had already abolished it in 1563. It is said that Akbar was so impressed by its strategic site after visiting it in 1575 that he ordered that a fort be constructed and renamed it illahabas or \\"Abode of God\\" by 1584, later changed to Allahabad under Shah Jahan. Speculations regarding its name however exist. Because of the surrounding people calling it Alhabas, has led to some people holding the view that it was named after Alha from Alha's story and was renamed by Akbar in the interest of Islam. James Forbes' account of early 1800s claims that it was renamed Allahabad or \\"abode of God\\" by Jahangir after he failed to destroy the Akshayabat tree. The name, however, predates him, with Ilahabas and Ilahabad mentioned on coins minted in the city since Akbar's rule, the latter name became predominant after the emperor's death. It has also been thought to not have been named after Allah but ilaha (the gods). Shaligram Shrivastv claimed in Prayag Pradip that the name was deliberately given by Akbar to be construed as both Hindu (\\"ilaha\\") and Muslim (\\"Allah\\"). In 1580, Akbar reorganized his empire into 12 divisions, per Ain-i-Akbari, \\"to each of which he gave the name Subah and distinguished them by the appelation of the tract of country or its capital city.\\" He combined the provinces of Jaunpur, Kara-Manikpur and territory of Bandhogarh into the \\"Subah of Ilahabas\\". Akbar deputed his son Salim to carry on the war against Mewar while leaving to campaign in Deccan. The latter, however, tried to seize Agra's treasury in mid-1600 and came here after his failure. Upon reaching Allahabad, he seized its treasury and set himself up as a virtually independent ruler while raising an army. After concluding his campaign, Akbar returned to Agra in August 1601 and negotiated with Salim for eight to nine months. The latter, however, started advancing upon Agra with a 30,000-strong cavalry ostensibly under the pretext of paying respects to him. Akbar offered him the choice to return to visit him only with a small escort or return to Allahabad if he did not feel safe in doing so. Salim chose to return to city. In May 1602, Salim had his name read in Friday prayers and his name minted on coins in Allahabad. Abu'l Fazl was sent to deal with him but the prince had him assassinated. Akbar then reconciled with him and Salim returned to Allahabad, where he spent his time drinking and taking opium before returning to the royal court in 1604. A unique artefact associated with Jahangir's reign found in Allahabad is a large jade terrapin, now in the British Museum's collection.British Museum Highlights In 1720, the Sayyid brothers negotiated the surrender of the rebellious governor Girdhar Bahadur, under the condition of him being made the governor of Awadh, being able to appoint all civil and military officers in the province and being given 30 lakh rupees from Bengal's treasury. Subah of Allahabad In 1580, Akbar reorganized his empire into 12 divisions, per Ain-i-Akbari, \\"to each of which he gave the name Subah and distinguished them by the appellation of the tract of country or its capital city.\\" He combined the provinces of Jaunpur, Kara-Manikpur and territory of Bandhogarh into the \\"Subah of Ilahabas\\". He had been worried about the administration of the area, particularly after Ali Quli Khan Zaman's rebellion. Allahabad was selected as its capital. Akbar deputed his son Salim to carry on the war against Mewar while leaving to campaign in Deccan. The latter, however, tried to seize Agra's treasury in mid-1600 and came here after his failure. Upon reaching Allahabad, he seized its treasury and set himself up as a virtually independent ruler while raising an army. In May 1602, Salim had his name read in Friday prayers and his name minted on coins in Allahabad. Abu'l Fazl was sent to deal with him but the prince had him assassinated. Akbar then reconciled with him and Salim returned to Allahabad, where he spent his time drinking and taking opium before returning to the royal court in 1604. After Khusrau's death in 1622 at Burhanpur, he was buried alongside his mother Shah Begum in a garden near Khuldabad. This garden was later named Khusro Bagh after him. In March 1624, Jai Singh I and other Kachwaha nobles seem to have retired from Deccan under Parviz and Mahabat Khan. On the orders of Jahangir, they proceeded to Allahabad to check Prince Khurram's rebellion. After capturing Jaunpur, Shah Jahan ordered the siege of Allahabad. The siege was however lifted by Abdulla Khan after Parwez and Mahabat Khan came to assist the garrison. A unique artefact associated with Jahangir's reign found in Allahabad is a large jade terrapin, now in the British Museum's collection. In 1630–31, a man named Abdal near dense forests of Allahabad rebelled, constructed a fort and used to plunder passersby. The subedar Qulij Khan Turani consequently attacked him, arrested 1,000 rebels while their ladies committed jauhar. The place was renamed Islamabad and the temple constructed by the rebel was converted into a mosque. During the Mughal war of succession, the commandant of the fort of Allahabad who had joined Shah Shuja made an agreement with Aurangzeb's officers and surrendered it to Khan Dauran on 12 January 1659. In 1720, the Sayyid brothers negotiated the surrender of the rebellious governor Girdhar Bahadur, under the condition of him being made the governor of Awadh, being able to appoint all civil and military officers in the province and being given 30 lakh rupees from Bengal's treasury. Nawabs of Awadh The East India Company coveted the fort for the same reasons of military strategy for which Akbar built it. British troops were first stationed at Allahabad fort in 1765 as part of the Treaty of Allahabad signed by Lord Robert Clive, Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, and Awadh's Nawab Shuja-ud- Daula. The combined forces of Bengal's Nawab Mir Qasim, Shuja and Shah Alam were defeated by the English at Buxar in October 1764 and at Kora in May 1765. Alam who was abandoned by Shuja after the defeats, surrendered to the English and was lodged at the fort, as they captured Allahabad, Benares and Chunar in his name. The territories of Allahabad and Kora were given to the emperor after the treaty was signed in 1765. He spent six years there and after the takeover of Delhi by the Marathas, left for his capital in 1771. Upon realizing the Maratha intent of territorial encroachment, however, Shah Alam ordered his general Najaf Khan to drive them out. Tukoji Rao Holkar and Visaji Krushna Biniwale in return attacked Delhi and defeated his forces in 1772. The Marathas were granted an imperial sanad for Kora and Allahabad. They turned their attention to Oudh to gain these two territories. Shuja was, however, unwilling to give them up and made appeals to the English and the Marathas did not fare well at the battle of Ramghat. In August and September 1773, Warren Hastings met Shuja and concluded a treaty, under which Kora and Allahabad were ceded to the Nawab for a payment of 50 lakh rupees. Saadat Ali Khan II after being made the Nawab by John Shore, entered into a treaty with the Company and gave the fort to the British in 1798. Lord Wellesley after threatening to annexing the entire Awadh, concluded a treaty with Saadat on abolishing the independent Awadhi army, imposing a larger subsidiary force and annexing Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur and the Doab in 1801. =Maratha rule= Before British rule was imposed over Allahabad, the city was conquered by the Maratha Empire. The Marathas left behind two beautiful eighteenth-century temples with intricate architecture. =British rule= In 1765, the combined forces of the Nawab of Awadh and the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II lost the Battle of Buxar to the British. Although the British did not take over their states at that time, they established a garrison at Fort Allahabad, understanding its strategic position as the gateway to the northwest. Governor General Warren Hastings later took Allahabad from Shah Alam and gave it to Awadh, alleging that he had placed himself in the power of the Marathas. In 1801 the Nawab of Awadh ceded the city to the British East India Company. Gradually the other parts of Doab and adjoining regions to its west (including the Delhi and Ajmer-Merwara regions) were won by the British. These northwestern areas were made into a new province called the North-Western Provinces, with its capital at Agra. Allahabad was located in this province. Acquired in 1801, Allahabad asides from its importance as a pilgrimage center, it was a stepping stone to the agrarian track upcountry and the Grand Trunk Road. It also potentially offered sizeable revenues to the Company. Initial revenue settlements began in 1803. The qanungos assisted the British Collector Edward Cuthbert. They provided physical paper records and histories of revenue returns which helped in negotiations with the cultivators, tehsildars, zamindars and those who owned rent-free lands. In 1834, Allahabad became the seat of the Government of Agra Province and a High Court was established. A year later both were relocated to Agra. In 1857, Allahabad was active in the Indian Mutiny. After the mutiny, the British truncated the Delhi region of the state, merging it with Punjab, and transferred the capital of the North-Western Provinces to Allahabad, where it remained for the next twenty years. In 1877 the two provinces of Agra and Awadh were merged to form a new state which was called the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Allahabad was the capital of this new state till the 1920s. =Allahabad, the freedom struggle, and Indian politics= During the Mutiny of 1857, Allahabad had only a small garrison of European troops. Taking advantage of this, the rebels brought Allahabad under their control. Maulvi Liaquat Ali, one of the prominent leaders of the rebellion, was a native of the village of Mahgaon near Allahabad. Mohandas K. Gandhi attends a Congress Working Committee meeting at Anand Bhavan. Vallabhbhai Patel is to his left, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit to his right. January 1940. After the Mutiny was quelled, the British established the High Court, the Police Headquarters and the Public Service Commission in the city. This transformed Allahabad into an administrative center, a status that it enjoys to this day. The fourth and eighth session of the Indian National Congress was held in the city in 1888 and 1892 respectively on the extensive grounds of Darbhanga Castle, Allahabad.The Congress – First Twenty Years; Page 38 and 39How India Wrought for Freedom: The story of the National Congress Told from the Official records (1915) by Anne Besant. At the turn of the century, Allahabad also became a nodal point for the revolutionaries. In 1931, at Alfred Park in Allahabad, the revolutionary Chandrashekhar Azad killed himself when surrounded by the British Police. The Nehru family homes of Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan, both in Allahabad, were at the center of the political activities of the Indian National Congress. In the years of the struggle for Indian independence, thousands of satyagrahis (nonviolent resistors), led by Purshottam Das Tandon, Bishambhar Nath Pande and Narayan Dutt Tiwari, went to jail. The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as several Union ministers such as Mangla Prasad, Muzaffar Hasan, K. N. Katju, and Lal Bahadur Shastri, were natives of Allahabad. The first seeds of the idea of Pakistan were sown in Allahabad. On 29 December 1930, Allama Muhammad Iqbal's presidential address to the All-India Muslim League proposed a separate Muslim state for the Muslim majority regions of India. After independence, areas from the adjoining region of Bagelkhand in the east were merged with Allahabad district, which remain part of the district to this day. The Mayawati government split the original Allahabad district into two districts, Kaushambi and Allahabad district. From 16 October 2018 it is officially renamed as Prayagraj.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/allahabad-officially-named- as-prayagraj-allahabad-university-hc-5404894/ Historical and archaeological sites Allahabad has many sites of interest to tourists and archaeologists. Forty-eight kilometres to the southwest, on the banks of the Yamuna River, are the ruins of Kaushambi, which was the capital of the Vatsa kingdom and a thriving center of Buddhism. On the eastern side, across the river Ganges and connected to the city by the Shastri Bridge is Pratisthan Pur, capital of the Chandra dynasty. About 58 kilometres northwest is the medieval site of Kara with its impressive wreckage of Jaichand of Kannauj's fort. Shringaverpur, another ancient site discovered relatively recently, has become a major attraction for tourists and antiquarians alike. On the southwestern extremity of Allahabad lies Khusrobagh; it has three mausoleums, including that of Jahangir's first wife, Shah Begum. Allahabad is the birthplace of Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Nehru family estate, called Anand Bhavan, is now a museum. It is also the birthplace of Indira Gandhi, and the home of Lal Bahadur Shastri, both later Prime Ministers of India. Vishwanath Pratap Singh and Chandra Shekhar were also associated with Allahabad. Thus, Allahabad has the distinction of being the home of several Prime Ministers in India's post- independence history. An ancient seat of learning Prayaga was a well-known centre of education (dating from the time of the Buddha), and into modern times. Allahabad University was founded on 23 September 1887, making it the fourth oldest university in India. It has been granted Central University status. Allahabad University is a major literary centre for Hindi studies. Many Bihari, Bengali and Gujarati scholars spent their lives here, propagated their works in Hindi and enriched the literature. In the 19th century, Allahabad University earned the epithet of 'Oxford of the East'. The founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada attained sainthood in this place. Literary past Many famous writers of Hindi and Urdu literature have a connection with the city. Notable amongst them are Munshi Premchand, Mahadevi Varma, Sumitranandan Pant, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, Upendra Nath 'Ashk' and Harivansh Rai Bachchan. This is the literary Hindi heartland. The culture of Allahabad is based on Hindi literature. Maithili Sharan Gupt was also associated with this literary Hindi soil in many ways. The famous English author and Nobel Laureate (1907) Rudyard Kipling spent time at Allahabad working for The Pioneer as an assistant editor and overseas correspondent. Another landmark of the literary past of Allahabad was the publishing firm Kitabistan, owned by the Rehman brothers, Kaleemur Rehman and Obaidur Rehman. They published thousands of books, including those by Nehru. They became the first publishers from India to open a branch in London in 1936. Sanskrit scholars like Ganganath Jha, Dr. Baburam Saxena, Pandit Raghuvar Mitthulal Shastri, Professor Suresh Chandra Srivastava, and Dr. Manjushree Srivastava were both students and teachers at the University of Allahabad. The most prominent Arabic and Persian scholars included Dr. Abdul Sattar Siddiqui and his colleague Muhammad Naeemur Rehman who was known for his well organized personal library of tens of thousands of books, which was open to all. A noteworthy poet is Raghupati Sahay, better known under the name of Firaq Gorakhpuri. Firaq was a major Urdu poet and literary critic of the 20th century. Both Firaq and Harivansh Bachchan were professors of English at Allahabad University. Firaq Gorakhpuri and Mahadevi Varma were awarded the Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honour conferred in the Republic of India in 1969 and 1982 respectively. Akbar Allahabadi is one of the most well-read poets of modern Urdu Literature. Other poets from Allahabad include Nooh Narwi, Tegh Allahabadi, Raaz Allahabadi, Firaq Gorakhpuri, and Asghar Gondvi. Professor A. K. Mehrotra, former head of English department at the University of Allahabad, has been nominated for the post of professor of poetry which was earlier held by poets like Matthew Arnold and W. H. Auden. Short story writers Azam Kuraivi, Ibn-e-Safi, and Adil Rasheed are all from Allahabad. Critics like Dr. Aijaz Husain, Dr. Aqeel Rizwi and Hakeem Asrar Kuraivi also hail from Allahabad. Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, who edits Shabkhoon, is known all over the Urdu world as a pioneer in Post Modernist literature. Rajendra Yadav, Mamta and Ravindra Kalia, Kamaleshwar, Namwar Singh, Doodhnath Singh and many other new age literary writers and critics began their literary careers in Allahabad. The city is also home to many young and upcoming literary figures. It has also been one of the biggest centres of publication of Hindi literature; examples are Lok Bharti, Rajkamal and Neelabh. Dr. Rajesh Verma is working on a book about eco-feminism, which will be the first major work on environment-related issues to be published in Allahabad. Allahabad has also produced a great lyricist, Virag Mishra, who recently won the Stardust Award for Standout Performance by a lyricist, for \\"Zinda Hoon Main\\".

Cross-checking the story with the events reported by the Burmese sources indicates that the purported events at Bang Rachan are likely a merger of at least two independent events that took place in the war. The film was directed and co- written by Thanit Jitnukul. In 2004, the film was \\"presented\\" by Oliver Stone in a limited release in US cinemas. Plot The Burmese army is seeking to invade Ayutthaya, the capital of Siam. Seeking to block the invasion is a small band of villagers in Bang Rachan. The forces are at first led by Nai Taen, who is injured in an early battle. The villagers then turn to an outsider, Nai Chan Nuad Kheo, a moustachioed, veteran warrior. He brings along a handful of other men, who with the remaining men and women of Bang Rachan vow to put up a fight. They use all their resources to prepare the village for a siege, including melting down all available metal farming implements into a crudely constructed cannon. Lacking horses, the village drunkard, Nai Thongmen, mounts an old water buffalo and rides the draft animal into battle. Historical accuracy The plot follows the Thai version of events. According to Thai tradition, the Burmese northern invasion army led by Gen. Ne Myo Thihapate was held up for five months at Bang Rachan, a small village northwest of Ayutthaya by a group of simple villagers.Wyatt, p. 117 However, not all the points of this traditional Thai story could be true as the entire northern campaign took just over five months (mid-August 1765 to late January 1766), and the northern army was still stuck in Phitsanulok, in north-central Siam, as late as December 1765. Burmese sources do mention \\"petty chiefs\\" stalling the northern army's advance but it was early in the campaign along the Wang River in northern Siam (not near Ayutthaya) during the rainy season (August–October 1765). The Burmese general who was actually stationed near Ayutthaya was not Thihapate but rather Maha Nawrahta, whose southern army was waiting for the northern army to show up to attack the Siamese capital.Phayre, pp. 188-189 It appears that the three verified events—petty chiefs resisting Thihapate in the north, Thihapate's campaign period of five months, and Maha Nawrahta staking out by Ayutthaya—have merged to create this popular mythology.

It was a box-office hit in Thailand, earning more than 300 million baht. The film was screened at several film festivals in 2001, including the Seattle International Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, the Vancouver International Film Festival, and the Hawaii International Film Festival. At the Asia Pacific Film Festival, it won for best art direction. It was screen at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal in 2003, where it won second prize for Best Asian Film. The Battle of Bang Rajan was also depicted in a 1966 Thai film, starring Sombat Metanee in a role that won him a best actor honors at the \\"Golden Doll\\" Awards. The award was personally handed to Sombat by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The long-horned water buffalo featured in the film died of old age shortly after the film was released and was feted in a lavish funeral ceremony.

Secondary Instructional Support Team The primary purpose of the Secondary Instructional Support (SIS) is to provide a classroom climate and approach, where all students achieve success. Secondary Instructional Support provides a vehicle for identifying barriers to student success and for implementing instructional techniques, adaptations, learning strategies, and/or classroom management, as needed, in order to increase student achievement. Dual enrollment The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state- funded program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement. Site accessed March 2010. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system.

The District affords specialized programs of instruction specifically designed to meet the needs of the District's exceptional students. With assistance from the Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18, exceptional students have access to a complete special education program in such support areas as Learning, Life Skills, Emotional, Speech and Language, Hearing, Visual and Gifted. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Hanover Area School District received a $1,186,722 supplement for special education services in 2010. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 21 or 1.04% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The school district administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. Hanover Area School District has posted a Bullying/Cyberbullying Policy 249. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget and taxes The District Budget comprises revenue derived from local sources (taxes), state funding, and federal projects. The approximate percentages of these revenue sources are 56% local, 40% state and 4% federal. In 2008, the district reported a deficit of -$1,479,756 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as zero. In 2007, the district employed over 124 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $48,873 for 184 days worked. In 2009, the district reported employing over 160 teachers with a salary range of $35,157 to $99,400 and a median teacher salary of $56,872.

In 2009, the district reported that 1,079 students were eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to low family income.Pennsylvania Department of Education Basic Education Funding Report by School District. October 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11 the Hanover Area School District applied for and received $354,556 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide all-day kindergarten for the seventh year. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Hanover Area School District received $49,432. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Hanover Area School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, it received $106,608. The district received $45,413 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $152,021. =Federal Stimulus grant= Hanover School District received an extra $2,300,865 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used only in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over $1 million in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of a majority of school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Hanover Area School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The school board levied a real estate tax of 16.2283 mills in 2010-11. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2009-10 - 15.5892 mills In 2008, Luzerne County conducted a county wide property value reassessment. The previous county wide assessment had been done in 1965 *2008-09 - 295.0000 mills Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. The School District Adjusted Index for the Hanover Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.4%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.7%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% The Hanover Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. In the Spring of 2010, 135 of 500 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Hanover Area School District was $201 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,422 property owners applied for the tax relief. In 2010 within Luzerne County, the highest reported amount went to Wilkes-Barre Area School District set at $210 per approved homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill for each property. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010 CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient. *2010 - $203 for 4374 properties *2009 - $205 for 4334 properties Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Transportation Thirty school buses, owned and operated by Churnetski Transportation, transport elementary students who live beyond , and secondary students who live beyond . Other students may qualify for busing because they live along routes declared hazardous by the PA Department of Transportation. The district also provides bus transportation to students of the Bear Creek Community Charter School. Corruption In 2009, Anthony Spinozza, a member of the school board, plead guilty to taking bribes to award school district contracts. Spinozza had served on the Hanover Area board since 1999. Extracurricular Activities At Hanover Area School District there are two levels Junior Varsity for 7th and 8th graders and Varsity for 9th-12th grade. A student is only allowed to compete on a varsity level for four years of their academic career. Some fall sports include: Cheerleading, Boys and Girls Cross Country, Girls Tennis, Girls Field Hockey, Boys Soccer, Girls Volleyball and Boys Football. The Spring Sports provided include: Boys and Girls Swimming and Diving, Boys and Girls Track and Field, Girls Soccer, Boys Volleyball, Girls and Boys Basketball, Boys Wrestling, Girls Softball, Boys Baseball. =Academic competition= Students are encouraged to enter various local, state, and national competitions. Hanover Area students have demonstrated their accomplishments in the Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science (PJAS), the Voice of Democracy Contest, National History Day, Mock Trial, Youth Salute, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and most recently, the Marching Band captured the title of Atlantic Coast Champions for 1993, 1995 and 1996. =Clubs= There are various after-school clubs that meet during the week. * Key Club * Leo Club * Junior (7th-9th) and Senior (10th-12th) Honor Society * Drama Club * Yearbook (9th-12th) * Student Council (9th-12th) and Junior Student Council (7th-8th) * Fusion and Concert Band * Junior (7th-8th) and Senior Chorus (9th-12th) * Art Club * Mock Trial * Business Club/FBLA (9th-12th) The musically-oriented groups put on several shows a year. Two of the most popular are the Christmas Concert (generally taking place in late December) and the Spring Concert (late April/early May). Fusion, additionally, performs at all of the football games as a more \\"rock and roll\\" alternative to the traditional marching band. Due to the sedentary nature of such instruments as drums and keyboards, they do not actually march, though they do also include clarinets, saxophones, and trumpets. Drama Club puts on plays that are often popular with the student body because they are cheap and entertaining to watch. Additionally, many of the club's talented young actors and actresses take part in many of the theater-oriented senior projects.

In such experiments, the Internet is either \\"a medium through which to target larger and more diverse samples with reduced administrative and financial costs\\" or \\"a field of social science research in its own right.\\" Psychology and Internet studies are probably the disciplines that have used these experiments most widely, although a range of other disciplines including political science and economics also use web-based experiments. Within psychology most web-based experiments are conducted in the areas of cognitive psychology and social psychology.Reips, U.-D. (2007). The methodology of Internet-based experiments. In A. Joinson, K. McKenna, T. Postmes, & U.-D. Reips (Eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology (pp. 373-390). Oxford: Oxford University Press.Reips, U.-D. & Krantz, J. H. (2010). Conducting true experiments on the Web. In S. Gosling & J. Johnson, Advanced Internet Methods in the Behavioral Sciences (pp. 193-216). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. This form of experimental setup has become increasingly popular because researchers can cheaply collect large amounts of data from a wider range of locations and people. A web-based experiment is a type of online research method. Web based experiments have become significantly more widespread since the COVID-19 pandemic, as researchers have been unable to conduct lab-based experiments.  Introduction  Experiments are an integral part of research, however, their integration with the Internet has been gradual. There are three main categories of experiments: * Controlled experiments, done in a laboratory setting, attempt to control for all variables then test for a single effect. * Natural experiments, conducted after a large-scale event which was prohibitively difficult or impossible to control, collect as many variables as possible then draw correlations. * Field experiments, observed in a natural setting where less controls can be applied, have the advantage of better external validity. The adaption of each type of experiment online faces some hurdles.  Benefits  Web-based experiments are significantly less expensive, potentially allowing the researcher to: * Reach more diverse samples, as well as rare or specific sub-populations * Run experiments more quickly * Recruit larger subject pools that provide higher statistical power * Conduct cross-cultural social experiments in real time These benefits have the potential to translate into greater external validity and generalizability for the study. For instance, in web-based experiments there is less reliance on data gathered from populations of Western undergraduate students who are often used as the default research subjects in social science disciplines. Because participants remain in their homes or offices while participating in the experiment, scholars have also argued that such experiments have greater ecological validity.  Criticisms and limitations  Web-based experiments may have weaker experimental controls compared to laboratory-based experiments, and may face greater difficulties coming up with procedures that ensure reliability and internal validity.Hoffman, M., & Morgan, J. (2011). Who’s Naughty? Who’s Nice? Social Preferences in Online Industries. UC Berkeley Working Paper. Online natural and field experiments may also face challenges generalizing findings beyond the online context in which they were conducted. Some potential difficulties faced by web-based experiments include: * Difficulty verifying the identity of subjects participating in the experiment * Experimental instructions ignored or read too carelessly, leading to lower quality data * Shorter decision times of online participants triggering instinctive and emotional reasoning processes rather than cognitive and rational ones, which could cause subjects to make more pro-social decisions on average * Significant distractions occurring during the course of the experiment unbeknownst to the researchers * Subjects selectively dropping out of the experiment, especially if drop-out is correlated with the independent variable(s) * Variance in the data due to network connection speed and reliability, browser and computer types, screen size and resolution, etc. * Subjects taking the experiment less seriously and behaving with less risk-aversion * Subjects not believing that they are interacting with real human partners * Subject concerns about compensation at the end of the experiment or anonymity of payment processing * The non- representative nature of the mostly English-speaking computer users who participate In the face of these criticisms, some researchers have argued that brick-and-mortar experiments are just as affected by these problems, if not more so.Reips, U.-D. (1996, October). Experimenting on the World WideWeb. Paper presented at the 1996 Society for Computers in Psychology conference, Chicago.http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr00/research.html Studies have been conducted to test the internal validity of web-based experiments, comparing across experimental conditions (online and offline) and successfully replicating findings. For example, Schoeffler et al. (2013) compared laboratory- and web-based results (62 and 1,168 subjects) of an auditory experiment and found no significant differences.Schoeffler et al. (2013). \\"An Experiment About Estimating the Number of Instruments in Polyphonic Music: A Comparison Between Internet and Laboratory Results\\" A paired experiment in behavioral economics split into online and traditional lab environments produced substantively similar results. Uncompensated and unsupervised subjects on LabintheWild have been shown to replicate previous in-lab study results with comparable data quality.  Methodologies  Experimental protocols have been suggested to prevent or control difficulties associated with web-based experimentation. Methods like sequential subject matching, background timing and mouse use tracking, and instantaneous compensation through PayPal have the potential to address many of the concerns about the internal validity of web-based experiments. These methods control for differences in response times, address issues of selective attrition, concentration, and distraction, minimize subject concern about compensation, improve subject confidence that they have a real human partner in the experiment, and ensure that subjects have an appropriate understanding of the instructions and the decision problems in the experiment. Scholars have also formulated techniques to decrease or account for drop-outs, including the high-hurdle technique (motivationally adverse information is clustered at the beginning of the study), the seriousness check (requesting participant's probability estimate that they'll complete the study), and the warm-up phase (placing consent forms or other pre-study materials first to winnow the samples before the study begins).  Examples  = Use in psychology = A wide range of psychology experiments are conducted on the web. The Web Experiment List provides a way to recruit participants and archives past experiments (over 700 and growing).http://wexlist.net A good resource for designing a web experiment is the free Wextor tool, which \\"dynamically creates the customized Web pages needed for the experimental procedure\\" and is remarkably easy to use. Web experiments have been used to validate results from laboratory research and field research and to conduct new experiments that are only feasible if done online. Further, the materials created for web experiments can be used in a traditional laboratory setting if later desired. Interdisciplinary research using web experiments is rising. For example, a number of psychology and law researchers have used the web to collect data. Lora Levett and Margaret Bull Kovera examined whether opposing expert witnesses are effective in educating jurors about unreliable expert evidence. Rather than sensitizing jurors to flaws in the other expert's testimony, the researchers found that jurors became more skeptical of all expert testimony. In her experiment, this led to more guilty verdicts. Levett and Kovera's research used a written transcript of a trial, which participants then read before making their decision. This type of stimulus has been criticized by some researchers as lacking ecological validity—that is, it does not closely approximate a real-life trial. Many recommend the use of video where possible. Researchers at New York University are currently conducting a psychology and law study that uses video of a criminal trial.Virginia vs. McNamara Researchers at University of Salford are currently conducting a number of studies online to explore sound perception. Sound experiments over the web are particularly difficult due to lack of control over sound reproduction equipment. Salganik, Dodds, and Watts conducted an experiment to measure social influence, specifically in the popularity rating of songs. Their use of the Internet allowed them to collect over 14,000 participants and examine the relationship between individual and collective behavior. = Use in economics = As more experiments have been conducted in economics, questions about appropriate methodology and study organization has been raised. Jerome Hergueux and Nicolas Jacquemet developed an \\"online laboratory\\" to compare social preferences and risk aversion online and in person. They administered a risk aversion assessment, Public good game, a Trust game, a Dictator game, and an Ultimatum game to groups both online and in a lab as a way of assessing the internal validity of web-based experimentation in economics. = Use in political science = An online field experiment conducted on 61 million Facebook users tested whether receiving information about voting, polling places, and the voting behavior of one's friends led individuals to seek out political information, influenced political self-expression, and changed real- world voting behavior. = Use in internet studies = Web-based experiments have particular salience in studies of how online communities operate. Internet studies, including studies of online communities and social networks, have used natural and field experiments to understand the effects of informal rewards in peer production on Wikipedia, as well as the impact of early recognition and support on future successes on Kickstarter, Change.org, Epinions, and Wikipedia. Another experiment looked at the effect on edit rates of introducing a program of intelligent task assignment on Wikipedia.

Its name translates into English as Asaph's Hollow.  History  St Clares CourtOnce abbey land belonging to nearby Basingwerk Abbey, Pantasaph came into the possession of the Pennant family at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The land passed down in the family until 1846, when the sole heiress Louisa married Rudolph, Viscount Feilding, heir to the 7th Earl of Denbigh. They both converted to Roman Catholicism and decided to donate St David's Church, which they had recently built for the village, to the Roman Catholic Church. This caused a considerably outcry at the time. It was accepted by the Friars Minor Capuchin of Great Britain as their mother house and opened in 1852. The church was designed by T H Wyatt and modified, to make it more specifically suited to Catholic use, by Augustus Pugin, who designed the high altar, the pulpit, the baptismal font, the reredos in the Lady Chapel and a statue of the Madonna and Child. The altar, reredos and statue had been exhibited in the 'Mediaeval Court' at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The pulpit was removed and destroyed during a post-Vatican II re-ordering in the 1960s. The graveyard holds the remains of three British soldiers shot for cowardice during World War I. The village is also the location of the former St Clare's Convent which included a boarding school, a hospital and an orphanage. It was built by a Father Seraphin of Bruges, who brought the first group of sisters to it in 1861. It closed in 1977, having at its peak housed some 500 orphans. The site lay derelict for a number of years and was damaged by fire in 1985, but has since been partly demolished and the remainder restored as luxury accommodation. It is now a designated conservation area. The poet Francis Thompson spent some time recovering from illness at Pantasaph in the 1890s, lodging in a house beside the friary gates, at the post office and at Crecas Cottage between Pantasaph and Carmel.  Friary  St David's Friary Church The first friars occupied the original presbytery, (now called Denbigh House), designed by Wyatt as the vicarage to what was to be an Anglican church. Following the consecration of St David's church, the friary was constructed in Collegiate Gothic style between 1858 and 1865. A wing was added to the east in 1899 to form an L-shaped range with a turret in the angle. Built in two storeys with attics and basements it is constructed of snecked grey stone with sandstone dressings and steep slate roofs. Divine Mercy Picture, Pantasaph Friary. St David's church and the friary complex have all been awarded grade II* listed status. The friary is now a large Franciscan Retreat Centre, and the friars have returned to live in Denbigh House, their original home at Pantasaph.

The film, starring Chaim Topol (best known for his role as Tevye from Fiddler on the Roof) is a comical tale of a con man who falls in love with a police officer. Plot Ervinka is a young man living in Tel Aviv of the 1960s. He does not believe in work, morality, law and order, and settling down. He ekes out a living as a petty con man by charging parking fees to a lot that doesn’t belong to him, stealing electricity from his neighbors, eating for free in family events he is not invited to, and extorting money from movie directors by revving up his moped engine near their film sets. He also finds ways to con the authorities, taking advantage of the stupidity, laziness, and inefficiency of bureaucrats (a favorite subject of Kishon's work). Ervinka even ingratiates himself with the local underworld by getting them out of trouble with the law over a robbery. His only dream is to win the lottery so he would not have to get by on his wits anymore. Ervinka’s carefree life becomes complicated when he falls in love with Ruti, a police officer. While she loves him, she is equally appalled by his way of life and is concerned that he is on a slippery slope to a life of crime. Tired of never winning the lottery, Ervinka devises a devilish con to rob the lottery offices in Tel Aviv. Under the guise of making a movie, he has his underworld friends try to crack the lottery safe open while all around him are spectators and even police officers, all under the impression that they are watching a film director at work. When the underworld has problems getting the safe to open, the police volunteers its own expert to help them so that filming could proceed as planned. Thanking them for their help, Ervinka and his friends leave with the money seconds before the authorities realize what is actually going on. With next week’s jackpot safely tucked in a bag behind his moped seat, Ervinka believes he has realized his dream. However, his police officer object of affection tracks him down, while he's making his escape. She confesses her feelings for him to be just as strong as his are for her, but makes it clear she will not associate with a criminal. Choosing her over the money, Ervinka returns the money to the General Manager of the lottery in an official ceremony just like the one he had always imagined himself receiving this money in.

The histamine H3 receptor is an inhibitory autoreceptor located on histaminergic nerve terminals, and is believed to be involved in modulating the release of histamine in the brain. Histamine has an excitatory effect in the brain via H1 receptors in the cerebral cortex, and so drugs such as ciproxifan which block the H3 receptor and consequently allow more histamine to be released have an alertness-promoting effect. Ciproxifan produces wakefulness and attentiveness in animal studies, and produced cognitive enhancing effects without prominent stimulant effects at relatively low levels of receptor occupancy, and pronounced wakefulness at higher doses. It has therefore been proposed as a potential treatment for sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and to improve vigilance in old age, particularly in the treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. It also potentiated the effects of antipsychotic drugs, and has been suggested as an adjuvant treatment for schizophrenia.

Early life Born in Edinburgh as William Strachan, and educated at the Royal High School, Strahan was the son of George Strachan, an Edinburgh solicitor and grandson of John Strachan, professor of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh. originally apprenticed to an Edinburgh printer but became a Master Printer in London (at which time he changed the spelling of his name). In 1738 he was made a Freeman of the City of London and a freeman of the Stationers' Company. He married Margaret Penelope Elphinstone, daughter of Edinburgh Episcopal Clergyman William Elphnstone, at St Mary Le Bow on 20 July 1738.http://www.patrickspeople.co.uk/files/9142.htmhttp://www.patrickspeople.co.uk/files/9136.htm They had five children, two daughters and three sons, one of whom, Andrew, would succeed him as King's Printer. Printing to Publishing Diversifying from printing to publishing, Strahan built up a highly important and successful business, at one time employing 50 men. He was Samuel Johnson's chief publisher, being entrusted with the printing of Johnson's Dictionary, and also published the works of the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith, and the historian Edward Gibbon. Prominent 18th Century Freemason William Preston had attended the same school as Strahan in Edinburgh and was employed by Strahan, as an editor, particularly of David Hume's works. From 1770, Strahan was Printer to the King. Strahan was also the printer for the successful London bookseller Andrew Millar, as well as his longtime friend and business partner. Between 1740–65 Strahan moved his London premises four times in the area between St Bride's and the Strand. By 1770 he owned the biggest printing operation in the kingdom, comprising three separate printing businesses in six buildings. Friendship with Benjamin Franklin For many years, Strahan attended debates in Parliament and wrote reports of the proceedings that were widely circulated; his paragraphs of political news were frequently printed in the Pennsylvania Gazette, and he became a friend of its owner, Benjamin Franklin. His protégé, David Hall, succeeded Franklin at his print shop in Philadelphia when Franklin retired in 1747. At first he sympathised with the grievances of the American colonists, disapproving of the Stamp Act and publishing arguments in favour of a reconciliation in his London Chronicle. However, he later developed a much more hostile attitude, writing to Hume in 1775 \\"I am entirely for coercive methods with these obstinate madmen.\\" This hostility also led to Benjamin Franklin ending their friendship but reconciling after the war. Parliamentary career In 1774, Strahan purchased a seat as MP for the Wiltshire borough of Malmesbury, sitting as a supporter of Lord North's Tory administration. He represented that constituency until 1780, and then Wootton Bassett from 1780 to 1784, when he stood down because of ill health. He died the following year.

Contributing writers for the film were Agustín Rolandelli and Nicolás Smudt. It was produced by Oscar Kramer and Hugo Sigman. The film is considered an Argentine entry in the buddy-cop adventure subgenre. Synopsis Alfredo Díaz (Luis Luque) is a cop who falls into a depression after discovering that his wife has been cheating on him. Mariano Silverstein (Diego Peretti), a psychologist assigned by the force, tries to help Alfredo deal with his problem. When Alfredo is invited to dinner to Silverstein's home, he unmasks Silverstein's wife, who also has an affair, which causes the psychologist and the cop to switch roles. Díaz takes Silverstein with him on many adventures as both begin to unravel a criminal conspiracy of national proportions.

It was shown at film festivals, including: the Málaga Film Festival, Spain; the Indie - World Film Festival, Brazil; the Villeurbanne Festival Reflets du cinéma ibérique et Latino-américain, France; and others. Critical reception Variety magazine film critic Jonathan Holland, liked the film although he had a few problems with the latter part of the film. He wrote, \\"A well-scripted and played Argentine buddy movie that generates fine comedy and decent thrills from an engagingly offbeat premise, On Probation is a surprising pleasure. Though things fall apart somewhat in the final reels, the solid work early on sees pic through successfully. Probation did good business at home following its September 2005 release, followed by unexpectedly healthy Spanish B.O. in 2006, suggesting pic could walk free in selected offshore markets beyond the Hispanic, with a cult following via fest play likely.\\"Holland, Jonathan.

In 1918, she published her first novel En una silla de ruedas (In a Wheelchair), which portrays national customs and manners through the eyes of a paralyzed boy who grows up to become an artist, with a strong dose of sentimentalism and intimations of the bohemian life of San Jose. In 1919, during a teacher's protest against the dictatorship of Federico Tinoco Granados, Lyra galvanized the crowd and in their anger, they burned the government news office. She managed to escape the police manhunt disguised as a news seller. In 1920, she published her most well-known work Los Cuentos de Mi Tia Panchita (Tales of My Aunt Panchita), a collection of folk tales. When the dictatorship crumbled, she was given a scholarship to study abroad, at the Sorbonne, in Apex and also visited schools in Italy and England to evaluate pedagogical methods in use in Europe. She returned in 1921 to manage the Department of Children's Literature at the Normal School of Costa Rica. In 1926, Lyra founded and directed the first Montessori pre-kindergarten, teaching the poorest students of San José. Lyra's home became a gathering place for intellectuals and writers and her politics increasingly moved to the left. In 1931, she and Manuel Mora Valverde founded the Costa Rican Communist Party.\\"Jiménez (2009)\\", p 8 She was joined by fellow teachers María Alfaro de Mata, Odilia Castro Hidalgo, Adela Ferreto, Angela García, Luisa González, Stella Peralta, Emilia Prieto, Lilia Ramos, Esther Silva and Hortensia Zelaya, who had been radicalized at the Normal School (teacher's college), to challenge a society built on privilege and the roles of women being confined to home, marriage, and motherhood. That same year, Lyra and Luisa González formed the Unique Union of Women Workers and suggested the creation of a union for Costa Rican Teachers, which would not be created until 1939 by Odilia Castro. In 1931, she published Bananos y Hombres (Bananas and Men) anticipating the actual 1934 banana workers' strike, organized by the communist party and in which she played a significant part.\\"Jiménez (2009)\\", p 25 As her politics and activities became more radical, Lyra was removed from her teaching posts and in 1948, at the conclusion of the Costa Rican Civil War, when José Figueres Ferrer outlawed the communist party she was sent into exile in Mexico. Despite repeated pleas to be allowed to return home due to illness, Lyra was denied and died in Mexico City on 14 May 1949.\\"Jiménez (2009)\\", p 9 In 1962 the Board of Education of Cóbano, named a school in her honor and the Costa Rica Legislative Assembly awarded her the honor of Benemérita de la Cultura Nacional in 1976. Lyra was inducted into La Galería de las Mujeres de Costa Rica (The Costa Rican Gallery of Women) in 2005. As of 2010 Carmen Lyra is depicted on the twenty thousand colon bill.

Early life  The daughter of Derrick Warner William Westenra, 5th Baron Rossmore, of Rossmore Castle, County Monaghan and his wife, Mittie (née Naylor),thePeerage.com Lady Mary Bailey spent most of her childhood in Ireland where she was home schooled until she ran away in 1906. Adventurous from a young age, she apparently bought a motorbike in her youth and was gaining a reputation for speeding in cars by 1914.  Aviation  During the First World War, Mary volunteered as an aviation mechanic and served in Britain and France, associated with the Royal Flying Corps. She was awarded a pilot's licence in early 1927The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom - official notices to members in Flight, 17 February 1927, pg. 84 and quickly started a sporting career.

She then made the journey back between September 1928 and 16 January 1929. The return journey involved flying across the Congo, then along the southern edge of the Sahara and up the west coast of Africa, then across Spain and France back home again. It was the longest solo flight and longest flight accomplished by a woman that far.Editorial Comment , Flight, 10 January 1929 This feat won her the 1929 Britannia Trophy. In 1927 and 1928 she twice won the Harmon Trophy as the world's outstanding aviatrix. She also participated in the Challenge International de Tourisme 1929, which she completed off the contest, and Challenge International de Tourisme 1930, in which she took 31st place for 60 participants, being one of only two women. Krzyżan, Marian. Międzynarodowe turnieje lotnicze 1929-1934, Warsaw 1988, In 1930 she held a seat on the Women's Engineering Society Council. In 1931, she became a member of a group of female pioneers for science, the members of which shared her adventurous and determined spirit. That same year Bailey became the first woman in the United Kingdom to obtain a Certificate for Blind Flying. Bailey also attained the rank of Section Officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, during World War II.  Contributions to Archaeology  Lady Mary Bailey was also able to use her talents for aviation to take aerial photographs of important archaeological sites. She was very likely the first woman to accomplish this during her work in February 1931 on the Kharga Oasis project in Egypt. Working closely with Gertrude Caton-Thompson and Elinor Wight Gardner, Bailey was able to take aerial photographs which presented an expansive overview of the archaeological site within just two weeks. These photographs accomplished what would have taken far longer to do on foot. In addition, there also revealed future excavation sites. Indeed, Lady Mary Bailey's valuable contribution to the Kharga Oasis expedition was both innovative and impressive.

It was also published as part of Walk About, which included Down Under and another of Bryson's books, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, in one volume. Summary Bill Bryson describes his travels by railway and car throughout Australia, his conversations with people in all walks of life about the history, geography, unusual plants and animals of the country, and his wry impressions of the life, culture and amenities (or lack thereof) in each locality. In a style similar to his book A Walk in the Woods, or William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways, Bryson's research enabled him to include many stories about Australia's 19th-century explorers and settlers who suffered extreme deprivations, as well as details about its natural resources, culture, and economy. His writings are intertwined with recurring humorous themes. Synopsis The book consists of three parts. 1\\\\. Into the Outback The first part of the book mainly describes the journey taken by Bryson aboard the Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth. He is accompanied on this journey by a young English photographer named Trevor Ray Hart. The author describes his experiences on the train, the places the train passes through on its way to Perth such as the Blue Mountains and White Cliffs. The author also supplies plenty of humor in the form of historical accounts of early explorers and settlers of Australia.

Opened in 1971 until closing in 1983, it was overseen by the Etobicoke Board of Education, which was joined with other school boards in the Toronto area during the city's amalgamation to form what is now the Toronto District School Board. History KMCI, Etobicoke’s twentieth and final conventional high school, was constructed in 1970 and opened its doors in September 1971. This school, like most schools in Etobicoke, was design by Gordon Adamson and Associates Architects. Its architecture reminds one of a factory - specifically, there is a distinct lack of windows. The school experienced declining enrollment during the late 1970s and early 1980s as with other schools in Etobicoke area plummeted following a decision by the Ontario Government to extend funding of Catholic schools to include secondary school grades 10 to 13 (OAC) in the 1980s. The Etobicoke Board of Education made a final decision to close KMCI in 1981-82 as the school property was sold to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (later the Toronto Catholic District School Board, and now houses Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School), and KMCI closed its doors for the last time at the end of the 1982-83 school year. There was a need for a Catholic school. Don Bosco had already been running in the area in portables since its inception in 1978 and needed a school building. Keiller MacKay was chosen to be sold to the separate school board due to its declining enrolment.\\\\- Keiller MacKay reunites after 24 years (Etobicoke Guardian) The school was named after John Keiller MacKay, who served as the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1957 to 1963. The school colours were green and blue, and its mascot was a Saber-toothed cat. The school's motto was Manu Forti (Strong Hand). Don Bosco also met its similar fate thirty-four years later, by closing its doors at the end of the 2016-17 school year. As of August 2017, the building is home to the Toronto Argonauts practice facility. The Keiller Mackay Room is currently located in the TDSB's West Education Office, the former headquarters of the EBE. Principals KMCI had only 2 Principals through the 12 years it was open.

Since Lukather had a number of songs written that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album. His intention was to present a dimension of his musical work that fans would not be familiar with, and he collaborated with many notable musicians.http://www.stevelukather.com/music/discography/1989/lukather.aspx Among the people involved in Lukather were Eddie Van Halen, Steve Stevens, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich.

He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album.

Biography Gene Markey and Joan Bennett, 1933 Hedy Lamarr and Gene Markey, 1939 =Early life= Markey was born in Michigan in the year 1895. His father, Eugene Lawrence Markey, was a colonel in the United States Army. His uncle, Daniel P. Markey, had been Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1918. =Chicago= He was a skilled sketch artist, which gained him entry, after World War I, into the Art Institute of Chicago starting in 1919 and finishing in 1920. There, he claimed to have \\"studied painting and learned nothing\\". After that, he worked as a journalist in Chicago for several newspapers and magazines, including Photoplay magazine. It was during the 1920s that Gene Markey became a writer, specializing in novels about the Jazz Age. Among his titles were Anabel; Stepping High; Women, Women, Everywhere; and His Majesty's Pyjamas. His book \\"Literary Lights\\" (March 1923, Alfred A. Knopf, New York) was a collection of fifty caricatures of America's most important literary authors of the day. =Hollywood= He went to Hollywood in 1929 and became a screenwriter for Twentieth Century Fox. His screen credits included King of Burlesque (1936) starring Alice Faye, Girls' Dormitory (1936) featuring Herbert Marshall, and On the Avenue (1937), starring Dick Powell, Madeleine Carroll, and Alice Faye. He was also the producer of the 1937 Shirley Temple film, Wee Willie Winkie, among others. Although he was not overly handsome, he was a very skilled conversationalist and he quickly became a popular fixture in Hollywood society. Among his good friends in Hollywood were producer John Hay Whitney, composer Irving Berlin, and actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Ward Bond and John Wayne. He would often go fishing with Bond and Wayne off Catalina Island. A 1946 article in the Washington Times Herald said, \\"Other Men Say: What's Gene Markey Got That We Haven't Got?\\" The article ran a photo of Rudolph Valentino with the caption, \\"NOT SO HOT – By Comparison. Though all American womanhood swooned over him in his day, Rudolph Valentino was no Markey.\\" Soon after he arrived in Hollywood in 1929, it was also reported that, \\"Markey became the most sought after unattached man in the cinema firmament, so sprinkled with far handsomer, richer male stars.\\" Markey was married three times to prominent film actresses. His first marriage, to Joan Bennett, from 1932 to 1937, produced a daughter, Melinda, in 1934. He was married to Hedy Lamarr from 1939 to 1940 and to Myrna Loy from 1946 to 1950. At first, Loy claimed mental cruelty, but later retracted it, saying, \\"He could make a scrubwoman think she was a queen and he could make a queen think she was the queen of queens.\\"Wild Ride, Anne Hagedorn Auerbach, New York, Henry Holt and Company, LLC, 1994, p. 64 =Military career= After his graduation from Dartmouth, Markey became a lieutenant in the infantry during World War I (which the United States had entered in 1917) and saw action at the Battle of Belleau Wood. He then joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1920, and it was during World War II that he made his greatest mark. In August 1941, he reported to Balboa, Panama, with the rank of lieutenant commander. He had a yacht, Melinda (named after his daughter), that he donated to the United States Navy for use as a submarine chaser. During the war, Markey rose to the rank of commodore and served as an assistant intelligence officer on the staff of Fleet Admiral William \\"Bull\\" Halsey at Guadalcanal. After the war, he was promoted to rear admiral and he officially retired from the Navy on February 27, 1956. He was highly decorated; among his awards were the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with Combat V (for leading a reconnaissance mission in the Solomon Islands in 1942), a Navy Commendation Medal, Italy's Star of Solidarity, and France's Legion of Honor. During World War II, Markey became good friends with Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. After the war, he became a special assistant to United States Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. Markey was very proud of his admiral's commission. He insisted on being called \\"Admiral Markey\\", never \\"Mister Markey\\" and, rarely, \\"Gene\\". For the rest of his life, he would promptly toss any mail (including bills) that wasn't addressed to Admiral Markey into the trash. =Later life= He returned to Hollywood after the war and, on September 27, 1952, he married his fourth wife, Lucille Parker Wright, the widow of Warren Wright, owner of the Calumet Farm racing stable. Markey left California after this marriage. He developed something of a knack for naming the farm's horses. First there was a filly, was named Our Mims after his daughter Melinda. Another was named Myrtle Morgan after the two streets that intersected in front of his property in Saratoga Springs, New York. Still another was named Eastern Fleet (possibly as a tribute to his service in the Navy) who would finish fourth in the 1971 Kentucky Derby and second in the Preakness Stakes. Markey was also a lover of dogs. He owned a black Labrador Retriever named Lucky that lived to be 17, which is very unusual. Mrs. Markey also had a dog, a Yorkshire Terrier that was named Timmy Tammy (after which she was thought to have named one of Calumet Farm's champion thoroughbreds, Tim Tam). Mrs. Markey carried the dog with her in her purse everywhere she went. Shortly after this marriage, Markey would become good friends with Ralph Wilson who later was the founder and owner of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. One of Mrs. Markey's hobbies was collecting statues of eagles. In 18th century Kentucky, eagles were widely believed to be a symbol of good luck. Dividing his time between Lexington, Kentucky, Saratoga Springs, New York, and Miami Beach, Florida (with an occasional trip to Europe thrown in), he continued to write. Among his works during this period were: Kentucky Pride, an adventure–romance set in Civil War Kentucky, and That Far Paradise, a story of an 18th-century family making its way from Virginia to settle in what later became Kentucky. As background research for his book, Markey recreated the journey himself. Markey was very fond of the time he spent in Kentucky, quickly becoming a fixture on its social scene and becoming good friends with many members of the thoroughbred racing community. He once told a reporter, \\"I cannot restrain my ardor for the place and its people...No duck ever took to water as I have taken to Kentucky.\\" Markey was also a noted party giver. One of his specialties was a tropical punch made with an unknown number of rums. At his parties, his old friends from Hollywood often mixed with his new friends from Kentucky and mixed very well. While he lived in Kentucky, he purchased an old 18th-century log cabin and had it moved to the Calumet Farm property, where he would use it as his writing room. He also had two brands of private reserve bourbon distilled he named \\"Old Commodore\\" (as a tribute to his service in the U.S. Navy) and \\"Old Calumet Cabin\\" (after his writing room). On July 31, 1958, Admiral Markey was commissioned a Kentucky Colonel (a ceremonial rank) by Governor Albert Benjamin \\"Happy\\" Chandler Sr. He also served as the model for the character played by Burgess Meredith in the 1965 film In Harm's Way, starring his good friend John Wayne. Admiral and Mrs. Markey remained married until his death after which in 1980, he was buried in the Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky. His wife, Lucille Parker Wright, was buried next to him upon her death shortly thereafter in 1982.

Early years Having been given the governorship of Balkh, Abdal-Latif Mirza served under his father. During the succession struggle that followed the death of Shah Rukh, he occupied Herat, although after Ulugh Beg left the city at the end of 1448 it was conquered by Abul- Qasim Babur Mirza. Abdal-Latif Mirza did not remain loyal to his father. Angry over the fact that he was to be passed over in the transfer of rule of Samarkand, he revolted while Ulugh Beg was marching to retake Khorasan. He defeated his father at Dimashq, near Samarkand, in the fall of 1449. Ulugh Beg later decided to surrender himself, and Abdal-Latif Mirza granted him permission to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, but while Ulugh Beg was on his way he was murdered by his son on the latter's order.

Stretching north from the square Riddarhustorget to the bridge Vasabron, it passes between the Swedish House of Knights (Riddarhuset) and the Bonde Palace forming a parallel street to Rådhusgränd. On either side of its northern end are the quays Riddarhuskajen and Kanslikajen. History Riddarhusgränd viewed from Vasabron in February 2007. While the House of Knights was built to the design of Simon de la Vallée in 1641–1674, and the Bonde Palace was originally designed as a private palace by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and Jean De la Vallée in 1662–1667, the alley passing between them and named after the vicinity to the former, first appears in historical records in 1718 as Riddarhuus Gränden. It was initially intended as the northern extension of Stora Nygatan, a street stretching north through the old town to Riddarhustorget, and in turn the result of the reconstruction of the western part of the old town following the great fire of 1625. Before the bridge Vasabron was constructed in the 1870s, the alley was a peripheral passage leading to a remote quay and, as its width of 7 metres still knows to tell, it was not designed to take up heavy traffic loads. With the completion of the bridge things changed considerably, and, as intimated by the bridge, the intention in the 19th century was to widen the alley at the expense of the Bonde Palace to give space to a second roadway. As these plans were never carried out, traffic is still forced to make a detour around the intact palace. The eastern façade of the House of Knights is one of the most elaborate of its kind in Sweden, richly decorated with acorns, oak leaves, and a great variety of flowers in sandstone, while the half metre tall letters on the frieze of the roof, ornamented in gold leaf proclaim DULCE ET DECORUM EST PRO PATRIA MORI (\\"Delightful and honourable it is to die for the Patrimony/Country\\"). The façade and all the details were carefully restored by specialists in 2004. Lately, selected buildings and historical structures in central Stockholm have been the subject for a project entitled Projekt Nattljus (\\"Project Night Light\\"), intended to give the city a face-lift by letting spotlights illuminate façades, bridges, fountains, etc. Riddarhusgränd is included in the project as part of the lighting design for Riddarhustorget.

The species is native to the Chihuahuan Desert and parts of northern Mexico and the southern United States, where they grow at elevations up to . This cactus earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. E. reichenbachii is one of the smaller Echinocereus species. They reach tall and wide. Plants are solitary or clustered in as many as 12, with erect stems that have 10 to 19 ribs. The stems are dark green and often obscured by the spines, which range from tan, brown, black, or pink, and the tips are usually darker than the shaft. The areoles are elliptical or oval, with seven to 36 spines each. The purple or pink flowers bloom in early May to late June, growing to approximately by . E. reichenbachii are cold and heat tolerant, and prefer dry, well-drained soils near rock outcroppings. Taxonomy The scientific name, Echinocereus, comes from the Greek ', meaning hedgehog, and ', the Latin term for wax paper. The specific epithet honors the German botanist Ludwig Reichenbach. Common names include Lace hedgehog cactus, Lace cactus, Lace hedgehog, Purple candle, and Órgano-pequeño de colores. In 1843, German botanist Carl Adolf Terscheck named a specimen of cactus collected in Mexico Echinocactus reichenbachii, but his description was incomplete and proved unhelpful to later scholars. During the years 1848 to 1856, George Engelmann made extensive studies of a plant he named Echinocereus caespitosus. Prior to this Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt- Dyck referred to plants in European collections as Echinopsis pectinate var. reichenbachiana, and he later discussed the possibility with Engelmann that these two plants were one and the same. Despite the early indication of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was used to describe the plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's. Variations and subspecies Variations of Echinocereus reichenbachii include E. reichenbachii var. albertii, E. reichenbachii var. fitchii, E. reichenbachii var. albispinus, E. reichenbachii subsp. armatus, E. reichenbachii subsp. burrensis, and E. reichenbachii subsp. fitchii. Direct children include E. reichenbachii var. baileyi, E. reichenbachii var. perbellus, and E. reichenbachii var. reichenbachii. E. reichenbachii var. albertii (commonly called the Black Lace cactus) is a federally listed endangered species of the United States that is endemic to Texas. It has been listed as endangered since 1979. Populations of E. reichenbachii var. albertii are found near the Kleberg, Jim Wells, and Refugio counties of south Texas. Destruction of habitat, over-collecting, and livestock grazing have all contributed to its endangered status. Description E. reichenbachii Echinocereus reichenbachii is a perennial plant and shrub. It is one of the smaller Echinocereus species. Immature specimens are spherical, and as they grow they become cylindrical. Plants are solitary or multi-branched in clusters of as many as twelve, with erect stems with 10 to 19 slightly undulate ribs. They reach tall and wide. The stems are dark green and obscured by the spines, especially when the plant is dehydrated. Areoles are elliptical or oval. They are spaced apart, with 15 to 36 spines each. The spines are tan, to brown, black, purplish black, or pink, and the tips are usually darker than the shaft. The central spines tend to be the darkest. There are up to 7 central spines per areole; they are long. Plants flower in early May and late June, and they fruit 6 to 10 weeks after flowering. Flowers open for just one day, but anthesis is usually staggered so plants have blooming flowers for a full week; buds are covered in white wool that hides the fruit as it develops. The flower's inner tepals are silvery pink or magenta; the outer portions are white, crimson, green, or multicolored. They are approximately by , and the flower tubes are by . The tube hairs are long, and the nectar chamber is deep. Flowers have 30 to 50 petals each, which are ragged or notched. Pistils are multi-lobed and green, and stamens are cream-colored or yellow. Fruits are various shades of green and long. Native habitat E. reichenbachii native habitat includes the entirety of the Chihuahuan Desert and its nearby grasslands, as well as in woodlands of oak and juniper. They grown at elevations up to . In the United States, E. reichenbachii is native to Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Nebraska. They are also found in Kansas and Oklahoma. The variety found in Oklahoma, E. reichenbachii baileyi, have especially long \\"bristlelike\\" spines. E. reichenbachii is native to the northern Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Cultivation and propagation E. reichenbachii prefer full sun and require little water. They thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat tolerant, and grow well under glass.; : loam soil and grown under glass. They are drought resistant, but susceptible to mealybugs and scale insects. Propagation is facilitated by seeds collected as the fruits begin to dry.

Founded in 1946 as an independent, private institution, it was acquired by Arizona State University (ASU) in 2014. The school derives its name from Thunderbird Field No. 1, a decommissioned World War II-era US Army Air Forces base which served as its campus for more than 70 years. The school has since moved to ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus, and construction of a new, US$75 million building in downtown Phoenix is expected to be completed in 2021. As of 2018, the school had around 45,000 alumni, also referred to as \\"Thunderbirds\\" (or \\"T-Birds\\"). Thunderbird offers graduate-level degree programs at ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus, Executive Education courses at multiple locations, including Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and two undergraduate degrees with courses taught at ASU's West campus in Glendale, Arizona.  History  = Early history = The American Institute for Foreign Trade was founded by Lt. Gen. Barton Kyle Yount, a US Army Air Forces (AAF) officer who purchased the former Thunderbird Field from the War Assets Administration for one dollar, subject to the condition that the property be used for educational purposes for a minimum of 10 years. This led to short-lived controversy as journalists questioned the propriety of the transaction. As head of the Army Air Training Command, Yount had been recruited to the project by two AAF colonels, Finley Peter Dunne, Jr. and W. Stouder Thompson, who considered that the United States was (in Dunne's words) \\"notoriously short of personnel trained for foreign trade.\\" Yount agreed that \\"the young men who were going to foreign countries to represent American business were, in many cases, entirely untrained and unfit to represent their firms and their government.\\" The school was chartered as a nonprofit Arizona corporation on April 8, 1946. Over the next six months, Yount and Dunne (Thompson having departed the project) prepared the Glendale location, arranged financing, remodeled the physical plant (which included several airplane hangars and a control tower), and recruited faculty and students. Students were required to be \\"at least twenty years of age who, through study in college or the armed forces, have completed at least two years above high school, or the equivalent thereof.\\" This last provision was interpreted to allow military or work experience to substitute for formal university study. Classes officially began on October 1, 1946, with 285 students and 18 faculty members. (Early catalogues give these figures as 296 and 22, respectively.) 98% of the students attended on the G.I. Bill (provision was also made for the \\"instruction of wives\\"). The first certificates were awarded June 14, 1947. The program mixed business courses with instruction in Spanish or Portuguese languages and Latin American culture, for a \\"tripartite curriculum\\" consisting of international commerce, languages, and area studies. Course offerings soon expanded to include French language and Western European and \\"Far Eastern\\" area studies. In 1951, Thunderbird began granting the Bachelor of Foreign Trade to students who already possessed undergraduate degrees, or at least three years of coursework, while the others continued to be awarded certificates. Thunderbird thus became one of the first tertiary institutions to offer international business degrees. A Master of Foreign Trade degree began to be offered in 1952, and required four semesters of study, in contrast to two semesters for the bachelors. (This replaced an earlier system which distinguished between Course I and Course II of the bachelor's degree, the latter being more specialized and requiring one or two additional semesters.) Over the following decades, the master's degree—renamed the Master of International Management (MIM)--came to dominate, while the undergraduate program was phased out (and ceased to be awarded by 1975). The school accordingly changed its name to the \\"Thunderbird Graduate School of International Management\\" (in 1967), and then to the \\"American Graduate School of International Management\\" (in 1973). The American Management Association entered into some sort of relationship with the school, while the North Central Association granted Thunderbird regional accreditation in 1969 and 1974. Accreditation by the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business proved more elusive (and would not be granted until 1994), since Thunderbird did not then award the MBA degree, and indeed emphasized the \\"difference of degree\\" in its marketing materials. Over the 1970s and 1980s, enrollment rose to more than 1000, while Thunderbird's endowment also grew, reaching US$1 million in 1982 (and $20 million in the late 1990s). At the same time, Thunderbird began to experience competition from other American (and ultimately, foreign) business schools as international business increasingly became a mainstream subject. Thunderbird's relative poverty, and lack of affiliation with a full-fledged university, proved significant disadvantages, even as interest in business education skyrocketed during the Reagan administration. = 1990s and 2000s = Beginning in the 1990s, the school went by the name Thunderbird, the American Graduate School of International Management. After reaching a peak enrollment of around 1,600 in the 1990s, Thunderbird saw declining enrollment numbers in the 2000s. The school also saw a decline in the number of foreign students enrolled as a result of stricter visa rules enacted following the deadly terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Roughly half of Thunderbird's students are citizens of a country other than the U.S. This makeup is a major asset to the school because students are immersed in a group of cohorts from all over the world, which helps instill the school's celebrated Global Mindset. However, after 9/11 it became increasingly difficult for many overseas students to get permission to study in the United States, and that situation had a highly adverse impact on Thunderbird's enrollment. The global financial crisis of 2008 had a similarly harmful effect on Thunderbird's enrollment as students from overseas found it more difficult to afford studying abroad. In 2001, the school began to offer a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in International Management, replacing the previously offered Master of International Management. Three years later, the school changed its name to Thunderbird, the Garvin School of International Management, following a $13 million donation (part of a pledge that was originally planned to be $60 million) from alumnus Samuel Garvin. The same year, the school hired Ángel Cabrera to serve as president. Cabrera oversaw the school's 2006 adoption of their Professional Oath of Honor. The oath was developed with input from students and faculty and was considered by the school to be the first of its kind for business schools. Students sign the pledge upon graduation promising to act ethically and honestly in the business world (similar to the Hippocratic Oath taken by doctors). Garvin's name was removed from the school's name in 2007. The school began to use the name Thunderbird School of Global Management, to focus on the Thunderbird brand and highlight the school's focus on global business. At this time, Garvin's name was given to the newly created position, the Garvin Distinguished Professor of Global Management Research, and was still used for the Garvin Center of Cultures and Languages of International Management and the Garvin Professorship of Entrepreneurship. As part of the transition to the new name, the school adopted a logo of a mythical thunderbird with a globe-shaped body. Incidentally, the thunderbird of Native American mythology closely resembles the phoenix of Greek mythology, which Arizona's capital city is named for. = 2010s = In 2011, after efforts by a Thunderbird alumnus, Arizona began selling Thunderbird license plates. The following year, Larry Penley became the president of Thunderbird. In March 2013, the school announced a planned partnership with Laureate Education, Inc. As part of the planned partnership, Thunderbird would remain a nonprofit organization, exempt from income tax as a 501(c)(3), but would establish a joint educational service company with Laureate, a for-profit company. This joint company would launch an undergraduate program and expand online programs. Undergraduate students would attend Thunderbird for the final year of their undergraduate degree program. The planned partnership would allow Thunderbird to host events at Laureate campuses worldwide and establish Thunderbird campuses abroad. The school announced Paris, Madrid, Brazil and Chile as potential sites. According to the school, Laureate would have no influence over its academic decisions. Thunderbird would also retain degree-awarding powers. However, Laureate would be given three seats on the school's board. Under the agreement, Thunderbird would sell its campus to Laureate in a leaseback agreement. The school would continue to operate from its Glendale campus, but would use the money from the sale to pay off its debts. Thunderbird alumni would have the option to purchase the campus from Laureate within two years or the school may repurchase the campus at the end of the twenty-year lease agreement. As well, Laureate and Thunderbird had planned to invest $20 million and $10 million respectively to provide for campus improvements. The proposed agreement was protested by some Thunderbird alumni and board members who expressed concern about the impact that the partnership would have on the school's reputation. Many alumni felt the Laureate partnership would diminish the value of a Thunderbird degree. In response, alumni in opposition of the proposed agreement signed an online petition in protest. Additionally, some alumni formed the Thunderbird Independent Alumni Association, which expressed concerns over the agreement. Following the announcement of the planned agreement, five Thunderbird board members and seven members of the Thunderbird Alumni Network board resigned. The proposed agreement was also supported by other alumni and faculty whose statements were presented on the school's website. The planned structure change was approved by the school's board in June 2013, although The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the school's regional accreditor, did not approve the proposal. Thunderbird had stated that they anticipated that the agreement would be approved, as other Laureate schools are accredited through the Commission. , the school's president was Larry Penley and the school employed 48 faculty members. Later that year, Allen J. Morrison was appointed CEO and Director General of Thunderbird. The following year, the school finalized an agreement with Arizona State University to be integrated in a manner similar to a college within the university. Three years later, in 2018, ASU appointed Sanjeev Khagram as director general and dean of Thunderbird. In October 2019, ASU and Thunderbird held a groundbreaking ceremony to celebrate the start of construction on Thunderbird's new global headquarters facility adjacent to ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law on the Downtown Phoenix campus. The first classes in the new building will be held in the fall semester of 2021 when Thunderbird is celebrating its 75th anniversary.  Status within ASU  Thunderbird is described as a \\"unit of the Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise.\\" A unit, in contrast to a school or college (but like an \\"institute\\"), is said to be focused broadly, developing and disseminating knowledge throughout ASU. Accordingly, Thunderbird retains its own logo and other distinctive marketing dress.  Academics  Thunderbird's degrees have historically included the Bachelor of Foreign Trade (until 1975), the Master of International Management (until 2001), an MBA in Global Management (through 2016), and executive education programs. Since its acquisition by ASU, Thunderbird has revived the undergraduate program (the Bachelor of Global Management; its students are called \\"Underbirds\\"), phased out the MBA (which the Carey School already offered), and introduced the Master of Global Management, a non-MBA graduate degree with a number of formal concentrations. The school also offers a Micromasters program and certificate. = Rankings = Forbes ranked Thunderbird as the 54th best business school in the U.S. in 2011, and a 2012 report released by Bloomberg Businessweek ranked Thunderbird as the top international business program. Thunderbird was also ranked as the 5th most diverse school out of 82 schools surveyed, based on student responses about students' country of origin, gender and ethnicity. In 2013, The Financial Times ranked Thunderbird's executive education program ninth overall based on corporate client feedback to The Financial Times. Also in 2013, The Economist released ratings for online programs and gave Thunderbird a rating of \\"good\\", which was one step down from the publication's top rating of \\"excellent\\". In its 2014 rankings, published in 2013, U.S. News & World Report ranked Thunderbird as the best international business school in their annual rankings, marking the eighteenth consecutive year the school was named top international business program. In U.S. News & World Report's 2015 rankings, published in 2014, Thunderbird was ranked 85th for best business school, and second in the overall rankings for international business school. According to a 2019 Times Higher Education/Wall Street Journal report, Thunderbird is currently ranked number 1 in the world in Masters in Management programs for its specialized Masters in Global Management (MGM) degree. Publications Thunderbird International Business Review is one of several journals published by the school (six times a year).  Campuses  The original Thunderbird campus was located on the former World War II airfield Thunderbird Field No. 1. Located in Glendale, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, the airfield was built in 1941 and was used to train pilots. The school has utilized the existing buildings on the airfield and many of the school's classrooms are located in the airfield's former barracks. Arizona Christian University is the new owner and occupant of Thunderbird's former campus in Glendale. The airfield's air traffic control tower is still present on campus. Beginning in 2007, the tower underwent a restoration project at the urging of three Thunderbird students who raised $2.5 million for the project. The school was awarded the Ruth Bryne Historic Preservation Award by the city of Glendale for the renovation. The tower was occupied by the campus store, student lounges and a pub until the school relocated to Phoenix. Thunderbird's new building will feature a rooftop pub designed in the spirit of the iconic original. In 2011, one of the then-70-year-old airplane hangars on campus was removed. The building, named the Thunderbird Activity Center by the school, had been used for special events and exams, but was determined to no longer meet safety standards following an inspection of the campus. Thunderbird also has satellite Centers for Excellence in Moscow, Russia, Dubai, UAE, Geneva, Switzerland, Jakarta, Indonesia and Tokyo, Japan. The school has plans to open several new satellite Centers for Excellence (hub offices) in the next few years with a goal to have a global network of 20 satellite hubs by the year 2025. The hubs will support professional English education, recruiting, alumni and community engagement, and executive education. All the hubs will be connected to the global headquarters facility in downtown Phoenix using the latest digital technology, including virtual reality and augmented reality. The goal is for the headquarters to function as a digital and physical space that will connect the school's global network of 45,000 alumni with students, faculty, and staff. Other buildings on the original campus included the International Business Information Centre (IBIC), which was Thunderbird's library, and a dining hall for students. The school's campus also featured a Welcome Wall, which was built in 1992, and displayed greetings in different languages. On December 12, 2017 ASU announced that Thunderbird's historical campus will be closed and the school will be moved to a more modern facility in downtown Phoenix. As part of the move, the City of Phoenix agreed to invest $13.5M in the new building, a record investment for Thunderbird. ASU and Thunderbird are covering the remaining cost of the $75 million facility using funds from tuition and sale of land that ASU owns, including the old Glendale campus and another parcel in nearby Scottsdale.  Students  Students, alumni and faculty are often referred to as Thunderbirds or T-birds. Undergraduates call themselves \\"Underbirds.\\" Students run a school newspaper named Das Tor. For over 50 years, all graduates have been required to take a minimum of 4 semesters of foreign language or demonstrate equivalent proficiency. Other student activities include Thunderbird's several sports clubs. One of the longest lasting is the Thunderbird Rugby Football Club, founded in 1976. The club regularly hosts a tournament, the Thunderbird Rugby Invitational, with other business schools from around the U.S. Every year, one student of the graduating class is awarded the Barton Kyle Yount Award in honor of the school's founder and first president. The award is determined on the basis of scholarship, accomplishment and character. = Alumni = Thunderbird has a number of notable graduates, including Walid Chammah, former chairman of Morgan Stanley; Bob Dudley, the retired CEO of BP; and Luis Alberto Moreno, former Ambassador of Colombia to the United States and the current president of the Inter-American Development Bank. Lee Abbamonte, the youngest American to visit all 193 United Nations member states, graduated in 2010. Ramon Laguarta is currently the CEO of PepsiCo, and Mark Smucker is the CEO of The J.M.

Lebo and anthropologist James M. Bayman, writing in 2001, claim that the name is a modern misnomer, possibly originating in the early 20th century. Moʻolelo (oral accounts) from this period associate the name with the remnants of a stone structure to the southeast of the house, believed to be a heiau (temple) dedicated to Lono, the Hawaiian god of fertility and healing. Tradition states that the king may have chosen to build his house on the heiau because of the mana (spiritual power) associated with the area. The contemporaneous Hale Aliʻi (ʻIolani Palace) was built on the site of a heiau called Kaʻahaimauli. According to Lebo and Bayman, the actual region of Kaniakapūpū and Kaniakapūpū Heiau (also called Kawaluna Heiau) was located in the Waolani area of Oahu; contemporary records do not mention a heiau onsite or the king building his house on top of one. Kawaluna Heiau was associated with Kūaliʻi, the 16th-century aliʻi nui of Oahu, who asserted his control of the Kona district (the area encompassing much of modern Honolulu) after a ceremony at the temple. One of the earliest references to Kaniakapūpū and its association with Kawaluna Heiau was in the \\"Legend of Kamaakamahiai\\", published on August 13, 1870, in the Hawaiian-language newspaper Kuokoa. It stated: \\"...where the house of our King now stands. Kawaluna was its name in the old days and Kaniakapūpū is its name today\\". Luakaha (\\"place of relaxation\\") was the name of the property during the king's lifetime, and originates from the name of the traditional ʻili kū (land division) of the ahupuaʻa of Honolulu, which encompassed a third of the forested upper slopes of Nuʻuanu Valley. There are no records of the house itself having any specific name, though when it was in use it was referred to as \\"the king's house, cottage, or retreat in Luakaha or Nuʻuanu\\". Luakaha was one of the many strategic grounds occupied by King Kalanikūpule during King Kamehameha I's invasion of the island of Oahu in 1795. Traditions state that Kamehameha rested his troops near the site during this campaign, which culminated in the decisive Battle of Nuʻuanu in which many of the defeated Oahu warriors were pushed off the Nuʻuanu Pali to their deaths. History King Kamehameha III In the early 19th century, Honolulu was situated on a dust plain. The aridity and lack of water, save for the Nuʻuanu Stream, prompted many residents to seek reprieve a few miles outside of town in the forested uplands of the Nuʻuanu Valley. In this suburb, American missionaries, white merchants, and the Hawaiian royals built European-style homes to escape the summer heat. The site of Luakaha was located outside the city and was reachable by horse and carriage. The claim on the area was relinquished by Charles Kanaʻina during the Great Māhele of 1848, and it became a part of the Crown Lands. Kamehameha III also allocated a nearby piece of land to his advisor and friend Keoni Ana, who built Hānaiakamalama to be near the king. Kaniakapūpū was built prior to the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii moving to Honolulu from Lahaina in 1845. Along with Hale Aliʻi, the king's new official residence in the center of town, and a summer retreat in the Nuʻuanu Valley, the new royal residences were built to resemble the spatial-cultural geography of Mokuʻula, the king's royal residential complex in Lahaina. On July 5, 1842, American missionary Amos Starr Cooke, the teacher of Royal School, wrote in his journal that Governor Kekūanāoʻa was in the process of building a \\"stone house\\" for the king in Luakaha. The retreat was completed in 1845 and became a place for entertaining foreign celebrities, chiefs, and commoners. On Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day (Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea) in 1847, King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama hosted a grand luau at the palace. The celebration commemorated the fourth anniversary of the restoration of Hawaiian independence and sovereignty by British Rear-Admiral Richard Darton Thomas, following a five- month British occupation of the kingdom during the Paulet Affair of 1843. The luau was attended by an estimated ten thousand guests.; ; The palace may also have been the site of an earlier luau, or great ahaʻaina (feast), which was part of the initial ten-day restoration festivities in 1842. Children from the Royal School, including all of the future Hawaiian monarchs, often visited with their teachers (the Cookes). By 1874, a map of the region labeled the area as the \\"Old Ruins\\", implying a dilapidated state. No records exist as to why the site was abandoned. =Contemporary descriptions= Danish explorer Steen Anderson Bille visited Oahu in October 1846 while circumnavigating the globe on the corvette Galathea between 1845 and 1847. Besides having an audience with King Kamehameha III at Hale Aliʻi, and commenting on Honolulu social life, Bille wrote a description of Luakaha: Another account was written in 1908 by Gorham D. Gilman, a New England merchant who resided in Lahaina and Honolulu from 1840 to 1861: Modern conservation Ruins of Kaniakapūpū, 2015 The area was rediscovered in the 1950s, and the Territorial Commission on Historic Sites cleared and stabilized the ruins onsite. However, the site deteriorated over the next 30 years due to a lack of maintenance. A fund was created by the Historic Hawaii Foundation in 1998 to pay for preservation work on the ruins, which was completed two years later. An archaeological survey was also conducted around this time. Today, the site is managed by the State Historic Preservation Division of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) with the help of the Historic Hawaii Foundation and other local preservation organizations, including the Aha Hui Malama O Kaniakapūpū. Kaniakapūpū was added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Kaniakapūpū is located at the end of an unmarked trail off the Pali Highway. The property is near the Luakaha Falls, and the surrounding area and trail leading up to the site are covered by a forest of invasive bamboo. Periodic clearing is necessary in order to halt the deteriorating effects of invasive root growth. The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially off-limits to the public, although state DLNR officials do not regularly monitor the site. Trespassers are subjected to citations if caught. =Vandalism= In 2016, Kaniakapūpū was damaged by vandals who scratched crosses into the historic stone walls. Previously, tourists had etched initials and other markings, while others often leaned, sat, or climbed on the walls for photo shoots. These actions further degraded the ancient structure. State DLNR officials and volunteers denounced these acts as \\"utter disrespect\\" for the cultural importance of the site. Social media was blamed for bringing unwanted visitors to the site and not pointing out that the area is off-limits to the public. Following these acts of vandalism, the state of Hawaii asked for the removal of directions to Kaniakapūpū on many social media websites and tourism blogs, and encouraged those who knew the direction to the ruins to come with respect.; ; ; ; Plaque Historical plaque at the ruins of Kaniakapūpū A plaque was erected at Kaniakapūpū by the Commission on Historical Sites, which reads: See also * Hānaiakamalama, the summer palace of Queen Emma and King Kamehameha IV References Bibliography          External links  * Royal residences in Hawaii Hawaiian architecture Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii History of Oahu Houses in Honolulu County, Hawaii Ruins in the United States National Register of Historic Places in Honolulu County, Hawaii ","title":"Kaniakapupu"},{"id":"9752842","text":"Dame Louisa Innes Lumsden (31 December 1840 – 2 January 1935) born in Aberdeen, Scotland, was a pioneer of female education. Louisa Lumsden was a student and a tutor in classics at Girton College, Cambridge, the first Headmistress of St Leonards School, Fife, and the first warden of University Hall, University of St Andrews. She is credited with introducing lacrosse to St Leonards School. When the Scottish suffrage organisations organised the planting of a commemorative tree to celebrate (some) women getting the vote in 1918 then Lumsden had the honour of planting The Suffragette Oak.  Early life  Louisa Lumsden was the third daughter and final of seven children of Clements Lumsden, advocate in Aberdeen and Writer to the Signet, and Jane Forbes. Following the death of her father in 1853, when she was 12, Louisa's mother moved temporarily to Cheltenham and Louisa attended a private school there, followed by a period as a boarder at the Chateau de Koekelberg, Brussels, and left there in 1856 to attend a smaller school in London. She returned to live at home with her family in Aberdeenshire in 1857.  University education  The Edinburgh Ladies Education Association, later the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women, ran classes for women with lectures given by University of Edinburgh professors. Louisa Lumsden attended classes in the winter of 1868-9. However women students were not entitled to full access to degrees. A college for women was established by Emily Davies in 1869 in Hitchin a village 27 miles from Cambridge, as the first college for women students studying for the Cambridge Tripos examinations on equal terms with men. As Girton College it moved to new buildings at its present site in 1873.Girton Pioneers college song commemorating the first three women to gain the Cambridge Tripos. Louisa Lumsden was one of the first five students to be taught at the Hitchin women's college and one of the first three female students to sit University of Cambridge Tripos examinations unofficially in Lent term 1873, the others being Rachel Cook and Sarah Woodhead; these three were commemorated in song as the Girton Pioneers. Louisa Lumsden is recorded as having been a student at Girton between 1869 and 1872, a tutor 1873-4 and awarded the Classical Tripos in 1892. She resigned her post as tutor after conflicts with Emily Davies about neglect of student welfare.McWilliams-Tullberg, Rita, Women at Cambridge: a men's university, though of a mixed type, Gollancz 1975, p 66  St Leonards School  A girls school was founded in St Andrews, Fife, in 1877 and Louisa Lumsden was its first headmistress (1877-1882). St Leonards was the first school for young women in Scotland modelled on an English public school; the progressive curriculum included classics, mathematics and sports. Prior to this Lumsden had been teaching classics at Cheltenham Ladies College (1876-7). Louisa Lumsden's close friend from her Cambridge days, Constance Maynard, accompanied her from Cheltenham to St Andrews and helped to establish the school. Maynard left in 1880 and went on to become the first principal of Westfield College (1882–1913). Louisa Lumsden resigned as headmistress in January 1882 citing ill health and Frances Dove, who also studied at Girton and taught at Cheltenham, was appointed to St Leonards.  Lacrosse  Lumsden, in a letter written home from the White Mountains in New Hampshire dated 6 September 1884, recounted her visit to watch the Canghuwaya Indians play lacrosse against the Montreal Club in Montreal. She wrote: It is a wonderful game, beautiful and graceful. (I was so charmed with it that I introduced it at St Leonards.)\\" Rosabelle Sinclair, who established the first women's lacrosse team in the United States attended St Leonards between 1906 and 1910. Rosabelle Sinclair established lacrosse for girls at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland.  University Hall  University Hall, the first residential hall for women students in Scotland, was founded at St Andrews University in 1895 and Louisa Lumsden was appointed its first warden. The intention was to create a Scottish version of Girton, but it met some resistance from both men and some of the female students it was intended for and Lumsden resigned her post in 1900.  Women's emancipation  In 1908 Louisa Lumsden accepted an invitation to become president of the Aberdeen Suffrage Association. She was a non-militant suffragist and provided a caravan called 'Curlew' which was used by campaigners to travel around the country. In 1913 she made a speech at a rally in Hyde Park, London, on behalf of the Scottish branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and later became one of a number of vice-presidents of the Scottish Churches' League for Woman Suffrage. She was the person who planted The Suffragette Oak in Glasgow which was tree of the year in 2015.  Recognition  Louisa Lumsden was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D) by St Andrews University at the university's Quincentenary celebrations in 1911. Under a Girton College charter, Louisa Lumsden was made a life governor of Girton in 1924. She was created a dame in 1925. The Lumsden Club is named in honour of Louisa Lumsden; its members are current female students at the University of St Andrews and its objective is charitable fund raising.

Endogenous human type I IFNs include many subtypes, such as interferons-α, -β, -ε, -κ, -ω, and -ζ.  Function  Activation of various innate immune signaling pathways (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, cGAS, RIG-I, MDA-5) leads to the rapid induction of type I IFNs due to their (mostly) intronless gene structure. The regulatory elements upstream of type I IFN genes differ, allowing differential transcription of type I IFNs in response to stimuli. In particular, IFNβ contains a κB regulatory site, whereas IFNα subtypes do not. Production of specific type I IFNs is usually limited to a small number of type I IFN subtypes. Once secreted, type I IFNs signal through IFNAR in a paracrine and autocrine manner. IFNAR is a heteromeric cell surface receptor composed of two subunits, referred to as the low affinity subunit, IFNAR1, and the high affinity subunit, IFNAR2. Upon binding of type I interferons, IFNAR activates the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, along with MAPK, PI3K, and Akt signaling pathways. IFNAR agonism results in transcriptional changes, with the potential to increase or suppress the transcription of over 2000 different genes. For example, type I IFNs induce interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, classically resulting in a robust anti-viral immune response. Additionally, IFNs largely impact cell health and viability, with effects on apoptosis, autophagy, cell differentiation, and proliferation. The diverse effects of type I IFNs is likely dependent on the cellular and environmental context. Different responses, e.g. antiviral versus antiproliferative responses, to type I IFNs subtypes have been studied and proximal signaling, such as STAT phosphorylation, does not appear to correlate with the outcome. Furthermore, while differential effects manifest after several days of chronic stimulation, changes to receptor structure, orientation, or stoichiometry have not elucidated the cause for differential signaling via different type I IFN subtypes. Current hypotheses for differential signaling include ligand- specific differences to the stability, or lifetime, of the ternary complex, ligand-induced changes to internalization and trafficking of the receptor and currently unappreciated differences to ligand-receptor structure. Structure Type I IFN receptor forms a ternary complex, composed of its two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and a type I IFN ligand. Ligand binding to either subunit is required for and precedes dimerization and activation of the receptor. Each subunit of IFNAR contains an N-terminal ligand binding domain (with two or four fibronectin type II-like subdomains, for IFNAR2 and IFNAR1, respectively), a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Each type I IFN ligand contains a \\"hotspot\\", or a sequence of conserved amino acids that are involved in binding to the receptor, specifically the high affinity receptor IFNAR2, which determines the affinity of each ligand for the receptor. Structural analysis of type I IFN receptor with different type I IFN ligand subtypes revealed a similar binding site for the different agonists. Mutagenesis studies of type I IFNs, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 demonstrated important binding residues, i.e. \\"hotspots\\", on the type I IFN subtypes which influenced its ability to bind to IFNAR2. Type I IFN binding to IFNAR1 was less strongly impacted by mutating single amino acids to alanine. Importantly, structural studies have not revealed differences in ternary complex structures with IFNAR and various type I IFN subtypes, despite differences in ligand affinities. The evolutionary conservation of type I IFN subtypes binding the same IFNAR receptor at the same site with differing affinities suggests that type I IFNs are nonredundant and potentially regulate different cellular responses. Efforts to engineer a more potent IFNα2 elicited a cellular response similar to IFNβ, suggesting that the affinity of type I IFNs for IFNAR has an important role in regulating the downstream response. = Subunits = Human IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 genes are located on chromosome 21q22.1.  IFNAR1  IFNAR1 is the low affinity subunit, originally cloned in 1990, and is composed of four fibronectin type II-like (FNII-like) subdomains, termed SD1-4. Type I IFNs bind SD1-3 with a typical binding affinity between 0.5–5μM; IFNα1 and IFNβ are exceptions with binding affinities of 220nM and 100nM, respectively. Type I IFNs have a binding association rate of 5x105M/s with a variable dissociation rate that determines type I IFN subtype affinity for IFNAR1. IFNAR1 cytoplasmic domain associates with Tyk2 and Tyk2 is required for membrane expression of IFNAR1. In the absence of Tyk2, a cytoplasmic IFNAR1 motif is phosphorylated, inducing receptor internalization. IFNAR1 then localizes to the perinuclear endosomal compartment and is degraded. Tyk2 null cells retain some responsiveness to IFNβ. However, responsiveness to IFNα is ablated, likely due to the reduced IFNAR1 membrane expression. IFNAR1 binding to low affinity ligands, such as IFNα subtypes, has been proposed to be the rate limiting step in the ternary complex formation. Therefore, if membrane levels of IFNAR1 are too low, the binary IFNα-IFNAR2 complex will be unable to recruit it to induce signaling. This hypothesis is supported by observations that cell lines with low IFNAR1 expression respond to IFNβ but not IFNα.  IFNAR2  IFNAR2 is the high affinity subunit, originally cloned in 1994, composed of two FNII-like subdomains, termed D1 and D2. Type I IFNs bind D1 and D2 with a typical binding affinity between 0.4–5nM; IFNβ binds at a slightly lower affinity (0.1nM). Type I IFNs have a binding association rate of 10−6–10−7M/s with a variable dissociation rate that determines type I IFN subtype affinity for IFNAR2. This modified schematic shows each subunit independently binding the type I IFN ligand and recruiting the corresponding subunit. The IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 binding motifs on type I IFNs are approximately 180 degrees from each other. IFNAR is composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Each IFNAR subunit contains an N-terminal ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal intracellular tail. IFNAR1 is the low affinity subunit, with four N-terminal subdomains. Binding to type I IFN is mediated by subdomains SD1, SD2 and SD3. IFNAR1's C-terminal tail interacts with Tyk2. IFNAR2 is the high affinity subunit, composed of two N-terminal subdomains. Binding to type I IFN is mediated by D1 and D2. IFNAR2's C-terminal tail interacts with JAK1. IFNAR2 is expressed as three isoforms due to alternative splicing, exon skipping, and multiple polyadenylation sites; IFNAR2a (a soluble form lacking the TM domain), IFNAR2b (a soluble form lacking the cytoplasmic domain), and IFNAR2c (the membrane bound, signaling- competent form). The cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR2c associates with JAK1.  Signaling  Type I IFNs bind to IFNAR1 or IFNAR2, forming a binary complex. The binary complex further recruits the remaining IFNAR subunit, completing the ternary complex and activating downstream JAK/STAT signaling. IFN ligation to IFNAR brings the receptor associated kinases, JAK1 and Tyk2, into close proximity, resulting in kinase transphosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosines on IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Phosphotyrosine residues on IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 recruit STAT proteins (classically STAT1, STAT2, or STAT3, although STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6 may play a role in certain cell types) via their SH2 domains. Once recruited, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by which induces their homo- or heterodimerization. These dimers translocate to the nucleus, binding interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and gamma activating sequences (GAS), promoting gene transcription. = Regulation = Under normal conditions, type I IFN levels are homeostatically regulated to balance the benefits of protection from viral infection with the other cellular effects associated with type I IFN signaling, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and immune modulation. The stringent regulation of type I IFN signaling suggests the importance of timing and location. Type I IFN signaling is controlled through various mechanisms, including differential expression of signaling components, differential signaling following IFNAR engagement, endocytosis and downregulation of the receptors. and negative feedback mechanisms  Differential expression  Responsiveness to type I IFNs requires the expression of signaling components within a given target cell, including IFNAR and STATs. Expression levels and post-translational modifications to IFNAR and STATs can modify cell responsiveness. Importantly, signaling is impacted by different STAT protein expression levels and activation of STAT heterodimers and STAT homodimers; reducing STAT expression levels alters antiviral, antiproliferative and inflammatory responses to type I IFNs. Conversely, increased expression of STAT1 and IRF9 maintain ISG expression, even in the absence of on-going cytokine receptor signaling, thereby amplifying IFNAR signaling. Because type I IFN signaling modulates proteins involved in protein translation, it can also indirectly alter protein levels of induced genes and proteins involved in pathway signaling. Type I IFN subtypes, ranging from 30–70% homology, all bind the same receptor. Biased agonism has been studied in order to better understand how a single receptor responds differently to multiple cognate ligands, culminating in disparate outcomes.  Endocytosis and downregulation  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 can be internalized through endocytosis in response to agonism through clathrin- dependent and clathrin-independent mechanisms. IFNAR subunits can be differentially downregulated following IFN stimulation. For example, membrane IFNAR1 is reduced in response to IFNα, but surface levels IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are downregulated in response to IFNβ binding. In agreement with these observations, IFNAR internalization is often associated with the respective agonist's ability to induce an anti-proliferative effect. IFNAR subunit internalization is also observed under basal conditions, with greater basal turnover of IFNAR1 than IFNAR2. IFNAR1 contains a degron, or a motif for ubiquitination, which allows for its internalization and degradation. Tyk2 may block this degron, preventing its internalization. = Clathrin-dependent endocytosis = Following receptor agonism, the C-terminus of IFNAR is phosphorylated, followed by its ubiquitination and internalization. IFNAR surface expression is maintained in the presence of stimulation when the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway is inhibited with siRNA knockdown of clathrin or using a small molecule inhibitor of the GTPase dynamin. Internalization can result in degradation of the receptor, thereby reducing membrane expression, or it can result in recycling of the receptor without an extended impact on membrane receptor levels. However, clathrin-mediated endocytosis may also serve to concentrate the IFNAR receptors and signaling components, thereby amplifying signaling. Electron microscopy experiments show IFNAR receptors concentrated in clathrin-coated pits, and inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in reduced phosphorylation of JAK1, Tyk2, STATs and reduced STAT nuclear translocation.  Negative feedback mechanisms  Negative regulators of type I IFN signaling, such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), are induced after 4 hours. SOCS1 inhibits type I IFN signaling by inhibiting JAKs and binding phosphorylated Tyk2. USP18 binds to the C terminus of IFNAR2. USP18 may regulate type I IFN signaling by interfering with ternary complex formation, not through its peptidase function. Loss of USP18 results in an inflammatory interferon-mediated CNS disease.  Clinical implications  Type I IFN can provide both beneficial or deleterious effects in a variety of diseases. Type I IFN is thought to be a driver in multiple autoimmune diseases and may have a role in chronic infection. Conversely, type I IFNs are also prescribed as therapeutics in other disease indications. In particular, type I IFN are implicated in the pathogenesis of the following autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and myositis. Increased levels of intracerebral IFNα are also thought to play a detrimental role in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS), HIV-associated dementia and CNS lupus. While type I IFNs are one of the classical cytokines required for an effect antiviral response, higher type I IFN levels are associated with worsening disease in bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis and lepromatous leprosy. Type I IFN is also being investigated for a potential role in neurodegeneration; loss of IFNAR expression prolonged survival in murine models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). IFNα has also been used in the clinic for the treatment of type I IFN responsive hematological malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma, and hairy cell leukemia. Importantly, type I IFN-resistant cancers have been shown to have low or absent IFNAR expression. Additionally, IFNα was also given therapeutically for the treatment of some potentially chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Paradoxically, IFNβ was first-line treatment for the central autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), although the mechanism of action for IFNβ in MS has not been definitively demonstrated.

In 1868, before Ishpeming was incorporated as a village in 1869 and a city four years later, a charter to form a school district was granted. The meeting to organize the school district was called by Julius Ropes who started the Ropes Gold Mine north of town. The first school house in the district was built at the Cleveland Mine, Michigan. It was a single story frame building which was closed in 1870, with a new school being erected on Ready Street at a cost of $2,000. In 1874 the Division Street School was built at a cost of 38,000 dollars. This is the site of the current high school. It was said that the building was poorly constructed and teachers would complain about hauling coal to their room's individual coal stove. In 1908 the school was demolished to make room for a better planned high school. This new high school was built in 1908, but like the previous building, it had a relatively short life. In 1930, it was destroyed by fire and students attended classes in various community buildings. The following year the high school was rebuilt and it still is the functioning high school for the district. The high school, however, has seen several updates in recent years. These updates include a new gymnasium and a completely renovated Technology and Fine Arts wing. In addition to the Division Street School, Ishpeming has had several other school buildings. One of them was the High Street School, which was built in 1896. This school was later demolished to make room for the C.L. Phelps Middle School which was built and dedicated in 1959. At the time the school was hailed for its possession of a large arts wing, industrial art facilities, in addition to a home economics space. The C.L. Phelps school was closed by the district in 2010 and was subsequently sold to G.A. Haan Development in 2014. Haan Development purchased the building to renovate it into a multi-unit apartment complex.http://abc10up.com/downstate-developer- breathes-new-life-into-ishpeming-school/ In 1957 the district completed the Birchview Elementary school located in the eighth addition. This school originally contained only eight classrooms, however it was expanded in 1971 to accommodate an influx in the student population. In 2014, voters approved a Bond Proposal which expanded and upgraded the school by adding classrooms and computer labs. Ishpeming High School Ishpeming High School offers its students several courses, extracurricular activities, and athletics. The high school has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association (NCA) since 1909.http://www.advanc- ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=22328 The school offers courses in Business, Foreign Languages (including Spanish, French, and German), Physical Education, Health, Industrial Technology, Mathematics, Language Arts, Science, and Social Studies. The high school also offers Advanced Placement English in addition to Advanced Chemistry and Biology. The High School also offers a Geometry in Construction Class that is being used as a State Model for CTE instruction.http://abc10up.com/local-high-school- students-get-more-out-of-geometry-class/ Outside of courses Ishpeming High School offers several extracurricular activities including Key Club, Drama, Yearbook, Great Books, Forensics, High School Bowl, National Honor Society, Student Council, Youth in Government, and S.A.D.D. The Ishpeming Hematites (the athletic teams for the high school) also offer several programs to students.

On the same day, other fires burned the cities of Holland and Manistee, Michigan, as well as broad swaths of forest in various areas of the state; the Great Chicago Fire and the Peshtigo Fire also occurred on the same day. At least 50 people died as a result of the Port Huron Fire, and at least 200 from all the fires in the state.  Origins  The origins of the fires are unknown, but the damage was worsened by a number of factors. Uninterrupted drought had plagued the Midwest into early October and winds were strong. When the wind increased and shifted direction, fire fighters were unable to control the flames any longer. Vast tracts of forest burned for a week in parts of Michigan and Wisconsin. Within hours, several Midwestern cities and towns were reduced to charcoal and ash.  Contemporary fires  That same night, the Great Chicago Fire erupted in Illinois, and the Peshtigo Fire burned a large tract in Wisconsin, including the city of Peshtigo. Windsor, Ontario met a similar fate four days later. Much of the area burned by the Port Huron Fire of 1871 was swept by another deadly conflagration ten years later, under similar conditions.

It is the most recognizable part of the complex, being the actual \\"house\\" part of the White House. This central building, first constructed from 1792 to 1800, is home to the president of the United States and the first family. The Executive Residence primarily occupies four floors: the Ground Floor, the State Floor, the Second Floor, and the Third Floor. A two-story sub-basement with mezzanine, created during the 1948–to-1952 Truman reconstruction, is used for HVAC and mechanical systems, storage, and service areas. Sub-basement and sub-basement mezzanine This level was added during the 1948-to-1952 renovation, and contains the air conditioning and water softening equipment. The sub-basement and mezzanine also contain storage areas, the heating system, elevator machinery rooms, an incinerator, a medical clinic, a dentist's office, the electrical control system, a laundry room, and flatware and dishware storage. Ground Floor =Original kitchen and ancillary spaces= The Ground Floor of the White House originally contained service rooms. The White House is built on a small slight hill that slopes to the south. To provide access to the north side of the Ground Floor, the area around the north side of the mansion and its northeast and northwest corners was excavated to provide light and air to this half of the Ground Floor. Architect James Hoban designed the Ground Floor so that the kitchen was directly beneath the Entrance Hall, the door to the kitchen below the North Portico. Storerooms were east of the kitchen, while a toilet and dishwashing room were to the west. The kitchen was relocated into the two rooms in the northwest corner of the Ground Floor by 1846, while the old kitchen space was transformed into an informal sitting room/reception space. As of 2010, this large central space, originally occupied by the kitchen in the early 1800s, had been subdivided into offices for the White House curator and the United States Secret Service. The kitchen, too, continues to occupy the three rooms, somewhat altered in size now, in the northwest corner of the Ground Floor. The storeroom to the east of the kitchen became a pantry in 1809, a meat locker in 1825, and then a flight of stairs leading to the State Floor by 1946. This area remains largely unchanged as of 2010, with the exception of the narrowing of the stairs in 1952 to create an elevator shaft. =Library and ancillary spaces= The storeroom in the northeast corner of the Ground Floor remained in use as storage space only until 1809, when it became a laundry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt hired the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White to renovate the White House. They turned the room into a \\"gentleman's anteroom\\". This room became the White House Library in 1935. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy radically transformed the room in 1961. Kennedy consulted initially with a group consisting of members of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, designers from the American Institute of Interior Designers (AIID), and historians. The AIID agreed to take on the job of refurbishing the room, and Kennedy worked with decorator Jeanette Becker Lenygon of the AIID on the project. Lenygon designed an early American library room in the Federal style. Except for minor decorative changes, the White House Library remains the same as of 2010. The toilet and laundry room west of the kitchen became general-use work areas by 1809, and a pantry, small kitchen, and cook's office by 1825. By 1946, these had become general workrooms, with a narrow, winding staircase inserted into the room closest to the former kitchen. The 1952 renovation turned the winding staircase into a steep, straight stairs and added an elevator in this space. As of 2010, a pantry-sized refrigerator also occupied a portion of this space. =Diplomatic Reception Room= The Diplomatic Reception Room on the Ground Floor of the White House. The oval space beneath what is now the Blue Room was originally a Servants' Hall, but was turned into a furnace room in 1837. During the White House's 1902 renovation, the room was turned into a sitting room. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used it for his \\"fireside chat\\" radio broadcasts in the 1930s. Rebuilt (along with the rest of the gutted White House) during the 1948-to-1952 renovation, the room became the Diplomatic Reception Room. It was only sparsely furnished until First Lady Mamie Eisenhower received a large donation of museum-quality antique furniture from the National Society of Interior Designers in 1960. Except for decorative updating, it remains unchanged as of 2010. =Map Room= West of the Servants' Hall, the Ground Floor originally contained a small bedroom and, in the two westernmost rooms, a Steward's Office. The smaller, westernmost of the two rooms in the Steward's Office became the White House vault. By 1825, the Housekeeper's Office had moved into the easternmost room of the Steward's Office. The Steward's Office and vault became general workrooms by 1946, but the 1902 renovation had turned the Housekeeper's Office into a ladies' powder room. Less than a decade later, President Woodrow Wilson turned it into a billiards room. At the outbreak of World War II in December 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt removed the billiards table and turned the room into a place where he could keep track of the war's progress on a wide range of maps and store top-secret communications with world leaders. The Map Room (as it was now called) was heavily guarded, as highly secret U.S. and allied military information was constantly updated on the maps kept in this room. In the early 1960s, the Map Room was transformed into a ladies' powder room again by Jacqueline Kennedy, and portraits of first ladies were hung there. The Map Room continued to retain its name, but in 1970 was decorated in the Chippendale style and turned into a reception room. It retained its name and function as of 2010. A small medical clinic and the office of the White House physician occupy the three rooms to the west of the Map Room as of 2010. =Vermeil Room= East of the original Servants' Hall was the Housekeeper's Office, and then a room for general work. The Housekeeper's Office was turned into general workspace in 1809, while the bedroom became a general-use servants' room. All rooms east of the oval Servant's Hall were turned into staff bedrooms by 1825 (with the Housekeeper's Office taking up a portion of the Steward's Office). In 1837, President Martin Van Buren made the bedroom that would become the China Room into quarters for a stoker, whose job was to keep the White House furnace fueled 24 hours a day, seven days a week (with summers off). First Lady Edith Wilson turned this room into the China Room in 1917 to display the Executive Residence's growing collection of White House china. Just east of the China Room, the 1902 renovation turned the staff bedroom into a sitting room known as the Social Room. It was briefly renamed the Billiard Room after the 1952 restoration, but became the Vermeil Room in 1957 after mining heiress Margaret Thompson Biddle bequeathed 1,575 pieces of vermeil silverware to the White House. It remained little changed as of 2010. =North Lawn extension= During the 1948-to-1952 reconstruction of the White House, additional White House workspace was excavated under the North Lawn. Storage space had first been excavated here in the 1930s, but was greatly expanded and enhanced during the Truman renovation. The Trumans included a bowling alley in this space as well (it is architecturally aligned with the entrance to the Diplomatic Reception Room on the other side of the White House). President Dwight Eisenhower had the bowling alley moved to the Executive Office Building west of the White House, but President Richard Nixon (an avid bowler) had it restored to its original spot in 1969. As of 2010, this space continues to house the bowling alley, as well as the White House chocolatier, the office and workspace of the White House chief floral designer, a cold storage room for flowers and other perishable items, a carpentry shop, and general workrooms. State Floor The East Room after its last redecoration in 1995. The Green Room in 1999. The Red Room during the George W. Bush administration. The Blue Room after its 1995 redecoration. The Family Dining Room after its February 2015 redecoration. The State Floor was unfinished when President John Adams moved into the White House on November 1, 1800. Work continued through the four remaining months of his presidency and into the first term of Thomas Jefferson to make the Executive Residence habitable. There were no floors in the East Room, the Blue Room, or the western third of the Cross Hall (which at that time extended all the way to the west, as the State Dining Room would not be extended all the way north until 1902). There was also no grand staircase east of the Entrance Hall, and the only way to access the Second Floor was via temporary stairs on the exterior of the building which led up to the top of the South Portico. =Entrance Hall and Grand Staircase= Until the North Portico was completed in 1829, providing access from the North Lawn and carriageway, the Entrance Hall was used as space to exhibit items brought back by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. A glass screen was placed between the columns along the Entrance Hall's south side in 1837 to reduce the hall's draftiness, effectively reducing its apparent size. A more elaborate iron frame was added to the partition in 1853. The ordinary glass and frame were replaced by a red, white, and blue colored glass screen designed by Tiffany & Co. in 1882. The Tiffany screen was removed in the 1902 renovation. The area that now contains the Grand Staircase originally contained a much smaller, unadorned staircase to the Second Floor. The Grand Staircase was moved into this area during the 1902 renovation. =East Room= Although architect James Hoban included space for the East Room in his 1792 plans for the White House, it was unclear what purpose the room should fulfill. The room's floor was finished after President John Adams moved in, but the walls remained bare brick and First Lady Abigail Adams famously hung her laundry to dry in it. Thomas Jefferson furnished the room with some chairs during his administration, and had the room partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both private secretary to the president). But it wasn't until 1807 that architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe gave the East Room its function as a site for public audiences and large social events. Rebuilt after the burning of the White House in 1814, its walls remained bare brick and it was used as storage space. President James Monroe's daughter was married in the East Room, at which time it was temporarily furnished, but it was not until the administration of John Quincy Adams that its walls were plastered and painted. The East Room was finally completed in 1829 under President Andrew Jackson. Major redecorations have occurred, but the room continues to serve its function as a site for large social events. =Green, Blue, and Red Rooms= James Hoban designated what is today the Green Room as a Common Dining Room, and Thomas Jefferson's family took their meals here. A rectangular ceiling fresco with small circles and trapezoids, designed by Thomas Ustick Walter, was added in 1853. In the 1902 renovation of the White House, a second door, south of the existing door, was cut from the Green Room to the Blue Room. At the same time, a new, southern door was cut from the Green Room to the East Room. Hoban's original plans for the White House created an oval-shaped Drawing Room (now the Blue Room) in the center of the south part of the executive mansion. Since its inception, the Blue Room has remained the centerpiece of the Executive Residence, serving as the formal reception space for heads of state, ambassadors, and other important people. Since its creation in 1801, it has been redecorated more times (18) than any other room in the White House. Originally, a door in the center of the western wall led to the Yellow Room. A fireplace was set in the eastern wall opposite the door. Originally, niches to either side of the door in the north wall mirrored the three windows in the south wall. The reconstruction of 1817 radically changed the Blue Room. Doors replaced the northern niches, and the western door to the Red Room was sealed. On the Red Room side of the wall, a false door was cut into the wall south of the now-sealed central door, and the false door north of the now-sealed door also concealed. An oval ceiling fresco with curved trapezoids, designed Thomas Ustick Walter, was added in 1853. A jib (or disguised) door was cut through the false door to the Red Room in 1891, and a second jib door cut through to the Green Room south of the fireplace in 1902. The ceiling medallion and cornice moldings were altered by architect Edward Vason Jones during the Nixon administration to more closely resemble early 1800s styles. To the west of this room was the President's Antechamber (later known as the Red Room). This room originally had two doors, set close together, leading into the Blue Room. (The one on the north was false.) Beginning in 1809, it became the music room for the White House. During the 1817 rebuilding of the White House, the President's Antechamber was turned into a Yellow Parlor. It was sometimes called the Washington Parlor, as the Gilbert Stuart painting of George Washington hung in this room after the Burning of Washington. At this time, the two doors were rebuilt further apart. (Now the south door became a false door.) In 1845, the Yellow Parlor was redecorated in crimson, and took its current name as the Red Room. A rectangular ceiling fresco with a small central circle, curved trapezoids, and half-moons, designed Thomas Ustick Walter, was added in 1853. The false door was cut through in 1891, and has remained open to the present. =State Dining Room= The northern third of what is now the State Dining Room was originally the western part of the Cross Hall. Two flights of stairs (one against the north wall, one against the south wall) led from the State Floor to the Second Floor. A single, central stair then led up to the Third Floor. Not completed when the White House was occupied in 1800, the Grand Stairs were probably finished by architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1803 or shortly thereafter. An extensive chimney breast was added to the fireplace in the room's west wall when it was reconstructed in 1817. A large greenhouse was added to the west side of the White House in 1857, replacing one on the east side which had been torn down that year to make way for expansion of the Treasury Building. The greenhouse burned down in 1867, and in 1869 President Ulysses S. Grant built a larger, higher greenhouse in its place. Later presidents expanded the greenhouse, until it occupied most of what is now the West Wing. Grant built a billiards room atop and to the south of the breezeway leading from the west end of the Ground Floor of the White House, but this became a Palm Court in 1877 during the Rutherford B. Hayes administration. Hayes authorized new doors cut through the stone of the mansion's walls to provide access between the Palm Court and State Dining Room. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant rebuilt the Grand Stair. Now, only a single staircase against the north wall led to the Second Floor, while a second stair on the south wall of the Second Floor led to the Third Floor. (The new space created on the Second Floor became the West Sitting Hall.) To the south of the Grand Stair was a smaller room, to be used as a Cabinet Room or President's Library. The 1817 reconstruction of the White House saw the Cabinet Room/Presidential Library turned into the State Dining Room. The White House was extensively renovated in 1902, during which the Grand Stair was demolished and a new Grand Staircase was built east of the Entrance Hall. The State Dining Room expanded northward into the space formerly occupied by the Grand Stair. The small fireplaces in the east and west walls of the State Dining Room were removed, and the northern door to the Palm Court sealed. (Another door to the Palm Court, beneath the former Grand Stairs, was also sealed.) Where the old Palm Court door existed, a new, massive stone fireplace and oversize mantel (the famous \\"Buffalo mantel\\") were added, to match the enlarged room's size and grandeur. The great Venetian window which formerly spanned the width of the Cross Hall in the mansion's west wall was reduced in size to the width of a standard First Floor window. A French door in the lower half of this window now led to the breezeway. The room was paneled in English oak in a Renaissance Revival style, and the furnishings replaced to turn the room into a Beaux-Arts baronial hall (complete with tapestries, cooking racks over the fireplace, and stuffed animal heads). During the 1948-to-1952 reconstruction of the White House, the State Dining Room was radically redecorated. The \\"Buffalo mantel\\" was not reused, and instead given to President Truman (who had it installed it in his presidential library). The oak paneling, heavily damaged during its removal, was reinstalled and given a coat of bright celadon green to hide the flaws. (Some of the frieze had to be recarved where it had been sanded down to accommodate the stuffed animal heads.) The painting scheme proved too much. Jacqueline Kennedy had the room painted bone white in 1961, but that proved too bright. The room was painted antique white in 1971 and again in 1981, and then off-white with an umber glaze in 1985. =Family Dining Room and Chief Usher's Office= As originally constructed, north of the Cross Hall was a Public Dining Room, a Porter's Lodge between the dining room and entrance hall, and a narrow, winding Private Stair. When the White House was rebuilt in 1817, the Public Dining Room became the Private Dining Room. The room was partitioned to make it smaller, and the western third of the room turned into a pantry. President James Monroe gave State Dinners in the Private Dining Room from 1817 to 1825, and subsequent presidents used it as a formal dining room for the first family or as a space for official but small events. By 1849 it was used primarily as a ladies' receiving room, a function it retained as late as 1865. During the White House's 1902 renovation, the pantry received a mezzanine to increase its utility. To the Family Dining Room were added a vaulted ceiling, faux paneling, and a frieze featuring Neoclassical designs. The frieze was broken by the high windows in the north wall, but the windows were lowered in 1961 and the frieze allowed to continue unbroken around the entire room. The faux paneling was also removed at this time, and the walls painted yellow. The Family Dining Room underwent its first significant renovation since the Kennedy years in 2015. First Lady Michelle Obama had the room painted a light grey, and the decor, furniture, rug, and artwork now reflect a mid-20th century modern look. The area immediately to the east of the Family Dining Room, tucked against the Entrance Hall, was originally service space. A porter's \\"lodge\\" (work and storage space) occupied the northern two-thirds of the space, while a narrow, sharping winding back stairs allowed servants to access the Second Floor. By 1801, the porter's space had become a generic workroom. It was made into a porter's lodge again in 1825. It retained this use as late as 1865. The renovation of 1902 moved the servants' staircase into the center of this area, creating a corridor on the north and west sides and a small closet to the south. After the 1948-to-1952 gutting and restoration of the White House, the northern space became the chief usher's office. It continued to retain this layout as of 2010. Second Floor The Grand Staircase, leading up to the Second Floor. The Second Floor contains the private living apartments of the first family, as well as a kitchen. Some of these rooms are used for official entertaining, but most are reserved for private use. Rooms found on the Second Floor include the Center Hall, East Sitting Hall, Lincoln Bedroom, Lincoln Sitting Room, President's Dining Room, Queens' Bedroom, Queens' Sitting Room, Treaty Room, West Sitting Hall, and Yellow Oval Room. The Truman Balcony is accessed from this floor. The Second Floor contains only seven historic rooms: the Lincoln Bedroom, the Lincoln Sitting Room, the Queens' Bedroom, the Queens' Sitting Room, the Treaty Room, the East Sitting Hall, and the Yellow Oval Room. The western half of the Second Floor contains family rooms, a kitchen, and the President's Dining Room, all of which may be redecorated or undergo architectural revision at the whim of the president. When the White House was occupied in 1801, the eastern half of the Second Floor remained unfinished. What would later be the Queens' Suite, Lincoln Suite, East Sitting Hall, Grand Stair, and Grand Stair Landing did not exist. Also unfinished was the West Sitting Hall, which was not intended to be a sitting hall at all but rather a \\"Grand Staircase\\" leading up from the Ground Floor. The Second Floor was completed by 1809. Before the Theodore Roosevelt renovation of 1902, the executive offices of the president were located at the east end of the second floor and the public had full and free access to these areas. =Center Hall, East Sitting Hall, and Grand Stair= Originally known as the Great Passage, the Center Hall has always been part of the design of the White House. But it has not always had the same structural design. Today, load-bearing walls outside the Treaty Room define the western side of the Stair Landing. But these walls did not exist when the White House was occupied in 1801. Today, the Center Hall, Stair Landing, and East Sitting Room are all on the same level. But in 1801, three small steps just outside the Treaty Room led up from the Great Passage to the East Sitting Room. Additionally, there was no Grand Stair north of the Stair Landing. When the White House opened, a simple, narrow private stair led from the Ground Floor up to the Second Floor where the Grand Stair is today. The Center Hall has always been used as a large drawing room and a waiting area for guests about to be shown into the Yellow Oval Room. Except for the addition of the Stair Landing, little has changed in the Center Hall. Only minor decorative elements have been altered, such as the addition of a cornice molding and bookshelves during the 1952 reconstruction. First Lady Laura Bush and Michelle Obama in the West Sitting Hall in 2008. The East Sitting Hall is one of the seven historic spaces on the Second Floor. In the first half of the 1800s, the White House was treated as a government office building rather than a residence, and members of the public expected nearly complete access to it. Anyone who wanted to see the President would ascend to the Second Floor using the private steps and wait in the East Sitting Hall. James Hoban, the original architect of the White House, planned and built a double-arched Venetian window here to provide as much light as possible to this area. After 1902, the public no longer had access to the Second Floor, and the area has been used as a small parlor. The East Sitting Hall was more distinctively set off from the Center Hall by the 1952 reconstruction. The steps leading from the Center Hall to the East Hall Room were removed, and small storage spaces added on the north and south side of the passage. This roughly halved the width of the hall here, which created a more private East Sitting Room. A very narrow servants stair was added in the north storage area to provide additional access to the Third Floor. Access to the Center Hall was originally provided by a Grand Staircase on the west end of the building. On the east end, a narrower set of stairs with a single return gave access. These plain stairs were replaced by the modern Grand Staircase. =Lincoln Bedroom and Sitting Room= The Lincoln Bedroom and the Lincoln Sitting Room are located in the southeast corner of the Second Floor. As originally designed and completed in 1809, this space contained two very narrow, north-south running bedchambers with a toilet room between them. By 1825, the toilet had been removed and the space joined to the west bedchamber to form the president's office. This area was used for the president's office over the next several decades. Abraham Lincoln used it as both an office and a Cabinet room, and signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the Lincoln Bedroom in 1863. The Lincoln Sitting Room was used as an office for presidential aides, although President John Tyler used it as part of his office from 1841 to 1845. The next major reconfiguration of this space occurred during the 1952 reconstruction of the White House, when a full bath and toilet were built in the northeast corner of the Lincoln Sitting Room. President Truman was the individual who conceived of dedicating the space to Lincoln. The desk in the bedroom was Lincoln's, and the long, wide rosewood bed is probably the one Willie Lincoln died in. The portrait of President Andrew Jackson that hangs in the room is one which Abraham Lincoln admired, and the Lincoln Bedroom has the only known copy of the Gettysburg Address signed, dated, and titled by Lincoln himself. The sitting room furnishings were all purchased by First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. They include four mahogany chairs, a chest in the late Empire style, and red and gold rugs and drapes. The small mahogany desk in the sitting room was constructed by James Hoban himself. The Lincoln Bedroom and Sitting Room were redecorated by First Lady Laura Bush, who changed the decor so it more accurately reflected tastes common during the American Civil War. The Lincoln Bedroom is usually used to house close friends of the president who are visiting the White House. =Queens' Bedroom and Sitting Room= The Queens' Bedroom in 2000. The Queens' Bedroom and Queens' Sitting Room occupy the northeast corner of the Second Floor. When this space was completed in 1809, it was a mirror of the Lincoln Suite to the south: two very narrow bedrooms with a toilet between them. And like the Lincoln Suite, the toilet was removed by 1825 and the toilet space joined with the western bedchamber. Instead of office space, however, the western two-thirds of this space was partitioned to create storage areas. The remaining bedroom became known as the Rose Bedroom or Pink Bedroom, after the color of its decorating scheme. It was reserved as a guest bedroom, and was most frequently used by the president's private secretaries—all of whom were male, and many of them sons of presidents. By 1865, the western storage space had been converted into a clerk's office. The first woman to regularly occupy the bedroom probably was Anna Roosevelt, who moved into the White House in 1944. The 1952 White House reconstruction created a full bath and toilet in the northeast corner of the sitting room. The name of the suite of rooms is taken from the number of female royalty who have stayed in the room: Elizabeth, queen consort of King George VI; Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom; Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands; and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. This bedroom is also where Winston Churchill stayed on his regular visits to confer with Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, during and after World War II. =Treaty Room= The Treaty Room is located between the Lincoln Suite and the Yellow Oval Room, on the south side of the east wing of the Executive Residence. When completed in 1809, it was intended to be a bedroom. By 1825, its function had changed so that it was now an audience chamber where people could meet with the president (whose office was next door to the east). By 1865, the room had been partitioned. A passage taking up the southern third of the room was created, to permit individuals to pass unobserved from the president's office directly into the White House Library (then occupying the Yellow Oval Room). What remained of the room was used for Cabinet meetings from 1865 to 1902. The space was then used as a sitting room from 1902 to 1961. The 1952 White House reconstruction removed the passage. A new door was opened in the southwest corner of the room so permit direct access to the Yellow Oval Room. The space became known as the Treaty Room after President John F. Kennedy signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the room in 1963. It's been used for important treaty signings ever since. President Richard Nixon signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the room in 1972, and President Jimmy Carter signed the Camp David Accords in the room in 1978. The room has undergone some changes in the past 25 years. First Lady Barbara Bush converted it into a private sitting room for the president. President George W. Bush had the room's historic paneling and its vibrant red, gold, and blue fabrics removed to alter it more to his own personal taste. President Barack Obama had the room redecorated in shades of beige, and continued its use as a private presidential study. A half-bathroom in the northwest corner of the Treaty Room remains as of 2015 almost untouched since its creation in 1952. It has green and white floor tile in a checkerboard pattern, and the plumbing pipes are exposed. =Yellow Oval Room= The Yellow Oval Room is the topmost of the Executive Residence's three oval rooms. Not yet furnished when the White House was first occupied, President John Adams used it as a levée room for New Year's Day celebrations on January 1, 1801. The room received its name after First Lady Dolley Madison decorated the room in yellow damask in 1809. The room served as a ladies' drawing room from 1809 to 1829, when it was turned into a ladies' toilet room under Andrew Jackson. It continued to be used as a ladies' toilet until about 1845. First Lady Abigail Fillmore turned it into a library about 1851. By 1865, the first major architectural change was made to the room when a doorway was cut into the room's southeast corner to provide access to the passage leading behind the Treaty Room to the Presidential Office in the southeast corner of the Second Floor. The Yellow Oval Room was turned into a family room and private presidential study by Abraham Lincoln, and it remained that way until 1952. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman referred to it informally as the \\"oval study\\", and used it as an informal working and meeting space. The White House reconstruction of 1952 saw additional major architectural changes to the room. The 1865 passage was removed, but the door to the Treaty Room remained. To balance the door aesthetically, a closet was created in the northeast corner of the Yellow Oval Room and an identical door used to close it off. In the west wall of the room, a door was cut to provide access to the presidential bedroom suite. President Dwight D. Eisenhower began the practice of using the Yellow Oval Room as a formal reception room. More recently, the space has served as a formal drawing room for the first family, and as a reception room where presidents greet dignitaries before lunches and dinners. =Presidential Bedroom Suite: The small bedroom/living room= The non-historic rooms of the Second Floor constitute the first family's private residence. As non-historic space, they may be reconfigured and redecorated in any way. From east to west, leading away from the Yellow Oval Room on the south side, are a small bedroom (with full bath), a large bedroom, and a dressing room (with full bath). The small bedroom west of the Yellow Oval Room was originally used as an \\"extra bedroom\\" beginning with President James Madison and concluding with the administration of President Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln slept in this room, and not the Lincoln Bedroom as is commonly assumed (due to its name). Other occupants of the room included Mary Johnson Stover (daughter of Andrew Jackson) and her three children; May and Jessie McElroy (nieces of President Chester Arthur), Russell Harrison (President Benjamin Harrison's adult son); Mary Harrison McKee (adult daughter of President Benjamin Harrison) and her two children; Quentin and Archie Roosevelt (sons of President Theodore Roosevelt); President Woodrow Wilson and his second wife, Edith Wilson; President Warren G. Harding; President Franklin D. Roosevelt; and President Harry S. Truman. During the 1952 renovation, a dressing room was built which straddled the wall between this room and the large bedroom to the west. This dressing room could only be accessed from the small bedroom. A full bath was also created in the northeast corner of the room. The space continued to be used as a bedroom by President Dwight D. Eisenhower; President John F. Kennedy; and President Richard Nixon—all of whom slept in the room. The room was turned into a living room and study by President Gerald Ford, and it has remained a study and living room into 2013. =Presidential Bedroom Suite: The large bedroom= The Presidential Bedroom Suite, after redecoration in 1981. To the west of this space is the large bedroom, which has usually been used by the president and first lady as their private bedroom. Sometimes a president and first lady sleep in the same room, but often they do not due to the president's early and late hours, and personal idiosyncrasies. When this room was completed in 1809, it was intended to be used as the president's bedroom. A tiny entry foyer was partitioned off at the north door, and the western part of the northern third of the room was occupied by a narrow hallway. This hallway connected to the north-south running dressing room on the western wall of the White House. A small toilet occupied the southern end of the dressing room. In this configuration, the large bedroom was occupied by President James Madison and his wife, Dolley; President Thomas Jefferson; President John Adams and his wife, Abigail; and President James Monroe and his wife, Elizabeth. The entry foyer and north passage were removed by 1825. The large bedroom was subsequently occupied by President John Quincy Adams and his wife, Louisa; President Andrew Jackson; President Van Buren; President John Tyler and his wives Letitia Christian Tyler and Julia Gardiner Tyler; and President James K. Polk and his wife, Sarah. A full bath was added to the dressing room by 1849. The large bedroom was then used by President Zachary Taylor and his wife, Margaret; President Millard Fillmore and his wife, Abigail; President Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane; President James Buchanan; and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. The northern passage (this time extending across the length of the room) was restored by 1865. An open doorframe in the south wall provided access to the bedroom to the south. The 1865 configuration was occupied by Senator David T. Patterson and his wife, Martha (daughter of President Andrew Johnson); President Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia; President Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife, Lucy; President James Garfield and his wife, Lucretia; Mary Arthur McElroy, sister of widowed president Chester Arthur; Ruth, Esther, and Marion Cleveland, young daughters of President Grover Cleveland; President Benjamin Harrison and his wife, Caroline; President Theodore Roosevelt and his wife, Edith; President William Howard Taft and his wife, Helen; President Woodrow Wilson and his first wife, Ellen Axson Wilson; President Warren G. Harding and his wife, Florence; President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace; and President Herbert Hoover and his wife, Lou. It was used as a sitting room by first ladies Eleanor Roosevelt and Bess Truman. The room underwent a major architectural change in 1952. The northeast corner of the room was intruded upon by a dressing room which extended from the small bedroom to the east. Another closet extended from the west into the northwest corner of the room. To accommodate these spaces, the northern wall of the large bedroom was made convex. It continued to be used as a sitting room by Bess Truman, but reverted to bedroom space in 1953. It has remained in its 1952 configuration ever since, and has been occupied by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower; First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy; First Lady Lady Bird Johnson; First Lady Pat Nixon; President Gerald R. Ford and his wife, Betty; President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn; President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy; President George H. W. Bush and his wife, Barbara; President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary; and President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. =Presidential Bedroom Suite: The dressing room= The Presidential Bedroom Suite dressing room was part of the Executive Residence when it was completed in 1809. A full bath was added to it some time before 1849. The bath was expanded to take up half the dressing room's space in the 1952 reconstruction. The dressing room has not always served as a dressing room, however. It served as a small bedroom for Susanna Adams, daughter of President John Adams; Louisa Smith, niece of First Lady Abigail Adams; Tad Lincoln, son of President Abraham Lincoln; Robert Johnson, son of President Andrew Johnson; Anne Thompson, nursemaid to the young children of President Grover Cleveland; First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; and First Lady Bess Truman. It was used as a private study by first ladies Lucy Webb Hayes and Lou Henry Hoover, and as a private dining room by President Woodrow Wilson and his second wife, Edith. First Lady Florence Harding used it as a dress storage room. It also served as a combination dressing room/sitting room/office to first ladies Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Michelle Obama used it as a dressing room. =West Sitting Hall= West Sitting Hall did not exist when the White House was completed in 1809. James Hoban's original design for the White House had a flight of stairs, one against the north wall and one against the south wall, on the Ground Floor. These rose to a landing, and then a single flight of stairs rose to the Second Floor. This left only a small area north and south of the staircase, which by 1865 was being called the West Hall. In 1869, President Grant rebuilt the stairs so that the single staircase rose against the south wall. This left what space there was in a single rather than divided area, making it more useful. The new space created on the Second Floor became the West Sitting Hall. Considered part of the first family's private space, the West Sitting Hall has undergone redecoration with every new presidency and is not considered a historic room. =Family Kitchen and President's Dining Room= The Family Kitchen and the President's Dining Room are located in the northwest corner of the Second Floor. The large bedroom which originally existed here was known as the \\"Prince of Wales Room\\", after Albert, Prince of Wales stayed in the room in 1860. When this part of the Executive Residence was completed in 1809, a bedroom suite occupied this space. What is now the private stairs and Cosmetology Room were the eastern chamber and closet of the suite, A bedroom and toilet occupied what is now the President's Dining Room, and a lady's dressing room was in the space currently occupied by the Family Kitchen, the kitchen storage space, and the pantry. This space was little changed by 1825. Since the private stairs from the Ground Floor were now complete, the closet in the eastern chamber was removed and a landing for the stairs inserted in the middle of the room. This effectively created an open storage area in the southern third of the chamber. First Lady Louisa Adams and her niece, Mary Hellen, used the bedroom and dressing room as a bedroom suite (but did not occupy the eastern chamber). From March 1829 to the summer of 1830, all three rooms were occupied by Jack and Emily Donelson and their four children. President William Henry Harrison used the larger bedroom as his personal bedroom during his 32-day presidency in 1841. Robert Tyler (son of President John Tyler), his wife, and daughter used all three rooms from April 1841 to March 1845. From 1845 to 1849, the bedroom, dressing room, and eastern chamber were used by Augusta Tabb Walker and her two small children. A full bath was added to the eastern chamber by 1865. To accommodate the bathroom, the stairs were moved from the middle to the southern part of the room, and the storage space eliminated. In this configuration, the bedroom was used by Willie Lincoln (who died in it). First Lady Eliza Johnson used the small eastern chamber as her bedroom, while the First Family used the larger bedroom as a living room. The large room was later used as a bedroom by Nellie Grant (daughter of President Ulysses S. Grant); Fanny Hayes (daughter of President Rutherford B. Hayes); Mary \\"Mollie\\" Garfield (daughter of President James Garfield); Ellen \\"Nell\\" Arthur (daughter of President Chester Arthur); President Grover Cleveland and First Lady Frances Cleveland; James Robert and Mary Harrison McKee and their two small children; President William McKinley and his wife, Ida; Alice Roosevelt (daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt) from September 1901 to February 1906; Ethel Roosevelt (daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt); First Lady Helen Taft; Eleanor Wilson (daughter of President Woodrow Wilson); Calvin Coolidge, Jr.; Lorena Hickok (journalist and aide to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt); and Margaret Truman (daughter of President Harry S. Truman). Major architectural changes to these spaces came in 1952. In the eastern chamber, the bathroom was removed, the stairs were widened, and the stairs moved back into the middle of the space. This created a new (and at last, enclosed) storage space south of the stairs. The passage from the eastern chamber to the bedroom was closed as well. The 1952 reconstruction turned the bedroom into a mirror image of the president's bedroom across the Center Hall. The bedroom's south wall was made convex, which created a walled-off dead space in the room's southeast corner. The southwest corner now became storage space accessible from the dressing room. After the reconstruction, Margaret Truman continued to use it as her bedroom. In 1953, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower turned it from a bedroom into a sitting room for her mother, Elivera \\"Minnie\\" Doud. In 1961, the bedroom suite was torn out. Jacqueline Kennedy thought the Family Dining Room on the State Floor was too cavernous and impersonal to raise a family in, and decided that a smaller, more intimate dining room (now the President's Dining Room) should be created on the Second Floor. A small kitchen took over the space which was once a dressing room, with a pantry and storage space occupying the southern half of the space. (The storage closet created in the now-convex room to the east was accessed from the new pantry.) The bedroom became the new President's Dining Room. =Cosmetology Room= What is known today as the Cosmetology Room was originally a series of small rooms used as work and storage space. It was turned into a bathroom by 1865. At some point before 1933, the bath in this space was removed and the area converted into a small office. First ladies Eleanor Roosevelt and Bess Truman used the space as their personal office. President Dwight Eisenhower used it as an art room, where he would paint. The Kennedys used it as a nursery for their two small children, and First Daughter Luci Johnson used it as a study. During the Nixon administration, the room was turned into a beauty salon and named the Cosmetology Room. First Lady Rosalynn Carter planned to renovate the Cosmetology Room, but left the job to First Lady Nancy Reagan. In 1981, the National Hairdressers and Cosmetologists Association paid for an $8,000 ($ in dollars) refurbishment of the Cosmetology Room. Added to the room were a $400 ($ in dollars) salmon-colored Louis XV lounge chair, $720 ($ in dollars) white leather side chair, $230 ($ in dollars) manicurist's stool, $346 ($ in dollars) enamel shampoo bowl, $1,200 ($ in dollars) pair of hair dryers, $1,800 ($ in dollars) in wallpaper featuring a pattern consisting of a minute Chinese-style medallion, $3,000 ($ in dollars) coral-colored handmade wool rug, white Lucite make-up center, green and red drapes, and dotted white batiste curtains from Switzerland. The space remained a beauty parlor into 2013. =West Room, North Hall, and East Room= The West Room, North Hall, and East Room occupy the center section of the north wall of the Executive Residence. When this area of the mansion was completed in 1809, a single large storeroom occupied this space. The western wall of the East Room was in place by 1825. Two small storerooms had also been created in what would later be the North Hall by constructing short, non-load bearing walls. These walls projected west, dividing the room into thirds. The North Hall as it exists today was created by 1865 when the storage partitions in the West Room were removed. The West Room served, at various times, as a bedroom for Willie Lincoln, President Andrew Johnson, Andrew Johnson Jr. (President Johnson's son), Robert and Charles Taft (sons of President Taft), Joseph P. Lash (a close friend of First lady Eleanor Roosevelt), Reathel Odum (private secretary First Lady Bess Truman), John F. Kennedy Jr.; and Chuck and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and their daughter. The room was converted into a playroom for First Daughter Amy Carter in 1977, and President Ronald Reagan had it set up as a fitness room. The North Hall was where President Abraham Lincoln stood as he delivered speeches to crowds on the North Lawn. It was used as a schoolroom for Fanny and Scott Hayes, youngest children of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This served as a maid's room during the two terms of President Theodore Roosevelt, as a bedroom for Maude Shaw (nursemaid for Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy, Jr.), and as a clothing storage space for first ladies Lady Bird Johnson and Nancy Reagan. The East Room's first documented use was as a bedroom for Frederick Dent (the father of First Lady Julia Grant). It later served as a bedroom for President Chester Arthur, Mary Dimmick (First Lady Caroline Harrison's niece and private secretary), John Witherspoon Scott (father of First Lady Caroline Harrison), Kermit Roosevelt, Madge Wallace (mother of First Lady Bess Truman), Caroline Kennedy, Pat and Luci Nugent (she was the daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson), Tricia Nixon, Susan Ford (daughter of President Gerald Ford), and Amy Carter. It was converted into an office for First Lady Nancy Reagan, but turned back into a bedroom for use by Chelsea Clinton (daughter of President Bill Clinton). Scott Hayes (young son of President Rutherford B. Hayes), Birchard Hayes (teenage son of President Rutherford B. Hayes), Irvin Garfield (young son of President James Garfield), Abram Garfield (young son of President James Garfield), also used either the West Room or East Room as a bedroom, but records are not clear which. Third Floor During a 1927 renovation the White House attic was rebuilt into a Third Floor. It was further expanded with the Truman Reconstruction and currently contains 20 rooms, nine bathrooms, and a main hall. This floor was once used for staff bedrooms, but no staff currently live in the White House. Jacqueline Kennedy extensively decorated these rooms with her favorite White House antiques, with her best known room being the \\"Empire Guest Room\\" (finished in First French Empire style). President Jimmy Carter had one room paneled with wood panels taken from an old family barn in Georgia. First Lady Hillary Clinton turned one of the rooms into a soundproof music room where President Bill Clinton could play his saxophone without disturbing others, turned a guest room into an exercise room, and created an \\"Eleanor Roosevelt Room\\" for her own use. When Marian Robinson moved to the White House alongside her daughter Michelle Obama's family in 2009, she took a bedroom and sitting area on the Third Floor as her private quarters. When Donald Trump became president, his and First Lady Melania Trump's son Barron took a bedroom on the Third Floor.An inside look at Donald Trump's home in Washington – Cheat Sheet.com Other notable features on the Third Floor include a sunroom with wet bar (atop the south portico), billiards room, and outdoor rooftop promenade. Visiting dignitaries are normally housed in the Second Floor state bedrooms and foreign heads of state and government customarily stay at Blair House.

He wrote the preface and drew the illustrations, which were based on Bokushi's originals. Some of the material in the book is of scientific interest. For example, it contains the first Japanese sketches of 86 types of natural snowflake crystals. An 1840 edition included an additional 97 sketches that Doi Toshitsura made with the aid of a microscope during his 20 years as daimyō of the Koga Domain. Thereafter, the snow crystal became a popular design motif on kimonos and on chawan, Japanese tea bowls.

It binds interferon-γ, the sole member of interferon type II.  Structure and function  The human interferon-gamma receptor complex consists the heterodimer of two chains: IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. In unstimulated cells, these subunits are not preassociated with each other but rather associate through their intracellular domains with inactive forms of specific Janus family kinases (Jak1 and Jak2). Jak1 and Jak2 constitutively associate with IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, respectively. Binding of IFN-γ to IFNGR1 induces the rapid dimerization of IFNGR1 chains, thereby forming a site that is recognized by the extracellular domain of IFNGR2. The ligand-induced assembly of the complete receptor complex contains two IFNGR1 and two IFNGR2 subunits, which bring into close juxtaposition the intracellular domains of these proteins together with the inactive Jak1 and Jak2 kinases that they associate with. In this complex, Jak1 and Jak2 transactivate one another and then phosphorylate IFNGR1, thereby forming a paired set of Stat1 docking sites on the ligated receptor. Two Stat1 molecules then associate with the paired docking sites, are brought into close proximity with receptor-associated- activated JAK kinases, and are activated by phosphorylation of the Stat1. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 molecules dissociate from their receptor tether and form homodimeric complexes. Activated Stat1 translocates to the nucleus and, after binding to a specific sequence in the promoter region of immediate- early IFN-γ-inducible genes, effects gene transcription.  Disease linkage  IFNGR1 deficiency is associated with the increased susceptibility to certain infectious diseases in patients, especially mycobacterial infections. = Mutations = Disseminated BCG infections occur in infants with SCID or with other severe T cell defects. However, in approximately half of the cases no specific host defect has been found. One possible explanation for this predilection was found in a 2.5-month-old Tunisian female infant who had fatal idiopathic disseminated BCG infection.Jouanguy E, Altare F, Lamhamedi S, et al. Interferon-gamma-receptor deficiency in an infant with fatal bacille Calmette-Guerin infection. N Engl J Med. 1996;335:1956–1961. In four children from Malta who had disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection in the absence of a recognized immunodeficiency.. Newport MJ, Huxley CM, Huston S, et al. A mutation in the interferon-gamma-receptor gene and susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. N Engl J Med. 1996;335:1941–1949. In the case of all five children, there was consanguinity in their pedigrees. All affected were found to have a functional defect in the upregulation of TNFα production by their blood macrophages in response to stimulation with IFNγ. Furthermore, all lacked expression of IFNγR's on their blood monocytes or lymphocytes, and each was found to have a mutation in the gene on chromosome 6q22-q23 that encodes IFNγR1. Of interest, these children did not appear to be susceptible to infection with agents other than mycobacteria. Th1 responses appeared to be normal in these patients. The susceptibility of these children to mycobacterial infections thus apparently results from an intrinsic impairment of the IFNγ pathway response to these particular intracellular pathogens, showing that IFNγ is obligatory for efficient macrophage antimycobacterial activity. Since the initial discoveries of IFNγR1-deficient humans, many more examples have been found, and IFNγR2-deficient individuals have been found as well.. Dorman SE, Holland SM.

First produced in 1951, the musical is based on Smith's autobiographical novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1943), but when Shirley Booth was cast as Aunt Cissy, a secondary character in the novel, the prominence of this role was expanded and tailored to Booth's comedic talents, diminishing the relative importance of other characters, in particular young Francie, through whose eyes the plot of the novel unfolds. Productions After two previews, the Broadway production, directed by Abbott and choreographed by Herbert Ross, opened on April 19, 1951, at the Alvin Theatre, where it ran for 267 performances. In addition to Booth, the cast included Johnny Johnston as Johnny, Marcia Van Dyke as Katie, and Nomi Mitty as Francie. Van Dyke was honored with a Theatre World Award. The musical director was Max Goberman.\\"Max Goberman\\" IBDB.

This fish is jawless with a small sucker mouth and a long, eel-like body. It is fairly small, only growing to about in length. The mountain brook lamprey is a non- parasitic lamprey, meaning that they do not attach themselves to larger species of fish. The mountain brook lamprey is believed to have evolved from the parasitic Ohio lamprey (I. bdellium) and occurs, often in abundance, within many of the tributaries of the Ohio and Tennessee River systems.Vladykov, V.D. & I. Kott. 1979. List of northern hemisphere lampreys (Petromyzonidae) and their distribution. Misc. Spec. Publ. 42, Dept. Fish. Oceans, Ottawa. All non-parasitic lampreys require two distinctly different habitats that are connected by free flowing (free of dams) stretches of streams. Adults are found in clear brooks with fast flowing water and either sand or gravel bottoms. Juveniles or ammocoetes are found in slow moving water buried in soft substrate of medium to large streams.http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Default.aspx?tabid=22726 As previously stated, the Mountain Brook lamprey is non parasitic and does not attach itself to other fish. In the larval stage before metamorphosis, the lampreys feed on detritus and algae, and after they complete metamorphosis, they obtain energy from stored fat reserves. The spawning season for lampreys is from late April to early May.http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/26031.html Geographic distribution The mountain brook lamprey has a fragmented range in the Mississippi basin with populations being found in New York, Pennsylvania and adjacent areas of Ohio. Mountain brook lamprey are also found in the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers in Tennessee, northern Alabama, Kentucky, and Virginia. In New York State, this lives in French Creek, and other northern and central parts of the Allegheny basin. The mountain brook lamprey is found in gravel riffles and sandy runs of clean, clear streams and in the sand, mud and debris in pools and backwaters. It spends its life in creeks without moving to larger rivers. Ecology The general view is that lampreys do not feed during metamorphosis with the loss of body energy reserves being countered by water uptake.Moore, J.W. & I.C. Potter. 1976. Aspects of feeding and lipid deposition and utilization in the lampreys, Lampetrafluviati-lis (L.) and Lumpetru planeri (Bloch). J. Anim. Ecol. 45: 699-712. Beamish, F.W.H., I.C. Potter & E. Thomas. 1979. Proximate composition of the adult anadromous sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, in relation to feeding, migration and reproduction. J. Anim. Ecol. 48: l-19. However, in the case of I. greeleyi, it is reasonable to assume metamorphosing animals do not feed but maintain body size by water uptake. This derives from measurements of oxygen consumption for ammocoetes of I. greeleyi (= I. hubbsi) by Hill and Potter (1970). Based on their measurements (9.5”C) and on energy concentration determined for I. gagei,Beamish & LeGrow 1983 the energy requirements for metamorphosis might be achieved without loss of body weight by increasing relative water content from 75 to 79-81%. Preliminary data indicate body water contents of 75.6 + 0.5 (n = 9), 76.22 0.7 (n = 14) and 76.8 + 0.9 (n = 13) for I. greeleyi in phases 1,3 and 4, respectively. By the completion of metamorphosis body water content increased to 79.4 rt 3.7% (n = 6), a value almost identical to that predicted from the earlier metabolic studies.Beamish, F.W.H., and Medland, T.E. 1987. Metamorphosis of the mountain brook lamprey Ichthyomyzon greeleyi. Environmental Biology of Fishes 23:45-54. Life history Spawning occurs in late May when the water temperature reaches . The males build nests just above riffles in about 1 foot of water, and just downstream from a flat stone in diameter. The male excavates the nest by removing small stones and pebbles, forming a depression about deep and in diameter with a fine gravel and sand bottom. Spawning occurs when a female moves over a nest and attaches to a rock. Spawning pairs stimulate other pairs to begin spawning. The mountain brook lamprey lives up to five or six years, and usually dies after spawning. The post-embryonic life cycle of all lampreys includes a distinct larval or ammocoete and adult period. A juvenile period prior to the adult period is present in parasitic lampreys, but is absent in the nonparasitic or brook lampreys.Hardisty and Potter, 1971a,b. The sedentary and phytophagous larval period of all lampreys is spent in the sandy silt substratum of cool streams.Moore and Mallatt, 1980. Coloration of live mountain brook lamprey did not change between the ammocoete and senescent periods and ranged from butterscotch to olive brown. The dorsal surface was generally darker than the lateral and ventral surfaces. Scattered dark pigment spots are present along the length of the dorsal-lateral surface. Metamorphosis commenced between early and mid-August. Time required for metamorphosis of the populations of mountain brook lamprey in Bent Creek, Cane Creek and Davidson River is estimated at 100–140 days. Management Globally the status of I. greeleyi is \\"Apparently secure\\". Further, the short-term trend for the species complies with the stability of the species. However, in the long-term, there has been a 30-70% decline and some extirpation.NatureServe. 2007. NatureServe Explorer: An online encyclopedia of life. Version 6.2. NatureServe, Arlintion, Virginia. In 10 states I. greeleyi is considered vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled. The major cause of this decline is habitat destruction due to dams, pollution, and siltation.http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/factsheet/11248.pdf References Ichthyomyzon Fish described in 1937 ","title":"Mountain brook lamprey"},{"id":"9753135","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump with the Saudi Arabia Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the White House, March 2017. Saudi Arabia–United States relations refers to the bilateral relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States of America, which began in 1933 when full diplomatic relations were established and became formalized in the 1951 Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement. Despite the differences between the two countries—an ultraconservative Islamic absolute monarchy, and a secular constitutional republic—the two countries have been allies. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi Royal Family. Ever since the modern USSaudi relationship began in 1945, the United States has been willing to overlook many of the kingdom's more controversial aspects as long as it maintained oil production and supported U.S. national security policies. Since World War II, the two countries have been allied in opposition to Communism, in support of stable oil prices, stability in the oil fields and oil shipping of the Persian Gulf, and stability in the economies of Western countries where Saudis have invested. In particular the two countries were allies against the Soviets in Afghanistan and in the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait in 1991. The two countries have been in disagreement with regard to the State of Israel, as well as the embargo of the U.S. and its allies by Saudi Arabia and other Middle East oil exporters during the 1973 oil crisis (which raised oil prices considerably), the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq (which Saudi Arabia opposed), aspects of the \\"War on Terror\\", and what many in the U.S. see as the pernicious influence of Saudi Arabia after the September 11 attacks. In recent years, particularly the Barack Obama administration, the relationship between the two countries became strained and witnessed major decline. However, the relationship was strengthened by President Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, which was his first overseas trip after becoming President of the United States. The October 2018 assassination of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Turkey caused a serious rift between the countries. The United States sanctioned some Saudi nationals and Congress unsucessfully attempted to cut off U.S. weapons sales to Saudi related to the war in Yemen. Turkish authorities and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the killing was done on the order of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia subsidized its oil exports to the U.S. until President George W. Bush proposed the overthrow of the Iraqi government in 2002. The shale oil boom enabled the United States to become a net exporter of petroleum products in 2019, making the U.S. economy significantly less dependent on Saudi oil. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia remain an important U.S. export. The U.S. Department of Defense acts an intermediary charging 7% of such sales, allowing it to fund training activities in other countries such as Bolivia. Despite the strong relationship between the two countries, opinion polls between the two nations show negative feelings between the American people and Saudi people in recent years, particularly American feelings towards the desert kingdom. Most American criticism pertains to lack of human rights in Saudi Arabia. A poll of Saudis by Zogby International (2002) and BBC (between October 2005 and January 2006) found 51% of Saudis had hostile feelings towards the American people in 2002; in 2005–2006, Saudi public opinion was sharply divided with 38% viewing U.S. influence positively and 38% viewing U.S. influence negatively. As of 2019, Saudi Arabian students form the 4th largest group of international students studying in the United States, representing 3.4% of all foreigners pursuing higher education in the US. A December 2013 poll found 57% of Americans polled had an unfavorable view of Saudi Arabia and 27% favorable. History =Early history (recognition)= Although King Abdulaziz Al Saud, Ibn Saud as an appellation, the founder of Saudi Arabia in 1901, had an excellent relationship with the British who defended Saudi Arabia from the Turks, he eventually developed even closer ties with the United States. After unifying his country, on September 28, 1928, Bin Saud set about gaining international recognition for Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom was the first country to recognize Saudi Arabia as an independent state, as the British had provided protection of Saudi territories from the Turks for many years. Saud also hoped to be recognized by the US, which at that time had no interest in Saudi Arabia. Initially, his efforts were rebuffed, but Washington eventually came around, promoted by the fact that Al Saud had obtained recognition from many nations. In May 1931 the U.S. officially recognized Saudi Arabia by extending full diplomatic recognition. At the same time Ibn Saud granted a concession to the U.S. company, Standard Oil of California, allowing them to explore for oil in the country's Eastern Province, al-Hasa. The company gave the Saudi government £35,000 and also paid assorted rental fees and royalty payments. In November 1931, a treaty was signed by both nations which included favored nation status. The relationship was still weak, however, as America did not have an interest in establishing missions in Saudi Arabia: at the time, Saudi affairs were handled by the U.S. delegation in Cairo, Egypt, and did not send a resident ambassador to the country until 1943. The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America was economically strengthened in 1933, when Standard Oil of California was given a concession to explore the Saudi Arabian lands for oil. The subsidiary of this company, regarded as California Arabian Standard Oil Company, later dubbed Saudi Aramco carries out a fruitful exploration in 1938, finding oil for the first time. The relationship between the two nations strengthened throughout the next decade, establishing a full diplomatic relationship through a symbolic acceptance of an American envoy in Saudi Arabia. =World War II= King Ibn Saud converses with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on board the USS Quincy, after the Yalta Conference in 1945. As the U.S.–Saudi relationship was growing slowly, World War II was beginning its first phase, with Saudi Arabia remaining neutral. The U.S. was deeply involved in World War II, and as a result, US-Saudi relations were put on the 'back burner'. This negligence left Saudi Arabia vulnerable to attack. Italy, an Axis power, bombed a CASOC oil installation in Dhahran crippling Saudi Arabia's oil production. This attack left Bin Saud scrambling for to find an external power that would protect the country, fearing further attacks that would most likely cease the country's oil production and the flow of pilgrims coming into Makkah to perform Hajj, the base of the Saudi power and economy at that time. CASOC Struck oil near Dhahran, but production over the next several years remained low—only about 42.5 million barrels between 1941 and 1945; less than 1% of the output in the United States over the same time period. CASOC was later renamed the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco). However, as World War II progressed, the United States began to believe that Saudi oil was of strategic importance. As a result, in the interest of national security, the U.S. began to push for greater control over the CASOC concession. On 16 February 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that \\"the defense of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defense of the United States\\", thereby making possible the extension of the Lend-Lease program to the kingdom. Later that year, the president approved the creation of the state-owned Petroleum Reserves Corporation, with the intent that it purchase all the stock of CASOC and thus gain control of Saudi oil reserves in the region. However, the plan was met with opposition and ultimately failed. Roosevelt continued to court the government, however—on 14 February 1945, he met with King Ibn Saud aboard the USS Quincy, discussing topics such as the countries' security relationship and the creation of a Jewish country in the Mandate of Palestine. Bin Saud approved the US's request to allow the U.S. air force to fly over and construct airfields in Saudi Arabia. The oil installations were rebuilt and protected by the U.S., the pilgrims' routes were protected, and the U.S. gained a much needed direct route for military aircraft heading to Iran and the Soviet Union. The first American consulate was opened in Dhahran in 1944. =After World War II= In 1945, after World War II, Saudi citizens began to feel uncomfortable with U.S. forces still operating in Dhahran. In contrast, Saudi government and officials saw the U.S. forces as a major component of the Saudi military defense strategy. As a result, Bin Saud balanced the two conflicts by increasing the demands on U.S. forces in Dhahran when the region was highly threatened and lowering it when the danger declined. At this time, due to the start of the Cold War, the U.S. was greatly concerned about Soviet communism and devised a strategy of 'containing' the spread of communism within Arabian Peninsula, putting Saudi security at the top of Washington's list of priorities. Harry S. Truman's administration also promised Bin Saud that he would protect Saudi Arabia from Soviet influence. Therefore, the U.S. increased its presence in the region to protect its interest and its allies. The security relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. was therefore greatly strengthened at the start of the 'cold war'. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon with their host, King Saud of Saudi Arabia, at the Mayflower Hotel in 1957 =Foundation of ARAMCO= The United States of America and Saudi Arabian trade relationship has long revolved around two central concepts: security and oil. Throughout the next two decades, the 50s and 60s, relations between the two nations grew significantly stronger. In 1950, ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia agreed on a 50/50 profit distribution of the oil discovered in Saudi Arabia. In 1951 the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement was put into action, which allowed for the US arms trade to Saudi Arabia, along with a United States military training mission to be centered in the Saudi Land. =King Saud comes to power (1953)= King Saud and John Kennedy meet at the king's mansion in Palm Beach, Florida in 1962 In the late 1950s, King Saud, the eldest son of King Abdulaziz, came to power after his father's death. During Saud's time the U.S.–Saudi relations had faced many obstacles concerning the anti-communism strategy. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's new anti-Soviet alliance combined most of \\"the kingdom's regional rivals and foes\\", which heightened Saudi suspicions. For this reason, in October 1955, Saud had joined the pro-Soviet strategy with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Furthermore, Saud dismissed the U.S. forces and replaced them by Egyptian forces. Thus, this act had sparked and innovated a new and a large conflict in the relationship. But in 1956, during the Suez crisis, Saud began to cooperate with the U.S. again after Eisenhower's opposition of the Israeli, British, and French plan to seize the canal. Eisenhower opposed the plan because of anti-Soviet purposes, but King Saud had admired the act and decided to start cooperating with the U.S. As a result, Egyptian power greatly declined while US-Saudi relations were simultaneously improving. =Cold War and Soviet containment= In 1957, Saud decided to renew the U.S. base in Dhahran. In less than a year, after the Egyptian–Syrian unification in 1958, Egypt's pro-Soviet strategy had returned to power. Saud had once again joined their alliance, which declined the US- Saudi relationship to a fairly low point especially after he announced in 1961 that he changed his mind on renewing the U.S. base. In 1962, however, Egypt attacked Saudi Arabia from bases in Yemen during the 1962 Yemeni revolution because of Saudi Arabia's Anti-revolution propaganda, which made Saud seek the U.S. support. President John F. Kennedy immediately responded to Saud's request by sending U.S. warplanes in July 1963 to the war zone to stop the attack which was putting U.S. interests at risk. At the end of the war, shortly before Prince Faisal became king, the relationship rebuilt itself to become healthy again. As the United Kingdom withdrew from the Persian Gulf region in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. was reluctant to take on new security commitments. Instead, the Nixon administration sought to rely on local allies to \\"police\\" American interests (see Nixon Doctrine). In the Persian Gulf region, this meant relying on Saudi Arabia and Iran as \\"twin pillars\\" of regional security. Whereas in 1970 the U.S. provided less than $16 million to Saudi Arabia in military aid, that number increased to $312 million by 1972. As part of the \\"twin pillars\\" strategy, the U.S. also attempted to improve relations between the Saudis and the Iranians, such as by persuading Iran to remove its territorial claim to Bahrain. =Oil embargo and energy crises= In November 1964, Faisal became the new king after the conflicts he had with his brother Saud, the erstwhile king. The US, on the other hand, was not sure about the outcome of such unplanned change in the Saudi monarchy. Faisal, however, continued the cooperation with the US until October 20, 1973. Then came the low point of the relationship before 9/11, as Faisal decided to contribute in an oil embargo against the US and Europe in favor of the Arab position during the Yom Kippur War. That caused an energy crisis in the US. \\"America's complete Israel support against the Arabs makes it extremely difficult for us to continue to supply the United States with oil, or even remain friends with the United States,\\" said Faisal in an interview with international media. Despite the tensions caused by the oil embargo, the U.S. wished to resume relations with the Saudis. Indeed, the great oil wealth accumulated as a result of price increases allowed the Saudis to purchase large sums of American military technology. The embargo was lifted in March 1974 after the U.S. pressured Israel into negotiating with Syria over the Golan Heights. Three months later, \\"Washington and Riyadh signed a wide- ranging agreement on expanded economic and military cooperation.\\" In the 1975 fiscal year, the two countries signed $2 billion worth of military contracts, including an agreement to send Saudi Arabia 60 fighter jets. The Saudis also argued (partially on behalf of American desires) to keep OPEC price increases in the mid-1970s lower than Iraq and Iran initially wanted. The Saudis' increase of oil production to stabilize the oil price and the support of anti- communism have all contributed to closer relations with the U.S. In January 1979, the U.S. sent F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia for further protection from communism. Furthermore, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were both supporting anti- communist groups in Afghanistan and struggling countries, one of those groups later became known as the Al-Qaida terrorist organization. Fahd with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Ivana and Donald Trump in 1985. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia supplied money and arms to the anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan. =Government purchases= After the Cold War, U.S.–Saudi relations were improving. The U.S. and U.S. companies were actively engaged and paid handsomely for preparing and administrating the rebuilding of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia transferred $100 billion to the United States for administration, construction, weapons, and in the 1970s and 1980s higher education scholarships to the U.S. During that era the U.S. built and administrated numerous military academies, navy ports, and Air Force military airbases. Many of these military facilities were influenced by the U.S., with the needs of cold war aircraft and deployment strategies in mind. Also, the Saudis purchased a great deal of weapons that varied from F-15 war planes to M1 Abrams main battle tanks that later proved useful during the Gulf War. The U.S. pursued a policy of building up and training the Saudi military as a counterweight to Shiite extremism and revolution following the revolution in Iran. The U.S. provided top of the line equipment and training, and consulted the Saudi government frequently, acknowledging them as the most important Islamic leader in that part of the world, and a key player in the U.S. security strategy. =The Gulf War= Relations between the two nations solidified even further past the point of the oil embargo, whereas the United States of America sent nearly 500,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia in attempt to aid in protection against Iraq. Following Operation Desert Shield, which was a response by President George H. W. Bush to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, America kept 5,000 troops in Saudi Arabia in order to maintain their protection and trade relations. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to the Gulf War, during which the security relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia was greatly strengthened. Concurrently with the US invasion, King Fahd declared war against Iraq. The U.S. was concerned about the safety of Saudi Arabia against Saddam's intention to invade and control the oil reserves in the region. As a result, after King Fahd's approval, President Bush deployed a significant amount of American military forces (up to 543,000 ground troops by the end of the operation) to protect Saudi Arabia from a possible Iraqi invasion; this operation was called Desert Shield. Furthermore, the U.S. sent additional troops in operation Desert Storm with nearly 100,000 Saudi troops sent by Fahad to form a US-Saudi army alliance, along with troops from other allied countries, to attack Iraqi troops in Kuwait and to stop further invasion. During Operation Desert Storm Iraqi troops were defeated within four days, causing the Iraqis to retreat back to Iraq. =Operation Southern Watch= U.S. President George W. Bush and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Crawford, Texas, 25 April 2002 Since the Gulf War, the U.S. had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabia—a figure that rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq. Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991, and the country's oil exports through the shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf are protected by the US Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. The continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia was one of the stated motivations behind the September 11 attacks, as well as the Khobar Towers bombing. In 2003, the U.S. withdrew most of its troops from Saudi Arabia, though one unit still remains. =2010 U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia= Former Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud in the White House. On October 20, 2010, U.S. State Department notified Congress of its intention to make the biggest arms sale in American history—an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. The U.S. was keen to point out that the arms transfer would increase \\"interoperability\\" with U.S. forces. In the 1990–1991 Gulf War, having U.S.-trained Saudi forces, along with military installations built to U.S. specifications, allowed the American armed forces to deploy in a comfortable and familiar battle environment. This new deal would increase these capabilities, as an advanced American military infrastructure is about to be built. =Foreign policy= Upon becoming regent in 2005, King Abdullah's first foreign trip was to China. In 2012, a Saudi–Chinese agreement to cooperate in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes was signed. Abdullah also welcomed Russian president Vladimir Putin to Riyadh in 2007, awarding him the kingdom's highest honor, the King Abdul Aziz Medal. Russia and Saudi Arabia concluded a joint venture between Saudi ARAMCO and LUKOIL to develop new Saudi gas fields. =2013 rift= Prince Mohammad bin Salman with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 13 June 2016 Alwaleed bin Talal warned several Saudi ministers in May 2013 that shale gas production in the U.S. would eventually pose a threat to the kingdom's oil- dependent economy. Despite this, the two countries still maintained a positive relationship. In October 2013, Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan suggested a distancing of Saudi Arabia–United States relations as a result of differences between the two countries over the Syrian civil war and diplomatic overtures between Iran and the Obama administration. The Saudis rejected a rotating seat on the UN Security Council that month (despite previously campaigning for such a seat), in protest of American policy over those issues. Saudi Arabia was cautiously supportive of a Western-negotiated interim agreement with Iran over its nuclear program. President Obama called King Abdullah to brief him about the agreement, and the White House said the leaders agreed to \\"consult regularly\\" about the U.S.'s negotiations with Iran. =Khashoggi assassination= In October 2018, the Jamal Khashoggi case put the US into a difficult situation as Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, share a strong personal and official bond with Mohammad bin Salman. During an interview, Trump vowed to get to the bottom of the case and that there would be \\"severe punishment\\" if the Saudi kingdom is found to be involved in the disappearance or assassination of the journalist. A vexed reply came from the Saudi Foreign Ministry saying if Saudi Arabia \\"receives any action, it will respond with greater action,\\" citing the oil-rich kingdom's \\"influential and vital role in the global economy.\\" After weeks of denial, Saudi Arabia accepted that Khashoggi died at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul during a \\"fistfight.\\" Adel al-Jubeir described the journalist's death as a \\"murder\\" and a \\"tremendous mistake.\\" But he denied the knowledge of whereabouts of the body. Following the case, the US promised to revoke the visas of Saudi nationals responsible for Khashoggi's death. In November 2018, Trump defended Saudi Arabia, despite the country's involvement in the killing of Khashoggi. Experts said it is impossible for Mohammad bin Salman to visit Washington or have a direct relationship with the Trump administration. However, in November 2018, relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia re-strengthened when Trump nominated John Abizaid, a retired US army general who spoke Arabic as US ambassador to the country. Saudi Arabia also brought a fresh face on board, appointing their first female ambassador, Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, to help calm relations in the wake of Khashoggi's death. On 12 December 2018, United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations approved a resolution to suspend Yemen conflict-related sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia and impose sanctions on people obstructing humanitarian access in Yemen. Senator Lindsey Graham said, \\"This sends a global message that just because you're an ally of the United States, you can't kill with impunity. The relationship with Saudi Arabia is not working for America. It is more of a burden than an asset.\\" On 8 April 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that 16 Saudi nationals involved in Khashoggi's murder, including Mohammed bin Salman's close aid Saud al-Qahtani, have been barred from entering the US. Controversies Saudi-led war on Yemen were led away handcuffed by New York police outside the U.S. mission to the UN on 11 December 2017 =First conflict= While the U.S.–Saudi relationship was growing, their first conflict began when the disorder broke between the Jews and Arabs in April 1936 in the British-administrated Palestine mandate. The U.S. favored the establishment of an independent Israeli state, but Saudi Arabia on the other hand, the leading nation in the Islamic and Arab world were supporting the Arab position which sparked up their first conflict. In other words, the U.S. oil interest in Saudi Arabia could be held hostage depending on the circumstances of the conflict. U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt sent the king a letter indicating that it is true that the U.S. supports the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, but it is not in any way responsible for the establishment. Bin Saud was convinced by the message that the U.S.–Saudi relations had begun to run smooth again. Moreover, in March 1938, CASCO made a big oil discovery in Saudi Arabia booming the oil industry in the country and coincidentally the U.S. became more interested in Saudi oil. As a result, on February 4, 1940, as the World War II was approaching, the U.S. had established a diplomatic presence in Saudi Arabia to have closer relations with the Saudis and to protect it from enemy hand; Bert Fish, former ambassador in Egypt was elected as the U.S. ambassador in Jeddah. =Petrodollar power= U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his advisor Ahmad Asiri in 2016 The United States dollar is the de facto world currency. The petrodollar system originated in the early 1970s in the wake of the Bretton Woods collapse. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, feared that the abandonment of the international gold standard under the Bretton Woods arrangement (combined with a growing US trade deficit, and massive debt associated with the ongoing Vietnam War) would cause a decline in the relative global demand of the U.S. dollar. In a series of meetings, the United States and the Saudi royal family made an agreement. The United States would offer military protection for Saudi Arabia's oil fields, and in return the Saudi's would price their oil sales exclusively in United States dollars (in other words, the Saudis were to refuse all other currencies, except the U.S. dollar, as payment for their oil exports). =September 11 attacks= On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. and in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania by four hijacked airplanes killed 2,977 victims and cost an estimated $150 billion in property and infrastructure damage and economic impact, exceeding the death toll and damage caused by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 60 years earlier. 15 of the 19 hijackers in the attacks came from Saudi Arabia, as did the leader of the hijackers' organization, (Osama bin Laden). In the U.S., there followed considerable negative publicity for, and scrutiny of, Saudi Arabia and its teaching of Islam, and a reassessing of the \\"oil-for-security\\" alliance with the Al Saud. A 2002 Council on Foreign Relations Terrorist Financing Task Force report found that \\"for years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have been the most important source of funds for al-Qaeda. And for years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this problem.\\" In the backlash against Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism, the Saudi government was portrayed in the media, Senate hearings, and elsewhere as > a sort of oily heart of darkness, the wellspring of a bleak, hostile value > system that is the very antithesis of our own. America's seventy-year > alliance with the kingdom has been reappraised as a ghastly mistake, a > selling of the soul, a gas-addicted alliance with death. There was even a proposal at the Defense Policy Board, (an arm of Department of Defense) to consider 'taking Saudi out of Arabia' by forcibly seizing control of the oil fields, giving the Hijaz back to the Hashemites, and delegating control of Medina and Mecca to a multinational committee of moderate, non-Wahhabi Muslims. In Saudi Arabia itself, anti-American sentiment was described as \\"intense\\" and \\"at an all-time high\\". A survey taken by the Saudi intelligence service of \\"educated Saudis between the ages of 25 and 41\\" taken shortly after the 9/11 attacks \\"concluded that 95 percent\\" of those surveyed supported Bin Laden's cause. (Support for Bin Laden reportedly waned by 2006 and by then, the Saudi population become considerably more pro- American, after Al-Qaeda linked groups staged attacks inside Saudi Arabia.) The proposal at the Defense Policy Board to 'take Saudi out of Arabia' was spread as the secret US plan for the kingdom. In October 2001, The Wall Street Journal reported that Crown Prince Abdullah sent a critical letter to U.S. President George W. Bush on August 29: \\"A time comes when peoples and nations part. We are at a crossroads. It is time for the United States and Saudi Arabia to look at their separate interests. Those governments that don't feel the pulse of their people and respond to it will suffer the fate of the Shah of Iran.\\" Visa page from Saeed al-Ghamdi's Kingdom of Saudi Arabia passport recovered from the United Airlines Flight 93 crash site For over a year after 9/11 Saudi Minister of the Interior (a powerful post whose jurisdiction included domestic intelligence gathering), Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, insisted that the Saudi hijackers were dupes in a Zionist plot. In December 2002, a Saudi government spokesman declared that his country was the victim of unwarranted American intolerance bordering on hate. In 2003, several terror attacks targeted U.S. compounds, the Saudi ministry of interior, and several other places occurred inside Saudi Arabia. As a result of these attacks, the U.S. decided to redevelop Saudi law enforcement agencies by providing them with anti-terrorism education, the latest technologies, and by giving them a chance to interact with U.S. law enforcement agencies to gain efficient knowledge and power needed to handle terrorist cases and to enforce anti- terrorist laws. American politicians and media have accused the Saudi government of supporting terrorism and tolerating a jihadist culture, noting that Osama bin Laden and fifteen out of the nineteen (or 78 percent of) 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. September 11 terrorists were Saudi Arabia nationals Although some analysts have speculated that Osama bin Laden, who in 1994 had his Saudi nationality revoked and expelled from Saudi Arabia, had chosen 15 Saudi hijackers on purpose to break up the U.S.–Saudi relations, as the U.S. was still suspicious of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi's decided to cooperate with the U.S. on the war on terror. \\"Terrorism does not belong to any culture, or religion, or political system\\", said King Abdullah as the opening address of the Counter-terrorism International Conference (CTIC) held in Riyadh in 2005. The cooperation grew broader covering financial, educational, technological aspects both in Saudi Arabia and Muslim-like countries to prevent pro-Al-Qaeda terrorists' activities and ideologies. \\"It is a high time for the Ulma (Muslim Scholars), and all thinkers, intellectuals, and academics, to shoulder their responsibilities towards the enlightenment of the people, especially the young people, and protect them from deviant ideas\\" said Sheikh Saleh bin Abdulaziz Alsheikh, Minister of Islamic Affairs, in the CTIC. Almost all members of the CTIC agreed that Al- Qaeda target less educated Muslims by convincing them that they are warriors of God, but they really convince them to only accomplish their political goals. Three years after the Saudi Serious and active role on anti-terrorist, Al-Qaeda began launching multiple attacks targeting Saudi government buildings and U.S. compounds in Saudi grounds. Their attacks exhibit their revenge against Saudi Arabia's cooperation with the U.S. trying to stop further US–Saudi anti-terrorist movements and trying to corrode the US-Saudi relationship and to annihilate it. After these changes, the Saudi government was more equipped in preventing terrorist activities. They caught a large number of Saudi terrorists and terrorists from other countries (some of them American) that had connections with al-Qaeda in one way or another. Some of these criminals held high rank in terrorist society, which helped diffuse many terrorist cells. In a matter of months, Saudi law enforcement officials were successfully able to stop and prevent terrorist activities. Also, they were successful in finding the source of terrorist financing. In March 2018, a US judge formally allowed a suit to move forward against Saudi Arabia government brought by 9/11 survivors and victim's families. =Child abduction= The international abduction of American children to Saudi Arabia provoked sustained criticism and resulted in a Congressional hearing in 2002 where parents of children held in Saudi Arabia gave impassioned testimony related to the abduction of their children. Washington-based Insight ran a series of articles on international abduction during the same period highlighting Saudi Arabia a number of times. =Allegations of funding terrorism= According to a 2009 U.S. State Department communication by Hillary Clinton, United States Secretary of State, (disclosed as part of the Wikileaks U.S. 'cables leaks' controversy in 2010) \\"donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide\\". Part of this funding arises through the zakat (an act of charity dictated by Islam) paid by all Saudis to charities, and amounting to at least 2.5% of their income. Although many charities are genuine, others allegedly serve as fronts for money laundering and terrorist financing operations. While many Saudis contribute to those charities in good faith believing their money goes toward good causes, it has been alleged that others know full well the terrorist purposes to which their money will be applied. In September 2016, the Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act that would allow relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for its government's alleged role in the attacks. Saudi Arabia was involved in the CIA-led Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels. Some American officials worried that Syrian rebels being supported had ties to al-Qaeda. In October 2015, Saudi Arabia delivered 500 U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles to anti-Assad rebels. Reports indicate that some TOW missiles have ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda in Syria and the Islamic State. = 2017 arms deal and war in Yemen = Protest against U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, March 2018 Significant numbers of Americans have criticized the conduct of Saudi Arabia in its ongoing intervention in the Yemeni Civil War, including alleged war crimes such as bombing of hospitals, gas stations, water infrastructure, marketplaces and other groups of civilians, and archaeological monuments; declaring the entire Saada Governorate a military target; use of cluster bombs; and enforcing a blockade of food and medical supplies that has triggered a famine. Critics oppose U.S. support of Saudi Arabia for this operation, which they say does not benefit the national security interests of the United States, and they object to the United States selling arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen. The approval of the 2017 arms deal was opposed by various lawmakers, including GOP Senators Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Todd Young and Dean Heller along with most Democrat Senators who voted to advance the measure in order to block the sale, citing the human rights violations by Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni Civil War. Among the senators who voted against moving the measure to block the sale were Democratic Senators Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson, Joe Manchin and Mark Warner along with top Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker and John McCain. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic Representative from Hawaii, criticized the move, saying that Saudi Arabia is \\"a country with a devastating record of human rights violations at home and abroad, and a long history of providing support to terrorist organizations that threaten the American people\\". Rand Paul introduced a bill to try to block the plan calling it a \\"travesty\\". U.S. Senator Chris Murphy accused the United States of complicity in Yemen's humanitarian crisis, saying: \\"Thousands and thousands inside Yemen today are dying. ... This horror is caused in part by our decision to facilitate a bombing campaign that is murdering children and to endorse a Saudi strategy inside Yemen that is deliberately using disease and starvation and the withdrawal of humanitarian support as a tactic.\\" =Khashoggi killing= Jamal Khashoggi (left) at a 2018 Project on Middle East Democracy forum in Washington, D.C. In October 2018, serious allegations were put on Saudi for murdering a Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Saudi Arabia to \\"support a thorough investigation\\" regarding the disappearance and \\"to be transparent about the results.\\" Trump said, \\"We cannot let this happen to reporters, to anybody. We're demanding everything. We want to see what's going on there.\\" Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican senator's reaction was stern, as he said \\"there would be hell to pay\\" if Saudi is involved in the murder of Khashoggi. He further added, \\"If they're this brazen it shows contempt. Contempt for everything we stand for, contempt for the relationship.\\" =Freedom of religion= Ambassador at Large Sam Brownback condemned the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its religious freedom abuses, on the release of 2018 Report on International Religious Freedom by the State Department. Brownback called Saudi as \\"one of the worst actors in the world on religious persecution\\" and hoped to see “actions take place in a positive direction”. The report details discrimination against and maltreatment of Shiite Muslims in Saudi Arabia that includes the mass execution of 34 individuals in April 2019, out of which a majority were Shiite Muslims. =2019 arms legislation= In the wake of a declining human rights record, on 17 July 2019, lawmakers in Washington backed a resolution to block the sale of precision-guided munitions to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The measure would have denied billions of dollars of weapon sale to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen where thousands have been killed in the 4-year long war. President Trump vetoed three such resolutions, and there was not a two-thirds majority in the Senate to override.US Senate allows arms sales to Saudi Arabia, sustaining Trump vetoes On 3 August 2020, Democrats in Congress issued subpoenas in probe of the US Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Democrats demanded the State Department officials to testify as part of investigation of 2019 arms sale and the dismissal of the State Department’s inspector general, Steve Linick, by President Donald Trump in May on Pompeo’s advice. On 11 August 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was cleared of charges of wrongdoing in a disputed arms sale to Saudi Arabia and UAE. Mike Pompeo was accused of abuse of power after he used an obscure emergency procedure to bypass congressional refusal to approve an $8 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in May 2019. = 2016 U.S. presidential election = In August 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with an envoy representing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The envoy offered help to the Trump presidential campaign, which would be illegal under U.S. law. The meeting included Lebanese-American lobbyist George Nader, Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia. Lebanese- American businessman Ahmad Khawaja claimed that Saudi Arabia and UAE illegally funnelled millions of dollars into the Trump's campaign. In April 2017, U.S. President Donald J. Trump attempted to repair the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia by having the US Defense Secretary visit Saudi Arabia. Trump has stated that he aims to help and assist Saudi Arabia in terms of military protection in order to receive beneficial economic compensation for the United States in return. = Pensacola shooting = On December 6, 2019, an aviation student from Saudi Arabia Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani shot three people dead and injured eight others at US Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. This attack is concluded as a terrorist attack by FBI following the investigation. Alshamrani himself is a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force who was participating in a training program sponsored by the Pentagon as part of a security cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia. Later, the Navy suspended flight training for all Saudi military aviation students pending the results of the FBI investigation.https://www.foxnews.com/us/saudis-arrested- questioning-pensacola-shooting.amp Florida governor Ron DeSantis placed a large amount of blame and need for compensation on the Saudi government, stating \\"They [Saudi Arabia] are going to owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.\\" = Coronavirus outbreak = On 3 July, 2020, it was reported that dozens of American diplomats will be leaving Saudi Arabia, along with their families due to the kingdom's failure at containing the coronavirus outbreak, even as its economy reopens. Some of the diplomats believe that the government of Saudi Arabia may be underreporting the number of coronavirus cases by thousands. Post-9/11 relationship U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry with King Salman of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, 25 August 2016 Saudi Arabia engaged the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Patton Boggs as registered foreign agents in the wake of the public relations disaster when knowledge of the identities of suspected hijackers became known. They also hired the PR and lobbying firm Qorvis for $14 million a year. Qorvis engaged in a PR frenzy that publicized the \\"9/11 Commission finding that there was 'no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded [Al Qaeda]'—while omitting the report's conclusion that 'Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism.'\\" According to at least one journalist (John R. Bradley), the ruling Saudi family was caught between depending for military defense on the United States, while also depending for domestic support on the Wahhabi religious establishment, which as a matter of religious doctrine \\"ultimately seeks the West's destruction\\", including that of its ruler's purported ally—the US. During the Iraq War, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, criticized the U.S.-led invasion as a \\"colonial adventure\\" aimed only at gaining control of Iraq's natural resources. But at the same time, Bradley writes, the Saudi government secretly allowed the US military to \\"essentially\\" manage its air campaign and launch special operations against Iraq from inside Saudi borders, using \\"at least three\\" Saudi air bases. The two nations cooperate and share information about al-Qaeda and leaders from both countries continue to meet to discuss their mutual interests and bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are strategic allies, and since President Obama took office in 2009, the U.S. has sold $110 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. The National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 began cooperating with the Saudi Ministry of Interior in an effort to help ensure \\"regime continuity\\". An April 2013 top secret memo shows the agency's program of providing \\"direct analytic and technical support\\" to the Saudis on \\"internal security\\" matters. The CIA had already been gathering intelligence for the regime long before. In January 2015, after the death of King Abdullah, the White House and President Obama praised him as a leader and mentioned \\"the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a force for stability and security in the Middle East and beyond.\\" naval blockade of Yemen. In March 2015, President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \\"Joint Planning Cell\\" with Saudi Arabia. U.S. government lawyers have considered whether the United States is legally a \\"co-belligerent\\" in the conflict. Such a finding would oblige the U.S. to investigate allegations of war crimes by the Saudi coalition, and U.S. military personnel could be subject to prosecution. American journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote in October 2016: \\"From the start of the hideous Saudi bombing campaign against Yemen 18 months ago, two countries have played active, vital roles in enabling the carnage: the U.S. and U.K. The atrocities committed by the Saudis would have been impossible without their steadfast, aggressive support.\\" In September 2016, Senators Rand Paul and Chris Murphy worked to prevent the proposed sale of $1.15 billion in arms from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Senate voted 71 to 27 against the Murphy–Paul resolution to block the U.S.–Saudi arms deal. While the trade based relationship between the United States of America and Saudi Arabia is one that is vastly affected by political disagreements and positions, the trade has yet to cease since its conception. Relations between the two nations have never come to a complete halt throughout history due to the economic advantages both nations gain from one another. Statistically, the trade balance, using 2016 as a benchmark year, has declined to a deficit of 2.5 billion dollars over the 2017 year, popular opinion is that this exemplifies strong future relations between the two nations through the political and militaristic common grounds the United States has been developing with Saudi Arabia. Many experts believe the United States of America and Saudi Arabia are almost 'perfect' for trade due to oil being an essential commodity to the American people and the overall economy of the United States. In January 2017, U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis \\"reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Saudi Arabia strategic relationship\\". Mattis has voiced support for a Saudi Arabian-led military campaign against Yemen's Shiite rebels. He asked the President to remove restrictions on U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia. On 10 February 2017, CIA director Mike Pompeo awarded the Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef with the CIA's \\"George Tenet\\" Medal.  Trade relations  = Energy and oil = Saudi Arabia has been an enticing trade partner with the United States from the early 20th century. The biggest commodity traded between the two nations is oil. The strength of the relationship is notoriously attributed to the United States' demand on oil throughout the post modern era, approximately 10,000 barrels of petroleum are imported daily to United States since 2012 (\\"U.S. Total Crude Oil and Products Imports\\"). Saudi Arabia has consistently been in need of weapons, reinforcement, and arms due to the consistent rising tensions throughout the Middle East during the late 20th century and early 21st century. Post 2016, the United States of America has continued to trade with Saudi Arabia mainly for their oil related goods. The top exports of Saudi Arabia are Crude Petroleum ($96.1B), Refined Petroleum ($13B), Ethylene Polymers($10.1B), Propylene Polymers ($4.93B) and Ethers ($3.6B), using the 1992 revision of the HS (Harmonized System) classification. Its top imports are Cars ($11.8B), Planes, Helicopters, and/or Spacecraft ($3.48B), Packaged Medicaments ($3.34B), Broadcasting Equipment ($3.27B) and Aircraft Parts ($2.18B)\\". On 9 August 2020, Bloomberg reported that Saudi announced cutting down on oil supply to the US, for the third time in one year as an attempt to suppress stockpiles in the global oil market to rebalance the demand and supply. However, experts claim that the strategy worked in 2017 when the demand for oil was high and may bear challenges and risks at the present time, due to the impact of the ongoing coronavirus crisis on oil demand. = Recent years = In the year 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was the United States of America's 20th ranked export market across the globe and ranked 21st in import markets. The most prominent goods set forth as exports to Saudi Arabia in the designated year (2017) were \\"aircraft ($3.6 billion), vehicles ($2.6 billion), machinery ($2.2 billion), electrical machinery ($1.6 billion), and arms and ammunition ($1.4 billion). In terms of statistics, the United States - Saudi Arabian trade declined approximately nine percent in U.S. exports in 2017 compared to the year prior; however, 2017 exemplified great reparation of the relationship through a 57% increase of exports from 2007. Imports between the two nations increased approximately 11 percent from 2017 to 2018, which is an overall decline of 47% since the year fiscal 2007. The entities that the United States of America seeks to import from Saudi Arabia has hardly changed over the years: \\"The top import categories (2-digit HS) in 2017 were: mineral fuels ($18 billion), organic chemicals ($303 million), special other (returns) ($247 million), aluminum ($164 million), and fertilizers ($148 million)\\". = Controversies = Saudi Arabia and the United States of America have never fully eliminated their trading agreements however the relationship has experience consistent disagreements through its history from its conception. In the height of the Syrian Civil War, which started in March 2011, Saudi Arabia expressed disapproval of the United States lack of action in eradicating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States' has consistently expressed disapproval of the treatment of Saudi Arabian women within the confines of the Kingdom. The famous criticisms of the early 21st century behind the relationship between the two countries is due to the mix of the disregard of the aforementioned issues and the public knowledge that trade between Saudi Arabia and the United States has trended upwards in the post 9/11 world. In recent years, the imports and exports of U.S- Saudi trades have not shown a percentage increase each year, where it topped out around 2012 and has been in slight fluctuation since, but the overall trend of trade has shown a positive slope. In 2001: U.S. exports were at $5,957.60 and imports were at $13,272.20 (in millions of U.S. dollars) whereas, controversially as it is believed, in 2012 the United States witnessed $17,961.20 in exports and $55,667.00 in imports. The most damaging occurrence to ever affect the trade relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. occurred on September 11, 2001 due to Saudi Arabia's believed involvement in the 9/11 attacks that occurred in multiple cities throughout the United States. Tensions also rose between the two nations throughout Barack Obama's Presidency due to the United States agreement in the Iran, when the U.S. removed oil sanctions on Iran and allowed them to sell their oil to the U.S. The relationship was also hindered by the oil market crash of 2014, propelled by increased shale oil production in the United States, which in turn caused Saudi Arabian exports of oil to decrease by nearly fifty percent. Oil went from around $110 a barrel prior to the 2014 crash, to about $27 a barrel by the beginning of 2016. This relationship worsened after the U.S. legislation passed a bill of a that allowed victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue the Saudi Arabian government for their losses in 2016. In 2019, US Federal law enforcement officials launched an investigation into cases involving the disappearance of Saudi Arabian students from Oregon and other parts of the country, while they faced charges in the US. Amidst the investigation, it has been speculated that the Saudi government helped the students in escaping from the US. In October 2019, the U.S. Senate passed a bill by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, requiring the FBI to declassify any information regarding Saudi Arabia’s possible role. Oregon officials demand extradition of these suspects by Saudi Arabia since they were involved in violent crimes causing bodily harm and death. On 25 September 2020, the government of Saudi Arabia offered a bond worth $500,000 as cashiers check to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office from the Saudi Arabian consulate in Houston, Texas to bail out Omar Ba-Abbad, an Uber driver charged with the first-degree murder of a passenger in June 2020. Ba-Abbad was driving for a cab service provider, Uber, in June when he got into a fight with a passenger, Jeremy Shadrick. Ba-Abbad ran over Shadrick in the fight, killing him as a result. Ba-Abbad has claimed in his defense that his act was out of self-defense, however, the District Attorney contradicted his claim with video evidence proving otherwise. Notable diplomatic visits U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with King Salman, Riyadh, 27 January 2015 U.S. President Donald Trump, King Salman, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, 21 May 2017 After President George W. Bush's two visits to Saudi Arabia in 2008—which was the first time a U.S. president visited a foreign country twice in less than four months—and King Abdullah's three visits to the US—2002, 2005 and 2008—the relations have surely reached their peak. The two nations have expanded their relationship beyond oil and counter terrorism efforts. For example, King Abdullah has allocated funds for young Saudis to study in the United States. One of the most important reasons that King Abdullah has given full scholarships to young Saudis is to give them western perspective and to impart a positive impression of Saudi Arabia on the American people. On the other hand, President Bush discussed the world economic crisis and what the U.S.–Saudi relationship can do about it. During meetings with the Saudis, the Bush Administration took the Saudi policies very seriously because of their prevalent economic and defensive presence in the region and its great media influence on the Islamic world. By and large, the two leaders have made many decisions that deal with security, economics, and business aspects of the relationship, making it in the top of its fame. In early 2018, the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the United States where he met with many top politicians, business people and Hollywood stars, including President Donald Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and George W. Bush. =2017 US–Saudi Arms Deal= US President Donald Trump authorized a nearly $110B arms deal with Saudi Arabia, worth $300B over a ten-year period, signed on the 20 May 2017, this includes training and close co-operation with the Saudi Arabian military. Signed documents included letters of interest and letters of intent and no actual contracts. US defense stocks reached all-time highs after Donald J. Trump announced a $110 billion arms deal to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia signed billions of dollars of deals with U.S. companies in the arms industry and petroleum industry, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton, Honeywell, McDermott International, Jacobs Engineering Group, National Oilwell Varco, Nabors Industries, Weatherford International, Schlumberger and Dow Chemical. In August, 2018, a laser-guided Mark 82 bomb sold by the U.S. and built by Lockheed Martin was used in the Saudi-led coalition airstrike on a school bus in Yemen, which killed 51 people, including 40 children. On May 27, 2020, Bob Menendez, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee claimed during a CNN op-ed that the Trump administration had been covertly working on plans of initiating a new sale of weapons contract worth $1.8 billion to Saudi Arabia.[1] According to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) analysis, American weapons in Yemen have killed at least 100,000 civilians, and over 10,000 people have died as a result of preventable diseases and epidemics like cholera and dengue fever, most of them children. According to a draft version of the legislation reviewed by the CNN, the Democratic legislatures Senator Robert Menendez, Patrick Leahy and Tim Kaine were planning to introduce a legislation that put strict human rights constraints on the United States foreign arms sales, in the wake of the arms sold in the past by US to countries with poor human rights records like, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. President Donald Trump has also received wide criticism for declaring emergency to bypass the opposition, in order to sell weapons worth billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accused for conducting war crimes.

In it, Hayek further develops the philosophical principles he discussed earlier in The Road to Serfdom, The Constitution of Liberty, and other writings. Law, Legislation and Liberty is more abstract than Hayek's earlier work, and it focuses on the conflicting views of society as either a design, a made order (\\"taxis\\"), on the one hand, or an emergent system, a grown order (\\"cosmos\\"), on the other. These ideas are then connected to two different forms of law: law proper, or \\"nomos\\" coinciding more or less with the traditional concept of natural law, which is an emergent property of social interaction, and legislation, or \\"thesis\\", which is properly confined to the administration of non-coercive government services, but is easily confused with the occasional acts of legislature that do actually straighten out flaws in the nomos.

The term covers a whole range of decorative plaster finishes, from the very highly polished Venetian plaster and Marmorino to the rugged look of textured polished plasters. Polished plaster itself tends to consist of slaked lime, marble dust, and/or marble chips, which give each plaster its distinctive look. A lime-based polished plaster may contain over 40% of marble powder. Polished plaster is mainly used internally, on walls and ceilings, to give a finish that looks like polished marble, travertine, or limestone. Such plasters are usually applied over a primer and basecoat base, from one to four layers. They are finished (burnished) with a specialised steel trowel to a smooth glass-like sheen. Polished plaster is usually sealed with a protective layer of wax. Venetian plaster Venetian plaster is a wall and ceiling finish consisting of plaster mixed with marble dust, applied with a spatula or trowel in thin, multiple layers, which are then burnished to create a smooth surface with the illusion of depth and texture. Venetian plaster techniques include marmorino, scagliola, and sgraffito. When left un-burnished, Venetian plaster has a matte finish that is rough and stone-like to the touch. Un- burnished Venetian plaster is also very brittle and damages rather easily. When applied correctly, Venetian plaster can be used to create a highly polished, rock-hard, marble-like finish. Venetian plaster is especially useful on surfaces where marble panels could not be installed easily, and on surfaces that would be too expensive to have carved from real marble such as columns, corbels, and curved walls. Venetian plaster can be tinted, or colored using natural or synthetic colorants. The ability to tint Venetian plaster is especially helpful when a specific color of \\"marble\\" is desired, or when a color that does not exist naturally is wanted. Through the application of a top layer of wax sealant, Venetian plaster can also be rendered waterproof.

He served in a variety of government positions: first, as the chief of the Bureau of Statistics for the U.S. Department of State, from 1885–1889, then at the U.S. Department of Treasury, 1893–1898, then as chief of the manuscripts division at the Library of Congress from 1902–1908. He also served as Librarian of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University from 1917–1922. American Library Association, RBM, Vol. 6, No. 2, Fall 2005: Interview with Norman Fiering. Family Notoriety Ford was the youngest member of a distinguished and notorious family. He was the great-grandson (through his mother) of Noah Webster. His two younger brothers were Paul Leicester Ford, an eminent biographer and novelist, and Malcolm Webster Ford, a distinguished amateur athlete. Both died May 8, 1902 in a murder-suicide when Malcolm shot Paul and then himself. Historian Ford was best known for his edited collections of a number of Founding Fathers documents, including \\"The writings of George Washington (14 Volumes)\\", \\"Alexander Hamilton's notes in the Federal convention of 1787\\", and \\"Writings of John Quincy Adams\\". He also edited collections of the correspondence of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other figures in early American history. Ford's historical work was also notable for his tenure as chief of the newly established Manuscripts Division at the Library of Congress. During his time in charge, from 1903 to 1909, he organized a significant effort to photograph and copy manuscripts pertaining to early American history which resided in foreign archives (especially France, Britain, and Spain). In this way, copies of many documents which had been missing since 1812 or earlier were recovered.American Historical Review, Vol. 90, No. 1, (Feb., 1985), pp. 16–17 In addition, he edited and published the complete Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789. Ford was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1907.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Ford was active in the American Historical Association and was elected President in 1917. Ford's presidential address, The Editorial Function in United States History, is notable for its careful exposure of the deliberate omissions made by early editors of the Founding Fathers papers, including faked memoirs, papers edited to hide controversies important at the time, and other \\"crimes and errors\\" common in the editing and publishing of historical documents of the time. American Historical Review 23:2 (January 1918): pp. 273–86 Ford defended the American purchase and annexation of the Philippines from Spain during the Philippine–American War by saying \\"Questions of Conscience need not trouble us.... Here are rich lands, held by those who do not or cannot get the best out of them, and awaiting the fructifying application of capital and organization in commerce. Under this beneficent view the natives, an inferior race, must get out or become laborers. The Filipino is an incumbrance to be got rid of, unless he accepts the mandates of a purchasing and conquering power.\\" Ford also edited collections of works of other American figures, including Letters of Henry Adams (1892–1918), and a collection of Aaron Burr's letters.

Here is a chronicle of the raw determination and pioneer spirit that carries Louis Bleriot across the Channel in 1909, and, more recently, carried Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager around the world in their Rutan Voyager on a single tank of fuel =2. \\"The Adventures Of Flight\\"= This is the account of the master aviators who pushed back the frontiers and found new ways to use aircraft...of test pilots, who displayed that rare combination of qualities: coolness under pressure, courage, flying skill, technological knowledge, and military acrobatics. About pilots who pushed their aircraft to the peak of performance...and of the barnstormers and flying circus performers who demonstrated their daring from country airfields to Hollywood film reels, where all the world could witness their dazzling magic. Appearances include former test-pilot Bob Hoover and the first female Boeing 747 flight commander Lynn Rippelmeyer. =3. \\"The Aeroplane goes to War\\"= Over France in World War I, where man and flying machines were first forged into a formidable fighting unit. At the start of the war, the adversaries could muster only a few hundred frail aircraft between them. Yet, in less than 4 years, Britain had commissioned an independent Air Force, had built over 50,000 aircraft and trained 26,000 pilots for observation, strafing, bombing and whatever was necessary to protect its air space. Then, when Anthony Fokker mounted a machine gun on an aeroplane, he changed the face of war forever. This program is a unique historical document, as it features interviews with many World War I aviators from both sides, these included ; George Vaughn, Ray Brooks, Carl-August von Schoenebeck, Wolfram Eisenlohr, and various others. The programme sheds valuable light on these periods of history. The men's recollections are valuable as many of them were already quite old at the time, and such a set of reminiscences can never be recorded again. =4. \\"Victory over the Sea\\"= Since the Second World War, aircraft have played an important role in naval operations...defending the fleet against attack by making it possible for pilots to spot the enemy beyond the horizon. The advantages of naval air power became indisputable with the advent of the aircraft carrier - and the expanded capability to deploy this tactical asset across the vast stretches of the ocean. Having proven themselves from the sinking of the Bismarck to the Pacific War, from Suez and Vietnam to the Falklands, here is military air technology at its most daring, where precision is crucial, and the interface between man and machines reaches the ultimate intimacy The greatest exponents of Naval air power are featured in interviews, particularly the masterful Captain Eric Brown, who in his time has flown virtually every Naval aircraft of World War II, and was a regular contributor to Air International at this period. His introduction of carrier-borne jets is also extremely interesting. The film culminates in the review of the modern carrier. =5. \\"Bombers\\"= Dresden...London...Vietnam...Tokyo..their names alone are dramatic testimony to the awesome power of the bomber. These aircraft came to dominate military strategy during World War II, and still played a critical role in the cold war. Even today, one side finds new ways for the bomber to do its jobs, as the other side seeks ways to stop it. From the activity on board to the devastation below, reaching for the skies looks at the bombers, the pilots who fly them, and the struggle between nations to maintain the ultimate combination of weaponry and technology...a chilling reminder of the ability aviation has given to society to annihilate itself. The film begins with the Boeing B-52, and its effect on the populace of Vietnam. Thereafter, the Heinkel 111, and the bombing of Guernica. This marks the maturity of the Bomber as an instrument of war and of terror. In a similar measure, the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka is reviewed, with interviews of pilots. After this, the next great bomber examined is the Avro Lancaster and its campaign at night over the Third Reich. Then, the Boeing B-17 and daylight bombing over the Reich. The final bomber examined is the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and its career over Japan where it gained the name of Bni-Ju, the fire dragon. To complete the film, and thus the maturity of the Bomber as a tool of war, the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the first and so far last use of Nuclear Weapons in international warfare. =6. \\"Fighters\\"= Few aspects of the history of aviation match the vitality, drama and scale of the World War II fighter planes. As the strategists discovered the advantages of these warships of the skies, armies rarely moved across the battlefield without the security of air cover. This episode evokes the life and times of the fighter pilot and his aircraft, from World War II to the present...of individual determination and technological innovation working together in synchronous perfection. From Korea to the Middle East, to Vietnam, here is the testing ground for skill, technology, and, above all, human courage and self- sacrifice. The film begins with the EAP, and by far the most romantic musical expression of the main theme, played on piano. The first fighter looked at after the credits is the General Dynamics F-16, accompanied by a soft-rock electric guitar solo. The first fighter looked at in detail is the North American P-51 Mustang. Film of preserved airworthy examples of the Confederate Airforce is used, and among the group formation is the sole airworthy P-51H. P-51 aces discuss their memories of combat over Germany in conjunction with bomber forces, and include Brig. General Robin Olds, and Brig. General Charles Yeager. The Spitfire is examined in passing, and Heinz Lerche, the test pilot of the Dornier 335 Pfiel talks about his impressions. The development of Jet fighters is next, and a short amount of time is spent examining the Gloster E38/39 Pioneer, followed by the Messerschmidt 262 Schwalbe. Thereafter the Korean War becomes the subject. MiG Alley, and the contest between Sabre and MiG-15 is again reminisced about by the Aces. General Olds is again a fund of information, with humorous comments about early Sabre strength and reliability, though with praise for more mature variants. Thereafter, Vietnam, at the time the last significant air engagement the USAF had fought. General Olds again gives much insight into the weakness of the missile-only F-4 Phantom. Randy Cunningham, and other aces talk about their experiences with SAM's, and the experiences gained being instrumental in the development of the Top Gun weapons school as well as the Aggressor Squadron of the USAF for pilot training. The film ends with an examination of future technologies for fighter aircraft, some of which have long been abandoned, and others which are modern tactical reality. =7. \\"Giants of the Air\\"= The film opens with the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, truly a giant of the Air. The effect of air transport on humanitarian efforts in Ethiopia's famines of the 1980s are examined, using the Lockheed C-130 Hercules to demonstrate the lifesaving power of airlifting. The development of airlift begins with the Junkers Ju 52, in its use in military operations at the beginning of the Second world war. This is followed by the Douglas DC-3 and its role in supporting the Flying Tigers in China, and the Yugoslav Partisans. During the war, an attempt was made to build a successful giant transport in Europe, by Messerschmidt - the Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant. Its performance and career are looked at, with its vulnerability to the B-26 bomber given as an example of its unsuitability to military operations. In the United States, Howard Hughes designs, builds, and ultimately flies the incredible Spruce goose, despite opposition from Owen Brewster in Washington, who pursued Hughes in relation to his intention to rival Pan American World Airways in providing Trans-Atlantic services through his airline Trans World Airlines. It is now known that Brewster did this at the behest of Juan Trippe (see The Aviator (film)). The Hercules flies, and remains even now a true Giant of the Air. With the end of the war, the role of the DC-3, Douglas DC-4, Avro York and Short Sunderland take part in the survival of Berlin during the Berlin Blockade. Gail Halvorsen talks about his involvement in Operation Little Vittles, which gave chocolate in an act of international charity to the poor children of the city during the blockade. A remarkable tale is also related where a DC-3 pilot managed an incredible feat of flying a 10-tonne Avro York load to Berlin, far above the normal 2 tonne load maximum of his DC-3 ! With the development of the Jet Engine, at long last designers have the power to realize the dreams of aerial transport. Key to this were new generation turbojets and resulting turbofans, beginning with the General Electric J79. The Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and its contribution to the Vietnam War and transporting casualties home is reviewed. With the advent of the Pratt & Whitney JT9D, true giants such as the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy take to the air - an aircraft with the ability to accomplish the entire Berlin Airlift in only 5 flights. The film ends with the early detailed footage of the Antonov An-124 Ruslan transport, very similar to the Galaxy, and larger by only a few feet in internal length. =8. \\"Rivals over the Atlantic\\"= The film opens with the launch of the then-new Boeing 747-400 airliner. The development of the jet engine represented a quantum leap in aviation, and revolutionised commercial aviation. Although first developed for fighter aircraft, this engineering triumph changed the world and led to the development of the jet airliner - especially the one which would set the pace for long distance air travel for the next decade - the Boeing 707. Thereafter America supplied the world with jet transports, creating the international network of air routes upon which the whole world has come to depend. Then Europe responded with the Concorde The disaster of the Comet, the dead-end development of the Bristol Brabazon begin the film. The development of the Jet Set is reviewed, including a quick humorous look at Ronald Reagan as related by Alistair Cooke in his glory days as a Hollywood star. We then go on to the 747, and the view expressed by experienced captains. After this, we move on the Concorde, and its development program. We also get to see come film of the vehement opposition by ordinary people in the USA which prevents Concorde from having a market share in the USA, limiting it to the trans-atlantic route. In conclusion, the launch of the Boeing 747-400 is returned to. =9. \\"Trail Blazers\\"= Broadcast, =10. \\"The Quest for Speed\\"= This film begins with the SR-71 Blackbird, expressed as the ultimate expression in the quest for speed. The film, after credits, begins with the 1909 Curtiss biplane, owned and flown by a Dale Kreitz who had been a boy when the aircraft was new. Thereafter the film moves on the Schneider Cup competition, and features unique footage of the Napier Lion-powered Supermarine S.5 with its blood- curdling scream over the water. Concluding the Schneider Cup is the S.6 and S.6b Mary Haizlip, sister of Jimmy Haizlip, talks about her experiences flying in the so-called 'Powder Puff' air races for women in the 1930s, and about the development of aviation technology during that period driven by the quest for speed. In addition, she compares the atmosphere of the races to that possessing Roman crowds at the Circus Maximus. Modern Unlimited Air Racing at Reno, Nevada is then shown, featuring famous racers such as the Rare Bear, Havenought and Critical Mass Hawker Sea Fury racers, as well as leading North American P-51 Mustang racers. Brig. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle then talks about his experiences flying the Gee Bee R-1 when he won the Thompson Trophy in 1935. During World War II, speed increased sequentially in military aircraft, but the desperately brilliant developments of Germany for air defence justifiably deserve special mention - Hanna Reitsch describes the volcanic power and acceleration of the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket-fighter. Brig. General Yeager's flight of the Bell XS-1 through the sound barrier in 1947 is reviewed, along with other X-planes, culminating in the incredible North American X-15 hypersonic research aircraft. Thereafter the conclusion of the film details the flight performance and pilots of the Lockheed SR-71, concluding with high speed conceptions of future air-travel, particularly the National Aerospace Plane and HOTOL. =11. \\"Lighter than Air\\"= Broadcast, =12. \\"Vertical Flight\\"= The film opens with a dazzling display by the Boeing AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter, accompanied by dramatic classical choral music. Examining the history of vertical flight, the program begins with the early helicopters, and then deals with the pivotal breakthrough of the Cierva Rotor-head, followed by an explanation by the modern master of the Autogyro, Ken Wallis accompanied by the last movement of J.S. Bach's 3rd Brandenburg Concerto. Thereafter we move forward to Igor Sikorsky's helicopters, with interview with the great designer at the time of its development, culminating in the flight of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, and the early lifesaving with the Sikorsky R-4, and Sikorsky H-5. Thereafter the focus moves then to the two great periods of helicopter military lifesaving, the Korean War and Vietnam, where the helicopter truly went to war and heroes were made, in the Bell 47, Bell Huey family, and Boeing CH-47 Chinook. The calm recollections of several very decorated veterans of the conflict make for compelling viewing, combined with previously unseen film footage of the conflict. For the 1980s, Frank D. Robinson demonstrates that a helicopter such as his remarkable Robinson R22 represent the pinnacle of point-to-point transport in a small helicopter, and the Bell XV-15 is demonstrated as the true pinnacle of the Helicopter. Of course helicopters are not the only things that go straight up, and the tailsitters such as the Ryan X-13 Vertijet, and the Convair XFY Pogo is examined with a humorous interview with the test pilot, Skeets Coleman. The European experiments are reviewed, such as the Short SC.1, and the Dassault Balzac, finishing with the Harrier, the early Kestrel and Harrier programs being discussed in detail by Bill Bedford, their test pilot, and Sir John Fozard, their designer. The film concludes with a demonstration of the capability of the Harrier in the then-contemporary Falklands War. VHS and book The series was available as a 6 volume VHS set. The book, Reaching for the Skies: The Adventure of Flight by Ivan Rendall (who was also the TV Series Producer) was published in 1990 and made to accompany the series. , .

Repton's picturesque parkland improvements, castellated house and enclosed garden survive almost intact. The estate is the last and most complete of his three recognized Welsh landscape commissions. History The house was built 1803–07 by the Reptons for Charles Rogers in a picturesque castle style that was explicitly modelled on Richard Payne Knight's Downton Castle. John Repton designed an addition to the rear of the house in 1822. John Hiram Haycock added bay windows and his son Edward Haycock Senior remodelled some of the public rooms in a Tudorbethan style in 1833. Edward Haycock later added a Gothic dining-room extension, Romanesque-style porch and the castellated stable courtyard beginning in 1845. The billiard-room, south wing and baronial tower were added about 1867 The plans for the Repton's work are recorded in a 'Red Book', still kept at the house.

Background Born in Donamon Castle in County Roscommon, he was third son of William Caulfeild, 2nd Baron Caulfeild and his wife Mary King, daughter of Sir John King. His two older brothers Toby Caulfeild, 3rd Baron Caulfeild and Robert Caulfeild, 4th Baron Caulfeild died both without male issue and he succeeded to the barony on the latter's death in 1644. Career Having been first a leading Parliamentarian under Oliver Cromwell, he captured Sir Phelim O'Neil in 1653 and executed him for rebellion and the murder of his brother Toby and his family. In 1660, Caulfeild switched his allegiance and supported afterwards King Charles II of England, captaining a troop of horse. After the English Restoration, he took his seat in the Irish House of Lords and was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. In 1661, Caulfeild was appointed Custos Rotulorum of County Armagh and Custos Rotulorum of Tyrone, holding both offices until his death in 1671. He was rewarded the governorship of Fort Charlemont for life in July of the same year, however sold this office to The Crown three years later.

The battle was part of the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860. Background and battle The Spanish expeditionary force, which departed from Algeciras, was composed of 36,000 men, 65 pieces of artillery, and 41 ships, which included steamships, sailboats, and smaller vessels. General Leopoldo O'Donnell personally took charge of the expedition and divided these forces into three corps. These were commanded by General The 5th Marqués de Torreblanca, General Antonio Ros de Olano and General Ramón de Echagüe. Reserves were placed under the command of General The 1st Conde de Reus. Admiral Segundo Díaz Herrero commanded the fleet. The objective of the Spanish forces was to take Tetuán, which had served as a base for raids on Ceuta and Melilla . Hostilities between Moroccan and Spanish troops began on 17 December 1859 when the column commanded by The Marqués de Torreblanca occupied the Sierra de Bullones. On 19 December, Echagüe captured the Palacio del Serrallo. The Conde de Lucena commanded a force that landed at Ceuta on 21 December. By Christmas Day, the three columns had consolidated their positions and awaited orders to advance towards Tetouan. On 1 January 1860, the Conde de Reus advanced towards the port of Guad al Gelu. The Marqués de Torreblanca’s column and the Royal Spanish Navy guarded his flank. Clashes continued until 31 January 1860, when a major Moroccan offensive was stopped. The Conde de Lucena began a march towards the objective of Tétouan, and was supported by forces composed of Catalan volunteers. Covering fire was provided by units commanded by General The Conde de Reus and General Ros de Olano. Spanish artillery inflicted heavy losses on the Moroccan ranks; the Moroccan forces that remained took refuge in Tétouan. The city fell on 6 February 1860. A week of further fighting followed before hostilities ceased. Outcome The capture of Tétouan prevented further attacks on Ceuta and Melilla by Moroccan forces. The Conde de Lucena returned with his troops to Spain; they camped at a spot north of Madrid while a triumphal entry into the capital was arranged. The camp, which acquired permanent structures as well as shops over time, became the Madrid neighbourhood known as Tetuán de las Victorias. In the aftermath of the battle, General Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Conde de Lucena, was elevated in the Spanish peerage to being The 1st Duque de Tetuán. He later served as President of the Council of Ministers (also known as the Prime Minister).

Harrogate was back- to-back Yorkshire Cup champion in 2015 and 2016 and finished in the top six in National Division 2. It is said that Harrogate in Aspinall's tenure had the worst budgets in national league rugby as Harrogate nearly went under just before he took over. Aspinall stepped down from his role at Harrogate in 2016 to concentrate on running his property businesses. Before moving into coaching full-time, Aspinall had played for Saracens, Leeds Tykes/Carnegie, Harrogate and Hull Ionians. He was also capped by England U18 in 2001. His usual position is scrum-half, but in recent years he has regularly appeared at fly- half. Aspinall became head coach at Harrogate in 2007 and, following a strong few seasons for the club, was invited by Andy Key and Neil Back to join the Leeds Carnegie backroom staff in 2010 for their assault on the Premiership. Throughout his time at Leeds, Aspinall continued to play and coach at Harrogate, overseeing a record-equaling 12 game victory streak. Having left Carnegie in summer 2012, Aspinall returned to Harrogate full-time to concentrate on his RFU Level 4 coaching course and to broaden his experiences. In August 2012, Aspinall was appointed Head Coach at Manchester University and introduced a new coach mentoring system at Harrogate. Aspinall is now the managing director of Northern Property Partners based in Leeds and is said to be taking a few years out of the game.

With more than 30 exhibit buildings to explore, the museum tells the story of three centuries of Irish emigration. Using costumed guides and displays of traditional crafts, the museum focuses on those who left Ulster for America in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is part of National Museums Northern Ireland. Within the museum there are many restored, original buildings with connections to local families. The park was developed around the Mellon House, the birthplace of Irish-American banker and lawyer Thomas Mellon, founding father of the Mellon banking dynasty. This house and its outbuildings remain in their original location. Visitors can taste samples of traditional Irish and pioneer American foods including freshly baked soda bread and pumpkin pie all made on the hearths and griddles of the exhibit buildings. The museum also includes agricultural displays and an array of farm animals. The park is open throughout the year, excluding some public holidays. Theme The demonstrations that take place showcase the day-to-day tasks and skills of those who lived in the era such as blacksmithing, candle-dipping, embroidery, spinning, printing, and open hearth cooking. The museum runs a lively programme of events and exhibitions that connect to their collections. The museum has also hosted many international exhibitions in recent years including Fighting Irishmen from the Irish Arts Center in New York which showcased the influence of Irish emigrants in the sport of boxing, and Warriors of the Plains from the British Museum, which explored Native North American Indians. Special events mark the culture of both the New World and the Old World, such as U.S. Independence Day, Halloween, Easter and of course Saint Patrick's Day. The melting pot of emigrant music is celebrated with a three-day Bluegrass Music Festival every September. The museum's visitor centre houses a cafe and shop as well as the permanent exhibition Emigrants that introduces the story of emigration from Ireland to America, before visitors embark on their journey around the outdoor museum and along the emigrant trail. Free parking is available on site. one of the many cottage houses located at the Ulster American Folk Park  Sections  =Research and education= The entrance section includes a restaurant, a visitors' information centre and the Centre for Migration Studies (CMS). The CMS has an attached library and offers, in conjunction with the University of Ulster and Queen's University of Belfast, postgraduate and undergraduate courses, as well as tailored and shorter courses; all of the courses concern the study of Irish migration from 1600 to the present day. The specialist research library contains some 10,000 volumes, over 50 periodicals, maps, audio-visual material, and a collection of primary source documents (the Irish Emigration Database) which is searchable on computer. The centre is open to visitors during basic office hours, and closed during public holidays. =Old World= Mellon House is the birthplace of Thomas Mellon wax candles are home- made The Old World region includes whole streets of original houses, an original printing press, a bank, an old police barracks, the old Castletown National School, and two churches. Central to this region is the boyhood home of Thomas Mellon, judge and founder of the Pittsburgh banking dynasty. Some of the two-up, two-down houses in one of the reconstructed streets in the park were transported, in their entirety, from Sandy Row, off the Donegall Road in Belfast, and other buildings have been transported from elsewhere in the province. =New World= Linking the Old and New World sections of the park is the Ship and Dockside gallery, which includes the Brig Union, a full-size replica of an immigrant sailing ship. The historic atmosphere continues in the New World area, which features a recreated old American street with a tinsmith display and the original interior of a Virginia general store. Beyond the street, the frontier journey begins with a stop at the 1720s Fulton stone house, painstakingly dismantled in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and rebuilt here. Other original frontier houses in the park include an Appalachian log house from Washington county, Pennsylvania, the 1830 West Virginia home of Richard McCallister, removed from Cabell county, and a, soon to be opened, brick plantation house built by Francis Rogan in the early 19th century near Nashville, Tennessee.

He was the Manasse Professor of Letters and Science and the Hilldale Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and also was formerly the Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Mathematics at Emory University. He is currently the Thomas Jefferson Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia, the Vice President of the American Mathematical Society, and the Chair of the Mathematics Section in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Early life and education Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who emigrated from Japan to the United States after World War II. His older brother, immunologist and university president Santa J. Ono, was born while Takashi Ono was in Canada working at the University of British Columbia, but by the time Ken Ono was born the family had returned to the US for a position at the University of Pennsylvania.. Although primarily a profile of Ono's brother, this article also includes some details of Ono's early family life. In the 1980s, Ono attended Towson High School, but he dropped out. He later enrolled at the University of Chicago without a high school diploma. There he raced bicycles, and he was a member of the Pepsi–Miyata Cycling Team. He received his BA from the University of Chicago in 1989, where he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He earned his PhD in 1993 at UCLA where his advisor was Basil Gordon. Initially he planned to study medicine, but later switched to mathematics. He attributes his interest in mathematics to his father. Career and research Ono's contributions include several monographs and over 160 research and popular articles in number theory, combinatorics, and algebra. He is considered to be an expert in the theory of integer partitions and modular forms. In 2000 he greatly expanded Ramanujan's theory of partition congruences, and in work with Kathrin Bringmann he has made important contributions to the theory of Maass forms, functions which include Ramanujan's mock theta functions as examples. In 2007 Don Zagier gave a Seminar Bourbaki address on the work of Bringmann, Ono, and Zwegers on the mock theta functions. The 2009 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, awarded to a young mathematician under the age of 32, was awarded to Kathrin Bringmann for this joint work with Ono. Ono has received many awards for his research. In April 2000 he received the Presidential Career Award (PECASE) from Bill Clinton in a ceremony at the White House, and in June 2005 he received the National Science Foundation Director's Distinguished Teaching Scholar Award at the National Academy of Science. He has also won a Sloan Fellowship, a Packard Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-03-20. In 2011 and 2015 Ono gave TED talks. In a joint work with Jan Bruinier, he discovered a finite algebraic formula for computing partition numbers. He stars in the 2013 docudrama \\"The genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan\\". He is profiled in the May 2014 issue of Scientific American. He was an Associate Producer and the mathematical consultant for the movie The Man Who Knew Infinity based on Ramanujan's biography written by Robert Kanigel. Ken Ono was chaired, on June 7th 2019, as Thomas Jefferson Professor of Mathematics, at the University of Virginia.Fall 2019, Thomas Jefferson Professor of Mathematics: https://math.virginia.edu/people/ono/ A framework for the Rogers–Ramanujan identities In April 2014 Ono announced that he and two others had found a framework for the Rogers–Ramanujan identities and their arithmetic properties, solving a long-standing mystery stemming from the work of Ramanujan. The findings yield a treasure trove of algebraic numbers and formulas to access them. Ono's co-authors for this work were S. Ole Warnaar of the University of Queensland and Michael Griffin, an Emory University graduate student. Their work made world news that year and was ranked 15th among the top 100 stories of 2014 in science in Discover magazine. After 15 years of focusing on the Rogers–Ramanujan identities, Warnaar had found a way to embed them into a much larger class of similar identities using representation theory. When Ono saw Warnaar's work, \\"It just clicked,\\" Ono recalls. \\"Now we can extract infinitely many functions whose values are algebraic numbers.\\" Proof of the Umbral Moonshine Conjecture In a joint paper (co-authored with John Duncan and Michael Griffin), Ono proved the Umbral moonshine Conjecture. This conjecture was formulated by Miranda Cheng, John Duncan, and Jeff Harvey, and is a generalization of the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture proved by Fields medalist Richard Borcherds. Work on the Riemann Hypothesis In May 2019 Ono published a joint paper (co-authored with Don Zagier and two former students) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the Riemann Hypothesis. Their work proves a large portion of the Jensen-Polya criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis. However, the Riemann Hypothesis remains unsolved. Their work also establishes the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble random matrix condition in derivative aspect for the derivatives of the Riemann Xi function. Fields medalist Enrico Bombieri published a commentary in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA explaining the significance of this work. Personal life In recent years, Ono has resumed athletic training as a runner, swimmer and cyclist; since 2012, he has competed in triathlons as a member of Team USA.

The club's name When the club was first founded in 1928, it named itself Derry City Football Club, as opposed to using the official name of the city - Londonderry. Nationalists generally refer to the city as 'Derry', while unionists call it 'Londonderry'. At the time of the club's naming, however, the dispute would not have been as politicised as it is in the current day and those who founded the club specifically decided against using the name of the city's previous primary club, Derry Celtic F.C., with the aim of offering a more inclusive support-base to football fans in the city. Including \\"Celtic\\" in the club's name might have been perceived as being a strong statement of Irish nationalist identity and could have alienated Protestants in the city. Colours and jerseys A selection of past home-kit variations. Derry City wore claret and blue jerseys with white shorts for their first season of football - 1929–30. These were the identical colours to those of Aston Villa, who were a globally renowned footballing power at the time. This scheme lasted until 1932, when the club's first change of colours saw the club directors decide that white jerseys with black shorts should be worn by the team for the 1932–33 season. The style, like that which had come before it, lasted just two seasons and was replaced by the now-traditional red and white \\"candystripes\\" with black shorts upon the club's changing of its official colours to that of the modern day for the beginning of the 1934–35 season. The current colours of the red and white striped jersey with black shorts are derived from an early connection with Sheffield United, who wear the identical pattern. Specifically, the colour-change should be attributed to Billy Gillespie. Gillespie, a native of nearby Donegal, played for Sheffield United over a twenty-year period from 1913 until 1932, and scored over 137 league and cup goals in 492 games for the South Yorkshire side, as well as captaining them to FA Cup success in 1925. He was the club's most capped player with 25 for Ireland and had started out with Derry Celtic before embarking on a career across the Irish Sea. The man was held in such high regard in his home country that when he left United in 1932 to replace Joe McCleery as manager of Derry City, the club changed their strip to red and white stripes within two years of his arrival in reverence to him and his time at the Blades. Derry have remained in the red and white stripes since, except for the seasons between 1956 and 1962, when the club's players donned an amber and black kit. Derry had been performing poorly and it was felt that a change of colour might help rejuvenate the team. At the time, the colours were strongly associated with Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were a power-house of English football during the 1950s. However, the colours brought Derry no such luck and were unpopular with the fans who sought a return of the by-then traditional red and white stripes. The seasons were a lean time for the club, with an Irish Cup final defeat to Glenavon FC in 1957 being the highlight. A re-introduction of the \\"candystripes\\" for the 1962–63 season saw the fortunes of the club improve as Derry entered their most successful spell in the Irish League. The colours have been retained ever since. Jerseys over the years, although in keeping with the red and white tradition, have varied slightly in the sense that certain seasons saw Derry wear thinner stripes while others saw thicker or stripes with varying thicknesses being worn by the players on the field.Derry now wear white socks when sporting their full home rig, while they originally wore black ones. Similarly, the club adopted white shorts instead of black ones for a spell in the early 1970s and later in 1985 for their initial season in the League of Ireland. The club's away tops have varied in colour from plain white, to navy and green stripes, to white and light-blue stripes, and to black. Derry have had their kits supplied by various manufacturers over the years, including Adidas, Avec, Erreà, Fila, Le Coq Sportif, Matchwinner, O'Neills, Spall and currently, Umbro. Commercial sponsorship logos to appear on the front of shirt have included Northlands (a local alcohol and drugs treatment and awareness organisation), Warwick Wallpapers, Fruit of the Loom, Smithwick's, and AssetCo. Other sponsorship logos to have appeared on the sleeve have included the Trinity Hotel, Tigi Bed Head and Tigi Catwalk. For the 2007 season, the logos of local media, Q102.9 and the Derry News, appear on the back of the shirt just below the neck, along with the logo of Meteor Electrical on the jersey's front. Crests The city's coat of arms, used by the club as a crest prior to the introduction of a unique club crest in 1986, seen in a decoration on the Craigavon Bridge. Derry City's first exclusive crest, introduced in 1986 and replaced in 1997. Although the club did not traditionally sport a crest on the club jersey as the concept had not yet become popularised (probably due to the complications and vast time-consumption involved in mass-producing intricate designs before greater technological advancement occurred), throughout the years playing in the Irish League - and for most of the first season in the League of Ireland - Derry City used the coat of arms of the city, rather than having an exclusive crest of their own. This crest often appeared on club memorabilia such as scarves, hats and badges. The symbols on Derry's arms were, and still are, a skeleton, a three-towered castle, a red St. George's cross and sword. The sword and cross were devices of the City of London and, along with an Irish harp embedded within the cross, demonstrated the link between the two cities (The city's official name under UK law is, of course, Londonderry), in particular, the association with the Honourable the Irish Society which had been granted lands in and around the city in the past. The castle was thought to relate to a 13th or 14th century keep belonging to the local native chieftains. There were many theories about the skeleton; the most popular being that it is that of a Norman de Burca knight who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332. This was accompanied by the Latin motto, \\"Vita, veritas, victoria\\", meaning \\"Life, truth, victory.\\" In April 1986, just under a year after the senior rebirth of the club and its entry into the League of Ireland, the DCFC ran a competition in local schools to design a new club crest. The winning entry was by John Devlin, a fourth-year student at St Columb's College, and made its début on 5 May 1986 when Derry City entertained Nottingham Forest at Brandywell Stadium for a friendly match. The crest depicted a simplified version of the city's Foyle Bridge, which had opened 18 months previously, the traditional red and white candy-stripes associated with the shirt of the club bordered by thin black lines and the year in which Derry City was established as a club, as well as a football in the centre representing the fact that the club is a footballing entity. The club's name featured in Impact font. This crest lasted until July 1997, when the current crest was unveiled at Lansdowne Road when Derry City played Celtic in a pre- season tournament. The modernised crest, once again, featured a centred football, the club's name and the year of founding. The famous red a white candy-stripes were present along with a red mass of colour filling the left half of the crest, separated from the right by a white stripe. Known cultural landmarks or items associated with the city are absent from the badge. The origins of this crest are not fully known and the reason for the change in 1997 has never been explained by the club, although it is likely that the club simply wished to develop a fresher, more contemporary image with a minimalist design and also because the Foyle Bridge was no longer as novel, trendy or innovative a feature as it were in the mid-to-late 1980s. Rivalries A friendly rivalry is currently maintained with local Donegal club, Finn Harps. While both have encountered times of financial trouble in recent years, they have often been helped by the other in this regard. Their success cannot be said to have occurred without this. Finn Harps were one of the major proponents of Derry's joining of the League of Ireland in 1985. Phil Coulter is known as a fan of both sides, and has been instrumental in keeping them as operational football clubs. With Derry now consistently staying in the top- tier and Finn Harps having a hard time maintaining top-flight status, their much-anticipated Northwest derby is now a rarer affair than it once was. Derry also share a northwest derby game with Sligo Rovers, although Sligo is not in as close proximity to Derry as Ballybofey is. The mid-eighties saw Derry's biggest rivalry coming in the form of Dublin's St. Patrick's Athletic - a side which contained former Republic of Ireland international and Middlesbrough defender, Curtis Fleming, TV3 pundit Paul Osam and ex Derry manager, Pat Fenlon. In recent years, Dublin's Shelbourne FC were seen as top-of-the-table rivals with games between the two often being crucial to the ultimate winning of the league. In turn, these games were often very exciting six-pointers. There is another club in Derry known as Institute FC, but because the clubs play under different associations no intense footballing rivalry exists, although Institute generally take their support from the city's Protestant or unionist community, as opposed to Derry City, who generally take theirs from the Catholic or nationalist one. During Derry's time in the Irish League, south Belfast's successful Linfield FC were commonly viewed as the team to beat. Derry also enjoyed an intense rivalry with fellow North West club Coleraine FC. A number of Protestants from Derry follow Coleraine. In 1995 Coleraine and Derry played a two-legged, cross-association Irish News Cup semi-final. Coleraine won the first leg at the Brandywell 2-0 before a scoreless draw in the second leg at Coleraine. Coleraine brought a huge support to the Brandywell but Derry fans chose to boycott the return leg at the Showgrounds for one reason or another. Match-day programme Cityview is the name of the club's official match programme. Since 1985, League of Ireland match-day experiences at Brandywell stadium have been augmented by the programme. Every league, FAI Cup, League Cup, and European fixture over the past 22 years has been catered for from the day the late Paddy Doherty put pen to paper in the summer of 1985 right up to the articles which are currently being created for the 2007 season. Cityview provides loyal Derry City fans and supporters of opposition clubs visiting the Brandywell with information on current affairs within the world of Irish football; League of Ireland, Irish League, Setanta Cup, European, and world football news; player profiles, statistics and interviews; team news and information on player injuries and suspensions; fan views and opinion pieces from long-serving contributors; a fan focus; a regular message from the manager; a half-time quiz; a layout of Brandywell stadium and safety directives; Derry City's history and honours; under-21 and under-18 sections; and an editorial on the game and opposition. Cityview has gone from strength-to-strength in recent years. On various occasions in Derry City's highly successful 2006 campaign, Cityview sold more than 1,000 copies in an hour prior to the game. It is estimated that Derry City's programme committee met the demand for in the region of 20,000 copies last season, and seek to better that over the course of the 2007 season. Fully supported by local, national, and international corporate entities, Cityview provides prospective sponsors with the ability to not only align themselves with the success of Derry City, but to actually make a valuable contribution to that success. The benefit to each advertiser is that in excess of 15,000 copies are sold sporting their advertisement or sponsorship. Cityview is open to submissions from supporters of the club in general and aims to air the views of everyone who elects to contribute to the content of the programme. The price of the programme for the 2007 season is £2 at games, all of which goes directly towards the future development of the club and its finances, as well as ensuring that League of Ireland football remains at the forefront of sporting life in the city. As of the 2007 season, a single issue or an entire season's copies are available to purchase online from anywhere in the world after the programme committee decided that Derry City supporters around the globe should have the opportunity to purchase the club's official match-day programme. Cityview arrives in the hands of football fans hot off the press at the Brandywell, and fans of the Candystripes from around the world who order their subscription have their copy of Cityview dispatched to them on the day of the game. Supporters Derry City's fans in the Parc des Princes, Paris on 28 September 2006. By Irish footballing standards, Derry City have a relatively large and deeply loyal fan-base. Upon the club's entry into the League of Ireland in 1985, crowds of 10,000 regularly flocked to the Brandywell to see their team. The \\"red and white army\\", as they are known in reference to the club's red and white colours, are regarded as being one of the largest, noisiest and most colourful groups following a team in the League of Ireland.\\"Kenny elated after Derry triumph\\", BBC Sport Online, 10 August 2006.\\"Video recording of Derry City fans during their club's FAI Cup semi- final tie away to Sligo Rovers\\", YouTube, 2006-10-29. Retrieved on 2007-04-30. Derry's average home attendance of 3,127 was the highest of any league team for the 2006 season and they are known to bring substantial numbers to away games, despite their isolation in the north-west. Furthermore, the highest attendance in the Premier Division was the last-night-of-the-season meeting between Derry City and Cork City FC at the Brandywell on Friday 17 November when 6,080 watched Derry exact some measure of revenge for their defeat in the reverse of the fixture the season before (which incidentally was also the highest attendance in 2005). Derry's supporters gave their team remarkable support in the club's UEFA Cup run during the 2006 season - around 3,000 travelled to Motherwell to see Derry beat Gretna FC 5–1 in Fir Park, while over 2,000 made their way to Paris to see their team play PSG in the Parc des Princes. Fans often use the high vantage point of the City Cemetery in Creggan to view games for which they have failed to source tickets or simply to view the games at a distance for free.Carton, Donna. \\"Bus is just the ticket for fans\\", Sunday Mirror, 2006-09-03.

The club is renowned for its warm, close- knit, community spirit and the supporters have played a pivotal role in the survival and successes of the club over the years. When massive debts brought Derry close to extinction in the 2000–01 season, the local community responded en masse and saved the club. During the club's successful 2006 season, club legend, Peter Hutton said: Support for the club crosses numerous social boundaries. Many fans reside in working class areas, such as the nearby Brandywell, Creggan and Bogside, while others are derived from more affluent regions of the city, like Culmore. While the Cityside is commonly seen as the traditional base of the club, and especially the Brandywell area, the Waterside area of the city, with its sizable Protestant population, boasts a significant support base. Despite the perception of Derry City being a nationalist-supported club, it does have numerous supporters who would be of a Protestant upbringing. With the city viewed as a focal point of culture and activity serving the north-west region of Ireland, Derry's support stretches beyond the urban border of the city and into the surrounding county. Limavady contains a significant support base, as does Strabane in nearby County Tyrone and even areas of bordering County Donegal. Derry City Chat is a supporters' discussion forum website run by fans of the club. The club itself has from time-to-time made announcements on this forum. =Supporters' clubs= There are a number of supporter groups following Derry City, including: twelfth man on tour. *Brandywell Pride: *Brandywell Pride: Brandywell Pride was founded in 1997 by a group of supporters who had been travelling to Derry City's away games for a number of years. Presently, the club has around 30 core-members, who travel week-in and week-out to support Derry City, five of whom form the club's organising committee. The committee members are Gerry Houston (Chairman), Brian Martin (Vice-Chairman), Fergal Tuffy (Treasurer), Adrian McGowan and Gary Barnfield. Derry City's fans in the Brandywell on the day of a game. The group aims to assist Derry City and club officials in any way possible, from dealing with ticket allocations to providing player sponsorship. It has been in a position to buy shares in the club itself, as well contributing to several fund-raising drives by selling tickets. The Brandywell Pride Supporters Club has several main goals. They aim to: support Derry City in attempting to be the biggest club in Ireland, through fundraising and generating support on the terraces, both home and away; to provide Derry supporters with an opportunity to attend as many games as possible; to utilise drums, instruments, flags and other equipment to create as noisy and colourful an atmosphere as is possible; to attract younger members of the community to attend the Brandywell in support of their local team and experience the ups and downs of live football often denied to them due to a developed Irish tradition of supporting English or Scottish teams; and to assist Derry City in whatever way possible, including working with various other supporters clubs and voluntary organisations ensuring that the club reaches its potential. Primarily the club is about colour and noise that contribute to the friendly and enjoyable atmosphere in the Brandywell and various away grounds on match-days. The supporters club has gone from strength to strength since its founding and has received considerable media attention, featuring on both the BBC and UTV. On 24 August 2006, Kevin \\"Scaldy\\" Cairns of the club, who beats a bass drum during games, received a reception from the Mayor of Derry, Helen Quigley, at the city's Guildhall for his dedication and commitment in supporting Derry City.\\"Mayor extends best wishes to Derry City FC \\", Derry City Council press release, 24 August 2006. Tommy \\"Harmonica\\" Gallagher is also a stalwart and has been an ever-present member since the club's initiation playing songs and melodies all over Ireland, with his trademark tune being his own version of the old Irish favourite Whiskey in the Jar. Fans of Derry City display flags during the 2007 Setanta Sports Cup. The club holds monthly meetings in the Oak Grove Bar in Bishop Street, Derry. Here, the club has its own club room, fully furnished with various items of club memorabilia. The Oak Grove is a popular haunt for pre and post-match refreshments, where every kick is previewed and replayed. Brandywell Pride also holds an annual prize giving night for the Derry City players at the close of each season within the establishment. A selection of supporter flags hanging in the Brandywell. A flag depicting the Argentinian-born Cuban revolutionary, Che Guevara, whose image became popular after Stephen Kenny initiated what fans described as a 'candystriped revolution', can be seen alongside a flag with the term 'Ultras' emblazoned across it. Also featured, is a flag in protest of the poor facilities in which the club is forced to play. As the club's ground is currently owned by the Derry City Council, the club itself has no say over development of the stadium. It does, however, have intentions to purchase the land and renovate but the process has been continually delayed. The flag contains the slogan: \\"Derry City: World Class, Brandywell: Third World.\\". *City Exiles Supporters Club: Formed following a discussion in Derry City's chatroom during a match in May 2006, the club has members in Austria, Canada, England, the Isle of Man, Italy, Scotland, the United States and beyond. The total membership numbers 23 and includes an honorary member, David Tennant. They presented their first 'Player of the Year' award to Ciarán Martyn in 2006. * Dublin Supporters Club: The Dublin Supporters Club was officially set up in 2006, but it had been unofficially running for many years prior to that. The aim of the club is to allow Derry City fans based in Dublin to meet up and arrange travels to home and away games, as well as to help organise meeting in the city before the numerous games that the club plays in Dublin each year. During the 2006 season the club had 25 members. *Post Office Supporters Club *The Pride of Northside Supporters Club: The Pride of Northside Supporters Club was founded in 1994 by a group of Derry City supporters and has since grown to establish itself amongst the community as a highly respectable organisation. The club is diverse with, currently, 20 core-members. The club has members across the community, both men and woman, and they consider themselves non-sectarian, non-sexist and non-racist. The main aim is to assist in the promotion and support of Derry City Football Club in the community and football generally. Furthermore, the club provides an opportunity to travel to home and away fixtures. However, the Pride of Northside group is not just about football; throughout the year other private functions are organised, such as outings to the theatre or fishing trips. Also, in the first week of June, the group arranges a week's holiday with usually 15 members attending. The club enjoys a good time overall, both home and away. The official website is filled with general information, including details regarding membership, coach details, post-match analysis and plans for meetings in addition to many photos. *Queen's University Belfast Supporters Club: The club had run in the 1980s and 90s but was reformed in 2003 to try to help City fans based in Belfast to attend games at home and away. The club is based at the Queen's University and takes advantage of the funds and facilities on offer to clubs and societies there, even though a large number of members are non-students, be they graduates of Queen's, or indeed just Derry folk based in Belfast and the surrounding area. The club tries to cater for all City fans based east of the Bann and makes pick-ups at various points on their way to and from games. *The Tr3ble Army: The Treble Army supporters club was set up by a group of Derry City supporters in December 2005. The club currently has 24 official members. The name was suggested by a club member and is a reference to Derry's historic treble-winning team of 1989. The club chairperson is Sean Grant, the vice- chairperson is Conor Duddy, the club secretary is Finnuala McCartney and Nicola Moran is the club's treasurer. *United Supporters Club: The Derry City United Supporters Club was founded in 2007 and is made up entirely of non- nationals residing in the city of Derry. The club has 25 members from all over the world including Africa, South America and Europe and countries such as Iran, Nicaragua, Côte d'Ivoire, El Salvador, Honduras and Belize.

A proportion of these express the fans' undying loyalty for the team, which they swear will remain as strong as ever through thick and thin. Examples include: The fans also regularly sing verses of Teenage Kicks by the Derry band, The Undertones, viewing it as somewhat of a city anthem. Chants heard from the stands include the timed repetition of the phrase \\"red and white army\\" and the continental-like shout of \\"D-C-F-C, allez, allez, allez\\". The latter is a chant derived from the supporters' 2006 UEFA Cup experience in Paris and is often accompanied by a performance of the \\"Grecque\\", which is popular amongst fans of PSG and had been enacted by them on the night. It was also imitated by Derry fans for the first time during the game along with the opposition fans.\\"Video of Derry City fans performing the \\"Grecque\\"\\", YouTube, 28 September 2006. In popular culture Derry City have made numerous appearances in popular and general culture. In the world of music, the club was given exposure by Derry punk band, The Undertones, who had the cover of their 1980 hit single, My Perfect Cousin, feature a Subbuteo figure sporting the colours of Derry City. The song's video saw the group's front-man, Feargal Sharkey, kick and leap to head a ball while wearing the red and white jersey.Bradley, Michael. \\"The Undertones Connection \\", CityWeb, 1991-11-07.

Zero Seven Media, p. 48. . The club has also featured on popular television. Because they are a club based in Northern Ireland playing in the league of the Republic of Ireland they often receive the attention of broadcasters in both jurisdictions. A bizarre own-goal, in which the opposition goal-keeper was lobbed from outside the box by a player from his own team, scored by Finn Harps' Terry Leake for Derry City during a 1989-90 season Brandywell-meeting once appeared on the \\"What happened next?\\" round of the BBC's A Question of Sport.Wilson (2007), p. 50. Furthermore, in the BBC documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? shown the night before Derry's clash with Paris St. Germain in the 2006-07 UEFA Cup's First Round, it was highlighted that Archie McLeod, the grandfather of David Tennant, the tenth Doctor Who, was a Derry City player. Derry had supplied a lucrative signing-on fee and had enticed him over from the highlands of Scotland.Barratt, Dr. Nick. \\"Who do you think you are?

Irish television has also featured the club. Derry City played in the first League of Ireland match ever to be shown live on television when they visited Tolka Park to play Shelbourne during the 1996-97 season. The game was broadcast on RTÉ's Network 2 and finished 1-1 with Gary Beckett scoring for Derry. In addition, during an 8 January 2007 episode of RTÉ's The Panel, Irish comedian, Karl Spain, was seen drinking from a mug displaying the crest of Derry City. Although Spain himself is not known to be a fan of Derry, one of the shows producers, Seamus Cassidy from Derry, is. During the next show one week later, fellow comedian, Dara Ó Briain, was also seen drinking from the mug. On 22 January 2007 the mug was seen in the hands of a third panellist, Irish television and radio personality, Ray D'Arcy.\\"The Panel: THE MUG, and THAT mug in particular\\", RTÉ.ie, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-04-30. Another medium to play host to the club has been the radio. On 20 April 2005, Derry City featured in an audio documentary The Blues and the Candy Stripes on RTÉ Radio 1's Documentary on One. The documentary was produced in the aftermath of the historic friendly game between Derry and Linfield that took place on 22 February 2005 — the first between the two teams to occur since a game on 25 January 1969 during which Linfield's fans had to be evacuated from the Brandywell by police at half-time due to civil unrest and ugly scenes within the ground.\\"The Blues and the Candy Stripes\\", RTÉ.ie, 2005-04-20.

The 2005 match was organised as somewhat of a security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan- bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future Setanta Cup competition. Moreover, the club has appeared in a joke perpetrated by local printed press outlet, the Derry Journal, who once reported that Gary Lineker had signed for Derry. However, the date of the publication was 1 April, and the story was an April Fools' prank.

In its time it was the 43rd largest orchestra in the United States and performed a variety of programs including the Post-Standard Classics Series and M&T; Bank Pops Series. The orchestra also operated two youth orchestras in the Syracuse area: the Syracuse Symphony Youth Orchestra and the Syracuse Symphony Youth String Orchestra. History It was founded in 1961 as a community orchestra by a grant from the Gifford Foundation. Its first Music Director was Karl Kritz, assisted by Benson Snyder and Carolyn Hopkins. In its first season it performed four subscription concerts at the Lincoln High School and eight young people's concerts plus one pops concert. By the end of its third season, permanent chamber groups had been formed - a string quartet, a woodwind quintet, a brass quintet and a percussion ensemble. Assisted by a Ford Foundation Challenge Grant, their budget grew, and recordings were regularly being broadcast on WONO-FM. A new location was found for their regular concerts at Henninger High School, while regional concerts in Watertown, Rome and Cortland followed. In 1975, the orchestra moved into its last home, the Crouse Hinds Theater in the John H. Mulroy Civic Center Theaters at Oncenter. In 2011, the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy; a core group of forty musicians continued as self-managed Symphony Syracuse. On December 14, 2012, musician-owned and operated organization Musical Associates of Central New York announced their new orchestra in Syracuse, named Symphoria.

It also played for Syracuse Opera performances. Performances were broadcast twice weekly on WCNY-FM. Awards In 1999 the orchestra was presented with the Governor’s Arts Award in recognition of its activities within the region. Finances The orchestra was a non-profit organization which was supported in part through its volunteer organization, the Syracuse Symphony Association and a 60-member board of directors. Twice in its history the orchestra had been forced to cut short its season due to budgetary issues. The first time was in the spring of 1992 and the second in the spring of 2011. In both cases the orchestra could not raise enough funds to cover its operating budget for the year. In early April 2011, the orchestra announced plans to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that indicates that the organization planned to liquidate itself and go out of operation. Unfunded pension obligations were blamed.

Its original French title is La noire de… , which means \\"The black girl/woman of…\\", as in \\"someone's black girl\\", or \\"black girl from…\\". The film centers on Diouana, a young Senegalese woman, who moves from Dakar, Senegal to Antibes, France to work for a rich French couple. In France, Diouana hopes to continue her former nanny job and anticipates a cosmopolitan lifestyle. But from her arrival in Antibes, Diouana experiences harsh treatment from the couple, who force her to work as a servant. She becomes increasingly aware of her constrained and alienated situation and starts to question her life in France. This was the director's first feature- length film. It is often considered the first Sub-Saharan African film by an African filmmaker to receive international attention.Weiler, A. H. \\"2 From Senegal:Feature and Short Are at the New Yorker\\" The New York Times, 13 January 1969 Plot The plot continually shifts back and forth between Diouana's present life in France where she works as a domestic servant, and flashbacks of her previous life in Senegal. In the flashbacks, it is revealed that she comes from a poor village outside of Dakar. Most people are illiterate and Diouana would roam the city looking for a job. One day, 'Madame' comes to the square looking for a servant and selects Diouana from amongst the unemployed women because she was submissive and did not crowd forward demanding a job. She hires Diouana initially to care for her children in Dakar. As a gift, Diouana gives her employers a traditional mask that she had bought from a small boy for 50 guineas, and they display it in their home. When Diouana is not working she goes for walks with her boyfriend. Monsieur and Madame then offer Diouana a job working for them in France. Diouana is thrilled, and immediately begins dreaming of her new life in France. Once she arrives, Diouana is overwhelmed with cooking and cleaning for the rich couple and their friends. They treat her harshly, give her few breaks, and Diouana is confused as to her role. She thought that she would be caring for children, as in Senegal, and would be able to go outside and see something of France. In fact, she is always inside, cooking and cleaning the house. When she works, she wears a fancy dress and heels. The mistress of the house tells her to remove them, telling her \\"don't forget that you are a maid\\". At one of their dinner parties, one of their friends kisses Diouana without her consent, explaining \\"I've never kissed a black girl before!\\" Diouana receives a letter from her mother, which Monsieur reads to her. Diouana's mother asks why she has not heard from her daughter, and asks for money. Diouana rips the letter up. Madame refuses to let Diouana sleep, and yells at her to get to work. Diouana attempts to take back the mask she gave to Madame, and a struggle ensues. Madame tells Diouana that, if she does not work, she cannot eat. Diouana refuses to work. Then, in an unexpected plot twist that is the climax of the film, Diouana commits suicide by slitting her throat in the bathtub of the family's home. The film ends with Monsieur journeying to Senegal to return Diouana's suitcase and mask to her family. He offers Diouana's mother money, but she is insulted and refuses it. As Monsieur leaves the village, the little boy with the mask runs along behind him, symbolizing how Monsieur is haunted by his own memories. Cast * Mbissine Thérèse Diop as Gomis Diouana * Anne- Marie Jelinek as Madame * Robert Fontaine as Monsieur * Momar Nar Sene as Diouana's boyfriend Themes This film addresses the effects of colonialism and racism in Africa and Europe. These themes are highlighted through the recurring appearance of an African mask that Diouana gives to her employers on her first day of work at the house in Dakar. They initially put the mask with other pieces of African Art and, later in France, the mask is hung alone on the white wall in the French couple's apartment. The mask has different meanings: * Mainly it represents Diouana; at the beginning, when she gives the mask to the French family, they put the mask between other native masks, as she is still in her homeland, surrounded by people that she knows and by a familiar environment. But when they move to France, the mask is alone on a white wall, like Diouana is alone in France, surrounded by white walls and white people. * Also, means those African people that have to move from their homeland to Europe to seek their fortune, questioning the mobility, the 'visual hegemony' and the uprooting, the colonial dynamics and its legacies.Ponzanesi, Sandra and Verena Berger. \\"Introduction: genres and tropes in postcolonial cinema(s) in Europe\\", Transnational Cinemas, Vol. 7, No. 2, 2016 * Another analogy between the mask and Africa, for example in the last scene, when the white man is followed by the kid wearing the mask, it represents the past of Africa that will always haunt its colonizers, but also means the uncertain future of Africa. * Furthermore, Diouana’s last act of defiance is very significant for the African status; Madame and Diouana are contending the mask as France, but more in general, Europe fought for its supremacy on African territories, but at the end the African territories during 20th century gained independence, as Diouana at the end of the fight got the mask. The mask is a symbol of unity and identity, but today for the non-Africans it is only a 'souvenir'. As the film progresses, Diouana is shown as becoming overly depressed and lonely. Each day, her African identity deteriorates as she is seen as nothing but a slave to the white man. Theorists have explained that placing any human being in an inferior position in the context of discourse causes great mental strain. Fanon argues that It causes both the mind and body to feel inferior causing the colonized to feel less like a human being.Rachael Langford, \\"Black and white in black and white: Identity and cinematography in Ousmane Sembène's La Noire de…/Black Girl (1966)\\", Studies in French Cinema 1, no. 1 (2001), 14. This is the exact experience Diouana has. The film portrays how colonialism can break down an individual’s whole mindset, and cause them to face personal damage on top of the destruction already being caused through colonialism. The concept of literacy is additionally a very valuable aspect of the portrayal of colonialism. Author Rachel Langford expresses its importance and the way Diouana’s identity is ripped from her. Due to her being illiterate, when a letter is sent to Diouana by her mother, Madame and Monsieur take it upon themselves to write Diouana’s response for her. While Diouana is suffering, Madame begins to express to her mother that she is having a lovely and fulfilling time in France. Diouana becomes enraged, stating that this is not her letter.Langford, \\"Black and white”, 20. This scenario is significant to the theme of colonialism as Diouana is not allowed to develop her own life and personality. It is created for her by the colonizer, while she has no say in the matter. The film shows the true damage that colonialism can cause an individual. In terms of its representation of racism, it is expressed through the relationship of Diouana and Madame. These characters represent the issue of power relations between Africa and the Western state.Langford, \\"Black and white”, 13. The beginning of the film shows a large group of women who wait on the side of the street every morning in hopes they will be hired by a white woman and taken to a Western European country. This simple scene immediately shows the power difference between the two states. Each of these women dreams of living a fantasy life when arriving in Europe, but are faced with a negative reality. When Diouana is hired and arrives in France, she discovers herself to be in isolation from the world around her and forced to face the issue of racism daily. Even when guests arrive at the house, she is put on show for all the white men and women. Due to the colour of her skin and her country of origin, she is seen as a product to be used, not a human to be cared for. The film highlights societal hierarchy and how race is used to create this division. It is expressed that the social order can only be upheld with the cooperation of both the exploiter and the exploited.Ania Loomba, “Situating Colonial and Postcolonial Studies”, Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 3rd ed. (London and New York: Routledge, 2015), 134. The only way to ensure the exploited is obliging is to break their spirit through breaking down their identity, specifically focusing on their race. This is a method used by many colonizers, and it is clearly visualized within this film. Significance In his 1997 book Movies as Politics, Jonathan Rosenbaum makes a case for Black Girl as the symbolic genesis of sub-Saharan African filmmaking, at least to the extent that the authorship belonged to a born and bred African. In addition, the film, being from the perspective of a Senegalese female, acts as a rare reflection of the voices of the colonized. While Senegal had gained independence in 1960 (before the film takes place), colonial oppression still thrives throughout the film. This is seen in the objectification of Diouana and the suppression of her dreams and ambitions. She is objectified by Madame, who treats her as a servant, and several other characters including Madame’s friend that kisses Diouana without asking. Her ambitions are suppressed by both Madame and Diouana’s lack of education and finances. Diouana dreams to go to the French shops, see the beautiful views, and live a luxurious lifestyle, but she does not have the resources to do so. She attempts to express some part of this dream by wearing dresses and heels while working; however, Madame yells at her to take off those clothes and reminds Diouana that she is a maid, so she has no need for such attire. In doing this, Madame suppresses Diouana’s dreams and hopes while asserting the inequality between their characters. To Diouana, France was supposed to be her chance at freedom, wealth, and happiness, and this dream was promised to her by Madame. Sembène reveals in his film that while Diouana (and the colonized) has the possibility right outside her door, quite literally, she will never be able to achieve her dreams due to the oppression of Madame (the colonizer) and the institutional discrimination embedded into society; and the colonizer offers this dream as a way to manipulate the colonized into being oppressed. Reception In The Cineaste, poet A. Van Jordan wrote of Diop's performance in Black Girl: \\"Diouana (Mbissine Thérèse Diop) is one of those characters you fall in love with as soon as they enter the story. Diop is one of those actors you want to stare at a couple of hours, easy. So this is an equation for emotional investment--if not unbridled infatuation, at least--woven into the writing and the casting.\\" Awards * 1966, Prix Jean Vigo for best feature film See also * Cinema of Senegal References External links At ousmanesembene.com *Introduction at Senses of Cinema *Slant Magazine review * *Black Girl: Self, Possessed an essay by Ashley Clark at the Criterion Collection 1966 films Senegalese films Films directed by Ousmane Sembène Films shot in Senegal French films French-language films Films set in Senegal Films set on the French Riviera French black-and-white films Senegalese black-and-white films Films about immigration to Europe ","title":"Black Girl (1966 film)"},{"id":"9753497","text":"John C. Sullivan (December 9, 1788 - July 27, 1830) was a surveyor who established the Indian Boundary Line and the Sullivan Line which were to form the boundary between Native Americans and white settlers in Indian Territory from Iowa to Texas. Following the Indian Removal Act in 1830 all Native Americans west of the Mississippi River and many east of the river were moved west of the Indian Boundary Line. In 1838 disputes over the Sullivan Line were to touch off the bloodless Honey War over the boundary between Missouri and Iowa. Background In the Treaty of Fort Clark in 1808, the Osage Nation, the most influential tribe in Missouri, ceded all lands west of Fort Clark near Sibley, Missouri in Jackson County, Missouri. In exchange for this, the tribe was paid merchandise worth $1,500 along with a fort to protect them and a government sanctioned trading post. Treaty of the Osage 1808 . The specific boundaries: :And in consideration of the advantages which we derive from the stipulations contained in the foregoing articles, we, the chiefs and warriors of the Great and Little Osage, for ourselves and our nations respectively, covenant and agree with the United States, that the boundary line between our nations and the United States shall be as follows, to wit: beginning at Fort Clark, on the Missouri, five miles above Fire Prairie, and running thence a due south course to the river Arkansas, and down the same to the Mississippi; hereby ceding and relinquishing forever to the United States, all the lands which lie east of the said line, and north of the southwardly bank of the said river Arkansas, and all lands situated northwardly of the river Missouri. And we do further cede and relinquish to the United States forever, a tract of two leagues square, to embrace fort Clark, and to be laid off in such manner as the President of the United States shall think proper. The treaty provided the following provision: :And it is mutually agreed by the contracting parties, that the boundary lines hereby established, shall be run and marked at the expense of the United States, as soon as circumstances or their convenience will permit; and the Great and Little Osage promise to depute two chiefs from each of their respective nations, to accompany the commissioner, or commissioners who may be appointed on the part of the United States, to settle and adjust the said boundary line.  Indian Boundary Line  In 1816 the boundary was \\"adjusted\\" west to the mouth of the Kansas River on the Missouri River which was a more significant geographic boundary than Fire Prairie Creek. Although no treaties were in place acknowledging the new line, the United States began to survey the new boundary line to which all were to be removed. Sullivan was instructed to run by his boss William Rector, head of the survey agency for Missouri and Illinois territories to draw a line north from the mouth of the Kansas River and thence east and 40 chains to the Des Moines River.The Mapping of Missouri By Arthur Winslow - 1892 - pp80-81 Sullivan was to be criticized later for not extending the line all the way to the similarly named (but different) Des Moines Rapids on the Mississippi River at about the latitude of Fort Madison, Iowa. Sullivan was to begin his survey on the \\"far bank\\" of the confluence on the Left Bank of the Missouri at what is now the Clay County, Missouri and Platte County, Missouri line at what is now property owned by Kansas City Downtown Airport. The mark that now forms the Iowa-Missouri border was placed just north of Sheridan, Missouri. Joseph C. Brown in 1823 survey the boundary south to the Arkansas boundary. From Arkansas it has a small eastward angle to the Arkansas River at Fort Smith, Arkansas where it then heads due south before briefly following the Red River of the South to the Texas border. The line now forms the border between Missouri and Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, and Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Sullivan Line  Sullivan drifted northward by 2 degrees as he headed east to the Des Moines which he described as shallow and calm when he crossed it at just south of Farmington, Iowa. Sullivan was a delegate to the Missouri Constitutional Convention that defined the state's borders. The initial proposal for the boundaries of Missouri were close to the boundaries of today and followed the original Osage territory. There was a debate about extending the northern border further north to the mouth of the Rock River (Illinois) at Rock Island, Illinois and the western boundary further west to the mouth of the Wolf River (Kansas) at White Cloud, Kansas. The additions would have made Missouri the largest state in the Union and under Congressional pressure it was dropped back to the current configuration since the lines were already marked (plus the addition of the Bootheel to accommodate the wishes of Mississippi River towns to stay with their Missouri compatriots.A History of Missouri by Louis Houck - 1908 The state's official description was: :Beginning in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the parallel of thirty- six degrees of north latitude; thence west along the said parallel of latitude to the St. Francois River; thence up and following the course of that river, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the parallel of latitude of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes; thence west along the same to a point where the said parallel is intersected by a meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas River, where the same empties into the Missouri River; thence, from the point aforesaid, north along the said meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the River Des Moines, making said line correspond with the Indian boundary-line; thence east from the point of intersection last aforesaid, along the said parallel of latitude, to the middle of the channel of the main fork of the said River Des Moines; thence down along the middle of the main channel of the said River Des Moines to the mouth of the same, where it empties into the Mississippi River; thence due east to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River; thence down and following the course of the Mississippi River, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the place of beginning.STATE OF MISSOURI v. STATE OF IOWA, 48 U.S. 660 (1849) The wording in the Constitution of \\"north along the said meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the River Des Moines, making said line correspond with the Indian boundary- line\\" was to stir problems later since Sullivan had not crossed any rapids while a set of rapids on the Mississippi River called the Des Moines Rapids defined the northern navigational end of the Mississippi which was deep in the rapids. In 1824, treaties for the Ioway, Sac and Fox ceding their land in Missouri implied that the Sullivan Line was Missouri's northern border all the way to the Mississippi. :The Ioway Tribe or Nation of Indians by their deputies, Ma-hos-kah, (or White Cloud,) and Mah-ne-hah-nah, (or Great Walker,) in Council assembled, do hereby agree, in consideration of a certain sum of money, &c.; to be paid to the said Ioway Tribe, by the government of the United States, as hereinafter stipulated, to cede and forever, quit claim, and do, in behalf of their said Tribe, hereby cede, relinquish, and forever quit claim, unto the United States, all right, title, interest, and claim, to the lands which the said Ioway Tribe have, or claim, within the State of Missouri, and situated between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and a line running from the Missouri, at the mouth or entrance of Kanzas river, north one hundred miles, to the northwest corner of the limits of the state of Missouri, and, from thence, east to the Mississippi.Treaty With the Iowa, 1824 Missouri did not formally move to claim the land south of the Sullivan Line to the mouth of the Des Moines at Keokuk, Iowa became known as Half Breed Tract and was declared part of Iowa when it joined the Union in 1846. Since it is south of the Sullivan Line it is the southernmost point in Iowa. Honey War After Sullivan died in 1830, the Sullivan Line was extended in the west to the Missouri River in 1836 as the U.S. government in the Platte Purchase bought all the land west from the Indian Boundary Line and then permitted Missouri to annex the land. As part of the purchase, Missouri wanted the Sullivan Line resurveyed. Joseph C. Brown who was involved with establishing the Fifth Principal Meridian from which most of land in the Louisiana Territory was mapped was hired by Missouri to resurvey the land. Brown was to say that instead of using the mouth of the Kansas, the northern should have been determined by its relation to the mouth of Ohio River. Brown said the border should be north of the Sullivan Line at what is now Lacey-Keosauqua State Park in Keosauqua, Iowa. Brown's Line was not recognized by Iowa. Missouri sent Clark County, Missouri sheriff to collect taxes in the strip and was arrested. According to legend Missouri tax collectors cut down three trees that had honey bee hives to collect honey in lieu of taxes. State militias from both Missouri and Iowa were called out before the governors eventually agreed to let the Supreme Court decide the case which it did in State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660 (1849), upholding the Sullivan Line noting that is how it was written in state's constitution. The line was resurveyed to correct various jogs as disputes were to continue over the line into the 20th century. Illinois and Michigan Canal In addition to his surveys in Missouri, Sullivan also surveyed a strip of land on either side of the Chicago River extending from Lake Michigan to the Fox River (Illinois River tributary). This was to ultimately clear the way for the Illinois and Michigan Canal and eventually the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal connecting Lake Michigan, Chicago, Illinois to the Illinois River and ultimately the Mississippi. The survey done in 1818-1819 on land ceded by the Sac and Fox in the Treaty of St. Louis. The survey resulted in several streets in Chicago having a diagonal that is at odds with the city's grid pattern.Early Chicago Encyclopedia References People from Missouri 1830 deaths American surveyors 1788 births ","title":"John C.

There are two historical figures who may have provided the basis for this legend. The first was a French penitent of the same name who went on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in the thirteenth century. On his return journey, he established himself at Burgos, where he founded a hospital for lepers. Saint Amaro has also been identified with Saint Maurus, disciple of Saint Benedict, who founded the first Benedictine monastery in France. Around the historical character of Saint Amaro converged many pagan traditions present in Asturias and Galicia related with Gaelic immrama and echtrai, like the voyages of Mael Dúin, the Úi Chorra, Snegdus and Mac Riagla or Bran mac Febal. Many features of the Celtic Otherworld are present in the Periplus of Saint Amaro. The Periplus of Amaro Like Saint Brendan, Amaro is said to have travelled on a journey that echoes that of the Irish immram – the voyages to the paradisiacal islands of the West. An edition of the Life of Saint Amaro was published at Burgos in 1552.Its full title was The Life of the Blessed Saint Amaro and of the Dangers that He Encountered Until He Reached the Earthly Paradise. See His legend holds that Amaro was a noble Catholic from Asia who was obsessed with the idea of visiting the earthly paradise. With this goal in mind, he would inquire for more information from his guests. Amaro was not successful in receiving information from them and was quite desperate and anguished about this until one night, God appeared to him and revealed how to reach his objective. Amaro would have to build a boat and follow the path of the sun across the Atlantic Ocean. Amaro took to the sea with some companions and sailed for six days and seven nights until he reached an island. This was an extremely fertile land that was blessed with five cities inhabited by uncouth men – though the women were quite beautiful. Amaro spent six months there until he heard a voice in his dreams telling him to depart the island. Amaro sailed through the \\"Red Sea\\" until he reached the land of a beautiful fountain, where the people were beautiful and lived peaceful lives that lasted three hundred years. Amaro remained there for three weeks until an old woman advised that he leave the island before he became accustomed to the good life. Sunset in the Western Galicia coast.They sailed for a long time into the vast unknown until they saw several vessels that they thought could assist them. Unfortunately, they found that these vessels had been invaded by monsters, which had killed the sailors and taken their bodies down to the depths of the ocean. Amaro was rescued by an apparition of a group of women, who advised him to empty his bottles of wine and oil into the sea, and then fill the bottles with air. Amaro did this and was rescued from this \\"Mar Cuajado\\" (lit. \\"Still Sea\\"; the Doldrums). Three days later they arrived at another desert island, which was inhabited by savage beasts hostile to man. There they found a hermit who informed them that the beasts there annihilated themselves by fighting one another on the day of Saint John; the stench of the corpses persisted throughout the year. The hermit provided them with supplies and recommended that they sail East, where there was a beautiful land that would satisfy all of their needs. They sailed the next day and arrived in the afternoon, finding a monastery named Valdeflores. A monk from this monastery, Leonites, greeted them and told Amaro that he was waiting for him: he was already informed of their arrival by means of a vision. Leonites provided Amaro with instructions on how to reach the Earthly Paradise. With Leonites, Amaro and his companions arrived at a natural harbor where they remained for a month, after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley, where Amaro will find what he was looking for: the Earthly Paradise. First, however, Amaro stumbled upon a nunnery situated high upon a mountaintop called Flor de Dueñas (Flower of Ladies). He remained there, receiving further instructions on how to reach Paradise from a holy woman named Baralides. He is presented with a white habit. This is given to him by Brígida (Bridget), the niece of Baralides who lives in Paradise. Unfortunately, Leonites began to cry: he is losing a dear friend. But Baralides appears, and comforts Leonites with a gift. She presents him with a branch of one of the two magical trees of the Earthly Paradise. Amaro in Paradise In Paradise, Amaro found an enormous castle built from gems and precious metals, with battlements of gold and towers of rubies, walls made with multicolored bricks. The castle’s gatekeeper informed Amaro that the castle was the Earthly Paradise, and thus no living being can enter it. The saint begged the gatekeeper to allow him to look at Paradise through the keyhole. Amaro was allowed to do this, and saw many things, including the tree of life from which Adam ate; a primeval and eternal garden; enormous trees; birds whose song was so beautiful one could remain entranced by it for a thousand years; young musicians playing strange and unknown musical instruments; beautiful ladies adorned with a crown of flowers and dressed in white; the Virgin Mary, who accompanied these young ladies. Saint Amaro begged to be allowed in; the gatekeeper refused and informed him that during the saint's viewing of Paradise, three hundred years have passed. Amaro returned to the coast to find his companions gone and a city named after him built there. Amaro told the city’s inhabitants his story and they built him a house alongside the monastery of Valdeflores, where he lived for a number of years until he died. He was buried alongside Baralides and Brígida. Veneration Ermita de San Amaro, Puerto de la Cruz. There are a number of hermitages dedicated to Amaro in Spain. There is a hermitage dedicated to Amaro in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife (Ermita de San Amaro). The town of San Amaro in Ourense province is named after him. His cult was also diffused in Portugal, where he is called Santo Amaro. In the districts of Coimbra and Viseu, Saint Amaro is brought pinecones, nuts, and dry figs as an ex-voto offering — but he only accepts these items if they have been stolen. Saint Matthew, Saint Simon, and Saint Bartholomew are also brought things that have been stolen. He is also venerated with an annual religious festival in the parish of Ponta Delgada. At Beja, the whitewashed church of Santo Amaro is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the seventh century.

It is featured prominently in the 1973 Woody Allen sci-fi comedy Sleeper. Background Architect Charles Deaton has described his inspiration for the house: \\"On Genesee Mountain I found a high point of land where I could stand and feel the great reaches of the Earth. I wanted the shape of it to sing an unencumbered song.\\" Construction The Deaton-designed house was built in 1963. Delzell Inc., owned and operated by Clifford M. Delzell, was the original builder of the house on an experimental permit. Deaton ran out of money before the house was finished, so it was never inhabited by the designer. The interior of the Sculptured House went largely unfinished and was vacant for almost three decades. Deaton died in 1996. In 1999, entrepreneur and one-time Denver economic-development chief John Huggins purchased the house. He built a large addition designed by Deaton with Nick Antonopoulos. Huggins commissioned Deaton's daughter Charlee to design the interior, and it was completed in 2003. The house covers over five levels, with five bedrooms and five bathrooms, along with a state of the art kitchen and top level master suite. In 2006, fellow Denver entrepreneur Michael Dunahay purchased the house from Huggins. By late 2010, Dunahay had become delinquent on the nearly $2.8 million outstanding balance of his $3.1 million mortgage on the house, and the Public Trustee in Jefferson County, Colorado scheduled a foreclosure auction for November 10, 2010, where it was sold for $1.5 million.

It amended the regime established under the Licensing Act 1737 for the licensing of the theatre in Great Britain, implementing the proposals made by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1832. Under the Licensing Act 1737 (10 Geo.II, c. 28), the Lord Chamberlain was granted the ability to vet the performance of any new plays: he could prevent any new play, or any modification to an existing play, from being performed for any reason, and was not required to justify his decision. New plays were required to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain for a licence before they could be performed, and theatre owners could be prosecuted for staging a play (or part of a play) that had not received prior approval. A licence, once granted, could be also withdrawn. The Licensing Act 1737 also limited spoken drama to the patent theatres, originally only the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in London. The regime was relaxed slightly by the Theatrical Representations Act 1788, under which local magistrates were permitted to license occasional performances for periods of up to 60 days. The Theatres Act 1843 restricted the powers of the Lord Chamberlain, so that he could only prohibit the performance of plays where he was of the opinion that \\"it is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum or of the public peace so to do\\". It also gave additional powers to local authorities to license theatres, breaking the monopoly of the patent theatres and encouraging the development of popular theatrical entertainments, such as saloon theatres attached to public houses and music halls. The regime established by the 1843 Act was considered by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1866, and two Parliamentary Joint Select committees, in 1909 and then in 1966, and various reforms were proposed, but no changes were implemented until the Act was finally repealed by the Theatres Act 1968.

Serjeant John Hoskins or Hoskyns (1 March 1566 – 27 August 1638) was an English poet, scholar of Greek, lawyer, judge and politician. Life He was the son of John and Margery Hoskins born in Mownton-upon-Wye, Llanwarne, Herefordshire. His father, impressed by his memory and mental abilities, arranged for him to be taught Greek at the age of ten. He attended Westminster School for a year before going to Winchester College in 1579. From 1584 to 1588 he attended their sister foundation New College, Oxford, arriving alongside Henry Wotton. Hoskins was expelled from Oxford University before he became Regent master: the authorities did not appreciate his biting satire. He became a teacher in Ilchester, Somerset, where he worked on a Greek lexicon which went as far as the letter M. Through a fortuitous meeting with Benedicta Moyle, who later became his first wife, he then gained entrance to the Middle Temple to study for the bar. History of Parliament Online article. Hoskins by 1601 acquired a house in, and was elected to parliament for Hereford in 1604 and 1614. In 1614, in parliament, he spoke his mind about the Sicilian Vespers and consequently was imprisoned for a year in the Tower of London with Sir Charles Cornwallis. After his release he was elected Lent Reader in 1619, and became a Judge in 1623. He was re-elected MP for Hereford in 1628. Hoskins was an intimate of John Selden, Sir Walter Raleigh and Ben Jonson. He fought a duel with Sir Benjamin Rudyard, but they subsequently became great friends. When he was a Serjeant-at-law, and was indicted for not keeping the pavement in front of his door in good repair, he successfully defended his case arguing that the charge did not specify how he was liable, whether he owned a property at that location, whether he lived there, or even whether he had a tenant who had legally assumed such responsibilities. Personal life Self portrait of John Hoskins among his family, probably sketched late in July 1618. Depicted are himself, his step-son, step-daughter, and wife.Whitlock 1982, p. 534 Hoskins was twice married. His first wife was Benedicta Moyle, daughter of John Moyle, of Buckwell, Kent. They met before he became a law student but did not marry until 1 August 1601, when she had in the meantime married Francis Bourne (a fellow barrister) of Sutton St Clere, Somerset, who had died in February 1601. The couple had three sons (two of whom predeceased him) and one daughter. Benedicta died on 6 October 1625. His second wife, whom he married on 10 December 1627, was Isabel, daughter of William Riseley of Chetwode, Buckinghamshire, and successively widow of Thomas Heath, of Shellswell, Oxfordshire, and of Devereux Barratt of Tenby, Pembrokeshire. The couple had no children. Death Early in 1638, when attending assizes, \\"a massive country fellow trod on his toe\\"; gangrene set in but, despite an amputation, he died in August that year, aged 72. He is buried in Abbey Dore, Herefordshire. His surviving son Bennet Hoskyns was created a Baronet in 1676. Works The poem Absence, Hear thou my Protestation (Printed anonymously in Francis Davison's A poetical rhapsody containing diverse sonnets, odes, [etc.] (V. S. for J. Baily, 1602)) was at one time attributed to John Donne.

It is based on Giancarlo De Cataldo's 2002 novel, which is in turn inspired by the Banda della Magliana true story. The Magliana gang was one of the most powerful Italian criminal associations, dominating Rome's drug, gambling and other kinds of crime activities from the early 1970s to 1992 (death of Enrico De Pedis). The gang's affiliates start their career kidnapping rich people, drug dealing (hashish, cocaine, heroin, etc.) from the 1970s they started working with the Italian secret service, fascists, terrorists, the Sicilian Mafia, Camorra and many more. Some gang members are still alive, as inmates of an Italian prison, or justice collaborators. The film is something of a showcase for a number of Italy's leading young film and television actors, notably Favino, who won a Donatello award for his performance as Lebanese. In 2008 a spin-off TV series commenced broadcasting (Romanzo criminale – La serie). Plot In 1970s Rome, four young delinquents, nicknamed Ice, Lebanese, Dandi and Grand steal a car. Crashing through a police road block, the driver, Grand is crushed by the steering column. Back at their hideout, a small disused caravan near a beach, they are discovered by the police. Cold, Lebanese and Dandi run away, but are captured. Grand, who is mortally wounded, dies in the caravan. Roll opening credits. Some years later, in the 1970s, Ice is released from prison and joins up with Lebanese, who tells him he has come up with a plan to kidnap and hold to ransom Baron Rossellini, a wealthy aristocrat for whom Lebanese's parents worked. He has formed a gang with Dandi - they are Black, Bright Eye, Ricotta, Bufalo, Rat and Ciro and Aldo Buffoni. After negotiating the ransom of 3 billion lire, the Baron is shot by one of the Cannizzari brothers who have been entrusted by Lebanese to guard him. Nonetheless, they take a picture of the dead man with a newspaper and get the 3 billion lire. However, the local Police Commissioner Nicola Scialoja manages to record the serial numbers of the ransom money before the gang receives it, setting out to capture the gang. As the gang divide up the money, Lebanese proposes to split 500 million lire between them, and use the remaining 2.5 billion to build a foothold in the criminal underworld of Rome, starting with drug dealing. However, the drugs racket is owned by the dealer Terrible, and so the gang wipe his gang out apart from Gemito, who Lebanese bribes to help them. After his home is raided and his body guards killed, Terrible wakes to find Ice, Lebanese and Dandi in his bedroom. Cornered, he reluctantly agrees to let give control of the racket to the gang. The gang grows in influence and ambition. Rome falls under their rule, and the rule of Lebanese. Dandi meets and becomes enamoured with an upmarket prostitute, Patrizia, who, in order to be kept under the sway of the gang and in order to prevent Dandi becoming involved in brawls provoked by his jealousy, is bought over and given a brothel. Ice, meanwhile falls in love with his younger brother Gigio's tutor, Roberta. However, Lebanese begins to consider Ice's romance a weakness, a point reinforced when Ice asks to be dismissed from the gang. In response, Lebanese casts up the car theft from their childhood, where his leg was permanently damaged by the pursuing police. Cold and Roberta begin to learn English with the idea that they will elope. However, when Ice is at the Bologna Train Station, there was an organized bombing, representing the state collusion. Later, Ice receives a phone call informing him that Lebanese is dead, stabbed by Gemito after a bitter game of poker. Then begins Ice's quest for vengeance, aided by Dandi. Yet Scialoja is on their trail and succeeds in capturing Ice, then the other members of the gang except Dandi. Ice plans to escape from prison with the help of his friends, but a deadly spiral of score settling has already begun to coil around them all.

Boyle was born in Castlemartyr, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Boyle (1648–1693), second son of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery and Lady Margaret Howard. His mother was Lady Mary O'Brien, daughter of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin and Elizabeth St. Leger. His father died during the Flanders campaign of 1693. On the death of Henry's eldest brother Roger in 1705 he succeeded to the family estates at Castlemartyr, which he found to be in a state of serious neglect. Henry did much to improve the estate and Castlemartyr village. He also managed the County Cork estates of his second wife's father, Lord Burlington, and proved himself an excellent steward of the family property. In 1707, he was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Midleton, a seat he held until 1713, and then sat for Kilmallock from 1713 to 1715. Between 1715 and 1756 he represented County Cork. He quickly gained a prominent role in Parliament and Sir Robert Walpole is said to have styled him \\"the King of the Irish House of Commons\\". In 1733 Boyle was admitted to the Irish House of Commons and appointed Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer. Later that year he was also made Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. His career was marked by a long struggle for power with George Stone, Archbishop of Armagh, which only ended with their deaths in the same week. He deserves some credit for helping to organise measures to alleviate the terrible Irish Famine (1740–41) which was long remembered as \\"the year of slaughter\\". He held the posts of Speaker and Chancellor until 1753, when he was dismissed by the viceroy Lord Dorset for refusing to pay over an Irish tax surplus to the government in London. This led to the \\"Money Bill dispute\\" of 1753-56, and Boyle came to be seen as an early Irish patriot. Reinstated in 1755 by Devonshire, the next viceroy, in 1756 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Castle Martyr, Viscount Boyle, of Bandon, and Earl of Shannon. He also acted several times as Lord Justice of Ireland. Horace Walpole dismissed him as a \\"common character\\" who sold his patriotism for a peerage. Family Lord Shannon married Catherine Coote, daughter of Colonel Chidley Coote of Kilmallock and Catherine Sandys, in 1715. They had no issue. After her death in 1725, he married Lady Henrietta Boyle, youngest daughter of Charles Boyle, 3rd Earl of Cork and 2nd Earl of Burlington and Juliana Noel, in 1726. Lord Shannon died in December 1764, in his 82nd year, and was succeeded in his titles by his son from his second marriage, Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon.

However, shortly after demolition works to the old Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange, the old contractor went bust, thus the site remained abandoned for two years. Meanwhile, the Singapore Labour Foundation (the then owner of AMK Hub) made changes to the proposed development, from a mixed used development to a small shopping complex, which will host a hypermarket, a new air-conditioned bus interchange, an 8-screen cinema, and more than 100 specialty shops.

Anatomically it is considered the smaller portion of the reticulorumen along with the rumen. Together these two compartments make up 84% of the volume of the total stomach. The rumen is located at the base of the esophagus. The reticulum is colloquially referred to as the honeycomb. It is also known as the bonnetThe Chambers Dictionary, Ninth Edition, Chambers Harrap Publishers, 2003 and as the kings-hood. When cleaned and used for food, it is called \\"tripe\\". Heavy or dense feed and foreign objects will settle here. It is the site of hardware disease in cattle and because of the proximity to the heart this disease can be life-threatening.  Anatomy  The internal mucosa has a honeycomb shape. When looking at the reticulum with ultrasonography it is a crescent shaped structure with a smooth contour.[Braun, U., and D. Jacquat. 2011. Ultrasonography of the reticulum in 30 healthy Saanen goats. Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 53:19] The reticulum is adjacent to the diaphragm, lungs, abomasum, rumen and liver. The heights of the reticular crests and depth of the structures vary across ruminant animal species.[Clauss, M., Hofmann, R. R., Streich, W. J., Fickel, J., and Hummel, J. 2009. Convergence in the macroscopic anatomy of the reticulum in wild ruminant species of different feeding types and a new resulting hypothesis on reticular function. Journal of Zoology. 281:26-38.] Grazing ruminants have higher crests than browsers. However, general reticulum size is fairly constant across ruminants of differing body size and feeding type. In a mature cow, the reticulum can hold around 5 gallons of liquid. The rumen and reticulum are very close in structure and function and can be considered as one organ. They are separated only by a muscular fold of tissue. In immature ruminants a reticular groove is formed by the muscular fold of the reticulum. This allows milk to pass by the reticulorumen straight into the abomasum.  Role in digestion  The fluid contents of the reticulum play a role in particle separation. This is true both in domestic and wild ruminants. The separation takes place through biphasic contractions. In the first contraction there is sending large particles back into the rumen while the reticulo-omasal orifice allows the passage of finer particles. In the second contraction the reticulum contracts completely so the empty reticulum can refill with contents from the rumen. These contents are then sorted in the next biphasic contraction. The contractions occur in regular intervals. High density particles may settle into the honeycomb structures and can be found after death.

Overview An Opal release, with no catalogue number, this title is only available from EnoShop. The music on the album is taken from an installation—a show featuring music and visuals—that took place at the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland, from 11 December 1999 to 6 February 2000. The installation included a generative music system and a collection of objects chosen for their spatial presence - stones, sand and light sculptures. The original music was composed of eight layers of sound, each one playing on a CD player situated somewhere in the gallery, the sounds from which were all looped, providing an almost infinite variety of sonic possibilities. The music on the CD, at only half an hour in length, is a very much curtailed version of something that lasted for two months. Eno made the music in his studios in London. He said \\"I think of shows like this as 'music in more dimensions' or perhaps 'music for more senses' .... a process more similar to painting or collage than conventional music composition. One element in it is nearly 20 years old; most of it was made last week. The music is divided into 8 independent layers, one of which is playing on each CD player. Since these players are not synchronized, the music constantly recombines into different patterns\\".

Background Beauport was built starting in 1908 as the summer home of interior decorator and antique collector Henry Davis Sleeper. Situated on the rocks overlooking Gloucester Harbor, the structure was repeatedly enlarged and modified by Sleeper, and filled with a large collection of fine art, folk art, architectural artifacts, and other collectible materials. Sleeper decorated its rooms, which came to number 56, to evoke different historical and literary themes. After his death, Charles and Helena Woolworth McCann acquired the house and its contents. They preserved much of the Sleeper's designs and decorations, but made some modifications, including adding their porcelain collection to the house. Their heirs donated the property to the Society for the Protection of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England) in 1947, who operate the property as a house museum. Beauport served as Sleeper's escape, a backdrop for summer parties, and as a showcase for his professional skills. The house has frequently been written about in books and magazines, with the first major article appearing in House Beautiful in 1916. It has been featured in such diverse publications as Architectural Digest, Country Living, and The Boston Globe, and has been showcased on television programs such as America's Castles. Preservation Beauport was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2003, in recognition for its distinctive architecture, its unique collection of artifacts, and for its association for Sleeper, whose design influence extended across the wealthy elite of the eastern United States.Timothy T. Orwig, Carolyn Pitts, and Patty Henry (2001-08-31) , National Park Service (including maps and plans and In addition to the main house, the property also has a gate house, garage, and toolshed that were built by Sleeper. The gate house has been adapted by Historic New England as a visitor reception area, and the toolshed now houses restrooms. The garage is used for storage and as office space. There is a single non-contributing building on the property, a caretaker's house, which is potentially of local historic interest as an example of a prefabricated post-World War II residential structure.

It is now owned by Historic New England and is open to visitors Wednesday - Sunday, June 1 – October 15. History Judge Silas Lee built this 1807 Regency-style mansion at the peak of Wiscasset's prosperity, when the town was the busiest port east of Boston. Lee's death in 1814, combined with the cumulative financial impact of Jefferson's Embargo of 1807, forced his widow to sell it. The house passed through a succession of hands until 1858, when Captain Richard H. Tucker, Jr. scion of a Wiscasset shipping family, bought the property. Captain Tucker, his young wife, Mollie and their new baby moved into the house in November 1858. The Tuckers updated the interiors and added a new Italianate entrance to the Lee Street side of the house. In 1859, he added a dramatic two-story porch to what had been the front of the house facing the Sheepscot River. The couple raised five children here. Captain Tucker oversaw various business ventures including wharves and an iron foundry just below the house. However, by the 1880s, expenses had far exceeded income. Mollie began accepting boarders in the summers to help cover the expenses. She and their youngest daughter, Jane, also turned to the sale of home-baked goods, hand- painted china and raising squab for local restaurants to raise much needed cash. After Captain Tucker's death, Jane returned to live in the house full- time with Mollie. The women helped preserve the house until Mollie's death in 1922 and Jane's death in 1964. Her niece, Jane Standen Tucker, moved to Wiscasset from California to preserve the house and all its contents, making very few changes to the decorating schemes. Their dedication preserved Castle Tucker as it was in the late 19th and early 20th century. The house is now owned by Historic New England and is open to visitors Wednesday - Sunday, June 1 – October 15.

Pole Fitness Controversy In October 2013 Swansea Students' Union Societies & Services Officer Ceinwen Cloney banned the University's Pole Fitness society, citing \\"sexist attitudes\\" following a motion to the Trustee Board by external Trustee Ali Morris. They listed among their reasoning that \\"Pole fitness and pole dancing are a direct spin off from lap dancing [...] We should not be deaf to the very real issue of pole fitness playing a part in upholding this raunch culture and objectification of women and girls and the impact of this on our female students [...] Evidence shows that young women aged 16 to 24 are the group of women who experience the most domestic and sexual violence. This is the age of a large group of our female students. We believe that activities such as 'pole fitness' contributes to an atmosphere where women are viewed as sexual objects and where violence against them is acceptable.\\" The decision has sparked a significant backlash in social media and news sites. The Union U-turned on their original policy and the society was fully reinstated.

KBOI airs news/talk programming. Studios are located on Bannock Street in downtown Boise, while it transmits from a six-tower facility southeast of Nampa. KBOI is Idaho's most powerful AM station, broadcasting with 50,000 watts around the clock. During the day, a single tower beams the station's full power to southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon by day. At night, power is fed to all six towers in a directional pattern to avoid interfering with WSCR in Chicago, the Clear-channel station on 670 kHz. Even though it must direct its signal north-south as a result, KBOI can still be heard across most of western North America at night. Because of this, KBOI is Idaho's designated primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. KBOI is licensed by the FCC to broadcast in the HD (hybrid digital) format, although it currently does not have HD turned on as of 7 March 2018.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=51211 Programming The KBOI morning show, \\"Idaho's First Morning News/Idaho Talks Live\\" was anchored by Paul J. Schneider and Chris Walton until December, 2018, when Schneider retired from full-time broadcasting after 51 years with KBOI-TV and KBOI-AM. Schneider, an Illinois native who moved to Idaho as a teen with his parents and brother, was a KBOI-AM morning host from 1976 to 2018. Walton, a native of Twin Falls, joined the program in 2001, moving from the morning drive show at Citadel-owned classic rock station KKGL-FM. Idaho native Mike Kasper, the former morning drive co-host of Boise station KCIX-FM, was hired by KBOI following Schneider's retirement, and since January, 2019, the 5am-10am KBOI-AM program has been known as \\"Kasper and Chris\\". The KBOI morning newscaster is station news director Rick Worthington. The radio program was simulcast on then-local Fox television station KTRV-TV from 8am to 10am Monday through Friday from 2003 through 2010. KTRV dropped the program after Boise CBS affiliate television station KBCI-TV changed its call letters back to KBOI-TV in 2010 (after spending the last 35 years as KBCI-TV) to reflect a renewed partnership with KBOI radio. KBOI's 3pm-6pm afternoon drive slot is held by Boise talk show host Nate Shelman, who also serves as the station's program director. The station also features syndicated weekday shows including Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, John Batchelor and Red Eye Radio. Except for Limbaugh, all the national shows heard on KBOI come from Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media; Limbaugh is syndicated by Premiere Networks. Weekends on KBOI include shows on money, real estate, home improvement, and gardening, as well as religious and Brokered programming.

Biography  Walter Sherman Gifford was born in Salem, Massachusetts on January 10, 1885. He graduated from Harvard University in 1905. In July 1906 he joined the Western Electric Company in Chicago as Assistant Secretary and Treasurer. In 1911 Gifford left Western Electric, went to Arizona in a copper mining venture that he tired of after six months. However, Theodore N. Vail hired him as Chief statistician for American Telephone & Telegraph in New York.John Brooks (1976) Telephone: The First Hundred Years, p 169, Harper & Row In 1916 he was called to national service during World War I. During the war he became Supervising Director of the Committee on Industrial Preparedness of the National Consulting Board, Director of the Council of National Defense and Advisory Commission, and Secretary of the U. S. Representation on the Inter-Allied Munitions Council. After the war he returned to AT&T; and soon became a Vice President. In 1925, at age 40, he became the president of the AT&T; Corporation when the existing president Harry Bates Thayer was made chairman of the board of directors. That same year he established the Bell Telephone Laboratories as a separate entity which would take over the work being conducted by Western Electric's engineering department's research division. According to one historian, :One of Gifford’s most brilliant early staff appointments was that of Arthur W. Page to the job of vice-president for public relations. ... Gifford persuaded him to join AT&T; early in 1927.Brooks 1976 p 173 Gifford had a video telephone conversation in 1927 with Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, through AT&T;'s pioneering technology in television transmission over wire. He was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1943. During Gifford's presidency lasting 23 years, AT&T; experienced tremendous growth. Gifford increased operating revenue from $657 million to $2.25 billion. In 1927, Gifford relaunched his firm's overseas operations and by 1948, 72 foreign countries were linked by wire and radio with AT&T; lines. In 1950, he retired from the post of chairman of AT&T; which he occupied from 1948-1950. By then he had served AT&T; for 45 years.  Other information  Kenneth Bilby (1986) tells of Gifford's courage in business: :..despite his conservative orthodoxy, there were elements of daring in Gifford's character, and he was innovative in corporate finance. In 1919, when utility bond issues were not in great favor in Wall Street, he persuaded his management to go directly to market with a $90-million offering of its own securities. It was a gargantuan sum at the time, larger than any ever raised without the underwriting support of investment bankers. But the over-the-counter offer was quickly subscribed, and AT&T; received the full amount without payment of large brokerage commissions.Kenneth Bilby (1988) The General, page 71, Harper & Row In 1922 Gifford became one of the founding trustees of the Grand Central Art Galleries, an artists' cooperative established that year by John Singer Sargent, Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others.\\"Painters and Sculptors' Gallery Association to Begin Work,\\" New York Times, December 19, 1922 Also on the board were the Galleries' architect, William Adams Delano; Robert W.

In 1937, the Littles purchased this farm, including its 18th-century farmhouse with views of the Essex River, as a family retreat and place to entertain. They named it Cogswell's Grant, after John Cogswell, who was the first English colonial owner of the property, which includes about of land. They carefully restored the farmhouse, trying to preserve original 18th-century finishes and carefully documenting their work, and decorated from their extensive collection of artifacts. In more than 50 years of collecting, they sought works of strong, even quirky character, and in particular favored objects with their original finishes and New England histories. They decorated the house for visual delight rather than historical accuracy.

The National Philharmonic of Ukraine (), often referred to as Kyiv Philharmonic and National Philharmonic, is a complex of two adjacent concert halls in the Khrestchaty Park in Kyiv, Ukraine. Formerly the Merchant's House, the building's use for musical performances is associated with the Philharmonic Society, established by Mykola Lysenko. The historic building was built at the end of the 19th century. Standing at the end of Khreschatyk street near the European Square, it has hosted numerous Russian composers such as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and famous opera singers like Leonid Sobinov and Feodor Chaliapin.  History  = The Merchant's House = At the end of the nineteenth century, Kyiv, at the time the leading commercial center in the south-west of the Russian Empire, flourished in its cultural development. In 1881, the Council of Elders of the Kyiv Merchants Assembly acquired permission to establish a recreational area in the Tsarskaya (Tsar’s) Square (now the European Square) where a year later a brick building decorated with towers and metal eaves was erected by the famous Kyiv architect Vladimir NikolayevКиїв. Історична енциклопедія. З найдавніших часів до 1917 року. and named the Merchants' House (Merchants' Assembly). The building rapidly gained recognition among Kyiv residents and became the center for cultural gatherings where society held masquerade balls, science and political conferences, charitable lotteries, and literary evenings. Because of the building's good acoustics the Merchants' House became popular for musical performances. The history of the Merchants' House has been greatly affected by the Ukrainian composer, pianist and conductor Mykola Lysenko. As one of the founders of the Philharmonic Society, Ukrainian Club, and Ukrainian School of Music, Lysenko was elected to the directorate board of the Merchants' House and brought the music of many Russian and European composers to the citizens of Kyiv. After the Russian Revolution the building underwent a big change in its purpose and accommodated the Proletarian House of Arts, converted to the House of Political Education, and later to the Bolshevik Club and Republican Palace of Pioneers. The Merchant's Assembly ceased to exist in 1919. In 1927, the Philharmonic Society moved to Kharkiv when the city became the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. But in 1934 it returned to Kyiv when the city regained its status. After the 1941 Nazi invasion, the Philharmonic Society stopped its work, and most of its priceless archives were destroyed. During the German occupation of Kyiv, the Society's building was converted to a German Officer's Club. This was one of the important reasons why the building was not destroyed, remaining one of the very few surviving pre-war buildings on Khreshchatyk street. Following the liberation of Kyiv, the Philharmonic Society building resumed its operation in 1944 as soon as hostilities moved away from Kyiv. = National Philharmonic = In 1962, the building was renamed to Mykola Lysenko Kyiv State Philharmonic in honor of the composer's 120th birthday anniversary and the 50th anniversary of his death. It was also awarded the status of architectural monument. In the 1980s, the building suffered a flood, during which many of its music libraries and archives perished. The conditions demanded restoration, which began in 1995. A year later, the restored building opened its doors to the public. In October 1994, the newly elected President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, granted the building the status of National Philharmonic of Ukraine. In 2000, the National Philharmonic received a cultural grant from the Government of Japan with which it was able to acquire a new concert grand piano and additional musical instruments for its symphony orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine. Today, the Lysenko Colonnaded Hall of the Philharmonic remains one of the two most prestigious classical music stages in the city (along with the Kyiv Opera.)

One knife is captured in flight, fractions of a second before impact. In circus and vaudeville acts, a target girl is a female assistant in \\"impalement\\" acts such as knife throwing, archery or sharpshooting. The assistant stands in front of a target board or is strapped to a moving board and the impalement artist throws knives or shoots projectiles so as to hit the board but miss the assistant. The image or character of the target girl has become an icon in fiction and visual media. Introduction Although some assistants are male there is no common equivalent term for a male assistant. This reflects the fact that, historically at least, female assistants have predominated in the acts in question.Stanley Brion in the foreword to Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant, (pub. Turnshare, London, 2005), p.x The presence of an assistant as a human target provides a powerful element of risk. Without assistants placing themselves in danger these acts would be simple demonstrations of accuracy, but with the potential for injury or death the show is much more dramatic. Target girls often wear revealing costumes, thus adding an element of overt sexuality to an act. In this respect there is some similarity to magicians' assistants, although there is a distinct difference in that any apparent danger to an assistant in a magic act is mostly an illusion, whereas impalement acts are demonstrations of accuracy, nerve and calculated risk and the danger is real. While some observers have perceived target girls as masochistic or passive and some feminists criticise the concept as misogynist, several target girls have given accounts of themselves as assertive women and portrayed their experiences as empowering (see Target girls as authors). Various theories have been put forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama.The most extensive evidence of the debate on this topic is to be found in various online forums, including the Dangerous Circus Acts groups on Yahoo! In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.Dr Joachim Heil PhD, \\"A short philosophical essay on the art of knife throwing\\", in Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway, pp.83-114 Jim Steinmeyer, a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books on the history of magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that P. T. Selbit's stage debut of the Sawing Through A Woman illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: \\"...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\\". A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: \\"Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - we, humans, love it. And we love a vulnerable woman. Isn't there something oddly attractive about the woman in danger? I remember seeing lots of soundless black and white movies with a girl tied to the railroad tracks or a girl tied to a sawmill by some evil perverted landlord.\\"Ula, The Knife Thrower's Assistant , painproofrubbergirls.com, (2003) Notable real life target girls Like magicians' assistants, target girls have often suffered the injustice of not receiving the same recognition and billing as their co-performers. Those that have received equal billing have generally been part of husband and wife acts, which are common in this field. Acts that involve a domestic partnership as well as an on-stage one have tended to have greater longevity than pairings where a thrower recruits an assistant as an employee. It has been suggested that this is because the off-stage domestic ties serve to keep the partnership together in the face of the tensions that can occur within such acts. The lack of individual billing for target girls adds to the difficulty of picking out notable examples. The following is therefore a small selection who are distinguished by particular features of their careers rather than a definitive \\"hall of fame\\". * Elizabeth Collins is almost unique in having effectively ended up with top billing in the knife throwing act she formed with her husband Martin Collins. The couple met and married in their native Hungary at around the time of the outbreak of World War II and began performing together as \\"Elizabeth and Collins\\". For their signature stunt they developed an extremely demanding trick that involved Elizabeth spinning on a \\"wheel of death\\" target while her husband balanced on a tightrope and threw knives at her. After the war they settled in Britain and toured clubs and theatres around the world. They were one of the first impalement acts to break into television. Elizabeth retired from performing in the early 1960s and was replaced by their daughter who was also named Elizabeth (although additionally known as Agnes). Elizabeth and Collins performed on The Ed Sullivan Show three times and appeared as themselves in an episode of the 1960s spy series The Avengers. *Helga and Sylvia Brumbach are a mother and daughter who have both been part of a family act that is regarded by many other artists as setting the standard in their field. The Brumbachs, also known as Los Alamos, began with Fritz Brumbach as a knife thrower and whip cracker and his wife Helga as target girl. Later daughter Sylvia joined the act as a second target girl and then son Patrick became a thrower. Fritz and Helga have since retired but Patrick and Sylvia continue the act. Fritz is a Guinness World Record holder for rapid throwing around a live target. * Irene Stey married into an old established Swiss circus family when she wed Rolf Stey. The couple worked as a knife act called \\"Two Tornados\\" between 1965 and 1985 and are notable for being one of only two acts to repeat the combined \\"wheel of death\\" and tightrope stunt developed by Elizabeth and Collins. After retiring as a target girl Irene continued in the circus business with an equestrian act. * Barbara Braun began performing with her husband Sylvester as the \\"Wizards of the West\\" in the early 1940s. Sixty years later the couple were honoured by the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame with the \\"Knife Throwing Pioneer Award\\" and the title \\"Wild West Duo of the 20th Century\\". * Montana Nell was the performing name of Pearl Collins who, between 1929 and 1950, toured with her husband Robert Collins in a western arts act under the billing of \\"Texas Slim and Montana Nell\\". She was born Pearl Miller and grew up on a farm, which helped her become a highly proficient horse rider. In 1923 she married a man called Seamor Russell with whom she had a daughter named Doris. Seamor died of an illness in 1925 and Pearl went on to marry Collins in 1929. When Doris was 16 she joined her parents' show as a trick rider and sharp shooter named \\"Little Miss Peggy\\". Pearl and Robert Collins were posthumously honoured by the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame in 2006. * Claude Chantal Blanc is an experienced Swiss aerial and tight wire artist who is unusual for working as part of an all-female knife throwing act named Risk Ladies. The thrower was Caroline Haerdi, who currently works in partnership with a male thrower named Arno Black; she as the thrower and he as the target. * Tina Nagy Is a dancer and aerial artist who featured as a target girl in the 2007 season of the NBC television series America's Got Talent. Nagy, who is of Hungarian descent but grew up in Connecticut, performed with knife thrower The Great Throwdini. Her interest in the impalement arts began through working as a target girl for bullwhip artist Robert Dante. She has sought to produce a performance artform that combines dance and whip cracking. * Ekaterina Sknarina is a model, actress, contortionist, aerial artist and former international gymnast. She was born in Russia and competed at world championship level for the Russian rhythmic gymnastics team. She later trained as an aerial artist with Cirque du Soleil. After re-locating to New York she began working as a contortionist in the burgeoning new burlesque scene. She also began working as a model and appeared in magazines including FHM, One World, and GQ. She added the role of target girl to her portfolio after meeting knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In 2005 she was one of the stars of the off-Broadway show Maximum Risk, during which she helped set two world records for the number of knives thrown around a human target in a minute. She was Miss Coney Island 2007. She appears in the movie Across the Universe (2007) and was featured in promotional posters for it. =Target girls as authors= A very small and select group of women are notable for having used personal experience to write about the impalement arts from the point of view of the target girl. They include: * Astrid Schollenberger a middle-aged German single mother with a master's degree in philosophy and a regular job who, at the suggestion of her boyfriend Dr Joachim Heil, volunteered as a target girl for knife thrower Dr David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini). Schollenberger worked with Adamovich for a show in New York in 2002 where he first publicly performed the \\"Wheel of death\\" stunt. Later Schollenberger, Adamovich and Heil wrote a book about the experience titled A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant.Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant , Turnshare (London, 2005), * Ronnie Claire Edwards is an American actress born in 1933. She is best known for the role of \\"Corabeth Walton Godsey\\" in the series The Waltons (1972 - 1981). Her substantial and often quirky career is recalled in an autobiography titled The Knife Thrower's Assistant: Memoirs of a Human Target.Ronnie Claire Edwards, The Knife Thrower's Assistant: Memoirs of a Human Target, Hawk Publishing Group, (October 2000), * Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl started as one half of a duo called The Painproof Rubbergirls who did contortion and various sideshow-type stunts, such as the Bed of nails. After her partner left for other work, Ula continued as a solo performer doing various aerial acts as well as a signature routine that involves contortion feats on a bed of swords. In 2003 she worked as a target girl for Dr David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) and later wrote a lengthy article about the act and the philosophy behind her part in it. Ula was featured as a target girl in the US edition of FHM magazine in March 2006. =Celebrity target girls= A small group of target girls are notable for the fact that they are well known celebrities who performed the role for charitable purposes or other reasons apart from their main career. These are examples of the target girl, rather than the thrower, being the main individual in the act. The annual Circus of the Stars television special, made by CBS between 1977 and 1994, provided a number of examples. They include: * Lynda Carter, the actress best known as television's Wonder Woman, appeared as a target girl on the very first Circus of the Stars in January 1977, with actor David Janssen throwing knives at her.It has been suggested that Janssen and Carter's act was faked using a trick target board that worked in a manner similar to the method exposed on the Masked Magician television show. Professional throwers have observed that Janssen's throwing style is wrong and would result in wildly inaccurate throws if he were really throwing knives. This seems to be the only occasion when a knife throwing act was faked on Circus of the Stars. All the other occasions when the show included a knife act involved professional throwers and the genuine nature of the acts has been confirmed through study of video footage. * Actress and model Ann Turkel performed the role of target girl for knife thrower Skeeter Vaughan in the second Circus of the Stars in December 1977. * Charlene Tilton, the actress best known for her role in the television series Dallas, famously appeared in a gold bikini as a target girl for knife thrower Skeeter Vaughan in the 1979 Circus of the Stars.. * Sally Kellerman, the actress who played Major Margaret \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan in the film MASH, appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Larry Cisewski on the 1981 Circus of the Stars. She was seen holding balloons for Cisewski to burst and also braved being spun around on his \\"Devil's door\\" target board as he planted knives around her. * Linda Blair, the actress who rose to fame as a child star in The Exorcist, appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Paul Lacross on Circus of the Stars in 1983.Linda Blair appeared on the show three times, in 1982, 1983 and 1990. See . She was pictured in costume and holding a set of throwing axes on the cover of the 18–24 December 1983 issue of TV News magazine * Actress Britt Ekland appeared as a target girl for knife thrower Fritz Brumbach on Circus of the Stars in 1986. * Television presenter and actress Ursula von Manescul appeared as a target girl on the annual German charity circus show Stars in der Manege in 1967. She performed with a duo called The Williams Boys. * Actress Simone Thomalla was a target girl for world-record breaking impalement artist Patrick Brumbach in the final edition of the German television charity show Stars in der Manege, recorded in December 2008. During the act she rode a rotating target board as Brumbach threw knives around her and she also held out targets for him to cut with a whip. Fictional and artistic representation The mixture of peril, nerve and sexuality inherent in the idea of a target girl has proved attractive to writers, artists, moviemakers and television executives. =Movie and television= There are many instances of target girls as iconic or emblematic images in film and television. The most notable movie example is the character Adele portrayed by Vanessa Paradis in the film Girl on the Bridge (1999), in which the knife throwing act is at the centre of the plot and serves as a powerful erotic metaphor. Other examples include: * The fourth season of the television series Bones, featured an episode (first aired in 2009) in which title character Temperance \\"Bones\\" Brennan goes undercover as a target girl with Special Agent Seeley Booth as a knife- thrower. *An interesting inversion can be found in the animated series Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, in which female knife-thrower Catherine Bloom uses a male assistant, Trowa Barton. Although several characters through the series express an admiration for Trowa's good looks, the costume he chooses to wear during performances has little to no sexual appeal--notably, half of his face is hidden by a mask. In contrast, Catherine's costume while performing as knife-thrower is more in line with the revealing and hypersexualized target girl image. * Cameron Diaz's character Jenny Everdeane acts as a target girl in a scene in the film Gangs of New York (2002) which was used in promotional clips. * In the television series Nikki, an episode aired in 2001 featured the characters played by Nikki Cox and Susan Egan taking jobs as target girls. * The television play The Act (1987) revolved around a knife throwing act and a girl who applies for a job as the assistant. It was made for the BBC and was a co-production involving the Royal College of Art. It starred Caroline Embling and Bill Rourke. Real life knife thrower Jay Ruffley provided throwing skills in one scene and also appeared as the owner of a club.The Act was 25 minutes long and was originally transmitted on BBC2 on 18 August 1987 at 10.20pm. See details at Jay Ruffley sometimes performed under the name Cetan Mani. See * Courteney Cox's character in the 1987 television movie If it's Tuesday it still must be Belgium becomes a target girl in a circus knife throwing act. * In the movie Bronco Billy (1980), actresses Sondra Locke and Tessa Richarde are both seen as target girls for a sharpshooter and knife thrower played by Clint Eastwood. Locke's role in the act is central to the plot. * In the television series Charlie's Angels, Cheryl Ladd's character Kris Munroe goes undercover as a target girl in an episode titled \\"Circus of Terror\\" (1977). * The spy thriller Masquerade (1965) features Marisa Mell as a target girl named Sophie.For a publicity still see * Target girls were iconic figures in a series of horror films set in circuses that were made in the 1960s. These include: ** Circus of Horrors (1960), in which Vanda Hudson played a target girl called Magda von Meck. ** Circus of Fear (1966), which features British actress Margaret Lee as an assistant facing danger in a knife act. ** Berserk! (1967), in which Judy Geeson played a target girl in a circus knife act. * The film Phantom of the Rue Morgue (1954) has an early scene featuring one of the female leads as a target girl. * In \\"Lucy Tells the Truth\\" (1953), an episode of the television series I Love Lucy, a white lie leads to Lucille Ball's character ending up as the assistant in a knife act. =Theatre= The play Pin Cushion, by Clay McLeod Chapman is based around a husband and wife knife throwing act and consists of the target girl delivering a monologue while her husband throws knives around her. It was performed as part of Chapman's Pumpkin Pie Show at The Red Room Theatre, New York, in May and June 2002. The performance involved a genuine knife throwing act, with actress Niabi Caldwell as the target girl and professional knife thrower Dr. David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) playing her husband. =Photography= The target girl has also been used as an image in fashion and art photography. Examples include: * Model Karen Elson is seen spinning on a \\"wheel of death\\" target in a picture by photographer Steven Meisel that formed part of a series titled \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" in the April 2007 issue of the Italian edition of Vogue magazine. * Model Kate Moss appeared on a \\"wheel of death\\" target in two of a series of fashion photos by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott in the April 2006 issue of W magazine. * Actress Jennifer Ellison appeared strapped to a \\"wheel of death\\" target and surrounded by knives in the UK edition of Maxim magazine in 2005. The picture was reproduced in the Daily Star newspaper on 1 December 2005. * Drummer Meg White appeared as a target girl on a \\"wheel of death\\" target in a photo of The White Stripes by Annie Leibovitz in 2003. The picture was part of a series that appeared in a book and an exhibition, both titled Annie Leibovitz: American Music. * Singer and musician Shakira appeared standing against a target with knives around her in a photo in the April 2002 issue of FHM magazine (UK edition). * Actress Goldie Hawn appeared in a circus costume strapped to a \\"wheel of death\\" target for a photoshoot in 1990 that was later featured in Rolling Stone magazine in 2001. =Literature= * Steven Millhauser's short story The Knife Thrower features a thrower who specialises in nicking those who stand at the target board for him, including his female assistant. It was published as part of a collection that bears the same title. At least one edition features as its cover a painting of a girl standing in front of a target board. * The relationship between a target girl and a circus knifethrower is the central motif in the poem cycle Das Mädchen und der Messerwerfer published in 1997 by noted German poet Wolf Wondratschek. * The novel Knives of Desire by Marion Zimmer Bradley (writing under the pen name Morgan Ives) is about a woman who becomes involved in a lesbian relationship after joining a circus to be the target girl for a female knife thrower. The cover of the original edition, published in 1966, shows two women in skimpy bikinis, one standing against a target board and the other throwing a knife. =Music= * Gretchen Peters uses the target girl as a central metaphor in her song Woman on the Wheel, which was debuted on her 2010 tour in support of her Circus Girl album. She later released a recorded version on her 2012 album Hello Cruel World. * Tom Waits's song \\"Circus\\" from his 2004 album Real Gone features a knife throwing act as part of the eponymous travelling show. * Alice in Chains uses a target girl in their 1994 I Stay Away music video as part of a circus act, where a knife thrower accidentally kills his target girl when flies distract him and throw off his aim. * Slaughter uses a target girl on the album cover of their 1990 Stick It to Ya album. The debut album was infamous for featuring a photo of former Playboy playmate Laurie Carr wearing a swimsuit, strapped to a target board and surrounded by knives. The cover of a subsequent release, Stick It Live, featured an image apparently from the same shoot as the first but this time showing the target girl walking towards the target board hand-in-in-hand with a knife thrower.

They are not the same as Jewish English Bible translations, although they are often translated by Jewish Christian scholars. They are often not standard straight English translations of the Christian Bible, but are translations which specifically incorporate Jewish elements for a Jewish audience. These elements include, but are not limited to, the use of the Hebrew names for all books, the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) ordering for the books of the Old Testament, both testaments being named their Hebrew names (Tanakh and Brit Chadasha). This approach also includes the New Testament being translated with the preference of spelling names (people, concepts and place names) in transliterated Hebrew rather than directly translated from Greek into English. Some Sacred Name Bibles such as the Hallelujah Scriptures, conform to these elements and therefore may be considered Messianic Bibles as well. English =Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) = The Complete Jewish Bible (sometimes referred to as the CJB) is a translation of the Bible into English by David H. Stern. It consists of both Stern's revised translation of the Old Testament (Tanakh) plus his original Jewish New Testament (B'rit Hadashah) translation in one volume. It was published in its entirety in 1998 by Jewish New Testament Publications, Inc. The Old Testament translation is a paraphrase of the public domain 1917 Jewish Publication Society Version, although scholar Bruce Metzger notes that where Stern disagreed with the JPS version, he translated from the Masoretic Text himself. The New Testament section is Stern's original translation from the ancient Greek. Stern states that his purpose for producing the Complete Jewish Bible was \\"to restore God's Word to its original Jewish context and culture as well as be in easily read modern English.\\" This translation was also intended to be fully functional for Messianic Jewish congregations. Stern follows the order and the names of the Old Testament books in the Hebrew Bible, rather than those of typical Christian Bibles. He uses Hebrew names for people and places, such as Eliyahu for \\"Elijah\\", and Sha'ul for \\"Saul.\\" The work also incorporates Hebrew and Yiddish expressions that Stern refers to as \\"Jewish English\\", such as matzah for \\"unleavened bread\\" and mikveh for \\"ritual immersion pool\\". =Tree of Life Version of the Holy Scriptures (TLV)= The Tree of Life Version (abbreviated as \\"TLV\\"), first published in 2011, is a Messianic Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible (or TA-NA-KH) and the New Testament (or New Covenant) sponsored by the Messianic Jewish Family Bible Society and The King's University.Holy Scriptures.

GEM is the United Nations Development Programme's attempt to measure the extent of gender inequality across the globe's countries, based on estimates of women's relative economic income, participation in high-paying positions with economic power, and access to professional and parliamentary positions. It was introduced at the same time as the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) but measures topics like empowerment that are not covered by that index.  History  In 1995 in the Human Development Report commissioned by the United Nations Development Program set-out to create two new measurement indices for measuring development. Their aim was to add to the Human Development Index by way of including a gender dimension in the measure. They were created in order to rival the traditional income-focused measures of development such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Gross National Product (GNP). Mahbub ul Haq, the first director of the Human Development Report Office, established several principles for the newly emerging measure including provisions that it had to be simple, had to be represented as a single number, had to be easily calculated, had to yield numbers that were internationally comparable, had to use numbers available on a yearly basis and had to use numbers that were easily interpretable. The resulting measures that were created were the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). The GEM, the more specialized of the two, is focused on indicating the relative empowerment of women in a given country.Klasen S. UNDP's Gender-Related Measures: Some Conceptual Problems and Possible Solutions. Journal of Human Development [serial online]. July 2006;7(2):243-274. Available from: EconLit with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 26, 2011.  Definition and calculation  The GEM was designed to measure \\"whether women and men are able to actively participate in economic and political life and take part in decision-making\\" (UNDP, 1995, p. 73)(Klasen 257). The GEM tends to be more agency focused (what people are actually able to do) than well-being focused (how people feel or fare in the grand scheme of things). The GEM is determined using three basic indicators: Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments, percentage of women in economic decision making positions (incl. administrative, managerial, professional and technical occupations) and female share of income (earned incomes of males vs. females).Betata, H. C. (2007). What is missing in measures of women's empowerment?. Journal of Human Development , 7(2), 221-241. The GEM is thought to be a valuable policy instrument because it allows certain dimensions that were previously difficult to compare between countries to come into international comparison.Charmes J, Wieringa S. Measuring Women's Empowerment: An Assessment of the Gender- Related Development Index and the Gender Empowerment Measure. Journal of Human Development [serial online]. November 2003;4(3):419-435. Available from: EconLit with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 26, 2011.  Debates  As time passes, and these measures (the GDI and the GEM) are applied year after year, debate has arisen over whether or not they have been as influential in promoting gender-sensitive development as was hoped when they were first created. Some of the major criticisms of both measures includes that they are highly specialized and difficult to interpret, often misinterpreted, suffer from large data gaps, do not provide accurate comparisons across countries, and try to combine too many development factors into a single measure. The concern then arises that if these indices are not well informed, then their numbers might hide more than they reveal. In terms of the GEM in particular, it is often said to represent an elite bias. It has been accused of measuring inequality only among the most educated and economically advantaged women and to focus mainly on the higher echelons of society. Women in grassroots organizations or at the local political level are not reflected, as well as work in lower levels of employment or in the informal sector, where many women in poor and developing countries are forced to seek employment. Furthermore, statistical information (data) is not very readily available for many of the indicators in the GEM. Not many less- developed countries collect reliable data on women's involvement in economic participation or labor involvement. As a result, the GEM is only reliable for very highly developed countries which do collect those statistics. It is also often argued that the number of women in parliament isn't an adequate indication of gender empowerment progress in a given country because many times feminists are considered political liabilities, and as such, female politicians do not always promote female interests. On the other hand, however, information regarding the number of parliamentary seats held by women is very easy to obtain, and very hard to alter, making it one of the more reliable sources of data in the measure. Another criticism of the GEM is its failure to address the issue of female control over their bodies and sexuality, which some argue is an important source of female empowerment and as such should be included in the measure. Additionally, the GEM has also been criticized for being far too dependent on the income component of the measure for determining the overall GEM score.  Suggestions for improving  =Suggested alterations= Many suggestions have been made to alter the GEM. It has been suggested that the GEM be altered to include female representation in local government instead of only national government to make it less elite. Furthermore, it has been recommended that it should be revised to reflect female participation in political activities such as voting. Additionally, it has been recommended that a component regarding women's control over their own bodies and sexuality be added by measuring availability of birth control and the right to abortion. It has also been suggested that the GEM could be altered to include the proportion of females who are in extreme poverty as opposed to the proportion of parliamentary positions held by females. Lastly, it has been suggested that the GEM could be altered to include female levels of unemployment. Other suggestions include coming up with different ways to deal with the earned income part so as to make it a more straightforward mode of measurement.Klasen, Stephan1; Schuler, Dana. Reforming the Gender-Related Development Index and the Gender Empowerment Measure: Implementing Some Specific Proposals. Feminist Economics. January 2011 (1) 1 - 30 = Suggested alternatives = Suggestions have also been made to replace the GEM as a whole. One such suggestion is the calculation of separate Human Development Indexes for males and females which would provide a more straightforward picture of gender inequality (first suggested by Halis Akder in 1994). Another suggestion is to create a Gender-Gap Measure. In 2003 Charmes and Wieringa came up with the Women's Empowerment Matrix which considers six spheres (physical, socio-cultural, religious, political, legal and economic) as well as six levels: individual, household, community, state, regional, and global. The GEE is another suggested alternative to the GEM, this measure would include legal framework and protection of women's rights, as well as other important areas of women's empowerment that are overlooked by the GEM like women's movements, public attitudes, and equal rights. Lastly, in the 2010 Human Development Report, a new measuring mechanism was created entitled the Gender Inequality Index. This new experimental measure considers three dimensions: Reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation which aim to ameliorate some of the problems associated with the GEM.

The conference was proposed by German foreign minister Count Herbert von Bismarck (son of chancellor Otto von Bismarck) to reconvene the adjourned Washington conference on Samoa of 1887. Herbert von Bismarck invited delegations from the United States and the British Empire to Berlin in April 1889. The treaty launched the condominium in Samoa between the United States, Germany and Great Britain. It was designed to guarantee the preservation of rights of the three powers as secured in separate treaties with the Samoan régime in 1878 and 1879. Further, the independence and neutrality of the Samoan government was ensured, public finance was reorganized and the Samoan king elected in 1881 was restored. In an effort to strengthen the judiciary an American/European chief justice position was created, and the municipality of Apia was reestablished, chaired by a council president. The treaty was signed at Berlin by the three powers on 14 June 1889; ratifications were exchanged on 12 April 1890 and assented to by the Samoan government on 19 April 1890, in effect four governments were party to the Berlin Act. The condominium ended in political shambles after ten years with the ratification of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 and the resulting partition of the Samoan archipelago.

Dan had a close professional association with actress Naomi Tani throughout her career. He died May 6, 2011. Life and career =Early life= Oniroku Dan was born in Shiga Prefecture on April 16, 1931. His father, Nobuyuki Kuroiwa, had once aimed to be a screenwriter. His mother, Yukie Katori, was a former movie actress and a former student of the novelist Sanjugo Naoki. This was her second marriage. In 1944 Dan's father was appointed to work in Osaka and the whole family moved to Kansai region. There Dan attended Kwansei Gakuin Middle School, Kwansei Gakuin High School, and graduated from the Department of Law of Kwansei Gakuin University. Dan moved to Tokyo soon after graduation in 1955. Dan's interest in films was nurtured early in life because his parents owned a movie theater.Hamamoto, Maki. \\"15 minute interview with S/M Guru Oniroku Dan at Naomi Tani's party,\\" Asian Cult Cinema, #23 (2nd quarter, 1999), p.21 Dan also claimed to have discovered his interest in S/M very early in life: \\"I even liked this kind of thing in kindergarten. I remember we had a lovely young teacher in her early twenties. More than anything in the world, I wanted to tie her up.\\" Growing up during World War II, Dan learned English from American POWs. In the 1950s, he worked as a translator for English- language television programs, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents. In the 1960s, Dan taught English at a junior high school. While teaching he began writing scripts under the pseudonym \\"Matsugoro Kuroiwa\\" for Pink films produced by small independent studios. It was during this early stage of his career that Dan's long professional relationship with actress Naomi Tani began.Tani, Naomi. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1998). \\"Naomi Tani - An Interview with Nikkatsu's Queen of S/M\\" (Conducted in January 1998 in Kyushu, Japan) in Asian Cult Cinema Number 19, April 1998. p.39 =Fame= In 1956 Dan won an honorable mention for \\"Death in Naniwa,\\" which he submitted under the name Matsujiro Kuroiwa (黒岩松次郎) in the All Rookie Cup sponsored by Bungeishunju's \\"Ooru Yomimono\\" Magazine. In 1957 he was awarded the runner-up prize for \\"Oyakodon,\\" which he submitted in the 11th All Rookie Cup sponsored by Bungeishunju's \\"Ooru Yomimono\\" Magazine. However, Oniroku Dan's S&M; novel Flower and Snake, is the work that made him famous. This novel was first serialized in the S&M; magazine Kitan Club under another pseudonym Kyotaro Hanamaki （花巻京太郎）that Dan used during his early career. In addition to a popular film, released in 1974, this novel inspired a series of nine books,Bornoff, p.539 and a new series of Nikkatsu Roman porno films released between 1985 and 1987. In 1974, after years of negotiations, Nikkatsu finally succeeded in recruiting Tani for their Roman porno series by agreeing to her request that her first film be based on Dan's Flower and Snake. Dan and Tani had objected to departures from Dan's story made in the film's script by director Masaru Konuma and script-writer Yozo Tanaka.Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in Asian Cult Cinema, #22, 1st Quarter, 1999, p.22-23 The film, Flower and Snake, became a major hit for the studio and is credited both with starting the highly successful S/M genre of Nikkatsu's Roman porno films, and with establishing Naomi Tani as the third of Nikkatsu's Roman Porno Queens and the first \\"S/M Queen.\\"Weisser, p.334. Still offended by the changes in his story for Flower and Snake, Dan refused to participate in the follow-up to that film, Wife to be Sacrificed. In interviews, Dan claimed that this second film, which proved even more successful than Flower and Snake, was based on a story he had written, but that he had insisted his name be removed from the credits.Dan, Oniroku. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1999). \\"15 minute interview with S&M; Guru Oniroku Dan at Naomi Tani's party,\\" Asian Cult Cinema, #23 (2nd quarter, 1999), p.22. Director Masaru Konuma, however, says that it was an original story by Yozo Tanaka.Konuma, p.24 Nevertheless, Dan and Nikkatsu were able to settle their differences, and Dan later gave the studio exclusive rights to his novels, many of which were filmed with Naomi Tani. Dan's association with Nikkatsu continued for more than ten years, even after Tani's retirement from the screen. Though the films were sometimes criticized for their predictability, the formulaic structure he developed for most of his film scripts became the model for Nikkatsu's successful and long- lived S/M Roman porno series.Weisser, p.356. Flower and Snake and other Dan's works published in various S&M; magazines, such as Kitan Club, Fuzoku Club, Uramado, and Abu Hunter, were made available to a large public. Moreover, he influenced many subsequent writers who took up the theme of sadomasochism later, such as Murakami Ryu, for example. Thus, although Dan Oniroku's works are generally not considered a high-brow literature but a soft pornography, his influence on certain works of Japanese popular fiction and film industry is considerable. Moreover, Dan not only contributed to the Japanese pink film industry but also to the S&M; publications, as he established another S&M; magazine, SM King in 1972 (active till 1974). =Retirement and comeback= In the early 1990s, having by then written over two hundred S/M novels, Dan ceased writing and embarked on an ultimately unsuccessful business venture.Dan, p.24 After a break of nearly ten years, he returned to writing, publishing his autobiography, The Flower Must Be Crimson: The World of Oniroku Dan. Soon after he came out of retirement, his popularity was such that he was involved in eight serialized magazine novels and the writing of another book.Hamamoto, p.21, 24. =In English= Four of Dan's stories, originally published in Japanese in 1997, were published in English in 2010 by Vertical, Inc.Season of Infidelity by James Hadfiield, Japan Today The collection is titled Season of Infidelity and the stories have \\"loosely biographical\\" elements, while the last story Bewitching Bloom is a telling of his relationship with Naomi Tani, also including notes about three subsequent Nikkatsu \\"Queens\\"; Junko Mabuki, Izumi Shima, and Miki Takakura.Season of Infidelity, p. 175 - 177 Critique of style Oniroku Dan was married, with children, and Nicholas Bornoff describes him as a \\"man with a genuine aura of rather tweedy, comfortable professorship.\\" Dan developed his own variation on S&M;, but when asked if he ever acted on his S&M; and bondage fantasies with his wife, Dan replied, \\"No way! She would beat my ass.\\" Director Masaru Konuma calls his own early S/M films \\"European-type S/M,\\" and says, \\"Later S/M developed in a very Japanese fashion. The Oniroku Dan way.\\"Konuma, p.22. Konuma says that Dan described three purposes of S/M: \\"for punishment, for confinement and for a sense of shame,\\" and that \\"Oniroku Dan dislikes S&M; as punishment... his novels and screenplays are centered around the 'humiliation' concept.\\" Dan confirmed Konuma's view by observing, \\"My book editors often confuse S/M with cruelty and they want me to write some 'punishment tale' for them. This type of story is out of my realm. It just gives me the creeps. Rather, my concept of S/M is 'distorted sexual desire' or extreme disorientation. It's a male fantasy derived from love... from seeing a beauty suffer through the sense of shame. Therefore, my style contains a romantic, aesthetic, and sometimes decadent fragrance.\\" Konuma says of Dan's female characters, \\"In his novels, he's searching for the beauty of women. He creates an ideal woman and proceeds to sell an S/M 'fantasy' to his readers.\\" According to Naomi Tani, Dan's perfect film actress must \\"look good in a kimono; she needs to have long jet-black hair; she must have a certain amount of body fat, so that the bondage rope makes a clear impression on her skin; and she has to be graceful under torture, with strong facial expressions.\\"Tani, p.41 Dan said that Naomi Tani fit all these conditions, and that he used her as the model for several of the women in his novels. Commenting on Tani's sudden retirement at the height of her popularity in 1979, Dan said, \\"I went into shock. It was the end of the Golden Duo. I almost decided to quit writing.\\"Hamamoto, p.22. In summing up Dan's work, Bornoff comments, \\"Dan has the knack of making sadism respectable.\\" Commenting on the growing cult popularity of his Nikkatsu Roman porno films in the United States, Dan acknowledged the differing ways of cultural and artistic expression between the two countries, and said: \\"I understand some aspects of the pink film are not acceptable in America. But ultimately, if the American people recognize the special quality [of] Oniroku Dan's world through his sex films - then I am more than happy.\\"Dan, p.25 Partial filmography * Flower and Snake (Hana to hebi) director: Masaru Konuma; starring: Naomi Tani (1974) * Oryu's Passion: Bondage Skin (Oryū jōen: shibari hada) director: Katsuhiko Fujii; starring: Naomi Tani (1975) * Lady Moonflower (Yugao fujin) a.k.a.

He released four albums through John Zorn's Tzadik Records label : * Dance of the Idiots (2003) * Mood Swings (2005) * Orobas: Book of Angels Volume 4 (2006) * Is He Listening? (2009). King Papaya was independently released in 2009 to positive reviews. As well as producing solo material Israelite has established a career producing for a range of artists, touring stages around the world and co-operating with a number of film, theatre and television companies. Biography =Early life= At the age of six, Koby Israelite started taking classical piano lessons at the Tel Aviv conservatory of music. At the age of 15 he started to play the drum kit and studied jazz at the David Rich School of Drumming in Tel Aviv. Self-taught on his brother’s left handed right handed guitar, he joined several rock, punk and heavy metal bands. Whilst living and studying in Israel he became exposed to a whole range of different styles and genres from a variety of locations around the world, which has rounded his now eclectic style. After finishing studies in Israel he turned down the chance to study at Berklee College of Music and instead moved to London to further his career. =Early career= After moving to London a number of new opportunities arose in Koby's career. He joined a rock group and also became a professional session drummer, mastering numerous musical styles from jazz to metal to drum and bass to West African funk. After his band failed to agree on the terms of a proposed record contract he decided to part ways and become more independent as an artist, which led to the start of composition and recording of his own solo material. After seeing the Romanian Gypsy outfit Taraf de Haïdouks play live in London, Koby became immediately endeared to the accordion. The acquisition of an accordion was a milestone in Koby's musical direction. Israelite began gigging and recording with a number of Taraf De Haidouks members as well as having his music covered by Fanfare Ciocărlia. After building Bamba Studios at his home in London, Israelite began producing, writing and arranging for himself and others. Koby sent a demo recording to idol and major influence John Zorn, which was another milestone in Koby Israelite's career. =Signing to Tzadik= Koby Israelite was offered a recording contract with New York Label Tzadik Records in April 2003, owned by John Zorn himself. He released four albums through the established Tzadik Records imprint, Dance of the Idiots (2003), Mood Swings (2005) Orobas: Book of Angels Volume 4 (2006) and Is He Listening? (2009). Koby Israelite also contributed to a number of albums written by John Zorn under the Masada Book 2: The Book of Angels series. =Becoming an independent artist= After success through the Tzadik label, Koby managed to establish himself as an independent artist. He independently released King Papaya. He is continuing the recording and production of his own solo work as well as studio and touring projects with a range of other artists and musicians. =Music for movies, television and radio= Koby's music has appeared on the BBC and Channel 4. He produced an original score for Israeli Academy Award winning TV programme “The Ten Commandments”. He was selected to appear in Madonna’s directorial debut film Filth and Wisdom. He has written an original score for the film Jerusalem Syndrome.

The idea has stemmed from work by sociologists such as Tom R. Burns and Peter Hall, the economist Thomas Baumgartner, as well as by political scientists such as James Rosenau and Stephen D. Krasner. Its study often uses the language of game theory since at some level, having meta-power over a group of people means that one can control the form of the game, thereby controlling the outcome. Background Power and social control are typically conceptualized and investigated in terms of interpersonal or intergroup relationships in which one actor tries to get another to do something, usually against the latter's will.(e.g., Blau, 1964, Dahl, 1967; Burns and Buckley, 1976; Weber, 1968) That is, power is on the level of interaction or relationships involving “situated contests between opposing actors”.(Hall, 1997) The object of power is more or less direct behavioral control. Such an approach to the study of power captures only a part of the power activities of groups, organizations, and states. A large, and historically more important part involves attempts to structure or re- structure the social and cultural matrix within which power activities are played out; such structuring may involve the manipulation of institutional arrangements, norms, and values. A given institutional or socio-cultural structure may be viewed as the macroscopic resultant of the application of structural or meta-power to determine permissible or acceptable activities and relationships of individuals and groups to one another and to resources or forms of property. Conceptualization Since the mid-1970s there emerged a substantial body of work on meta-power or relational and structural control, that is control over social relationships and social structure, the structuring of interaction situations and conditions, for instance the opportunity structures of the actors, their payoff structures and incentive systems, and their orientations, beliefs, and norms vis a vis one another.(Adler and Haas, 1992; Baumgartner and Burns, 1975; Baumgartner, Burns and DeVille, 1975; Baumgartner, Buckley, and Burns, 1975; Baumgartner et al., 1975, Baumgartner et al. 1975, 1976; 1977; Burns and Buckley (1976), Chang, 2004; Hall, 1997, 2003; Himmelstrand et al., 1981; Hollist and Rosenau, 1981; Krasner, 1981; among others) Although structural types of control have specific behavioral consequences and may be used as a means of behavioral control, the purpose of its exercise is generally the long-term structuring of institutional arrangements, key social processes and their outcomes: the individual and collective activities of those whose social relationships are structured. Structural control is used by social groups to ensure the effective functioning of a social system and/or to promote or stabilize their advantages or dominance over others. Among other things, it may be used to encourage cooperative social organization on the one hand, or to produce competition or conflict between actors on the other, and generally, to increase power in relation to others. There are at least three bases of structural control with respect to such systems: control of action opportunities, control of differential payoffs or outcomes of interaction, and control of cultural orientations and ideology. That is, conditions of social action and interaction are structured with the result that certain social relationships and institutional arrangements are established and maintained. In investigations of the exercise of meta-power, one is also interested in differences among actors in resources, skills, strategies, and so forth, but the main focus is on capacities to mobilize power resources to manipulate the matrix of rules or \\"the rules of the game,\\" other conditions of interaction, and the distribution of resources as well as normative and ideological orientations. Meta-power entails the capacity to shape and set the limits of lower order power. Clearly, although an actor B may have social power within an interaction situation or \\"game\\" (e.g., greater ability than others to select a preferred outcome or to realize his will over the opposition of others within that social structural context (e.g., Dahl, Weber), he or she may or may not have power to structure social relationships, to alter the \\"type of game\\" the actors play, the rules and institutions and related conditions governing interactions or exchanges among the actors involved. The Case of Capitalist Systems When one speaks of power in connection with capitalism, one typically thinks of the powers of the capitalists and their diverse lieutenants. But capitalist systems are characterized by structural forms of power, the exercise of meta-power and various forms of relational control.(Himmelstrand et al.,1981) These systems operate to change the world, not only in material terms (production systems, products, infrastructures as well as depletion of resources, pollution of the environment, alteration of ecological systems) but in social and psychological terms (changing people’s levels of resources, their welfare; changing communities, occupations, lifestyles, cultural perspectives). Capitalist systems impact then not only on individuals, but communities, resource bases, and ecological systems. These are extraordinary powers shaping and reshaping human lives and destinies. The multiple powers of capitalism is based on a complex of institutions, which are historical constructions of human agents: property regimes, production and distribution systems, managerial and accounting systems, finance and banking, etc. For Max Weber, possession of property and the lack of property are the basic characteristics of all class situations, but capitalism is more than property regimes, it involves enterprises with their management and control systems, the organization of markets, financial complexes, banks, etc. These entail powers and dis-powers; classes, capitalist owners (whether individuals or collectives), top managers, expert advisors; supervisors, foremen, workers, excluded and marginalized groups – as in the case of any institutional arrangement. There is systematic organized bias distinguishing classes of people in terms of possession of or access to powers in capitalist systems. And those lacking the means or access to the control functions of capitalism – or to the countervailing powers, for example, political—are subject to it. The powers of capitalism not only impact on our lives in myriad ways but transform us, operating as an “external, in many ways invisible force” to which most of us are subject. Of course, there are also capitalist agents, what Marx and Engels referred to as the bourgeoisie (Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848). Leading members of the bourgeoisie are powerful, but are nevertheless constrained to act in particular ways. They are driven by the pursuit of profit and competition, and they rapidly develop and improve instruments of production. “Through developing facilitated means of communication, they “draw all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it [the bourgeoisie] forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.” Basic Types The operation of meta-power on a systemic level, for example, capitalism as a complex of meta-power, can be distinguished from that of particular agents, the bourgeoisie, for instance their positional structuring powers:(Himmelstrand et al., 1981; Burns, 2006) = Structural meta-power = Structural meta-power shapes and constrains the social conditions of social agents, their interactions, their opportunities, and limitations. For instance, institutions and institutional arrangements such as those of capitalism and the state entail organizational bias, that shapes opportunities, that provides careers, status, income, limited power over others as well as constrains certain activities and developments. Rules, procedures, and programs generate patterns of social activities, effects, and developments. Institutional selection may operate, for instance, to change the frequency of certain activity patterns or to alter the distribution of resources (concentration, and centralization, e.g. through ratchet effects), to determine the parameters of power, the forms and types of games actors play. A system like capitalism entails generative processes of meta-power (based on accumulative processes which provide the resource base (material, knowledge, social, political) combined with knowledge development to set in motion new economic and socio-technical developments. Major socio-technical systems, once established, operate as legislative bodies shaping and reshaping human conditions. = Agential meta-power = Agential meta-power is where some agents shape particular structural conditions and institutional arrangements for other actors: to establish a constitution; to carry out substantial reforms, to restructure an industry, to transform social relationships and interaction opportunities and potentialities. The state launches projects, protects workers vis-à-vis their employers, supports (or blocks) the development of nuclear power, and outlaws certain chemicals, and, in general, regulates societal interactions with the environment. Among the processes and developments in which meta-power researchers are interested, some involve powerful agents, for instance capitalist leaders, using their positions of structural power to mobilize resources in order to develop new systems of production, new products, new institutional arrangements, for example in the shaping of economic globalization. The initiatives may also come from state agencies, for example, to establish an infrastructure (airport, highway system, water system, electricity networks) or a regulatory agency; or, the initiative may come from a dominant political leader or party with a mandate (possibly presumed) to reform or transform social conditions. One or more agents is involved in mobilizing power resources for the purposes of launching a project(s), program(s), and institutional innovations. Such projects may be anticipated – or are experienced – by other agents as having positive and/or negative impacts, or possibly mixed consequences along with negative. Opposition may emerge and try to block or modify the project(s). This is part of the dialectics of meta-power and social change, as analyzed and illustrated in a number of works of dating back to the mid-1970s. References  Further reading  * Adler, E. and P. M.

According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus (in the title Romanized to Saturn), who, fearing that he would be overthrown by one of his children,\\"These great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus.\\" - Hesiod ate each one upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 Black Paintings that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Background Quinta del Sordo, c. 1900 In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of Manzanares near Madrid called Quinta del Sordo (Villa of the Deaf Man). It was a two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although the name was fitting for Goya too, who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he left the house to move to Bordeaux, Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with oils directly onto the walls of the house. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the civil strife occurring in Spain. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the Black Paintings. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some tense scenes of malevolence and conflict.\\"But never before and never since, as far as we know, has a major, ambitious cycle of paintings been painted with the intention of keeping the pictures an entirely private affair.\\" Licht, 159 Saturn Devouring His Son, a portrait of the titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, Caelus. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife Ops eventually hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete, deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted. Goya never named the works he produced at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his death,Licht, 168 and this painting is also known as just Saturn, Saturn Devouring One of His Sons, Saturn Devouring his Children or by the Spanish names Saturno devorando a su hijo or Saturno devorando a un hijo. Painting Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons. His child's head and part of the left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has probably been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge widely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, and the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers into the back of the body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis,Morden and Pulimood in Farthing, 375 but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.Connell, 209 Peter Paul Rubens' more Baroque-style Saturn Devouring His Son (1636) may have inspired Goya. Various interpretations of the meaning of the picture have been offered: the conflict between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution. There have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son, Xavier, the only of his six children to survive to adulthood, or with his live-in housekeeper and possible mistress, Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed cannot be determined with certainty. If Goya made any notes on the picture, they have not survived; as he never intended the picture for public exhibition, he probably had little interest in explaining its significance. It has been said that the painting is \\"essential to our understanding of the human condition in modern times, just as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is essential to understanding the tenor of the 16th century\\".Licht, 71 Goya may have been inspired by Peter Paul Rubens' 1636 picture of the same name. Rubens' painting, also held at the Museo del Prado, is a brighter, more conventional treatment of the myth: his Saturn exhibits less of the cannibalistic ferocity portrayed in Goya's rendition. However, some critics have suggested that Rubens' portrayal is the more horrific: the god is portrayed as a calculating remorseless killer, who – fearing for his own position of power – murders his innocent child. Goya's vision, on the other hand, shows a man driven mad by the act of killing his own son. Or it could be interpreted as a titan driven wild with fear at the idea of usurpation from one of his children. In addition, the body of the son in Goya's picture is that of an adult, not the helpless baby depicted by Rubens. Goya had produced a chalk drawing of the same subject in 1796-7 that was closer in tone to Rubens' work: it showed a Saturn similar in appearance to that of Rubens', daintily biting on the leg of one of his sons while he holds another like a leg of chicken, with none of the gore or madness of the later work. Goya scholar Fred Licht has raised doubts regarding the traditional title however, noting that the classical iconographical attributes associated with Saturn are absent from the painting, and the body of the smaller figure does not resemble that of an infant. The rounded buttocks and wide hips of the headless corpse has also called into question the identification of this figure as a male.Connell, 210 Transfer from the Quinta del Sordo Although they were not meant to be seen by the public, the paintings remain important works in Goya's oeuvre. When Goya went into self-imposed exile in France in 1823, he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson, Mariano. After various changes of ownership, the house came into the possession of the Belgian Baron Emile d'Erlanger in 1874. After 70 years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo, the murals were deteriorating badly and, in order to preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas under the direction of Salvador Martínez Cubells, the chief art restorer at the Museo del Prado. After showing them at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state. The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail may have been lost, but in this respect Saturn Devouring His Son appears to have fared better than some of the other works. Influence In 2010, Saturn Devouring His Son became a popular Internet meme after photoshopped images of the painting surfaced online. The figures depicted in the artwork have also been labelled frequently, Saturn usually representing something that the meme's creator finds to be destructive.

It is often confused with the nearby Château de Thorens. History The Château de Sales was the home of the Sales family in Thorens until the beginning of the 17th century, when they built and moved to the Château de Thorens, a few hundred metres away, where they still reside. The Château de Sales is known to have existed before 1249 and was remodelled in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was destroyed in 1630 on the orders of Louis XIII, Château de Thorens, appelé par erreur Château de Sales during his invasion of Savoy. This was in reprisal for the resistance of Louis Sales, younger brother of Saint Francis de Sales, captain-governor of the Château d'Annecy. The latter had refused to surrender the Annecy castle to the King's troops, commanded by Gaspard III de Coligny, Maréchal de Châtillon. In 1672, three nephews of Louis Sales, including Monseigneur Charles-Auguste de Sales, Prince-bishop of Geneva, built a chapel on the ruins of the Château de Sales, on the precise location of the room where Saint François de Sales had been born. In the 19th century, it was restored by the architect Ruphy for Count François de Roussy de Sales (1860–1943). A cellar was added in which were laid the ashes of his ancestors, until then buried in the church at Thorens (Saint Sébastien chapel). This chapel has since been the necropolis of the Roussy de Sales family. The last count of Thorens, Jean-François de Roussy de Sales (1928-1999), grandson of count François, is buried there with the greater part of his ancestors. Opposite the chapel, a cross shows visitors where Francis de Sales was supposedly inspired by God to create the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary.

It was the second public institution in London created to look after mentally ill people, after the Hospital of St. Mary of Bethlem (Bedlam), founded in 1246.St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics, Victorian London, Lee Jackson, Accessed July 2011 History 1896 map of Old Street showing a plan of the hospital. The first chief physician was Dr William Battie who was renowned as ‘an eccentric humorist’. He believed ‘the patients of this hospital shall not be exposed to publick view.’ Medical treatment consisted of cold plunge baths to shake lunatics out of their insanity. A system of non-restraint was professed, however manacles and other restraints were sometimes used. The hospital was originally housed in a converted foundry in Windmill Street, Upper Moorfields, close to Bedlam. It was designed by George Dance the Elder in 1750-1; after his death his son George Dance the Younger succeeded him as surveyor to the hospital. It was originally built for 25 patients, but was enlarged and by 1771 was overcrowded. A decision was made to build a larger hospital on a new site. The design was put out to competition, which was a novelty at the time. None of the competition entries was successful however, and Dance was asked to design the new building. In 1786 the hospital moved to Dance's purpose-built premises on Old Street, between Bath St and what is now the City Road roundabout. The building had a magnificent frontage of clamp brick, long,St Luke's Hospital in Moorfields The Drawings of John Soane, Sir John Soane's Museum Drawings, 2011, Accessed July 2011 which had a central entrance, with the male wards to the left and female wards to the right. The building contained single cells for 300 patients, each with small windows set high in the wall, no heating, and loose straw on wooden bedsteads. By 1865 it had a population of 150 to 160 patients, taken from the middle classes, its original purpose of supporting paupers having been abandoned. The proportion of cures at St. Luke's was 67 to 70 per cent compared to that of only 15 per cent at pauper lunatic asylums . Behind the main building were two gardens for the exercise of the less disturbed inmates, one for men and another for women. More dangerous residents were kept inside, or in their cells. The treatment regime consisted of cold plunge baths, and a focus on the gastrointestinal system with the administration of anti- spasmodics, emetics (to induce vomiting) and purgatives. All patients were transferred to other institutions or their homes in 1916, and the buildings were acquired by the Bank of England to become the St Luke's Printing Works, used for printing bank notes until the early 1950s.St Luke's Hospital, Old Street Road, Moorfields at Old London Maps, 2006. Accessed July 2011 The building was demolished in 1963. In 1922 it was suggested that a psychiatric unit should be instituted by the original St Luke's charity in cooperation with a general hospital. This led to the funding by the charity of both an out-patient clinic and a psychiatric in-patient ward at the Middlesex Hospital. A new St Luke's, the third, was opened at Woodside Avenue, Muswell Hill, in 1930 by Princess Helena Victoria. This was variously known as Woodside Nerve Hospital, St Luke's Woodside Hospital for Functional Nervous Disorders and from 1948 as St Luke's Woodside.St Luke's Hospital Index of English and Welsh Lunatic Asylums and Mental Hospitals, Andrew Roberts, Middlesex University. 2001 .

In the 1960s she joined the international concrete poetry movement. She participated in exhibitions all over the world, including the Venice Biennale (eight times from 1969 to 2001) and the Museum of Modern Art (1992). Biography Mirella Bentivoglio was born in Klagenfurt, Austria, to Italian parents. Her father, Ernesto Bertarelli, was a scientist and professor at the University of Pavia and an avid collector of books. Mirella grew up in Milan and studied in Italy, Switzerland and England. Although her studies were interrupted by World War II, she continued to expand her knowledge using her father's extensive library. She started her career as a poet when she was very young. She published her first collection of poems, Giardino, in 1943, but she waited until 1968 to publish her second poetry book. This unusually long period between the two publications was intentional, the result of a dissatisfaction with the rigidity of the printed word and its inability to fully represent the open and multifaceted experiences from which the poems emerged. In 1963 she published her first work as an art critic, a monographic study on the Lithuanian-born American artist Ben Shahn. As an art critic, artist and poet, in the 1960s she began to focus on the expressive visualization of language. At that time she joined the concrete poetry movement, and she started using alphabetic elements to create images. Examples of this creative period include Successo (Success), 1968, and Pagina-finestra (Window-Page), 1971. Bentivoglio also joined the visual poetry movement, that mix linguistic and iconic elements. Fiore Nero (Black Flower), 1971, well represents her visual poetry work. In the 1970s, Bentivoglio became particularly fascinated with the letters E and O, that in Italian respectively stand for the English words \\"and\\" and \\"or\\". E became a sign for community, connection, while O became a sign for identity and individuality. Few years later, she became increasingly involved with sculpture and performance art, making the letters evolve in three-dimensional forms: the E became the open book, while the O became the egg. Her first sculptural work that uses the book and the egg is Poema Totale (Total Poem), 1974. These two images recur in many of her later works, and appear in one of her most remarkable work, L'Ovo di Gubbio (The Egg of Gubbio), from 1976. In 1976 Bentivoglio created another work for the Italian town of Gubbio, titled Poesia all'albero (The Poem to the Tree). This performance art piece consisted of hoisting in the main square of the town a tree and inviting passers-by to write something on a piece of paper, and then to attach it to the tree. Bentivoglio then collected the papers and chose some among them to create a unique poem. All Bentivoglio's work is pervaded by a wry critique of Western societies, their patriarchal structures, obsession with material consumption, pollution of the environment and celebration of power over compassion. As a curator and a critic, she always worked to promote women artists. For the artist's 90th birthday, the National Gallery of Contemporary Art in Rome organized a retrospective about her work. At the time of her death, on 23 March 2017, Bentivoglio made her home and worked in Rome. She was 94.

It is part of the Albéniz Foundation.  History  The School was founded by Paloma O'Shea in 1991 in Madrid, in order to provide young Spanish musicians with a solid artistic education without the need to study abroad in other European countries. The governing bodies of the School are chaired by a Board of Trustees, established in 1991. This board reports directly to the Board of Trustees of the Albéniz Foundation. The Honour President of the School's Board is Queen Sophie. Besides the Board, the School has the support of an Academic Committee, made up of forty representative personalities of the cultural and political spheres, many of whom have been or are active members of the Faculty and Steering Committee. The School's location is in Plaza de Oriente, next to the Royal Palace and to Teatro Real. This location, situated in Requena street, housed once the Performing Arts and Dance School. The inception of the School can be found in the International Piano Competition Paloma O'Shea, which Paloma O’Shea created in 1972, and in the masterclasses organised by her from 1981 on in collaboration with Universidad Internacional de Verano Menéndez Pelayo, also in Santander. In the first steps of the project, as well as in the selection of the teaching staff, we counted on the advice of great masters such as Yehudi Menuhin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim, Zubin Mehta and Alicia de Larrocha, who also were or are part of the Academic Committee and of the Board of the School, as well as active consultants of the Chairs. The collaboration of Federico Sopeña and Enrique Franco, key figures of twentieth-century Spanish musical culture, was also essential.  Programs  The purpose is to train first-rate musicians, and all the necessary resources are made available to students and teachers with this end in mind. Originally the School offers individually tailored instruction to ensure that each student gets the training that he or she needs without following any pre-established program of studies, but in 2016 they introduced an official 4-year Bachelor of Music degree. It also offers post- graduate and pre-college preparatory training.  Teaching staff  The Reina Sofía Music School has teachers who have excelled in the exercise of the two aspects of their masters: art and education. Therefore, the faculty holding chairs is composed of leading figures of recognized international prestige. In addition to this regular team, each year professors invited to the Masterclasses Program complement the work of the school with different conceptions and perspectives.  Academic and artistic activity  The elaboration of academic organization follows a basic principle of classical training: personalized teaching. Only the personal assessment of the student by his teacher, assessed with other disciplines oriented to his global training dictated by the center's faculty, allow the design of a program tailored to the potential of the student. This program ensures musical learning in all its breadth integrating the different dimensions of the student's personality. In addition, one of the most characteristic aspects of the academic training in the School is its intense artistic activity. This means that, each academic year, the School organizes more than 300 concerts in its Auditorium and in different venues throughout Spain. The duration of the stay in the School depends directly on the student's possibilities of learning. Although the average is between two and four years, it can be said that students end when their teachers decide that they have already reached a certain artistic maturity. In addition, since the 2015-16 academic year, accredited studies are taught in the School within the Bologna program. The General Training Plan covers, therefore, the specific training of the instrumentalist or singer in the area of performance, completed with the academic disciplines, the obligatory artistic projection and the encouragement of the seminars proposed in the Complementary Training Department. This academic plan includes the following departments: Escuela Superior de Música Reina Sofía * Performance Department. * Academic Department. * Artistic Department. * Complementary Training Department. * Masterclasses Program. * Audiovisual Edition Program. The School has also developed an online education program in collaboration with five other important European schools, and has created an educational music portal web aimed at students, teachers, scholars or music fans in which masterclasses of great masters are offered. Thus, it contributes to preserve the historical musical heritage in the form of classes of such masters that would otherwise be lost. This website is called Magister Musicae.  Students  The main purpose of the School is universality and therefore it aspires to summon students of any social or geographical origin, with no other requirement than the talent and the delivery to a formative work designed to surpass the distinction between musical technique and artistic expression, putting the student in direct contact with the public. Its mission is not only to train soloists, but musicians capable of easily integrating into important chamber orchestral groups, winning prizes or accessing positions of Professors in schools and conservatories. Its work is designed for young people who in a few years will return to the same scenarios where they acted as students, already as excellent professionals. The School makes available to students from abroad or outside Madrid, the Student Residence, aimed at establishing relations between students, environment and teachers, with the idea that their artistic life and coexistence be more rewarding.

Six tools were included in this package: *MS-DOS Mode Configuration Wizard Customization Tool allowed users to configure Windows startup files without having to manually edit CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT; *Keyboard Remap reassigned functions to keys on the keyboard; *Logo Key Control configured MS-DOS games so that Windows would ignore the Windows logo key while games were running; *Conventional Memory Tracker to track and break down the amount of memory being allocated by virtual device drivers; *Windows Process Watcher (WinTop) monitored how much of CPU resources were taken by individual programs; *Time Zone Editor enabled the user to create and edit time zone entries for the Date/Time Control Panel applet. According to Raymond Chen, he wrote all of the Kernel Toys except for the Time Zone Editor, which came from the Windows NT Resource Kit. PowerToys for Windows XP PowerToys for Windows XP was the second version of the PowerToys set and brought major changes from the Windows 95 version. The tools in this set were available as separate downloads rather than in a single package. = Included components = , the following PowerToys for Windows XP were available: *Alt-Tab Replacement Task Switcher replaced the simpler Alt- Tab switcher with a more visual one which shows live window previews. *CD Slide Show Generator generated a slideshow from photos burned to a CD. *ClearType Tuner allowed customizing ClearType settings to make it easier to read text on the screen. *Color Control Panel Applet allowed managing color profiles, changing color profile associations for devices, viewing detailed properties for color profiles (including a 3D rendering of the color space gamut). *HTML Slide Show Wizard generated an HTML slideshow presentation. *Image Resizer allowed right-clicking on multiple image files inside Windows Explorer to batch resize them. *Open Command Window Here allowed starting a command prompt from any folder in Windows Explorer by right-clicking. *alt=Power Calculator was a more advanced graphical calculator application than the built-in Windows Calculator; it could evaluate more complex expressions, draw a Cartesian or polar graph of a function or convert units of measurements. Power Calculator could store and reuse pre-defined functions, of any arity. For example, a function could be set by \`cube(x) = x * x * x\`, and later it could be used in an expression like \`5 + cube(4)\`.MalekTips - Download a Free Graphing Calculator It did not evaluate every time an operator was entered. Rather, the entire expression must be entered for calculation. In the Numeric mode, it presented a visual keypad, in all other modes the expression had to be typed in. A scrolling text area maintained a history of all calculations. The advanced view allowed declaring and graphing functions, along with a list of all the saved functions. A flyout window provided the option of choosing either a Cartesian co-ordinate system or polar co- ordinates. It could also save a list of variables for use in expression. Unit conversions of the following types were supported: length, mass, time, velocity, and temperature. PowerToy Calc had support for typing calculations using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It could calculate up to 500 precision levels beyond the decimal point and supported complex numbers.PowerCalc in Windows 7 *RAW Image Thumbnailer and Viewer provided thumbnails, previews, printing, and metadata display for RAW images from within Windows Explorer. *SyncToy allowed synchronizing files and folders. *Taskbar Magnifier magnified part of the screen from the taskbar. *Tweak UI customized Windows XP's user interface and advanced settings. *Virtual Desktop Manager allowed switching between four virtual desktops from the taskbar. *Webcam Timershot took pictures at specified time intervals from a webcam. =Discontinued components= The following PowerToys for Windows XP were discontinued: *Background Switcher added a slideshow tab to Display properties and allows automatically changing the desktop wallpaper periodically. Although, Background Switcher is retired, a replacement, Wallpaper Changer, is available from Microsoft. *Internet Explorer Find Bar added toolbar to Internet Explorer that allowed users to search for keywords in a web page. This feature is natively supported by Internet Explorer 8. *ISO Image Burner burned ISO images to an Optical disc recorder. This feature is integrated into Windows 7. In addition, Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit includes two similar tools (CDBurn.exe and DVDBurn.exe). Although Microsoft has retired this Power Toy, it is available as the unauthorized ISO Recorder Power Toy. *Shell Audio Player was a Windows Media Player-based compact player which allows playing music from the taskbar. *Super-Fast User Switcher allowed Fast User Switching or logging on to a different account using the Windows key+Q combination without requiring to switch to the logon screen. *Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel could mount an ISO image as a virtual drive. It was designed for Windows XP, but it also worked with Windows Server 2003. It was a free alternative to software such as Alcohol 120%.  PowerToys for Windows 10  Windows 10 received PowerToys four years after its release. On May 8, 2019, Microsoft relaunched PowerToys and made them open-source on Github.GitHub - Microsoft/PowerToys: Windows system utilities to maximize productivity Users can add their own additions and customizations to PowerToys. The first preview release was in September 2019, which included FancyZones and the Windows key shortcut guide.GitHub - Microsoft/PowerToys/Releases = Included components = PowerToys for Windows 10 comes with the following utilities: * Color Picker adds a tool for HEX and RGB color identification. * FancyZones adds a window manager that makes it easier for users to create and use complex window layouts. *File Explorer (Preview Panes) adds SVG and Markdown previews to File Explorer. * Image Resizer adds a context menu to File Explorer for resizing images. * Keyboard Manager adds options for remapping keys and shortcuts. * PowerRename adds an option for users to rename files using search and replace or regular expression in File Explorer. * PowerToys Run adds a Spotlight-like tool that allows users to search for folders, files, applications, and other items. * Shortcut Guide adds a full screen overlay that allows the user to view the windows key shortcuts available in the current window.  Compatibility with Windows Vista, 7, and 8  PowerToys did not receive any releases supporting Windows Vista. Making equivalent calls to various Windows APIs were still possible though and enabling third-party applications to be implemented with the same, or a subset, of the original functionality. Neither Windows 7, Windows 8 nor Windows 8.1 received official support either. Not accounting for time spent developing Windows Vista, PowerToys was not updated for over 12 years, before being re-released as open source software for Windows 10. PowerToys for other Microsoft products Microsoft also released PowerToys for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows XP Media Center Edition. A set of PowerToys for Windows Media Player was released as part of the Windows Media Player Bonus Pack (for Windows XP), consisting of five tools to \\"provide a variety of enhancements to Windows Media Player.\\" Finally, Microsoft has also released PowerToys for Windows Mobile, Visual Studio and OneNote.

The protein belongs to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (ACD). It catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA and carbon dioxide in the degradative pathway of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine, and L-tryptophan metabolism. It uses electron transfer flavoprotein as its electron acceptor. The enzyme exists in the mitochondrial matrix as a homotetramer of 45-kD subunits. Mutations in this gene result in the metabolic disorder glutaric aciduria type 1, which is also known as glutaric acidemia type I. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Structure GCDH is a tetramer with tetrahedral symmetry, which allows it to be seen as a dimer of dimers. Its structure is very similar to other ACDs but the overall polypeptide fold of the GCDH is made up of three domains: an alpha-helical bundle amino-terminal domain, a beta-sheet domain in the middle, and another alpha-helical domain at the carboxyl terminus. The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is located at the junction between the middle beta-strand and the carboxyl terminal alpha-helix domain of one subunit and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the neighboring subunit. The most distinct difference between GCDH and other ACDs in terms of structure is the carboxyl and amino-terminal regions of the monomer and in the loop between beta-strands 4 and 5 because it is only made up of four residues, whereas other ACDs have much more. The substrate-binding pocket is filled with a string of three water molecules, which gets displaced when the substrate binds to the enzyme. The binding pocket is also smaller than some of the other ACD binding pockets because it is responsible for the chain-length specificity of GCDH for alternate substrates. The GCDH gene is mapped onto 19p13.2 and has an exon count of 15.  Function  GCDH is mainly known for the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA and carbon dioxide, which is common in the mitochondrial oxidation of lysine, tryptophan, and hydroxylysine. The way it completes this task is through a series of physical, chemical, and electron-transfer steps. It first binds glutaryl-CoA substrate to the oxidized form of the enzyme and abstracts the alpha-proton of the substrate by the Glu370 catalytic base. Hydride is then transferred from the beta-carbon of the substrate to the N(5) of the FAD, yielding the 2e−-reduced form of FAD. Thus, this allows for the decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA, an enzyme-bound intermediate, by breaking the Cγ-Cδ bond, resulting in formation of a dienolate anion, a proton, and CO2. The dienolate intermediate is protonated, resulting in crotonyl-CoA and a release of products from the active site. Finally, the 2e−-reduced form of FAD is oxidized to two 1e− steps by an external electron acceptor to complete the turnover. Clinical significance Mutations in the GCDH gene can lead to defects in the enzyme encoded by it which leads to the formation and accumulation of the metabolites glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid as well as glutarylcarnitine in body fluids, which essentially leads to glutaric aciduria type I, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. Symptoms for this disease include: macrocephaly, acute encephalitis-like crises, spasticity, dystonia, choreoathetosis, ataxia, dyskinesia and seizure and are prevalent one in every 100,000 individuals. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal of GCDH have been most identified in patients with glutaric aciduria type I; more specifically, mutations in Ala389Val, Ala389Glu, Thr385Met, Ala377Val, and Ala377Thr all seem to be associated with the disorder because they dissociate to inactive monomers and/or dimers.

He is the father of David Holloway, who also played professional football. Early life Holloway was a standout athlete at Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland, playing on the 1976 state championship football team and breaking the school record in the shot put. He was recruited by Bill Walsh to Stanford University, where he earned All- American honors. New England Patriots Holloway (far right) in 1985 with then-Boston City Councilor Thomas Menino (far left), Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis (second from left), and Boston mayor Raymond Flynn (second from right) Brian Holloway was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round (19th overall) of the 1981 NFL Draft out of Stanford University. As a rookie in 1981 he started 5 of 16 games. In the strike-shortened 1982 NFL season, Holloway started 9 of 9 games as he became the starting left offensive tackle , next to guard John Hannah, and missed only one start up to the end of the 1986 NFL season. In the 1982-83 NFL playoffs, the Patriots lost to the Miami Dolphins in a wild-card game. They did not make the playoffs in 1983 and 1984 but did so in 1985. After beating the New York Jets in a wild-card game of the 1985-86 NFL playoffs, the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Raiders on the road in the divisional round with a strong running game, amassing 156 yards, 104 by running back Craig James behind Holloway and Hannah. The line then destroyed the Miami Dolphins' run defense on the road by accumulating 255 yards, 105 of them by James, winning the AFC title. However, they could not run over the legendary Chicago Bears defense of 1985 in Super Bowl XX, Holloway having a hard time with the formidably swift right defensive end Richard Dent, who would be named Most Valuable Player of the game. After finishing with a won-lost record of 11-5 and winning the AFC East division, New England fell short against the Denver Broncos, led by quarterback John Elway, in a divisional round of the 1986-87 NFL playoffs. Holloway was one of the most dominating offensive tackles in his era, as indicated in part by three Pro Bowl selections from 1983 to 1985. Los Angeles Raiders Brian Holloway went to play left offensive tackle with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1987 and 1988 after being traded to the Raiders on September 2 1987 in exchange for the Raiders' fifth-round selection in the 1988 NFL Draft. In the strike-shortened 1987 NFL season, he started 8 of 12 games, but did not start in 1988, his final year in the NFL, replaced at that position by Don Mosebar. Personal Holloway had a home in Stephentown, New York for over 30 years, while living at his Florida residence in Tampa. While he was in Tampa on August 31, 2013, 500 + local high school students broke into his New York house and caused damage that Holloway says exceeds $20,000 while throwing a party. In response, Holloway set up a website, www.helpmesave300.com, to reach out to those who caused the damage in a positive way; instead, he received threats from their parents. Six people were arrested September 26, 2013 in connection with the partygoers who trashed the home. In October 2013, the Holloway home sold at foreclosure auction to the Berkshire Bank, which purchased it for $400,000. It was the sole bidder on the property. After the auction, the Albany Times Union reported that Holloway owed Berkshire Bank $1,006,348.80. He had also built up a backlog of unpaid property and school taxes, totaling $45,131.

The decision to devote the year 2001 to mobilization against racism and xenophobia was taken by the General Assembly on December 9, 1998 and was linked to the decision to organize a conference, the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in the same year. In its resolution (A/RES/53/132) the General Assembly stated that the observance was \\"aimed at drawing the world’s attention to the objectives of the World Conference and giving new momentum to the political commitment to the elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance\\". The conference was held in Durban, South Africa. 7,000 representatives from civil society participated in an NGO Forum from August 28 to 31, 2001. The governmental meeting was held from August 31 to September 7, 2001. A declaration and programme of action was adopted on September 8.

It establishes an international inspection system for places of detention modeled on the system that has existed in Europe since 1987 (the Committee for the Prevention of Torture). The OPCAT was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 18 December 2002, and it entered into force on 22 June 2006. As of June 2019, the Protocol has 76 signatories and 90 parties. History The idea for this scheme of torture prevention goes back to the Swiss Committee for the Prevention of Torture (today Association for the Prevention of Torture, APT), founded in 1977 by Jean-Jacques Gautier in Geneva. It envisaged the establishment of a worldwide system of inspection of places of detention, which later took the form of an Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984). For a long time, however, the necessary support for such an optional protocol was not forthcoming. As a consequence, the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT) had at its disposal only relatively weak instruments: it could analyse and discuss the self-reports of the respective governments and create the institution of a Special Rapporteur on Torture. But neither CAT nor its Special Rapporteur had the power to visit countries, let alone inspect prisons, without the respective government's permission. In 1987, the Council of Europe realized the original idea on a regional level with its European Convention for the Prevention of Torture. On this basis, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture has demonstrated that regular visits, reports and recommendations to the governments as well as the publication of these reports and the governments' reactions the viability of this model. This in turn led to a breakthrough within the United Nations: OPCAT was created and opened for signatures on 18 December 2002 by the UN General Assembly. After ratification by 20 states, the Optional Protocol came into force on 22 June 2006. Ratification status As of October 2019, 90 states have ratified the protocol: Afghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, the Central African Republic, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, State of Palestine, Sweden, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.

Pink tulips massed against the east colonnade of the White House. Summer in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden. Magnolia and Littleleaf lindens underplanted with ageratum and boxwood. The white painted cast iron Rococo Revival garden bench has been on the White House grounds since 1850. Fall in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden. The brick paved walk along the east colonnade is bordered with bronze colored spoon chrysanthemumStarlet. The Jacqueline Kennedy Garden is located at the White House south of the East Colonnade. The garden balances the Rose Garden on the west side of the White House. History Edith Carow Roosevelt, who had established her \\"Colonial Garden\\" on the site of the present Rose Garden, oversaw a similar but less formal planting on the east side, the site of the present Jacqueline Kennedy Garden. The origins of the Garden's present form initially began in 1913 with First Lady Ellen Louise Axson Wilson, at the time taking to calling it the East Garden, which saw Mrs. Wilson's design featuring a modest central lily pond. However, this work on the Garden was not completed until after the first lady had died in 1914, resulting in an area 36 by 19 meters (118x62 feet). In the nearly half a century which followed, the grounds to the White House fell into disrepair. When the Kennedy administration came to office the ill-kempt state of the gardens drew the focus of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who worked with Rachel Lambert Mellon and Perry Wheeler on the redesign and replanting of the entire Rose and East Gardens. By the time of President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, the Rose Garden had been completed, while revitalization on the East Garden was still a work in progress. To further honor Jacqueline Kennedy's contributions to the White House and its grounds, her immediate successor, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, renamed the East Garden as the \\"Jacqueline Kennedy Garden\\" during a ceremony on 22 April 1965. On July 27, 2020, First Lady Melania Trump announced an overhaul of the Rose Garden. The first lady said a “comprehensive renovation” was needed after decades of use for weddings, state dinners and countless presidential news conferences, statements and Thanksgiving turkey pardons. On August 22, 2020, a major renovation involved the removal of the crabapple trees, among other colorful plants and flowers, and their replacement with ornamental grass and hedges. Following the renovation, mixed reaction to the changes were voiced on various social media platforms. Design and horticulture Rachel Lambert Mellon created a space with a more defined central lawn, bordered by flower beds planted in a French style, but largely using American botanical specimens. Though more formal than the previous East Garden, the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden paid tribute to Beatrix Farrand's work in its use of a more organic structure, planting masses of the same plants in drifts, and use of foliage plants like ornamental grasses and caladiums. The garden followed a layout established by Mellon. Each flower bed was planted with a series of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central lawn was edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants included delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers were interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden included jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter. Official and informal use Like the Rose Garden, the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden was used for events. The president used the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden for awards ceremonies. Both Lady Bird Johnson and Pat Nixon favored use of the garden for parties and teas. First Lady Hillary Clinton exhibited contemporary sculpture in the garden. References  Further reading  *The White House: An Historic Guide.

The aim is to preserve the classes that take place each day at the Queen Sofía College of Music and make them accessible to a wider audience. In the year 2000, the Spanish Ministry for Science and Technology supported the project with a considerable donation under the aegis of the PROFIT programme. The resulting three years of research and development, which focused on the digitization, cataloguing, compression and high-quality broadcasting of the videos on the internet, gave rise to HTCMedia, a tool which manages large quantities of video information. This has been the cornerstone of the creation of Magister Musicae. The master classes are recorded in the music schools. These lessons are scrupulously analyzed by music specialists, catalogued by work and by movement, then broken down into teaching units of no more than six minutes’ duration. This system of classification allows the visitor to the site to go directly to the section of the class that is of interest, and to be able to link with a number of classes given by various teachers.

Western portico of the Parliament Building featuring the \\"Department Frieze\\". Rådhusgränd (Swedish: \\"Town Hall Alley\\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from the junction between the street Myntgatan and the square Riddarhustorget, and passing between the Bonde Palace and Kanslihuset (\\"The Chancellery House\\"), it leads north to the bridge Vasabron, while forming a parallel street to Riddarhusgränd. Along the waterfront north of the alley passes the quay Kanslikajen. The alley is named after the vicinity to the Bonde Palace, originally built in 1662-1667 as the private residence of Gustaf Bonde (1620–1667), but serving as the Stockholm Town House during the period 1732–1915. The southern wings of the buildings are additions from 1754. While the building's present eastern front, today hiding the Supreme Court, is less than extrovert, it did include an entrance to a \\"public boudoir\\" during the 18th and most of the 19th century. The alley was, however, entirely closed during the period 1850–1913, to accommodate the prison of the Town Hall, finally demolished in 1929-1930 to give space to Kanslihuset, the offices of the Parliament. In contrast, the voluminous and heavy mass of Kanslihuset on the alley's eastern side, designed by Wolter Gahn and Gustaf Clason and completed in 1936, opens up to the alley in form of the western end of the series of courtyards which pierces the building.

It is listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Lundin Energy had of oil equivalent of proven plus probable reserves at the end of 2019 and contingent resources amounted to of oil equivalent. The company's commercial success is overshadowed by a Swedish war crimes investigation into its past operations in Sudan. Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter are the suspects of the preliminary investigation. In April 2020, the company changed its name from Lundin Petroleum AB to Lundin Energy AB. Operations Lundin Energy is fully focused on Norway where the company holds over 60 licences. The majority are exploration licences and about ten percent are producing fields. Core areas are the Utsira High Area and Alvheim in the North Sea and the Loppa High in the southern Barents Sea. In 2010, Lundin Energy discovered the Johan Sverdrup oil field, one of the largest oil discoveries ever made on the Norwegian continental shelf. Lundin Energy has a 20 percent working interest in the Johan Sverdrup oil field development project. Production from Phase 1 started on the 5th of October 2019 and reached plateau in April 2020, with plateau production of 470 thousand barrels of oil per day. Phase 2 will add another processing platform to the field centre which is estimated to increase the processing capacity for the full field to 690 thousand barrels of oil per day. Phase 2 is scheduled to start production in 2022. Another important part of Lundin Energy´s production is the Edvard Grieg oil field, located in PL338 on the Utsira High in the central North Sea. The Edvard Grieg field was discovered in 2007 and started production in November 2015. Another production hub is in the Alvheim area, located in the central part of the North Sea, and production from the fields in this hub started in 2008, 2010 and 2015. Lundin Energy is one of the largest operated acreage holders and has been one of the most active explorers in Norway over the past 10 years. A status that continues today. The largest discoveries have been made in the Utsira High (Johan Sverdrup oil field, Edvard Grieg oil field) and in the southern Barents Sea (the Alta, Gohta and Filicudi discoveries).  Decarbonisation Strategy  Lundin Energy presented its Decarbonisation Strategy in January 2020, targeting carbon neutrality by 2030. With the Decarbonisation Strategy, the Company has formalised its ongoing commitment to reduce its carbon footprint to the lowest possible levels, through an effective combination of emissions reductions, energy efficiency, targeted research and development and carbon capture mechanisms. Investment in renewable energy projects has also been undertaken to replace the Company´s net electricity consumption. In accordance with the strategy, the Company will limit average operated and non-operated portfolio carbon intensity to below 4kg CO2 per boe and from 2023 to below 2kg CO2 per boe. History The Lundin family has been involved in oil exploration and production for over thirty years. Lundin Petroleum can trace its roots back to the early eighties in the form of International Petroleum, then International Petroleum Corporation, followed by Lundin Oil in the late nineties before emerging as Lundin Petroleum in 2001. The company was formed in 2001 following the takeover of Lundin Oil AB by Canadian independent Talisman Energy, Lundin Petroleum AB is a Swedish oil company traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in Block 5A to Petronas Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the Sirte Basin, Libya. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100 km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately of oil equivalent. In Tunisia, the Oudna field development (Lundin Petroleum 40% working interest) was successfully completed and production commenced in November 2006. In 2002, Lundin Petroleum acquired Coparex International from BNP Paribas, adding exploration and production assets in France, Netherlands, Tunisia, Venezuela, Indonesia and Albania to the existing portfolio. The acquisition transformed Lundin Petroleum from a pure exploration company into a larger E&P; player. In early 2003, Lundin Petroleum entered Norway for the first time by acquiring 75 percent of the shareholding in Norwegian OER oil. In 2004, Lundin Petroleum acquired a portfolio of producing assets in the UK from DNO AS, doubling Lundin Petroleum's reserves to of oil equivalent and increased production to per day of oil equivalent. In April 2010 it demerged its assets on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf into Petrofac's Energy Developments unit to form the stand-alone company EnQuest. In 2010, Lundin Petroleum made a large discovery on the Avaldsnes prospect in PL501 on the Utsira High in the North Sea, estimated to contain recoverable resources of of oil equivalent. The discovery was later renamed Johan Sverdrup oil field. In 2014, Lundin Petroleum made an oil and gas discovery on the Alta prospect in PL609 on the Loppa High in the southern Barents Sea. The discovery is located 20 km northeast of the Gohta discovery well and some 160 km from the Norwegian coast and is estimated to contain resources of of oil equivalent. In February 2015, it has started drilling exploration well 16/1-24, located in the Gemini prospect of the North Sea. The well is located in PL338C south-west of the Edvard Grieg field, offshore Norway. It will test the reservoir properties and hydrocarbon potential of Lower Paleocene aged sandstones of the Ty Formation. The Gemini prospect is estimated to contain unrisked, gross prospective resources of of oil equivalent. The Island Innovator semi-submersible drilling rig will be used to drill the well to a planned total depth of 2,192m below mean sea level. The Gemini exploration well was completed as a dry well in March 2015. In 2015, three field developments were completed and started production: the Bøyla field and the Edvard Grieg oil field in Norway and the Bertam field in Malaysia. In April 2017, Lundin Petroleum spun-off its producing assets outside of Norway into a new company called International Petroleum Corporation (IPC). Following the spin-off, Lundin Petroleum is a fully Norway focused company. Following the approval by the AGM 2020, the company changed its name from Lundin Petroleum to Lundin Energy, to better reflect its decarbonization strategy and broadening of its energy mix.  Leadership  Founder Adolf H. Lundin has founded also Lundin Mining in 1994.Company History Lunding mining. Investors Adolf H. Lundin, who was a pioneer in the oil and mining industries, died in 2006 at the age of 73. In June 2015, Alex Schneiter was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Lundin Petroleum, effective October 2015. In August 2020, Lundin Energy announced the appointment of Nick Walker as the company's new president and CEO, effective January 1, 2021. Criticism In her book Affärer i blod och olja: Lundin Petroleum i Afrika (Business in blood and oil: Lundin Petroleum in Africa) journalist Kerstin Lundell claims that the company had been complicit in several crimes against humanity, including death shootings and the burning of villages. In June 2010, the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) published the report Unpaid Debt, which called upon the governments of Sweden, Austria and Malaysia to look into allegations that the companies Lundin Petroleum, OMV, and Petronas have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity whilst operating in Block 5A, South Sudan (then Sudan) between 1997-2003. The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement. Approximately 12.000 people died and 160.000 were violently displaced from their land and homes, many forever. Satellite pictures taken between 1994 and 2003 show that the activities of the three oil companies in Sudan coincided with a spectacular drop in agricultural land use in their area of operation. Also in June 2010, the Swedish public prosecutor for international crimes opened a criminal investigation into links between Sweden and the reported crimes. In 2016, Lundin Petroleum's Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter were informed that they were the suspects of the investigation. Sweden’s Government gave the green light for the Public Prosecutor in October 2018 to indict the two top executives On 1 November 2018, the Swedish Prosecution Authority notified Lundin Petroleum AB that the company may be liable to a corporate fine and forfeiture of economic benefits of SEK 3,285 (app. € 315 million) for involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Consequently, the company itself will also be charged albeit indirectly, and will be legally represented in court. On 15 November 2018 the suspects were served with the draft charges and the case files. They will be indicted for aiding and abetting international crimes and may face life imprisonment if found guilty. The trial is likely to begin by the end of 2020 and may take several years. The Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon Lundin and its shareholders to pay off their debt. A conviction in Sweden may provide remedy and reparation for a few victims of human rights violations who will be witnesses in court, but not for the app. 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. Lundin Energy endorses the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, acknowledging the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to. The company has never refuted publicly reported incriminating facts. Nor has it substantiated its claim that its activities contributed to the improvement of the lives of the people of Sudan.. It never showed an interest in the consequences of the oil war for the communities in its concession area. The company maintains a website about its activities in Sudan. Criticism has also been directed towards former Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt, a former board member for the company, responsible for ethics.PM Nilsson, \\"Bildt måste gå\\" , Expressen, 11 January 2007 .Fredrik Malm, \\"Bildt måste byta politik eller avgå\\", Expressen, 15 January 2007 . Ethiopia arrested two Swedish journalist Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye and held them for 14 months before the release. Conflict Ethiopian Judicial Authority v Swedish journalists 2011 was caused as the journalist studied report of human rights violation in the Ogaden in connection with activities of Lundin Petroleum.Reporters Without Borders hails Swedish journalists’ release Reporters Without Borders 10 September 2012 The trial against Lundin may become a landmark case because of the novelty and complexity of the legal issues that the Swedish court will have to decide. It would be the first time since the Nuremberg trails that a multibillion-dollar company were to be charged for international crimes. The court is likely to answer a number of important legal questions, including about the individual criminal liability of corporate executives vs. corporate criminal liability of organisations, the applicable standard of proof for international crimes before a national court, and the question whether a lack of due diligence is sufficient for a finding of guilt. On 23 may 2019, the T.M.C. Asser Institute for International Law in The Hague organized a Towards criminal liability of corporations for human rights violations: The Lundin case in Sweden. Thomas Alstrand from the Swedish Prosecution Authority in Gothenburg on 13 February 2019 announced that a second criminal investigation had been opened into threats and acts of violence against witnesses in the Lundin war crimes investigation. They have allegedly been pressured not to testify in court. Several witnesses have been granted asylum in safe countries through UNHCR supported emergency protection procedures. The company has confirmed that its CEO and Chairman have been officially informed by the prosecutor about the allegation, noting that it believes that it is completely unfounded. Witness tampering is usually intended to prevent the truth from being exposed in court. The second investigation into obstruction of justice seems to contradict the company’s assertions of its good faith cooperation with the war crimes investigation. Once court hearings commence in Sweden, the Dutch peace organization PAX and Swedish NGO Global Idé will provide daily English language coverage of proceedings, expert analyses and comments on the website Unpaid Debt.

Egypt, 1891. Shellal () is a small ancient village on the banks of the Nile, south of Aswan in Upper Egypt. It was the traditional northern frontier of the Nubian region with both the Egyptian Empire and the Roman Empire. During the period of ancient Egypt, it was a very important quarry area for granite production. Nowadays it is possible to see some unfinished granite works on the site (that is soon to become an open-air museum); some of the objects on display include incomplete statues of Osiris and Ramesses II and unfinished Roman baths. Shellal was mentioned in a text dating from the 6th century AD where the king of Nobatia prides himself on having driven Blemmyes out from his country northwards from Ibrim to Shellal, on the frontier with Roman Egypt. It was also an important city during the Muslim Arab early domination; in particular there are some ancient minarets dating from the 11th century that are now submerged under the waters of Lake Nasser. These minarets are known to reflect the direct influence of the Hijaz region of Arabia, rather that the domination of the powers of Lower Egypt. Transport During the 19th century, the Luxor-Aswan railroad line was connected with a narrow-gauge line from Aswan to Shellal which had been constructed in 1884 by the British as a military line during the first Sudan Campaign to accelerate transport of military stores past the First Cataract. Later the final southern station in the Egyptian railroad network was converted to standard gauge. In the late 19th century, Victoria of Baden, Queen Victoria of Sweden, visited Egypt and traveled south to Shellal where she took a now famous photograph of the site on the late afternoon of 15 February 1891. The photograph is the first known graphic document in existence, depicting the waters of the Nile at Shellal. Today Shellal has a small port where boats depart to the near Philae temple and has a small market where the shopkeepers wait for the tourists returning from the temple.

Overview  The foundations of this work may be traced to philosopher and sociologist George Herbert Mead, whose work provided major insights into the formation of mind, concepts of self and other, and the internalization of society in individual social beings, viewing these as emerging out of human interaction and communication.(Walter Buckley, 1996; Norbert Wiley, 1994) Recent work (Buckley, 1996; Tom R. Burns and Erik Engdahl, 1998a, 1998b, Burns et al., 2003, among others) brings such a sociological and social psychological perspective to bear on several key aspects of consciousness, and in doing so inverts explanation: starting from collective phenomena, one ends up analyzing individual consciousness. In making this inversion, they do not totally reject reductionist approaches—nor deny their value in identifying the \\"hardware\\" through which collective and social psychological processes operate. However, they would reject the idea that a complete explanation can be formulated on the basis of either purely sociological mechanisms or underlying physical, chemical, neurological, hormonal, or psychological factors and processes. For a critique of reductionism from the perspective of modern physics and biology see Morowitz (1981). The biological and bio-physical bases of human life are recognized. However, these approaches cannot be relied on entirely. In part, the level of analysis is misdirected when it comes to some classes of consciousness phenomena; most of the natural science approaches focus on the wrong levels and the wrong factors with which to explain some of the most mysterious and paradoxical features of human consciousness.  Theory  The sociological approach (Buckley, 1996; Burns and Engdahl (1998a, 1998b), Wiley, 1994, 1986 among others) emphasizes the importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. This theoretical approach argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social, and this is no less true of our experiences of \\"collective consciousness\\" than it is of our experiences of individual consciousness. The theory suggests that the problem of consciousness can be approached fruitfully by beginning with the human group and collective phenomena: community, language, language-based communication, institutional, and cultural arrangements.(Wiley, 1986) A collective is a group or population of individuals that possesses or develops through communication collective representations or models of \\"we\\" as opposed to \\"them\\": a group, community, organization, or nation is contrasted to \\"other\\"; its values and goals, its structure and modes of operating, its relation to its environment and other agents, its potentialities and weaknesses, strategies and developments, and so on. A collective has the capacity in its collective representations and communications about what characterizes it, or what (and how) this self perceives, judges, or does, or what it can (and cannot) do, or should do (or should not do). It monitors its activities, its achievements and failures, and also to a greater or lesser extent, analyzes and discusses itself as a defined and developing collective agent. This is what is meant by self-reflectivity. Such reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective selves (as we discuss below, there are also conversations about the selves of individuals, defining, justifying, and stigmatizing them). = Human consciousness as a reflective activity = Human consciousness in at least one major sense is a type of reflective activity. It entails the capacity to observe, monitor, judge, and decide about the collective self. This is a basis for maintaining a particular collective as it is understood or represented; it is a basis for re-orienting and re-organizing the collective self in response to performance failings or profound crisis (economic, political, cultural). Collective reflectivity emerges then as a function of a group or organization producing and making use of collective representations of the self in its discussions, critical reflections, planning, and actions. =Individual consciousness= Individual consciousness is the normal outcome of processes of collective naming, classifying, monitoring, judging, and reflecting on the individual members of the group or organization. And an individual in a collective context learns to participate in discussions and discourses about \\"themself\\", that is, group reflections on themself, their appearance, their orientations and attitudes, their strategies and conduct. Thus, an individual learns (in line with George Herbert Mead's earlier formulations) a naming and classification of themself (self-description and identity) and a characterization of their judgments, actions, and predispositions. In acquiring a language and conceptual framework for this mode of activity along with experience and skills in reflective discussion they develop a capability of inner reflection and inner dialog about themself. These are characteristic features of a particular type of individual \\"consciousness\\". This conception points up the socially constructed character of key properties of the human mind, realized through processes of social interaction and social construction. In sum, individual self-representation, self-reference, self- reflectivity, and experiences of consciousness, derive from the collective experience.(Burns and Engdahl, 1998b; Wiley, 1986) =Construction of selves through reflectivity= Self-reflectivity as a type of consciousness often facilitates critical examination and re-construction of selves, collective as well as individual. This plays an essential role in human communities (as well as individual beings) in the face of systematic or highly risky performance failures or new types of problems. Through self-reflection, agents may manage in the course of directed problem-solving to develop more effective institutional arrangements, for instance, large-scale means of social coordination such as administration, democratic association, or markets.  Relationship with social organization  Language-based collective representations of the past as well as of the future, enable agents to escape the present, to enter into future as well as past imagined worlds, and to reflect together on these worlds. Moreover, in relation to the past, present, and future, the agents may generate alternative representations. These alternative constructions imagined, discussed, struggled over, and tested, make for the generation of variety, a major input into evolutionary processes, as discussed elsewhere.(Burns et al., 2003; Burns and Dietz, 1992) Such variety may also lead to social conflicts, as agents disagree about representations, or oppose the implications or remedies to problems proposed by particular agents. This opens the way for political struggles about alternative conceptions and solutions (where democratic politics entails at times collective self-reflectivity par excellence). In general, such processes enhance the collective capacity to deal with new challenges and crises. Thus, a collective has potentially a rich basis not only for talking about, discussing, agreeing (or disagreeing) about a variety of objects including the \\"collective self\\" as well as particular \\"individual selves\\"; but it also has a means to conceptualize and develop alternative types of social relationships, effective forms of leadership, coordination and control, and, in general, new normative orders and institutional arrangements. Collectives can even develop their potentialities for collective representation and self-reflectivity, for instance through innovations in information and accounting systems and processes of social accountability. These potentialities enable systematic, directed problem-solving, and the generation of variety and complex strategies. In particular selective environments, these make for major evolutionary advantages. = Oppressive reflectivity = The powerful tool of collective reflectivity must be seen as a double-edged sword in relation to expanding freedom of opportunity and variability, on the one hand, and, on the other, imposing particular constraints and limiting variability. Collective representations and reflectivity and directed problem-solving based on them may prevent human groups from experiencing or discovering the un-represented and the unnamed; unrecognized or poorly defined problems cannot be dealt with (as discussed elsewhere,(Burns et al., 2003) for instance, in the case of failures of accounting systems to recognize or take into account important social and environmental conditions and developments). Reflective and problem- solving powers may then be distorted, the generation of alternatives and varieties narrow and largely ineffective, and social innovation and transformation misdirected and possibly self-destructive. Thus, the presumed evolutionary advantages of human reflectivity must be qualified or viewed as conditional. Outlooks In sum, recent research, building on the work of George Herbert Mead, suggests that a sociological and social psychological perspective can be a point of departure with which to define and analyze certain forms of human consciousness, or more precisely, one class of consciousness phenomena, namely verbalized reflectivity: monitoring, discussing, judging and re-orienting and re-organizing self; representing and analyzing what characterizes the self, what self perceives, judges, could do, should do (or should not do)). The \\"hard problem\\" of consciousness (Chalmers, 1995) can be approached fruitfully by beginning with the human group and collective phenomena: community, language, language-based communication, institutional and cultural arrangements, collective representations, self- conceptions, and self-referentiality. Collective reflectivity emerges as a function of an organization or group producing and making use of collective representations of the self (\\"we\\", our group, community, organization, nation) in its discussions, critical reflections, and decision-making. A collective monitors and discusses its activities, achievements and failures, and reflects on itself as a defined, acting, and developing collective being. This reflectivity is encoded in language and developed in conversations about collective (as well as individual) selves. Individual consciousness is seen as deriving from the processes of collective naming, classifying, monitoring, judging, reflecting on, and conducting discussions and discourses about, the individual themself. In acquiring a language and conceptual framework for this mode of activity—along with skills and experiences in reflective discussion—they develop a capability of inner reflection and inner discourse about self, which are characteristic features of individual consciousness. One can also distinguish multiple modes of individual awareness and consciousness, distinguishing awareness from consciousness proper, and also identifying pre- and sub-conscious levels.(Burns and Engdahl, 1998b) This points up the complexity of the human mind, in part because of its elaboration through processes of social interaction and construction.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are sometimes dehorned for economic and safety reasons. Disbudding is a different process with similar results; it cauterizes and thus destroys horn buds before they have grown into horns. Disbudding is commonly performed early in an animal's life, as are other procedures such as docking and castration. Many breeds of cattle and sheep are naturally hornless. The polled gene can occur naturally in particular breeds or easily manipulated during breeding to lack horns, therefore do not need to be dehorned or disbudded. Although polling is common among cattle and sheep, a variety of livestock species cannot easily be bred to lack horns naturally. In one case, the poll gene in goats was linked to hermaphrodism in a single study several decades ago, although fertile polled goats have been bred. Horns are removed because they can pose a risk to humans, other animals and to the bearers of the horns themselves (horns are sometimes caught in fences or prevent feeding). Dehorning is normally performed with local anesthesia and sedation by a veterinarian or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and autumn to avoid fly season. In very large horns, \\"tipping\\" (removal of the tip of the horn) may be recommended to minimize bleeding. Dehorning is not routinely performed, since it is a difficult and painful process for the animal. Instead, most breeders disbud their animals while young, when the process is quick and easy. Dehorning is controversial because of the pain it causes. Rationale =Removal= Reasons invoked in support of dehorning animals include the following: *Horns may cause injuries to handlers or other animals. *Horned animals take up more space, causing issues at the feed bunk and during transportation. *Horned animals may require specialized equipment, such as feeders and angulate crushes. *In some breeds and in some individuals, horns may grow towards the head, eventually causing injury. *Horns may become broken, causing blood loss and potential for infection. *Horned animals may become trapped in fences or vegetation, causing self-injury. =Remaining horned= Arguments against dehorning include the following: *Dehorning (removing fully grown horns) without the use of anesthesia is extremely painful to the animal. A 2011 study that surveyed 639 farmers found that 52% of farmers reported that disbudding caused pain lasting more than 6 hours, that only 10 percent of the farmers used local anesthesia before cauterization, 5 percent provided calves with postoperative analgesia, and that farmers \\"indicated limited willingness to pay the cost of analgesia or to call a veterinarian to perform the procedure.\\" *Horned livestock are better able to defend themselves and their young from predators such as wolves and dogs. *Horns provide a secure point for roping or holding the animal's head. *Horns are traditional in some breeds, and breed standards may require their presence (for example, Texas Longhorn, Highland and White Park cattle). *In some areas horns are of cultural significance, often being decorated or even trained into strange shapes. *Some types of yokes used by draught oxen require the presence of horns. *In very hot climates, horns are useful for thermoregulation and cooling. Procedure Dehorning can be performed on older animals and is normally performed with local anesthesia (cornual nerve block) by a veterinarian or a trained professional. Removal of larger horns is usually performed during spring and autumn to avoid fly season. Sedation may be recommended, especially for larger animals that require increased restraint. Use of longer-term pain medicine, like nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, is being researched in the US to ensure food safety. For mature cattle that were not dehorned when they were young, another common practice to cut off only the pointed end of the horn. This practice is called horn tipping; it is less stressful on the animal because there is no blood loss and the horn is cut off where there are no longer any nerve endings. This practice does not eliminate the bruising damage done by the horns when cows fight, but it does eliminate the risk of puncture wounds and eye loss from pointed horns. Disbudding minimizes discomfort and risk, and is performed when horns are small \\"buds\\" by one of several methods: *Cauterization is the process of killing the growth ring of the horn using heat. This process is done when cattle are very young, no more than three or four weeks old—that way the horns are not very big. The earlier in the calf's life cauterization is done, the less pain and stress is inflicted on the calf. Cauterization is usually done with a dehorning hot iron after the area is numbed with local anesthesia. *A curved knife can be used to cut the horn off when the calf is younger than a couple of months old. It is a simple procedure where the horn and the growth ring is cut off to remove the horn. *For under eight months of age, but after the horns are starting to grow attached to the skull, so a cup dehorner or a Gigli saw, a type of surgical cutting wire, is used. There are several different types of cup dehorners, but they all serve the same function of removing the horn and growth ring. Since the horn is tougher it takes more force to remove it so tools that provide some leverage are need. Gigli saw wire is used on horns of older calf's horns that have grown too large for the cup dehorners. *The most recent development in dehorning technology is use of a caustic dehorning paste. The paste is used on calves at less than two days old. The hair around the horn is trimmed back and then the paste is spread all over the horn bud and around the base of the horn on the growth cells. The paste kills the growth ring of the horn and then the horn falls off like a scab when it is healed. However, this method bears a risk of the paste causing injury to the animal's eyes or other tissues if used during periods of rain. =Restraint methods= The animal to be dehorned is usually restrained, either using a dehorning table or with chemical restraint —sedation. This ensures that the dehorning procedure can be done safely and properly. Young calves are run through a head gate (similar to a cattle crush) or haltered. Calves more than a few months old are held in a head gate and their head restrained with a dehorning table or chin bar. Smaller animals like sheep and goats may be restrained by hand or with use of halters. =Pain control= In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) survey suggested that most cattle in the U.S. were disbudded or dehorned without the use of anesthesia at that time. The survey showed that more than nine out of ten dairy farms practiced dehorning, but fewer than 20 percent of cattle dairy operations used analgesics or anesthesia during the process. While animal rights groups, like the Humane Society of the United States, condemn the practice of dehorning, ending it would mean increased horn-related injuries to cattle and humans. Polled genetics, long a staple in beef cattle breeding are becoming more popular among dairy farmers, with more polled calves being born to dairy cattle every year. Genetic testing can now determine if cattle carry genes for growing horns.\\"USDA NAHMS Dairy 2007\\". USDA NAHMS Online. January 2010.

The original 1868 hotel closed in 2003; it was demolished in 2005 and a new facility opened in 2010 on the same site which retained much of the original structure's form and appearance, as well as the original name. Both the original and its reconstruction are noted for their rambling Victorian architecture and distinctive yellow siding. The original Ocean House was the last waterfront Victorian-era hotel on mainland Rhode Island. History The Ocean House was originally built in 1868. It was smaller than the other hotels located on Watch Hill, but it expanded with numerous additions over the years. The original Ocean House was a central structure in the Watch Hill Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In March, 2004, Girouard Associates of New Canaan, Connecticut purchased the facility from heirs of the Louis D. Miller family, which had owned the hotel since 1938. Girouard Associates intended to raze Ocean House and build five large oceanfront homes, but a protest ensued. A new buyer was ultimately found, and the spirit of the original building was preserved, although not the actual building. The motion picture American Aristocracy starring Douglas Fairbanks was filmed at the Ocean House in 1916. Closing, protest, and demolition Factors related to the closing of the original Ocean House included its lack of modern amenities, its dilapidated condition, and its non-compliance with current building codes. The original Ocean House operated seasonally, open roughly three months a year, and the building lacked a heating, air conditioning, and ventilation system. In the last years of its operation, the top two floors were unused and only 59 rooms were serviceable out of its original 159. The aging facility lacked requisite amenities, service functions, egress requirements, handicapped accessibility requirements, and parking to meet modern codes. A newspaper article described its final condition: \\"Grand staircases lead nowhere. Rainwater seeps through the walls and runs down wired-in-place gutters. The oak elevator is broken.\\" The 138 year-old building was non-compliant with current building and life safety codes. Its timber structure had been compromised by indiscriminate installation of electric, gas, and plumbing utilities, as well as a subsequent reconfiguration of rooms to include private bathrooms. Rhode Island's fire codes were revised and more rigorously enforced after the 2003 Station nightclub fire,https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/RI_finalreport_june2905.htm rendering the deficiencies insurmountable at Ocean House. Compliance with current life-safety standards, including those for hurricane and wind protection, required installation of interior structural shear walls, new hurricane-rated windows with new frames, a new concrete foundation with steel tie-downs throughout, stripping off all interior and exterior lead paint, and removal of interior mold requiring demolition of interior finishes. In 2004, the Ocean House was not permitted to open because of code deficiencies; the original hotel ceased operations in 2003 and was sold. The community learned in March 2004 that a developer from out of town planned to raze Ocean House and build five homes in its place, so organizers began a campaign to save the building and preserve the site's public oceanfront access and beach. These organizers included representatives from Preserve Rhode Island, Rhode Island Historical Preservation, and Heritage Commission, as well as the National Trust. Another buyer was found who deemed it economically and physically unfeasible to make the building functional and code compliant, but he promised to rebuild it from the ground up. The original building was demolished and a new facility constructed on site. Reconstruction Project architects met resistance with the demolition of Ocean House, but they successfully argued for reconstruction. They suggested a building modeled after the original Ocean House as it was at its zenith, around 1908. This would permit a 49-room hotel appropriate in scale to its adjacent streets, while expanding toward the beach where 23 condominiums could be accommodated. It also would enable it to have the amenities and service functions that could make the project functionally and economically feasible. The original Ocean House structure was demolished in December 2005 and the subsequent facility opened in 2010.http://www.oceanhouseri.com/press/new-englands-historic-ocean-house-to- re-open-its-doors The new design is 50,000 square feet larger than the original at 156,000 square feet. It reconstructs much of the original massing and restores certain original details that had been removed during the ongoing operation of the facility, such as the original mansard roof. It also incorporates new elements, including subterranean facilities and two new wings extending from the main building, which also shield neighboring residential areas from hotel activities. The original facility was documented and overall dimensions and heights were preserved, including the size and location of windows. Actual pieces of the original building were salvaged and the design replicates columns, capitals, and woodwork. Materials within human reach are wood, while detailing which is out of reach is made of synthetic materials that are more easy to maintain. The new facility features 49 guest rooms and 23 residential condominium suites,http://www.oceanhouseri.com/watch-hill-real- estate.php as well as meeting rooms, spa, lap pool, fitness center, and restaurant. The design also accommodates service functions requisite to a modern facility: up to date kitchens, loading docks, mechanical rooms, fire egress requirements (e.g., redundant stairs), and staff facilities.

It was the formal peace treaty that confirmed the preliminary agreement achieved with English mediation by the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, and officially ended the First Silesian War. Based on article 5 of the treaty, Austrian Silesia comprising the ducal lands of Neisse (yellow), Troppau (red) with Jägerndorf (blue), and Teschen (orange) Maria Theresa ceded most of Silesia with the County of Kladsko to Frederick, except for those districts of the Duchy of Troppau that were located south of the Opava river, including the southern part of the former Duchy of Jägerndorf, the possession of which had been one pretext for Frederick's invasion. The Duchy of Neisse held by the Breslau bishops was also partitioned, with the fortress-city of Nysa and the larger northern portion of the territory falling to Prussia. Austria retained the entire Upper Silesian Duchy of Teschen, ruled by Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The remaining Habsburg territories were incorporated into the crown land of Austrian Silesia. Prussia in turn left the anti-Habsburg coalition it had forged with France, Spain, Sweden, Naples and the Electorates of Bavaria, Saxony and Cologne. It also assumed debts of about 1.7 million gulden which Austria had contracted with her ally Great Britain. King George II of Great Britain acted as guarantor. With his territorial gain, Frederick enlarged the Prussian territory by one third, achieving the status of a European great power and initiating the hundred-year Austria–Prussia rivalry. However, Prussia's former ally King Louis XV of France was upset by this peace agreement that gave the united Austrian, British and Hanoverian forces a free hand to oust the French troops at the 1743 Battle of Dettingen - an alienation that ultimately led to the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756. Maria Theresa's Wittelsbach rival Emperor Charles VII, deserted and humiliated, had to stay at his Frankfurt exile while his Bavarian electorate remained under Austrian occupation. The peace reached was short-lived, as both sides prepared for the Second Silesian War, opened by Frederick marching against Prague in August 1744.

The station is the city's main train station as well its main long-distance bus terminal.  History  Passenger traffic started at Jyväskylä on , when the railway track from Haapamäki was built and Jyväskylä was added to the Finnish railway network. The track to Suolahti was opened in 1898, and later extended to Äänekoski and Haapajärvi. Another line was opened to Pieksämäki in 1918. The current track layout dates of 1977, when a new line was opened between Jämsänkoski and Jyväskylä to ease traffic between Haapajärvi and Jyväskylä. Passenger traffic started on the new line in May 1978. The station building was built between 1896 and 1897 according to the style of the time, by the architect Bruno Granholm at the Finnish Railway Institute. The station building represents national romanticist wooden architecture. The station included the stationmaster's quarters and a storage house. The station expanded with a restaurant designed by Thure Hellström in 1916. In addition, two two-floor residential buildings with accompanying service buildings were built in 1921. The station building was expanded again in 1923 and from 1968 to 1969. Visions of combining the rail and bus stations had already started during the 1980s, and a competition was held in 1995 to select the design for the future station. The winning bid, collaborately designed by architect companies Harris & Kjisik and Petri Rouhiainen, was named Kannel as it was modeled after the Finnish instrument. Work started in July 2011. The new travel centre was opened on near the old station buildings, which were converted into business, service and residential use. The old station is part of the Finnish contract to preserve historically significant station areas, and is part of the inventory of culturally significant areas of the Finnish National Board of Antiquities.  Services  On the first floor, the travel centre offers services for both bus and rail passengers . It also contains restaurants, small shops, a baby-care space and a passenger information system.

It was first broadcast on 9 June 2007 on BBC One. The episode was directed by Hettie MacDonald and is the only episode in the 2007 series written by Steven Moffat. The episode is based on a previous short story written by Moffat for the 2006 Doctor Who Annual, entitled \\"'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' By Sally Sparrow\\". In the episode, the Tenth Doctor—a time travelling alien played by David Tennant—is trapped in 1969 and tries to communicate with a young woman in 2007, Sally Sparrow (Carey Mulligan), to prevent the statue-like Weeping Angels from taking control of the TARDIS. Sparrow and her best friend's brother, Larry Nightingale (Finlay Robertson), must unravel a set of cryptic clues sent through time by the marooned Doctor, left in DVD Easter eggs. Both the Doctor and his companion Martha Jones, played by Freema Agyeman, have very little screen time in this episode, which allowed for another episode to be filmed simultaneously; \\"Blink\\" is consequently sometimes referred to by fans as a \\"Doctor-lite\\" episode. The scenes at Wester Drumlins were shot in a derelict house in Newport. To create the angels, two actresses wore makeup and prosthetics. The episode was seen by 6.62 million viewers in the United Kingdom. \\"Blink\\" received widespread critical acclaim, and is widely considered to be one of the best dramatic episodes of the show. Moffat won the BAFTA Craft and BAFTA Cymru awards for Best Writer, and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form; while for her single performance in the series, Mulligan won the Constellation Award for Best Female Performance in a 2007 Science Fiction Television Episode. In 2009 the episode was voted the second best Doctor Who story ever by readers of Doctor Who Magazine. Plot In 2007, Sally Sparrow, intrigued by a message written to her under peeling wallpaper about \\"the Weeping Angel\\", explores the abandoned house Wester Drumlins with her friend Kathy Nightingale. Kathy is sent back in time to 1920 by a Weeping Angel statue. At that moment, Kathy's grandson delivers to the house a message from 1987 about the long life Kathy led. Before leaving, Sally takes a Yale key hanging from the hand of a statue. Sally visits Kathy's brother Larry at work to tell him Kathy loves him. Larry explains that he has been documenting an \\"Easter egg\\" in seventeen different DVDs containing a video message of a man having half of a conversation with the viewer. Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs. Four Weeping Angel statues follow Sally to the police station, where they take an impounded fake police box and send DI Billy Shipton back to 1969. The man in the Easter egg, a time traveller called the Doctor, has also been sent to the past, and asks Billy to relay a message decades later. Billy puts the Easter egg on the DVDs. In 2007, a much older Billy phones Sally to visit him on his deathbed in the hospital. Before he dies, Billy instructs Sally to look at the list. The list is Sally's own DVD collection. Sally and Larry return to the house and play the Easter egg on a portable DVD player. Sally discovers she can converse with the Doctor in 1969, as he possesses a copy of the complete transcript that Larry is currently compiling. The Doctor explains that aliens called Weeping Angels turn to stone statues when any living creature observes them. He fears they are seeking the vast reserves of time energy in the police box, which is his time machine the TARDIS. A Weeping Angel pursues Sally and Larry to the basement where the TARDIS is. Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside. Larry inserts a now-glowing DVD, which also functions as a control disk, in the console's DVD player. The ship returns to the Doctor, while leaving Sally and Larry behind. The Weeping Angels standing around the TARDIS get tricked into looking at each other and are permanently frozen. A year later, Sally and Larry meet the Doctor prior to him being stuck in 1969. Sally hands the Doctor Larry's transcript, and warns that he will need it. Production =Writing= The episode was written by Steven Moffat. \\"Blink\\" was written by Steven Moffat. Part of the story for \\"Blink\\" is based on Moffat's Ninth Doctor short story from the Doctor Who Annual 2006 called \\"'What I Did on My Christmas Holidays' by Sally Sparrow\\". The short story is presented as a homework essay from Sally, though only 12 years old, who encounters evidence of the Doctor's presence from the past in her aunt's house while visiting. \\"What I Did\\" includes several elements that are reused in \\"Blink\\", including messages under the wallpaper and an ontological paradox involving a conversation between Sally and the Doctor, prerecorded on a video cassette, based on a written transcript—the essay itself; however, instead of the Weeping Angels, \\"What I Did\\" features the Doctor and the TARDIS inadvertently separated twenty years in time by a fault in the time machine, and the Doctor is able to instruct Sally how to bring it back to him in the past. Moffat had held the idea of the Weeping Angels since seeing an angel statue in a graveyard whilst on a family holiday, and had planned to use them for the next series in the episodes that became \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\". However, after withdrawing from the writing of series three's first two-part story—Helen Raynor took over these episodes, writing \\"Daleks in Manhattan\\" and \\"Evolution of the Daleks\\"—Moffat volunteered to write the series' Doctor-lite episode and opted to use the Weeping Angels in what would become \\"Blink\\". Moffat was also inspired to write the episode based on the popular children's game Statues,Burk and Smith, p. 166 which he always found \\"frightening\\". Murray Gold, the composer for the series, later compared the creatures to the moving ghostly topiary animals in Stephen King's 1977 horror novel The Shining. \\"Blink\\" is the third story of the revived series to be adapted for television by the same writer from a piece of their spin-off writing. It follows the \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Family of Blood\\" story arc, which was adapted by Paul Cornell from his 1995 novel Human Nature; and \\"Dalek\\", which used the basic premise as well as several scenes and lines of dialogue adapted by Robert Shearman from his 2003 audio drama Jubilee. \\"Blink\\" is referred to as a \\"Doctor-Lite\\" episode because the Doctor and his companion have very little screen time. This allowed two episodes to be filmed simultaneously, a process known as \\"double banking\\". The practice began with the 2006 entry \\"Love & Monsters\\", and continued for episodes such as \\"Turn Left\\", \\"Midnight\\", and \\"The Girl Who Waited\\". Moffat stated that he felt relaxed when he was writing the script for \\"Blink\\", for if it proved to be unpopular, he could blame the \\"Doctor-lite\\" structure of the episode. Due to the show's tight schedule, \\"Blink\\" had only one script meeting. =Filming= Actress Carey Mulligan (seen here in 2009) appeared in the episode as Sally Sparrow. \\"Blink\\" was directed by Hettie MacDonald, making her the first female director of a Doctor Who episode since the Sixth Doctor serial The Mark of the Rani. Russell T Davies, the series' executive producer, later noted that, due to MacDonald's work, the episode included some of \\"the most beautiful [visuals] we've ever had\\". British actress Carey Mulligan was chosen to play Sally Sparrow; Mulligan was reportedly ecstatic to have been cast in the series. She was initially concerned with the fact that Tennant would have little screen time, but after the episode aired was very pleased with the final result. Location shooting for scenes set at the Police Station Garage took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay on 21 November 2006. Fields House, located in Newport, filled in for Wester Drumlins. The house was already abandoned and falling into disrepair when the filming crews arrived. Moffat noted that \\"very little of it was tarted up\\" for the shoot; Moffat later called the location \\"the creepiest house\\" he had ever seen. The name was taken from a previous residence that Moffat lived in during the late 1990s. Larry describes the residence as \\"Scooby-Doo's house\\", a reference to the dilapidated mansions that the Scooby-Doo gang would usually visit.Russell, p. 187 The BBC Fact File for the episode notes that 1969—the year Martha, the Doctor and Billy are sent to—is the first year Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! aired. Originally, the producers considered having Michael Obiora play both the young and old version of Billy Shipton. However, it was decided that Obiora in makeup would look too fake, and so Louis Mahoney was cast to play the older version. Initially, Obiora played the role with a London accent; Mahoney, however, has a Gambian accent, and so Obiora had to re-dub his lines to match. Billy mentions that the windows of the TARDIS are the wrong size for a real police box. In 2004, when the first photographs of the new series' TARDIS prop were revealed, there was a vigorous discussion of the box's dimensions on the Outpost Gallifrey Doctor Who discussion forum, in which some fans complained that the prop's windows were too big. Moffat has confirmed that this line is an in-joke aimed at the Outpost Gallifrey forum. =Effects= Moffat joked that \\"since I was a kid, I've been thinking of Doctor Who monsters, just now when I do, it costs the art department […] a lot of money\\". To create the rigid structure of the angels' dresses, prosthetics supervisors Rob Mayor soaked fabric in fibreglass resin, which was then painted over. Although they are never shown moving on screen, all of the Weeping Angels were played by actresses Aga Blonska and Elen Thomas wearing makeup and prosthetics.Russell, p. 186 The actresses wore two distinct masks: one that was more docile looking, and one with fangs bared. Blonska later noted that \\"I'm partly painted, partly glued into the costume, but it's quite comfortable.\\" Although the actresses were slightly \\"wobbly\\" when they stood still, the producers used digital effects to, in essence, freeze the angels on film. Moffat was very pleased with the results, and called them \\"fantastic\\". Mulligan later called the effects \\"so good\\" and \\"really creepy\\". To create the effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves around the ship's set. The camera's operator then shook the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves. The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more convincing. Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that he can hear her in the DVD shop, because he knew the lines that appeared would have to play \\"double duty later on\\" and be authentic and fresh both times. Gold called the sequences \\"the heart of the Chinese puzzle\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Blink\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 9 June 2007. Overnight ratings showed that it was watched by 6.1 million viewers, which rose to 6.62 once time-shifted viewers were taken into account. The episode was the seventh most watched episode on BBC One for the week ending 10 June and was the lowest- rated episode of Doctor Who third series. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 04–10, 2007\\", listed under BBC1 It received an Appreciation Index of 87, considered \\"excellent\\". In its initial broadcast, a short clip of a card reading \\"One Year Later\\" was shown before the episode's denouement. In the syndicated and the DVD version, this shot has been removed.Burk and Smith, p. 167 A Region 2 DVD containing \\"Blink\\" together with the episodes \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Family of Blood\\" was released on 23 July 2007. It was re- released as part of the complete series three DVD on 5 November 2007. =Critical reception and accolades= The wall with the Doctor's writing, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. \\"Blink\\" received universal critical acclaim, with many praising the acting, the script, the level of fear and the Weeping Angels themselves. The Guardian Stephen Brook called it a \\"wonderfully creepy episode\\" that \\"ultimately made sense\\" despite \\"barely featur[ing] the Doctor and Martha\\". David Bradley of SFX awarded \\"Blink\\" five out of five stars, saying that it could have featured any of the previous Doctors and predicted that its \\"timelessness\\" would ensure that it would \\"[go] down as one of the finest, scariest, cleverest Who episodes ever\\". IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, praising the way the audience felt they had known Sally Sparrow for a while, as well as the strength of Mulligan's performance, although he noted that \\"all of the performances in this episode are exceptional\\". He concluded that, \\"it's difficult to believe that so much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them\\". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode was not just the best Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the \\"tenderness of the story and the characters\\" which were \\"quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes\\". The Daily Telegraph named the episode one of the best of the show's entire run, noting that, while the Doctor \\"is somewhat on the periphery here\\", it \\"adds to the threat\\". Many critics consider the episode one of the strongest during Tennant's time as the Doctor. IGN's Matt Wales named it the sixth best episode of Tennant's tenure, while Sam McPherson of TVOvermind listed it as the second best Tenth Doctor episode. In 2011, before the second half of the sixth series, The Huffington Post labelled \\"Blink\\" as one of the five essential episodes for new viewers to watch. The Weeping Angels also received critical praise. In 2009 SFX named the climax with the Weeping Angels advancing on Sally and Larry the scariest moment in Doctor Who history, describing it as \\"a terrifying combination of scary concept and perfect direction\\". The Weeping Angels came in at number three in Neil Gaiman's \\"Top Ten New Classic Monsters\\" in Entertainment Weekly, while TV Squad named them the third scariest television characters. They were also rated the third \\"baddie\\" in Doctor Who by The Daily Telegraph, behind the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks. In 2009 SFX listed the Angels in their list of favourite things of the revival of Doctor Who, writing, \\"Scariest. Monsters. Ever.\\" Writer Steven Moffat was awarded the 2008 BAFTA Craft and BAFTA Cymru awards for Best Writer for his work on this episode. \\"Blink\\" won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, and Carey Mulligan received the Constellation Award for Best Female Performance in a 2007 Science Fiction Television Episode. The episode was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Script, but lost to Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro. =Legacy= \\"Blink\\" received the award for Best Story in the Doctor Who Magazine 2007 Survey. In Doctor Who Magazine 2009 poll to find the greatest Doctor Who story ever, it came in second place after Peter Davison's final story, The Caves of Androzani. In a 2007 poll conducted by the BBC, taking votes from 2,000 readers of the Doctor Who Adventures magazine, the Weeping Angels were voted the scariest monsters of 2007 with 55% of the vote; the Master and the Daleks took second and third place with 15% and 4% of the vote. In a 2012 poll of over ten thousand respondents conducted by the Radio Times, the Weeping Angels were again voted the best Doctor Who monster with 49.4% of the vote. In Doctor Who Magazine 2014 fan poll of the greatest episodes of all time, \\"Blink\\" again came in second, this time behind the 2013 episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". Moffat, after becoming lead writer of the programme, wrote \\"The Time of Angels\\" and \\"Flesh and Stone\\" for the fifth series as a more action-oriented sequel that brought back the Weeping Angels, believing that good monsters should come back with a different style of story. They also returned in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" from the show's seventh series , featured in the mini- episode, \\"Good as Gold\\", written by children for a Blue Peter contest and have made cameo appearances in the episodes \\"The God Complex\\", \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", \\"Hell Bent\\" and in the finale to the first series of the Doctor Who spin-off, Class. They are also featured in the New Series Adventures novel Touched by an Angel by Jonathan Morris. A line spoken by the Doctor, \\"The angels have the phone box\\", is rhetorically repeated by Larry and prompts him to say \\"I've got that on a T-shirt\\". As expected by Moffat and Gold, this led online retailers such as ThinkGeek, and Zazzle, among others, to offer versions of such a product for sale. In addition, the \\"wibbly-wobbly timey- wimey\\" line has been used to describe several of Moffat's complex time travel stories, such as \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\". The line was also referenced in the first episode of the fifth series, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", when the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) scans the crack in young Amelia Pond's (Caitlin Blackwood) wall with his sonic screwdriver.Burk and Smith, p. 227 BBC America created a series of four specials prior to the seventh series premiere of Doctor Who, including one entitled \\"The Timey-Wimey Stuff of Doctor Who\\". British \\"Timelord rock\\" band Chameleon Circuit, composed of YouTube bloggers Alex Day and Charlie McDonnell among others, wrote a song about the episode, also entitled \\"Blink\\", and released it on their debut eponymous album.

Woman of the Apocalypse Diego Velázquez's Immaculate Conception 1618. The New Testament's Book of Revelation (12:1, 2 & 5) describes the Woman of the Apocalypse: And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. And she being with child cried, travailing in birth. .... And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. In Catholic tradition she has been identified with the Blessed Virgin Mary, especially in connection with the Immaculate Conception. Mary is often pictured with a crown or Circle of Stars. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was somewhat controversial in the medieval church, and the liturgical Office for the feast was only established in 1615. In 1649, Francisco Pacheco (father-in-law of Velázquez) published his Art of Painting firmly establishing the detailed correct iconography for paintings of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, which included the circle of stars (he also advised the inquisition in Seville on artistic matters). This was followed by Murillo and his school in very many paintings, and influenced non- Spanish depictions. European Flag The European flag, first adopted by the Council of Europe, consists of 12 golden stars in a circle on a blue background. The stars symbolise the ideals of unity, solidarity and harmony among the peoples of Europe. The number of stars has nothing to do with the number of member countries, though the circle is a symbol of unity. Arsène Heitz, one of the flag designers, in 1987 revealed that his inspiration was the crown of twelve stars of the Woman of the Apocalypse, often found in modern Marian iconography. However, he did not suggest that the finished design held a religious meaning. Paul M. G. Lévy, the official responsible for the design process, denied any religious inspiration for the flag design. Carlo Curti Gialdino, I Simboli dell'Unione europea, Bandiera - Inno - Motto - Moneta - Giornata. Roma: Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato S.p.A., 2005. , pp. 80-85. Gialdino is here cited after a translation of the Italian text published by the Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe (cvce.eu) \\"While Count Coudenhove-Kalergi in a personal statement maintained that three leading Catholics within the Council had subconsciously chosen the twelve stars on the model of Apocalypse 12:1, Paul M.G. Lévy, Press Officer of the Council from 1949 to 1966, explained in 1989 that there was no religious intention whatsoever associated with the choice of the circle of twelve stars.\\" Peter Diem, 11 June 2002 Zodiac 6th century synagogue Zodiac, Beit Alpha, Israel The Zodiac is an ancient circle of starsJeffrey Armstrong  A Western Master of Eastern Wisdom where some stars are symbolically combined into 12 star signs also known as constellations. The etymology of the term Zodiac comes from the Latin zōdiacus, from the Greek ζῳδιακός [κύκλος], meaning \\"[circle] of animals\\", derived from ζῴδιον, the diminutive of ζῷον \\"animal\\". Crown of Immortality The Crown of Immortality is a separate and earlier motif (and metaphor) which also uses a circle of stars. It has been widely used since the Early Church as a metaphor for the reward awaiting martyrs, but they are not depicted in art wearing a circle of stars. In art the use is mainly in Baroque allegorical compositions, and those with Ariadne.

It was broadcast on BBC One on 23 June 2007. It is the second of three episodes that form a linked narrative, following \\"Utopia\\" and followed by \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". In the episode, set in the 21st century, the alien time traveller the Master (John Simm) uses a network of mobile phone satellites to hypnotise the world and influence the population of the United Kingdom into electing him Prime Minister. Following the election, he makes contact with an invading race he calls the Toclafane. Plot The Tenth Doctor, Jack, and Martha escape the Futurekind by using Jack's vortex manipulator to return to present-day London. They quickly learn that the Master has taken on the persona of Harold Saxon, and is the newly elected Prime Minister. The Master has created a phone network called Archangel which subliminally influences the population to vote for him. The three narrowly avoid a bomb placed in Martha's flat and learn that Martha's family has been arrested. The Master contacts them to gloat about his seeming victory, and reveals that the three are wanted criminals. Hiding in an abandoned building, the Doctor uses parts of Martha's laptop and his TARDIS keys to create perception filters so they can move about unnoticed. He explains some of the Master's past and tells them how, as a child, the Master looked into the time vortex and was driven mad. They see a TV report that the Master is planning to reveal humanity's first contact the next day with an alien race known as the Toclafane. UNIT takes over the meeting and moves it to the flying aircraft carrier Valiant. The Master accepts the changes and boards the Valiant with his wife Lucy. The Doctor, Martha, and Jack teleport aboard and discover that the TARDIS has been converted by the Master into a Paradox Machine that is building up power to be activated at the appointed time of first contact. The Doctor, Martha, and Jack enter the bridge of the Valiant as the first four Toclafane appear on board. The Master orders the Toclafane to kill US President Winters. The Master reveals that he can see around the perception filters, and uses his laser screwdriver to kill Jack and artificially age the Doctor 100 years using Professor Lazarus's genetic manipulation technology and DNA he took from the Doctor's severed hand (which Jack took aboard the TARDIS). Jack, having been revived, gives Martha his vortex manipulator and tells Martha to get off the Valiant. The Master brings Martha's family onto the bridge as the Paradox Machine activates. A massive rift opens above the Valiant, allowing six billion Toclafane to descend upon Earth and kill one-tenth of the Earth's population. Martha tends to the aged Doctor, and he whispers into her ear. She uses the vortex manipulator to teleport away, and promises to come back. =Continuity= The first televised black Time Lord appears during this Gallifrey flashback. Black Time Lords previously appeared in the spin-off novel The Shadows of Avalon by Paul Cornell, published in 2000, as well as in the Big Finish Productions audio plays, in which Lord President Rassilon was played by actor Don Warrington whose likeness is used for the character in official artwork. Whilst the boy Master wears a black-and-white outfit like those worn by the first Time Lords seen on screen, in The War Games in 1969, the adult Time Lords are depicted dressed in the ceremonial robes first seen in The Deadly Assassin in 1976. Created by then BBC staff designer James Acheson prior to his film career, the huge stiff collars of these outfits remained the distinctive look for officials of the Doctor's race. The collars used were the originals, on loan from the Doctor Who Exhibition in Blackpool.Doctor Who Magazine Issue #384, page 15 The Seal of Rassilon—the equally well-established Gallifreyan symbol employed by Acheson (originally in the non-Time Lord-related Revenge of the Cybermen)—appears here for the first time since its prominent use in the television movie. When talking to the world's press cameras toward the end of the episode, the Master begins his speech \\"Peoples of the Earth, please attend carefully.\\" This paraphrases part of a speech he gave in episode four of Logopolis (1981), which began \\"Peoples of the Universe, please attend carefully.\\" The Master refers to his wife, Lucy Saxon, as his faithful \\"companion\\", a title regularly assumed by the travelling partners of the Doctor. The Master is shown enjoying an episode of Teletubbies, continuing a fascination with children's television first seen in The Sea Devils (1972), when he was shown watching Clangers. He wryly analyses both series' characters, remarking how amazing it would be if they were real.BBC Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide When confronting Lucy about her husband's fictitious life history, Vivien Rook refers to the fall of Harriet Jones, who first appeared as an MP in \\"Aliens of London\\" before being elected Prime Minister by the time of \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". Although that episode hinted at her downfall due to the Doctor's intervention (due to her having a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons), this episode confirms it, mentioned as being at the same point that the Master appeared. In his first cabinet session, the Master refers to the reconstruction of the Cabinet Rooms and Downing Street, which were destroyed at the climax of \\"World War Three\\". Martha's television is branded Magpie Electricals—this company originally rented and sold televisions manufactured by other companies in the 1950s, as seen in \\"The Idiot's Lantern\\". The Master reveals that he was responsible for Tish getting the job working for Professor Lazarus—whose work he was funding—in \\"The Lazarus Experiment\\", hoping to trap the Doctor and Martha. In that episode a circular symbol can be seen throughout the main building featured, the same symbol is visible as being part of the Master's ring in this episode, a hint that he is connected to the Lazarus project. He has since incorporated the genetic manipulation technology into his new laser screwdriver. The Doctor has previously been prematurely aged in The Leisure Hive (1980). This is the first episode in which it is explicitly established that the TARDIS' anachronistic nature goes largely unnoticed in part due to its \\"perception filter\\". This was previously hinted by Torchwood episode \\"Everything Changes\\", where it was explained that this property of the TARDIS had been welded to a pavement slab. The second use of the term was in \\"Human Nature\\" where the Doctor noted that his TARDIS could place one on his fob watch. US President Winters states that UNIT protocols for alien first contact were established in 1968; this was the year UNIT was introduced to the series in The Invasion. Winters, the President of the United States, refers to himself as \\"President-elect\\". The Doctor makes reference to having to end the Time War. This is echoed in \\"The Satan Pit\\" when the Beast calls the Doctor the \\"killer of his own kind\\", suggesting explicitly the Doctor's involvement with the destruction of all the Time Lords in the last great Time War. This is also alluded to in \\"Journey's End\\" to a lesser extent, and \\"The End of Time\\". In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" it's later revealed that the Tenth Doctor had a hand in it as well as his past War Doctor incarnation and his future eleventh incarnation, but that things didn't end as he had previously believed. The Master, as Saxon, offers Lucy Saxon a Jelly Baby whilst inside the Valiant. These were a favourite sweet of the Fourth Doctor and the Master offers them to his wife in a similar way. \\"Vote Saxon\\" posters would also appear at various points throughout Series 3 and at least once in the Torchwood episode \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\". =Outside references= Writing in the episode's BBC Fact File, Peter Ware observes that the Master's introduction of the Jones family as having come \\"all the way from prison\\" is similar to the style used in the TV show This Is Your Life. When the Master addresses the nation, he opens with 'Britain, Britain, Britain'. This is a reference to the popular British comedy Little Britain, which opened with Tom Baker's narrator saying the same. Tom Baker also played The Fourth Doctor. Production and publicity Vote Saxon poster as seen in the episode. This episode, along with \\"Utopia\\" and \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", are treated in several sources as a three-part story, the first such story in the revived series of Doctor Who. However, Russell T Davies has said that he regards \\"Utopia\\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary. Some of the car action sequences in this episode were filmed by Freema Agyeman herself rather than a stunt double, and took place at Harbour View Road, Penarth. David Tennant's makeup in which he is aged 100 years was inspired by the First Doctor, William Hartnell. The episode was advertised on BBC television with a spoof party political broadcast, featuring testimonials from British celebrities Sharon Osbourne, McFly and Ann Widdecombe showing their support for Mr Saxon, a version of which is seen in the episode itself. Also during the broadcast, drums can be heard. There is also a different trailer that showed still shots of the Doctor, Martha Jones and Captain Jack over the top of which Mr Saxon's speech, in which he says, \\"what this country really needs, right now, is a doctor\\", can be heard and at the end there is a small clip of him showing his trademark smile, who has intent to kill the Doctor public. The celebrity appearances in the episode itself differ from those in the trailer, most noticeably that of Ann Widdecombe, who appears alone in the trailer but alongside Mr Saxon in the episode. The BBC had created two fictional websites in connection with these episodes, www.votesaxon.co.uk and /www.haroldsaxon.co.uk/. The latter site, at one time, did replicate the video and web pages seen by the characters in \\"The Sound of Drums\\". =Cast notes= Lachele Carl previously appeared as the American news anchor in \\"Aliens of London\\", \\"World War Three\\", and \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". The spin-off website \\"Who is Doctor Who?\\" states her name as \\"Mal Loup\\". This is mangled French for \\"Bad Wolf\\". This newscaster's name has subsequently been specified in the end credits as \\"Trinity Wells\\". Zoe Thorne previously voiced the Gelth in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\".* Olivia Hill played a TV Reporter in The Sarah Jane Adventures episode \\"Invasion of the Bane\\" (2007). William Hughes, who plays the young Master, played the even younger Casanova in the eponymous BBC serial written by Russell T. Davies, in which David Tennant plays the adult Casanova. =Music= The drumming motif used several times in the story bears similarities to the underbeat of the Doctor Who theme tune. \\"Voodoo Child\\" by Rogue Traders is played diegetically within this episode. The song, from the album Here Come the Drums, has the phrases \\"the sound of drums\\" and \\"here come the drums\\" in its lyrics.

Background Frederick II had taken advantage of Maria Theresa's difficulties to prevail as Queen of Bohemia according to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and in 1740 occupied Silesia, part of the Habsburg Monarchy since 1526. Several attempts to expel the invaders failed, while troops of Frederick's allies France, Saxony and Bavaria even campaigned in the adjacent Bohemian lands. East Frisia in 1744, Royal Prussia with Netze District during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Mansfeld in 1780 Secret peace negotiations had been carried on since fall 1741, yet still Frederick invaded Bohemia and defeated the Austrian troops at the Battle of Chotusitz on 17 May 1742. By the agency of John Carmichael, 3rd Earl of Hyndford (mocked as Hundsfott, \\"scoundrel\\" by Frederick), envoy of the British, which was eager to prevent further war in Europe, a peace was concluded. Content Based on the terms of the treaty, Maria Theresa ceded most of the Silesian duchies to Prussia except for the Duchy of Teschen, the districts of Troppau and Krnov south of the Opava river as well as the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa, that were all to become the province of Austrian Silesia. Furthermore, Frederick annexed the Bohemian County of Kladsko. Despite the popular name of the treaty, it was actually signed in Berlin.Lodge p. 4 This treaty, along with the Treaty of Berlin signed on 28 July 1742, officially ended the First Silesian War. Except for the partition of Cieszyn Silesia and the incorporation of the Hlučín Region in 1920, the 1742 demarcation line today still determines the border of the Czech Republic with Poland.

It has a specific role in lipid metabolism. The text in a 2014 report suggested that APOA1 mRNA is regulated by endogenously expressed antisense RNA. Structure The APOA1 gene is located on the 11th chromosome, with its specific location being 11q23-q24. The gene contains 4 exons. APOA1 encodes a 45.4 kDa protein that is composed of 396 amino acids; 21 peptides have been observed through mass spectrometry data. Function Apolipoprotein A1 is the major protein component of HDL particles in plasma. Chylomicrons secreted from the intestinal enterocyte also contain apo A1, but it is quickly transferred to HDL in the bloodstream. The protein, as a component of HDL particles, enables efflux of fat molecules by accepting fats from within cells (including macrophages within the walls of arteries which have become overloaded with ingested fats from oxidized LDL particles) for transport (in the water outside cells) elsewhere, including back to LDL particles or to the liver for excretion. It is a cofactor for lecithin cholesterolacyltransferase (LCAT) which is responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesteryl esters. Apo A1 was also isolated as a prostacyclin (PGI2) stabilizing factor, and thus may have an anticlotting effect. Defects in the gene encoding it are associated with HDL deficiencies, including Tangier disease, and with systemic non- neuropathic amyloidosis. ApoA1 is often used as a biomarker for prediction of cardiovascular diseases. The ratio apoB-100/apoA1 (i.e. LDL & larger particles vs. HDL particles), NMR measured lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) particle ratios even more so, has always had a stronger correlation with myocardial infarction event rates than older methods of measuring lipid transport in the water outside cells. ApoA1 is routinely measured using immunoassays such as ELISA or nephelometry.  Applications  ApoA1 can be used to create in vitro lipoprotein nanodiscs for cell-free membrane expression systems. Clinical significance = Activity associated with high HDL-C and protection from heart disease = As a major component of the high-density lipoprotein complex (protective \\"fat removal\\" particles), apo A1 helps to clear fats, including cholesterol, from white blood cells within artery walls, making the WBCs less likely to become fat overloaded, transform into foam cells, die and contribute to progressive atheroma. Five of nine men found to carry a mutation (E164X) who were at least 35 years of age had developed premature coronary artery disease. One of four mutants of apo A1 is present in roughly 0.3% of the Japanese population, but is found in 6% of those with low HDL cholesterol levels. ApoA-1 Milano is a naturally occurring mutant of apo A1, found in a few families in Limone sul Garda, Italy, and, by genetic + church record family tree detective work, traced to a single individual, Giovanni Pomarelli, in the 18th century.http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/11/16/the-long- saga-of-apo-a1-milano Described in 1980, it was the first known molecular abnormality of apolipoproteins. Paradoxically, carriers of this mutation have very low HDL-C (HDL-Cholesterol) levels, but no increase in the risk of heart disease, often living to age 100 or older. This unusual observation was what lead Italian investigators to track down what was going on and lead to the discovery of apo A1 Milano (the city, Milano, ~160 km away, in which the researcher's lab was located). Biochemically, apo A1 contains an extra cysteine bridge, causing it to exist as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with apo A-II. However, the enhanced cardioprotective activity of this mutant (which likely depends on fat & cholesterol efflux) cannot easily be replicated by other cysteine mutants. Recombinant apo A1 Milano dimers formulated into liposomes can reduce atheromas in animal models by up to 30%. Apo A1 Milano has also been shown in small clinical trials to have a statistically significant effect in reducing (reversing) plaque build-up on arterial walls. In human trials the reversal of plaque build-up was measured over the course of five weeks. =Novel haplotypes within apolipoprotein AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster= Lately, two novel susceptibility haplotypes i.e. P2-S2-X1 and P1-S2-X1 have been discovered in ApoAI-CIII-AIV gene cluster on chromosome 11q23, which confer approximately threefold higher risk of coronary heart disease in normal as well as in the patients having non-insulin diabetes mellitus. = Role in other diseases = A G/A polymorphism in the promoter of the apo A1 gene has been associated with the age at which patients presented with Alzheimer disease. Protection from Alzheimer's disease by apo A1 may rely on a synergistic interaction with alpha-tocopherol. Amyloid deposited in the knee following surgery consists largely of apo A1 secreted from chondrocytes (cartilage cells). A wide variety of amyloidosis symptoms are associated with rare Apo A1 mutants. Apo A-I binds to lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin, and has a major role in the anti-endotoxin function of HDL. In one study, a decrease in apo A1 levels was detected in schizophrenia patients' CSF, brain and peripheral tissues. = Epistatic impact of apo A1 = Apolipoprotein A1 and APOE interact epistatically to modulate triglyceride levels in coronary heart disease patients. Individually, neither apo A1 nor apo E was found to be associated with triglyceride (TG) levels, but pairwise epistasis (additive x additive model) explored their significant synergistic contributions with raised TG levels (P<0.01). = Factors affecting apo A1 activity = Apo A1 production is decreased by calcitriol, and increased by a drug that antagonizes it. Exercise or statin treatment may cause an increase in HDL-C levels by inducing apo A1 production, but this depends on the G/A promoter polymorphism.  Interactions  Apolipoprotein A1 has been shown to interact with: * ABCA1 * GPLD1 * PLTP =Potential binding partners= Apolipoprotein A1 binding precursor, a relative of APOA-1 abbreviated APOA1BP, has a predicted biochemical interaction with Carbohydrate Kinase Domain Containing Protein. The relationship between these two proteins is substantiated by cooccurance across genomes and coexpression. The ortholog of CARKD in E. coli contains a domain not present in any eukaryotic ortholog. This domain has a high sequence identity to APOA1BP. CARKD is a protein of unknown function, and the biochemical basis for this interaction is unknown. =Interactive pathway map=  See also  * Apolipoprotein B * Cardiovascular disease * ApoA-1 Milano  References   External links  Applied Research on Apolipoprotein-A1  Apolipoproteins zh:载脂蛋白 ","title":"Apolipoprotein A1"},{"id":"9755483","text":"Apolipoprotein A-II is an apolipoprotein found in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in plasma.

Riders travel in trains through a series of crypts, shooting laser guns at targets for high scores. History Scenic features in the queue line for Tomb Blaster, originally from Terror Tomb. Tomb Blaster is a dark ride in the Forbidden Kingdom area of Chessington World of Adventures Resort. It originally opened as The 5th Dimension, a dark ride based on a story of a TV repair robot that operated from 1987 to 1993. The ride system was manufactured by Mack Rides. The area was rethemed as the Forbidden Kingdom in 1994, and the ride became Terror Tomb, a horror ride in the dark. Terror Tomb (aka \\"Forbidden Tomb\\") told the story of a tomb robber named Abdab and the dangers he encountered trying to steal a gem from the tomb. It opened in 1994 and closed in 2001. In 2002 Tomb Blaster launched as a retheme of the old terror tomb ride utilising many of the sets but with some anamatronics being replaced. In the dark ride riders shoot laser guns at targets. In August 2015, Tomb Blaster closed for undisclosed reasons. It then underwent a minor refurbishment during the closed season, with a new laser gun system, an ultraviolet scenic treatment and altered audio. The refurbished ride debuted during the annual pass preview weekend of 2016 to a negative response.http://www.chessingtonbuzz.co.uk/news/tomb-blaster-back-from-the- dead/ General response from guests as well as fans of the ride criticised the \\"unprofessional\\" nature of the new lighting and audio alterations, citing missing sound effects, many animations still broken, missing pieces of the sets and excessive light spillage that revealed the areas intended to be covered by darkness.maniahub.com In 2020, the attraction was revamped with a new story overlay, new soundtrack and lighting, with some of the targets removed. The new story for the attraction is that guests are being recruited to rid the tomb of the curse of the high priest. Description Anyone under 1.1 meters must be accompanied by an adult. Riders sit in \\"utility vehicles\\" and travel through a tomb, shooting mummies and monsters with laser guns, and competing for top scores. Among the scenes are a crypt, a revolving tunnel, and snake pits. Many of the original set pieces from Terror Tomb remain in the Tomb Blaster ride with the exclusion of the Abdab animatronics. Incidents * On 7 June 2012, a four-year-old girl entered a near month-long coma after falling 14ft from the ride's raised queue line. The queue line's protective wooden fence panelling was both untreated and positioned in an area which was subject to rainwater runoff from a nearby roof. It had over the years become rotten due to weathering. Palings had previously fallen from the fence and had been nailed back into place despite their rotten nature. No formal records of the repairs were kept. A paling from the fence had fallen out on the day of the incident leaving a gap through which the girl fell. Severe injuries occurred, including broken ribs, a cracked skull, and bleeding on the brain. Chessington World of Adventures was fined £150,000 after pleading guilty to breaching the Health and Safety Act (1974).

Apo-CIII is secreted by the liver as well as the small intestine, and is found on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and remnant cholesterol.,  Structure  ApoCIII is a relatively small protein containing 79 amino acids that can be glycosylated at threonine-74. The most abundant glycoforms are characterized by an O-linked disaccharide galactose linked to N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal- GalNAc), further modified with up to 2 sialic acid residues. Less abundant glycoforms are characterized by more complex and fucosylated glycan moieties.  Function  APOC3 inhibits lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase; it is thought to inhibit hepatic uptake of triglyceride- rich particles. The APOA1, APOC3 and APOA4 genes are closely linked in both rat and human genomes. The A-I and A-IV genes are transcribed from the same strand, while the A-1 and C-III genes are convergently transcribed. An increase in apoC-III levels induces the development of hypertriglyceridemia. Recent evidences suggest an intracellular role for Apo-CIII in promoting the assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDL particles from hepatic cells under lipid-rich conditions. However, two naturally occurring point mutations in human apoC3 coding sequence, namely Ala23Thr and Lys58Glu have been shown to abolish the intracellular assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDL particles from hepatic cells.  Clinical significance  Overexpression of Apo-CIII in humans contributes to atherosclerosis. Two novel susceptibility haplotypes (specifically, P2-S2-X1 and P1-S2-X1) have been discovered in ApoAI-CIII-AIV gene cluster on chromosome 11q23; these confer approximately threefold higher risk of coronary heart disease in normal as well as non- insulin diabetes mellitus. In persons with type 2 diabetes, elevated plasma Apo-CIII is associated with higher plasma triglycerides and greater coronary artery calcification (a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis). Apo-CIII delays the catabolism of triglyceride rich particles. HDL cholesterol particles that bear Apo-CIII are associated with increased, rather than decreased, risk for coronary heart disease. Elevations of Apo-CIII found in genetic variation studies may predispose patients to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interactive pathway map Apolipoprotein CIII and HDL Apolipoprotein CIII is also found on HDL particles. Formation of APOCIII- containing HDL is not a matter of simple binding of APOCII to pre-existing HDL particles but requires the lipid transported ABCA1 in a fashion similar to APOA1-containing HDL. Accumulation of APOCIII on HDL is important for the maintenance of plasma triglyceride homeostasis since it prevents excessive amount of APOCIII on VLDL and other triglyceride rich lipoproteins, thus preventing APOCIII-mediated inhibition of LpL and the subsequent hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides. This may explain the hypertriglyceridemia associated with ABCA1-deficiency in patients with Tangier's disease.

Unlike other lipoproteins, which are mainly produced in the liver, apolipoprotein D is mainly produced in the brain and testes. It is a 29 kDa glycoprotein discovered in 1963 as a component of the High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) fraction of human plasma. It is the major component of human mammary cyst fluid. The human gene encoding it was cloned in 1986 and the deduced protein sequence revealed that ApoD is a member of the lipocalin family, small hydrophobic molecule transporters (Drayna et al, 1986). ApoD is 169 amino acids long, including a secretion peptide signal of 20 amino acids. It contains two glycosylation sites (aspargines 45 and 78) and the molecular weight of the mature protein varies from 20 to 32 kDa (see figure 1).Rassart Figure 1 The resolved tertiary structure shows that ApoD is composed of 8 anti-parallel β-strands forming a hydrophobic cavity capable of receiving different ligands. ApoD also contains 5 cysteine residues, 4 of which are involved in intra-molecular disulfide bonds.

It is a glycoprotein of estimated molecular weight 33 KDa. Apo-D is closely associated with the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase - an enzyme involved in lipoprotein metabolism. ApoD has also been shown to be an important link in the transient interaction between HDL and LDL particles and between HDL particles and cells. = Interactions and ligands = ApoD was shown to bind steroid hormones such as progesterone and pregnenolone with a relatively strong affinity, and to oestrogen with a weaker affinity. Molecular modeling studies identified bilirubin, a component derived from heme, as a potential ligand. This binding property was then demonstrated experimentally. Arachidonic acid (AA) was identified as an ApoD ligand with a much better affinity than that of progesterone or pregnenolone. AA is the precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, molecules that are involved in inflammation, platelet aggregation and cellular regulation. A very poor binding between ApoD and cholesterol has also been observed. Other ApoD ligands include E-3-methyl-2-hexenoïc acid, a molecule present in axillary secretions; retinoic acid which is involved in cellular differentiation; sphingomyelin and sphingolipids which are major components of HDL and cell membranes. The fact that apoD may bind such a large variety of ligands strongly support the hypothesis that it could be a multi-ligand multi-function protein.  Clinical significance  APOD is a biomarker of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). APOD is an androgen up-regulated gene in normal scrotal fibroblast cells in comparison to CAIS labia majora cells. APOD is associated with neurological disorders and nerve injury, especially related to myelin sheath. APOD was shown to be elevated in a rat model of stroke. APOD is elevated in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. = ApoD expression in cells and tissues = Analysis of the ApoD gene promoter region identified a large number of regulatory elements, among which response elements to steroids, estrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoids. Response elements to fatty acids, acute phase, serum and to the immune factor NFkB were also observed. The presence of such a large number of regulatory sequences suggests that the regulation of its expression is very complex. ApoD has been identified in 6 mammalian species as well as in chickens, fruit flies, plants and bacteria. In humans, monkeys, rabbits and guinea pigs, ApoD is highly expressed in the nervous system (brain, cerebellum and peripheral nerves). Otherwise, expression levels of ApoD vary largely from organs to organs and species to species, with humans displaying the most diverse expression of ApoD, and mice and rats almost exclusively expressing ApoD in the nervous system (see Figure 2). Rassart Figure 2 ApoD concentration in human plasma varies between 5 and 23 mg/100 ml. In the nervous system, the ApoD mRNA is expressed by fibroblasts, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes As a glycoprotein with a peptide signal, ApoD is secreted. Yet it can also be actively reinternalized. The transmembrane glycoprotein Basigin (BSG; CD147) was identified as an ApoD receptor. BSG is a membrane glycoprotein receptor, member of the immunoglobulin family, involved in several pathologies such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. = Modulation of ApoD expression = Studies on several cell types have shown that ApoD expression can be induced by several stressing situations such as growth arrest, senescence, oxidative and inflammatory stresses. ApoD expression is also increased in several neuropathologies. ApoD expression is modulated in several pathologies such as HDL familial deficiency, Tangier disease, LCAT familial deficit and type 2 diabetes. It is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovary, prostate, skin and central nervous system (CNS) cancer. In many cases, its expression is correlated with highly differentiated, non-invasive and non- metastatic state. A role in lipid metabolism has been identified for ApoD by a study on transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human ApoD in the CNS. These mice slowly develop a hepatic and muscular steatosis accompanied with insulin resistance. However, none of the Tg mice develop obesity nor diabetes. ApoD induced lipid accumulation is not due to de novo lipogenesis but rather from increased lipid uptake in response to prostaglandin overproduction. Plasma ApoD levels decrease significantly during normal uncomplicated pregnancy. ApoD is further decreased in women with excessive gestational weight gain and their newborns. In these women, the ApoD concentration was tightly associated with the lipid parameters. In morbidly obese women (BMI over 40) adipose tissues, ApoD protein expression is positively correlated with parameters of metabolic health. ApoD-null female mice (mice in which the ApoD gene was inactivated) present progressive (up to 50%) bone volume reduction with aging. = ApoD and the nervous system = Both ApoD and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein levels increase drastically at the site of regeneration following a nerve crush injury in the rat. Similar observations have been made in rabbits, marmoset monkeys and in mice. Elevated levels of ApoD were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid, hippocampus and cortex of human patients with Alzheimer’s disease, cerebrovascular disease, motoneuron disease, meningoencephalitis and stroke. ApoD expression is altered in plasma and post-mortem brains of schizophrenic patients. In patients with Parkinson’s disease or with multiple sclerosis, ApoD expression is strongly increased in glial cells of the substantia nigra. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a genetic disorder affecting cholesterol transport that is accompanied by chronic progressive neurodegeneration. In animal models of NPC, ApoD expression is increased in the plasma and the brain. In rats, ApoD expression increases in the hippocampus after enthorinal cortex lesioning. ApoD mRNA and protein increases in the ipsilateral region of hippocampus as early as 2 days post-lesion (DPL), remains high for 10 days and returns to normal after 14 DPL, a period considered necessary for a complete reinervation. Similar results are obtained after injection of kainic acid, an analog of glutamic acid which causes a severe neurodegenerative injury in the hippocampus or after experimentally- induced stoke. ApoD expression is also increased in the aging brain. Altogether, these data suggest that ApoD plays an important role in neural preservation and protection. Tg mice are less sensitive to oxidative stress induced by paraquat, a free oxygen radical generator, and present reduced lipid peroxidation levels. In contrast, apoD-null mice show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, increased brain lipid peroxidation and impaired locomotor and learning abilities. Similar results have been observed in a drosophila model. Mice infected with the human coronavirus OC43 develop encephalitis and inflammatory demyelination of the CNS, a disease very similar to multiple sclerosis. Tg mice infected with OC43 display increased survivability compared to control animals. Tg mice treated with kainic acid show a significant reduction of inflammatory responses and a much stronger protection against apoptosis in the hippocampus than control animals. ApoD- null mice crossed with APP-PS1 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, displayed a 2-fold increase of hippocampal amyloid plaque load. In contrast, the progeny of Tg mice crossed with APP-PS1 mice displayed reduced hippocampal plaque load by 35%, and a 35% to 65% reduction of amyloid peptide levels.

One of its functions is to bind cardiolipin. When bound, the structure of cardiolipin and β2-GP1 both undergo large changes in structure. Within the structure of Apo-H is a stretch of positively charged amino acids (protein sequence positions 282-287), Lys-Asn-Lys-Glu-Lys-Lys, are involved in phospholipid binding (see image on right). β2-GP1 has a complex involvement in agglutination. It appears to alter adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-mediated agglutination of platelets. Normally, β2-GP1 assumes an anticoagulation activity in serum (by inhibiting coagulation factors); however, changes in blood factors can result in a reversal of that activity. Although previously referred to as apolipoprotein H, it is not present in appreciable quantities in the lipoprotein fractions, so ApoH is therefore thought to be a misnomer. Inhibitory activities β2-GP1 appears to completely inhibit serotonin release by the platelets and prevents subsequent waves of the ADP-induced aggregation. The activity of β2-GP1 appears to involve the binding of agglutinating, negatively charged compounds, and inhibits agglutination by the contact activation of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway. β2-GP1 causes a reduction of the prothrombinase binding sites on platelets and reduces the activation caused by collagen when thrombin is present at physiological serum concentrations of β2-GP1 suggesting a regulatory role of β2-GP1 in coagulation. β2-GP1 also inhibits the generation of factor Xa in the presence of platelets. β2-GP1 also inhibits that activation of factor XIIa. In addition, β2-GP1 inhibits the activation of protein C blocking its activity on phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine vesicles however once protein C is activated, Apo-H fails to inhibit activity. Since protein C is involved in factor Va degradation Apo-H indirectly inhibits the degradation of factor Va. This inhibitory activity is diminished by adding phospholipids suggesting the Apo-H inhibition of protein C is phospholipid competitive. This indicates that under certain conditions Apo-H takes on procoagulation properties. Pathology Anti-β2-GP1 antibodies are found in both infectious and some systemic autoimmune diseases (eg. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)). Positivity for anti-cardiolipin antibodies in diagnostic tests for autoimmune antiphospholipid syndrome requires the presence of β2-GP1in the cardiolipin extract. Anti-β2-GP1 antibodies are strongly associated with thrombotic forms of lupus. Sushi 2 protein domain In molecular biology, the protein domain Sushi 2 is also known as the fifth protein domain of beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (β2-GP1). This protein domain is only found in eukaryotes. The first four domains found in Apolipoprotein H resemble each other, however the fifth one appears to be different. =Structure= This protein domain is composed of four well-defined anti-parallel beta-strands and two short alpha-helices, as well as a long highly flexible loop. Additionally, the fifth protein domain appears to resemble the other four in Apolipoprotein with the exception of three internal disulfide bonds and an extra C-terminal loop. =Function= Its exact function remains to be fully elucidated; however it is known to play an important role in the binding of β2-GP1 to negatively charged compounds and subsequent capture for binding of anti-β2-GP1 antibodies. Development of antibodies against β2-GP1 can lead to Antiphospholipid syndrome which often leads to pregnancy complications.

The hotel was established in 1897 by John W. Weatherford, and is located at 23 North Leroux Street, one block north of U.S. Route 66.  History  Disastrous fires plagued early Flagstaff, like most frontier towns. After a particularly bad series of blazes in 1897, the City passed an ordinance requiring all buildings in the business area to be built of brick, stone or iron. Among the new buildings appearing in the year 1898 was the Weatherford Hotel, built by John W. Weatherford (1859–1934), a native of Weatherford, Texas. The original structure housed a general store on the first floor, and the Weatherford family upstairs. In March 1899, Weatherford began construction of a brick three-story hotel addition, with a grand opening on New Year's Day, 1900. For years, the Weatherford Hotel was the most prominent hotel in Flagstaff, entertaining guests such as artist Thomas Moran, publisher William Randolf Hearst, and writer Zane Grey. Grey's famous novel \\"The Call of the Canyon\\" was written in the recently renovated Zane Grey Ballroom on the third floor of the hotel. A beautiful sunroom occupied part of the top floor and was used for dances and parties, while numerous civic groups engaged the downstairs. A three-sided balcony, visible in the 1905 photograph hanging in the Ballroom was damaged by fire and removed in 1929, along with the original cupola. At various times, the hotel housed a restaurant, theater, and billiard hall and radio station. Henry Taylor, the present owner, purchased the hotel in 1975 in an attempt to keep it from being demolished, at a time when the downtown area was in an acute state of disrepair and decline. Since then, Henry and his wife Pamela (Sam) have been continually renovating the structure, with the goal of restoring the hotel to its original grandeur. Today's Weatherford Hotel is still changing. The third floor Ballroom was renovated and reopened in 1997 and the first stage of reconstructing the wrap- around porches were finished in February 1999. When transcontinental telephone service first reached Flagstaff about 1910, a small brick building with a three-bay facade of red Coconino sandstone was erected south of the hotel to serve the telephone company, becoming part of the \\"Weatherford Block.\\" The building served its original purpose until at least the 1930s, when it underwent the first of two modernizations. The sandstone facade was stuccoed over in a modified art-deco style, and in the 1950s aluminum siding was added. It was known for some years as the \\"Le Brea Cafe\\", an establishment whose character does not appear to have elicited any significant historic recollection. The cafe facade renovation completed in 1995 restored the appearance of the original 1909 Telephone Exchange. The elegant simplicity and casual ambiance of the \\"Exchange Pub\\" is reminiscent of Flagstaff's at its around the start of the 20th century heyday. The renovation continues today with future expansions to include the development of the basement which was the original Hotel Pub & Restaurant in 1900. Also planned is the completion of the existing balconies which will wrap around to the west of the building. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The problem was posed by Robert P. Dilworth, and for many years it was one of the most famous and long-standing open problems in lattice theory; it had a deep impact on the development of lattice theory itself. The conjecture that every distributive lattice is a congruence lattice is true for all distributive lattices with at most ℵ1 compact elements, but F. Wehrung provided a counterexample for distributive lattices with ℵ2 compact elements using a construction based on Kuratowski's free set theorem. Preliminaries We denote by Con A the congruence lattice of an algebra A, that is, the lattice of all congruences of A under inclusion. The following is a universal- algebraic triviality. It says that for a congruence, being finitely generated is a lattice-theoretical property. Lemma. A congruence of an algebra A is finitely generated if and only if it is a compact element of Con A. As every congruence of an algebra is the join of the finitely generated congruences below it (e.g., every submodule of a module is the union of all its finitely generated submodules), we obtain the following result, first published by Birkhoff and Frink in 1948. Theorem (Birkhoff and Frink 1948). The congruence lattice Con A of any algebra A is an algebraic lattice. While congruences of lattices lose something in comparison to groups, modules, rings (they cannot be identified with subsets of the universe), they also have a property unique among all the other structures encountered yet. Theorem (Funayama and Nakayama 1942). The congruence lattice of any lattice is distributive. This says that α ∧ (β ∨ γ) = (α ∧ β) ∨ (α ∧ γ), for any congruences α, β, and γ of a given lattice. The analogue of this result fails, for instance, for modules, as A\\\\cap(B+C) eq(A\\\\cap B)+(A\\\\cap C), as a rule, for submodules A, B, C of a given module. Soon after this result, Dilworth proved the following result. He did not publish the result but it appears as an exercise credited to him in Birkhoff 1948. The first published proof is in Grätzer and Schmidt 1962. Theorem (Dilworth ≈1940, Grätzer and Schmidt 1962). Every finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite lattice. It is important to observe that the solution lattice found in Grätzer and Schmidt's proof is sectionally complemented, that is, it has a least element (true for any finite lattice) and for all elements a ≤ b there exists an element x with a ∨ x = b and a ∧ x = 0. It is also in that paper that CLP is first stated in published form, although it seems that the earliest attempts at CLP were made by Dilworth himself. Congruence lattices of finite lattices have been given an enormous amount of attention, for which a reference is Grätzer's 2005 monograph. \\\\---- The congruence lattice problem (CLP): Is every distributive algebraic lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some lattice? \\\\---- The problem CLP has been one of the most intriguing and longest-standing open problems of lattice theory. Some related results of universal algebra are the following. Theorem (Grätzer and Schmidt 1963). Every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra. The lattice Sub V of all subspaces of a vector space V is certainly an algebraic lattice. As the next result shows, these algebraic lattices are difficult to represent. Theorem (Freese, Lampe, and Taylor 1979). Let V be an infinite-dimensional vector space over an uncountable field F. Then Con A isomorphic to Sub V implies that A has at least card F operations, for any algebra A. As V is infinite- dimensional, the largest element (unit) of Sub V is not compact. However innocuous it sounds, the compact unit assumption is essential in the statement of the result above, as demonstrated by the following result. Theorem (Lampe 1982). Every algebraic lattice with compact unit is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some groupoid. Semilattice formulation of CLP The congruence lattice Con A of an algebra A is an algebraic lattice. The (∨,0)-semilattice of compact elements of Con A is denoted by Conc A, and it is sometimes called the congruence semilattice of A. Then Con A is isomorphic to the ideal lattice of Conc A. By using the classical equivalence between the category of all (∨,0)-semilattices and the category of all algebraic lattices (with suitable definitions of morphisms), as it is outlined here, we obtain the following semilattice-theoretical formulation of CLP. \\\\---- Semilattice- theoretical formulation of CLP: Is every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice isomorphic to the congruence semilattice of some lattice? \\\\---- Say that a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is representable, if it is isomorphic to Conc L, for some lattice L. So CLP asks whether every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is representable. Many investigations around this problem involve diagrams of semilattices or of algebras. A most useful folklore result about these is the following. Theorem. The functor Conc, defined on all algebras of a given signature, to all (∨,0)-semilattices, preserves direct limits. Schmidt's approach via distributive join-homomorphisms We say that a (∨,0)-semilattice satisfies Schmidt's Condition, if it is isomorphic to the quotient of a generalized Boolean semilattice B under some distributive join- congruence of B. One of the deepest results about representability of (∨,0)-semilattices is the following. Theorem (Schmidt 1968). Any (∨,0)-semilattice satisfying Schmidt's Condition is representable. This raised the following problem, stated in the same paper. \\\\---- Problem 1 (Schmidt 1968). Does any (∨,0)-semilattice satisfy Schmidt's Condition? \\\\---- Partial positive answers are the following. Theorem (Schmidt 1981). Every distributive lattice with zero satisfies Schmidt's Condition; thus it is representable. This result has been improved further as follows, via a very long and technical proof, using forcing and Boolean-valued models. Theorem (Wehrung 2003). Every direct limit of a countable sequence of distributive lattices with zero and (∨,0)-homomorphisms is representable. Other important representability results are related to the cardinality of the semilattice. The following result was prepared for publication by Dobbertin after Huhn's passing away in 1985. The two corresponding papers were published in 1989. Theorem (Huhn 1985). Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality at most ℵ1 satisfies Schmidt's Condition. Thus it is representable. By using different methods, Dobbertin got the following result. Theorem (Dobbertin 1986). Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice in which every principal ideal is at most countable is representable. \\\\---- Problem 2 (Dobbertin 1983). Is every conical refinement monoid measurable? \\\\---- Pudlák's approach; lifting diagrams of (∨,0)-semilattices The approach of CLP suggested by Pudlák in his 1985 paper is different. It is based on the following result, Fact 4, p. 100 in Pudlák's 1985 paper, obtained earlier by Ju.L. Ershov as the main theorem in Section 3 of the Introduction of his 1977 monograph. Theorem (Ershov 1977, Pudlák 1985). Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is the directed union of its finite distributive (∨,0)-subsemilattices. This means that every finite subset in a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice S is contained in some finite distributive (∨,0)-subsemilattice of S. Now we are trying to represent a given distributive (∨,0)-semilattice S as Conc L, for some lattice L. Writing S as a directed union S=\\\\bigcup(S_i\\\\mid i\\\\in I) of finite distributive (∨,0)-subsemilattices, we are hoping to represent each Si as the congruence lattice of a lattice Li with lattice homomorphisms fij : Li→ Lj, for i ≤ j in I, such that the diagram \\\\mathcal{S} of all Si with all inclusion maps Si→Sj, for i ≤ j in I, is naturally equivalent to (\\\\mathrm{Con_c}\\\\,L_i,\\\\mathrm{Con_c}\\\\,f_i^j\\\\mid i\\\\leq j\\\\text{ in }I), we say that the diagram (L_i,f_i^j\\\\mid i\\\\leq j\\\\text{ in }I) lifts \\\\mathcal{S} (with respect to the Conc functor). If this can be done, then, as we have seen that the Conc functor preserves direct limits, the direct limit L=\\\\varinjlim_{i\\\\in I}L_i satisfies {\\\\rm Con_c}\\\\,L\\\\cong S. While the problem whether this could be done in general remained open for about 20 years, Pudlák could prove it for distributive lattices with zero, thus extending one of Schmidt's results by providing a functorial solution. Theorem (Pudlák 1985). There exists a direct limits preserving functor Φ, from the category of all distributive lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings to the category of all lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings, such that ConcΦ is naturally equivalent to the identity. Furthermore, Φ(S) is a finite atomistic lattice, for any finite distributive (∨,0)-semilattice S. This result is improved further, by an even far more complex construction, to locally finite, sectionally complemented modular lattices by Růžička in 2004 and 2006. Pudlák asked in 1985 whether his result above could be extended to the whole category of distributive (∨,0)-semilattices with (∨,0)-embeddings. The problem remained open until it was recently solved in the negative by Tůma and Wehrung. Theorem (Tůma and Wehrung 2006). There exists a diagram D of finite Boolean (∨,0)-semilattices and (∨,0,1)-embeddings, indexed by a finite partially ordered set, that cannot be lifted, with respect to the Conc functor, by any diagram of lattices and lattice homomorphisms. In particular, this implies immediately that CLP has no functorial solution. Furthermore, it follows from deep 1998 results of universal algebra by Kearnes and Szendrei in so-called commutator theory of varieties that the result above can be extended from the variety of all lattices to any variety \\\\mathcal{V} such that all Con A, for A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{V}, satisfy a fixed nontrivial identity in the signature (∨,∧) (in short, with a nontrivial congruence identity). We should also mention that many attempts at CLP were also based on the following result, first proved by Bulman-Fleming and McDowell in 1978 by using a categorical 1974 result of Shannon, see also Goodearl and Wehrung in 2001 for a direct argument. Theorem (Bulman-Fleming and McDowell 1978). Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is a direct limit of finite Boolean (∨,0)-semilattices and (∨,0)-homomorphisms. It should be observed that while the transition homomorphisms used in the Ershov-Pudlák Theorem are (∨,0)-embeddings, the transition homomorphisms used in the result above are not necessarily one-to-one, for example when one tries to represent the three-element chain. Practically this does not cause much trouble, and makes it possible to prove the following results. Theorem. Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality at most ℵ1 is isomorphic to (1) Conc L, for some locally finite, relatively complemented modular lattice L (Tůma 1998 and Grätzer, Lakser, and Wehrung 2000). (2) The semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of some (not necessarily unital) von Neumann regular ring (Wehrung 2000). (3) Conc L, for some sectionally complemented modular lattice L (Wehrung 2000). (4) The semilattice of finitely generated normal subgroups of some locally finite group (Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung 2006). (5) The submodule lattice of some right module over a (non-commutative) ring (Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung 2006). Congruence lattices of lattices and nonstable K-theory of von Neumann regular rings We recall that for a (unital, associative) ring R, we denote by V(R) the (conical, commutative) monoid of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective right R-modules, see here for more details. Recall that if R is von Neumann regular, then V(R) is a refinement monoid. Denote by Idc R the (∨,0)-semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of R. We denote by L(R) the lattice of all principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring R. It is well known that L(R) is a complemented modular lattice. The following result was observed by Wehrung, building on earlier works mainly by Jónsson and Goodearl. Theorem (Wehrung 1999). Let R be a von Neumann regular ring. Then the (∨,0)-semilattices Idc R and Conc L(R) are both isomorphic to the maximal semilattice quotient of V(R). Bergman proves in a well-known unpublished note from 1986 that any at most countable distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is isomorphic to Idc R, for some locally matricial ring R (over any given field). This result is extended to semilattices of cardinality at most ℵ1 in 2000 by Wehrung, by keeping only the regularity of R (the ring constructed by the proof is not locally matricial). The question whether R could be taken locally matricial in the ℵ1 case remained open for a while, until it was disproved by Wehrung in 2004. Translating back to the lattice world by using the theorem above and using a lattice-theoretical analogue of the V(R) construction, called the dimension monoid, introduced by Wehrung in 1998, yields the following result. Theorem (Wehrung 2004). There exists a distributive (∨,0,1)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ1 that is not isomorphic to Conc L, for any modular lattice L every finitely generated sublattice of which has finite length. \\\\---- Problem 3 (Goodearl 1991). Is the positive cone of any dimension group with order-unit isomorphic to V(R), for some von Neumann regular ring R? \\\\---- A first application of Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem The abovementioned Problem 1 (Schmidt), Problem 2 (Dobbertin), and Problem 3 (Goodearl) were solved simultaneously in the negative in 1998. Theorem (Wehrung 1998). There exists a dimension vector space G over the rationals with order-unit whose positive cone G+ is not isomorphic to V(R), for any von Neumann regular ring R, and is not measurable in Dobbertin's sense. Furthermore, the maximal semilattice quotient of G+ does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. Furthermore, G can be taken of any given cardinality greater than or equal to ℵ2. It follows from the previously mentioned works of Schmidt, Huhn, Dobbertin, Goodearl, and Handelman that the ℵ2 bound is optimal in all three negative results above. As the ℵ2 bound suggests, infinite combinatorics are involved. The principle used is Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem, first published in 1951. Only the case n=2 is used here. The semilattice part of the result above is achieved via an infinitary semilattice-theoretical statement URP (Uniform Refinement Property). If we want to disprove Schmidt's problem, the idea is (1) to prove that any generalized Boolean semilattice satisfies URP (which is easy), (2) that URP is preserved under homomorphic image under a weakly distributive homomorphism (which is also easy), and (3) that there exists a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ2 that does not satisfy URP (which is difficult, and uses Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem). Schematically, the construction in the theorem above can be described as follows. For a set Ω, we consider the partially ordered vector space E(Ω) defined by generators 1 and ai,x, for i<2 and x in Ω, and relations a0,x+a1,x=1, a0,x ≥ 0, and a1,x ≥ 0, for any x in Ω. By using a Skolemization of the theory of dimension groups, we can embed E(Ω) functorially into a dimension vector space F(Ω). The vector space counterexample of the theorem above is G=F(Ω), for any set Ω with at least ℵ2 elements. This counterexample has been modified subsequently by Ploščica and Tůma to a direct semilattice construction. For a (∨,0)-semilattice, the larger semilattice R(S) is the (∨,0)-semilattice freely generated by new elements t(a,b,c), for a, b, c in S such that c ≤ a ∨ b, subjected to the only relations c=t(a,b,c) ∨ t(b,a,c) and t(a,b,c) ≤ a. Iterating this construction gives the free distributive extension D(S)=\\\\bigcup(R^n(S)\\\\mid n<\\\\omega) of S. Now, for a set Ω, let L(Ω) be the (∨,0)-semilattice defined by generators 1 and ai,x, for i<2 and x in Ω, and relations a0,x ∨ a1,x=1, for any x in Ω. Finally, put G(Ω)=D(L(Ω)). In most related works, the following uniform refinement property is used. It is a modification of the one introduced by Wehrung in 1998 and 1999. Definition (Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung 1998). Let e be an element in a (∨,0)-semilattice S. We say that the weak uniform refinement property WURP holds at e, if for all families (a_i)_{i\\\\in I} and (b_i)_{i\\\\in I} of elements in S such that ai ∨ bi=e for all i in I, there exists a family (c_{i,j}\\\\mid (i,j)\\\\in I\\\\times I) of elements of S such that the relations • ci,j ≤ ai,bj, • ci,j ∨ aj ∨ bi=e, • ci,k ≤ ci,j∨ cj,k hold for all i, j, k in I. We say that S satisfies WURP, if WURP holds at every element of S. By building on Wehrung's abovementioned work on dimension vector spaces, Ploščica and Tůma proved that WURP does not hold in G(Ω), for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ2. Hence G(Ω) does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. All negative representation results mentioned here always make use of some uniform refinement property, including the first one about dimension vector spaces. However, the semilattices used in these negative results are relatively complicated. The following result, proved by Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung in 1998, is more striking, because it shows examples of representable semilattices that do not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. We denote by FV(Ω) the free lattice on Ω in V, for any variety V of lattices. Theorem (Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung 1998). The semilattice Conc FV(Ω) does not satisfy WURP, for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ2 and any non- distributive variety V of lattices. Consequently, Conc FV(Ω) does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. It is proved by Tůma and Wehrung in 2001 that Conc FV(Ω) is not isomorphic to Conc L, for any lattice L with permutable congruences. By using a slight weakening of WURP, this result is extended to arbitrary algebras with permutable congruences by Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung in 2006. Hence, for example, if Ω has at least ℵ2 elements, then Conc FV(Ω) is not isomorphic to the normal subgroup lattice of any group, or the submodule lattice of any module. Solving CLP: the Erosion Lemma The following recent theorem solves CLP. Theorem (Wehrung 2007). The semilattice G(Ω) is not isomorphic to Conc L for any lattice L, whenever the set Ω has at least ℵω+1 elements. Hence, the counterexample to CLP had been known for nearly ten years, it is just that nobody knew why it worked! All the results prior to the theorem above made use of some form of permutability of congruences. The difficulty was to find enough structure in congruence lattices of non- congruence-permutable lattices. We shall denote by ε the \`parity function' on the natural numbers, that is, ε(n)=n mod 2, for any natural number n. We let L be an algebra possessing a structure of semilattice (L,∨) such that every congruence of L is also a congruence for the operation ∨ . We put : U\\\\vee V=\\\\\\\\{u\\\\vee v \\\\mid (u,v)\\\\in U\\\\times V\\\\\\\\},\\\\quad \\\\text{for all }U,V\\\\subseteq L, and we denote by ConcU L the (∨,0)-subsemilattice of Conc L generated by all principal congruences Θ(u,v) ( = least congruence of L that identifies u and v), where (u,v) belongs to U ×U. We put Θ+(u,v)=Θ(u ∨ v,v), for all u, v in L.br /> The Erosion Lemma (Wehrung 2007). Let x0, x1 in L and let Z=\\\\\\\\{z_0,z_1,\\\\dots,z_n\\\\\\\\}, for a positive integer n, be a finite subset of L with \\\\bigvee_{i. Put :\\\\alpha_j=\\\\bigvee(\\\\Theta_L(z_i,z_{i+1})\\\\mid i Then there are congruences \\\\theta_j\\\\in\\\\mathrm{Con_c}^{\\\\\\\\{x_j\\\\\\\\}\\\\vee Z}L, for j<2, such that : z_0\\\\vee x_0\\\\vee x_1\\\\equiv z_n\\\\vee x_0\\\\vee x_1 \\\\pmod{\\\\theta_0\\\\vee\\\\theta_1}\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\theta_j\\\\subseteq\\\\alpha_j\\\\cap\\\\Theta_L^+(z_n,x_j),\\\\text{ for all }j<2\\\\. (Observe the faint formal similarity with first-order resolution in mathematical logic. Could this analogy be pushed further?) The proof of the theorem above runs by setting a structure theorem for congruence lattices of semilattices—namely, the Erosion Lemma, against non-structure theorems for free distributive extensions G(Ω), the main one being called the Evaporation Lemma. While the latter are technically difficult, they are, in some sense, predictable. Quite to the contrary, the proof of the Erosion Lemma is elementary and easy, so it is probably the strangeness of its statement that explains that it has been hidden for so long. More is, in fact, proved in the theorem above: For any algebra L with a congruence-compatible structure of join-semilattice with unit and for any set Ω with at least ℵω+1 elements, there is no weakly distributive homomorphism μ: Conc L → G(Ω) containing 1 in its range. In particular, CLP was, after all, not a problem of lattice theory, but rather of universal algebra—even more specifically, semilattice theory! These results can also be translated in terms of a uniform refinement property, denoted by CLR in Wehrung's paper presenting the solution of CLP, which is noticeably more complicated than WURP. Finally, the cardinality bound ℵω+1 has been improved to the optimal bound ℵ2 by Růžička. Theorem (Růžička 2008). The semilattice G(Ω) is not isomorphic to Conc L for any lattice L, whenever the set Ω has at least ℵ2 elements. Růžička's proof follows the main lines of Wehrung's proof, except that it introduces an enhancement of Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem, called there existence of free trees, which it uses in the final argument involving the Erosion Lemma. A positive representation result for distributive semilattices The proof of the negative solution for CLP shows that the problem of representing distributive semilattices by compact congruences of lattices already appears for congruence lattices of semilattices. The question whether the structure of partially ordered set would cause similar problems is answered by the following result. Theorem (Wehrung 2008). For any distributive (∨,0)-semilattice S, there are a (∧,0)-semilattice P and a map μ : P × P → S such that the following conditions hold: (1) x ≤ y implies that μ(x,y)=0, for all x, y in P. (2) μ(x,z) ≤ μ(x,y) ∨ μ(y,z), for all x, y, z in P. (3) For all x ≥ y in P and all α, β in S such that μ(x,y) ≤ α ∨ β, there are a positive integer n and elements x=z0 ≥ z1 ≥ ... ≥ z2n=y such that μ(zi,zi+1) ≤ α (resp., μ(zi,zi+1) ≤ β) whenever i < 2n is even (resp., odd). (4) S is generated, as a join-semilattice, by all the elements of the form μ(x,0), for x in P. Furthermore, if S has a largest element, then P can be assumed to be a lattice with a largest element. It is not hard to verify that conditions (1)–(4) above imply the distributivity of S, so the result above gives a characterization of distributivity for (∨,0)-semilattices. References *G.M.
