Howton caught a total 503 career passes for a total of 8,459 yards. In doing so, he surpassed then leader Don Hutson to become the all-time leader in receptions and yardage. (Since then his ranking has fallen to below 50.) Despite this, he has yet to be named a finalist in Pro Football Hall of Fame balloting. He retired after the 1963 season, after four years with Dallas. In 2004, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's second HOVG class Early years Howton attended Plainview High School, where he lettered in football, basketball, and track and field. Howton played college football at Rice Institute in Houston, where he was nicknamed \\"Red Fox\\" not only for his hair color, but also for the way he ran pass patterns, which made him a great offensive end, establishing a season record for average yards (22.6) on pass receptions. At the 1948 track and field regional meet in Lubbock, he had a time of 14.3 in the high hurdle event, setting a record that stood for several decades. In 1951, he won the high hurdle event in a track meet against the Texas A&M; Aggies. He was also a notable runner in the low hurdles. In 1951, he finished his college football career with 64 catches for 1,289 yards and 12 touchdowns, on his way to earn the following honors: * All-America. * Southwest Conference MVP. * All-SWC team. * Won the George Martin Award for the second straight year (he also won it in 1950), which is given to Rice's most valuable football player. * Played in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. * Played in the College All-Star Game in Chicago in August 1952. In 1971, he was inducted into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career =Green Bay Packers= Howton was selected in the second round of the 1952 NFL draft, 15th overall, by the Green Bay Packers. As a rookie, he earned immediate comparisons with hall of famer Don Hutson, with his speed, sure hands, and big-play ability. He established himself as one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, with a league-leading 1,231 receiving yards. He also set a rookie record with 13 touchdowns, which would last until 1965 when the total number was broken by Gale Sayers. His touchdown reception mark lasted until 1998, when it was broken by Randy Moss. Howton became one of the most successful wide receivers in Packers history, while playing seven seasons in losing teams (26‚Äì56‚Äì2). During his seven years in Green Bay, he led his teams in receiving yards for six straight seasons (1952‚Äì57), led the league in receiving yards 2 times (1952 and 1956) and touchdown receptions once (1956). He caught 303 passes for 5,581 yards with an 18.4 yard average, scored 43 touchdowns and earned All-Pro in two seasons (1956‚Äì57) and Pro Bowl honors in four seasons (1952 and 1955‚Äì57). He caught 13 touchdown passes in his 1952 rookie season. In his fifth season in 1956, Howton caught seven passes for a total of 257 yards against the Los Angeles Rams. He set team records that still stand today: * Most receiving yards by a rookie with 1,231 yards in 1952 * Highest yardage game with 257 yards against the Los Angeles Rams in 1956. * Two 200-plus receiving games - the only Packer receiver aside from Don Hutson, with four, to have more than one. Howton was named the Packers' player representative and president of the NFL Players Association in 1958, and played a major role in establishing a pension fund for players, which was a debated topic with club owners at the time. In January 1959, the Packers hired Vince Lombardi as head coach and general manager after the team's worst record ever (1‚Äì10‚Äì1) in 1958. In April, Lombardi traded Howton to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for defensive end Bill Quinlan and halfback Lew Carpenter. Lombardi desired receivers who could block, which was not Howton's strength. Through the years, there has been speculation that his NFL Players Association ties were the real reason behind the trade. Howton was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1974. =Cleveland Browns= Howton played only one season in Cleveland, leading the team in receptions with 39, and experiencing what would be the only winning campaign of his NFL career. At the start of the 1960 season, he notified the Browns his intentions to retire. The expansion Dallas Cowboys convinced him to play in his home state and traded a draft choice to the Browns in exchange for his rights. =Dallas Cowboys= Howton was acquired by the expansion Dallas Cowboys in 1960. That season the Cowboys recorded only a tie, which came against the New York Giants at Yankee Stadium on December 4, when a late touchdown pass from Eddie LeBaron to Howton finalized a 31‚Äì31 comeback, against a team that had made championship game appearances in three of the previous four years. Following the season, Howton signed a three-year contract. The first win in franchise history came during the 1961 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 27‚Äì24, with Howton contributing a game-high 138 receiving yards and a touchdown. During his time with the Cowboys, Howton remained a key starter in a league-leading offense, that was composed by Eddie LeBaron, Don Meredith, Don Perkins, Frank Clarke, Dick Bielski, and Lee Folkins. He led the Cowboys in receiving in 1961 (with a career-high of 56 catches) and again in 1962. On September 29, 1963, Howton became the NFL's all-time receiving leader, after breaking Don Hutson's record for career receptions and receiving yards. He retired after playing in 12 seasons with 503 catches, 8,459 yards and 61 touchdowns. Howton was also the top receiver from those players in the 1952 NFL draft including hall of famers Frank Gifford, Ollie Matson, and Hugh McElhenny. His 61 TDs are only two less than leader Matson.

History  = Early fortifications = The Hexamilion stands at the end of a long series of attempts to fortify the isthmus stretching back to perhaps the Mycenean period.See Broneer and Wiseman for arguments for pre-Roman fortification walls across the isthmus. Many of the Peloponnesian cities wanted to pull back and fortify the isthmus instead of making a stand at Thermopylae when Xerxes invaded in 480 BC (Herodotus' Histories 7.206). The issue arose again before the Battle of Salamis (Herodotos 8.40, 49, 56). Although the concept of a \\"Fortress Peloponnese\\" had been repeatedly suggested, fortification of the isthmus was of no utility without control of the sea, as Herodotus notes (7.138). = The Hexamilion and its history = The wall was constructed in the period between 408 AD and 450 AD, in the reign of Theodosius II during the time of the great Barbarian invasions into the Roman Empire. The attack of Alaric on Greece in 396 AD or the sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths may have motivated the construction, which included towers, sea bastions, and at minimum one fortress.Gregory uses numismatic evidence to date the construction to 400 to 420 AD. The one known fortress contained two gates (north and south), of which the northern gate functioned as the formal entrance to the Peloponnese.Gregory describes the development of this northern gateway from its origin as a 1st-century CE Roman arch. The wall was constructed with a rubble and mortar core faced with squared stones. It is not certain how long it took to complete, but the importance given to the task is apparent from the scale of the construction; the Hexamilion is the largest archaeological structure in Greece. Every structure in the region was cannibalized for stone for the effort, either being incorporated into the wall directly, as was the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia, or being burned into lime, as was the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora as well as much of the ancient statuary of Corinth. In the reign of Justinian, the wall was fortified with additional towers, reaching a total number of 153. Military use appears to have fallen off after the 7th century AD, and by the 11th AD domestic structures were being built into the wall. In 1415, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II personally supervised repairs over a period of forty days. The high cost of this effort caused unrest among the local elite. The wall was breached in 1423 and again in 1431 by the Ottomans under the command of Turahan Bey. Constantine Palaiologos, who was Despot of Morea before his accession to the throne of the Byzantine empire, restored the wall again in 1444, but the Ottomans breached it again in 1446 and in October 1452. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese in 1460, the wall was abandoned. During its history, the wall never succeeded in fulfilling the function for which it was constructed, unless it acted as a deterrent. Elements of the wall are preserved south of the Corinth Canal and at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia.

A niece of Hampton Del Ruth and Roy Del Ruth, Chapman was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward a Bigley. She was educated in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, California. She went from a finishing school directly into movies. In ' (1920) she played the character of Mary Holmes in a photoplay written by Upton Sinclair. The setting is the \\"Oriental underworld\\" of New York City. Chapman dons twenty-two gowns in all, ranging from filmy negligee to elaborate fur-trimmed costumes. She was among the cast of Wildfire (1921), based on a Zane Grey novel. Two complete producing crews shot the movie, which was an outdoor narrative. The setting was the mythical Spanish state of Chinora. An American mining engineer is drilling for oil there. In her final movie, Garrison's Finish (1923), Chapman was paired with Jack Pickford. The story was about the race track and racing. Between 1918 and 1923 Chapman has ten screen credits in a brief Hollywood film career. Other movies in which she acted include Her Country First (1918), Daddy-Long-Legs with Mary Pickford, Black Sheep (1921), and Golden Dreams (1922).

Nikolaidi sang leading mezzo-soprano roles with major opera companies worldwide and made numerous recordings. Her birth year is given as 1906 in some sources. Early life and musical study Elena Nikolaidi was born in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (which is now ƒ∞zmir, Turkey). In 1922, after the invasion of Turkey in Smyrna, she moved with her family to Greece. She studied voice on scholarship at the Athens Conservatoire under Thanos Mellos. She made her debut with orchestra in Athens in a performance conducted by Dimitris Mitropoulos. Her first stage appearance was in the premiere of The Ghost Bridge by Theophrastos Sakellaridis. Nikolaidi married Mellos, her voice instructor, in 1936. However, she would retain \\"Elena Nikolaidi\\" as her professional name. Career In 1936, Nikolaidi traveled to Vienna to compete in the Belvedere vocal competition. She placed fourth but earned a second hearing with the great conductor Bruno Walter, which resulted in her being cast as Princess Eboli, a leading role, in Verdi's opera Don Carlos with the Vienna State Opera on December 16, 1936. In 1948, Nikolaidi went to the United States with her husband and their son, Michael. She made her Town Hall debut recital in New York City in January 1949. The following morning, Jerome D. Bohm of the New York Herald Tribune wrote: \\"In 20 years of music reviewing and in twice that number spent in listening to most of the world's best singers, I have encountered no greater voice or vocalist\\"; the New York Times critic wrote of her \\"rare brilliance.\\" She made her American operatic debut as Amneris in Verdi's A√Øda with the San Francisco Opera and reprised the role for her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1951 alongside the debut of George London. In the early 1960s she retired from opera but continued concertizing extensively for a number of years. Teaching career In 1960, Nikolaidi accepted a position on the voice faculty of Florida State University in Tallahassee. In 1977, she went to Houston, Texas, as the primary voice instructor for the newly established Houston Opera Studio, a young-artist training program that was at that time a joint venture of Houston Grand Opera and the University of Houston; she also instructed a select few university students who were not in the HOS program. Nikolaidi's pupils included Linda Zoghby. Death Madame Nikolaidi retired from teaching in 1994 and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where she died, aged 92, in 2002. Recordings Elena Nikolaidi made numerous recordings. A small selection is listed below: *Legendary Voices (CD, Preiser Records; also issued as Lebendige Vergangenheit by Albany Music Distribution). Nikolaidi with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, and pianist Jan Behr performing music of Rossini, Verdi, Bizet, Weber, Richard Strauss, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms. (Recorded 1943, 1949, 1950; released 2003) *Elena Nikolaidi: In Recital (DVD, Video Artists International). Nikolaidi with Guy Bourassa, piano, performing music of Gluck, Wolf, Canteloube, and traditional Greek songs. (Recorded 1961; released 2005) *A recording of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, recorded live in 1953 with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic and released on an Archipel CD in 1997 and 2003. In some sources this recording is credited to Bulgarian mezzo- soprano Elena Nicolai, but that is probably an error. References Sources *\\"Ciao, Niki\\" by Charles Ward.

Originally a sporadic series airing on Saturday mornings, Sunday afternoons, or weekday afternoons beginning in February 1967, it became a regularly scheduled program in 1971 on the CBS Saturday-morning lineup, running one hour with some films apparently edited down to fit the time slot. The program was hosted by 1950s television act Kukla, Fran and Ollie, a.k.a. puppeteer Burr Tillstrom and actress Fran Allison. Kukla, Fran and Ollie were dropped from the series in 1977 and the program was renamed CBS Saturday Film Festival.CBS Children's Film Festival at TVGuide.com. Archived from the original on September 6, 2015. In 1978 CBS canceled the show in favor of the youth-targeted magazine 30 Minutes which was modeled after its adult sister show 60 Minutes. CBS canceled 30 Minutes in 1982 and brought back Saturday Film Festival which ran for two seasons until CBS cancelled it for good in 1984. Perhaps the most famous \\"episode\\" of the series was the 1960 British film Hand in Hand, the story of a deep friendship between two elementary school students, one a Roman Catholic boy and the other a Jewish girl. In addition to many American and British films, the series also featured motion pictures from Russia, France, Bulgaria, Japan, Sweden, Italy, China, Australia, South Africa, and Czechoslovakia, as well as several other countries. Other films that aired during the series run include the Academy Award-winning French film The Red Balloon; Skinny and Fatty from Japan; Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World from Great Britain; Tillie, the Unhappy Hippopotamus from Czechoslovakia; and Mi-Mi, the Lazy Kitten from China. Actor Ray Bolger, a star of The Wizard of Oz, served as narrator for some of the episodes during the show's 1980s run.

The Bath Herald was merged with the Bath Chronicle in 1925 to become the Bath Chronicle and Herald, amended in 1936 to Bath Weekly Chronicle and Herald. The early 1960s was a time for another minor name change to Bath and Wilts Evening Chronicle. The change took place with the issue of 12 June 1961, but was again changed, with the issue of 1 April 1974 to Bath and West Evening Chronicle, before changing to the Evening Chronicle with the issue of 3 January 1989, remaining with that title until 7 May 1994.British Library catalogue entries In October 2007, the Bath Chronicle switched from daily to weekly publication, every Thursday.

Filmed in the summer of 1960 under the title \\"The Star and the Cross\\", Hand in Hand was released theatrically in the United States in 1961 by Columbia Pictures. Although ABPC's distribution arm in the United Kingdom, Warner-Pathe Film Distributors, screened the film for the British press in late 1960, it remained unreleased in the UK until 1963, when it finally went out nationally on the ABC cinema circuit as the supporting feature for the Tony Hancock comedy The Punch and Judy Man. It was shown to American children and adults when released on the CBS Children's Film Festival 1967 season hosted by Kukla, Fran and Ollie. Plot Michael O'Malley (Needs), rushes to his priest to tearfully inform him that he has accidentally killed his closest friend, Rachel Mathias (Parry). The story is told in flashback as Michael recounts their friendship, when he first befriended Rachel by hurrying her away from a group of schoolboys who were verbally bullying her on the playground. They quickly become the best of friends. The young children decide to become \\"blood brothers\\" by pricking their fingers and rubbing the blood together. They set off for an adventure, hoping to go to London to visit the queen, but instead are picked up by a kindly elderly lady (Sybil Thorndike) who takes them to her home for tea, pretending that she is a princess and that her mansion is one of the queen's homes, but that the queen is currently away. Her amiable deception goes over perfectly, and the children have a great time visiting with her. Michael and Rachel are aware that they go to church on different days and their religions are somewhat different, but they do not ponder the specifics. However, when a somewhat overbearing and destructively-outspoken classmate informs Michael that Rachel is Jewish and that \\"the Jews killed Christ\\", an outraged Michael rushes to Rachel at their clubhouse and angrily confronts her, \\"Why did you kill Christ?\\" Rachel is shocked and insistently denies it: \\"I didn't kill him. I don't even know him.\\" Michael and Rachel conclude that God is angry at them for becoming friends, but they are not sure if He will forgive them. They decide to attend church with each other to see if God is mad at them, believing they will die if He does not want them to go to each other's church. Michael sneaks into the synagogue with Rachel the next Saturday and is somewhat puzzled and intimidated by the ceremony, but he stays and seems to like it as time goes on, especially after a kindly rabbi shows him a passage in the Torah that speaks of God's love shielding him from all fear. The next day, Rachel goes with Michael to his church, and while Rachel is initially somewhat unnerved by the services and statues, she too feels more comfortable after a while. Having concluded it is acceptable to God that they remain friends, Michael and Rachel decide to take an inflatable raft on the River Thames for their next adventure, a trip to Africa. All goes well at first as Michael paddles and the raft drifts leisurely and makes smooth ripples on the calm water, but then the raft enters a dangerous area of the river with a swifter flow and strong rapids; Michael loses control, and Rachel is knocked overboard. Due to the stronger current and the riverbank's dense underbrush in which Rachel has become entangled, Michael has great difficulty reaching her, but at last pulls her out of the river; however, she is limp and unresponsive. Fearing the worst, Michael frantically rushes to get help, and adults in the area call for an ambulance. The film then returns to the present moment, with Michael in his grief-stricken state, and telling the priest that he's killed Rachel. The priest comforts him and tells him that Rachel may be all right, and then accompanies him to Rachel's home to see how she is. They are met at the front door by Rachel's rabbi who is leaving, and he informs them that Rachel has pulled through and is recovering well, but that perhaps it would be better to wait till tomorrow to visit her. Michael, immensely relieved, rushes home happy that his little friend is alive, and the priest and the rabbi, who have, earlier in the film been established as being good friends --- acknowledging that their respective religions hold more in common than they may have realized before --- speak warmly to each other before walking away in different directions.

In 1968 Brian Smith replaced Ron Lee on drums and when Dave Bradley exited the group they became a three piece with Peter Kimberley on a six string Fender bass. They had close links with the Birmingham Arts Lab, a venue for experimental artists of all types, and often performed with a full psychedelic light show. Following a publicity campaign which included subverting a large department store's marketing logo and a photo-shoot with a piano in a local fountain, they left the country. They subsequently found themselves in Paris, long the refuge of revolutionary artists and artistic revolutionaries. After the events of May 1968, France was ready for new ideas and new music and English rock bands were much in vogue at the time. Bachdenkel settled in France and over the next decade went on to produce two albums: the first of these, Lemmings, is generally regarded as their best. At times in their career, they shared the billing with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath amongst others and provided the music for a modern ballet.

The point clip clamps the end of a moving rail (the switch rail) of a set of points to its associated stock rail, and the scotch is a timber wedge used to ensure that the other moving rail is kept away from its associated stock rail. In this way the points are fixed in either the 'normal' or 'reverse' positions and cannot be moved by the usual setting mechanisms. For infrequently used points, this guards against mechanical failure of the points leaving them in a condition to derail trains. The 'clip and scotch' method can also be used to positively deny access to the turnout or mainline. Scotch block A 'scotch block' is not used, as this is a different piece of equipment clamped to a rail used to ensure that stationary railway vehicles do not move, with much the same function as chocks used to keep aircraft stationary. Spike and wedge In North America the term Spike and Wedge is used as instead of a clip, a rail spike is driven through a hole set in the metal base plate that is located flush up against the switch rail, holding it in place against the stock rail. The block of wood set in the open gap is known as the wedge and is functionally equivalent to a scotch.

It is administered by the Florida Forest Service, part of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Blackwater River State Forest is completely contained within Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties. The forest is managed from a common headquarters in Munson, Florida. There are local ranger offices in Molino (Escambia County), Milton, (Santa Rosa County), and Baker (Okaloosa County).  Name  The forest shares its name with the Blackwater River, which rises in southern Alabama and flows south dividing Okaloosa and Santa Rosa before emptying into the Blackwater Bay.  History  Federal Forest and Department of Defense land was originally donated to the state of Florida in the 1950s to manage for timber and recreation. These tracts of land comprised close to 50,000 acres of primarily Longleaf, Slash, and Loblolly pine plantations with scattered scrub resulting from years of mismanagement. Over time multiple acquisitions have been made to extend the size of the forests. Most of the additions have been from purchasing private timber company land while others have come from smaller private land owners.  Recreation  The forest offers many recreational opportunities. Multiple camping areas, both developed and primitive are located throughout the forest. Krul Campground has two camp grounds and a day use area. Bear Lake Campground has a campground with water and power and a second campground with only water for tent campers. There is also a pavilion available for use at Bear Lake. To the North is Hurricane Lake with a campground on the north and south shores. The south campground does not have electricity at its campsites. All lakes, excluding Krul lake, are open for fishing and are managed and stocked by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

It is characterized by an elongated, segmented body, a flattened shield-like brownish carapace covering two thirds of the thorax, and two long filaments on the abdomen. The genus name Triops comes from Ancient Greek ·Ω§œà or ·πìps, meaning \\"eye\\" prefixed with Latin tri-, \\"three\\", in reference to its three eyes. Longicaudatus is a Latin neologism combining longus (\\"long\\") and caudatus (\\"tailed\\"), referring to its long tail structures. Triops longicaudatus is found in freshwater ponds and pools, often in places where few higher forms of life can exist. Like its relative Triops cancriformis, the longtail tadpole shrimp is considered a living fossil because its basic prehistoric morphology has changed little in the last 70 million years, exactly matching their ancient fossils. Triops longicaudatus is one of the oldest animal species still in existence.Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. Volume 02 ‚Äì Protostomes. Chapter 14 ‚Äì Order NotostracaEncarta Encyclopedia 2005. Article ‚Äì Branchiopoda Classification Triops longicaudatus is a member of the crustacean class Branchiopoda, which primarily contains freshwater animals with gills on their legs. The class Branchiopoda is divided into the subclasses Sarsostraca, containing fairy shrimp, and Phyllopoda, containing all other members (cladocerans, clam shrimps, and the tadpole shrimp). The subclass name, literally meaning leaf- footed, is derived from their flat, leaflike appendages. Notostracans are placed in the infraclass Calamanostraca, which also contains the extinct Kazacharthra. Structure Triops longicaudatus is usually greyish yellow or brown in color, and differs from many other species by the absence of the second maxilla. Apart from Triops cancriformis, it is the only tadpole shrimp species whose individuals display as many as three reproductive strategies: bisexual, unisexual (parthenogenetic), and hermaphroditic; see below. Triops cancriformis is easily recognizable by its yellow carapace with dark spots, whilst T. longicaudatus individuals have a uniform carapace. The species also appeared about 50 million years later, and, as its name suggests, its elongated tail structures (cercopods) are often nearly as long as the rest of the body; including the cercopods, the body may reach in length. External anatomy of Triops longicaudatus (click on image for captions) The head of Triops longicaudatus is typical of crustaceans and consists of five segments, but there is a tendency toward reduction of cephalic appendages. The trunk is not distinctly divided into thorax and abdomen. Most trunk segments bear appendages. Zoologists find it difficult to decide where the thorax stops and the abdomen begins; the debate is seemingly endless. The first eleven trunk segments each bear a single pair of limbs. They are followed by segments that are fused similarly to those of millipedes, and as a result, each segment bears up to six pairs of limbs. The trunk ends with a region of limbless segments. Some zoologists consider the thorax to consist of the two regions with appendages, and the abdomen the region without appendages. Others believe the region of fused segments to be part of the abdomen. For clarity, this article uses \\"thorax\\" to mean the two body regions with limbs. =Carapace= There is a carapace present, but no cephalothorax, since no thoracic segment is fused with the head. The terms carapace and cephalothorax often are confused, but should not be. The carapace of crustaceans is a fold of the body wall of the fifth head segment. =Head= Mouthparts: 1 ‚Äì ventral groove; 2 ‚Äì labrum (upper lip); 3 ‚Äì mandible The head bears a pair of dorsal compound eyes that lie close to each other and are nearly fused together. The compound eyes are generally sessile (not stalked). In addition, there is a naupliar ocellus (the \\"third eye\\") between them. The compound eyes are on the surface of the head, but the ocellus is deep within the head. All the eyes, however, are easily visible through the shell covering of the head. A distinct horizontal groove, known as the mandibular groove, marks the division between the anterior three head segments and the posterior two. Posterior to it is the cervical groove, marking the division between the head and the thorax. On the ventral side of the head is a lenslike window, admitting light to the naupliar eye, which is aimed both dorsally and ventrally. The first antennae (antennules) are small, slender filaments on the ventral surface of the head, at about the same level as the eyes. The second antennae are similar and lie laterally to the first. They are nonfunctioning. The large, well-developed mandibles oppose each other across the ventral midline. The opposing surfaces bear strong brownish teeth. As the crustacean periodically opens and closes the mandibles the teeth move apart and close together. Of the usual crustacean head appendages, only the mandibles are well developed. In Triops longicaudatus, the larger second maxillae are absent, only maxillules being present. =Thorax= Magnified leg (thoracopod): 1‚Äì5 ‚Äì endites; 6 ‚Äì endopod; 7 ‚Äì exopod; 8 ‚Äì epipod; 9 ‚Äì protopod The anterior thorax consists of eleven segments, each bearing a pair of appendages, called thoracopods or pereiopods. None of the thoracopods are modified into maxillipeds for feeding. The posterior thorax consists of 16‚Äì25 segments, incompletely separated to form rings. Each ring may consist of as many as six fused segments and bear up to six pairs of appendages (there are 54‚Äì66 limbs altogether). Most of the thoracic appendages resemble each other, but the first eleven pairs are best developed. There is a slight tendency to regional specialization and the first pair of legs is unlike the rest. It is an elongated, cheliped-like structure with a sensory function, while all the other appendages aid in feeding, respiration, and locomotion. In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into brood pouches. The many legs posterior to the eleventh pair move the spent feeding and respiratory currents away. =Abdomen= The posterior 5‚Äì14 rings at the end of the body do not bear appendages. At the end of the body is a pleotelson (fusion of the last abdominal segment and the telson) connected to long, multisegmented uropods. =Feeding behavior= The feeding method of tadpole shrimps is similar to that proposed for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes at the base of the leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir and lift the sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg. =Internal anatomy= The heart of tadpole shrimps is a long dorsal tube in the anterior eleven trunk segments. It has a pair of ostia in each of these segments. Sometimes hemoglobin is present in its blood and the crustacean may be pink as a result. The excretory organs are the paired maxillary glands, located on the segment of the second maxilla. The long looped ducts of these glands can be seen in the carapace. The role of the maxillary glands is primarily osmoregulatory. Nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, is lost by diffusion across the gill surfaces. Reproduction and development =Reproduction= Triops longicaudatus displays several reproductive strategies. Individuals may reproduce sexually, but this is rare, as most populations are highly male- or female-biased. Parthenogenesis (development from unfertilized eggs) is the most common reproductive strategy. Some populations, however, consist of hermaphrodites who fertilize each other. Different populations display different strategies or combinations of strategies, and may therefore, be considered separate species or subspecies in the future. In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into egg sacs, where the eggs are carried for several hours. The eggs are released in batches, have a thick shell, and can stand freezing temperatures as well as drought, enabling the population to survive from one season to the next. The eggs have to dry out completely before being submerged in water again in order to hatch successfully; they may remain in a state of diapause for up to 20 years. These eggs may have helped Triops longicaudatus, as well as other notostracans, to survive the various natural disasters and mass extinctions to date. =Life cycle= To complete their lives, tadpole shrimps depend on the changing nature of the temporary waters they inhabit. During the dry season (summer and fall), their offspring stay inside the eggs. As the pool fills with rainwater during the winter and spring, they hatch and feed on fairy shrimps and other invertebrates. The first larval stage (the metanauplius) is orange in color. It has a single eye, six legs, and develops through instars (growth stages). Each instar ends with shedding the exoskeleton. The number of segments and appendages increases as Triops grow, and they slowly change to greyish brown. In approximately eight days, they reach maturity and lay eggs. Adult Triops die as the pools dry up. Triops generally live for about 20‚Äì90 days if the pool does not dry up. Ecology Red variant of Triops longicaudatus raised in captivity. T. longicaudatus is the most widespread notostracan species, and may be found in western North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, and several Pacific Islands. It is most active at a temperature of approximately , and is usually found scratching the mud at the bottom of pools, searching for benthic food. Triops collect food particles by straining the water with hairs on their limbs. Loose food particles are collected in a groove running down the underside of the body lengthwise, and held together by a sticky secretion until they are swallowed by their very small (2 mm wide) mouth. The tiny mouth is deep in its underbelly, and while the animal is capable of breaking up plant roots or dead fish, it is incapable of chasing down and eating prey larger than it is. =Diet= A Triops eating its companion Tadpole shrimps are omnivorous and may eat algae, insects, and other organic debris; they are known to chase very small fry, tadpoles, and oligochaete worms. In general, they eat anything organic that is smaller than they are, which even may include their siblings (they are cannibalistic). In turn, Triops longicaudatus are eaten by frogs and birds. =Interaction with humans= Adult 2.5 cm pet Triops in aquarium The species is considered a human ally against the West Nile virus, as the individuals consume Culex mosquito larvae. They also are used as a biological agent in Japan, eating weeds in rice paddies. In Wyoming, the presence of Triops longicaudatus usually indicates a good chance of the hatching of spadefoot frogs. Dried eggs of Triops longicaudatus are sold in kits to be raised as aquarium pets, sold under the name of \\"aquasaurs\\", \\"trigons\\" or \\"triops\\". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops. Distribution Though they make fine captive tank mates, Triops longicaudatus red and Triops cancriformis are not likely to be found together in the wild, nor to feed on carrots. Marimo moss balls are also unlikely companions. Triops longicaudatus is widespread in North America. In Canada, it is found only in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. It is widespread throughout the contiguous United States, Mexico, and Hawaii, but not Alaska. Tadpole shrimps may be found in parts of South America, in (Argentina and Gal√°pagos Islands), the West Indies, and the Pacific Islands, including Japan and New Caledonia.

The head office was first established at the prefecture of Xi, now known as Turpan, but was later shifted to Qiuci (Kucha) and situated there for most of the period. The Four Garrisons of Anxi in Kucha, Khotan, Kashgar, and Karashahr were installed between 648 and 658 as garrisons under the western protectorate. In 659 Soghd, Ferghana, Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Herat, Kashmir, the Pamirs, Tokharistan, and Kabul all submitted to the protectorate under Emperor Gaozong of Tang. After the An Lushan Rebellion the office of Protector General was given to Guo Xin who defended the area and the four garrisons even after communication had been cut off from Chang'an by the Tibetan Empire. The last five years of the protectorate are regarded as an uncertain period in its history, but most sources agree that the last vestiges of the protectorate and its garrisons were defeated by Tibetan forces by the year 790, ending nearly 150 years of Tang influence in central Asia. History Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty. The Protectorate General to Pacify the West is marked as Anxi (ÂÆâË•øÈÉΩÊä§Â∫ú). Tang dynasty administrative divisions in 742 CE Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xiyu states Historical cities of the Tarim Basin Kizil Caves = 7th century = The Western Regions during the Tang era were known as Qixi (Á£ßË•ø). Qi refers to the Gobi Desert while Xi refers to the west. In 632 the oasis kingdoms of Khotan (Yutian) and Shule (Kashgar) submitted to the Tang dynasty as vassals. In 635 Yarkand (Shache) submitted to the Tang dynasty. On 19 September 640 Hou Junji of Tang conquered Gaochang and set up Xi Prefecture (Ë•øÂ∑û) in its place. Xi Prefecture became the seat of the Anxi Protectorate on 11 October. Qiao Shiwang became the first protector general of the Anxi and served from 640‚Äì642. Guo Xiaoke received the next post and served from 640‚Äì648. By 644 Karasahr was also conquered, and was known to the Chinese as Yanqi. Aksu (Gumo) was garrisoned by Tang troops. In 648, the Tang conquered Kucha, known to the Chinese as Qiuci, and made it the new seat of Anxi under the governance of Chai Zhewei from 649‚Äì651. By 650 the entire Western Region had submitted to Tang authority. In 651 the seat was moved back to Xi Prefecture where it remained under the governance of Qu Zhizhan from 651‚Äì658. In 656 the Tibetan Empire attacked Lesser Bol√º in Gilgit southwest of the protectorate. In 658 the seat was moved back to Qiuci after Su Dingfang defeated the Western Turkic Khaganate. Its title was changed to \\"Grand Protectorate\\" and granted governorship of former Western Turkic territories, which were further separated into the Mengchi and Kunling protectorates. In 660 the Tibetan Empire and their Turkic allies attacked Shule. The Tibetan Empire also attacked Wakhan to the protectorate's southwest. When the Tang general boasted of the size of his army, Gar Tongtsen Yulsung's son responded in the following manner: In 663 the Tibetan Empire conquered Tuyuhun southeast of the protectorate. They also attacked Yutian but were repelled. In 665 the Tibetan Empire and Turkic allies attacked Yutian. The conflict between the Tang and Tibetans was the primary context under which the story of a Khotanese princess striving to rescue Khotan from destruction was formulated. One passage of the story in prayer form reads: In 670 the Tibetan Empire routed a Tang army at the Battle of Dafei River and attacked Gumo as well as captured Qiuci. The protectorate's seat was moved to Suyab, known as Suiye to the Chinese, in modern Kyrgyzstan. In 673 the Tang consolidated control over the Wuduolu Turks living in the area that came to be known as Dzungaria. The Tang also captured Qiuci and established control over the Western Regions in the same year. In 677 the Tibetan Empire captured Qiuci. In the same year Ashina Duzhi, previously a Tang general tasked with controlling the Wuduolu Turks, rebelled and declared himself Onoq Khagan, ruler of all Turks. In 679 the Tang general, Pei Xingjian, defeated Ashina Duzhi as well as the Tibetans and established control over the Western Regions. In 686 Tang troops withdrew from the Four Garrisons after elements within the court argued for the decrease of military expenditures. In 687 the Tibetan Empire established control over the Western Regions. In 690 the Tibetan Empire defeated a Tang army at Issyk-Kul In 692 Tang troops under Wang Xiaojie pacified the Western Regions and established the Anxi Protectorate at Qiuci, where it would remain until the protectorate's demise around 790. The importance of the Western Regions was well understood by the Tang court at this point. Its strategic significance is summarized by Cui Rong, an Imperial Diarist of the court: In 694 the Tibetan Empire attacked the Stone City (Charklik). =8th century= Hephthalite envoys 6th century AD. Tributary envoys from Qiemo, 6-7th centuries AD. In 702 Wu Zetian set up the Beiting Protectorate in Ting Prefecture (Jimsar County) and granted it governorship over Yi Prefecture (Hami) and Xi Prefecture. In 708 the Turgesh attacked Qiuci. In 710 the Tibetan Empire conquered Lesser Bol√º. Arab sources claim Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. In 715 the Tibetan Empire attacked Fergana, a Tang vassal. In 717 the Tibetan Empire attacked Gumo and the Stone City. The Arab Umayyad Caliphate in 715 AD desposed Ikhshid, the king the Fergana Valley, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate) and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne.Bai, Shouyi et al. (2003). A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol.2). Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company. . pp. 235‚Äì236. General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab- Tibetan attack in the Battle of Aksu (717). The attack on Aksu was joined by Turgesh Khan Suluk. Both Uch Turfan and Aksu were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717. Qarluqs serving under Chinese command, under Arsila Xian, a Western Turkic Qaghan serving under the Chinese Assistant Grand Protector General Tang Jiahui defeated the attack. Al- Yashkuri, the Arab commander and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated. In 719 the Turgesh captured Suiye. In 720 the Tibetan Empire seized the Stone City. In the same year Tang bestowed titles upon the kings of Khuttal, Chitral, and Oddiyana In 722 Tang restored the king of Lesser Bol√º to his throne. In 725 the king of Khotan (Yutian) rebelled but was immediately replaced with a Tang puppet by protectorate forces. In 726 the Turgesh attempted to engage in horse trade at Qiuci without prior authorization. The Turgesh Khagan Suluk used his marital relation with Princess Jiaohe to issue a decree ordering the Protector-General to engage in trade. However Princess Jiaohe was actually the daughter of Ashina Huaidao, and the Protector-General retorted: \\"How can an Ashina woman proclaim a decree to me, a military commissioner?!\\" In response Suluk attacked Qiuci. In 727 and 728 the Tibetan Empire attacked Qiuci. In 737 the Tibetan Empire conquered Lesser Bol√º. In 741 the Tibetan Empire sacked the Stone City. In 745 the Tang general Huangfu Weiming attacked the Stone City but suffered a major defeat. According to Huangfu, the Stone City was one of the most heavily defended bastions of the Tibetan Empire: In 747 the Tang general Gao Xianzhi captured Lesser Bol√º. In 748 the Tang recaptured Suiye and destroyed it. In 749 Tang recovered the Stone City. In 750 the Tang intervened in a dispute between their vassal Fergana and the neighboring kingdom of Chach, located in modern Tashkent. The kingdom of Chach was sacked and their king was taken back to Chang'an, where he was executed. In the same year Tang also defeated Qieshi in Chitral and the Turgesh. In 751 Tang forces suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Talas against Abbasid and Karluk forces. Although the Battle of Talas saw the limit of Tang expansion to the west, the importance of the defeat at the Battle of Talas has sometimes been exaggerated. Although the Tang army was defeated, the Arabs did not extend their influence into Xinjiang, and the Karluks remained amiable to the Tang. Some Karluks converted to Islam, but the vast majority did not until the mid 10th century under Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan of the Kara- Khanid Khanate. The long-term strategic importance of Talas was overshadowed later on by the An Lushan Rebellion, which devastated the Tang homeland. It is now understood as the primary cause for the Tang retreat from Central Asia. In 754 Tang forces defeated Baltistan (Greater Bol√º) and Tibetan forces. In 755 the An Lushan Rebellion occurred and the Tang dynasty withdrew 200,000 soldiers from the Western Regions to protect the capital. In 763 the Tibetan Empire conquered Yanqi. In the same year the Tang capital was briefly taken by the Tibetans before they were forced to retreat. In 764 the Tibetan Empire invaded the Hexi Corridor and conquered Liang Prefecture, cutting off the Anxi and Beiting protectorates from the Tang dynasty. However Anxi and Beiting were left relatively unmolested under the leadership of Guo Xin and Li Yuanzhong. In 780 Guo Xin and Li Yuanzhong were officially made protectorate generals after sending secret messages to Emperor Dezong of Tang. In 787 the Tibetan Empire conquered Qiuci. In 789 the monk Wukong passed through Shule, Yutian, Gumo, Qiuci, Yanqi, and Ting Prefecture and found that they all had Chinese commanders and were free from Tibetan or Uyghur control. This contradicts the previous conquests of Yanqi and Qiuci by the Tibetan Empire in 763 and 787, assertions made by Yuri Bregel in his An Historical Atlas of Central Asia. In 792 the Tibetan Empire conquered Yutian. It is unclear what happened to Shule (Kashgar), Shache (Yarkand), or Gumo (Aksu). According to O. Pritsak, Kashgar came under Karluk domination around this time, but this is disputed by Christopher I. Beckwith. Post-Tibetan domination Qocho Kingdom and Guiyi Circuit post-Tibetan Empire. Of the four garrisons that made up the defunct Anxi Protectorate, all eventually ended up freeing themselves or coming under the dominion of other powers by the mid-9th century. Karasahr and Kucha were occupied by the Kingdom of Qocho in 843. Kashgar came under the dominion of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. The earliest approximate date of around the late 8th or early 9th century is disputed, but it was likely before 980. Khotan regained its independence in 851. By 1006 it was also conquered by the Kara- Khanid Khanate.

A painting of Yel√º Bei, eldest son of Abaoji, the founder of the Liao dynasty. =Physical remains= In Xinjiang and the Chu valley in Central Asia, Tang era Chinese coins continued to be copied and minted after the Chinese left the area. Coins with both Chinese and Karoshthi inscriptions have been found in the southern Tarim Basin. =Linguistic influence= The military dominance of the Tang in Central Asia has been used as an explanation for the Turkic word for China, \\"Tamghaj\\", possibly derived from the \\"House of Tang\\" (Tangjia) instead of Tabgatch. =Cultural influence= Chinese arts and crafts such as the sancai \\"three color\\" glaze left a long lasting impression in Central Asia and Western Eurasia. In the Persian epic Shahnameh the Chin and Turkestan are regarded as the same. The Khan of Turkestan is called the Khan of Chin. Aladdin, an Arabic Islamic story which is set in China, may have been referring to Central Asia. =Political influence= Steppe empires often utilized the prestige of the Tang by connecting themselves to the defunct dynasty. The Qara Khitan khans used the title of \\"Chinese emperor\\" while the Khara-Khanid khans called themselves Tabgach. Tabgach Khan, or \\"Khan of China\\" was a common appellation among Khara-Khanid rulers. Persian, Arab and other western Asian writers came to call China by the name \\"Tamghaj\\". In 1124 the westward migration of the Khitans under Yel√º Dashi also consisted of a large population of Han Chinese, Balhae, Jurchen, Mongols, Khitan, in addition to the Xiao consort clan and the Yel√º royal family In the 12th century, the Qara Khitai defeated the Kara- Khanid Khanate and conquered their territory in Central Asia. The Khitan rulers, called \\"the Chinese\\" by Muslims, governed using Chinese as their official language as well as the Chinese style of imperial government. The effect of their administration was seen with respect and esteem due in part to China's status in Central Asia at the time.Biran 2012, p. 90. The Chinese characteristics appealed to the Muslim Central Asians and helped validate Qara Khitai rule. Han Chinese population among them was comparatively small so it is unlikely that the Chinese characteristics were kept to appease them. Later the Mongols moved more Chinese into Beshbalik, Almaliq and Samarqand in Central Asia to work as artisans and farmers. The \\"image of China\\" played a key role in legitimizing the Khitan rule to the Central Asian Muslims. Prior to the Mongol invasions, the perception of China among Central Asian Muslims was an extremely civilized society, known for its unique script, its expert artisans, justice and religious tolerance. The Chinese, Turk, Arab, Byzantine, and Indian rulers were known as the world's \\"five great kings\\". The historical memory of Tang China was powerful enough that anachronistic expressions appeared in Muslim writings long after the end of the Tang. China was known as chƒ´n (⁄ÜŸäŸÜ) in Persian and as ·π£ƒ´n (ÿµŸäŸÜ) in Arabic while the Tang dynasty capital Changan was known as ·∏§umdƒÅn (ÿÆŸèŸÖÿØÿßŸÜ). Some Muslim writers like Marwazƒ´, Mahmud KashghƒÅrƒ´ and Kashgari viewed Kashgar as part of China. ·π¢ƒ´n [i.e., China] is originally three fold; Upper, in the east which is called TawjƒÅch; middle which is KhitƒÅy, lower which is BarkhƒÅn in the vicinity of Kashgar. But know TawjƒÅch is known as Ma·π£ƒ´n and Khitai as ·π¢ƒ´n\\" China was called after the Tuoba rulers of the Northern Wei by the Turks, pronounced by them as TamghƒÅj, TabghƒÅj, TafghƒÅj or TawjƒÅch. India introduced the name Maha Chin (greater China) which influenced the two different names for China in Persian as chƒ´n and mƒÅchƒ´n (⁄ÜŸäŸÜ ŸÖÿß⁄ÜŸäŸÜ) and Arabic ·π£ƒ´n and mƒÅ·π£ƒ´n (ÿµŸäŸÜ ŸÖÿßÿµŸäŸÜ), Southern China at Canton was known as Chin while Northern China's Chang'an was known as Machin, but the definition switched and the south was referred to as Machin and the north as Chin after the Tang dynasty. As a result of Tang China's control over Kashgar, some KashghƒÅrƒ´ placed Kashgar within the definition of China, ·π¢ƒ´n, whose emperor was titled as TafghƒÅj or TamghƒÅj, Yugur (yellow Uighurs or Western Yugur) and Khitai or Qitai were all classified as \\"China\\" by Marwazƒ´ while he wrote that ·π¢ƒ´nwas was bordered by placed SNQU and Ma·π£ƒ´n. Machin, Mahachin, Chin, and Sin were all names of China.Cordier, Henri. \\"China.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 Sept. 2015 . According to Fakhr al-Dƒ´n MubƒÅrak ShƒÅh, \\"Turkestan\\", Balasagun, and Kashghar were identified with where Chƒ´n (China) was located. Taklamakan Desert Marwazƒ´ considered Transoxania to be a former part of China, retaining the legacy of Tang Chinese rule over Transoxania in Muslim writings, In ancient times all the districts of Transoxania had belonged to the kingdom of China [·π¢ƒ´n], with the district of Samarqand as its centre. When Islam appeared and God delivered the said district to the Muslims, the Chinese migrated to their [original] centers, but there remained in Samarqand, as a vestige of them, the art of making paper of high quality. And when they migrated to Eastern parts their lands became disjoined and their provinces divided, and there was a king in China and a king in Qitai and a king in Yugur. Some Muslim writers considered the Qara Khitai, the Ganzhou Uighur Kingdom and Kashgar as all parts of \\"China\\". After Yusuf Qadir Khan's conquest of new land in Altishahr towards the east, he adopted the title \\"King of the East and China\\". =Qocho= The Tang era of Gaochang, later Qocho and Turpan, left a lasting legacy upon the Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho. Tang names appear on more than 50 Buddhist temples. Emperor Taizong's edicts were stored in the \\"Imperial Writings Tower\\" and Chinese dictionaries like the Jingyun, Yuian, Tang yun, and da zang jing (Buddhist scriptures) were also stored inside the Buddhist temples. Persian monks also maintained a Manichaean temple in the Qocho. The Persian Hudud al-'Alam referred to Qocho as the \\"Chinese town\\". The Turpan Buddhist Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho continued to produce the Chinese Qieyun rime dictionary and developed their own pronunciations of Chinese characters, left over from the Tang influence over the area. In Central Asia the Uyghurs viewed the Chinese script as \\"very prestigious\\" so when they developed the Old Uyghur alphabet, based on the Syriac script, they deliberately wrote it vertically like with Chinese writing.

A view of Salladasburg, Lycoming County A view of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley from Bald Eagle Mountain in Lycoming County. Cogan House Covered Bridge over Larrys Creek in Cogan House Township This article details a history of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Early inhabitants The first recorded inhabitants of Lycoming County were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant 'people of the muddy river' in Lenape. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee phratry of the Lenni Lenape (or Delaware), and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the Iroquois. =Otstonwakin= Madame Montour's village of Otstonwakin or Ostuagy was an important location during the settlement of what is now Lycoming County. Her village at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River was a stopping point for the Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout the wilderness of Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Zinzendorf, a missionary being guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Shikellamy, came to Ostuagy in 1742. Madame Montour was known to be a friend of the British. She welcomed the white men who were beginning to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. She also had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes as they were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion. Madame Montour remained loyal to the British despite several attempts by the French to bring her over to their side. Historians note that this was remarkable considering the British colonial government sometimes went as long as a year without paying her for her services. Madame Montour was the mother of three children. A son, Louis, served as a translator during the French and Indian War. He was killed during the war. Her daughter, Margaret, later to be known as \\"French Margaret\\" went on to become the leader of \\"French Margaret's Town\\" an Indian settlement at the mouth of Lycoming Creek just a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Her son, Andrew, took over leadership of Otstonwakin upon her death in the late 1740s. Andrew inherited his mother's gift for languages. He spoke French, English, Lenape, Shawnee, and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as a translator for both settlers and local tribes. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour, he wrote that Montour looked \\"decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would have thought he was one.\\" He also served as a translator with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He was later appointed as a captain in George Washington's army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. Andrew Montour left Montoursville at some point and moved to Juniata County before finally settling on Muntour's Island in the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. =The Big Runaway= In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. =Fair Play Men= The site of the Tiadaghton Elm and the Fair Play Men's Declaration of Independence today. The elm is no longer standing, but Pine Creek is still visible in the background. The Fair Play Men were illegal settlers (squatters) who established their own system of self-rule from 1773 to 1785 in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley of Pennsylvania in what is now the United States. Because they settled in territory claimed by Native Americans, they had no recourse to the Pennsylvania colonial government. Accordingly, they established what was known as the \\"Fair Play System,\\" with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own declaration of independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the Tiadaghton Elm on the banks of Pine Creek. =Fort Antes= Fort Antes was a stockade surrounding the home of Colonel John Henry Antes, built circa 1778 in Revolutionary Pennsylvania in the United States. The fort was built under the direction of Colonel Antes, who was a member of the Pennsylvania militia. It was on the east side of Antes Creek, overlooking and on the left bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, on a plateau in Nippenose Township south of modern-day Jersey Shore in western Lycoming County. The local militia held the fort for a short period of time, until Colonel Samuel Hunter ordered them to abandon Fort Antes during the Big Runaway. Despite being abandoned and attempts by the attacking British forces to burn it down, Fort Antes was one of only two structures in the valley to survive the Big Runaway. =Lycoming Creek and the Sheshequin Path= Lycoming Creek and the Sheshequin Path played an important role in the early history of Lycoming County. The path was a major Native American trail in that ran between two Native American villages: French Margaret's Town on the West Branch Susquehanna River (part of modern-day Williamsport in Lycoming County) and Sheshequin on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River (modern day Ulster Township, in Bradford County). The path ran north and east along Lycoming Creek in Lycoming County and followed much of Towanda Creek in Bradford County. It was a shortcut between the two main branches of the Susquehanna River and was used by early settlers as well as Native Americans. Lycoming Creek, which begins in McNett Township also served as a highway of sorts during the colonial era of Pennsylvania's history. The stream was used by early explorers and the Native Americans in the area as a means of travel. They were able to float their canoes down the creek and into the West Branch Susquehanna River. This mode of transportation was considerably faster than walking the path. Conrad Weiser guided Moravian missionaries along the creek and path to reach Onondaga, the capital of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1737. Raiding parties of Indian warriors used the creek and path in 1770 when conducting attacks on the West Branch Susquehanna Valley strongholds of Fort Muncy and Fort Freeland. Colonel Thomas Hartley led the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment up the Sheshequin Path during the American Revolution. Hartley's expedition in 1778 preceded the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Both Hartley and Sullivan were instrumental in claiming the frontier of Pennsylvania and New York for the forces of the Continental Army. As Hartley and his men passed through Lewis Township, the Sheshequin path was widened. The widening of the path helped to open this area to settlement in the years following the Revolution. Formation of the county Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County on April 13, 1795. At the time it was formed, the county was much larger than it is today. It took up most of the land that is now north central Pennsylvania. The following counties have been formed from land that was once part of Lycoming County: Armstrong, Bradford, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Indiana, Jefferson, McKean, Potter, Sullivan, Tioga, Venango, Warren, Forest, Elk, and Cameron. Lycoming County was originally named Jefferson County in honor of Thomas Jefferson. This name proved to be unsatisfactory. The name change went through several steps. First a change to Lycoming County was rejected, next the name Susquehanna County was struck down as was Muncy County, before the legislature revisited and settled on Lycoming County for Lycoming Creek the stream that was the center of the pre-Revolutionary border dispute. County firsts 1615 - The first European in Lycoming County was √âtienne Brul√©. He was a voyageur for New France. Brul√© descended the West Branch Susquehanna River and was held captive by a local Indian tribe near what is now Muncy before escaping and returning to Canada. 1761 - The first permanent homes were built in Muncy. Three log cabins were built by Bowyer Brooks, Robert Roberts, and James Alexander. 1772 - The first gristmill was built on Muncy Creek by John Alward. 1775 - The first public road was built along the West Branch Susquehanna River. The road followed Indian trails from Fort Augusta in what is now Sunbury to Bald Eagle Creek near modern-day Lock Haven. 1786 - The first church built in the county was Lycoming Presbyterian church, in what was known as Jaysburg and is now the Newberry section of Williamsport. 1792 - The first sawmill was built on Lycoming Creek by Roland Hall. 1795 - The first elections for Lycoming County government are held soon after the county was formed from Northumberland County. The elected officers were Samuel Stewart; the first sheriff and county commissioners were John Hanna, Thomas Forster, and James Crawford. Andrew Gregg was elected to represent Lycoming County in the United States Congress, William Hepburn was voted to the Pennsylvania State Senate, and Flavel Roan, Hugh White, and Robert Martin served as representatives in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. 1823 - The county government funded the construction of the first bridges over Loyalsock and Lycoming Creeks. 1839 - The first railroad was built. It connected Williamsport with Ralston in northern Lycoming County. The railroad followed Lycoming Creek. Founders The founders of Williamsport‚Äîand to an extent, Lycoming County‚Äîwere Michael Ross and William Hepburn. Both men played a great role in the formation of Lycoming County and the establishment of Williamsport as the county seat. Michael Ross was born in Scotland on July 12, 1759. He and his mother migrated across the Atlantic Ocean in 1772 and landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They became indentured servants to Samuel Wallis, known as the \\"Land King\\" of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Wallis had extensive holdings in Muncy Township. Wallis brought Michael Ross and his mother to Muncy Township, where Ross was trained as a surveyor's assistant. Michael Ross must have made a good impression upon Wallis, since Wallis gave Ross of land and a favorable letter of recommendation. Ross quickly became a successful surveyor and farmer. He was able to use his profits to purchase of land along the West Branch Susquehanna River, between Loyalsock and Lycoming Creeks. This land, originally called \\"Virginia,\\" was to in time become Williamsport, the county seat of Lycoming County. William Hepburn was in County Donegal, Ireland in 1753. He migrated to the Thirteen Colonies in 1773 or 1774. Hepburn lived in the Sunbury area for a short time before moving up the West Branch Susquehanna River to what is now Duboistown, where he worked for Andrew Culbertson in digging the race for Culberton's Mill. Hepburn also joined the local militia. During the American Revolution, the West Branch Valley came under attack from Loyalist and Indian forces. These attacks were known as the Big Runaway in 1778 and the later Little Runaway in 1779. Hepburn rose to the position of colonel and was the commanding officer at Fort Muncy, Samuel Wallis's fortified home in Muncy Township. Hepburn, reportedly, gave the orders to Robert Covenhoven and Rachel Silverthorn to spread the word of the impending attacks. Following the Big Runaway, Hepburn kept a permanent connection with the Covenhoven family by marrying Crecy Covenhoven, the sister of Robert. Hepburn also bought of land, to the west of Ross's holdings. His land, known as \\"Deer Park,\\" when combined with Ross's \\"Virginia,\\" would eventually become Williamsport. Selection of the county seat The selection of Williamsport as county seat was a major controversy in the early history of Lycoming County. It involved a bitter rivalry between an old frontier town and an upstart town that was built on a swamp. The first commissioners and officers of Lycoming County had their first offices and held their first court in Jaysburg (now part of the Newberry section of Williamsport). Jaysburg was on the western side of Lycoming Creek on a high piece of land. The land to the east of Lycoming Creek was known as Deer Park and was quite swampy. Jaysburg was at the time the only sizable village west of Muncy. Although Muncy was and still is in Lycoming County, it was not considered as an option for county seathood, possibly due to its proximity to the southern and eastern borders of the county. Jaysburg's buildings were sufficient to serve as the first courthouse and jail in the history of Lycoming County. It seemed to be the most logical place for establishing a county seat, and many of its residents were sure that their town would indeed be the county seat. This was not to be. The county seat was awarded to a new community across the creek and Jaysburg soon disappeared from the map; its land was absorbed by the new city of Williamsport. One of the first county judges, William Hepburn, owned the land on the opposite shore of Jaysburg that was known as Deer Park. Another land speculator, Michael Ross, owned of land in what is now the central part of Williamsport. Ross had laid out a town on his property, and a few homes were being built. Ross and Hepburn would team together to create Williamsport from land that was swampy and thought to be uninhabitable by the Susquehannocks who had originally inhabited the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Ross wanted to sell his properties and rightly believed that they would quickly sell if his town was made county seat. Hepburn, desiring political power, had little money by which to gain that power, but had a lot of land that could also be sold if Williamsport were to become the county seat. The citizens of Jaysburg saw the attempts by Hepburn and Ross as a threat and they fought back. They believed that Jaysburg was much better suited to be the seat of government. It was already well established and held the higher and drier land. They argued that Williamsport would be frequently flooded and that the swamps would carry deadly diseases. The Jaysburgers sought to prove their point by sending an affidavit to the state capital stating that the land was prone to flooding and thereby unsuitable to be the county seat. A resident of Northumberland wrote an affidavit that he had once \\"tied up\\" his boat on a point of land on what is now East Third and State Streets in downtown Williamsport. He accessed it by way of a \\"gut\\" or an arm of the river that backflowed into the land. The affidavit was the proof that the Jaysburg interests needed to discredit Williamsport as a possible location for the county seat. Hepburn and Ross heard of this potentially financially devastating document and sought to have it destroyed before it reached the state government. It is supposed that men working for Hepburn and Ross met up with the messenger bearing the affidavit at the Russell Inn on the corner of East Third and Mulberry Streets in Williamsport and got him intoxicated. Then they are said to have cut open his saddle bags and made off with the documents. The state commissioners by this time had begun to grow very weary of the rivalry between Jaysburg and Williamsport. They began to consider a third possibility for the county seat: a new village that was farther up the West Branch Susquehanna River, west of the mouth of Pine Creek in what is now Clinton County. The town of Dunnsburg even went so far as to offer, free of charge, lots on which to build the buildings that would be required by the county government. It appeared as if the state commissioners would choose neither Williamsport nor Jaysburg, instead choosing the outpost of Dunnsburg. This is when Judge Hepburn and Michael Ross set out their plan that ultimately led toward Williamsport being named the county seat. Hepburn convinced Ross to offer lots of his property to the state commissioners for the building of a county courthouse and jail. This he believed would induce the state commissioners to give the seathood to Williamsport. Ross is stated to have had little interest in politics, but being a good businessman was interested in selling his land. Ross agreed to Hepburn's suggestion and the lots were offered to the state commission. The state commission accepted the lots, and Williamsport was finally named the county seat of Lycoming County. When Williamsport was established as the county seat it was little more than a few cabins spread here and there in the aforementioned swampy areas. Jaysburg served as the de facto county seat for several years after Williamsport was \\"officially\\" named the seat of government for Lycoming County. This delay became a cause for concern to the residents of county and the state government in Philadelphia. The county commissioners delayed in constructing a courthouse and jail in Williamsport until 1799. The jail was finally opened in 1801. Next the commissioners approved the construction of the county courthouse in Williamsport. Construction also began in 1800 and work was completed in late 1804, nearly ten years after Williamsport was named the county seat. Susquehanna Boom boom cribs in the West Branch Susquehanna River are all that is left of the Susquehanna Boom today The Susquehanna Boom was a system of cribs in the West Branch Susquehanna River designed to hold timber in the river until it could be processed at one of the nearly sixty sawmills along the West Branch Susquehanna River between Lycoming and Loyalsock Creeks in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The boom was constructed in 1846 under the supervision of James H. Perkins. A boom is a chain or line of connected floating timbers extended across a river, lake, or harbor (as to obstruct passage or catch floating objects). The Susquehanna Boom extended seven miles (11 km) upstream from Duboistown to the village of Linden in Woodward Township. The boom was constructed by creating a series of man-made islands known as \\"cribs.\\" These cribs, built of local mountain stone and sunken timber, were stretched diagonally across the river, beginning on the south side near Duboistown and ending on the north side near Linden. The boom was made of 352 separate cribs that were high. The boom was opened and closed at the upper end by a device known as a \\"sheer boom.\\" It was long and was controlled with a hand-powered windlass. The sheer boom gathered the logs into the main boom that was capable of holding up to 300 million board feet (700,000 m3) of logs. The lower end of the boom was where the logs were sorted. The mills in Williamsport, South Williamsport, and Duboistown each had their own distinctive brand burnt into the logs. The men working at the end of the boom would sort the logs according to their corresponding brand and float them into the correct holding pond along the bank of the river. During the height of the lumber industry in Lycoming County, 1861‚Äì1891, the various mills produced 5.5 billion board feet (13 million m3) of lumber. Williamsport became one of the most prosperous cities in Pennsylvania and in the United States. Men like James H. Perkins, Peter Herdic, and Mahlon Fisher became millionaires, while many of the men who actually worked in the river struggled to survive on the wages paid to them by the lumber barons. Abolition riot of 1842 The Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842 occurred in April 1842 in Muncy. The riot led to the conviction and ultimate pardoning of 13 men who rioted at a schoolhouse where a now-unknown abolitionist speaker, who had been invited by some local Quakers, spoke against slavery. One of the common misconceptions about United States history prior to the Civil War is that all the citizens of the northern states were against slavery. In fact, many Northerners were all for slavery, especially in states closer to the Confederacy like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware. There were more than a few abolitionists in Pennsylvania: Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, was one of the most prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was like most Quakers a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery. Hawley invited the now-unknown speaker to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker arrived in April 1842. His arrival and coinciding speech set off a tremendous riot that led to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter. During the course of the speech, eighteen men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows. Enos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley's home at the corner of High and Main Streets. They continued the assault on Hawley's home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters. The rioters were indicted in September and went to trial in October; thirteen of the eighteen rioters were found guilty as charged. The jury's deliberation was quite a long process. Abraham Updegraff was a member of the jury who was the driving force that led to the conviction of the rioters. Updegraff, an ardent abolitionist who was a vital member of the Underground Railroad in Lycoming County, was able to convince his peers that the rioters deserved to be punished. The first jury vote was 11 to 1 in favor of acquittal, with Upedgraff being the lone dissenter. Updegraff argued that \\"we have been sworn to try this case according to the law and the evidence presented and that if no contradictory evidence offered by the defendants than we could do nothing more than to convict them.\\" He was able to make his argument in German, which was the native tongue of three other jurors. The second vote was 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal. A third vote brought about the conviction of thirteen of the eighteen men charged in the Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842. This conviction was essentially overturned by Governor David R. Porter when he pardoned the rioters several days later. Governor Porter's statement of pardon said, \\"It is represented to me by highly respected citizens of Lycoming County, that this prosecution was instituted more with a view to the accomplishment of political ends than to serve the cause of law and order.\\" Porter's pardon message placed the blame for the riot on the abolitionist speaker. Porter stated that the speech was \\"notoriously offensive to the minds of those to whom they were addressed and were calculated to bring about a breach of the peace.\\" This pardon led to Governor Porter being given the less than flattering nickname of the \\"Previous Pardonin Porter.\\" Historians believe that Porter pardoned the rioters under political pressure that was rampant, in the years prior to the Civil War, regarding the issue of slavery. The Underground Railroad The Freedom Road Cemetery Historical Marker Daniel Hughes was a conductor in the Underground Railroad based in Loyalsock Township and Williamsport. He was the owner of a barge on the Pennsylvania Canal and transported lumber from Williamsport on the West Branch Susquehanna River to Havre de Grace, Maryland. Hughes hid runaway slaves in the hold of his barge on his return trip up the Susquehanna River to Lycoming County, where he provided shelter on his property near the Loyalsock Township border with Williamsport before moving further north to eventual freedom in Canada. Hughes's home was located in a hollow or small valley in the mountains just north of Williamsport. This hollow is now known as Freedom Road, having previously been called Nigger Hollow. In response to the actions of concerned African-American citizens of Williamsport, the pejorative name was formally changed by the Williamsport City Council in 1936. The American Civil War Soon after the beginning of the American Civil War, United States President Abraham Lincoln called for the northern states to muster 75,000 soldiers. Patriotic fever swept through Lycoming County as the people of the north anticipated what they believed would be a rapid defeat of the rebellious Confederate States of America. Twelve days after Fort Sumter was fired upon, Lycoming County was able to produce three companies of soldiers that totaled 244 men. The three companies departed from the railroad station near the corner of what is now Pine Street and Little League Boulevard. On that day all businesses in Williamsport closed until the trains pulled away. Two civic bands played at the send-off. The train left the station at 8:30 amid loud cheers and celebration. The citizens of Lycoming County continued to support the war in various ways as numerous trains passed through Williamsport from points north and west carrying new troops to the battles in the south. Ladies' groups set up tables at the Northern Central Railway depot. Here they were able to feed and encourage the passing soldiers. The tables were heaped with various foods and drinks including cold meat, bread, fresh vegetables, buttermilk, lager beer, and a variety of distilled spirits. Ladies Aid Societies banded together to roll bandages and knit socks, trousers, and shirts for the soldiers. The exact numbers of soldiers from Lycoming County to serve during the Civil War is unknown. What is known is that 2,481 men from Lycoming County served in the war from May 12, 1863 until April 14, 1865. This count was conducted by the local Congressional District. The landlords and employers of Lycoming County routinely froze rent payments and held the jobs of the departed soldiers. The Lycoming Gazette reported, \\"Whenever a man quits an employment to go into his country's service his employer will religiously hold the same place open for him until he comes home again.\\" City history =Williamsport= Williamsport is the only city in Lycoming County. It was incorporated as a borough on March 1, 1806, and as a city on January 15, 1866. The city is the original home of Little League Baseball, founded in 1939 as a three-team league. In the late 19th century, when Williamsport was known as \\"The Lumber Capital of the World\\" because of its thriving lumber industry, it also was the birthplace of the national newspaper Grit in 1882. Williamsport once had more millionaires per capita than anywhere in the world. The area's local high school, the Williamsport Area High School, uses the Millionaires as its mascot. Borough histories =Duboistown= Duboistown (pronounced 'doo-BOYS town') is named for its founders John and Mathias DuBois, who bought of land between 1852 and 1857. The DuBois brothers divided their land into parcels and established the village that bears their name. John DuBois left the West Branch Susquehanna Valley before Duboistown was established as a borough. He sold his business interests and moved west to Clearfield County. He became quite wealthy and the city of DuBois was named in his honor. The town built by the DuBois brothers is by no means the beginning of the history of Duboistown. It is situated at the mouth of Mosquito Run on the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. A tribe of Susquehannock Indians had what appears to have been a fairly major settlement at the mouth of the creek. The early European settlers found the remains of an Indian village there. Arhaeologic evidence of earthenware, soapstone ware, pestles, hatchets, ornaments, and charms were found on the land that is across the river from Lycoming Creek and nearby where the Sheshequin Path crossed the river. The land on which Duboistown is located was first surveyed in 1769. At the time it was known as \\"Walnut Bottom\\" for the vast stands of black walnut that covered the alluvial plain on which the borough now stands. Samuel Boone, cousin of Daniel Boone held the first warrant for land at Walnut Bottom. Andrew Culbertson was one of the first settlers to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson's Path. He built a sawmill on the mouth of the creek so after moving to the area and there he lived for several years. Culbertson was forced to flee the area during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a press that extracted nut and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible by canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertonson's Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain to be ground into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson's Mill and tavern are long gone, and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods. =Hughesville= Hughesville is named for Jeptha Hughes, who purchased land from John Heap in 1816 and laid out the town of Hughesburg. Hughes sold the entire plot in 1820 to Daniel Harrold. The town grew slowly around a gristmill that was constructed by Jacob Clayton. A tavern was built in 1820 and a general store was opened ten years later in 1830. The first doctor in Hughesville, John W. Peale, arrived in 1828. Hughesville was incorporated as a borough on April 23, 1852. The first dentist opened an office in 1853 and the first lawyer settled in Hughesville in 1875. Early industries in Hughesville were built to serve the farmers and citizens of eastern Lycoming County. They included a chair factory opened in 1829, a wagon shop in 1830, several distilleries, a sawmill and planing mill, and a furniture factory. Electricity was introduced to Hughesville in 1891 along with running water. =Jersey Shore= A view of historic Jersey Shore Jersey Shore was incorporated as a borough on March 15, 1826. The history of Jersey Shore begins about fifty years before it was incorporated and on the opposite bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River in what is now Nippenose Township. Colonel John Henry Antes arrived in 1772 and established a homestead along the banks of Antes Creek. Antes also built a gristmill and his fortified home, Fort Antes, provided a safe haven for the early settlers against raids conducted by Loyalist and Indian forces during the American Revolution. Settlers who had sought refuge at Fort Antes and had returned to the right bank of the West Branch to milk their cows were among the first killed when Fort Antes was attacked just prior to the Big Runaway. These pioneers on the north side of the river were counted among the Fair Play Men a group of squatters who lived outside the jurisdiction of the colonial and revolutionary governments of Pennsylvania. Many of the settlers did not return to the area until after Sullivan's Expedition had forced the Lenni Lenape and other Indians allied with the British further west. Jersey Shore was originally named Waynesburg by the two brothers, Reuben and Jeremiah Manning, who laid out the town circa 1785. Around the time that this was happening, a settlement arose on the eastern side of the West Branch Susquehanna River (Nippenose Township), opposite Waynesburg. A rivalry developed between the two settlements, and those on the eastern shore began referring to the settlement on the western shore as the \\"Jersey Shore,\\" because the Manning family had relocated from New Jersey. The nickname became so fixed that in 1826 the original name of Waynesburg was officially abandoned and changed to Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore's location on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream from the mouth of Pine Creek, made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the westernmost portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to the men and women passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel; no more, no less. If the competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price, and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin, who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal. The Reverend John Hays Grier arrived in Jersey Shore in 1814. He was a Presbyterian missionary who originally set out from his home of Doylestown Pennsylvania with the intention of serving the pioneers of the west. He stopped one Sunday in Jersey Shore and for the most part never left. He built a strong congregation at Jersey Shore and another upstream on the West Branch in Lock Haven. Grier served the churches in Lock Haven and Jersey Shore for fourteen years before serving alone at the church in Jersey Shore for an additional twenty-three years. Rev. Grier was also elected sheriff of Lycoming County in 1822. Jersey Shore was once a major player in the railroad industry. The New York Central Railroad built a large rail car building operation within the boundaries of Jersey Shore in the late 19th century. What had formerly been a minor stop on the Pennsylvania Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed overnight into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of the average worker in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works manufacturers of railroad valves, Jersey Shore Steel, the Susquehanna Silk Mill, and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company. =Montgomery= Montgomery was incorporated as a borough by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 27, 1887 from part of Clinton Township. The history of the settlement of Montgomery begins in 1783, when John Lawson established a homestead there. Nicholas Shaffer built a gristmill in Montgomery in 1795. A sawmill and a wool carding mill were other early industries found on Black Hole Creek which flows through Montgomery. P. M. Barber was the first person to come to Montgomery and establish an industry that achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in 1859 and later a planing mill in 1869 on the site of the distillery. Barber, along with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler, had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops, which, starting in 1873 under the supervision of Levi Houston, built woodworking machinery that was sold to clients throughout the United States and Canada and as far away as Australia. Montgomery was previously known as Black Hole for the creek that flows through it; the post office was established in 1836 bearing that name. It was also known as Clinton Mills, again named for the post office. The name Montgomery stems from another name for the same post office, Montgomery Station. =Montoursville= The earliest history of Montoursville can be read at the \\"Ostuagy\\" section of this article or at Madame Montour. Montoursville was incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1850. The history of the borough begins about forty years prior to its formal incorporation. John Else migrated to the Montoursville area from Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1807 with his family when he was just ten years old. His father had a farm along Mill Creek in what is now Mill Creek Township. John Else worked to build the first permanent bridge over Loyalsock Creek in 1815. This was the first of many improvements that he helped build to establish Montoursville as a viable community in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Else also built many of the structures in Montoursville, including its first permanent home. John Burrows is recognized as the founder of Montoursville. He was born near Rahway, New Jersey. In his youth Burrows delivered mail on horseback, riding between New York and Philadelphia. He also served as a courier for General George Washington during the American Revolution for fourteen months. Following the war, Burrows migrated to Muncy and worked in the distilling business for several years. His work at the distilleries enabled him to build up the needed capital to make an investment in some land near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek, what is now Montoursville. Burrows also gained a measure of political clout in Lycoming County, serving first as a justice of the peace before being elected to the county commissioner's post in 1802, and later to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1808. He bought in 1812. Burrows divided his land into lots in 1820 and sold them for $50.00 each. The first buyers of lots in Montoursville divided themselves into two distinct ethnic groups. The Germans settled in the eastern end in a neighborhood that became known as Coffeetown, while the English settled in the western neighborhood, known as Teatown. In addition to selling the lots in Montoursville, Burrows operated a highly successful farm. His produce was sent by raft down the Susquehanna River and on to Baltimore, where he was able to turn a profit. Burrows used these profits to further his enterprise by building the first gristmill in the town. He continued to sell lots until the time of his death in 1837. Nathaniel Burrows, son of John Burrows, was another successful businessman in Montoursville's early days. He opened the first general store in the town. He also received the contract for construction of the Pennsylvania Canal in this section of Lycoming County. Nathaniel Burrows was able to influence the construction of the canal so that it ran farther away from the river than usual, and thereby closer to the town and the businesses of Nathaniel Burrows. Indian Park is located on the northern side of Montoursville and is parallel to Interstate 180/U.S. Route 220. It serves as a large recreational park with several miles of hiking and biking trails, numerous softball fields, picnic areas, and pavilions and fishing ponds. Indian Park was a trolley park during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Visitors from Williamsport would board the trolley in downtown Williamsport and ride to Indian Park to spend a day of recreation along the banks of Loyalsock Creek. The park was home to one of the largest and longest roller coasters on the East Coast of the United States. The park also featured over of ponds, a theatre, and a merry-go-round. The amusement park was ultimately closed in 1924, due in large part to the rising and continued cost of reconstructing the park following the almost-yearly floods on Loyalsock Creek. The Montoursville Flight 800 Memorial Montoursville became famous worldwide when, on July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 exploded off East Moriches, New York, with the loss of 230 lives. On board were sixteen students from Montoursville High School and their five adult chaperones who were on a class trip to France as part of a student exchange program. Condolences came from as far away as Japan, Australia, and Belgium. Tom Ridge, United States Secretary of Homeland Security (2003‚Äì2005), was governor of Pennsylvania at the time of the crash, and attended a vigil at the school with his wife. Ridge and New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani would also attend a memorial service honoring the victims. Among those who sent condolences were President Bill Clinton, the U.S. softball team at the Atlanta Olympics, and Francois Bujon de l'Estaing, French ambassador to the United States (1995‚Äì2002). A memorial is located on the grounds of Montoursville High School. It is a statue of an angel (sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina) on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief history. The memorial is in a circular grove of 21 trees (one for each victim). The angel was chosen because a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, was thought by many onlookers to resemble an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet. =Muncy= About 1787, four brothers Silas, William, Benjamin, and Isaac McCarty, arrived in the Muncy area from Bucks County. They were of Quaker extraction. William and Benjamin bought known as the \\"John Brady farm\\" and divided it, William taking the portion between what is now West Water Street and Muncy Creek, and Benjamin the portion between West Water Street and the southern boundary. Main Street now represents what was then the boundary between the Brady farm and Isaac Walton's. In 1797, ten years after coming to Muncy, Benjamin McCarty conceived the idea of starting a town, and began laying out lots on what is now Main Street, and sold them to different parties. His example was followed by his brother William, north of Water street, and by Isaac Walton. The town was named Pennsborough in honor of the William Penn. The town grew slowly and was nothing but a village for many years. More than a quarter of a century passed before an act of incorporation was applied for. Finally, by act approved March 15, 1826, it was incorporated as a borough. On January 19, 1827, with a population of less than 600, the name was changed from Pennsborough to Muncy. This was done because many persons thought it was \\"too flat and long\\", and the new name would be more in accordance with the historical associations of the place, and serve to perpetuate the name of the tribe that first dwelt there, a tribe of Lenni Lenape named Monseys. =Picture Rocks= Picture Rocks was incorporated as a borough om September 27, 1875. But the history of Picture Rocks began long before European settlers first arrived in 1773. The name of the borough is derived from the pictographs that were left by some of the Native Americans who previously inhabited the Muncy Creek valley. The paintings on the cliffs above Muncy Creek have long since disappeared. The town is built upon land that was once a Munsee Indian village. Evidence of this is found in the arrowheads and other relics that have been found in the vicinity of the creek. The first warrant for property in the Picture Rocks area was issued by the Province of Pennsylvania to Henry Rody on June 3, 1773. The land was used very little and passed through several hands until 1848 when it was sold to A. R. Sprout and Amos Burrows, who went on to become the founding fathers of Picture Rocks. Sprout and Burrows worked to cleared the land that was thought to be worthless of the rocks, logs and brush that covered it. They also rebuilt an abandoned sawmill and established a factory that manufactured sashes, doors, and window blinds. This factory, the first of its kind in the area, caused a stir among the local carpenters who believed that the readymade building materials would curtail their profit-making ability. The town grew up around the factory, and soon other manufacturers arrived to harness the water power provided by Muncy Creek. People interested in a lot in Picture Rocks were required to sign an agreement stating that they would not open a saloon or engage in the trafficking of liquor. This law was made by the residents and founders of the town, a majority of them being Baptists. The Baptists of Picture Rocks organized as a congregation in 1840 and met for a while in a school house. A traveling preacher arrived in Picture Rocks one Saturday evening and found the school to be unfit for Sunday gatherings. After delivering his Sunday morning sermon, he rallied the members of the congregation around the cause of building a proper house of worship. Under the guidance of their new pastor, the members of the Baptist Church built a log building that served as their church for 25 years that was replaced by a larger facility. =Salladasburg= Salladasburg was laid out by Jacob P. Sallade in 1837. He started the town with lots for homes and built a church for use by Lutherans and Presbyterians only. The population of Salladasburg was 374 as of the 1890 census. The borough had a number of stores and shops, one hotel, a gristmill, and tannery. There were two schools and three churches. Salladasburg was incorporated as a borough in May 1883 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. =South Williamsport= On November 29, 1886, the Lycoming County court incorporated the villages of Rocktown, Billman, and vicinities as the borough of South Williamsport. The land had previously been part of Armstrong Township. The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant 'people of the muddy river' in Lenape. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee clan or phratry of the Lenni Lenape, and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the Iroquois. The British purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. After the American Revolutionary War, Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County, on April 13, 1795. The county's area was originally over , and several other counties were subsequently formed from it. Williamsport, across the river from South Williamsport, was also founded in 1795 and chosen as the county seat. The first settler in what is now South Williamsport is believed to have been Aaron Hagerman, a transplanted Hollander, who is thought to have arrived shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War. Hagermans Run, which flows through the borough, bears his name. One of the predecessor communities was called Rocktown. And another was Bootstown. One of the first businesses was a tavern established near the mouth of Hagermans Run by Michael McDonough. Another early entrepreneur, Jacob Weiss, gave the village a push toward borough status by purchasing a tract of and laying out town lots. Weiss also established a brickyard near McDonough's tavern and for many years operated an oil mill and a gristmill. From those early times to the present, South Williamsport's fortunes have been linked to those of Williamsport. Sawmills and furniture factories were among the most prosperous industries in both communities. Planing mills and woodworking factories of all types reached a peak of activity during the logging boom of the post-Civil War years of the last century. The industry gradually declined in the 1890s when the surrounding hills were finally stripped of saleable lumber and the logging crews moved west.

It may include attempts at violence, unexpected strength, and very high body temperature. Complications may include rhabdomyolysis or high blood potassium. Excited delirium is not recognized by the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association, or the American Medical Association, and therefore not listed as a medical condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The UK Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody (IAP) suggests that the syndrome should be termed ‚ÄúSudden death in restraint syndrome‚Äù in order to enhance clarity. Examples of deaths due to the condition are found primarily in restraint or attempted restraint situations, while medical preconditions and symptoms attributed to the syndrome are far more varied. Definitions and symptoms EXD has been accepted by the American College of Emergency Physicians, who argue in a 2009 white paper that \\"excited delirium\\" may be described by several codes within the ICD-9. A November 2012 The Journal of Emergency Medicine literature review says that the American College of Emergency Physicians Task Force reached consensus, based on \\"available evidence, that Excited Delirium Syndrome (EDS) is a \\"real syndrome with uncertain, likely multiple, etiologies.\\" According to the 2020 publication, \\"excited delirium syndrome\\" is a \\"clinical diagnosis\\" with symptoms including delirium, psychomotor agitation, and hyperadrenergic autonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis was not in the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 or the 1992 International Classification of Diseases. Treatment and prognosis Treatment initially may include ketamine or midazolam and haloperidol injected into a muscle to sedate the person. Rapid cooling may be required in those with high body temperature. Other supportive measures such as intravenous fluids and sodium bicarbonate may be useful. One of the benefits of ketamine is its rapid onset of action. The risk of death among those affected is less than 10%. If death occurs it is typically sudden and cardiac in nature. Concern has been raised by some medical professionals about the increasing usage of a claim of excited delirium to justify tranquilizing persons during arrest, with requests for tranquilization often being made by law enforcement rather than medical professionals, ketamine is the most commonly used drug in these cases.  Epidemiology  How frequently cases occur is unknown. Males are affected more often than females. Those who die from the condition are typically male with an average age of 36. Often law enforcement has used tasers or physical measures in these cases, and death most frequently occurs after the person is forcefully restrained. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms for excited delirium may include: * Severe panic or distress, often exhibiting paranoia * Disorientation *Dissociation * Aggressiveness and combativeness * Fast heart rate * Hallucination * Diaphoresis (profuse sweating) * Incoherent speech or shouting * Unexpected strength (typically while trying to resist restraint) * Hyperthermia (overheating) * Inappropriately clothed e.g. having removed garments Cause Excited delirium occurs most commonly in males with a history of serious mental illness or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine and MDPV. Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition. Physical struggle, especially if prolonged, has been shown to greatly exacerbate many of the harmful symptoms such as metabolic acidosis, hyperthermia, catecholamine surge, and tachycardia. A majority of fatal cases involved men in a law enforcement or restraint situation. People with excited delirium frequently have acute drug intoxication, generally involving PCP, methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), cocaine, or methamphetamine. Other drugs that may contribute to death are antipsychotics. The cause is often related to long-term drug use or mental illness. Commonly involved drugs include cocaine, methamphetamine, or certain substituted cathinones. In those with mental illness, rapidly stopping medications such as antipsychotics may trigger the condition. Mechanisms The pathophysiology of excited delirium is unclear, but likely involves multiple factors. These may include positional asphyxia, hyperthermia, drug toxicity, and/or catecholamine-induced fatal abnormal heart rhythms. The underlying mechanism may involve dysfunction of the dopamine system in the brain. Diagnosis Key signs of excited delirium are aggression, altered mental status, and diaphoresis/hyperthermia. Other conditions which can resemble excited delirium are mania, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hypoglycemia, thyroid storm, and catatonia of the malignant or excited type. History In 1849 a similar condition was described by Luther Bell as \\"Bell's mania\\". The first use of the term \\"excited delirium\\" (EXD) was in a 1985 Journal of Forensic Sciences article, co- authored by coroner, Charles V. Wetli, entitled \\"Cocaine-induced psychosis and sudden death in recreational cocaine users\\". The JFS article reported that in \\"five of the seven\\" cases they studied, deaths occurred while in police custody. Controversy related to policing techniques The condition is not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, American Medical Association or the World Health Organization. Critics of excited delirium have stated that the condition is primarily attributed to deaths while in the custody of law enforcement and is disproportionately applied to black and Hispanic victims. Eric Balaban of the American Civil Liberties Union argued in 2007 that the diagnosis served \\"as a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest.\\" =Taser use= Some civil-rights groups argue that excited delirium diagnoses are being used to absolve law enforcement of guilt in cases where alleged excessive force may have contributed to patient deaths.\\"'Excited delirium' as a cause of death\\" , Daniel Costello, Los Angeles Times, April 21, 2003 In 2003, the NAACP argued that excited delirium is used to explain the deaths of minorities more often than whites. In Canada, the 2007 case of Robert Dziekanski received national attention and placed a spotlight on the use of tasers in police actions and the diagnosis of excited delirium. Police psychologist Mike Webster testified at a British Columbia inquiry into taser deaths that police have been \\"brainwashed\\" by Taser International to justify \\"ridiculously inappropriate\\" use of the electric weapon. He called excited delirium a \\"dubious disorder\\" used by Taser International in its training of police. In a 2008 report, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police argued that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police without formal approval after consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body.\\"An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\\" , John Kiedrowski, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, June 5, 2008 A 2010 systematic review published in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine argued that the symptoms associated with excited delirium likely posed a far greater medical risk than the use of tasers, and that it seems unlikely that taser use significantly exacerbates the symptoms of excited delirium.

He did not stand at the 1727 British general election and was out of parliament for ten years. He decided to stand again for Cambridge at a by election in 1737 with the support of Samuel Shepheard, in opposition to another Tory candidate put forward by Cotton. Cotton had lost favour with the corporation by this time, and Affleck was returned as MP on 10 February 1737. He did not stand at the 1741 general election. Affleck died on 12 November 1764, aged 79.

He was also an Ireland rugby union international and rugby union referee. He was the first Olympic athlete to represent two different nations. He is also the only Ireland rugby union international to ever win an Olympic Gold medal. In 2012 his collection of medals and international caps were donated to Belvedere College by his daughter Rosemary and son Noel. Early life Purcell was born in Dublin. He was the son of Daniel Purcell, a solicitor who was originally from Limerick, and Mary Clara Hoey who was from Dublin. He had two older siblings, a brother and a sister. In 1911 the Purcell family were living in Leeson Street. Purcell was educated at Belvedere College, Clongowes Wood College and Trinity College, Dublin. During the First World War, he served as a second lieutenant and then as a captain with the Leinster Regiment. He was injured while serving on the Western Front. Water polo player =Clubs and province= Purcell was a member of both Dublin University Swimming Club and the Dublin Swimming Club. As a swimmer he won four Irish Amateur Swimming Association championship titles between 1911 and 1920. In 1911 and 1912 he won the titles over 880 yards, in 1919 he won the 220 yards gold medal and in 1920 he was champion over 440 yards. In 1913 and 1921, as a water polo player, he won two Leinster Senior Cups with Dublin University. He also helped Dublin University win an All Ireland title in 1920. In a 1921 Leinster Senior League game against Pembroke, Purcell scored all four goals for Dublin University in a 4‚Äì2 win. Purcell also represented Leinster at provincial level. =Great Britain= At the 1920 Summer Olympics, Purcell was a member of the Great Britain team that won the gold medal. It was originally intended that Great Britain would be represented by the England national team. However, in a final trial game, England were beaten 6‚Äì0 by a Rest of Great Britain team featuring Purcell. This subsequently saw Purcell included in the Olympic squad. Although representing Great Britain, pictures from the Olympics, show Purcell wearing a swimming costume with a shamrock and the word \\"Ireland\\" on it. In the Olympic final, Great Britain beat Belgium 3‚Äì2 to win the gold medal. Other members of the team included Charles Sydney Smith, Paul Radmilovic, Charles Bugbee, Christopher Jones, William Peacock and William Henry Dean.David Needham: Ireland‚Äôs First Real World Cup -The Story of the 1924 Ireland Olympic Football Team (2012, The Manuscript Publisher) =Ireland= Purcell played for Ireland from 1910 to 1932. At the 1924 Summer Olympics he captained the Ireland team. Having previously represented Great Britain in 1920, Purcell now became the first Olympic athlete to represent two different nations. In the quarter final against Czechoslovakia, Purcell scored twice as Ireland lost 4‚Äì2. Purcell was also selected to represent Ireland at the 1928 Summer Olympics. However he declined because of his business commitments as a solicitor. He also wanted to give younger players the opportunity to play at an Olympics.Games of the VIII Olympiad: Official Report p.489 Purcell also represented Ireland at the Tailteann Games. Rugby union career =Clubs and province= Purcell played club rugby union for both Dublin University and Lansdowne. He was club captain at Lansdowne for the 1919‚Äì20 and 1920‚Äì21 seasons.

He made his final appearance for Ireland against France on 9 April at the Stade Colombes. =Referee and Selecter= Purcell refereed the 1927 Five Nations Championship match between England and Scotland. As a referee, he was not as fast around the field as he had been as a player. A match report in The Times noted \\"NM Purcell from Ireland refereed casually and from a great distance.\\" Between 1939 and 1941 Purcell also served as selecter for Ireland.

It is composed of coins denominated in centas (plurals centai and cent≈≥) and litas (plurals litai and lit≈≥) 1, 2, and 5 centai Image:1centas 1991 Lietuva.png1 centas - 1991 release Image:2 centai (1991).jpg2 centai - 1991 release Image:5 centai (1991).jpg5 centai - 1991 release These coins are made from aluminium and therefore are white. The coins' edge is plain. They were designed by sculptor Petras Gar≈°ka. These coins are the first permanent coins released after the restoration of independence in 1990. Unlike other coins they bear the same date - 1991 - no matter the year of actual production. The design has not changed even though they bear an old version of the Coat of Arms (the horse's tail looks down instead of up, the knight is leaning forward, and other details). People usually refer to these coins as \\"balti centai\\" (white cents) which has a slightly negative connotation. =Specifications= *1 centas coin: diameter - 18.75 mm, thickness - 1.30 mm, weight - 0.83 g. The 1 centas coin has a square ornament with triangle tulips in each corner. In the center there is a symbol of the columns of Gediminas. *2 centai coin: diameter - 21.75 mm, thickness - 1.30 mm, weight - 1.12 g. The 2 centai coin has an ornament shaped as a primitive spindle. It is composed of three open triangles and a stylized sun pattern on the top. The sun pattern is composed of 16 elements. *5 centai coin: diameter - 24.40 mm, thickness - 1.35 mm, weight - 1.4 g. The 5 centai coin has an ornament shaped as a wind vane. The central element is a leaf. On top of the ornament is a cross. Both sides of the leaf have a decorative element, a small snake. Below are two small angels blowing trumpets. 10, 20, and 50 cent≈≥ Image:10 centai (1997).jpg10 cent≈≥ - 1997 release Image:20 centai (1997).jpg20 cent≈≥ - 1997 release Image:50 centai (1997).jpg50 cent≈≥ - 1997 release These coins are made from a gold-yellow alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel. The edges are rimmed. The coins were designed by Antanas ≈Ωukauskas with the help of Arvydas Ka≈ædailis in adapting the Coat of Arms. They were released in 1997 and replaced the 10, 20, and 50 cent≈≥ coins released in 1991. They bear the year in which they were produced in. =Specifications= *10 cent≈≥ coin: diameter - 17 mm, thickness - 1.7 mm, weight - 2.6 g. The 10 cent≈≥ coin has an ornamental triangular fir tree pattern in the background. The triangle points downwards and the apex is matched to the vertical axis of the coin. *20 cent≈≥ coin: diameter - 20.5 mm, thickness - 2.1 mm, weight - 4.8 g. The 20 cent≈≥ coin has a horizontal ornamental \\"fir tree\\" pattern under the number 20. *50 cent≈≥ coin: diameter - 23 mm, thickness - 2.1 mm, weight - 6 g. The 50 cent≈≥ coin has an ornamental fir tree pattern divided into fourteen equal parts which runs alongside the rim. 1, 2, and 5 litai Image:1 litas coin (1997).jpg1 litas - 1998 release Image:2 litai coin (1997).jpg2 litas - 1998 release Image:5 litai coin (1997).jpg5 litas - 1998 release These coins are made from a white alloy of copper and nickel; and from a gold-yellow alloy of copper, aluminium, and nickel. The coins were designed by Antanas ≈Ωukauskas with the help of Arvydas Ka≈ædailis in adapting the Coat of Arms. They were released in 1998 and replaced the 1, 2, and 5 litai banknotes. The primary reason for the change was that these banknotes are short-lived because they are used in everyday trade. They are subject to wear and tear and needed to be constantly re-printed in foreign countries, while the new coins could be minted domestically at the Lithuanian Mint. They bear the year in which they were produced in. People sometimes complain that the coins are too heavy. =Specifications= *1 litas coin: diameter - 22.3 mm, thickness - 2.2 mm, weight - 6.25 g. The 1 litas coin has an edge that is rimmed. The number 1 is in a hollow circle located in the upper part of the coin. Under the circle there is a symmetrical ornament formed by a series of curved bars. *2 litai coin: diameter - 25 mm, thickness - 2.2 mm, weight - 7.5 g. The 2 litai coin has an edge that is divided into 5 rimmed sections parted by gaps of plain surface. 3 central bars of each section are thicker than the rest. The outside circle has an ornament formed of 2 groups of curved bars that are positioned symmetrically to the vertical axis of the coin. *5 litai coin: diameter - 27.5 mm, thickness - 2.35 mm, weight - 10.1 g. The 5 litai coin edge has an inscription: PENKI LITAI (five litai) repeated twice and separated by a mark. The outside circle bears an ornament formed from three evenly spaced groups of curved bars. Commemorative circulation coins \\"Lithuanian Mint\\" releases 3-6 commemorative coins yearly. In addition, there are 4 circulation commemorative coins released, all in 1 litas domination. They all are from a 75% copper and 25% nickel alloy. =Specifications= * 1997 release - for the 75th anniversary of the litas and Bank of Lithuania (200,000 pieces). Coin's diameter is 22.30 mm, thickness - 2.20 mm, weight - 6.25 g. This coin bears the portrait and signature of the first chairman of Bank of Lithuania Vladas Jurgutis (1885‚Äì1966) whose signature is the first litas banknotes released in the interwar period. The same design, size, and denomination coin was also minted in gold (1,500 pieces). It was designed by sculptor Rimantas Eidƒójus. * 1999 release for the 10th anniversary of the Baltic way, when about two million people formed a live 600 kilometer chain protesting against the Soviet occupation (1,000,000 pieces). Coin's diameter is 22.30 mm, thickness - 2.20 mm, weight - 6.25 g. The reverse shows three pairs of hands holding. The clothes are stylized traditional clothes of the three Baltic States. Also, hands are feminine - a symbol of three Baltic sisters (in Lithuanian language all three Baltic states' names are feminine nouns). This coin was criticized for having Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia names on it: it confuses which country's coin it is. The same design was used to mint the 50 lit≈≥ silver coin of 38.61 mm diameter (4,000 pieces). The only change in design was the edge of the silver coin has an inscription VILNIUS RYGA TALINAS (Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn - the capitals of three Baltic states in Lithuanian). The designer is Antanas ≈Ωukauskas. * 2004 release for the 425th anniversary of Vilnius University in 2004 (200,000 pieces). Coin's diameter is 22.30 mm, thickness - 2.20 mm, weight - 6.25 g. The reverse shows Vilnius University architectural ensemble, emphasizing the great courtyard and St. John's church and its belfry. This image is somewhat similar to the reverse of 100 lit≈≥ banknotes. The same design was used to mint the 50 lit≈≥ silver coin of 38.61 mm diameter (2,000 pieces). The only 2 changes in design was that the silver coin's edge is inscribed with UNIVERSITAS VILNENSIS (when Vilnius University was founded in 1579, it was called Academia et Universitas Vilnensis) and that the silver coin has a field that changes appearance: from one angle it shows 2004 (date of coin release) and 1579 (date of founding Vilnius University) from another. This is the first time such technology was used in Lithuanian coins. The coin was designed by Rytas Jonas Beleviƒçius. * 2005 release to promote restoration of Lithuania's Royal Palace (Valdov≈≥ R≈´mai) in 2005 (1,000,000 pieces). Coin's diameter is 22.30 mm, thickness - 2.20 mm, weight - 6.25 g. This coin uses coat of arm image found on Grand Duchy of Lithuania coins, and not the modern one. This old coat of arms and the dodecagon it has inside its rims creates an impression that the coin is one of the old Great Duchy coins. This illusion was created to emphasize the importance of cultural heritage. The reverse shows how Lithuania's Royal Palace will look like when its reconstruction is complete in 2009 for the 1000th anniversary of Lithuania's name (Lithuania was first mentioned as Litua in 1009 in Quedlinburg monastery's chronicle). The coin was designed by Giedrius Paulauskis.

According to ICANN Bylaw XI.4.a, \\"ALAC is the primary organizational home within ICANN for individual Internet users\\",http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#XI with a mandate to \\"consider and provide advice on the activities of ICANN, insofar as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users\\".http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#XI Structure and mission The ALAC is composed by fifteen members, three from each of the five geographic regions used by ICANN for geographical diversity requirements. As a part of its mission, the ALAC reaches out for groups of individual Internet users all around the world - identified as At-Large Structures (ALSes) - and encourages them to apply for accreditation by ICANN. Once accredited, these groups can participate in the five Regional At-Large Organizations (RALOs), regional groupings that host discussions at a regional level. In turn, each RALO appoints two members of the ALAC (for a total of ten members out of fifteen). This builds an open, bottom-up mechanism to select the ALAC members. The remaining five members of the ALAC are appointed by ICANN's Nominating Committee. The ALAC appoints one non-voting representative to the councils of the Generic Names Supporting Organization and to the Country Code Names Supporting Organization, and liaisons to ICANN working groups and task forces. It also appoints five members (one per geographic region) of ICANN's Nominating Committee. It has some statutory authority, though limited, to influence ICANN's policy making activities. However, it usually shares its opinions through non-binding advisory statements sent to the ICANN Board. Originally the ALAC appointed a liaison to the ICANN Board; however, that position was abolished in 2010 when an additional, fully voting position on the ICANN Board was designated to be selected by the At-Large community. The first person selected by this process, joining the ICANN Board in October 2012, was former ALAC member S√©bastien Bachollethttps://community.icann.org/display/DirCan/At- Large+Director+Candidate+2010+Workspace History The ALAC was created in 2002, as one of the changes introduced in the so-called \\"ICANN 2.0\\" reform, with the purpose of providing a viable mechanism for participation by a significant number of active individual users of the Internet from around the world. Its structure was studied through the At-Large Advisory Committee Assistance Group, which made a proposal that was then approved by the ICANN Board. The first ALAC was appointed in January 2003. Since the Regional At- Large Organizations did not exist yet, the committee was marked as \\"interim\\" and the ten regional members were appointed by the ICANN Board instead. The initial membership included the former ICANN Chairman Esther Dyson. The initial Chairman was Vittorio Bertola, and the first appointed liaison to the ICANN Board was Roberto Gaetano, and Thomas Roessler to the GNSO, who in December 2004 left his position to Bret Fausett. In March 2006, Bertola left the Chairmanship to Annette Muehlberg; in December 2006, Bertola was appointed as the new Board liaison, Alan Greenberg as GNSO liaison, and Siavash Shahshahani as CCNSO liaison. Initially, there was widespread concern that the ALAC would fail as a result of a perception of disenfranchisement common to many Internet rights groups - especially the North American ones - that followed the demise by ICANN of the original At Large election plan. However, the number of accredited At Large Structures grew slowly but steadily, reaching 100 in the first months of 2007. In December 2006, the first Regional At-Large Organization - the Latin American RALO was formally accredited by ICANN. Further RALOs for Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific were expected to be accredited in the first half of 2007.

Pearl Williams (September 10, 1914 - September 18, 1991) was an American entertainer. Career Born Pearl Wolfe, Williams started out as a secretary, but quickly turned to playing the piano by ear and became an accomplished player. In 1938 she went to an audition for a singer as accompaniment. She was hired on the spot and that same night went on stage at the Famous Door on 52nd Street with Louis Prima's band. But it took 14 years and a heckler to make her find her calling. One night, in 1952, a heckler was consistently telling her to get off and that her jokes were horrible, and she said to him, \\"Oh, fuck off!\\" The audience howled, and she quickly became a hit. In 1961, signed by Stanley Borden, the owner of After Hours Records, she recorded her first album, A trip around the world is not a cruise. Known for her bawdy humor and aggressive manner, she released nine best-selling \\"party\\" records during her career, including: * All the Way * Bagels & Lox! * She's Doin' What Comes Naturally! * A Trip Around the World is Not a Cruise * You'll Never Remember it, Write it Down! * Battle of the Mothers! (with Belle Barth) * Party Snatches ‚Äì the Best of . . . (featured) Williams is one of several female Jewish comedians (along with Belle Barth, Patsy Abbott, Rusty Warren and Totie Fields) who traced their \\"bawdy\\" performance style back to Sophie Tucker. The back cover of A Trip around The World is Not a Cruise repeats the anecdote that when they met, Tucker told Williams that \\"You're me at your age, only better.\\" An echo of Tucker can be discerned when Williams says in her act, \\"I get broads come in here, they sit in front of me and they stare at me. Everything I do, they stare at me. Then they walk out saying, 'She's so dirrr- ty!' If they're so refined how come they understand what I'm saying?\\" Williams performed for 18 years at the Place Pigalle in Miami, Florida, before retiring in 1984, commenting \\"I'm tired, I need a rest. After 46 years in show business, night after night, day after day, non-stop, I'm tired\\". She hung up her microphone for good in April of that year. She lived out her final years in North Miami Beach and Long Island. On September 18, 1991, aged 77, she died in her sleep from heart disease.

Angerstein was a member of an old family of Swedish Iron Masters, of German descent. He passed his matriculation in Uppsala 1727 and then worked as an auditor at the Swedish Board of Mines (Bergskollegium) between 18 and 24 years of age. At the age of 31 he started a series of long journeys abroad, financed by the Swedish Association of Iron Masters (Jernkontoret). From these trips he wrote extensive and illustrated travel accounts back to Sweden. He primarily described technical and economic observations from mining and from Iron and Steel Works. Between 1749 and 1757 he was constantly travelling, with only few short spells in Sweden: in Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain. After returning to Sweden he got a position at Bergskollegium as Director of Steelworks (Direkt√∂r f√∂r rikets gr√∂fre svartsmide). There exist illustrations also from his inspection tours of Swedish Iron Works. Towards the end of his life he purchased the Vira Iron Works in Uppland in 1757, northeast of Stockholm, renowned for forging of weapons for the army. He had far-reaching plans to extend this plant, but had no time to implement them before his death in 1760. Between 1753 and 1755 he visited England and Wales, where he was considered an industrial spy. His visit to Sheffield was brief, less than a day, and it has been suggested that he was driven out of the town for showing too much interest in the crucible process newly invented by Benjamin Huntsman.materialising Sheffield To read more *R R Angerstein's Illustrated Travel Diary 1753-1755: industry in England and Wales from a Swedish perspective, translated by Torsten & Peter Berg, The Science Museum, London 2001, *G√∂ran Ryd√©n & A.

Cicada has been prized as a delicacy, andDalby (2003: p.86) states that: \\"The cicada was a better-known food in Greece than in Rome. The grubs or nymphs were nicer to eat than the mature insects, says Aristotle. Boiled cicada was recommended in the treatment of bladder disorders. The cicada is Greek tettix, Latin cicada.\\" are famed throughout the world for their song. The cicada is an animal replete with symbolism: recurring themes are resurrection, immortality, spiritual realization and spiritual ecstasy. For the Ancient Greeks and Romans they sang ecstatically, were sacred to Apollo and related to the dionysiac bacchae and maenads. Eunomos and his cithara Egan (1994) cites several Greek sources that tell the story of Eunomos and the cicada. Eunomos, an accomplished citharaThe cithara, as an instrument of professional musicians, is an attribute of Apollo. player and singer, was performing in a competition when one of the cithara strings snaps. A cicada as offering, alights on his cithara, sustaining the note of the broken string. Eunomos, thereby attributed accolade, wins the competition. Aristotle Aristotle, fond of eating cicadas,Aristotle, History of Animals, Bk. 5, Ch. 30, 556b6-14. described them briefly in his Historia Animalium. From this, we know that he was aware of their periodic lifecycle, their resurrection from the earth, their progression to winged form and their song. Aristotle is attributed with disseminating in Greek culture cicada symbolism of resurrection and immortality; although their liminal aspect and propensity to incite admiration pre-date Aristotle. Phaedrus, Plato and Socrates In Phaedrus, a dialogue authored by Plato, the sage Socrates and his student of rhetoric Phaedrus engage in repartee in an idyllic setting on a riverbank in the shade of a tree occupied by a chorus of cicadas.Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue set with Socrates in the country outside of Athens. These cicadas are not simply decorative; they add a profound metaphor, transcendent musical motif and a liminal aspect to the dialogue of Socrates and Phaedrus. It is in Phaedrus that Socrates states that some of life's greatest blessings flow from maniaPlato's Phaedrus, R. Hackforth, 1952, Cambridge U. Press specifically in the four kinds of mania: (1) prophetic; (2) poetic; (3) cathartic; and (4) erotic. It is in this context that Socrates' Myth of the Cicadas is presented. The Cicadas chirp and watch to see whether their music lulls humans to laziness or whether the humans can resist their sweet song. Cicadas were once humans who, in ancient times, allowed the first Muses to enchant them into singing and dancing for so long they stopped eating and sleeping and died without noticing. The Muses rewarded them with the gift of never needing food or sleep, and of singing from birth to death. The task of the Cicadas is to watch humans and report who honors the Muses and who does not. In the dialogue, Socrates affirms that nymphs and local divinities or spirits of place inhabit the countryside; talks of the Muses and nature gods such as Pan; in addition he indulges in an extended exegesis of his own d√¶mon; waxes lyrical, connecting divine inspiration to religion, poetry, art and love; all of which are informed and set in poignant relief by the cicada chorus.

All banknotes were of the same size (135 mm √ó 65 mm) except for the 500 lit≈≥ banknote. They bore signatures of Minister of Finance and/or of Chairperson of the Bank of Lithuania Board. 10, 20, and 50 lit≈≥ banknotes had 4 releases. This was mainly due to security reasons: number of security features was gradually increased from virtually 0, to 9, 14 and eventually to 17. The first release bore the date \\"1991\\" but were actually released to the public in 1993 for a very brief time (June‚ÄìOctober). Since they were replaced in the same year, the first release is dated to 1991 and the second to 1993. The banknotes were not printed in Lithuania. At first they were printed by the United States Banknote Corporation, later by the UK-based Thomas De La Rue & Co. Ltd. and the Germany-based Giesecke & Devrient GmbH. 10 lit≈≥ 1991, 1993 and 1997 releases. The reverse of the 10 lit≈≥ banknote featured Lithuanian heroes, Steponas Darius and Stasys Girƒónas. In 1933 they flew from New York City over the Atlantic Ocean with a small plane called Lituanica. However, the plane mysteriously crashed in Germany (now Poland). The duo did not survive. The obverse depicts Lituanica flying over the Atlantic Ocean with visible shores of the North America and Europe. This banknote was noticed by the international press covering the introduction of the litas. Journalists made a metaphor that the litas should do better than the pilots, i.e. the litas, hopefully, would not crash. The most recent release clearly shows Darius wearing the cap with an insignia from then-Palwaukee Municipal Airport (now Chicago Executive Airport) located in Wheeling, Illinois.PALWAUKEE AIRPORT (ILLINOIS) FEATURED ON LITHUANIAN BANKNOTE Mich-Matist, Winter 2003 (March), Vol 39-1, #143. Pp. 19-27. It attracted some attention from collectors. The banknote was designed and redesigned by Giedrius Jonaitis. The very first draft of new Lithuanian currency had Darius and Girƒónas on the 5 litai banknote. It was released in different designs four times (in 1993 (twice), 1997, and 2001). The first banknote design started an international scandal. In 1992, these banknotes were printed and ready to be released to the public. However, it was discovered that they were virtually unprotected against counterfeiting. It delayed the introduction of the litas as the banknotes had to be reprinted. The banknotes bearing the date \\"1991\\" were released for a very short time and were quickly replaced by the 1993 issue. The major design ideas have not changed throughout the issues. In 1993, on the 60th anniversary of Lituanica's flight, the 10 lit≈≥ silver commemorative coin was issued featuring the pilots. It was the second commemorative coin issued by \\"Lithuanian Mint\\" (the first was for Pope John Paul II's visit to Lithuania). 20 lit≈≥ 1991, 1993, and 1997 releases. The banknote features a portrait of the Lithuanian romantic poet Maironis (real name Jonas Maƒçiulis, 1862‚Äì1932) who was a great patriot and made efforts to \\"wake up\\" the nation, to inspire resistance to Russification policies and fight for the independence of Lithuania from Imperial Russia. The obverse features the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas, with its carillon tower (the most famous exhibit in the museum is a wreckage of \\"Lituanica\\" airplane). The reverse also depicts the Statue of Liberty by Juozas Zikaras, commemorating the declaration of Lithuania's independence in 1918. The 20 lit≈≥ banknote released in 1930 also featured the same Statue of Liberty on the back, just it is on the left hand side. The obverse of the 1930 banknote featured Vytautas the Great himself. The banknotes printed in 1991, together with the 10 lit≈≥ banknotes, started an international scandal. The 1991 release was replaced very quickly. The 1993 release was designed by Justas Tolvai≈°is. The last issue was designed by Giedrius Jonaitis. The major change in 2001 issue was moving the Statue of Liberty from the left hand side to the right on the back. 50 lit≈≥ 1991, 1993, and 1998 releases. The obverse bears a portrait of the national patriarch, scholar, statesman and signatory of Lithuania's Declaration of Independence of February 16, 1918, Dr. Jonas Basanaviƒçius (1851‚Äì1927). Sometimes he is nicknamed as \\"father of independence\\" as he was the chairman of Council of Lithuania when the declaration was signed. The back of the banknote depicted Vilnius Cathedral and its belfry, Monument to Grand Duke Gediminas, Gediminas Castle and the Hill of Three Crosses. All these objects are considered as the heart of Vilnius and are strong national symbols. The 50 lit≈≥ banknote released in 1928 also features Basanaviƒçius and Vilnius Cathedral. It makes this banknote the only one that closely represents a banknote released in the interwar Lithuania. The 1991 release faced the same destiny as 10 and 20 lit≈≥ banknotes. They were released for a very short time. The 1993 release was designed by Ray Bartkus. At first the reverse depicted only Vilnius Cathedral and indistinctive houses of Vilnius Old Town. In 1998 release, however, the view of the cathedral shifted to include the other monuments. The 2003 issue was the last banknote added to the banknote family. Despite that, the view featured on the banknote appeared outdated as it failed to display the Royal Palace, which was under construction when banknote was released. 100 lit≈≥ 1991 release. It features Simonas Daukantas (1793‚Äì1864), the initiator of the national rebirth movement (when Lithuanians started to realize that they are one nation), historian, who wrote the first history of Lithuania in the Lithuanian language. The reverse shows the Vilnius Old Town, which is included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The focus is the architectural ensemble of Vilnius University with St. John's Church and its belfry. This makes Vilnius featured twice. The first 1991 release of the 100 lit≈≥ banknotes did not meet the same destiny as 10, 20, or 50 lit≈≥ banknotes. It was decided that it had sufficient security measures to be released and used. However, it did not spread widely and today together with other 1991 banknotes is withdrawn from the market. It could be exchanged for a new 100 lit≈≥ banknote only at Bank of Lithuania central office. The new banknote with 19 security features was introduced only in 2000. The appearance changed quite a bit. The back of the new banknote zoomed in more on the Vilnius University campus and left less space for other houses in Vilnius Old Town. Also, the colors were brighter and sharper. In format it resembled more 200 and 500 lit≈≥ banknotes than 10, 20, or 50. 200 lit≈≥ 200 lit≈≥ banknote (1997 release) The banknote featured a portrait of Vyd≈´nas (real name Vilhelmas Storosta, 1868‚Äì1953), a prominent Lithuanian philosopher, writer, poet, playwright, musician, pedagogue and culture educator. He was spreading idealistic philosophy and ideas of humanism through his works. The back depicted the Klaipƒóda (Memel) lighthouse erected in 1796 and reconstructed in 1819. The lighthouse was 29.2 m high and its beams stretched up to 35 kilometers. The lighthouse was a symbol of the city and was popular among tourists. However, it has not survived and is not well known today. However, it was very likely that Klaipƒóda was chosen because Vilnius was featured twice, Kaunas once, and Klaipƒóda is the 3rd largest city in Lithuania. The designer was Rytis Valantinas and it was the only release. 500 lit≈≥ 500 lit≈≥ banknote (2000 release) The banknote depicted a portrait of Vincas Kudirka (1858‚Äì1899), a Lithuanian writer, participant of the national rebirth movement and author of Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó, the national anthem. The back of the note showed Bell of the Freedom in the background of Nemunas loops, a well- known scenery. The bell has been inscribed in Lithuanian: \\"O skambink per am≈æius vaikams Lietuvos, kad laisvƒós nevertas, kas negina jos\\" (in English: \\"Thou shalt ring through the centuries to the children of Lithuania: he who does not defend freedom is not worthy of it\\"). This four-line poem was created by Bronius Kazys Balutis (1879‚Äì1967) and became the motto of Bell of Freedom, a newspaper published by one of the partisan groups. Also, Kudirka was one of the publishers of Varpas (\\"bell\\") newspaper to educate and inspire Lithuanians to for a nation and fight for independence during the Lithuanian national revival. This banknote was slightly bigger than the rest (147 mm x 70 mm) and has 22 security features (other banknotes have 16-19). At first it was doubted if Lithuania needs a 500 lit≈≥ banknote as it was more than a minimum monthly salary. The designer of the banknote was Giedrius Jonaitis and it was the only release. Former Designs Image:1 litas (1994).jpg1 litas - 1994 release Image:2 litai (1993).jpg2 litai - 1993 release Image:5 litai (1993).jpg5 litai - 1993 release 500 and 1000 lit≈≥ were designed for the first 1993 series, but never issued.

Function  The Cas family of proteins are a family of proteins that induce cellular apoptosis and cell proliferation. Apoptosis is a specialized sequence of events that a cell can induce for programmed death. Cas is a 2 terminal protein, a N-terminal and a C-terminal, and there is a positive correlation between the presence of CAS and the degree of cellular proliferation. ALong with this correlation, in the absence of the CAS protein in a cell, there is an inhibition of apoptosis Along with being an inducer of apoptosis, CAS also plays a role in being a checkpoint for cell cycle. Without the CAS protein, a cell will not be able to go beyond the G2 phase. It is in the nucleus of the cell, where its exportin function comes into play. The Cas family of proteins can be divided into 4 functional domains: expression, interference, adaption, and ancillary. The expression domain help with crRNA binding and with binding of targets. The interference module helps with the cleave of a target. The adaption domain helps with spacer acquisition. Lastly, the ancillary domain helps with regulation of the gene and other CRISPR functions. The CRISPR-Cas family of protein is also divided into 3 different types, Type I, Type II, Type III.

History  Prior to European settlement, the area had for thousands of years been the home to Native American tribes like the extinct Timucua. They left behind a rich archaeological history in the form of large middens of freshwater shellfish, which they deposited along the banks of the St. Johns River and Lake George. The Bluffton Mound and Midden at the Bluffton Recreation Area in Lake George State Forest is one such example. Lake George State Forest is formed from lands previously resourced for timber, production of naval stores, cattle grazing, and hunting. Cypress logging, by way of canals dug into the swampland, occurred up until 1910. The 1930s saw much of the land forested with longleaf and slash pine, or left in service of the Florida cracker cattle industry. After decades of aggressive harvesting, the 1960s saw reforestation efforts again plant slash pine. Dry conditions brought on by severe drought led to massive wildfires in 1998, which left close to half of the forest charred and damaged. After efforts to salvage the area's timber, restoration again involved planting of pine seedlings.  Natural features  Astor. Lake George State Forest is named for Lake George, the largest lake in Florida after Lake Okeechobee, and the largest lake of the St. Johns River system. The river itself bounds a section of the forest, offering both a vibrant ecology and a wealth of recreation opportunities. The forest and associated wetlands are located within the Lake George watershed, and as such, serve as an important aquifer recharge area. The arboreal composition of the Lake George State Forest is primarily longleaf and slash pines, with bald cypress and other bottomland hardwood hammocks found in lowland deposits and along the floodplain.

The population of the parish of Lecropt is estimated to be around 75, consisting entirely of isolated farms and houses, as well as the Keir Estate owned by the landed Stirling family. Lecropt today contains no town or village, though it lies on the outskirts of the village of Bridge of Allan. Historically, Lecropt's population was higher and was as high as 500 around the year 1800. The decline in population over the decades can be explained partly, but not wholly, by rural depopulation. However, in 1800 Bridge of Allan, then a tiny hamlet of no more than 100 people, was included in Lecropt. As Bridge of Allan grew during the 19th century, the whole village was eventually brought under the adjacent parish of Logie, reducing Lecropt's population. There had also been another village called Lecropt, the site of which was further north-west, on the other side of the line of the M9 motorway from the current parish church. This village hosted the parish church until this was moved to its present site in the early 19th century, on the A9 road. The village of Lecropt itself had been abandoned. Geography Historically about two thirds of this parish were situated within the county of Perth, and one-third in the county of Stirling. Today, Lecropt falls wholly within Stirling Council area. The River Teith bounds it on the south-west, where it meets the Forth and the Allan Water on the east. The southern point is where the Allan falls into the united streams of the other two. From east to west it extends about , and nearly about as much from north to south. It contains about , one-half of which - the southern part - is known as the Carse of Lecropt. The fertile soil of the carse is a rich clay. The other, northern half is upland, or what is generally called dry-field. Much of this consists of the policy lands of Keir House. The clay soil on the south is divided from the upland by a bank, which crosses the parish almost parallel to the north side, and nearly at one-third of the distance between it and the southern extremity. The political party Scottish Voice is based here, headquartered at the Keir Estate offices on the Lecropt Kirk-Doune road. The party contested its first election to the Scottish Parliament on 3 May 2007. Lecropt Kirk (see below) and nearby Lecropt Nursery, which used to be the parish school, stand on the A9 road leading out of Bridge of Allan, north towards Dunblane. Lecropt Kirk Lecropt Kirk Lecropt Kirk is a handsome essay in Gothic revival style, built in 1825-7 to the designs of David Hamilton and William Stirling, a local architect. It is a parish church of the Church of Scotland. Occupying an elevated position overlooking the carse lands, Stirling Castle and the Wallace Monument can be clearly seen from the church grounds and is located about a mile from Bridge of Allan and from Dunblane. The interior contains in its loft, vaults and monuments the influence of an old landed family, the Stirlings of Keir, built in the age of patronage. This late Georgian church is an early example of its style in Scotland, in company with the other carse Kirks of Kippen and Kincardine in Menteith. There has been a church at Lecropt prior to 1827, the old kirk was built in 1400 in what is now the Keir estate although nothing remains of the Kirk, except the old graveyard, which lies unloved, overgrown and difficult to access. It is known that there was a church at Lecropt prior to 1260.http://www.dunblaneweb.co.uk/lecropt/church20.jpg Important stained glass by Stephen Adam was added in 1907.

The M9 motorway passes through the parish. Imposing views of the church towering above the carse lands are to be had when travelling north on this motorway. However, no junction connects the motorway directly to Lecropt, access normally being via Keir roundabout (junction 11 on the M9) or through Bridge of Allan. Lecropt is in a very central position in Scotland's road network. The A9 leads north to Perth, Inverness and, via the A90, Dundee and Aberdeen. Southwards on the M9 is Edinburgh and, via the M80, Glasgow. Lecropt is served by Bridge of Allan railway station, which is ¬º mile south east of the church, connecting the parish with Dunblane, Stirling, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Records indicate that the library was located in Fort Vancouver, and provided service to officers of the Hudson's Bay Company. The service ended in 1843.Newsom 1954, p. 23. The Vancouver Catholic Library Association was established between the years of 1865 and 1870, and in 1872 was reported to maintain a collection of 1,000 volumes. The library was closed in 1886, and the collection was dispersed.Newsom 1954, p. 24 The Vancouver Library Association was formed on January 11, 1877. An initial collection of 27 books was gathered and housed in the same building as the Vancouver Independent, the local newspaper of the period. In 1878, the Good Templar Lodge disbanded and donated its collection of books and furniture to the Odd Fellows Lodge, for the purpose of setting up a free reading room. In December 1878, the Vancouver Library Association moved its small collection of books from the offices of the Independent to the newly established Free Reading Room.Newsom 1954, p. 28-29 By 1891, the library had changed locations several times and was in danger of being closed due to lack of funds. A petition was put before the city council to establish a tax-supported public library, and on April 4 of that year the request was granted. This tax supported library came to be called the Vancouver Public Library.Newsom 1954, p. 30 The first librarian for the Vancouver Library was C. W. Shane. In 1895, Mr. Shane noticed that many young people enjoyed reading, so he opened a circulating library of his own, called the Shane Library, specifically for the area youth.Newsom 1954, p. 31 In 1908, Edward Swan, an attorney, solicited the Home Trust Company for Carnegie Library Funds to build a new library. The request was approved, and by the middle of 1909 the new library building was completed.Newsom 1954, p. 33-4 Over the next 30 years, the Vancouver Public Library, headed by Mrs. Marion Pirkey, grew to nearly 20,000 volumes.Newsom 1954, p. 41 Meanwhile, another library was taking shape in Clark County, in the town of Camas, Washington. In 1923, a collection of books was gathered together and housed at a local drug store. After two years the collection was moved to an alcove at Camas City Hall, and later it was moved again to the Telephone Building. The popularity of the library grew over the next decade as Camas experienced rapid industrial growth. It was decided that a professional librarian was needed, and in January 1932 Eva Santee was hired. The library was well supported, and in 1939 a bond was passed supporting the building of a new library.Newsom 1954, p. 41-3 In 1940, Eva Santee took over as librarian of the Vancouver Public Library, and worked to set up rural library service for the outlying areas of Clark County and Skamania County. Bookmobile service was established and proved successful.Newsom 1954, p. 44 When the United States entered into World War II in 1942, Vancouver was heavily impacted due to the heavy population growth as workers flocked to the area to work at the Kaiser Shipyards. To support this new population, a petition was passed to establish a county library district. The measure was passed, and the first rural library district in Washington was established.Newsom 1954, p. 52 Near the end of 1942, another library system came into existence, through the Vancouver Housing Authority. Library quarters were set up in each housing project in the area. Funding difficulties for both the Vancouver Public Library and the Housing Authority Libraries caused some staff to leave the system, until only Eva Santee and a children's librarian remained.Newsom 1954, p. 53-4 In March 1943, all three library systems met and agreed to work together to provide library service to the area. Each system took on a variety of responsibilities, with the Vancouver Public Library providing the headquarters, the County Library maintaining the rural bookmobile services, and the Housing Authority Libraries maintaining a portion of the collection and providing some clerical personnel.Newsom 1954, p. 55 In 1944 the Clark County Library took over administration of the Vancouver Housing Authority Libraries. These libraries were located in the following neighborhoods: *McLoughlin Heights *Bagley Downs *Harney Hill *Fruit Valley Homes *Burton Homes *Ogden Meadows Newsom 1954, p. 56-7 In February, 1944 the Washougal Public Library in Washougal, Washington was made a branch of the Clark County Library System. The Washougal Public Library had its start in 1924 through the Washougal Women's Club. The library was housed in a variety of buildings. When the Library was integrated into the County Library System, the collection was moved to Washougal City Hall.Newsom 1954, p. 58 On April 1, 1944 the Battle Ground Library was opened in the Odd Fellows Hall of Battle Ground, Washington as part of the County Library System.Newsom 1954, p. 57 Over the next 5 years, the idea of unifying the County and the City Library systems was continuously discussed, without agreement being reached. It was not until July 1, 1950 that the two systems were successfully merged to form the Fort Vancouver Regional Library System, under the direction of Eva Santee.Newsom 1954, p. 76 At that time, the system consisted of one main library, six branch libraries, and two bookmobiles.Newsom 1954, p. 80 Though the new Regional Library District provided some service to schools in Skamania County, Skamania was not officially a part of the new District. Also, Camas City Library, though located in Clark County, was not a part of the Fort Vancouver Regional Library District.Newsom 1954, p. 83 =Later 20th century through early 21st century= Eva Santee retired in 1967 and was replaced as library director by Ruth Watson, who served from 1969-1987. During this time, the library opened up a new location in the Vancouver Mall and expanded its area of service to include Klickitat County. In 1988, Sharon Hamer became library director, and in 1993, the library catalog first became remotely accessible via dialup using the Dynix integrated library system. Bruce Ziegman took over as director in 2001. In 2009, Battle Ground Community Library was re-opened in a larger location, and new libraries were opened in Cascade Park and downtown Vancouver. Following Ziegman's departure in 2011, Operations Director Patty Duitman was appointed to be interim executive director by the Board of Trustees. Nancy Tessman, formerly of Salt Lake City Public library, was selected as the new director in 2012, and served through 2015. She was succeeded by current director Amelia Shelley in 2015.

It is the oldest house in Chelmsford, and has been preserved by the Garrison House Society as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The exact date the building was erected is not known; it is claimed by the Society to have been built before 1691, when it is claimed to be one of the houses listed as a garrison house in Chelmsford, but a 1702 deed transferring land on which it stands does not mention it. Thomas Adams deeded the land to his son, Peletiah Adams, in 1683, and Peletiah deeded the land to his two sons in 1702, who probably built the house. Stylistic analysis of its construction also supports a post-1700 construction date. The same stylistic analysis casts doubt on the belief that the house actually served as a fortified garrison. Before the title passed to the Garrison House Society in 1952, only three families had previously owned it. Very few modifications had been made to it in all that time, making it a relatively accurate historic showpiece.

Miles previously served as the head coach two small colleges and North Dakota State University, Colorado State University and the University of Nebraska. Miles is a graduate of the University of Mary. Miles is currently an analyst for the Big Ten Network, Fox Sports, and FS1. Coaching career =Early career= Following his playing career at Mary, Miles spent five seasons as an assistant coach at Northern State University, where the Wolves went to four NAIA II national tournaments and two national championship games. In 1995, Miles left to accept his first head coaching job at NAIA II Mayville State. In both his seasons at Mayville State, Miles led the Comets to NDCAC Championships and the NAIA II National Tournament. In 1997, he accepted the Southwest Minnesota State job and led the Mustangs to four straight winning seasons including a historic season in 2001. Leading Southwest State to their first NSIC championship and NCAA II regional berth. Southwest State won the North Central Region Championship and advanced to the NCAA II Elite Eight in Bakersfield, CA. Miles took over at North Dakota State in the spring of 2001. Shortly thereafter, the school declared its intent to reclassify from NCAA II to transition to NCAA I. The school would be ineligible for postseason play in its first five years of the transition, and was initially without a conference. On January 21, 2006, in just the school's second year in Division I, NDSU pulled off a shocking 62‚Äì55 upset of No. 12 Wisconsin at the Kohl Center. The Bison, starting three freshmen, ended Wisconsin's 27-game home winning streak against non-conference opponents. Miles would be named the Division I Independent Coach of the Year by CBS Sportsline. The following season the Bison pulled off another stunning upset, upsetting No. 8 Marquette in the championship game of the Blue and Gold Classic. The Bison finished 20‚Äì8, their best season under Miles. North Dakota State joined the Summit League the year after Miles departed and the Bison made the NCAA Tournament under the guidance of new head coach Saul Phillips, who was previously Miles' assistant. =Colorado State= On March 22, 2007, Miles was named head coach at Colorado State, replacing Dale Layer. Miles inherited just two players from the 2007 roster, and as a result the program struggled immensely. After going winless in conference play in his first season, Miles' teams gradually improved over the following years. In May 2011, after winning 19 games and guiding CSU to its seventh NIT appearance, he signed a 5-year contract extension with Colorado State. The following season, the Rams defeated three ranked teams, all at home at Moby Arena. On January 28, CSU upset No. 13 San Diego State for the program's first win over a ranked opponent since 2004. Just over a month later, the Rams stunned No. 18 New Mexico. Then, on February 29, Colorado State rallied from a 15-point deficit at halftime to defeat No. 17 UNLV 66-59. CSU finished 20‚Äì11 overall and 8‚Äì6 in the Mountain West, and was awarded an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. It was CSU's first trip to the tournament since 2003 and their first at-large bid since 1990. The Rams were the No. 11 seed in the West Regional and fell to No. 6 seed Murray State. =Nebraska= On March 24, 2012 Miles was named head coach at Nebraska, replacing Doc Sadler. Historically, the Cornhuskers have fielded one of the weakest high-major college programs in Division I, making the NCAA Tournament only six times before Miles' arrival and losing in the first round all six times. In 2014, Miles' second season, he coached the Huskers to the NCAA tournament, the school's first tournament berth since 1998, but the Cornhuskers lost to Baylor in the first round. After three seasons of single- digit conference wins, Miles guided the team to a 22‚Äì11 record in the 2017‚Äì18 season, achieving a program record 13 conference wins before falling in the first round of the NIT.http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&SPID;=24&SPSID;=22 In 2018-19, Miles led Nebraska to a 10-2 start and another Top 25 ranking, before several injuries derailed Nebraska's NCAA Tournament hopes. The Huskers made the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament but lost to Wisconsin 66-62. The Huskers made the Big Ten quarter-finals five of seven years under Miles. The NIT came calling again and the Huskers beat Butler, but lost at TCU to end their season at 19-17. The Huskers ranked 10th nationally in single-season attendance, averaging 15,341 fans per game, as Nebraska was one of nine programs nationally to average at least 15,000 fans in each of the past six seasons. Miles, the third winningest coach in history, was then relieved of his duties on March 26, 2019. http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID;=211797299 Head coaching record References 1966 births Living people American men's basketball coaches American men's basketball players Basketball coaches from South Dakota Basketball players from South Dakota College men's basketball head coaches in the United States College men's basketball players in the United States Colorado State Rams men's basketball coaches Mayville State Comets men's basketball coaches Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball coaches North Dakota State Bison men's basketball coaches Northern State Wolves men's basketball coaches People from Doland, South Dakota University of Mary alumni ","title":"Tim Miles"},{"id":"9738540","text":"Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) use information on the historical relationships of lineages (phylogenies) to test evolutionary hypotheses. The comparative method has a long history in evolutionary biology; indeed, Charles Darwin used differences and similarities between species as a major source of evidence in The Origin of Species. However, the fact that closely related lineages share many traits and trait combinations as a result of the process of descent with modification means that lineages are not independent. This realization inspired the development of explicitly phylogenetic comparative methods. Initially, these methods were primarily developed to control for phylogenetic history when testing for adaptation; however, in recent years the use of the term has broadened to include any use of phylogenies in statistical tests. Although most studies that employ PCMs focus on extant organisms, many methods can also be applied to extinct taxa and can incorporate information from the fossil record. PCMs can generally be divided into two types of approaches: those that infer the evolutionary history of some character (phenotypic or genetic) across a phylogeny and those that infer the process of evolutionary branching itself (diversification rates), though there are some approaches that do both simultaneously. Typically the tree that is used in conjunction with PCMs has been estimated independently (see computational phylogenetics) such that both the relationships between lineages and the length of branches separating them is assumed to be known.  Applications  Phylogenetic comparative approaches can complement other ways of studying adaptation, such as studying natural populations, experimental studies, and mathematical models. Interspecific comparisons allow researchers to assess the generality of evolutionary phenomena by considering independent evolutionary events. Such an approach is particularly useful when there is little or no variation within species. And because they can be used to explicitly model evolutionary processes occurring over very long time periods, they can provide insight into macroevolutionary questions, once the exclusive domain of paleontology. Home range areas of 49 species of mammals in relation to their body size. Larger-bodied species tend to have larger home ranges, but at any given body size members of the order Carnivora (carnivores and omnivores) tend to have larger home ranges than ungulates (all of which are herbivores). Whether this difference is considered statistically significant depends on what type of analysis is applied Testes mass of various species of Primates in relation to their body size and mating system. Larger-bodied species tend to have larger testes, but at any given body size species in which females tend to mate with multiple males have males with larger testes. Phylogenetic comparative methods are commonly applied to such questions as: * What is the slope of an allometric scaling relationship? ‚Üí Example: how does brain mass vary in relation to body mass? * Do different clades of organisms differ with respect to some phenotypic trait? ‚Üí Example: do canids have larger hearts than felids? * Do groups of species that share a behavioral or ecological feature (e.g., social system, diet) differ in average phenotype? ‚Üí Example: do carnivores have larger home ranges than herbivores? * What was the ancestral state of a trait? ‚Üí Example: where did endothermy evolve in the lineage that led to mammals? ‚Üí Example: where, when, and why did placentas and viviparity evolve? * Does a trait exhibit significant phylogenetic signal in a particular group of organisms? Do certain types of traits tend to \\"follow phylogeny\\" more than others? ‚Üí Example: are behavioral traits more labile during evolution? * Do species differences in life history traits trade-off, as in the so-called fast-slow continuum? ‚Üí Example: why do small-bodied species have shorter life spans than their larger relatives?  Phylogenetically independent contrasts  regressions, correlations, analysis of covariance, etc., must pass through the origin. Felsenstein proposed the first general statistical method in 1985 for incorporating phylogenetic information, i.e., the first that could use any arbitrary topology (branching order) and a specified set of branch lengths. The method is now recognized as an algorithm that implements a special case of what are termed phylogenetic generalized least-squares models. The logic of the method is to use phylogenetic information (and an assumed Brownian motion like model of trait evolution) to transform the original tip data (mean values for a set of species) into values that are statistically independent and identically distributed. The algorithm involves computing values at internal nodes as an intermediate step, but they are generally not used for inferences by themselves. An exception occurs for the basal (root) node, which can be interpreted as an estimate of the ancestral value for the entire tree (assuming that no directional evolutionary trends [e.g., Cope's rule] have occurred) or as a phylogenetically weighted estimate of the mean for the entire set of tip species (terminal taxa). The value at the root is equivalent to that obtained from the \\"squared-change parsimony\\" algorithm and is also the maximum likelihood estimate under Brownian motion. The independent contrasts algebra can also be used to compute a standard error or confidence interval.  Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS)  Probably the most commonly used PCM is phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS). This approach is used to test whether there is a relationship between two (or more) variables while accounting for the fact that lineage are not independent. The method is a special case of generalized least squares (GLS) and as such the PGLS estimator is also unbiased, consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal. In many statistical situations where GLS (or, ordinary least squares [OLS]) is used residual errors Œµ are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables that are assumed to be normal : \\\\varepsilon \\\\mid X\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, \\\\sigma^2I_n). whereas in PGLS the errors are assumed to be distributed as : \\\\varepsilon \\\\mid X\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, \\\\mathbf{V}). where V is a matrix of expected variance and covariance of the residuals given an evolutionary model and a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, it is the structure of residuals and not the variables themselves that show phylogenetic signal. This has long been a source of confusion in the scientific literature. A number of models have been proposed for the structure of V such as Brownian motion Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and Pagel's Œª model. (When a Brownian motion model is used, PGLS is identical to the independent contrasts estimator.). In PGLS, the parameters of the evolutionary model are typically co-estimated with the regression parameters. PGLS can only be applied to questions where the dependent variable is continuously distributed; however, the phylogenetic tree can also be incorporated into the residual distribution of generalized linear models, making it possible to generalize the approach to a broader set of distributions for the response.  Phylogenetically informed Monte Carlo computer simulations  Data for a continuous-valued trait can be simulated in such a way that taxa at the tips of a hypothetical phylogenetic tree will exhibit phylogenetic signal, i.e., closely related species will tend to resemble each other. Martins and Garland proposed in 1991 that one way to account for phylogenetic relations when conducting statistical analyses was to use computer simulations to create many data sets that are consistent with the null hypothesis under test (e.g., no correlation between two traits, no difference between two ecologically defined groups of species) but that mimic evolution along the relevant phylogenetic tree. If such data sets (typically 1,000 or more) are analyzed with the same statistical procedure that is used to analyze a real data set, then results for the simulated data sets can be used to create phylogenetically correct (or \\"PC\\") null distributions of the test statistic (e.g., a correlation coefficient, t, F). Such simulation approaches can also be combined with such methods as phylogenetically independent contrasts or PGLS (see above). left  See also  * Allometry * Behavioral ecology * Biodiversity * Bioinformatics * Cladistics * Comparative anatomy * Comparative method in linguistics * Comparative physiology * Computational phylogenetics * Disk-covering method * Ecophysiology * Evolutionary neurobiology * Evolutionary physiology * Generalized least squares (GLS) * Generalized linear model * Joe Felsenstein * Mark Pagel * Maximum likelihood * Maximum parsimony * Paul H.

Operations The group's most notable brand is the Caisse d'√©pargne network of mutual savings banks. Along with La Banque Postale and Cr√©dit Mutuel, the bank shared the rights to offer the popular Livret A savings accounts, backed by the French government until January 1, 2009. In addition, the group is also the owner of the mortgage bank Cr√©dit Foncier, the corporate and private bank Banque Palatine and Financi√®re Oc√©or, a commercial, private asset management and specialist finance bank serving France's overseas departments. In 2006 Groupe Caisse d'√©pargne merged its investment bank IXIS Corporate and Investment Bank with Groupe Banque Populaire's Natexis, creating Natixis, a publicly traded investment bank in which Caisse d'√©pargne and Groupe Banque Populaire currently hold an equal stake of 35.25%. Groupe Caisse d'√©pargne has also since merged its private wealth management bank La Compagnie 1818 into the Natixis group.

The CMT Association certifies that an individual is competent in the use of technical analysis via the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation. History Under its original name of Market Technicians Association, the organization was incorporated as a not-for-profit association in 1973, but began holding meetings since 1971. There were 18 charter members in 1973, but the three founders are considered to be Ralph Acampora, John Brooks and John Greeley. These charter members found that they were doing the same thing for a living (practicing technical analysis), and believed there should be an organization similar to the one that already existed for fundamental analysts. At first, the CMT Association was a New York-based group, however, as it became apparent that there were technical analysts all over the globe, the CMT Association transformed first to a U.S. based and eventually to a global professional association. The CMT Association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program emerged after significant work in the second half of the 1980s. The first tests were given and the first CMTs were granted in 1989. In 2005 the NASD (now FINRA) submitted a rule filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to accept the CMT 1 and 2 as an alternative to the series 86 examination required of financial analysts. Through most of the early years of its history, the CMT Association was located in various downtown New York City locations, usually in a shared space of other friendly associations (i.e., NY Institute of Finance [NYIF]; later the NY Society of Security Analysts [NYSSA]). In September, 2001 the CMT Association was in the World Trade Center when the Twin Towers fell. The CMT Association quickly relocated to space in Woodbridge, New Jersey and actively worked at building back its library of resources through, in large measure, the donations of members and friends of the CMT Association. The CMT Association moved back to a new downtown NYC location in early 2007, located at 61 Broadway‚ÄîSuite 514, NY, NY 10006, which is within one block of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The CMT Association relocated in May, 2017 to 25 Broadway, next to the famous Charging Bull. The organization changed its name from Market Technicians Association to CMT Association with effect from July 14, 2017. Mission The CMT Association is a not-for-profit professional regulatory organization servicing over 9,000 market analysis professionals in over 80 countries around the globe. The CMT Association‚Äôs main objectives involve the education of the public, the investment community and its membership in the theory, practice and application of technical analysis. The CMT Association has the following stated mission: * Attract and retain a membership of professionals devoting their efforts to using and expanding the field of technical analysis and sharing their body of knowledge with their fellow members. * Establish, maintain, and encourage the highest standards of professional competence and ethics among technical analysts. * Educate the public and the investment community of the value and universality of technical analysis. The CMT Association mission is accomplished through the effective execution of a wide variety of professional services including, but not limited to, seminars, local region/chapter meetings, the maintenance of an extensive library of technical analysis material and the regular publication of newsletters and journals. In addition, the CMT Association presents an annual Charles H. Dow Award for Excellence in Technical Analysis, the candidates for which submit papers for review by a board of CMT Association members. CMT Association members and affiliates include technical analysts, portfolio managers, investment advisors, market letter writers and others involved in the technical aspects of equities, futures, options, fixed income securities, currencies, international markets, derivatives, etc. Services provided to members and affiliates are performed by a small NYC based Headquarter staff, an active Board of Directors, Committee Chairs and an extensive cadre of volunteers located in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Chartered Market Technician As with other professional organizations that establish standards of competence for members, so the CMT Association provides a recognized standard of proficiency. The Chartered Market Technician program is the examination series that demonstrates proficiency in technical analysis. Candidates who pass the program's three examination levels, and who are also full members of the CMT Association, earn the Chartered Market Technician designation (CMT), certifying that the individual is competent in the use of technical analysis. In February 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recognized levels 1 and 2 of the CMT exam as an alternative to the Series 86 Examination, as part of the rule changes filed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and NYSE. This recognition on the part of securities regulators and the self-governing bodies of the securities industry provided significant new credibility to technical analysis. Knowledge Base The Knowledge Base is the CMT Association's repository of key Technical Analysis information. Primarily designed around the CMT Association Body of Knowledge, it consists of major 'domains,' which break down Technical Analysis content into easy-to-navigate sections. The Knowledge Base is also home to various Technical Analysis blogs, updated weekly with new content. Members Over 9,000 individuals belong to the CMT Association in over 80 countries worldwide. By occupation, technical analysts (42%) and traders (36%) comprise most of the CMT Association's members, along with portfolio managers (23%) and brokers (20%). The CMT Association is governed by a 12-member board of directors. Scott Richter is the current president. Past presidents include Craig Johnson, Ralph Acampora, Phil Roth, Charles Comer, Gail M. Dudack, Mike Epstein, Bruce M. Kamich, David Krell (co-founder and CEO of the International Securities Exchange), Jordan Kotick, Fred Meissner, Robert Prechter, Alan R. Shaw, Larry Berman, and David Keller. MTA Educational Foundation In 1993 the CMT Association established the MTA Educational Foundation, to \\"identify and fund educational programs in the field of technical analysis at accredited colleges and universities.\\" The foundation's mission has expanded to include the creation and support of a complete technical analysis curriculum, which is now being taught in classrooms at numerous colleges and universities across the country. The University of Richmond in Virginia offered the first fully accredited course in technical analysis in 1996; today more than 20 business schools offer such courses. The foundation also has an active outreach to financial professionals, via sponsored courses at the New York Society of Security Analysts, the Boston Security Analysts Society and the Centro Studi Bancari in Lugano, Switzerland. The foundation's board of directors includes distinguished university professors and Wall Street professionals.

Its dome has towered 180 feet above the south end of David R. Francis Quadrangle since its completion in 1895. In the lawn in front of Jesse Hall are The Columns, all that remains of its predecessor Academic Hall, which burned in 1892. The building contains the office of the chancellor, university registrar, graduate school, admissions, and financial aid. One of the most photographic landmarks in Missouri, the building was designed by Missouri architect Morris Frederick Bell, and is his largest surviving work. Jesse Auditorium had hosted graduations and countless university functions over the years. The University Concert Series presents national and international concerts, Broadway shows, performers, bands, speakers, and theater to the largest auditorium in Columbia. As the former home of the School of Music, student performances occasionally happen. The building is the most prominent contributing structure to the David R. Francis Quadrangle National Register of Historic Places District. In 1922 \\"New Academic Hall\\" became \\"Jesse Hall\\" in honor of retiring University President Richard Henry Jesse. History The burning of Academic Hall Jesse Hall at the time of completion (ca. 1895) with the original wings on the dome Academic Hall burned on January 9, 1892, leaving only the famous six columns that now stand in the center of Francis Quadrangle. The fire was ignited by an electric chandelier in the meeting room, the forerunner of Jesse Auditorium, during a debate. The \\"New Academic Hall\\", just south of the columns, was completed in 1895 at a cost of $250,000.The Maneater - Mystery of Jesse Dome In 1922, the hall was renamed in honor of retiring University president, Richard Henry Jesse. In 1932, a tornado ripped through Columbia and caused significant damage to the building. In 1982, a severe storm damaged Jesse Hall, resulting in renovations that included a new ball and new slate on the dome, tempered windows, reinforced beams, and a new paint job. The renovations cost roughly $390,000 and were paid for by state funds. On April 23, 1991, an arson fire caused $350,000-$500,000 in damage to the building. Architecture The building is one of the most distinctive on the campus; the dome stands a full 9 stories above the ground, and is actually taller than the building it stands on. It was designed by Morris Frederick Bell and fashioned after Richard M. Upjohn's Connecticut State House of 1872-1878. The dome was first lit in October 1987 to commemorate MU's sesquicentennial celebration. It is normally illuminated at night by bright white lights, but its color is changed to gold for Homecoming and green for Engineers' Week each March. A winged sphere originally surmounted the dome. The wings broke from the sphere when an exceptionally patriotic individual fastened the staff of a large American flag to the topmost part of the dome. The winged sphere lives on as the symbol of the secret society QEBH. William Lincoln Garver was assistant architect and superintendent of construction. Jesse Auditorium The original entrance to the auditorium was from the quad on the north side. It originally seated 1,200 people, but after being proclaimed a fire hazard the wooden balcony was removed, reducing capacity to only 400. A complete renovation of the auditorium was carried out in 1953 with a design by Jamieson and Spearl, and today it seats 1,732. Many great talents have graced the stage at Jesse. William Jennings Bryan gave his famous \\"Pending Problems\\" lecture there in 1900. Today, the University Concert Series books events such as touring Broadway shows, symphony orchestras, singers, and comedians from around the world.

The story details the difficulties of a repentant sinner's attempts to enter Heaven. Synopsis The story opens with the imminent death of a 70-year-old sinner. The man has never done a good deed in his life, and only with his last words did he address God and ask for forgiveness. When the man dies his soul comes before the gates of Heaven, but they are locked. The man knocks and knocks at the gates, but to no avail. Finally, the Accuser decrees that such a sinner cannot enter Heaven, and all the man's sins are recited. The sinner begs to be let in, but Peter the Apostle explains that such a sinner cannot be allowed in. The sinner points out that for all of Peter's virtue, he still sinned by denying Christ. He is still not let in. The sinner continues his knocking, and is again met by his list of sins by the Accuser. Now King David explains that such a sinner cannot be allowed in. The sinner points out that for all of David's virtue, he still sinned by committing adultery. He is still not let in. The sinner continues his knocking, and now is spoken to by John the Apostle. The sinner pleads with John, saying that he of all people should understand repentance. The repentant sinner is finally allowed into Heaven.

The Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery, the Investigation, and the Evidence That Could Change History () is a controversial book by Simcha Jacobovici and Charles R. Pellegrino (with a Foreword by James Cameron) published in February 2007. It tells the story of the discovery of the Talpiot Tomb on Friday March 28, 1980 (two days before Palm Sunday) and makes an argument that it is the tomb of Jesus Christ and his \\"family.\\" However, this claim has been rejected by a majority of leading experts and academics. The book is a tie-in with the documentary The Lost Tomb of Jesus, which was released on the Discovery Channel in early March 2007. The Names in the Tomb The tomb in Talpiot, excavated in 1980Discovery Channel :: News - Archaeology :: Jesus Family Tomb Believed Found during salvage archaeology, originally contained ten ossuaries - bone boxes for secondary burial. Of the ten, one vanished - presumably stolen - right after it had been catalogued. This may be the tomb of Jesus' brother James (see James Ossuary), although such claim is refuted by the professor who oversaw the archaeological work. Of the other nine, six were inscribed with names. As translated in The Lost Tomb of Jesus and The Jesus Family Tomb, they read as follows: *Ossuary #80/503 Y'shua bar Yosef ‚Äî Aramaic for \\"Jesus son of Joseph\\". *Ossuary #80/505 Maria ‚Äî written in Aramaic script, but a Latin form of the Hebrew name \\"Miriam\\" (\\"Mary\\") *Ossuary #80/504 Yose ‚Äî a diminutive of \\"Joseph\\" mentioned (in its Greek form ŒπœâœÉŒ∑œÇ \\"Joses\\") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament () *Ossuary #80/501 Yehuda bar Yeshua ‚Äî possibly Aramaic for \\"Judah son of Jesus\\". *Ossuary #80/500 Mariamene e Mara ‚Äî according to the filmmakers this is Greek for \\"Mary known as the master.\\" The similar name \\"Mariamne\\" is found in the Acts of Philip. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at Harvard University has said, based on his study of that work, \\"I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.\\"Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007 * Matya ‚Äî Hebrew for 'Matthew' ‚Äî not claimed to be Matthew the Evangelist but \\"possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary\\". The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew. The Tenth Ossuary The authors present a case for the ossuary of James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus (Yakov ben Yosef akhui diYeshua). This controversial relic, accepted as legitimate by some, is believed by others in the field as fraudulent. Prominent among those who believe its authenticity is Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archaeology Review. A forgery trial in Israel, instituted by the Israeli Antiquities Authority, failed to disprove its authenticity. The doubts are the result of the ossuary being unprovenanced - that is, not found in a legitimate excavation. The book presents what the authors purport to be firm scientific evidence that the James ossuary is the missing tenth ossuary from the Talpiot tomb. The film makers from The Lost Tomb of Jesus had the outside layer of dirt tested against the other 9 ossuaries that were found in the tomb, and the dirt on the outside of the James ossuary was proven to be made up of the same minerals as the other 9 ossuaries. In the documentary they stated that this was nearly impossible if not from the same tomb. However, Prof. Amos Kloner, who oversaw the archaeological work at Talpiot tomb, refutes the claim. According to Prof Kloner, the James Ossuary cannot be the missing 10th ossuary because the 10th ossuary had no inscription and had different dimensions. In fact, he has stated that the 10th ossuary was not missing at all. Controversy Not only are some of the names on the bone boxes relatively common names, but no writings of Jesus' life, canonical or apocryphal, reported a marriage or children. The authenticity of the nine remaining ossuaries, and of the names inscribed on them, is under no doubt or suspicion. However, the identities of these people are open to much controversy and debate. They are either nine otherwise unknown Jewish people from first- century Jerusalem, or Jesus himself and, presumably, eight members of his family. Recently, some of the scholars quoted in the Discovery Channel documentary have issued strong clarifications, backtracking on some of the central claims made in the film and book. Namely, University of Toronto statistician Professor Andrey Feuerverger, whose conservative statistical analysis claimed that the odds were 600:1 in favor of the tomb being the burial site of Jesus' family, has clarified his opinion, saying that these odds relate to the chances that these particular names would be found in one tomb, and not to the particular identification of individuals in the tomb.Jesus tomb film scholars backtrack  Jerusalem Post Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time. \\"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family,\\" he told the BBC News website. \\"The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film.\\" Following a symposium at Princeton in January 2008 the media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited with most notably TimeJesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened - TIME and CNNVideo - Breaking News Videos from CNN.com devoting extensive coverage, hailing the case as being re-opened. Following the media's portrayal scholars present at the symposium accused Simcha Jacobovici and James Cameron for misleading the media in claiming the symposium re-opened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including significantly several of the archaeologists and epigraphers, who had delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are \\"nothing further from the truth\\".Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited The list of scholars included: *Professor Jodi Magness, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill *Professor Eric M.

Von Ebner's glands, also called Ebner's glands or gustatory glands, are exocrine glands found in the mouth. More specifically, they are serous salivary glands which reside adjacent to the moats surrounding the circumvallate and foliate papillae just anterior to the posterior third of the tongue, anterior to the terminal sulcus. These glands are named after Victor von Ebner, an Austrian histologist. Von Ebner's glands secrete lingual lipase, beginning the process of lipid hydrolysis in the mouth. These glands empty their serous secretion into the base of the moats around the foliate and circumvallate papillae.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wheat was a farming community in Roane County, Tennessee. The area is now in the city of Oak Ridge. The earliest settlers moved into the area in the late 18th century. However, it was not until 1846 that the area was established as the community of Bald Hill. The name was changed to Wheat in 1880, when a post office was opened and the community took the name of its first postmaster, Frank Wheat. Early farming residents included John Henry and Elizabeth Inman Welcker. They owned Laurel Banks plantation on the Clinch River from the early 19th century until c. 1840. Records from the time show that the Welckers were active in the purchase and sale of slaves.Brief History of the Wheat Area, the Welckers, & the Gallahers George Hamilton Gallaher purchased the property in the 1840s, and it is now referred to as the Gallaher-Stone Plantation. The Wheat Community African Burial Ground (AEC #2) and Gallaher-Welcker Cemetery (AEC #1) still survive. The African Burial Ground was long forgotten, but the site was found in 2000 by Will Minter and was cleaned up and marked by U.S. Department of Energy personnel and volunteers. At least some of those buried in the African Burial Ground are believed to have been part of the Gallaher- Stone Plantation; a monument to those held in slavery is on the cemetery grounds.John Shearer, Slave cemetery registry intended to document more local black history, Knoxville News Sentinel, February 22, 2011 Wheat eventually included several churches, a seminary/college, several stores, a gas station and a Masonic lodge. Poplar Creek Seminary, founded in 1886 by a Presbyterian minister, later became Roane College. In 1908, the college transferred ownership of the building to Wheat High School.

It is a legal principle under the subject of the freedom of association. The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection. The National Labor Relations Act, the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section 7. > Section 7 - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, > join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through > representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted > activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or > protection...Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 157 Generally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected.Atlantic Steel, 245 N.L.R.B. 814, 816 (1979). Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved.Labor Board v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 14 (1962). At times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity.NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, 465 U.S. 822 (1984). On the other hand, an employee who acts as a \\"whistleblower\\" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).See Meyers Industries, Inc., 281 N.L.R.B. 882 (1986). The Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter are protected against retaliation.See Report of the Acting General Counsel Concerning Social Media Cases , OM 12-31 (Jan. 24, 2012).

The presbytery was strongly influenced by the Second Great Awakening and has an important place within the history of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Creation In 1786, Transylvania Presbytery was established from part of Abingdon Presbytery in the Synod of Virginia. Transylvania Presbytery originally encompassed all of Kentucky, settlements on the Cumberland River in Tennessee, and later the settlements on the Big and Little Miami Rivers in Ohio. The presbytery grew rapidly and in 1799 was divided into three smaller presbyteries. Transylvania Presbytery retained the area to the south and west of the Kentucky River in central Kentucky. West Lexington Presbytery covered the area of Kentucky between the Kentucky River and the Licking River. Washington Presbytery comprised the area northeast of the Licking River and north of the Ohio River. In 1802, these three presbyteries were separated from the Synod of Virginia to form the Kentucky Synod. One of the first actions of the Kentucky Synod was to form Cumberland Presbytery from the portion of Transylvania Presbytery south of the Salt River. Dissolution Cumberland Presbytery was the heart of the Second Great Awakening. Although ministers in support of the Revival of 1800 generally dominated the presbytery, the anti-revival faction dominated the Kentucky Synod. In 1806, differences between the presbytery and the synod over the revival, ordination standards for ministers, and the literal interpretation of the Westminster Confession of Faith resulted in Cumberland Presbytery being dissolved back into Transylvania Presbytery. The former members of Cumberland Presbytery fought for their position for a number of years in the hope that the Kentucky Synod would reconsider. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church agreed that the synod had made an error of judgement, but it took no action to reinstate Cumberland Presbytery. In 1810, the former members of Cumberland Presbytery reformed the presbytery as the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.

Background It is located between Broad and Walcot Streets, which both merge onto Northgate Street. Located next to the Post Office Building, the south tower (referred to as the W tower) fronts Northgate street and dominates Bath's skyline. The current structure was designed by George Phillips Manners. It possesses a fine example of a Sweetland Organ. The Church of St Michael's is known as St Michael's Without - it being the first church to be found outside the original city walls when exiting from the North Gate. The parish itself was known as St Michael's with St Paul's. In 2013, with the closure of Holy Trinity Church Queen's Square, the parish boundary grew as the two parishes were merged under St Michael's. At this time, the parish reverted to its original name of St Michael's Without. From Mondays to Saturdays, the church plays host to a cafe serving hot drinks, cakes and snacks. Clergy The Revd Martin Lloyd Williams was rector of St Michael's from 1997 until January 2015, when he left to become Archdeacon of Brighton and Lewes. There is currently an interregnum. In November 2015, it was announced that the Revd Roger Driver would become the new incumbent in 2016. Medieval Church The parish has been located here, outside the walls, since medieval times. It was outside the Northgate and would have been passed by wool merchants traveling on London Road. The area that would in Georgian times be called Bath New Town (not to be confused with neighboring Bathwick New Town) was known as St. Michael's. Georgian Church Designed and constructed by craftsmen J. Harvey between 1734 and 1742, the structure featured an impressive dome and was half the size of the current Victorian structure. Victorian Church ‚ÄúSt. Michael, Broad Street. At the sharp corner with Walcot Street and in the point de vue up Northgate Street. The church is of medieval original and lay originally ante muros. The present church is of 1835-7, by G. P. Manners. Its immediate predecessor dated from 1742 and had a dome (Collinson). Manner‚Äôs church displays a crazy W tower, tall and narrow with a huge group of three stepped lancet windowes, buttresses with the stepped-set offs of Wells, and at the top a tall octagonal open lantern with spire.

She is the oldest, most revered virgin martyr in the Normandy area of France but little is known of her. According to a tradition that exists in the diocese of Rouen, Honorina, a member of the Calates, was martyred during the persecutions of Diocletian.Borelli, 2002. The spot of her martyrdom is said to have been M√©lamare between Lillebonne and Harfleur. Her body was thrown into the Seine and would have drifted to Graville-Sainte-Honorine, where it was collected by Christians and buried in a tomb.Borelli, 2002. Another tradition holds that she was martyred at Coulonces. Other traditions place Honorina's martyrdom in the Pays d'Auge, where several villages bear her name. Relics In 876, with the coast threatened by the Normans, the monks guarding her relics moved them closer to the interior, at the confluence of the Seine and the Oise, placing them in the chapel associated with a fortress. On June 21, 1082, the castle of Conflans was destroyed during a siege. The monks therefore decided to build a church outside of the town walls, dedicated to Honorina. Her relics were transported solemnly in the presence of the bishop of Paris. The town to this day is called Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. Veneration The church of Sainte- Honorine. Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. A confraternity was founded in her honor in later years, and special indulgences associated with her cult were also approved. Saint Honorina is the patron saint of boatmen, since Conflans- Sainte-Honorine became a port of arrival for the tugs that travel on the rivers and canals of northern France.Borelli, 2002. Prisoners who were liberated thanks to the divine intercession of Saint Honorina brought their chains as an ex-voto.

Truck No. 25 history HT Motorsports made its NASCAR debut at New Hampshire International Speedway in 2001 as the No. 92 Learnframe Dodge. It made four starts that season with Stacy Compton and finished in the top ten in each race. The team then ran at Martinsville Speedway in 2002 as the No. 17 Duck Head Footwear Dodge Ram driven by Darrell Waltrip. He qualified eighteenth but finished thirty-eighth. Waltrip returned at Indianapolis Raceway Park with Tide sponsorship, and finished sixth. Stacy Compton would drive three additional races that season, posting a best finish of eighth at Richmond. In 2003, HT switched to the No. 59 and hired Robert Pressley to drive. Driving with associate sponsorship from Melling Engine Parts, Pressley finished in the top-five four times and finished thirteenth in points. Randy LaJoie ran the first two races of 2004, followed by rookie Mark McFarland. McFarland finished sixth at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway before being cycled out by LaJoie, who had an eighth- place finish at Gateway. Andy Houston drove for three races, but did not finish higher than 14th. Sammy Sanders, Bobby Hamilton, Jr., and Scott Lynch finished out the year in the 59. Pressley returned to HT in 2005, but had only three top-ten finishes and finished 20th in the standings. He was released and replaced by Mike Wallace at the beginning of 2006, but wrecked out of the two races in which he drove for the team. Steve Park became the team's new driver, as the team switched to Ford. Despite a tenth-place finish at Mansfield, he was released after ten races and replaced by Chad Chaffin. After a slow start, the team switched to Toyota and Chaffin finished eighth at Talladega Superspeedway. Terry Cook was named the driver of the 59 for 2007, and had two top-tens and finished fourteenth in points. He was released at the end of the season for Whelen Modified driver Donny Lia, who raced the last race of the season. For 2008, Ted Musgrave will move to the No. 59 team, bringing along his ASE sponsorship. In August 2008 ASE announced they will be leaving NASCAR.

It formerly operated a total of seven under the Joseph-Beth name and two under the Davis-Kidd Booksellers name. The name \\"Joseph-Beth\\" derives from the middle names of its two founders, Neil and Mary Beth Van Uum. They opened their first store in Lexington, Kentucky in November 1986. In 1989, they were recognized by the Greater Lexington Chamber of Commerce as the \\"1989 Small Business of the Year\\". In 1997, the company absorbed 4 Davis-Kidd Booksellers stores in Tennessee in Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis, and Jackson. The Knoxville store closed in 2000, but the Jackson bookstore remained open until 2006 . The Nashville and Memphis locations remained open until 2010 and continued to operate under the Davis-Kidd name. On November 11, 2010 Joseph- Beth filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed the Davis-Kidd location in Nashville, as well Joseph-Beth locations in Pittsburgh, Charlotte, and one of the two locations in Northeast Ohio. In May 2011, the company and three of its stores were purchased by the Lexington, Kentucky store's landlord. The Fredericksburg, Virginia Joseph-Beth and the Memphis, Tennessee Davis-Kidd locations were initially sold to a liquidator. However, Joseph-Beth founder Neil Van Uum was able to purchase the Memphis location with the financial backing of the Memphis landlord from the liquidators and continues to operate the store as The Booksellers at Laurelwood, as the Davis-Kidd name was purchased in the bankruptcy auction. The remaining three Joseph-Beth locations‚ÄîLexington, Cincinnati and the Cleveland Clinic specialty store‚Äîremain in operation under the new owner. On November 14, 2011 Joseph- Beth opened their fourth location at Crestview Hills Town Center in Crestview Hills, Kentucky.

Biography George Newman was born in Leominster, Herefordshire, the fourth of six children of Henry Stanley Newman and Mary Anna Pumphrey. His father was a Quaker who undertook several missionary journeys, including one to India, and edited The Friend, a Quaker journal. Newman was educated at two Quaker schools, Sidcot School in North Somerset (1881‚Äì1885) and Bootham School in York (1885‚Äì1887). He initially planned to become a missionary, but then decided to study medicine, starting at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and continuing at King's College London. After qualifying he studied for his M.D. at Edinburgh, receiving the gold medal for his year, before winning a scholarship to study public health and gaining his Diploma in Public Health in 1895 from the University of Cambridge. He became a demonstrator in bacteriology and lecturer in infectious diseases at King's. In 1900 he became Medical Officer to the Borough of Finsbury in inner London and the rural county of Bedfordshire. His experiences in these posts led him to publish Infant Mortality: a Social Problem in 1906. This has remained a medical classic, pointing out the unchanged infant mortality rate over the preceding fifty years, and identifying the causes and areas potentially open to intervention. He was Gresham Professor of Physic. In 1907 he was appointed by Sir Robert Morant, Permanent Secretary to the Board of Education, as Chief Medical Officer to the Board, and in 1919 he was also appointed Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health. The annual reports he wrote for both these posts were widely acclaimed as important and influential. Family In August 1898 he married Adelaide Constance Thorp (d.1946), who was an artist. They had no children. They lived at Harrow Weald after he retired in 1935. He died in 1948 at The Retreat, York. Quaker Born into a Quaker family, he remained a committed Christian throughout his life. From 1899, for some forty years, he was the (anonymous) editor of the Friends' Quarterly Examiner, a Quaker journal. In autumn 1914 he was involved in the establishment of the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which provided medical care for soldiers and civilians in the war zone, and following the introduction of conscription in 1916 he helped to negotiate exemptions for Quakers already serving with the FAU. Education In 1923 Newman was invited to address the centenary celebrations of his old school, Bootham. He referred to Alcuin, an eighth century educator and deacon whose three guiding principles were: holy living and holy learning; teaching understanding rather than repetition; and, finally, that education should be 'wisely and liberally furnished'. Newman believed that Quaker schools such as Bootham embodied these principles. He maintained an interest in medical education, and in 1923 he wrote Recent Advances in Medical Education. Public health His initial contribution, Infant Mortality: a Social Problem, was the forerunner of many writings about public health which proved respected and influential, including: Hygiene and Public Health in 1917, Outline of the Practice of Preventative Medicine in 1919, The Rise of Preventative Medicine in 1932, and The Building of the Nation‚Äôs Health in 1939. His annual reports as the Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health were eagerly awaited each year, and were widely regarded as authoritative monographs on a variety of aspects of this field.

It operated continuously from 1920 to 1997.  First broadcast  The four Locos de la Azotea After returning to Argentina from Europe in 1919, the radio pioneer Enrique Tel√©maco Susini started working on the conversion of an old circus site into the Teatro Coliseo theater. Together with his friends Miguel Mugica, Cesar Guerrico and Luis Romero Carranza, he started planning for a radio transmission from there, strongly supported by the two Italian owners, Faustino da Rossa and Walter Mocchi. During 1920, while the group was working on the project, news reached them of Marconi's successful broadcast of a concert in New York City that had taken place on May 19. Even though it was somewhat of a disappointment that their broadcast would not be the world's first, the preparations continued at a rapid pace. On August 27, they were finally ready. The theatre was showing the opera Parsifal by Richard Wagner. Susini and his coworkers had set up a 5W transmitter on the roof using a RS-5 Telefunken tube, operating in 350m,Revista Telegr√°fica, May 1923 along with a wire antenna connected to the dome on top of a neighboring building. To pick up the sound in the theater, they used a microphone originally designed to aid people with hearing loss. Around 8:30 pm, Susini himself took the microphone and inaugurated regular radio broadcast service in Argentina with the words: The transmission continued for about three hours and was received as far as Santos in Brazil, where it was picked up by a ship's radio operator. The number of listeners was limited, since the crystal set radios used at the time were rare and difficult to operate, requiring tedious fine-tuning of a lead glass crystal and installation of a wire antenna several meters long. But the newspaper La Raz√≥n published a raving review, and even president Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen commended Susini and his group for their accomplishment.  Radio Argentina  During the next 19 days, the group continued to broadcast from the theater, transmitting mostly Italian operas such as Verdi's Aida and Rigoletto. After the season at the Teatro Coliseo was over, they started creating productions under their own name. By now they officially called their station \\"Radio Argentina\\". Radio Argentina would continue broadcasting until its demise on December 31, 1997. At first, it was run solely by the four friends. The polyglot Susini himself performed songs in Spanish, French, German, Italian and Russian, assuming a different stage name each time so the listeners would not notice. During the following years, radio broadcasting in Argentina saw a quick expansion. In 1921, Buenos Aires mayor Juan Barnetche introduced official broadcasting licenses. In the same year, Radio Club Argentina was founded, becoming the first such association on American soil. In October 1922, Radio Argentina broadcast live from the inauguration of president Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, an historic first. Two months later, the first competitors arrived - Italian-owned Corporaci√≥n Argentina de Radio Sud Am√©rica, Radio Brusa and Radio Cultura, all three founded within an interval of three days. In 1924, the radio industry in Argentina went through a brief crisis, during which Radio Argentina had to be financially supported by an association of industrialists named Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Broadcasting. While competitor Radio Sud Am√©rica went into bankruptcy, and was taken over by Radio Argentina, Radio Argentina itself survived, even though it had to briefly adopt the name of its benefactors. The station now broadcast from the famous Teatro Col√≥n opera as well as from the (Tango-) Club Abdullah, and other venues. Adding to the variety of the schedule was Argentina's first regular radio journal. 1925 saw the introduction of mandatory callsigns for radio stations, and from now on the station was known as LOR Radio Argentina (changed 1934 into LR2 Radio Argentina, it being the second station on the dial from the left). It also entered a collaboration with the daily newspaper Cr√≠tica, remaining under the direction of Susini and his friends but adopting the name \\"LOR Broadcasting de Cr√≠tica\\". This arrangement lasted a little more than a year, before the station returned to its original name and ownership. The station closed on January 1, 1997, after a religious show. This was due to economic problems caused by a bad administration.

He was born in Hominy, Oklahoma. Biography Grove was the son of a Kansas cowboy and an Osage-Lakota woman born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. His great- grandfather, Henry Chatillon, guided Francis Parkman on his tour of the Great Plains, from which evolved the classic book, The Oregon Trail. Grove was provoked into writing at an early age. The ten-year-old boy was visiting relatives in Fairfax, Oklahoma, when a wealthy Indian woman's house exploded, killing her and two family members. The novelist graphically recalled details the 1923 murder conspiracy to appropriate the woman's money. Grove's mother was Osage and Lakota, which thrust the tragedy into sharper focus. He remembers \\"the situation was lawless, with county officials apparently doing little to bring the guilty to justice.\\" A subsequent FBI investigation resulted in prison sentences for two white men, one a cattleman and leading citizen of Fairfax ‚Äî the other the son-in-law of the murdered woman. He remembered, \\"Those were years of fear in Osage County,\\" he said, \\"of rumors and threats. As a boy this intrigued me, angered me. I wanted to write about it someday, and air those wrongs.\\" A number of years later, Grove met the FBI agent who directed the investigation, and they collaborated on a non-fiction book about the incident, but were unable to find a publisher. \\"It was very discouraging. I spent a year reading state newspapers on microfilm.\\" The result of his extensive research were two novels, Warrior Road and Drum Without Warriors. The first novel was written from a Native American's point of view, the second from an FBI agent posing as a racehorse owner looking for match races, which sparked Grove's latent interest in quarterhorse racing. He also penned Apache novels, which he has continued to write into his 90s. Determined to write, Grove earned his B.A. degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma, class of 1937, where he was a sports editor of the student daily newspaper during his senior year. He later served as sports editor for two dailies before drifting into general news and desk work. \\"It was during the Depression and you felt lucky to have a job,\\" he said. \\"My first one paid $18 a week and I was glad to have it.\\" Grove had attempted to write westerns after World War II, and interviewed \\"a lot of Oklahoma pioneers\\" while working as a reporter for the Shawnee Morning News. \\"They were wonderful old people who had made the land runs in that state and remembered the 1870s and 80s. This further spurred my interest in the West.\\" He sold his first short story, \\"The Hangman Ghost\\" to .44 Western Magazine in 1951, and taught beginning reporting at the University of Oklahoma as well as a public relations course. There he took creative writing classes from Foster Harris and Walter Campbell (aka Stanley Vestal). He later served as public information director of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority \\"until the politicians got hold of OETA, demanding that the staff perform like trained seals.\\" Grove quit his job and considered it the best career move he ever made. He then wrote his Osage novels and got into quarter horse racing. Flame of the Osage, his first novel, was sold when he was 45 and he said, his writing was more habit than compulsion. \\"I enjoy writing when I have a feel for the story. Writing hard takes a lot out of you. The finished novel is the real reward for me, a feeling of great relief.\\" Quarter horse racing became the subject of three of Grove's most successful books: The Great Horse Race, Bush Track, and Match Race. The first and last of these won awards. Notable among Grove's later fiction is the series of five Jesse Wilder novels set during and after the American Civil War: Bitter Trumpet, Trail of Rogues, Man on a Red Horse, Into the Far Mountains, and A Soldier Returns.

Origin of Name  This name appears as early as 1675 in The English Pilot, a guide to navigation. At the time, Basques were called \\"Biscayans\\", and the bay was used by the early Basque fishermen.The Basque History of the World, Mark Kurlansky, 1999,  History  There is very little known about Biscay Bay before 1845, but most of the land area of Biscay Bay was owned by William D. Jackson, an English merchant, when Thomas Ryan of Trepassey (originally from Ireland) went to live there in that year. Other families at the time were the Easemans and Whites.  Economy  The census of 1857 shows Biscay Bay with of improved land producing 20 barrels of potatoes and three tons of hay. When Jackson died, his daughter Caroline decided to go back to live in England so she sold the land to Thomas Ryan and Richard Hartery for 150 pounds. Residents farmed root crops and hay, raised sheep, cattle and pigs and also fished for cod inshore. It was not until the early 1930s that the road made much difference to the community and most transportation was by water. The community averaged 600 quintals of saltfish annually in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but 1943 was a good year when 970 quintals were made and sold for $12.50 per quintal. Very heavy timber grew along the shore of Path End but as the years went by, it became necessary to go farther and farther inland to get wood. Today, Biscay Bay is almost void of trees. The area boasted abundant partridge berries, bakeapples, rabbits, partridges, eider duck, fox, beaver, muskrat and weasel. The coming of the branch railway in 1913 added extra impetus to the area, as it had a sawmill in 1920.  Family  The principal names were Ryan, White, Coombs and Shea.

Biography  Memory plaque The son of the Dean of Jersey, George Orange Balleine, and the brother of Robert Wilfred Balleine and Cuthbert Francis Balleine, George Reginald Balleine was born in Bletchingdon, Oxfordshire, and was educated by his father at home until 1885, when he went to stay with his grandfather in Jersey. There he attended the Grammar School at St Aubin until 1886, when he went to Victoria College. During his time there he gained the Queen's History Prize. He left in 1891, going to Queen's College, Oxford, and gaining a 2nd class degree in Modern History. In 1886, he was ordained a deacon in the Church of England, and the 1897, a priest. He was Curate at St Mary's Whitechapel, then St Paul's, Penge. He became the Metropolitan Secretary to the Church Pastoral Aid Society in 1904, the Vicar of St James, Bermondsey in 1908. In 1925, he was also appointed Rural Dean of Bermondsey. He remained there until his retirement in 1938, when he returned to Jersey to property inherited from his uncle. During the German Occupation, he was honorary librarian at the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise, curate at St Aubin on the Hill church, and Ministre Desservant at St Brelade's Church on the death of his cousin, the Rev. J.A. Balleine, in 1942, in which position he remained for the duration of the war. He died in 1966. His ashes were interred in St Brelade's Churchyard.  Writings  Balleine's writings were extensive, and mirrored his interests in history, and the evangelical party of the Church of England. = Theological = Despite his evangelical roots, he was no fundamentalist, taking a very liberal position on the miracle stories of the New Testament. Writing (in Simon Whom he Surnamed Peter) of the feeding of the five thousand that \\"where the bread came from, no one can say, but it seems unlikely that it was supernaturally multiplied\\", and of Jesus walking on the water, he takes it that the Fourth Gospel tells of Jesus walking by the sea, the story changing in the telling. * Simon Whom He Surnamed Peter * The Layman's History of the Church of England * A History of the Evangelical Party in the Church of England * Children of the Church * The Young Churchman * Sing with Understanding * Past Finding Out (The Story of Joanna Southcott) = Jersey History = His knowledge of Jersey history, gleaned from his time as Honorary Librarian for the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise, was extensive. However, his reliance upon the documents available at the time have led to weaknesses in some areas. These are notably his 1939 article on Witchcraft in Jersey (ABSB), where he draws heavily upon the now discredited ideas of Margaret Murray in his selection and presentation, and on the Reformation in Jersey, where historian Jason St. John Nicolle has criticised his position as oversimplifying the complexities of that period. Nevertheless, his work has provided a solid bedrock for later historians of the Island to build upon, and his Biographical Dictionary of Jersey remains unsurpassed for its depth of research.

Currently, the fair hosts approximately half a million people per year, and is the second largest county Fair in New York State.  History  The Dutchess County Agricultural Society, formed in 1841, first organized the fair in 1842 at Washington Hollow in Pleasant Valley, New York. The fair was mainly started as an old-fashioned agricultural event in which farmers would come and show off their livestock, crops, and tools with a popular event being a plow competition. The fair initially alternated between Washington Hollow and Poughkeepsie before moving to Springbrook Park in Rhinebeck in 1919. The move was made following financial issues in the early 1900s and the subsequent cancellations of the 1916 and 1918 fairs. The Society faced heavy debt in the Depression era after the cancellations of the 1927 and 1928 fairs due to flooding. The fair was also cancelled in 1942 due to WWII, but a financial upturn in the late 1940s allowed the Society to repay its debt and acquired the Springbrook Park land renaming it to the Dutchess County Fairgrounds. The fair closed early in 2011 due to Hurricane Irene. Recent additions to the fairgrounds include the restored Pleasant Valley Train Station. Besides 1916, 1918, 1927‚Äì28 & 1942, it was also cancelled in 2020 on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic.

The upper deck gangway is offset to one side of the vehicle, normally the offside (or driver's side), and is sunken into the lower deck passenger saloon. Low railway bridges and overpasses are the main reason that a reduced height is desired. Origins The lowbridge design was introduced and patented by Leyland in 1927 on their Titan TD1 chassis. Early examples were delivered to Glasgow Corporation amongst other operators. One of the Glasgow vehicles is preserved at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum, Lathalmond, Fife. Disadvantages Preserved Bristol Lodekka FS6G A major disadvantage of this layout was the inconvenient seating layout, with four-abreast seats upstairs making it difficult for passengers to manoeuvre past each other if those farthest from the gangway needed to alight first. A second disadvantage was the restricted headroom for passengers on the offside of the lower deck, as a result of the encroachment of the upper deck gangway. It was often the case that passengers would bump their heads on it when standing up to alight. Alternatives The sharply- arched Beverley Bar necessitated a special bus design At first, there was no viable alternative to the lowbridge design, apart from the use of single- decker bus. However, the lowbridge type started to become obsolete when low- height chassis were developed, which used a dropped-center rear axle to enable the lower deck gangway to be lowered. That enabled a low-height vehicle to be built without the need for the cumbersome seating layout upstairs. The first such design was the Bristol Lodekka, which was introduced by Bristol in 1949. It had a height of around compared to a typical height of around for a conventional highbridge double-decker. It was, however, available to only nationalised bus companies (Bristol itself being part of the state-owned sector at that time). Other low-height double-deckers included the Dennis Loline (a version of the Bristol Lodekka built under licence); the AEC Bridgemaster and Renown; and the Albion Lowlander (a low-height version of the Leyland Titan PD3). The rear-engined Daimler Fleetline and Bristol VR were also low-height chassis. Nonetheless, despite the advent of the low-height chassis, the last lowbridge double-decker was not built until 1968. When the rear-engined Leyland Atlantean was first introduced in 1958, it did not have a dropped-centre rear axle, even though the prototype had featured one. As a result, some Atlanteans were built to a \\"semi-lowbridge\\" layout, with the front half of the upper deck laid out conventionally, and a side gangway with raised seating area towards the rear. A special situation existed in Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where buses had to pass under the arched structure of Beverley Bar. To facilitate, East Yorkshire Motor Services had a number of double-deckers built with special roofs of severely-arched profile to match the shape of the arch.photo of East Yorkshire AEC bus WAT 652 with Beverley Bar shaped roof Similarly North Western ordered a number of single- decker buses with an unusual roof profile to clear a very low road bridge under the Bridgewater Canal at Dunham Massey. The buses also had smaller wheels than normal buses. Notable vehicles Barton's unique Dennis Loline, 861 A notable lowbridge bus is Barton Transport's no. 861, registered 861 HAL. It is unique in combining a low-height chassis (Dennis Loline II) with lowbridge bodywork, built by Northern Counties. With the combined effect of both these height reduction techniques, the height of the vehicle is less than , which remains the lowest ever for a British closed-top double-decker. The last lowbridge double-decker to be built was bought by Bedwas and Machen UDC, a small municipal bus fleet in south Wales, in 1968. It is a Leyland Titan PD3 with bodywork built by Massey of Wigan, and is registered PAX 466F. Following its sale by B&MUDC;'s successor, Rhymney Valley District Council, it was operated by Stevensons of Uttoxeter and subsequently by MK Metro of Milton Keynes.

Wandering spleen is also called displaced spleen, drifting spleen, splenoptosis, floating spleen, or splenic ptosis. Symptoms and signs Symptoms include an enlargement in the size of the spleen, or a change from the spleen's original position to another location, usually in either other parts of the abdomen or into the pelvis. This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleen's pedicle being abnormally long. Physical factors may cause ischuria, constipation, as well as numerous spleen-related diseases such as hypersplenism, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoma. Blocking of the arteries and torsion in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling. However, lack of visible symptoms ‚Äî except in incidents of abdominal pain ‚Äî makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose, though medical imaging techniques such as medical ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography can be used to confirm its occurrence. Characteristics of the disorder include the loss, weakening, or malformation of the ligaments that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the abdomen. Cause Though not a genetic disease, wandering spleen is often found at birth. It can occur in adults as the result of injuries and other similar conditions that cause the ligaments to weaken, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy. Wandering spleen (splenoptosis) predisposes the spleen to complications such as torsion, splenic infarction, pancreatic necrosis and rarely pseudocyst formation. Diagnosis Treatment The usual treatment is splenopexy, fixation of the spleen, but if there is no blood flow after unwinding the spleen through detorsion then splenectomy must be performed. Although there have been few reported cases of treatment through laparoscopic surgery due to the rarity of the disease, it has been proven to be an effective surgical technique. Prevalence Wandering spleen is most commonly diagnosed in young children as well as women between the ages of 20 and 40. Even so, the disease is very rare and fewer than 500 occurrences of the disease have been reported as of 2005, of which around 148 (including both children and adult cases) were documented to have been from between 1960 and 1992. Less than 0.5% of all splenectomies, surgical removal of the spleen, are performed due to having this disorder. In 1992, the youngest case of the literature of torsion of wandering spleen at two days of birth was reported in Lebanon, by Dr Edouard Sayad. Culture Susan Mayer on the TV show Desperate Housewives had an operation to fix her wandering spleen in Season 2 of the show.

Career  After graduating as a silver medallist at the Guildhall School of Music, Parker played with leading London orchestras and chamber groups as well as being a key part of The Barrow Poets for whom he provided both original instrumental music and music to accompany the performance of a wide range of poetry spoken or sung by the rest of the band. This music was played on a variety of instruments including the bass cacacofiddle, a home made sort of double bass with knobs on, played by William Bealby-Wright, while Parker mostly played oboe and cor anglais.. Parker subsequently concentrated on composing and conducting. He had early success with a series of recordings in which he set the poems of the British Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman to music; Banana Blush, Late Flowering Love (both 1974), Sir John Betjeman's Britain (1977) and Varsity Rag (1981). The albums, in which the poet recited his own words and the composer conducted a small group of musicians, have continued to be held in high regard by listeners and critics. These and subsequent records, including Captain Beaky, with words by Jeremy Lloyd, which topped the charts as both a single and album, led to work in television as well as in London West End theatres, where Parker has had three musicals produced. The most successful of these was \\"Follow the Star\\", with book and lyrics by Wally K Daly. It was originally produced at Chichester and was directed by Wendy Toye.  Film and television  Film scores include music for numerous feature-length television films and for new prints of the classic silent films Girl Shy, by Harold Lloyd, and The Blot, a 1921 film directed by Lois Weber. He has won the British Academy Award for Best Original Television Music four times, and has written scores for over two hundred programmes. His work in film and television ranges from music for Moll Flanders, Tom Jones, Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War, The House of Eliott, and Mapp and Lucia to the score for the contemporary political thrillers House of Cards (UK version) and To Play The King. The opening and closing theme music for those TV series is entitled \\"Francis Urquhart's March.\\" With Tom Stanier he wrote the music for schools programmes such as Watch, Zig Zag and Fourways Farm plus musicals such as Blast Off: Mr Jones Goes To Jupiter.  Concert works  Concert works have been written for the Nash Ensemble, Philip Jones Brass, The Hilliard Ensemble, The Albion Ensemble, The Wallace Collection and Poems on the Underground. His published compositions include \\"A Londoner in New York\\" for brass, \\"Mississippi Five\\" for wind quintet, \\"The Golden Section\\" for brass quintet, and a clarinet concerto.

A gateway is the collection of hardware and software required to interconnect two or more disparate networks, including performing protocol conversion.Webster's New World Telecom Dictionary Copyright ¬© 2010 by Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana. http://computer.yourdictionary.com/gateway What is a USSD Gateway? A USSD Gateway routes USSD messages from the signaling network to a service application and back. A \\"USSD gateway\\" service is also called a \\"USSD center\\". USSD Gateway is based upon the ability of the delivery agent or the source to send and receive USSD messages. A USSD is a session-based protocol. USSD messages travel over GSM signaling channels and are used to query information and trigger services. Unlike similar services (SMS and MMS), which are store and forward based, USSD establishes a real time session between mobile handset and application handling the service =Difference between USSD and other Gateways= The difference between USSD Gateways and other messaging gateways is that USSD gateways maintain a single interactive session once the connection is established. SMS and MMS store and forward messages independently of the user session, similar to the way email is sent over the internet. Modular Operation # Session Module : As per directions from the SS7 (Signaling System 7) protocol stack‚Äôs MAP (Mobile Application Part), it receives and sends out session IDs from the session ID pool, and maintains and destroys the sessions. # MAP layer: Mobile Application Part is present both on the server and on the MS. # Gateway: A Gateway will wait for messages from the MAP layer and work to route these messages into SMPP protocol which is then delivered to the server applications. This is the most important operation, and this is the reason why USSDs are primarily used, as it helps to directly connect users to applications like bill checking and others. # Locator: This tries to find out the current cell and relays it to the Gateway. Then the messages are routed using Routing Numbers. # Home Location Register: This is the home zone where the given cell phone‚Äôs number is registered in the database. This is different from the Visitor Location Register which is where the user is roaming. #The reason why USSD is commonly used is because it enhances the WCDMA signalling and multiplexes the coherent signals. Types of Applications: * Balance Check: The user can send a Process Supplementary Service request (PSSR) to the home zone which will forward this, under guidance from the Gateway, to the correct application. Then, the application sends an acknowledgement via USSD Gateway, HLR etc. known as PSSR response back to the user. Balance Notification at the end of charged call can also be given using Unstructured Supplementary Service Notify (USSN) message. * Voice Chat: Using the same process as above, one can use voice chat. This is highly useful when VoIP enabled phones are not available. * Advertising: The application can advertise their product using USSD which is less invasive than telemarketing. * Roaming: This has huge advantages while roaming. This is because USSD services are well available in roaming networks and all the USSD messages are directed towards the subscriber's Home Network itself, thus, same set of services that are available in home network can be given in visited network too, giving subscribers a Virtual Home Environment (VHE). Apart from PSSR and USSN, there is another method called Unstructured Supplementary Service Request (USSR) message that initiates a session by USSD Gateway to a Mobile User. This message can be used in conjunction with USSR initiated session to provide session based services like Menu services through USSD. Also, in the earlier phases of MAP (Mobile Application Part), PSSR message was called PSSD (PSS Data). =Notes= References # \\"SS7 Protocol Architecture,\\" Lee Dryburgh & Jeff Hewett, Third Edition.

It lies on a windswept plain some 6 km (3.7 mi) from Jamestown. History Longwood \\"was originally a farm belonging to the East India Company and was afterwards given as a country residence to the Deputy-Governor.\\"Wiliam Hazlitt, Life of Napoleon, volume 6 p.13. Grolier edition. It was converted for the use of Napoleon in 1815. The British government eventually recognised its inadequacy as a home for the former Emperor and his entourage and, by the time of his death, had built a new house for him nearby, which he never occupied. In February 1818, Governor Sir Hudson Lowe proposed to Lord Bathurst to move Napoleon to Rosemary Hall, a house that became available and was located in a more hospitable part of the island, sheltered from the winds and shaded, as Napoleon had preferred.Albert Benhamou, L'autre Sainte-H√©l√®ne: la captivit√©, la maladie, la mort, et les m√©decins autour de Napol√©on, 2010, p.138, extract from the Lowe Papers But the revelations of General Gourgaud in London brought Lord Bathurst to the opinion that it was safer to keep Napoleon at Longwood, where an escape was harder to undertake. The building of the new house only began in October 1818, three years after Napoleon's arrival on the island. The will written by Napoleon at Longwood House is preserved in French National Archives. Napoleon's Last Will (1821) =After Napoleon's death= Following Napoleon's death, Longwood House reverted to the East India Company and later to the Crown, and was used for agricultural purposes. Reports of its neglect reached Napoleon III who, from 1854, negotiated with the British government for its transfer to France. In 1858 it was transferred to the French government, along with the Valley of the Tomb for a sum of ¬£7,100. Since then they have been under the control of the French Foreign Ministry and a French government representative has lived on the island and has been responsible for managing both properties. In 1959 a third property, The Briars, where Napoleon spent the first two months while Longwood was being prepared, was given to the French government by Dame Mabel Brookes. As a result of the depredations of termites, in the 1940s the French government considered demolishing the building. New Longwood and the Balcombe's house at The Briars were both demolished at this time, but Longwood House was saved, and it has been restored by recent French curators. The stone steps at the front are the only part of the original fabric to survive. In 2006 Michel Dancoisne-Martineau donated the heart-shaped waterfall valley to the Saint Helena National Trust. In 2008 he donated the land surrounding the pavilion at The Briars to the French republic. Longwood House is now a museum owned by the French government. It is one of two museums on the island, the other being the Museum of Saint Helena.St Helena ‚Äî The Island in the South Atlantic Ocean .

Perkins is the president of InnerSight. He served as president of Towson University from July 2001 to April 2002. Education Perkins earned a doctorate in psychometrics and statistics from the University of Georgia in 1976. He received his master's in psychometrics and research design from the same institution in 1974. Perkins earned a bachelor's degree from St. Andrews Presbyterian College in 1972. Towson University Perkins briefly served a controversial tenure as president of Towson University from July 2001 to April 2002. He resigned after three members of the University System of Maryland Board of Regents, including the chairman, told him in a meeting that he would be fired if he did not step down, according to a four-page letter he posted on Towson's website. In the letter, Perkins stated the spending included improvements for coping with handicap accessibility as well as \\"family health issues\\" and for making the home a suitable place to entertain prospective donors. The regents were aware these improvements were necessary prior to selecting Perkins. The university received approval from the regents to buy a six-bedroom mansion in northern Baltimore for $850,000. The university subsequently spent $860,000 on renovations, but $360,000 more had been allocated to complete renovations and provide furnishings for the public spaces of the university home as well. Perkins claimed Towson officials were unaware of flaws in the home when the university bought it. Workers subsequently found deteriorating wall coverings, unabated lead paint and asbestos. Perkins said in his letter that he was not involved in many of the spending decisions on the home, including $279,000 for an elevator and $25,000 for a multimedia system. However, Perkins wrote, he took \\"full responsibility\\" for controversies including the spending on those renovations, which dominated discussions with the Board of Regents ahead of his resignation. There was also an inauguration ceremony held using funds raised specifically for the event, which reportedly cost $56,000. In his letter, Perkins said he had agreed to the event because \\"it was designed to celebrate not me or my arrival, but instead, the 135 years of commitment to learning on the Towson campus.\\" The Baltimore Sun reported that similar concerns about excessive spending by Perkins were raised at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìGreen Bay, where he was president before coming to Towson. Perkins had pushed for $630,000 in improvements to the president's house on that campus to make it acceptable for parties, but he rarely entertained guests of the university in the house, The Sun reported. Perkins also sparked controversy when the university spent $25,000 on a university medal symbolizing the president's office. All funds used for the inauguration and the medallion were raised for those purposes by a committee charged with organizing the inaugural events.

It is the story of Asher Witherow, a boy born in the coal mining town of Nortonville, California in 1863. The story is framed as a memoir of sorts, penned by the elderly Witherow in the spring of 1950, long after the book's events occurred, and many years after the community of Nortonville ceased to exist. Witherow, a mysterious and haunted old man of 86, shares the troubling story of his life from birth to age 20, when he left Nortonville. Central to the tale is the image of the 4,000 foot Mount Diablo, which assumes a symbolic presence for Witherow. The book's title is inspired by the poem \\"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\\" by Dylan Thomas, which begins: > \\"The force that through the green fuse drives the flower / Drives my green > age; that blasts the roots of trees / Is my destroyer.\\" The poem's central themes of mortality, biological decay, and ecological interdependence are explored in the novel.

She played camogie at various times with her local clubs, St Paul's camogie club based in Kilkenny city and Lisdowney, and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1970 until 1994. Downey is regarded as the greatest player in the history of the game. Downey's reputation as one of the all-time greats of camogie is self-evident. In a senior inter-county career that lasted for a quarter of a century she won twelve All-Ireland medals, thirteen Leinster medals and eight National League medals. With her two clubs St. Paul's and Lisdowney she collected a huge haul of twenty-two county titles and six All-Ireland club medals. Downey was also presented with a number of personal awards during her career. In 1977 she was honoured with the B&I; Player of the Year Award. Almost a decade later in 1986 Downey became only the third camogie player ever to be presented with a Texaco Award. In 2004 her reputation as the greatest player of all-time was further cemented when she was named on the Camogie Team of the Century. Biography Angela Downey was born in Kilkenny in 1957. From a young age camogie was a central part of her life, as well as the life of her twin sister Ann. Their father Shem Downey won an All-Ireland medal with Kilkenny in 1947. Angela started playing camogie when she was nine years-old and, in time, she would go on to become one of the best players in the history of the game. Playing career =Club= Downey played most of her club camogie with the famed St Paul‚Äôs Camogie Club, Kilkenny. When the club disbanded in the early 1990s she had already collected a huge haul of twenty county titles. During this period Downey won six All- Ireland club titles, the first of which came in 1970. She won the last of her six All-Ireland club medals nineteen years later in 1989. She later joined the Lisdowney club and enjoyed further success. Together with her twin-sister Ann she won a further two county medals. =Inter-county= Downey was a mere thirteen years-old when she first played senior camogie with Kilkenny in 1970. Two years later in 1972 she was a key member of the team and she lined out in her first championship decider. Cork provided the opposition and it was 'the Rebel' ladies who captured a 2‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì4 victory. Two years later in 1974 Kilkenny were back in the All-Ireland final and, once again, Cork were the opponents. After an exciting game both sides ended level with Kilkenny scoring 3‚Äì8 and Cork scoring 4‚Äì5. The replay took place a few weeks later and another tense game ensued. Kilkenny sneaked the victory by 3‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì5 and Downey captured her first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny surrendered their All-Ireland crown in 1975, however, Downey lined out in a third All-Ireland final in 1976. On that occasion Kilkenny took on Dublin. A close game followed with neither side taking a definite lead. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the winners by 0‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì2. It was Downey's second All-Ireland medal. In 1977 Downey had the honour of captaining Kilkenny in their quest for back-to-back All-Ireland titles. That year she guided her county to the All-Ireland final once again. It was an exciting occasion as Wexford, the winners of the championship two years earlier, provided the opposition. Kilkenny, however, had a relatively easy victory on a score line of 3‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì3. Not only was it Downey's third All-Ireland medal but she also had the honour of collecting the O'Duffy Cup. She was later chosen as the B&I; Player of the Year. Kilkenny went into decline for the next few years; however, Downey added a National Camogie League medal to her collection in 1980. It was Kilkenny's first title in that competition. This victory acted as a launch pad for further All- Ireland success. In 1981 Kilkenny squared up against Cork in the championship decider. After an exciting game both sides ended with 3‚Äì9 apiece. The replay was not as exciting, however, it was more conclusive, Kilkenny won that game by 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì7 with Downey collecting a fourth All-Ireland medal. All-Ireland success was slow in coming over the next few years; however, Downey won a second National League medal with Kilkenny in 1982. Three years later in 1985 she collected a third winners' medal in that competition. Kilkenny later qualified for another All-Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion; however, they faced a Kilkenny team that was on the verge of dominating camogie for the bones of the next decade. The final ended with a 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì5 victory for 'the Cats', giving her a fifth All-Ireland medal. 1986 saw Kilkenny line out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final, her sixth in all. For the second year in-a-row Dublin provided the opposition, however, once again the result was the same. Kilkenny were much too strong for 'the Dubs' and won the game by 2‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì3. It was Downey's sixth All-Ireland title. She was later presented with a Texaco Award, thus becoming only the third camogie player ever to win one. In 1987 Downey added a fourth National League medal to her collection after Kilkenny got the better of Dublin in yet another national final. Later that year Kilkenny qualified for the All-Ireland final. It was an historic occasion as Downey's side were hoping to capture a third All-Ireland title in-a-row, something that Kilkenny had never achieved. Cork stood in their way, however, Kilkenny gave a great performance in the final. The full-time score of 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì7 gave Kilkenny the victory and gave Downey a seventh All-Ireland medal. In 1988 Downey had the honour of captaining Kilkenny once again. It would turn out to be a hugely successful year for Kilkenny once again. She began the year by winning a fifth National League medal before later guiding her county to the All-Ireland final once again, against Cork. The game was a high scoring affair, however, Kilkenny won relatively easily in the end by 4‚Äì11 to 3‚Äì8. It was Downey's eighth All- Ireland medal while she also joined an exclusive club of player that had captained their county to more than one All-Ireland victory. In 1989 no county was able to match Kilkenny's hunger and desire for camogie success. Cork fell in the National League final to give Kilkenny and Downey a sixth title in that competition. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a repeat of the championship deciders of the previous two years. Cork were out to avenge those defeats and avoid losing a third All-Ireland final in-a-row, while Kilkenny were hoping to add another consecutive title to their huge collection. The result was a decisive one with Kilkenny winning the day by 3‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì6, giving Downey a ninth All-Ireland medal. 1990 saw Downey and Kilkenny continue their winning ways. At the start of the year the county annexed a fourth consecutive National League title. It was Downey's seventh medal in that competition. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Wexford for the first time since 1977. Kilkenny dominated the game from start to finish and completely overwhelmed their near neighbours and rivals. The final score of 1‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì7 gave Downey her tenth All-Ireland medal on the field of play, a victory which made her joint third with Kay Ryder on the all-time list of leading All- Ireland medal holders. In 1991 Downey was captain of her native-county once again. The year started badly when Kilkenny's great run of success in the National League came to an abrupt end. Cork defeated 'the Cats' in the final of that competition, denying the county a fifth league title in-a-row. In spite of this defeat Downey's side later qualified for the All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition once again and an intriguing contest took place. Kilkenny won the day by 3‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10. Once again it was Kilkenny's success in getting goals at vital times that gave them a seventh All-Ireland title in-a- row. It was Downey's eleventh All-Ireland medal overall. She lifted the O'Duffy Cup for the third time. The team bounced back in 1993 after a decline, with Downey winning her eighth National League medal. It was 1994, however, before Downey lined out in her next All-Ireland final. Wexford, Kilkenny's nearest neighbours, provided the opposition on that occasion. The game had a familiar ring to it as 'the Cats' were on top for pretty much all of the game. A final score of 2‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì8 gave Downey her twelfth All-Ireland medal on the field of play. On the same day her sister Ann collected her eleventh medal on the field of play. Downey's camogie prowess was subsequently acknowledged when she was named Camogie Player of the Year. In 1995 Downey lined out in her final championship season with Kilkenny. It was a remarkable twenty-five years since she made her debut as a thirteen-year-old. For the final time she lined out to play on All-Ireland final day as Cork provided the opposition. Kilkenny, however, were not the force that they once were. After an exciting game Cork emerged victorious by 4‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì10, thus, denying Downey a thirteenth All-Ireland medal. There was remarkable symmetry associated with the game. Her first All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny defeated by Cork while her final All- Ireland final appearance saw Cork claim the victory once again. Downey retired from inter-county camogie following this defeat. =Provincial= Downey also lined out with Leinster in the Gael Linn sponsored inter-provincial camogie championship. In all she won ten inter-provincial titles with her province. Retirement In retirement Downey's reputation as one of the greatest players of all-time has grown. Her haul of twelve All-Ireland medals is surpassed by only two other all-time greats, √öna O'Connor and Kathleen Mills. In 2004 Downey was named in the left corner-forward position on a special team picked to celebrate the centenary of the Camogie Association of Ireland. Downey boycotted the presentation in protest at the absence of her sister Ann from the team.

As part of that work he accompanied Schatz to Jerusalem. Art career Lilien was one of the two artists to accompany Boris Schatz to what is now Israel in 1906 for the purpose of establishing Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, and taught the school's first class in 1906. Although his stay in the country was short- lived, he left his indelible stamp on the creation of an Eretz Israel style, placing biblical subjects in the Zionist context and oriental settings, conceived in an idealized Western design. In the first two decades of the century, Lilien's work served as a model for the Bezalel group. Lilien is known for his famous photographic portrait of Theodor Herzl. He often used Herzl as a model, considering his features a perfect representation of the \\"New Jew.\\" In 1896, he received an award for photography from the avantgarde magazine Jugend. Lilien illustrated several books. In 1923, an exhibition of his work opened in New York. Lilien's illustrated books include Juda (1900), Biblically-themes poetry by Lilien's Christian friend, B√∂rries Freiherr von M√ºnchhausen, and Lieder des Ghetto (Songs of the Ghetto) (1903), Yiddish poems by Morris Rosenfeld translated into German.

Casey A Wood and F. Marjorie Fyfe, (Stanford University Press, 1961), 495. She was the mistress and later the last wife of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II. The marriage was conducted while she was on her deathbed, therefore it was considered non-canonical.  Family  Possibly born in Agliano in Piedmont, where her ancestors of the Ghibelline Lancia (or Lanza) noble family, so-called since Manfred I (fl. 1160‚Äì1214) had been lancifer pikeman of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, served as margraves. There is no source which definitively states who her parents were, historians have offered three theories that she was a granddaughter of Manfred I Lancia: #as daughter of his daughter (maybe also named Bianca), by a son (name unknown) of Guglielmo di Moncucco and Belda di Agliano. #as daughter of his son Bonifacio di Agliano by an unknown wife. #as daughter of his son Manfred II, possible from a marriage to a lady called Bianca, of the Maletta family. If she was a daughter of Manfred II, she had seven siblings: four brothers (Manfred III, Guglielmo, Galvano and Frederick) and three sisters (Beatrice, Agnes and Isabella).  Relationship with Frederick II  Bianca lived most of her life in Lancia Castle of Brolo, the ancestral residence of her family, the Castello Normanno in Patern√≤ and the castle of Gioia del Colle. She met Frederick II, who was then married to Yolande of Jerusalem, in 1225 at Agliano near Asti. Thenceforth, it is said, the two maintained a romantic relationship. According to some historians, Bianca was the only true love of Frederick's life; others consider this a romantic exaggeration. It was certainly beneficial to the interests of the Lancia family, who were favoured by the Emperor with political posts in Italy (Manfredo III was appointed Imperial Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire's northern Italian territories and Podesta of Alessandria, Milan and Chieri; Galvano became Imperial Vicar of Tuscany, Podesta of Padova, Prince of Salerno, Count of Fondi and Grand Marshal of Sicily; and Frederick was appointed Count of Squillace and Viceroy of Apulia). Nonetheless, the relationship of Bianca and Frederick was the longest to all the affairs of the Emperor. After the death of Isabella of England, Frederick's third wife, in 1241, he endowed Bianca with the castle of Monte Sant'Angelo, located in the cities of Vieste and Siponto. By the terms of the will of William II of Sicily, the castle was the traditional dower of the Sicilian queens consort. Bianca died either in the castle of Patern√≤ or the castle of Gioia del Colle.  Marriage and children  The Chronicle of Salimbene di Adam, and also Matthew of Paris claimed that a \\"confirmatio matrimonii in articulo mortis\\" (\\"marriage ceremony in the moments of death\\") took place between Bianca and Frederick when she was dying. Bianca, apparently, desired the marriage for the salvation of her soul and the safety of their children's future.Matthew of Paris, Mon. Germ. Hist. Scriptores XXVIII pp. 360-361Cronica Fratris Salimbene di Adam, Ordinis Minorem, MGH SS XXXII p. 349 This marriage however was not deemed canonical by the Church, perhaps due to the fact that Frederick and Bianca's children were all born out of wedlock. Frederick and Bianca had three children together: * Constance (1230‚Äì1307), who married the Emperor of Nicea, John Vatatzes, and thereupon her name changed to Anna. * Manfred (1232‚Äì1266), who succeeded his father as ruler of Sicily (initially as regent, before usurping the throne for himself). * Violante (1233‚Äì1264), who married Richard Sanseverino, Count of Caserta.  Death  It is not known exactly when she died. There are several conflicting reports. This date lingers in various reference works but appears based only on the assumption that she died after the birth of her last child, and before the marriage of her husband to his next wife. There are credible reports that she married Frederick while she was on her deathbed, and that her son was 12 at this time. Bianca may have died a short while before the wedding of her daughter to John Vatatzes in 1244.By this time, Frederick II's longtime enemy, the Duke Frederick of Austria became his most important ally, and, to reinforce this new alliance, were make plans to a marriage between the Emperor and the teenager niece of the Duke, Gertrude. She refused the marriage. One source states that she died 20 years after the start of her relationship with Frederick, however the same source states that she died 20 years before events that were occurring in 1256.

The 45-ton sloop was built to allow the trading venture to access smaller inlets the Columbia could not reach. At the end of his second voyage Gray sold the ship to the Spanish Navy. It was renamed Orcacitas (also spelled Orcasitas or Horcasitas) and served the Naval Department of San Blas for some years. Construction The skeleton of the craft was brought with the Columbia when it sailed from Boston in 1790.Scofield, John. Hail, Columbia: Robert Gray, John Kendrick and the Pacific Fur Trade. Oregon Historical Society Press. 1993. p. 241 At Clayoquot Sound the crew of the Columbia built the winter quarters that were named Fort Defiance and also began construction of the Adventure. The keel was laid on October 3, 1791, on Meares Island.Howay, Frederic W. Voyages of the Columbia to the Northwest Coast. Boston: The Massachusetts Historical Society (1941), p. 248 Over the winter the ship slowly began to take shape.Howay, Frederic W., p. 227 Then on February 23, 1792, the ship was launched, but not without first getting stuck halfway down the ramp.Howay, Frederic W., p. 313-314, 276 Thus the first American built vessel on the Pacific was launched.Carey, Charles Henry. History of Oregon. Vol. 1: Pioneer Historical Publishing Co.:Chicago. 1922. p. 139 The first non- indigenous vessel built on the Pacific Northwest coast was the North West America, constructed in 1788 by Chinese labourers employed by British captain John Meares. Spain had been building ships on the Pacific coast of Mexico since the 16th century. First voyage On Monday, April 2, 1792, the Adventure set sail for its maiden voyage.Howay, Frederic W., p. 314 The captain was Robert Haswell, the First Mate of the Columbia.Howay, Frederic W., p. 390 Also assigned to the small ship was Abraham Waters, who became the mate on the Adventure. He had been Fourth Mate on the Columbia. Ten others were assigned, giving the ship a total crew of twelve men. Only a few weeks after departing from the Columbia, the Adventure rendezvoused on April 17 and transferred 500 skins to the larger ship before separating again.Howay, Frederic W., p. 405 After this the 45-ton ship sailed northward. In July they reached as far north as Sitka Sound in Russian-America.Howay, Frederic W., p. 345 After continued trading, including stops in the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Adventure and crew re-joined Gray and the Columbia near Port Montgomery on September 3, 1792.Howay, Frederic W., p. 350-351 Spanish vessel Shortly after his departure as commandant of Nootka Sound, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra met Gray in the Columbia with the Adventure in company. The two captains had previously discussed the idea of selling the Adventure, and agreed to discuss it further at Neah Bay, a Spanish outpost in the process of being abandoned. They sailed in convoy to Neah Bay, arriving on September 26. In addition to the Columbia and Adventure, Neah Bay was occupied by the Spanish vessels Princesa, Activa, under Salvador Fidalgo and Bodega y Quadra, and the American vessel , under former Columbia First Mate Joseph Ingraham.Howay, Frederic W., p. 355 Bodega y Quadra and Gray soon agreed to a sale of the Adventure. The bill of sale, dated September 28, 1792, indicates the price was \\"Fifteen hundred Dollars in kind\\". The phrase \\"in kind\\" meant sea otter pelts. According to Captain Robert Haswell, 75 skins of superior quality were paid by Bodega. John Boit of the Columbia calculated the price as \\"72 prime Sea Otter Skins worth 55 Dollars each in Canton which is to 3960$, which at 50 per Cent advance at home is 7440 Spanish Piasters, which is a good price.\\" Bodega renamed the sloop Orcacitas, one of the names of the Count of Revillagigedo, Viceroy of New Spain. Bodega did not need the vessel himself, but thought it would be useful to the Naval Department of San Blas. Command of the Orcacitas was given to Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro, and it sailed in convoy with Bodega's Activa to Monterey, California. They left Neah Bay on September 29.

Early & private life Katherine Rosaleen Mills was born in 31 South Square, Inchicore, Dublin, on 8 October 1923 to a Dublin mother and a Cork father. When she was just eighteen months old her mother died, leaving her to be raised by her maternal grandmother. From a young age Mills showed a great interest in a wide range of sport. She was educated in the local convent school at Goldenbridge, where she played table tennis and soccer as well as doing gymnastics. However, camogie was her first love. Her father worked in the Inchicore works and therefore Kathleen was able to participate in and avail of the sporting activities in the GSR Athletic Union. Two pence per week were deducted from the worker‚Äôs wages to go towards the financing of the sports activities in the Railway.Buses, Trains and Gaelic Games by John Cassidy (Original Writing, 2009); ; see also references on CIE GAA website and summary of book on Profile, originalwriting.ie; accessed 25 February 2015. In 1947, Mills married George Hill. Playing career Mills made her camogie debut with the Great Southern Railways club in Dublin in 1938 at the age of 14, and was promoted to the senior team for her second match. Three years later in 1941 she made her debut for Dublin while still 16 and played in Dublin's unsuccessful All-Ireland final against Cork, winning her first All- Ireland medal after a replay against Cork a year later. In 1943 the same counties met in the All-Ireland final for the third year in-a-row. Once again Mills ended up claiming an All-Ireland medal, her goal from fifty yards range being described as the highlight of the match. The following year, 1944, brought a third All-Ireland medal. In 1945 and 1946 a dispute in the camogie association kept Dublin out of the All-Ireland championship in spite of being Leinster champions in both years. In 1948 Dublin were back on form and Mills captured a fourth All-Ireland medal. She took no part in the 1949 championship, however, the 1950s would bring much success to Mills. Between 1950 and 1955 (inclusive), Mills captured six All-Ireland titles in-a-row. In 1956 ‚Äúthe Dubs‚Äù surrendered their crown to Anrtim but it was soon reclaimed in 1957. In 1958 Mills was appointed captain of the Dublin camogie team. Led by her, Dublin defeated Tipperary to capture yet another All-Ireland title. She captured three more All-Ireland medals in 1959, 1960 and 1961. The occasion of the 1961 final was special as it was Mills' 38th birthday and her last outing in a Dublin jersey.

It is also the first inverted roller coaster in Texas.  Characteristics  Despite its shortened track length, The Great White follows an identical ride layout as the Batman the Ride coasters at numerous Six Flags parks. At 2,562 feet (about 150 shorter than Batman's 2,693 foot layout), the coaster doesn't allow riders as much time to \\"recuperate\\" between inversions, consequently offering an extreme, forceful ride experience. Furthermore, The Great White sits lower to the ground, often deceiving its riders with elements such as \\"foot-choppers\\" as there are many trees and shrubs surrounding the coaster's track. The Great White is sometimes considered to be more intense than its Six Flags' cousin because of its added 8th row (Goliath has only seven rows per train) and shorter track length (2,562 feet, compared to Goliath's 2,700 feet. Its layout consists of the following inversions: *a Vertical Loop *a Zero-G Roll *a second Vertical Loop *a Wingover *a second Wingover When The Great White opened, its queue line wrapped around a large-scale shark aquarium, similar to the manta aquariums found in the newly constructed Manta at SeaWorld Orlando.

Founded in 1975 by James R. Millman, a 25-year-old event marketing executive with Philip Morris, Inc., Millsport gained notoriety and national prominence with its involvement in Olympic and NFL sponsorship in the 1990s by Visa, GTE, Pepsi, Frito-Lay and others. History Millman, an Ohio University grad who began his career in 1968 as a production assistant with ABC Sports, served as the agency‚Äôs chairman and CEO until 2004. In 1981, Millsport joined advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (now DDB), one of the largest ad agencies in the U.S. Six years later, Millsport left Doyle Dane Bernbach to once again become an independent agency. In 1996, Millsport and Omnicom's Diversified Agency Services division formed a new sports marketing partnership. It marked Omnicom's first venture into sports marketing, and, under Millman's leadership, the firm achieved the strongest record of long- term client retention in the sports industry, with +20 year service relationships with the agency's three largest accounts. In 2002, Millsport VP Mike Bartelli opened an office in Charlotte, N.C., dedicated to its Motorsports practice. The following year, Bob Basche, a managing partner in the business, was promoted to CEO, replacing Millman, who remained as chairman. Millsport became the sports sponsorship and motorsports consulting and activation division of fellow Omnicom agency The Marketing Arm in 2004, a move that triggered several personnel moves within the agency. Howard Jacobs was promoted from senior VP/marketing and business development to president of Millsport. Basche moved to chairman of Millsport and chief relationship officer for The Marketing Arm, while Millsport founder James Millman ended his association with the company to launch a new agency in partnership with Omnicom, called Partnership Marketing Connection (PMC). In 2006, Dan Belmont joined Millsport as president, replacing Howard Jacobs, who left to join Millsport client XM Satellite Radio as SVP of strategic partnership marketing. In 2008, Bartelli was named President, Motorsports. He left later that same year, joining Petty Holdings as CMO.

They also gave their name to the Pays de Caux, attested as Pago Calcis in 843 (Kaleto in 1206).  Geography  The territory of the Calates closely corresponded to the Pays de Caux. They dwelled north of the neighbouring Veliocasses, and were separated from the Ambiani in the northeast by a minor tribe, the Catoslugi. They occupied a section of the coast, between the Sequana and the Phrudis rivers. Harfleur (Caracotinum) was their principal port.  Culture  Whether the Catales should be regarded as Gallic or Belgic is debatable. Caesar appears to attribute them to Belgica, their coins were of Belgic type, and they joined the Belgic opposition to Rome 57 BC. But, elsewhere, Caesar lists them along Armorican peoples, and they were not, unless briefly, part of the province of Gallia Belgica under the Roman Empire.

The Court considered the nature of a handicap in law and found that a handicap is not merely a biomedical condition but rather can exist as a perceived limitation or social construct. The decision arises from two separate claims by individuals for discrimination under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. R√©jeanne Mercier was refused employment with the city of Montreal as a Gardener- horticulturalist on the grounds that her medical condition involving chronic back pains would be too costly and would interfere with her long-term employment. Palmerino Troilo was a police officer for the city of Boisbriand. He was dismissed after missing work due to having Crohn's disease. Judgment of the Court Justice L'Heureux-Dube wrote the reasons for a unanimous Court and dismissed the appeal. The issue focused on the interpretation of the word \\"handicap\\" in the Quebec Charter. She stated that given the Charter's quasi- constitutional status it must be given a liberal and purposive interpretation. A handicap can exist outside of functional limitations. There is also a subjective component on which there can be discrimination.

It was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal. It was filmed in 1972 as The Amazing Mr BlundenIMDB listing for The Amazing Mr. Blunden with Laurence Naismith as Mr. Blunden and Diana Dors as Mrs Wickens. Plot summary Mr. Blunden, an elderly solicitor, visits Mrs. Allen, a widow who lives with her three children Jamie, Lucy and the baby, in Camden Town, London, England. He tells her that his firm are looking for a suitable person to act as a caretaker to an old, abandoned house in the country until such time as the descendants of the original owners can be traced. When Mrs. Allen leaves the room to tend to her baby, Mr. Blunden mentions to Jamie and Lucy that there are rumours that the old house is haunted but that ghosts can often appear as ordinary people, perhaps children like themselves, and that ghosts are often people in need of help... Jamie and Lucy confirm that they wouldn't be scared of ghosts that appeared in that form and would help, if they could. Before Mrs. Allen returns, Mr. Blunden leaves, giving Jamie an old, faded card for the firm Blunden, Blunden and Claverton, where Mrs. Allen should call the next day to inquire about the post. The Allens visit the firm, which, surprisingly, is called Blunden, Claverton and Smith. The solicitors are puzzled at Mrs Allen's visit, since the job has not been advertised but are nonetheless delighted to have found someone to take the job, in spite of the rumours of ghosts and soon the family find themselves living in the caretaker's cottage at Langley Park. Lucy explores the house alone. In the attic she thinks she hears voices in the distance ‚Äì but can't understand what they're saying. The woman who comes in from the village to clean confirms that they're the ghostly voices of children, just children and nothing to worry about. One morning soon after, Lucy is walking in the garden, gathering flowers. She suddenly becomes aware of a heavy, oppressive feeling and the warning song of a blackbird. Her eyes can't seem to focus but she thinks she sees two transparent figures walking towards her through the mist that hovers over the lawn. She panics, screams and runs to Jamie who returns with her to investigate. Everything appears normal until, suddenly, they both become aware of the oppressive feeling and the repeating, hypnotic blackbird song. The two figures are walking towards them through the mist and as they draw near, the figures solidify into a young girl, about their age and a younger boy. Jamie and Lucy are relieved to meet what appear to be two ordinary children, albeit that their clothes seem a little old-fashioned. Only after talking for some minutes, do they notice that the newcomers cast no shadows on the sunny path.... The new arrivals ‚Äì Sara and Georgie Latimer ‚Äì explain that they are not ghosts in the ordinary sense. They have come from a hundred years in the past when they lived at Langley Park. Their guardian, uncle Bertie (a sensual, dissolute and penniless man), has fallen in love with a music-hall performer, Bella Wickens and moved her mother and father in as housekeeper and caretaker to the house. However, the mother ‚Äì Mrs. Wickens ‚Äì has determined to murder Sara and Georgie, so that Bertie will inherit the family wealth ‚Äì currently held in trust until Georgie comes of age. The children learn of Mrs. Wickens' scheme and attempt to convince the family solicitor ‚Äì a certain Mr. Blunden ‚Äì of the danger. Blunden reacts violently and negatively to the news and the children are locked up, out of sight and out of mind. One night, by the intervention of some supernatural agency that the children do not understand, they are led to the library of the house. There they find a book containing the recipe for a charm ‚Äì 'A Charm To Move The Wheel of Time'. By brewing the infusion and drinking it, the children will be able to move through time to find the help they need. Sara and Georgie ask Jamie and Lucy to come back to their time and help them escape the fate that awaits them. Jamie and Lucy agree ‚Äì although Lucy is less sure than Jamie. Sara gives them the recipe for the charm and arranges to meet them the next day. She and Georgie disappear back to the past.... The next day, in the local cemetery, Lucy and Jamie find the grave of Sara and Georgie and are disheartened. The sexton tells them that the children died in the fire that razed the house to the ground. They brew the potion and go to meet Sara and Georgie as arranged. Only Sara is waiting for them. Georgie has upset Mrs. Wickens and been locked in the cellar. Sara is keen to get back to him. At that moment, Mr. Blunden arrives. This is the spirit of the Mr. Blunden who ignored the pleas of Sara and Georgie and who is suffering now, because of their deaths all those years ago. He has the opportunity to put things right and he promises Jamie and Lucy that he will keep them safe in the past; that any pain that must be suffered will be suffered by him. Sara confirms that she has forgiven Blunden. She is also aware of the grave in the churchyard. Jamie and Lucy drink the potion. The world around them swirls and goes black... ...and they find themselves back in Sara and Georgie's time ‚Äì a hundred years before. Mr. Blunden tells them that, for a while, things must go on as they did before but that when the time was right he will appear and help Jamie and Lucy save Sara and Georgie. Indeed, for a while, things do progress as they did but eventually Mrs. Wickens drugs the children and they sleep, as Mr. Wickens starts a fire in the library beneath the nursery. Tom, the gardener's boy, attempts to rescue them and manages to climb up the outside of the house to the nursery window. By now the fire has taken a firm hold and Jamie cannot get into the house, to effect a rescue from below. Just as he's losing heart, Mr. Blunden appears, takes him by the hand and leads him through the flames. Jamie feels nothing, while Blunden is clearly suffering both his pain and Jamie's and the guilt of a hundred years. Tom, Sara and Georgie escape the house but as Jamie attempts to leave he becomes trapped. As Lucy stands outside crying for Mr. Blunden to help him, the world around her swirls and blackens ‚Äì and she finds herself back in her own time. Searching the ruins of the house she finds Jamie, unconscious. Some time later, with Jamie still ill, Lucy attends church and wanders through the cemetery afterwards. There, instead of the small stone marking Sara and Georgie's grave, she finds a tall granite memorial to Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden, who died to save the children in his care ‚Äì a hundred years ago. They did it! They saved Sara and Georgie! She returns home. Her mother tells her that Jamie is awake. She runs to his room and the two talk about their journey to the past. When Jamie is well, the family receive a visit from one of the Solicitors at Blunden, Claverton and Smith. It seems they have traced the true owners of the house. Jamie and Lucy are sad, knowing this means they will have to leave, until the Solicitor explains that Sara Latimer married Tom the gardener's boy, emigrating to America, whilst Georgie inherited the house. It seems that Sara's daughter married a man named Allen and that ‚Äì in fact ‚Äì the true owner of the house is Jamie. Sara was their great-great grandmother. Jamie runs off to explore the grounds anew, now as their owner. Lucy goes upstairs to the attic where she hopes, now she belongs to the house, that she will understand what the voices of the ghosts are saying....

Baseball America named him as the Mets Number One Prospect for 2007 and 2008. Martinez then saw his status as a blue chip prospect decline over the next few years, due in large part to his frequent stints on the disabled list.

Henry has been walking along the strand close to where he has lived his whole life, at one time or other on either side of \\"a bay or estuary\\".Lyons, C. R., Samuel Beckett, MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 114 Henry starts to talk, a single word, \\"on,\\" followed by the sea again, followed by the voice ‚Äì louder and more insistent this time, repeating the same word, as it will say, then repeat as a command, the words \\"stop\\" and \\"down.\\" Each time, Henry obediently yet reluctantly does what his voice first says, then tells him to do, he stops and sits down on the shingle. Throughout the play the sea acts like a character in its own right (much as the light in Play does). =The first monologue= The sea, it has always been assumed, was the cause of his father's death: \\"the evening bathe you took once too often\\",Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 93 however the next sentence tells us: \\"We never found your body, you know, that held up probate an unconscionable time\\".Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 93,94 Nothing in the text explicitly says that Henry's father was suicidal ‚Äì though this has been inferred from the story of Bolton and Holloway discussed later. He imagines his father, whom he describes as ‚Äúold ‚Ä¶ blind and foolish‚Äù,Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 94 sitting beside him on the beach and addresses the whole opening monologue to him, apart from a single aside to the audience, but the father never once responds. His father could never stay away from the sea and it seems neither can his son. \\"The sea presents an antithetical image to Henry. He must stay near it, and yet he attempts to distance himself from its sound.\\"Lyons, C. R., Samuel Beckett, MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 113 Even when he finally received his inheritance he only relocated to the other side of the bay; it has been a great many years since he actually swam in it. He tried once going to landlocked Switzerland but still couldn‚Äôt get the sound of the sea out of his head. To drown out the sound, rather than seek out company, he began making up stories but could never finish any of them. He remembers \\" a great one\\" and starts to tell it: : He describes a scene before a fire that is about to go out. A man, Bolton, is standing there in his dressing gown awaiting the arrival of his doctor, Holloway, who we learn later may be the name of Henry‚Äôs own doctor. It is late, past midnight. He hears the doorbell and goes to the window to check; it is winter and the ground is covered with snow. The doctor has arrived, a \\"fine old chap, six foot, burly\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 95 standing there in his macfarlane, a heavy caped overcoat. : Bolton lets him in. Holloway wants to know why he was called for but he is cut short. Bolton pleads with him, \\"Please! PLEASE!\\" and then they stand there in silence, the doctor trying to warm himself by the fire, what is left of it, and his patient staring out the window. Only all is not silent, not entirely, there is the sound of a drip (evocative of the remark Hamm makes in Endgame: \\"There is something dripping in my head\\");Beckett, S., Endgame: A Play in One Act (New York: Grove, 1958), pp 13,50 this agitates Henry greatly, and he breaks off his story there for a second. Henry tells his father that, after a time, his stories were not company enough and he began feeling the need for someone from his past to be with him. He then continues: : Holloway is annoyed. Presumably he understands what he‚Äôs being asked for but avoids showing that he does. Instead he complains about the fact that, despite his being dragged out on a night like this, his old friend has not had the common decency to heat and light the room suitably let alone provide a proper welcome and some kind of refreshment. He says he is going to leave, regretting having come in the first place, but doesn‚Äôt make any move to go. Henry suddenly stops his story and jumps to the last time he saw his father alive. His father's eventual disappearance followed an angry interchange between the two of them. He wanted Henry to go swimming with him but Henry refuses and so the last words his father ends up saying to him are: \\"A washout,James Knowlson, in Damned to Fame (pp 142, 730 n 104) conjectures that Beckett's decision to abandon his teaching post at Trinity College, which, at the time, his father would have viewed as \\"running away from his responsibilities and giving up a worthwhile career for nothing\\", finds expression in Embers. that‚Äôs what you are, a washout!\\" Whether his father was accidentally washed out to sea and drowned or deliberately killed himself is something no one knows for sure. Understandably Henry has punished himself for years over his decision not to go with him. His relationship with his daughter had not been good either, a clingy child and, as we discover later, not particularly proficient or interested in anything she was required to do; Henry blames the \\"horrid little creature\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 96 for the break-up of his marriage. He re-enacts going for a walk with her and how he ended up reducing the girl to tears when she refuses to let go of his hand. Henry treats his Addie in much the same way his father appears to have treated him. He remembers: \\"That was always the way, walk all over the mountains with you talking and talking and then suddenly mum and home in misery and not a word to a soul for a week.\\" \\"The consequent judgement that Henry was a ‚Äòsulky little bastard, better off dead‚Äô is consistent with his father's final verdict of his son as a ‚Äòwashout‚Äô.\\"Brown, V., Yesterday‚Äôs Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett , (doctoral thesis) Out of the blue Henry calls out to his estranged, possibly ex, probably dead wife, Ada. =The dialogue= The central sequence involves a dialogue between Henry and Ada, which provokes three specific memories presented in the form of short \\"evocation[s]\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 100 involving other characters (each lasts only a few seconds). Each occasion ends in a character crying or crying out and is artificially cut short at that instant. Before this the two engage in quasi-domestic small talk. Ada wants to know where their daughter, Addie, is. Henry says she is with her music master. She chides him for sitting on the cold stones and offers to put her shawl under him, which he allows. She asks if he‚Äôs wearing his long johns but Henry is difficult about answering her. The sound of hooves distracts him. Ada makes a joke about horses and tries to get him to laugh. He then returns to his old preoccupation, the sound of the sea. He wants to go but Ada says they can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre waiting on Addie. This triggers the first evocation. : In his first flashback Henry imagines the couple's daughter, with her overbearing music master.James Knowlson, in Damned to Fame (p715 n 37) suggests that this character was based on ‚ÄòCommendatore‚Äô Michele Esposito in Ranelagh, a Dublin- based Italian music teacher whose teaching methods were notorious in the city‚Äôs music circles. Addie first plays some scales and then begins a Chopin waltz, number 5 in A-flat major. \\"In the first chord of bass, bar 5, she plays E instead of F.\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 98 The teacher strikes the piano with his cylindrical ruler\\"Samuel Beckett's father was a quantity surveyor, and such a ruler, 'a solid ebony cylindrical rod', Phil Baker discovered, was kept in the offices of Beckett & Medcalf ‚Äì Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 116 and Addie stops playing. ‚ÄúEff!It has been suggested that this may be Beckett alluding to ‚Äòfuck‚Äô bearing in mind that, on its initial transmission even the word ‚Äòarse‚Äô was excised, but there is no clear evidence to support this other than the fact that a favourite joke expression of Beckett‚Äôs was ‚Äòeff the ineffable‚Äô (Quoted in Lawley, P., Embers: An Interpretation ). (See Fuck) Eff!‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 99 he insists and eventually has to show her the note. She starts again, makes the same mistake and has to endure his ranting again only this time he reduces his pupil to tears. :The second involves Addie again, this time with her riding instructor: \\"Now Miss! Elbows in Miss! Hands down Miss! (Hooves trotting.) Now Miss! Back straight Miss! Knees in Miss! (Hooves cantering.) Now Miss! Tummy in Miss! Chin up Miss! (Hooves galloping.) Now Miss! Eyes front Miss! (ADDIE begins to wail.) Now Miss! Now Miss!\\" : The third scene briefly recalls Henry forcing his attentions on Ada, some twenty years earlier. It ends with Ada crying out, the cry merging with the sound of the sea, louder now. As before the scene is unceremoniously truncated. Ada suggests that he consult Holloway about his talking. This was a source of some embarrassment to her when they were together. She cites an instance where she has to explain to their daughter why her father was talking to himself in the lavatory.Mouth in Not I also likens her logorrhoea to using a lavatory and the only appointment Henry finds he has up and coming at the end of the play is to get a waste pipe attended to. Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 222,104 She can‚Äôt understand why such \\"a lovely peaceful gentle soothing sound\\" should upset him so and refuses to believe that his talking helps drown it out. He tells he that he's even taken to \\"walk[ing] about with [a] gramophone\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 101 but forget it this day. He reminds Ada that it was on this very beach they had sex for the first time. She‚Äôd shown great reluctance and they had to wait a long time before the coast was clear. She did not get pregnant right away however and it was years before they had Addie. He wonders what age the girl is now but ‚Äì unexpectedly for a mother ‚Äì Ada says she doesn‚Äôt know. He proposes going for a row, \\"to be with my father\\",Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 102 he tells her but, again, she reminds him that their daughter will be coming soon and would be upset to find him gone. Henry explains to Ada that his father doesn‚Äôt talk with him like she does. She is not surprised and predicts that a day will come when there will be no one left and he will be alone with only his own voice for company. She remembers meeting his family in the midst of having a row, his father, mother and a sister threatening to kill herself. The father storms out slamming the door, as he did the day he disappeared for good (if this is in fact not the same day), but she passes him later sitting staring out to sea (bear in mind Henry said his father was blind) in a posture that reminded her of Henry himself. \\"Is this rubbish a help to you, Henry? [she wonders out loud.] \\"I can try and go on a little if you wish.\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 103 He fails to answer though and so she slips out of his consciousness. =The second monologue= He says he's not ready and begs her to stay even if she won‚Äôt speak and \\"Henry improvises upon her story, attempting to build it into a more complex and extended narrative but he fails\\".Lyons, C. R., Samuel Beckett, MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 112 What is interesting here is that Henry imagines that Ada, after witnessing his father sitting on the rock, gets on the tram (possibly horse-driven)The last horse- driven trams in Ireland were in 1957 (See Irish horse trams) to go home, then alights and returns to check on him only to find the beach empty. Was she the last person to see him alive? Resigning himself to being alone Henry picks up the Bolton story from where he left off: : The doctor says if Bolton wants an injection ‚Äì \\"meaning an anaesthetic\\" ‚Äì just to let down his trousers and he‚Äôll give him one but Bolton doesn‚Äôt reply. Instead he starts playing with the blind, drawing it up and then letting it fall, like an eye blinking. This infuriates Holloway and he insists Bolton stop which he does. Instead he lights a candle and, holding it \\"above his head, walks over and looks Holloway full in the eye\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 104 but still says nothing. This obviously makes the doctor uncomfortable. He again offers to give him an injection but Bolton wants something else, something he has obviously asked for before and the doctor has refused to go through with, possibly to administer a lethal injection rather than merely a jab to dull the pain. \\"Please, Holloway!\\" he pleads one final time. There the story peters out with the two men standing eye to eye in silence. Henry is like the \\"writer-protagonists of the novels, using their speech/writing to fill the moments until death.\\"Lyons, C. R., Samuel Beckett, MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 115 But he finds he can‚Äôt go on. He curses, gets to his feet, walks over to the water's edge where he takes out and consults a pocket diary. With the exception of an appointment with the \\"plumber at nine [to attend to] the waste\\" pipe his future is empty. The play ends with no resolution other than the certainty that the next day and the next day will be the same as the previous ones. Interpretation Since Embers can be interpreted in a variety of ways it is perhaps worthwhile considering what Beckett said to Jack MacGowran, not specifically about this play, but about all his writing: : \\"Beckett told me that when I came to a passage with several meanings, the obvious one is the right one. He told me he did not create symbols where they did not exist, only where they are apparent. He kept repeating that line from Watt ‚Äì ‚Äòno symbols where none intended‚Äô.Beckett, S., Watt (London: John Calder [1953] 1998), p 255 At the time he was very annoyed with the symbol-hunting scholars who seemed to be breathing down his neck all the time.\\"Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), pp 589,590 Henry, the central character in this play, cannot find the words to articulate his situation and fills in the blanks with what he can in an effort to make sense of things. In this context, the play is its own metaphor. Words have become redundant, but they are all Henry has to explain the unexplainable. If critics get frustrated because there are no answers then they‚Äôve got the point. =Sound Effects= \\"Beckett‚Äôs paradoxical endeavour to question sound in this radio play is [partly] achieved through the use of grossly made sound effects (coconut-like sound of hooves, exaggerated amplifications of Addie‚Äôs cries, etc.).\\"Ravez, S., Notes from the London Beckett Seminar, 26 January 2000, Embers, first session The sound of the sea dominates the play but it is not an accurate representation and deliberately so. Henry warns us that the sea sound effects are not perfect and this casts doubt as to whether he is even on the beach at all; perhaps everything in the play is taking place within his head. The pioneering sound engineer Desmond Briscoe was responsible for the sound of the sea in the original BBC production. This was his second collaboration with Beckett (he also worked on All That Fall) only this time he \\"utilized a more traditionally ‚Äòmusical‚Äô approach, moulding the abstract sound of the sea using distinct pitches.\\"Louis Niebur, Desmond Briscoe‚Äôs Obituary, The Guardian, Tuesday 19 December 2006 \\"Henry also demands certain sound effects to provide a contrast to the monotony of the sea. He twice asks for the sound of hooves, hoping that the 'ten-ton mammoth' can be trained to mark time; have it 'stamp all day' and 'tramp the world down'. He similarly asks for a drip, as if the sea could be drained by the sound effect.\\"Grant, S., Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Radio Plays: Music of the Absurd, (doctoral thesis) =Henry= Beckett himself, Zilliacus believes, has made the most important point about Embers: \\"‚ÄòCendres,‚Äô he remarked in an interview with P.L. Mignon, ‚Äòrepose sur une ambiguit√©: le personage a-t-il une hallucination ou est-il en pr√©sence de la r√©alit√©?‚Äô\\"Zilliacus, C., Beckett and Broadcasting: a study of the works of Samuel Beckett for and in radio and television (√Öbo, √Öbo Akademi, 1976), p 83 (Embers rests on an ambiguity: is the person having an hallucination or is this really happening?) Paul Lawley feels the need to qualify this statement however: \\"The most important point [perhaps], but one to start from rather than conclude with.\\"Lawley, P., ‚ÄòEmbers: An Interpretation‚Äô in Gontarski, S. E., (Ed.) The Beckett Studies Reader (University Press of Florida, 1993) Like many of Beckett's characters (e.g. Molloy, May in Footfalls), Henry is a writer or at the very least a storyteller, albeit by his own admission, a poor one never actually finishing anything he starts. Fortunately he doesn‚Äôt need to depend on his writing for a living. He may or may not commit what he has written to paper but he performs the core function of a writer, the creation of stories. And as a writer he also needs readers or listeners to hear what he has to say. Like the old woman in Rockaby he only has himself and the voices in his head left to acknowledge his existence however pathetic that existence has become. Henry is undoubtedly a tormented soul. He interrogates the past rigorously but never gets round to actually verbalising what is really on his mind: How did his father die? Was he, in any way, responsible for that death? Is vital information missing or has he repressed it? Is this why he can never complete any of his stories because they are all really the same story and are all missing that something? His life is like a sentence (pun intended) ‚Äì it reached a comma with his father's death and he has been unable to satisfactorily finish it. He has no \\"professional obligations\\", no familial ties and now not even a woman to justify his hanging around this place like, as he puts it, an \\"old grave I cannot tear myself away from\\". =The Sea= Henry's initial monologue focuses on his fixation with the sound of the sea. Right at the start he even says, \\"That sound you hear is the sea ‚Ä¶ I mention it because the sound is so strange, so unlike the sound of the sea, that if you didn't see what it was you wouldn't know what it was.\\" \\"The ‚Äòyou‚Äô here can be taken to be the dead father, with whom Henry is sitting on the strand. But if so, it makes little sense since, as we soon learn, the father lived at the sea's edge all his life and presumably would know how the sea sounds. Henry's information thus functions ironically, or even metalinguistically: on the one hand, it shows the narrator having a brief moment of power over the father whose death haunts him; on the other, we can read the speech as an aside to the audience,\\"Lawley, P., Embers: An Interpretation emphasising that everything they are experiencing is a part of a fiction, even the sea. Jonathan Kalb has even suggested that everything including the sea and the beach are all merely figments of Henry‚Äôs imagination.Kalb, J., ‚ÄòThe mediated Quixote: the radio and television plays, and Film‚Äô in Pilling, J., (Ed.) Cambridge Companion to Beckett (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), p 129 The images (symbols and metaphors) that spring to mind when people see the sea (another pun Beckett cannot have failed to notice) have become somewhat clich√©d over the years and Beckett takes full advantage of this fact; literature (not forgetting the visual arts) has done much of his groundwork for him. The sound of the sea continues throughout the play always \\"moving according to the temporal laws of the tide\\"Lyons, C. R., Samuel Beckett, MacMillan Modern Dramatists (London: MacMillan Education, 1983), p 111 suggesting a linearality to the time line but the action is grouped by association rather than presented in a chronological order. The omnipresent sea is less of a natural phenomenon than another mental ghost haunting him no matter where he goes, even reacting to events (e.g. during the sex scene) by getting louder; it clearly has its own voice or perhaps it is all that remains of his father's voice since it represents his grave. Either way the sea is a constant reminder of death and Henry's attempts to drown out its sound \\"seem to manifest the typical Beckett antithesis: the desire for death and the desire to keep it at bay by continued speech\\". Beckett's own father (actually a superb swimmer) died at home, of a heart attack it has to be said, on 26 June 1933. In October his mother rented \\"a little house by the sea just beyond Dalkey Harbour. Beckett accompanied her, laden with his books, manuscripts and typewriter. But he never settled down there and questioned ‚Äòhow people have the nerve to live so near, on the sea. It moans in one‚Äôs dreams at night.‚Äô\\"Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 173 The beach there ‚Äì \\"by contract with most Irish beaches ‚Äì is notoriously composed of shingle and pebble\\".Cronin, A., Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p 489 In May 1954 he received a phone call from his sister-in-law to let him know that his brother, Frank, had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Beckett spent several months there up until his brother's eventual death in September. \\"Most evenings he walked alone after dinner along the seashore below the house\\"Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 401 =Henry‚Äôs Father= \\"‚ÄòTo \\"act\\" it is to kill it‚Äô:Samuel Beckett to Barney Rosset, 27 August 1957, referring to his insistence that All that Fall remain a radio play. Quoted in Oppenheim, L., (Ed.) Directing Beckett (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1994), p 191 ‚Äòradio text,‚Äô Beckett here reminds us, is par excellence an art that depends on sound alone and hence cannot be converted to the stage. Furthermore, the sound in question is not just that of the human voice but includes a complex network of nonverbal elements, musical or otherwise. It makes little sense, then, to complain, as does John Pilling, that Beckett should have included the voice of Henry's father, along with Ada's and Addie's voices, in the play: : ‚ÄòThe puzzling thing is that Henry's control over voices does not extend to the most crucial figure of all, his father ‚Ä¶ The failure to incorporate into the physical existence of the play its most important figure is not so much a failure of conception ‚Äì though it might have served to link Henry's life to his story of Bolton ‚Äì as of tact. There seems to be no good reason for the omission.‚Äô \\"But there is a very good reason for the omission, which is that, unlike the theatre, radio makes it possible to represent characters by means of metonymic sound images: The ghost of Henry's father is indeed \\"heard\\" throughout the play: not only when his son acts the role of medium, imitating such parental exhortations as \\"Are you coming for a dip?\\", but also in the recurrent \\"Please! PLEASE!\\" that Bolton addresses to Holloway, and, most important, in the voice of the sea itself.\\"Perloff, M., ‚ÄòThe Silence that is not Silence: Acoustic Art in Beckett‚Äôs Embers‚Äô in Oppenheim, L., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett and the Arts: Music, Visual Arts, and Non-Print Media (New York and London: Garland, 1999) Henry tells us at the very start of the play that his father is blind and yet when Ada passes him she makes mention that he did not see her. As Henry is not only talking to his father at the start it is also true that he is talking to a \\"blind\\" audience too. Is the man actually blind or even figuratively blind? Perhaps Ada was unaware that he was blind though think seems unlikely. \\"As their names suggest, Ada and Addie may not be wife and daughter at all, not even imagined wife and daughter, only father- surrogates: Ada is a near anagram of Dad and Addie a rhyme for Daddie. And Henry himself? Is he perhaps just another of the fictional characters? Ruby Cohn notes that ‚ÄòHenry is a name derived from German Heimrih, meaning head of the family‚ÄôCohn, R., Samuel Beckett: The Comic Gamut (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1962), p 250 he too is a father or father or father- surrogate ‚Äì his own. Why should the figure of the father loom so large in every element of the play? Because the father, the head of the family, is its creator, and it is creation which is Henry's obligation.\\" =Bolton and Holloway= Although the scene where the action takes places is ostensibly a beach, the real action all takes place inside Henry‚Äôs head, which is why Beckett commentators generally speak of this kind of Beckettian dramatic setting as a \\"skullscape\\" or \\"soulscape.\\"The designation \\"skullscape\\" is Linda Ben Zvi's, \\"soulscape\\" is Ruby Cohn's, both in the recorded discussion that follows the production of Embers for the Beckett Festival of Radio Plays, recorded at the BBC Studios, London in January 1988. Paul \\"Lawley has suggested that the enigmatic scene with Bolton‚Äôs opening and shutting the heavy drapes enacts the blinking of an eye, the room thus becoming a skull,\\"Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 170 a skull-within-a-skull in fact. A fuller appreciation of the story of Bolton and Holloway helps with an overall understanding of the rest of the play. Needless to say opinions differ. It is reminiscent of the story May tells in Footfalls where aspects of her and her mother are recast as ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù and ‚ÄúMrs Winter‚Äù. Bolton = Henry Hersh Zeifman, for whom Embers \\"dramatizes a quest for salvation, a quest which, as always, ultimately proves fruitless,\\"Zilliacus, C., Beckett and Broadcasting: a study of the works of Samuel Beckett for and in radio and television (√Öbo, √Öbo Akademi, 1976), p 96 sees this scene as \\"a paradigm of human suffering and divine rejection\\": : Bolton‚Äôs desperate plea to Holloway for help mirrors the confrontation between Henry and his father. Bolton is thus a surrogate for Henry‚Äîimplicitly identified with Christ as sufferer. Both his name (Bolton) and the fact that he wears a red dressing gown (the colour is repeated three times in the text) link him with the Crucifixion (before Christ was nailed to the cross, he was dressed in a scarlet robe). And Holloway, the recipient of Bolton‚Äôs supplication, is a surrogate for Henry‚Äôs father‚Äîimplicitly identified with Christ as saviour. Like Christ, Holloway is a physician, a potential healer of men‚Äôs souls. But the identification is an ironic one. The Physician of the Gospels exclaimed, ‚ÄòI am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me‚Äô (John 14:6); the physician of Embers is a hollow-way, a way leading nowhere. And whereas Christ‚Äôs death on the cross at \`the ninth hour‚Äô represents birth into a new life and a promise of salvation, Holloway‚Äôs actions, likewise at the ninth hour, result in the death of new life, a universal denial of salvation: \`If it‚Äôs an injection you want, Bolton, let down your trousers and I‚Äôll give you one, I have a panhysterectomy at nine‚Äô (italics added [by Zeifman]).Zilliacus, C., Beckett and Broadcasting: a study of the works of Samuel Beckett for and in radio and television (√Öbo, √Öbo Akademi, 1976), p 92Ruby Cohn follows Hersh Zeifman's lead in taking the characters to be \\"embers of the Christian faith, with an implied equation between Henry-Bolton-victim Christ and father- Holloway-savior Christ\\"; see Just Play: Beckett's Theater p 85 and cf. Hersh Zeifman, ‚ÄòReligious Imagery in the Plays of Samuel Beckett‚Äô in Cohn, R., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett (New York: McGraw Hill, 1975), p 90 Lawley's contention could equally be valid in that \\"Henry is losing his creative impersonality and is consequently moving inexorably into identity with his fictional creation, Bolton.\\"Gontarski, S. E., (Ed.) The Beckett Studies Reader (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1993), p 107 Whereas most scholars take Bolton's begging to suggest he wants to die, Michael Robinson, in The Long Sonata of the Dead, puts forward a simpler interpretation: : \\"Into this tale in which Bolton ‚Ä¶ calls out his friend and doctor, Holloway, in the middle of an icy winter night, not because he is ill but because he is alone, Henry puts all his own isolation and desire for companionship. He does this with great imaginative sympathy and the ending, where Bolton does not receive the recognition he has longed for throughout the night, is the more painful because it is clearly Henry‚Äôs loneliness.\\"Robinson, M., The Long Sonata of the Dead: A Study of Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1969), p 288 The sad fact is that company is not the real answer. It is still only an anaesthetic, numbing the pain. In the Beckettian universal construct sadly death rarely brings any relief either. Whether Holloway is a real person or the character in the story even based on a real person is unclear. Bolton = Henry‚Äôs father An alternative stance is taken by Vivian Mercier who \\"suggests that Bolton is in fact Henry‚Äôs father\\"Mercier, V., Beckett/Beckett (London: Souvenir Press, 1990), p 149 because of the use of \\"your\\" rather than \\"his\\" in the expression, \\"and the glim shaking in your old fist\\" assuming of course that Henry has returned to telling his tale to his dead father which seems most likely. Marjorie Perloff concurs with this reading.Perloff, M., ‚ÄòThe Silence that is not Silence: Acoustic Art in Beckett‚Äôs Embers‚Äô in Oppenheim, L., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett and the Arts: Music, Visual Arts, and Non-Print Media, (New York and London: Garland, 1999) This option offers a simpler explanation of the story. If it is based on his father's seeking some kind of escape from a life that has become unendurable, with a worthless son, a suicidal daughter and possibly an argumentative wife all symptoms of it, then Holloway could simply be a personification of any means of release. That the story is missing key elements is due to the fact that Henry himself doesn‚Äôt have these pieces. As his life has dragged on in its own version of unendurability it is only obvious that he will start to relate more and more to the figure of Bolton. If, at this point, Henry were able to end his story, he would be \\"going beyond the confines of his own condition, of which his story is, in all essential aspects, a duplicate. The moment the story can be finished, there will be no one there to finish it'\\".Zilliacus, C., Beckett and Broadcasting: A Study of the Works of Samuel Beckett for Television and Radio (√Öbo, √Öbo Akademi, 1976), p 86 =Ada= Henry's conversation with his wife at first \\"appears to take place in the present, but Ada does not really move into the scene and certain clues show that this dialogue actually took place years before when their marriage was only twenty years old and Addie was still a child.\\" For one thing Beckett stipulates that she makes \\"[n]o sound as she sits.\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 97 Also beforehand she was aware of \\"the least feather of smoke on the horizon\\" but now \\"she cannot see the beach where Henry is sitting (‚Äòis there anyone about?‚Äô) without his words to describe it.\\"Robinson, M., The Long Sonata of the Dead: A Study of Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove Press, 1969), p 287 Their nature of their dialogue is odd too ‚Äì quite civilized ‚Äì considering the comment Henry made just before evoking her presence: \\"Ada too, conversation with her, that was something, that‚Äôs what hell will be like.\\" Evidently he is remembering better times here. Katharine Worth conjectures that Ada represents a kind of muse, \\"a hint stressed in the sound of her voice ‚Äì ‚Äòlow [and] remote throughout‚Äô ‚Äì and in the curious fact that she has been present in some mysterious way before he spoke her name.\\"Worth, K., ‚ÄòWomen in Beckett‚Äôs Radio and Television Plays‚Äô in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p 238 He calls on her because he needs her, his father doesn‚Äôt answer and he is struggling with his story on his own. Roger Blin, in an interview on 2 March 1975, in Paris, said: \\"Beckett absolutely didn't want me to try to do Embers for the theatre because, when you listen, you don't know if Ada exists or not, [or] whether she only exists in the imagination of the character Henry.\\"Oppenheim, L., Directing Beckett (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press), p 310 Ada is \\"immensely there\\", though, her personality is allowed to shine throughout her conversation with Henry; she doesn‚Äôt merely respond, she initiates lines of thought, she nags him like a mother with her list of don‚Äôts, jokes with him, reproves him in a matter-of-fact way and refuses to mollycoddle him. She doesn‚Äôt appear to take him very seriously either. Henry is obviously incapable of imagining her any other way than how she was when they were together, further evidence of his declining creative powers. Parts of their conversation, for example, sound as if they are simply reenactments of things said to each other when they were a couple but noticeably not all. Her advice to Henry that he seeks medical assistance from Holloway, assuming him to be \\"a figure in the fiction he [has been] weaving\\",Worth, K., ‚ÄòWomen in Beckett‚Äôs Radio and Television Plays‚Äô in Ben- Zvi, L., (Ed.) Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p 239 would add weight to the argument that Ada is both part imagined as well as part remembered. Having performed her function to the best of her plainly limited abilities she leaves him to it with a down-to-earth, \\"Is this rubbish a help to you, Henry? ‚Ä¶ No? Then I think I‚Äôll be getting back?\\" Conclusion In a letter to Alan Schneider dated 6 September 1959, after finally hearing a tape of the BBC production, Beckett wrote: \\"Good performance and production but doesn't come off. My fault, text too difficult.\\"Harmon, M.

Early life Born in Guadeloupe in the French West Indies, Petrus worked as a diesel-engine mechanic on a cargo ship aged 15. He subsequently travelled to Paris following his interest for R&B; and soul music, where he worked as a DJ at different clubs, including the jet-set nightclub Club Saint-Hilaire. In the early 1970s, he moved to Milan, Italy, and continued DJing at various clubs including Good Mood. In Bologna he met music student Mauro Malavasi, who became his working partner and main songwriter and producer, and together they formed a disco production company called Goody Music Productions (GMP), established a recording studio in Bologna, and created the Goody Music Records label. Career In 1978 Petrus and Malavasi launched their first studio project called Macho. There followed a series of releases under different names, including Elvin Shaad (1978), Peter Jacques band (1979), Revanche (1979), Rudy (album)Rudy (an album featuring the Italian Goody Music collaborator Rudy Trevisi), Midnight Gang (1979), A.N.T.I. Rock (1980) (an Italian version of Ottawan's disco hit \\"D.I.S.C.O.\\"), The Jumpers (1980), (1980) and Caprice (1980). In 1979 Petrus gathered his international music activities under the company name Little Macho Music. In 1980, Petrus and Malavasi established their signature sound under the name Change, a blend of eurodisco and American R&B-flavoured; disco inspired by Chic, releasing their debut album The Glow of Love. Petrus used two other Italian musicians on this album, bassist and guitarist . Romani wrote the number-one hits \\"A Lover's Holiday\\" and \\"The Glow of Love\\" (with vocals by Luther Vandross and Jocelyn Brown), and also arranged and conducted the entire set with Gianolio. \\"A Lover's Holiday\\" reached number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play for nine weeks, and the album also received seven Grammy Award nominations. After the success with Change, Petrus and Malavasi launched several new projects including The Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens band (B. B. & Q. band) in 1981, High Fashion (1982) (including the Romani/Malavasi composition \\"Feelin' lucky lately\\" which reached no.32 on Billboard's R&B; chart), Silence (a pop album released in 1982) and (1982). Petrus and his group of Italian studio musicians and writers also co-wrote and produced parts of The Ritchie Family's 1982 album '. The title track, written by Malavasi, became a club hit. The B. B. & Q. band was the most successful Petrus project after Change. Their self-titled 1981 debut album included \\"On the Beat\\" (written by Malavasi and Slade, a dance track that reached no.8 on the Billboard black singles charts. In the second half of the 1980s Petrus releases further albums by the B.B.&Q.; Band (1985), Peter Jacques Band (1985) and Change (1985). Less successful projects in 1984 and 1985 (often single releases) included Silence 2 feat. Gordon Grody (1984), Macho III (1984), Kevin Johnson (1984), Zinc feat. Sherwin (1984), M Like Moon (1984), Midnight Gang (1984), Tato (1985), Nobel (1985) and Persuader (1985). Due to tax problems in the United States, Petrus was forced to shut down Little Macho Music. In 1985 he started a new production company and record label called Renaissance International. Vedette International was the name of his new publishing company. Death In 1986 the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accused Petrus of tax evasion. Petrus put his music industry activities on hold and fled to Guadeloupe. Petrus was murdered in the spring of 1987 in Guadeloupe at the age of 39. French police reported that Petrus had been shot at home in the heights of Saint-F√©lix by a Swiss gunman, who had clashed with him earlier that night at L'Elys√©e Matignon club in Le Gosier, which Petrus owned.

It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter turn of the coupling nut. The dimensions of the connector are specified in the MIL-STD-348B. MHV connectors can be recognized by the slightly protruding insulation on the male plug and the slightly different insulation length in the female jack. Use The MHV connector is typically rated for 1500 RMS Continuous & 5000 .volt peak and 3 ampere.

Biography She was born in Esztergom, Kingdom of Hungary, the daughter of King B√©la IV of Hungary and Maria Laskarina. She was a niece of Elizabeth of Hungary and great-niece of Hedwig of Andechs. Kinga's sisters were Margaret of Hungary and Jolenta of Poland. She reluctantly married Boles≈Çaw V (\\"the Chaste\\") and became princess when her husband ascended the throne as High Duke of Poland. Despite the marriage, the devout couple took up a vow of chastity. The marriage was largely arranged by, and the vow of chastity patterned after that of Boles≈Çaw's sister, Salomea of Poland. During her reign Kinga got involved in charitable works such as visiting the poor and helping the lepers. When her husband died in 1279, she sold all her material possessions and gave the money to the poor. She soon did not want any part in governing the kingdom which was left to her, and decided to become a Poor Clare nun in the monastery at Sandec (Stary SƒÖcz). She would spend the rest of her life in contemplative prayer and did not allow anyone to refer to her past role as Grand Duchess of Poland. She died on 24 July 1292, aged 68. Veneration Pope Alexander VIII beatified Kinga in 1690. In 1695, she was made chief patroness of Poland and Lithuania. On 16 June 1999, she was canonized by Pope John Paul II. Legend Legend has it that Kinga threw her engagement ring into the Maramures salt mine in what was then Hungary. The ring miraculously traveled along with salt deposits to Wieliczka, where it was rediscovered. On this spot the miners erected a statue of Saint Kinga, carved entirely from salt, which is 101 meters under the Earth's surface.

Pilobolus has performed over 100 choreographic works in more than 64 countries around the world, and has been featured on the 79th Annual Academy Awards, The Oprah Winfrey Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Pilobolus Dance Theatre has three main branches: a touring company, Pilobolus, that creates new works through the International Collaborators Project; an educational programming arm that teaches the company's group-based creative process; and Pilobolus Creative Services, which offers movement services for film, advertising, publishing, commercial clients and corporate events. History Pilobolus is named after a phototropic fungus that Jonathan Wolken's father was studying in a lab at the time of the company's inception. The fungus grows on cow dung and propels itself with extraordinary strength, speed and accuracy. Pilobolus was founded by a group of Dartmouth College students in 1971. It has long been based in Washington Depot, Connecticut with offices in New York City and Belgium. The company tours domestically and internationally, performing works from its over 100-piece repertory as well as new pieces, created at a pace of about two per year. The founding members were Robby Barnett, Alison Becker Chase, Martha Clarke, Lee Harris, Moses Pendleton, Michael Tracy, and Jonathan Wolken. Harris departed around 1975, leaving six members: four men and two women.Music and Dance, Alan Rich, New York Magazine, Published Dec 19, 1977. In November 1977, Pilobolus made its Broadway debut in a limited engagement at the St. James Theater, to great acclaim. Arlene Croce, writing in the New Yorker, praised the group as \\"six of the most extraordinary people now performing.\\"Matson, Tim, Pilobolus (Random House, 1978), page 20. Martha Clarke left in 1978. Pendleton left in 1990 after having collaborated with Chase in 1980 to form the offshoot group Momix. The four remaining founders (Barnett, Chase, Tracy, and Wolken) continued as artistic directors, choreographing collectively and in various combinations in collaboration with new dancers brought into the company in subsequent years. Chase left in 2006 and has gone on to found her own company, Alison Chase Performance. Wolken died in 2010. Pilobolus performances are characterized by a strong element of physical interaction between the bodies of the performers and exaggerations or contortions of the human form (or other anthropomorphic forms), requiring extreme strength, flexibility and athleticism. From early on, the company \\"made a specialty of playful topsy- turvy entanglements that defied anatomical logic\\" and which sometimes \\"gave rise to bizarre imagery.\\"Reynolds, Nancy, and McCormick, Malcolm, No Fixed Points: Dance in the Twentieth Century (Yale University Press, 2003), page 610. This approach broke new ground, and soon \\"even choreographers who did not consciously borrow from the group enjoyed new license in bringing bodies (especially men) into closer physical contact\\"Reynolds, Nancy, and McCormick, Malcolm, No Fixed Points: Dance in the Twentieth Century (Yale University Press, 2003), pages 611-612. than previously. In 1980, Pilobolus performed \\"Black and Blue\\" with live music by the duo Stormin‚Äô Norman & Suzy Williams at The American Dance Festival, choreographing their dance based on Suzy's movements. In 1999, Pilobolus collaborated with Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks in the production of \\"A Selection\\", a work with the Holocaust as its theme, documented in the film Last Dance. In 2004 the company was the subject of a feature profile on CBS's 60 Minutes. In 2007 Pilobolus appeared as performers in the television broadcast of the 79th Academy Awards. Their act was done in silhouette behind a white translucent screen, where they formed various figures at intervals during the show: first, the Oscar statue itself; then logos (or scenes) from various films: Happy Feet, Little Miss Sunshine, Snakes on a Plane, The Devil Wears Prada, and The Departed. At one point, they were introduced to the audience, wearing loose-fitting wraps. The act for Snakes on a Plane included host Ellen DeGeneres, who said afterwards, \\"They're naked!\\" Whether she was joking or serious was left to the imagination. Following the company's appearance on the 79th Academy Awards, Pilobolus's signature shapes and shadow work were featured in 2008 on the 39th Season of Sesame Street, as well as on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Oprah Winfrey. In October 2012, Pilobolus premiered UP: The Umbrella Project, the company's second collaboration with Daniela Rus and the MIT Distributed Robotics Laboratory, at the PopTech Conference in Camden, Maine. Untrained participants wielding umbrellas fabricated with multi-colored LED lights, created a performance piece together that was projected in real time on a large screen. This Pilobolus piece, like all of the modern performance company's work over the last 42 years, was borne out of its proven method of collective creativity. Pilobolus appeared on the 7 December 2016 episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, doing holiday silhouettes to the tune of \\"Low Rider\\". International Collaborators Project In 2007, Pilobolus established the International Collaborators Project (ICP), in which the dance company teams up with visiting artists annually to expand its unique collective choreographic process. To celebrate this inaugural event, Pilobolus Artistic Director Robby Barnett invited star Israeli director and choreographer Inbal Pinto and her artistic collaborator, actor and designer Avshalom Pollak, that same year to join the company in its studios in Connecticut. Other ICP collaborators include musical duo B√©la Fleck and Abigail Washburn; writer and illustrator, Maurice Sendak; the puppeteer, Basil Twist; Pulitzer Prize-winner, comic artist Art Spiegelman; the Grammy-winning American composer and musician Dan Zanes; singer/composer David Poe; SpongeBob SquarePants head writer Steven Banks; the Grammy-winning band OK Go; the MIT Distributed Robotics Laboratory directed by Professor Daniela Rus; the Japanese butoh choreographer Takuya Muramatsu of the troupe Dairakudakan; WNYC's Radiolab with hosts Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich; the MacArthur ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù Award-winning juggler Michael Moschen; the Belgian-Moroccan choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui; award- winning director and choreographer, Trish Sie; master illusionists Penn & Teller; Israeli authors and filmmakers Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen; and multiplatinum songwriter/composer Alex Dezen Educational Programming Pilobolus classes and workshops use the art of collaborative choreography as a model for creative thinking in general. Pilobolus educational projects include a series of workshops for Avon Corporation in partnership with Deloitte, classes at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, and a program at the Babcock School at Wake Forest University. Every summer, the company offers several week-long adult workshops and runs a children's camp at its home in Washington Depot, CT. The company's youth development program, Movin‚Äô, in partnership with the Shubert Theater in New Haven, offers fully funded, month-long choreographic programs for middle school boys and girls. Based on Movin's success, Pilobolus has launched multiple programs for middle and high school students in New York City public schools. After co-founder Jonathan Wolken died in 2010, Pilobolus established the Jonathan Wolken Education Fund to help spread the spirit of his teaching and methods. Pilobolus Creative Services Pilobolus Creative Services provides movement design and production for commercial applications in business and advertising. PCS has made television spots for Mobil, Ford, Toyota, Opel, Hyundai, Multicentrum, BBVA, Bidvest, and Procter & Gamble ‚Äì including an Emmy-Nominated piece for the NFL Network ‚Äì and created live events for IBM, McKinsey, United Technologies, Dupont, Merck, and Google. PCS created and presented six acclaimed performances during the 79th Annual Academy Awards, and produced a series of original segments for the Oprah Winfrey Show and Late Night with Conan O‚ÄôBrien. PCS produced two books for national distribution, Twisted Yoga and The Human Alphabet. Calendar and Still Photography Beginning in 2000, Pilobolus published an annual wall calendar featuring original photography created to further explore and celebrate the company's artistic sensibility. An introductory text to the 2008 calendar noted that the company had been ‚Äúexperimenting with still photography since the 1980s‚Äù to address the question ‚ÄúHow can one select individual moments from a continuum and have them retain meaning?‚Äù The introduction also noted that the group's ‚Äúchoreographic inquiry is driven by a fascination with images‚Äù that are, or become, ‚Äúthe fundamental units of our physical vocabulary.‚Äù Rather than attempting to document their live performances, the calendar photo shoots represented \\"a sort of annual gallery of our evolving understanding of the relationship between choreographic and photographic expression.\\" ‚ÄúPilobolus: Artifactory,‚Äù introductory essay, unsigned, in Pilobolus 2008 calendar (Verve Editions, 2008). Almost all of the calendars, which were produced for eleven consecutive years (from 2000-2010) and again in 2012, were photographed by John Kane, the company's longtime friend and collaborator on photography projects.As credited in bylines, copyright lines, and other acknowledgements on the Pilobolus calendars. An exception was the 2009 Pilobolus calendar, created while the company was on tour in Israel in January 2008, in collaboration with the Israeli Consulate in New York. Photographer Robert Whitman captured Pilobolus in a variety of colorful Israeli landscapes, including the Dead Sea, Old Jaffa, markets in Jerusalem, hot springs, and the streets of Haifa.. Shadowland After its shadow theater performance on the 79th Annual Academy Awards, Pilobolus embarked on the creation of an evening-length movement-theater piece titled Shadowland. It was created in collaboration with Steven Banks, head writer for the hit Nickelodeon show ‚ÄúSpongeBob SquarePants,‚Äù and singer-songwriter David Poe, who wrote the score. Since its debut in 2009, Shadowland has sold over 450,000 tickets world-wide. Company As of 2020, the Pilobolus company is composed of Nathaniel Buchsbaum, Krystal Butler, Quincy Ellis, Casey Howes, Paul Liu, Justin Norris, and dance captain Heather Favretto. Renee Jaworski and Matt Kent serve as co-artistic directors.

Ge≈çgraphik·∏ï Hyph·∏ógƒìsis, 2:7:9 The name Lemovices means 'those who vanquish by the elm' (probably the wood from which were made their lances or bows), stemming from Gaulish lemo- ('elm') attached to the suffix -uices ('victors'). The Gaulish root lemo- derives from Proto-Celtic *lƒìmo- or *limo- (compare with Old Irish lem, Middle Welsh liwyfen 'elm'), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÅ√©lem or *h‚ÇÅleym- ('elm'; compare with Latin ulmus 'elm', Old Norse almr 'elm, bow', or Russian il'm 'mountain elm'). The city of Limoges, attested as civitas Lemovicum ca. 400 CE ('civitas of the Lemovices', Lemovicas in 844, Lemotges in 1208), and the Limousin region, attested as Lemovicinum in the 6th c. CE (pago Lemovicino in 860, Lemozi in 1071‚Äì1127), are named after the Gallic tribe.  History  They established themselves in Limousin and Poitou between 700 and 400 BC. In 52 BC, some 10,000 Lemovician combatants fought against Julius Caesar at the Battle of Alesia as allies to the Arverni under Vercingetorix. Their chief, Sedullos, was killed during the battle.  Geography  = Settlements = Their capital was originally Durotincum (Villejoubert). After their incorporation into the Roman province of Aquitania, Augustoritum (Limoges) was the capital of the civitas Lemovicum. In the 1st c. CE, it was administered by the vergobretus, and later by a duumviri. Briva Curretia (Brive; from Gaulish briua 'bridge'), Blatomago (Blond) and Carovicus (Ch√¢teau-Chervix) were known vici ('villages') within the Lemovices' territory. Other locations associated with them were Acitodunum (23-Ahun), Argentate (19-Argentat), Cassinomagus (16-Chassenon), Roncomagus (87-Rancon), Excingidiacum (19-Yssandon) et Uxellum (19-Ussel).

Archaeologists during the latter part of the 19th century found gold mines in the Lemovices' settlement in Limousin, particularly in the south-western region of the Massif Central in west-central France. This discovery allowed the identification of techniques and the chronology of the mining activity because the Lemovices did not mention their mining heritage and their gold.

The computer program will automatically generate orders based on predefined set of rules using a trading strategy which is based on technical analysis, advanced statistical and mathematical computations or input from other electronic sources. Automated trading systems are often used with electronic trading in automated market centers, including electronic communication networks, \\"dark pools\\", and automated exchanges. Automated trading systems and electronic trading platforms can execute repetitive tasks at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human equivalent. Traditional risk controls and safeguards that relied on human judgment are not appropriate for automated trading and this has caused issues such as the 2010 Flash Crash. New controls such as trading curbs or 'circuit breakers' have been put in place in some electronic markets to deal with automated trading systems. Mechanism The automated trading system determines whether an order should be submitted based on, for example, the current market price of an option and theoretical buy and sell prices. The theoretical buy and sell prices are derived from, among other things, the current market price of the security underlying the option. A look-up table stores a range of theoretical buy and sell prices for a given range of current market price of the underlying security. Accordingly, as the price of the underlying security changes, a new theoretical price may be indexed in the look-up table, thereby avoiding calculations that would otherwise slow automated trading decisions.Marynowski, John M., et al. \\"Automated trading system in an electronic trading exchange.\\" U.S. Patent No. 7,251,629. 31 Jul. 2007.

Advantages of Automated Trading System *Minimizes Emotion As orders are processed automatically once the pre-set rules are satisfied, emotional mistakes are minimized. It also helps traders to stay disciplined when the market is highly volatile. *Ability to Backtest Before actually using the automated trading or the underlying algorithm, traders are able to evaluate their rules using the old data. It allows the traders to minimize potential mistakes and determine the expected returns. *Achieves Consistency As orders are processed only when the pre-set rules are satisfied and traders only trade by plan, it helps the traders achieve consistency. *Improved Order Entry Speed As computers process the orders as soon as the pre-set rules are met, it achieves higher order entry speed which is extremely beneficial in the current market where market conditions can change very rapidly. *Diversifies Trading Automated trading systems allow users to simultaneously trade in multiple accounts which allows them to diversify their portfolio. Diversifying the portfolio allows the users to minimize their risks by spreading the risk over various instruments. Disadvantages of Automated Trading System *Mechanical Failures Even though the underlying algorithm is capable of performing well in the live market, an internet connection malfunction could lead to a failure. *Monitoring Although the computer is processing the orders, it still needs to be monitored because it is susceptible to technology failures as shown above. *Over-Optimization An algorithm that performs very well on backtesting could end up performing very poorly in the live market. Good performance on backtesting could lead to overly optimistic expectations from the traders which could lead to big failures. Strategies *Trend following \\"The most common strategy which is implemented by following the trend in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements, and related technical indicators\\". For example, the following formula could be used for trend following strategy: :\\"Consider a complete probability space (Œ©, F, P). Let S_r denote the stock price at time r satisfying the equation :dS_r = S_r[\\\\mu (\\\\alpha _r)dr + \\\\sigma dB_r], S_t = X, t \\\\leq r \\\\leq T < \\\\infty , :where \\\\alpha _r \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} is a two-state Markov-Chain, \\\\mu (i) \\\\equiv \\\\mu _i is the expected return rate in regime i = 1,2, \\\\sigma > 0 is the constant volatility, B_r is a standard Brownian motion, and t and T are the initial and terminal times, respectively\\". *Volume-weighted average price \\"Volume weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the market using stock- specific historical volume profiles.\\" According to Volume-weighted average price Wikipedia page, VWAP is calculated using the following formula: \\":P_{\\\\mathrm{VWAP}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j}{P_j \\\\cdot Q_j}}{\\\\sum_j{Q_j}} \\\\, where: :P_{\\\\mathrm{VWAP}} is Volume Weighted Average Price; :P_j is price of trade j; :Q_j is quantity of trade j; :j is each individual trade that takes place over the defined period of time, excluding cross trades and basket cross trades\\". *Mean reversion (finance) This strategy is based on the idea that the values/prices of assets will revert to their mean prices/values. \\"A continuous mean-reverting time series can be represented by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation: : dx_t = \\\\theta(\\\\mu -x_t)dt + \\\\sigma dW_t Where \\\\theta is the rate of reversion to the mean, \\\\mu is the mean value of the process, \\\\sigma is the variance of the process and W_t is a Wiener Process or Brownian Motion\\".  History  The concept of automated trading system was first introduced by Richard Donchian in 1949 when he used a set of rules to buy and sell the funds. Then, in the 1980s, the concept of rule based trading became more popular when famous traders like John Henry began to use such strategies. In the mid 1990s, some models were available for purchase. Also, improvements in technology increased the accessibility for retail investors. Early form of Automated Trading System, software based on algorithm, has been used by financial managers and brokers. These kinds of software were used to automatically manage clients' portfolios. However, first service to free market without any supervision was first launched in 2008 which was Betterment by Jon Stein. Since then, this system has been improving with the development in the IT industry. Now, Automated Trading System is managing huge assets all around the globe. In 2014, more than 75 percent of the stock shares traded on United States exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ) originated from automated trading system orders.  Applications  *How it Works Automated trading system can be based on a predefined set of rules which determine when to enter an order, when to exit a position, and how much money to invest in each trading product. Trading strategies differ such that while some are designed to pick market tops and bottoms, others follow a trend, and others involve complex strategies including randomizing orders to make them less visible in the marketplace. ATSs allow a trader to execute orders much quicker and to manage their portfolio easily by automatically generating protective precautions. *Backtesting Backtesting of a trading system involves programmers running the program by using historical market data in order to determine whether the underlying algorithm can produce the expected results. Backtesting software enables a trading system designer to develop and test their trading systems by using historical market data and optimizing the results obtained with the historical data. Although backtesting of automated trading systems cannot accurately determine future results, an automated trading system can be backtested by using historical prices to see how the system would have performed theoretically if it had been active in a past market environment.https://www.tradestation.com/~/media/Files/TradeStation/Education/University/School%20of%20Strategy%20Trading/Books/Designing%20and%20Using%20Strategies.ashxChapter 3 *Forward Testing Forward testing of an algorithm can also be achieved using simulated trading with real-time market data to help confirm the effectiveness of the trading strategy in the current market. It may be used to reveal issues inherent in the computer code. *Live Testing Live testing is the final stage of the development cycle. In this stage, live performance is compared against the backtested and walk forward results. Metrics compared include Percent Profitable, Profit Factor, Maximum Drawdown and Average Gain per Trade. The goal of an automated trading system is to meet or exceed the backtested performance with a high efficiency rating.  Market disruption and manipulation  Automated trading, or high-frequency trading, causes regulatory concerns as a contributor to market fragility. United States regulators have published releases discussing several types of risk controls that could be used to limit the extent of such disruptions, including financial and regulatory controls to prevent the entry of erroneous orders as a result of computer malfunction or human error, the breaching of various regulatory requirements, and exceeding a credit or capital limit. The use of high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies has grown substantially over the past several years and drives a significant portion of activity on U.S. markets. Although many HFT strategies are legitimate, some are not and may be used for manipulative trading. A strategy would be illegitimate or even illegal if it causes deliberate disruption in the market or tries to manipulate it. Such strategies include \\"momentum ignition strategies\\": spoofing and layering where a market participant places a non-bona fide order on one side of the market (typically, but not always, above the offer or below the bid) in an attempt to bait other market participants to react to the non-bona fide order and then trade with another order on the other side of the market. They are also referred to as predatory/abusive strategies. Given the scale of the potential impact that these practices may have, the surveillance of abusive algorithms remains a high priority for regulators. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has reminded firms using HFT strategies and other trading algorithms of their obligation to be vigilant when testing these strategies pre- and post-launch to ensure that the strategies do not result in abusive trading. FINRA also focuses on the entry of problematic HFT and algorithmic activity through sponsored participants who initiate their activity from outside of the United States. In this regard, FINRA reminds firms of their surveillance and control obligations under the SEC's Market Access Rule and Notice to Members 04-66, as well as potential issues related to treating such accounts as customer accounts, anti-money laundering, and margin levels as highlighted in Regulatory Notice 10-18 and the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examination's National Exam Risk Alert dated September 29, 2011.https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/riskalert-mastersubaccounts.pdf FINRA conducts surveillance to identify cross-market and cross-product manipulation of the price of underlying equity securities. Such manipulations are done typically through abusive trading algorithms or strategies that close out pre-existing option positions at favorable prices or establish new option positions at advantageous prices. In recent years, there have been a number of algorithmic trading malfunctions that caused substantial market disruptions. These raise concern about firms' ability to develop, implement, and effectively supervise their automated systems. FINRA has stated that it will assess whether firms' testing and controls related to algorithmic trading and other automated trading strategies are adequate in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and firms' supervisory obligations. This assessment may take the form of examinations and targeted investigations. Firms will be required to address whether they conduct separate, independent, and robust pre-implementation testing of algorithms and trading systems. Also, whether the firm's legal, compliance, and operations staff are reviewing the design and development of the algorithms and trading systems for compliance with legal requirements will be investigated. FINRA will review whether a firm actively monitors and reviews algorithms and trading systems once they are placed into production systems and after they have been modified, including procedures and controls used to detect potential trading abuses such as wash sales, marking, layering, and momentum ignition strategies. Finally, firms will need to describe their approach to firm-wide disconnect or \\"kill\\" switches, as well as procedures for responding to catastrophic system malfunctions. = Notable examples = Examples of recent substantial market disruptions include the following: * On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined about 1,000 points (about 9 percent) and recovered those losses within minutes. It was the second-largest point swing (1,010.14 points) and the largest one-day point decline (998.5 points) on an intraday basis in the Average's history. This market disruption became known as the Flash Crash and resulted in U.S. regulators issuing new regulations to control market access achieved through automated trading. * On August 1, 2012, between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. EDT, Knight Capital Group lost four times its 2011 net income. Knight's CEO Thomas Joyce stated, on the day after the market disruption, that the firm had \\"all hands on deck\\" to fix a bug in one of Knight's trading algorithms that submitted erroneous orders to exchanges for nearly 150 different stocks. Trading volumes soared in so many issues, that the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF (SYMBOL: SPY), which is generally the most heavily traded U.S. security, became the 52nd-most traded stock on that day, according to Eric Hunsader, CEO of market data service Nanex. Knight shares closed down 62 percent as a result of the trading error and Knight Capital nearly collapsed. Knight ultimately reached an agreement to merge with Getco, a Chicago-based high-speed trading firm.

The connector uses a bayonet mount similar to those of the BNC and MHV connectors, but is easily distinguished due to its very thick and protruding insulator. This insulation geometry makes SHV connectors safer for handling high voltage than MHV connectors, by preventing accidental contact with the live conductor in an unmated connector or plug. The connector is also designed such that when it is being disconnected from a plug, the high voltage contact is broken before the ground contact, to prevent accidental shocks. The connector is also designed to prevent users from forcing a high voltage connector into a low voltage plug or vice versa (as can happen with MHV and BNC connectors), by reversing the gender compared to BNC. Details of the connector comprising dimensions of the mating parts, voltage rating, minimum insulation requirements and more are specified by the IEC document 60498. SHV connectors are used in laboratory settings for voltages and currents beyond the capacity of BNC and MHV connectors. Standard SHV connectors are rated for 5000 volts DC and 5 amperes, although higher-voltage versions (to 20 kV) are also available. SHV connectors are not as common as the older MHV type.

Like other California cardrooms, Bay 101 offers poker cash games and tournaments as well as special \\"California\\" style table games. Bay 101 is perhaps best known for hosting the Bay 101 Shooting Star, a World Poker Tour tournament created by Bay 101 owner Marko Trapani in 1997. The Bay 101 Shooting Star is a major bounty tournament, and the only one of its type on the World Poker Tour. History In 1929, Joseph Sutter Sr. purchased the Panama Inn in Alviso, which he would rename as Sutter's Club. Sutter's son, Joseph Sutter Jr., took over the establishment in 1947, and added poker tables in 1961. In 1989, Caltrans released plans for widening of Highway 237 that would require demolishing the club. A group of investors including Berryessa Flea Market owner Jeff Bumb announced a plan to acquire a 49 percent interest in Sutter's Place and move it to a new, larger facility. The move would have been prohibited under a 1978 city law intended to phase out card rooms by ending issuance of new licenses and transfers of existing licenses. However, Bumb's group successfully lobbied the city council to amend the law to allow Sutter's to move to a new location and expand to 40 tables. Sutter's closed in June 1992. Initial plans called for it to move to the Italian Gardens complex near Downtown San Jose, but negotiations with the site owner failed. Developers instead selected a site in an industrial area near Highway 101. A contest was held to choose a new name for the casino, and Bay 101 was selected out of 7,400 entries. The cardroom was built at its new location at a cost of $15 million. Bay 101 held a grand opening in November 1993, but could not offer gaming because background checks for the owners' gaming license had not been completed; only the restaurants and bar were operating. As the licensing process dragged on, the club was closed and its 600 employees were laid off in December. The state Department of Justice eventually denied Bay 101's license application because of alleged failures to disclose certain financial information, and other reasons that were not made public. The shareholders then agreed to sell their stakes in the business to brothers Tim Bumb and George Bumb Jr., who had previously been only passive investors, and were seen as the most likely to successfully appeal the state's decision. Under the sole ownership of Tim and George, Bay 101 received a provisional gaming license in August 1994. The card room finally opened and dealt its first games on September 9, 1994. Bay 101 announced plans in 2013 to move across the freeway to the site of the San Jose Airport Hotel, near the new location of the city's other cardroom, Casino M8trix. The Bumb family had purchased the hotel in 2012 for more than $20 million, in anticipation of the cardroom's lease coming to an end in 2017. An alternative plan emerged in June 2014, as Bay 101 lobbied for permission to move to Milpitas, where it would pay a lower tax rate and be allowed to expand to 115 tables. That plan was rejected, however, by Milpitas voters. The Airport Hotel was demolished in December 2015 to make way for Bay 101's new $100-million casino, hotel, and, office complex. The first phase of the new complex, comprising the casino and a restaurant, opened in September 2017.

Corrupt politician and drug dealer Antor Trelig is aware of Zinder's work through the efforts of Zinder's assistant, Ben Yulin. Trelig takes Zinder's daughter hostage and forces Zinder and Yulin to build a computer that can control the Markovian forces, like the dead Markovian computers that have been found on some planets.

Mavra Chang, freighter pilot and secret agent, is hired to rescue Zinder and halt Trelig's plans of universal conquest. In the process Obie accidentally makes contact with the Well World, which results in the entire planetoid being automatically transported into orbit around the Well World. Mavra and Zinder are aboard a spacecraft when this occurs, and find themselves flying over a \\"non-tech\\" hex.

Having worked as a TV host on the Danish TV channel DR's children's show KatjaKaj og BenteBent, and directed several music videos, he eventually directed the feature film Princess in 2006, earning him a Nordisk Film Award. Prior to this, comic strip Wulffmorgenthaler produced in collaboration with comedian Mikael Wulff, brought attention and success in 2001. A comic strip competition entry named Kalzone, completed few hours before the entry deadline, submitted under the pseudonym Pernille Richter Andersson, led to victory in the competition, and a one-month run in the national newspaper Politiken. The strip became a regular feature on DR's internet culture portal in 2002, and in October 2003 it became a daily newspaper strip in Politiken. Due to the unusually uninhibited and adult nature of the strip, this led to disgruntled reader reactions and cancelled subscriptions for Politiken, but the strip remained. It later became syndicated to Swedish tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet in 2006. English versions of the strip also feature as a popular webcomic, and TV shows centered on the recurring character Dolph, a blue fascist hippopotamus, has been produced in various incarnations on DR.

Football career Baker comes from Leeds, and played for four years with Leeds City Boys. He was originally on the books of Leeds United as a schoolboy. However, he was signed as an apprentice at Hull City in 1996 and progressed through the youth ranks and turned professional in 1998. However, he suffered an horrendous knee injury which sidelined him for a season, but he eventually made two substitute appearances for the first team. He also made a sub appearance in the League Cup against Liverpool at Anfield, after Lee Bracey was sent off. He was released, after a spell on loan at Bradford Park Avenue, in 2000. He was snapped up by Hereford United of the Conference, where he was second choice goalkeeper to Scott Cooksey in the 2000‚Äì01 season, although he started two league matches conceding a goal in each. However a serious wrist injury forced Cooksey onto the sidelines, and eventually into retirement, meaning Baker started the 2001‚Äì02 season as first choice keeper where he impressed. He quickly established himself in the team and played all but five first team matches that season. Most notably he had an inspired Man-of-the-Match performance in the FA Cup against future club Wrexham, a match which was televised live by the BBC, as Hereford won 1‚Äì0. The following season he gained experience training with Aston Villa, and was an ever-present in the first team where he repeated this consistency in the 2003‚Äì04 season when Hereford came close to promotion to the Football League, a season which turned out to be his last for Hereford. During this period he also made four appearances for his country by representing the England National Game XI. In the summer of 2004 he signed for Wrexham. However, he spent only six months at the Racecourse Ground before signing for MK Dons, for whom he quickly became a fans favourite, and helped them survive relegation in his first season, and went on to make over 60 first team appearances. Two years later he signed for Conference side Weymouth on a free transfer. However, due to severe financial troubles, at the Terras, he never made a first team appearance. On 2 March 2007 he was loaned to Rushden & Diamonds where he finished the season as number 1. On 20 July he joined Macclesfield Town on trial but despite again impressing was forced to retire from the game in August 2007 due to a reoccurrence of a knee injury. Shortly afterwards he became a presenter for Dons World, the Milton Keynes Dons' official web TV station,\\"Baker back as a Dons reporter\\" having started a degree in Sports Journalism & Broadcasting in 2006.\\"Sporting new degree kicks off at Staffs\\" He graduated with a degree from Staffordshire University in summer of 2008 and now works as a sports journalist for The Sun newspaper and BBC local radio stations.

With a recorded history that pre-dates the rest of the city, North Omaha has roots back to 1812 with the founding of Fort Lisa. It includes the Mormon settlement of Cutler's Park and Winter Quarters in 1846, a lynching before the turn-of-the-twentieth- century, the thriving 24th Street community of the 1920s, the bustling development of the African-American community through the 1950s, a series of riots in the 1960s, and redevelopment in the late 20th and early 21st century. Pre-European contact Bands from the Pawnee, Otoe and Sioux nations were the first to occupy the area around Carter Lake. After a short period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when they were the most powerful Indians on the Great Plains, the Omaha nation settled in the vicinity of present-day East Omaha. After a smallpox epidemic killed much of its population, and encroaching American settlement further reduced their historic way of life, the Omaha sold their lands and moved to their present reservation to the north in Thurston County, Nebraska in 1856. Mid-19th century The first settlements in North Omaha were the 1812 Fort Lisa located near Hummel Park and the 1823 Cabann√©'s Trading Post along the Missouri River. Fort Lisa was built by famed fur trapper Manuel Lisa, a founder of the St. Louis, Missouri Fur Company (later known as the Missouri Fur Company). It was an important fur trading post for securing initial American investment in the Louisiana Territory. Cabann√©'s Trading Post belonged to John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company, which competed with many traders for the patronage of local Native American tribes. The American Fur Company later bought out Fontenelle's Post, founded by the Missouri Fur Company. Fontenelle's Post became the start of Bellevue, the first town in Nebraska. =Early towns= Founded in August 1846, Cutler's Park was an early tent settlement for pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were on their way from Nauvoo to Salt Lake City, Utah.Gail Holmes, \\"Early Latter-day Saints - Settlement Cutler's Park\\", Early LDS, Sep 2006, accessed 2 Sep 2008 Although the Mormons had permission from the US government to occupy land temporarily, Native American tribes argued about whether they should pay a fee or taxes. The Mormons had been putting up hay for the winter from the grasslands. The disagreement between the Oto and Omaha over the Mormons' use of the land persuaded the pioneers to move that fall three miles (5 km) east to a bluff by the Missouri River where the Oto did not demand a tax. There they created a settlement called the Winter Quarters. Here the Mormons built shelters for the winter: 800 cabins and sod huts. The settlement included a store, bank and town square, and by the spring a gristmill, which became called Florence Mill. The town effectively ceased to exist in 1848, after the entire population had continued their trek west. In 1854 James C. Mitchell bought the site and founded Florence, which was incorporated two years later. The town was an important stocking point for settlers heading west on the California Trail. The early town included banks, a post office, a large mill, several bars, and other important businesses. Today the Bank of Florence is recognized as the oldest building in Omaha. Brigham Young was believed to have helped build the Florence Mill. Annexed by Omaha in 1917, the community is at the far north end of North Omaha. South of Florence was a town founded in 1856 for speculators from New York. The Town of Saratoga was located in the proximity of North 24th Street and Ames Avenue. Its economy relied on its connection to the Saratoga Bend on the Missouri River, less than one mile (1.6 km) away. At its peak the town had its own post office, a hotel and several businesses, including its own brewery, along with more than 60 homes. For a few years, it was regarded as being larger than either of its neighboring towns of Omaha City or Florence. In between Saratoga and Florence was a wide, smooth plain. In the mid-1850s a large group of Irish immigrants built dugouts and sod houses in this area, which other settlers derisively labeled \\"Gophertown.\\" Residents of Florence and Gophertown skirmished violently in 1856; however, no major change resulted.Bristow, D. (2002) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Omaha in the 19th Century. Caxton Press. The Irish became well-established in Omaha, building economic and political power before the waves of European immigrants and black migrants arrived at the end of the 19th century. Many created an ethnic enclave in Sheelytown in South Omaha, near work at the stockyards and meatpacking plants. Scriptown was an area of North Omaha bound by 16th street on the east, 24th on the west, and Lake Street to the north. It was originally platted in 1855 to provide land to Nebraska Territory legislators who voted for Nebraska statehood. Consequently, the area was developed quickly, and included a number of prominent homes.(n.d.)\\"Andreas' History of Nebraska: Douglas County\\". From its development following the Scriptown platting, North Omaha was the dominion of a mixed European immigrant community that mingled extensively with the African-American community that grew around the start of the 20th century. The Jewish community in the area was rich, with several synagogues the provided social and cultural activities. The B'nai Jacob Synagogue was located at North 25th and Nicholas Streets; the B'nai Israel Synagogue was at North 18th and Chicago Streets; and the Adass Yeshuren Synagogue was at North 25th and Seward Streets. There are several Jewish cemeteries in the area as well.(1948) Checker Cab Directory. p. 26. Retrieved 8/4/07. Other early communities in the area included Casey's Row, an early community of housing for African-American families, most of whose men were employed as porters at the Union Pacific railyards to the east.(1981) \\"Project Prospect: A youth investigation of blacks buried at Prospect Cemetery\\" Girls Club of Omaha Squatter's Row was another residential area, located between North 11th and North 13th Streets, from Nicholas to Locust Streets, behind the Storz Brewery.

Late 19th century Night view of the Grand Court. Photograph by Frank Rinehart, 1898. The rest of the area comprising modern-day North Omaha developed in spurts. The Near North Side, closest to downtown, developed quickly in this period with many homes for working-class European immigrant and African American families. Early businesses and housing were propelled by the introduction of a horse-driven street railroad in the 1870s, and electrical streetcar lines operated in North Omaha until 1955.(n.d.) Transportation Page Omaha Exchange Many early businesses in North Omaha were established by Jewish immigrants,Olsen, T. (1995) Tell Me a Riddle (Women Writers : Texts and Contexts) Rutgers University Press. who became part of the larger community of successful business people who built downtown Omaha. In 1875, the Omaha Driving Park Association purchased a parcel of land located between Laird and Boyd Streets, and 16th to 20th Streets for horse racing, specifically, trotters. A fair association leased it, added some features, and held the Douglas County Fair and the Nebraska State Fair there for many years. The park fell into disuse by 1899; there is a report that this area was re- opened as Sunset Driving Park in 1904.(n.d.) Omaha Driving Park Track Info The GEL Motorsport Information Page. During this period early Omaha banker Herman Kountze owned a large parcel of land in North Omaha, which he platted as a subdivision called Kountze Place. On May 17, 1883, Buffalo Bill founded his famous Wild West, Rocky Mountain and Prairie Exhibition in that area, making its first appearance at the aforementioned Omaha Driving Park.(n.d.) Omaha Timeline 1880-1889 Douglas County Historical Society More than 8,000 people attended the first exhibition at a location near 18th and Sprague Streets. Buffalo Bill's Wild West show later returned to North Omaha for the Trans- Mississippi Exposition in 1898.(n.d.)Buffalo Bill at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition and Indian Congress of 1898. Nebraska State Historical Society. Held in conjunction with the Expo, the Indian Congress drew more than 500 American Indians representing 35 tribes to the area, as well. Kountze Place developed after the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, with developments including large homes and several mansions built around the Expo's only remnant, Kountze Park. Lake Nakoma, now known as Carter Lake, was a hotbed of local sporting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The lake and surrounding park featured sailing events, rowing clubs, Bungalow City, and the Omaha Gun Club.Historical postcard from the Omaha Gun Club Miller Park was an early site for golfing and boating, and Kountze Park featured several outdoor activities, as well. Also in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many European Jewish immigrants became involved in the Progressive and socialist movements. Some later became labor organizers in the meatpacking industry, which after two efforts, finally organized in the late 1930s and early 40s. Catholic parishes grew extensively with new Irish and German immigrant families.Street of Dreams Nebraska Public Television The importance of several arterial streets was confirmed in a prominent business journal in 1890, that noted, \\"North Sixteenth, Cuming and North Twenty-fourth streets on the north and northwest are... prominent business streets, radiating from the commercial center into the resident portions of the city.\\"(1890) Nebraska State Gazetteer Business Directory & Farmer's List .

It cut a path of destruction through the city that was seven miles (11 km) long and a quarter of a mile wide. In the city as a whole, 140 people died and 400 were injured. Twenty-three hundred people were homeless; with 800 houses destroyed and 2000 damaged. Sing, T (2003) Omaha's Easter Tornado of 1913. Arcadia Publishing. In the 1913 Easter Sunday Tornado, the Idlewild Pool Hall at 2307 North 24th Street was the scene of the greatest loss of life. The owner, C. W. Dillard, and 13 customers were killed as they tried to take shelter on the south side of the pool hall's basement. The victims were crushed by falling debris or overcome by smoke from fires begun when wood stoves used for heating overturned. North 24th Street was laid waste. The victims were removed to the Webster Telephone Exchange Building.(n.d.)1913 Easter Sunday Tornado Omaha Public Library The building was a central headquarters as the community recovered. Operators went to work despite the building missing all of its windows.(n.d.)Omaha's Terrible Evening. Tragic Story of America's Greatest Disaster. Starting with the development of the Minne Lusa neighborhood, in the 1910s the area near Florence became home to an almost exclusively Danish immigrant community. With a variety of churches and social clubs, the neighborhood was the cultural center for many of North Omaha's working class and middle-class whites. The North Omaha Business Men's Association made numerous contributions to Omaha commerce, culture, and education. The group was responsible for developing a new athletic field at Omaha University in 1928.(n.d.) Football University of Nebraska at Omaha Alumni Association Recruited for jobs by the meatpacking industry, African American migrants doubled their population in Omaha between 1910 and 1920, with a population among western cities second only to Los Angeles. By the late 19th century, the community already had three churches, which contributed much to its life. The African-American community culture in North Omaha developed a musical legacy of blues and jazz through the 1950s. In 1938 Mildred Brown and her husband founded the Omaha Star newspaper, since 1945 the only black paper in the state. Brown kept it going by herself for more than 40 years until her death in 1989. Since her death, her niece took it over. In the 1930s and 40s, the black community together with white labor organizing partners worked against the segregated practices of the meatpacking plants. Through their organizing the interracial United Packinghouse Workers of America, part of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), they began to win concessions from management. The UPWA was integrated and progressive, also supporting integration of public facilities in Omaha, and the larger Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. From the early 1930s through the 1950s, the Reed Ice Cream Company operated 63 small \\"ice cream bungalows\\" that distributed their ice cream across Omaha, including dozens in this neighborhood. One of the bungalows was located 620 N. 40th Street. Co-founded in 1929 by Claude Reed, and his business partner Christian F. Becker, the company plant was located at 3106 N 24th Street. The company sold ice cream in Omaha and Council Bluffs, with a volume of up to 22,000 cones a day. By 1955 there were a few commercial buildings along Ames Avenue and North 30th Street. Two businesses along North 30th Street included the Wax Paper Products Company and the Independent Biscuit Company.Reconnaissance Survey of Select Nebraska Communities Restructuring of the railroad and meatpacking industries resulted in massive job losses, more than 10,000, for working-class people in Omaha. Changes started to affect the neighborhood in the late 1960s. Families who remained became more poor and the area became predominantly black. Demographics have continued to change, but the city's improving economy has allowed reinvestment in the community. Other businesses in North Omaha included the Vercruysse Dairy, located on the southwest corner of North 52nd Street and Ames Avenue, the Omaha Safe Deposit and Trust Company, and the J.F. Smith Brickyard located on North 30th Street. Other historically significant businesses included the Storz Brewery, which was located at the corners of Sherman Avenue (also called 16th Street) and Clark Street and finished in 1894. The Storz Brewery was tall and had a capacity of 150,000 barrels a year, making it one of the largest breweries in the region. The entire facility occupied more than 15 buildings with red-tiled floors and walls, burnished stainless steel and copper fixtures.Storz Brewery History The Minne Lusa Theater was a one-screen neighborhood movie house that opened in the mid-1930s along North 30th Street that seated 400.(nd) Minne Lusa Theater. Cinema Treasures. Retrieved 6/11/07. In the 1940s, North Omaha was the home to the African-American players of the Omaha Rockets independent baseball team. The team played exhibition games against Negro League teams from across the U.S. It had several important players.(n.d.) Mickey Stubblefield Profile(n.d.) Barnstorming & Tournament Ball In 1947 a total of 15,000 people worked in the meatpacking industry in Omaha. By 1957, fully half the city's workforce worked in the meatpacking industry. In the 1950s, the United Packinghouse Workers used their economic and political strength to demand that Omaha's bars, restaurants, and other establishments halt segregationist restrictions. As the packing industry changed in the 1960s and moved operations closer to the meat producers, Omaha lost 10,000 jobs. This meant a loss of political power as well for African Americans and other working-class people. Although new meat packers have opened some new operations in Omaha, unionization has dropped sharply in the two decades after 1980, and African Americans have gained few of the new jobs.[Bacon, David (2005) \\"And the Winner Is... Immigration reform on the killing room floor\\" The American Prospect.23 Oct 2005] Accessed 11.10.05 Historical residences North Omaha's earliest homes were built in the Florence area soon after Winter Quarters were disassembled. Its first identification as a distinct bedroom suburb of Omaha occurred in the early 1870s, when professionals who worked in downtown Omaha built their homes a mile north of downtown Omaha,.(n.d.) Art Work of Omaha - 32nd Street, 39th Street (n.d.) Yates Residence For many years it was home to several prominent Omaha families, businesses, and organizations,(n.d.) Historic Families Douglas County Historical Society and in 1887 North Omaha was annexed to the city of Omaha. Early north Omaha residential developments were mostly occupied by European immigrants from Ireland and Eastern Europe, as evidenced by the construction of the churches where they worshiped, such as Holy Family Church on North 18th and Izard Streets.(n.d.) Holy Family Church City of Omaha Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission. - The church, built by Irish immigrants, is located at 915 North 18th Street. West Central-Cathedral Landmark Heritage District developed around the Academy of the Sacred Heart, opened in 1882, and St. Cecilia Cathedral. This primarily residential district, the heart of which lies along both sides of North 38th Street, is the northern portion of what is known as the Gold Coast.West Central-Cathedral Landmark Heritage District City of Omaha. The area of far North Omaha from Ames Avenue north was not commonly acknowledged as an incorporated part of the city until after World War II, when a housing boom filled in many communities throughout the area(1937) Omaha Plat Map North Omaha was the site of several federal housing projects, first built in the 1930s as no-cost or low-cost housing for working-class families, often of Eastern European descent. Because of job losses and population changes in the city, by the late 1960s the projects in North Omaha were inhabited almost entirely by poor and low-income African Americans. Because of problems with crime, maintenance and segregation, as well as changing ideas about housing, in the early 2000s, the city tore down these facilities, including the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects. They replaced them with other public housing schemes featuring mixed-income and uses, with more community amenities. =Racism in housing= After the 1919 Omaha Race Riot, landlords began enforcing race-restrictive covenants. Properties for rent and sale were restricted on the basis of race, with the primary intent of keeping North Omaha \\"black\\" and the rest of the city \\"white.\\" Redlining by banks in decisions about loans supported such restrictions and limited reinvestment in North Omaha.(1992) A Street of Dreams. Nebraska ETV Network (video) The federal government's effort to insure mortgage lending led to racial discrimination in awards of loans. Such restrictions were ruled illegal in 1940. Boyd and Taylor Streets and North 30th Street between Manderson and Bedford are reported to have developed in the 1920s. Harry Buford was a well-to-do member of North Omaha's African- American community with a large home built in 1929 at 1804 North 30th Street. According to one report, \\"The location of the family home on the west side of North 30th Street indicated the status of the Buford family in Omaha during a period of racial segregation.\\"\\"Reconnaissance Survey of Select Nebraska Communities\\" These types of differentiations according to socioeconomic and racial boundaries were prevalent throughout the North Omaha area, as in other communities across the country. In an effort to improve working class housing in North Omaha during the Depression, in the 1930s the Federal government built the Logan-Fontenelle projects, which housed up to 2100 people in 556 apartments. The development was similar to a project of public housing on the South Side of Omaha. Every street was landscaped with trees. The project was named after a leader of the Omaha nation. Originally the housing was intended to be temporary, for working people with families. It was a significant improvement over housing then available to them. With later losses of jobs in Omaha, more people who were unemployed lived in the projects. Logan Fontenelle became heavily segregated as well and suffered from a concentration of poor families with difficulties. Racial tension Omaha's African-American residents were spread throughout the small city from its founding through the 1900s. In 1891 a white mob lynched an African-American man named George Smith.Bristow, D. (2002) A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha. Caxton Press. However, in the first few decades of the new century, increasing numbers of immigrants and migrants, and competition for jobs and housing, prompted eruptions of racial violence. Many African Americans had first been recruited by the meatpacking industry as strikebreakers, which raised resentment against them by working class ethnic immigrants and their descendants. In 1919, after Red Summer, a time of racial riots in several major industrial cities, a mostly ethnic immigrant white mob from South Omaha terrorized the city's African-American population. They began by dragging Will Brown from his jail cell. He was beaten and lynched. After the mob was done with Brown's corpse, they attacked property and other African Americans in Omaha. Their efforts were thwarted, however, by the arrival of soldiers from Fort Omaha who created a boundary around African-American neighborhoods to protect them. The commander also stationed troops in South Omaha to prevent any more mobs from forming.A Street of Dreams Nebraska Public Television. Riots, including arson and significant property damage, skirmishes with local police, and a bombing in the mid- to late-20th century were demonstrations of other racial tensions. The area continues to be somewhat racially charged, as it remains largely composed of poor African-American constituents, and violent crime is still higher than in other areas of the city. However, it has not experienced any major race incidents since 1993. Historical architecture Early North Omaha buildings and homes were characterized by their modest purposes. An example of such simplicity is located in the four-square-style houses located at N 38th Street and Glenwood Avenue. Craftsman and Craftsman- style bungalows were also popular in more affluent areas.Mead and Hunt, Inc. (2003) Reconnaissance Survey of Selected Neighborhoods in Central Omaha. Prepared for the City of Omaha. According to one report, \\"many neighborhoods generally consist of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century vernacular and period revival style houses, commercial, educational, and religious resources, and concentrations of post-World War II housing and public housing.\\"Reconnaissance Survey of Selected Neighborhoods in Nebraska Due to its exceptionally diverse history, particularly in respect to the rest of Nebraska, North Omaha is home to numerous historical and modern landmarks, listed on the Registered Historic Places within its boundaries. Historical government =Historical transportation= An early horse-drawn coach ran from Florence to Saratoga into Omaha from the 1860s through 1890s. Around that time horse-drawn trolleys replaced these coaches, which were then replaced with electrical street cars. North Omaha was the location of at least four street car lines that ran along 16th, 20th, 24th and 30th Streets, north and south from downtown Omaha. There were several railroad tracks in North Omaha, including those along Sorenson Parkway and parallel to 24th Street.(1948) Checker Cab Directory. p. 56. Retrieved 8/4/07. The Webster Street Depot was located at 15th and Webster Streets, and the Florence Depot was on North 30th Street in Florence. From at least before 1926, Nebraska Highway 5 used to run down N. 20th Street, jogging east on Ohio Street, and then along 16th. By 1931 this was replaced by N. 30th Street, which was designated as US 73. In 1984 US 73 was replaced by US 75, which maintains its position along N. 30th Street today.Morrison, J. (2007). Council Bluffs/Omaha: Highway Chronology . Between 1978 and 1980 a new freeway was built from I-480 north to Lake St, called I-580. This status was revoked when the State of Nebraska refused to upgrade the roadway to Interstate specifications, and the roadway is currently called the North Omaha Freeway. =Historical military presence= In 1878 Fort Omaha became the Headquarters for the Department of the Platte, covering territory that stretched from the Missouri River into Montana and from Canada to Texas. It was a supply fort, rather than a defense fort, that provided assistance for the American Indian Wars, World War I, and World War II. Fort Omaha is best known for its role in the 1879 landmark trial of Ponca chief Standing Bear. Originally known as Omaha Barracks, the frame buildings of the post surrounded and faced a rectangular parade ground. On the level ground on the east side were the post headquarters, guardhouse, bakery, storehouses and sutlers store. Ten single-story barracks were constructed to accommodate an equal number of companies, ten being the number of companies which then comprised a regiment. Five of the barracks were on the north end of the parade ground and the other five on the south end.(n.d.) Omaha Military History The hospital was built northwest of the north barracks. Most of these buildings still stand at the intersections of 30th and Fort Streets. The Fort Omaha Balloon School was the first such military school in America, and was located in North Omaha. After the United States entered the war on April 6, 1917, operations increased to the extent that a sub-post was needed to accommodate men and the maneuvering balloons. \\"Florence Field,\\" about a mile north of the fort, consisting of , was acquired for this purpose.Reeves, R. (n.d.) Douglas County History University of Nebraska. The troops at Fort Omaha were responsible for restoring order to the city after the Omaha Race Riot of 1919. =Libraries= In 1921 the city opened the North Branch Church Library at 25th and Ames. The location has been moved twice since, and the library has been renamed the Charles B. Washington Branch.(n.d.) North Branch Library . Omaha Public Library. Political and Civil rights movements in North Omaha North Omaha ace of political activism, especially by the Jewish American and African- American communities. They worked together in labor organizing, succeeding with the Meatpacking Union in the 1930s and 1940s. Starting in the 1920s the community was home to both national and local organizations seeking equal rights for African Americans, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Urban League. The De Porres Club met there starting in the late 1940s. During the 1960s popular locations in North Omaha for community activists to gather included the Fair Deal Cafe on 24th Street and Goodwin's Spencer Street Barbershop at 3116 N. 24th Street, where young Ernie Chambers was a barber. The movement continues to be represented by Senator Chambers, and continues in the community today. Notable figures from North Omaha The young Malcolm X North Omaha has been the birthplace and home of many figures of national and local import. They include Malcolm X; Whitney Young, an important civil rights leader; the storied Nebraska State Senator Ernie Chambers, and author Tillie Olsen. Singer Wynonie Harris, saxophonist Preston Love and Buddy Miles all have called North Omaha home. Businesswoman Cathy Hughes is from North Omaha. The community has also had several sports stars, including baseball player Bob Gibson, football player Johnny Rodgers, actress Gabrielle Union, actor John Beasley, Houston Texans running back Ahman Green, and basketball player Bob Boozer.

I assume that only the signatures that include the word \\"fecit\\" are ones he decorated, other inscriptions simply indicating retailing. According to Pountney the enamel was fired at the Temple Pottery.W.J. Pountney, Old Bristol Potteries (J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd., Bristol 1920), pp. 115-16 (Internet Archive). He also worked on glass, as the directory listing for 1813 describe him as a \\"China and glass enameler and gilder, wholesale and retail\\".

Band history Working as solo artists in Boston, the two members of the band, John Dragonetti and Blake Hazard, were introduced through a mutual friend, Joe Klompus. Dragonetti and Hazard formed a romantic and musical partnership, then took their show to Europe. The relationship lasted for four years, but ended in the fall of 2004 when the pair moved to L.A. After the break-up, both Hazard and Dragonetti continued writing songs, and because Hazard still recorded her music in Dragonetti's home studio, the pair quickly discovered the songs they had written were about each other and their sadness in having broken up. They decided to work on a few songs together and eventually got back together, and married. The new songs were mastered for the couple as a wedding present, and those tracks eventually became their first album. Hazard has said of the relationship, \\"It‚Äôs hard, definitely hard. Luckily we are like-minded aesthetically and musically.\\" Declare a New State!, The Submarines' first album was released in 2006 on the Nettwerk label. Blake Hazard Blake Hazard is from Burlington, Vermont. Her full given name is Eleanor Blake Hazard, although she prefers her middle name and uses it as her first. She attended the Putney School in southern Vermont, southeast of her hometown. She is also a graduate of Harvard University and is the great- granddaughter of American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.Carraway, Kate. \\"Marriage Records: Coupledom in Indie Rock Has a Special Patina but Is Not Without Its Perils\\", L.A. Weekly, 2008-09-25 Blake released a solo album of her own titled \\"Little Airplane\\" (2002) just two years previous to her breakup with John on California's election night in 2004. \\"Little Airplane\\" was recorded by John in his studio and was released on Boston-based independent record label Kimchee Records. The album can still be obtained on Kimchee's website or through The Submarines web store. Blake is an avid runner and has run numerous marathons and races for many causes. These marathons have taken place in Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. John Dragonetti John attended the American School of Dubai. Originally from Jackson, Michigan, his family moved to Dubai when he was young. Upon arriving in Boston, he briefly attended college at the Berklee School of Music. To support himself, John worked as a bike messenger in the city of Boston and played in several Boston-area bands before going solo. Jack Drag was his moniker for music he recorded at his apartment home studio, which he called Space 67. Much of the recorded material was done on a 4-track cassette recorder. Several singles and a self-titled, full-length album, \\"The Red Record,\\" or \\"cataloged as Pop Spelled Backwards\\" (as dubbed by his friends and bandmates) were released. The first single, \\"Velour,\\" was released by Dave Gibbs (of the Gigolo Aunts), on his label called Sumerville Records. The second single was put out by John's record label, called Devil's Weed, Inc. A third single was released on Hepcat Records. As a result of these recordings, John was signed to A&M; Records. When A&M; was acquired by Universal Music, Jack Drag was dropped from the label and he continued recording independently in Space 67. Vowing to keep releasing his music, he rolled up his sleeves and released more albums with Shifty Disco, Scientific Records and Sugar Free Records. This eventually led to a project with his old friend Peter DuCharme (AKA: Master Cylinder) called the Junior Communist Club. Several tracks left over from the Jack Drag A&M; sessions were used for the project, and a few staple commercials resulted from the release. To this date, there have been no plans to release any new material by Jr. Communist Club. John has stated that \\"Although encouraged to, we never did put together a live show. I'm sure we'll collaborate again but whether it will be under the Jr.Commy moniker remains to be seen.\\" As for his moniker Jack Drag, he states on the Jack Drag web site, \\"It's all about The Submarines now!\\" Band Jason Stare and Scott Barber are part of the touring band. (As an inside joke, John has said that when the Subs play live with some computer tracks, the band is called The Robots). The Submarines have toured the United States and the world, sometimes as a duo, and sometimes as a full band. Many shows in the beginning, for the band's first tour, consisted of just Blake and John. For the band's second release, Honeysuckle Weeks, Jason joined to play drums for their live shows. Jason has been the band's live set drummer since the release of Honeysuckle Weeks, and is featured in Apple commercials for the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS. He is an artist, a college graduate and is from Long Island, New York. On bringing him on tour, John has stated, \\"I saw him live and I liked his playing. But seriously, just look at him. He looks cool!\\" For the first leg of the 2011 Love Notes/Letter Bombs tour, The Submarines brought on Scott Barber to play Bass for live performances. Jason and Scott also have a side project together.

One of the first three parks in the District was named for him: Tilden Regional Park. Tilden was born in the Sierra foothills town of Chile Gulch, Calaveras County on July 17, 1857 to Harmon J. Tilden and Mary Jane Lee. His father was a judge. The Tildens moved to San Francisco in 1865. Tilden graduated from Lowell High School in 1874 and from the University of California, Berkeley in 1878. He received his law degree from Hastings College of Law in 1881. While attending the University of California, he joined a campus unit which was eventually incorporated into the California National Guard. His affiliation with the National Guard continued through the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, in which he participated. He left the Guard with the rank of major and was often addressed as \\"Major Tilden\\" for the remainder of his life. Tilden married Lilly Mitchell (nee Von Schmidt; October 12, 1859 - November 8, 1946) on June 9, 1892. The Tildens resided in Alameda. Tilden Way at the southeast end of Alameda is named for him. The Tildens' son, Charles Lee Tilden, Jr. (June 4, 1894 - September 21, 1968) was a member of the United States Olympic rugby team in 1920 at Antwerp and 1924 at Paris, winning the gold medal in both Olympiads.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 591 and it contained 254 housing units. Hittle Township was originally called Union Township. The name was changed from Union to Waterford Township on May 20, 1850, and again from Waterford to Armington Township in August, 1850. Armington was changed to Hittle though on November 11 of that same year. The Township is named for pioneer settler George Hittle (1774-1842), one of the four sons of Revolutionary War soldier George Michael Hittle (1741-1828). The younger George Hittle had been born near Fishing Creek, Northumberland County (present-day Columbia County) Pennsylvania. He emigrated to Greene County, Ohio prior to 1812. He served in the War of 1812 from Ohio as Sergeant in Captain Zechariah Ferguson's militia company. In 1818, he made an exploratory trip into Illinois but determined not to move there due to unsettled conditions with Indians. In 1826 he returned with his wife, sons George and Adam Hittle and their families, as well as that of his friend John Wheatley Judy (1798-1860). The two families settled along Sugar Creek in Tazewell County in that year. George Hittle was elected one of the first 3 commissioners for Tazewell County. The settlement they founded near present-day Armington was called Hittle's Grove and was home to the extended Hittle and Judy families until 1926. George Hittle and John W. Judy and many of their descendants are buried at Hittle's Grove Cemetery which is located approximately 5 miles northwest of Armington.

The youngest of four girls, Aldis was educated privately, and attended the prestigious Miss Porter's School. The family spent summers on their farm near Wheaton, Illinois. When she was 17, Aldis attended Smith College for two years before returning to Chicago. Like her mother, who reported for the Sunday Tribune, Aldis began working for the paper, writing columns on decorating, pets, and personals. On June 15, 1922, she married Graham Aldis. The couple lived in Chicago and had four children: Mary, Owen, and twins Peggy and Ruth. Her first publications were books of poetry for children. In 1929, she began writing children's fiction. Unable to find time to write at home with her growing family, Aldis often took her typewriter to a local park to work. In this way, she wrote seven novels and three books of poetry during the 1930s. Several of her best-known poems were published in these early years, such as \\"Snow\\", \\"Little\\" and \\"Hiding\\". > I'm hiding, I'm hiding And no one knows where; For all they can see is my > Toes and my hair And I just heard my father Say to my mother - \\"But, > darling, he must be Somewhere or other; Have you looked in the inkwell?...\\" She also wrote short stories and poetry for Ladies Home Journal, Harper's and The New Yorker, among others.

A key patron of chivalric sagas. The riddaras√∂gur (literally 'sagas of knights', also known in English as 'chivalric sagas', 'romance-sagas', 'knights' sagas', 'sagas of chivalry') are Norse prose sagas of the romance genre. Starting in the thirteenth century with Norse translations of French chansons de geste and Latin romances and histories, the genre expanded in Iceland to indigenous creations in a similar style. While the riddaras√∂gur were widely read in Iceland for many centuries they have traditionally been regarded as popular literature inferior in artistic quality to the Icelanders' sagas and other indigenous genres. Receiving little attention from scholars of Old Norse literature, many remain untranslated. The production of chivalric sagas in Scandinavia was focused on Norway in the thirteenth century and then Iceland in the fourteenth. Vernacular Danish and Swedish romances came to prominence rather later and were generally in verse; the most famous of these are the Eufemiavisorna, themselves predominantly translations of Norwegian translations of Continental European romances. Terminology The term riddaras√∂gur (singular riddarasaga) occurs in M√°gus saga jarls where there is a reference to \\"Fr√°sagnir...svo sem...√ûi√∞reks saga, Fl√≥venz saga e√∞r a√∞rar riddaras√∂gur\\", \\"narratives such as the saga of √ûi√∞rekr, the saga of Fl√≥vent, or other knights' sagas\\". Another technical term sometimes encountered is lygis√∂gur (singular lygisaga), \\"lie sagas\\", applied to fictional chivalric and legendary sagas. Translations The first known Old Norse translations of European romances occurred under the patronage of king H√°kon H√°konarson of Norway, and seem to have been part of a programme of Europeanisation. The earliest dated work is a 1226 translation by one Brother Robert of Tristan by Thomas of Britain. The Old Norse work, Tristrams saga ok √çs√∂ndar, is especially valuable since the original Old French poem is only preserved in fragments. Elis saga ok R√≥samundu, a translation of Elie de Saint Gille, is similarly attributed to an Abbot Robert, presumably the same man having been promoted within his order. King H√°kon also commissioned M√∂ttuls saga, an adaptation of Le mantel mautaill√©, √çvens saga, a reworking of Chr√©tien de Troyes's Yvain and Strengleikar, a collection of ballads principally by Marie de France. Works in similar style, which may also have been commissioned by King H√°kon, are Parcevals saga, Valvens √æ√°ttr and Erex saga, all derived from the works of Chr√©tien de Troyes. Karlamagn√∫s saga is a compilation of more disparate origin, dealing with Charlemagne and his twelve paladins and drawing on historiographical material as well as chansons de geste. Other works believed to derive from French originals are Bevers saga, Fl√≥res saga ok Blankifl√∫r, Fl√≥vents saga and Partalopa saga. Pseudo-historical works translated from Latin are Alexanders saga (a translation of Alexandreis), Am√≠cus saga ok Amil√≠us (based on Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum historiale), Breta s√∂gur (a translation of Historia Regum Britanniae), and Tr√≥jumanna saga (a translation of De excidio Troiae). Also pseudo-historical, √ûi√∞reks saga af Bern is unusual in having been translated from German. These Old Norse translations have been characterised by Margaret Clunies Ross thus: :The Old Norse term riddarasaga ... covers what were a number of genres in Latin, French and Anglo-Norman, but common to all of them are their courtly setting, their interest in kingship, and their concerns with the ethics of chivalry and courtly love. It seems, however, from a comparison between the French originals and the Old Norse translations of courtly romances, such as Chr√©tien de Troyes' Erec et Enide (Erex saga), Yvain (√çvens saga) and Perceval (Parcevals saga and Velvens √æ√°ttr), that the translators who supplied King H√°kon's court and others in Norway and Iceland who enjoyed such sagas offered an independent rewriting of their sources. It is notable that they did not convey a number of key aspects of Chr√©tien's somewhat ironic perspective on courtly society. This may well be because most of the translators were probably clerics, but it is also likely to reflect traditional Norse tastes and narrative conventions. In particular, most elements of explicit eroticism have been deleted from the riddaras√∂gur, as have much comedy and irony in the treatment of the protagonists' behaviour. Instead, the narratives are largely exemplary and didactic, in large part because the Scandinavian translators refrained from using two essential narrative devices of their sources, namely the internal monologue, which conveyed the private thoughts and feelings of the characters, and the intrusive involvement of the narrator, which was a vehicle for conveying a nuanced and often ironic point of view.Margaret Clunies Ross, The Cambridge Introduction to the Old Norse-Icelandic Saga (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 81. Original compositions Inspired by translated Continental romances, Icelanders began enthusiastically composing their own romance-sagas, apparently around the later thirteenth century, with the genre flourishing from the fourteenth century. The rise of the genre has been associated with Iceland coming under Norwegian rule in the 1260s, and the consequent need for Icelandic ecclesiastical and secular elites to explore Icelanders' new identities as vassals to a king. These new political formations particularly affected the marriage market for elite Icelanders, making gender politics a central theme of many romances.J√≥hanna Katr√≠n Fri√∞riksd√≥ttir, Women in Old Norse Literature: Bodies, Words, and Power (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), esp. pp. 5, 116. One seminal composition, directly or indirectly influential on many subsequent sagas, seems to have been Kl√°ri saga, whose prologue states that it was translated from a Latin metrical work which J√≥n Halld√≥rsson Bishop of Sk√°lholt found in France, but which is now thought to have been composed by J√≥n from scratch.; cf. Marianne Kalinke, 'Cl√°ri saga: A Case of Low German Infiltration', Scripta Islandica: Isl√§ndska s√§llskapets √§rbok, 59 (2008), pp. 5-25. J√≥n's work seems to have been one of the inspirations for the fourteenth-century North Icelandic Benedictine School which, while most clearly associated with religious writing, also seems to have involved romance-writing. Post-medieval reception Chivalric sagas remained in widespread manuscript circulation in Iceland into the twentieth century. They were often reworked as r√≠mur, and new chivalric sagas in the same mould as medieval ones continued to be composed into the nineteenth century. Particularly during the eighteenth century, some chivalric sagas were taken to be useful historical sources for the history of Sweden and Denmark, underpinning their imperial aspirations, and were printed in these countries. One prominent example is Erik Julius Bi√∂rner's Nordiska k√§mpa dater of 1737.Erik Julius Bi√∂rner, Nordiska k√§mpa dater: I en sagoflock samlade om forna kongar och hj√§ltar.

Accessit praeter conspectum genealogicum Suethicorum regum et reginarum accuratissimum etiam praefatio &c.; (Stockholm: Typis Joh. L.

The text is either a translation of a lost Low German prose narrative of Theoderic's life, or a compilation by a Norwegian or Icelandic scholar based on German material. It is a pre-eminent source for a wide range of medieval Germanic legends. Titles The name Vilkinasaga was first used in Johan Peringski√∂ld's Swedish translation of 1715. Peringski√∂ld named it after Vilkinaland, which the saga says was an old name for Sweden and G√∂taland.wilcina land som nw √§r kalladh swerige oc g√∂taland. Origins The saga contains many narratives found in other medieval tales about Theoderic, but also supplements them with other narratives and provides many additional details. It is not clear how much of the source material might have been orally transmitted and how much the author may have had access to written poems.Davidson, Andrew R., 'The Legends of √ûi√∞reks saga af Bern' (Unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1995). The preface of the text itself says that it was written according to \\"tales of German men\\" and \\"old German poetry\\", possibly transmitted by Hanseatic merchants in Bergen.The article Didrik av Bern in Nationalencyklopedin (1990). Contrary to the historical reality of Theoderic's life, most of the action of the saga is set in Northern Germany, situating Attila's capital at Susat (Soest in Westphalia) and the battle situated in the medieval German poem Rabenschlacht in Ravenna taking place at the mouth of the Rhine. This is part of a process operative in oral traditions called \\"localization\\", connecting events transmitted orally to familiar places, and is one of the reasons that the poems collected by the saga-writer are believed to be Low German in origin. The prevailing interpretation of an Italian saga milieu was largely questioned by the German philologist Heinz Ritter- Schaumburg, who claims the texts to be based on a historiographical vita of an Eastern Frankish Dietrich with his seat rather in Verona cisalpina (Bonn on the Rhine).Heinz Ritter-Schaumburg, Dietrich von Bern. K√∂nig zu Bonn. Munich‚ÄìBerlin 1982. Ritter-Schaumburg's theory has been rejected by scholars working in the field.See the following negative reviews: ; ; Here 125-128. Contents Heroes from the story of Theoderic, after a wall-painting in Floda church in S√∂dermanland. At the centre of √ûi√∞reks saga is a complete life of King √ûi√∞rekr of Bern. It begins by telling of √ûi√∞rekr's grandfather and father, and then tells of √ûi√∞rekr's youth at his father's court, where Hildebrand tutors him and he accomplishes his first heroic deeds. After his father's death, √ûi√∞rekr leads several military campaigns: then he is exiled from his kingdom by his uncle Ermenrik, fleeing to Attila's court. There is an unsuccessful attempt to return to his kingdom, during which Attila's sons and √ûi√∞rekr's brother die. This is followed by √ûi√∞rekr's entanglement in the downfall of the Niflings, after which √ûi√∞rekr successfully returns to Verona and recovers his kingdom. Much later, after the death of both Hildebrand and his wife Herrad, √ûi√∞rekr kills a dragon who had killed King Hernit of Bergara, marrying the widow and becoming king of Bergara. After Attila's death, √ûi√∞rekr becomes king of the Huns as well. The final time he fights an opponent is to avenge the death of Heime (who had become a monk and then sworn loyalty to √ûi√∞rekr once again). After this, he spends all his time hunting. One day, upon seeing a particularly magnificent deer, he jumped out of the bathtub and mounts a gigantic black horse ‚Äì this is the devil. It rides away with him, and no one knows what happened to him after that, but the Germans believe that he received God and Mary's grace and was saved. In addition to the life of √ûi√∞rekr, various other heroes' lives are recounted as well in various parts of the story, including Attila, Wayland the Smith (in the section called Velents √æ√°ttr smi√∞s), Sigurd, the Nibelungen, and Walter of Aquitaine. The section recounting √ûi√∞rekr's avenging of Hertnit seems to have resulted from a confusion between √ûi√∞rekr and the similarly named Wolfdietrich.

Adaptations and influence Erich von Richthofen in his studies of the Castilian Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara has pointed to numerous analogies with the epic of central and northern Europe, in particular stating that in addition to many original Castilian elements and motifs, the epic of the Lara princes has many in common with the √ûi√∞reks saga. √ûi√∞reks saga was the basis for the Swedish Didrikssagan, a translation from the mid-fifteenth century which survives in one, largely complete, manuscript, Skokloster 115/116.The Saga of Didrik of Bern with the Dwarf King Laurin, trans. by Ian Cumpstey (Cumbria: Skadi Press, 2017), p. 295. The Swedish reworking of the story is rather independent: many repetitions were avoided and the material is structured in a more accessible manner. The Swedish version is believed to have been composed on the orders of king Karl Knutsson, who was interested in literature.The article Didrikssagan in Nordisk familjebok (1907). √ûi√∞reks saga had considerable influence on Swedish historiography as the saga identified the country of Vilkinaland with Sweden and so its line of kings was added to the Swedish line of kings. In spite of the fact that the early scholar Olaus Petri was critical, these kings were considered to have been historic Swedish kings until fairly recent times. The historicity of the kings of Vilkinaland was further boosted in 1634 when Johannes Bureus discovered the Norwegian parchment that had arrived in Sweden in the 15th century.

Chalker, and completes the Wars of the Well World duology begun with Exiles at the Well of Souls. A foreword by Chalker indicates that Quest and Exiles were originally conceived as a single book, but due to the decision to split them, Quest was written to be readable as a standalone novel. Plot summary In Exiles at the Well of Souls, Mavra Chang was captured by the Olborn, who use magical stones to convert beings into beasts of burden. The Olborn were interrupted partway through transforming Chang, leaving her partially transformed. Eleven years later, Chang remains an involuntary guest in the native hex of the human equivalents on the Well, Glathriel. After multiple attempts to escape, she has been reconditioned to accept her existence, and a maimed Glathrielite, Joshi, has undergone a similar partial transformation in Olborn to serve as a companion for Mavra. Inspired by the Diviner and the Rel, the Northern being that crossed from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere in Midnight at the Well of Souls, several competing factions have discovered that the Northern beings inhabiting the hex of Yugash can \\"possess\\" a Southerner and allow him to pass into Yugash. In Exiles at the Well of Souls, two ships were crash-landed on the Well World. The first landed in the South, and was destroyed at the end of the war in Exiles. The second landed in the north, and now the factions that fought the war in Exiles are girding for a race to the second ship. Several other players who participated in the drama in Exiles are also introduced. Antor Trelig was a politician as well as the head of the sponge syndicate, in control of a significant fraction of the council governing human space. He was transformed at the Well World into a Makiem, a giant frog-like creature. Renard was the librarian on Trelig's resort planetoid of New Pompeii, which was subsequently transformed into the home of Obie, the supercomputer capable of using Markovian physics to manipulate the universe. Renard was transformed into an Agitar, a blue-colored satyr who rides winged horses. Ben Yulin was the assistant to Dr. Gilgram Zinder, Obie's designer, as well as an agent for Trellig. Yulin was transformed into a Dasheen, a minotaur. After a showdown between Mavra's party and Yulin's party, the remnants agree to a truce with Yulin and return in the ship to Obie. In addition to Mavra and Yulin, the other members of the party are Renard, a Yugash, a Bozog (another northern species, they moved the ship from the non-tech hex it landed in to their own high-tech hex), a Lata (a southern species resembling a pixie) named Vistaru (previously Vardia Diplo), and a Yaxa (a southern species resembling a giant butterfly) named Wooley (previously Wu Julee and Kally Tonge). Once they arrive, Ben Yulin attempts to take over Obie, but the computer assists Mavra and the others in destroying the circuit that forces Obie to obey Yulin. Obie returns to human space, and when a Council fleet arrives to destroy him, he fakes his own destruction and departs with Mavra to explore the rest of the universe as partners.

A G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor located on the external cell plasma membrane, it is coupled to GŒ±s and upregulates levels of cAMP by activating adenylyl cyclase. The ACTH receptor plays a role in immune function and glucose metabolism.  Structure  ACTH receptors are the shortest of the melanocortin receptor family and are the smallest known G-coupled receptors. Both human and bovine ACTH receptors are synthesized as 297 residue long proteins with 81% sequence homology. There are currently no available protein X-ray crystallography structures for the ACTH receptor available in the Protein Data Bank; while the ACTH receptor and the Œ≤2 adrenergic receptor are relatively distantly-related with a sequence identity of approximately 26%, MC2R investigators such as David Fridmanis have assumed that the folded surfaces of both receptors that are responsible for binding GŒ±s should be very similar and use conserved motifs. The full length sequence of MC2R includes seven hydrophobic domains that are predicted as transmembrane segments. In the third intracellular loop of the receptor a protein kinase A and protein kinase c phosphorylation motifs have been detected. ACTH receptors also require the binding of melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein-1 (MRAP1) without which ACTH receptors cannot bind ACTH. Without MRAP, the receptor is degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum, but with MRAP, the receptor is glycosylated and expressed on the cell plasma membrane.  Ligands  MCR's have both endogenous agonists and antagonists. =Agonists= Œ±-MSH and ACTH are both peptides derived from processed POMC, and both activate the other MCR's, but ACTH is the only agonist ligand for MC2R (ACTH receptor). This suggests that there is more protein-related specificity for binding MC2R. =Antagonists= Agouti-related protein and Agouti-signaling protein are antagonist peptides to MC2R.  Tissue and subcellular localization  ACTH receptor is primarily found in the zona fasciculata of the human adrenal cortex. Binding of the receptor by ACTH stimulates the production of glucocorticoids (GCs). (By contrast, aldosterone production from the zona glomerulosa is stimulated primarily by angiotensin II.) ACTH receptors are also expressed in the skin, and in both white and brown adipoctyes, and is expressed in greater concentrations when adipose cells differentiate. It is well known that levels of corticosterone (CORT, cortisol in humans) secretion demonstrate a circadian rhythm, highly regulated by effects of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, with higher levels in the early evening and lower levels in the morning. ACTH levels, ACTH receptor expression, and MRAP1 expression also demonstrate circadian rhythm, with ACTH secretion and MRAP expression highest in the evening, suggesting that MRAP expression is responsible for CORT secretory regulation. However, with exposure to constant light, the rhythmic expression of the ACTH receptor and MRAP genes reversed, suggesting ACTH-independent signalling pathways for MRAP and ACTH receptor transcription and expression. Clinical significance The ACTH receptor plays a role in glucose metabolism when expressed in white adipose cells. When bound to ACTH, a short-term insulin-resistance occurs, and it stimulates lipolysis via hormone sensitive lipase. Demonstrated in mice, ACTH promotes lipolysis in response to increased energy demand, notably in times of stress. Lipolytic activity due to melanocortin receptors has been demonstrated in several types of test animals: rats and hamsters primarily respond to ACTH, rabbits respond to alpha and beta MSH's (therefore not using the ACTH receptor), and guinea pigs responding to both ACTH and other MSH's. In humans, ACTH has little lipolytic effect on adipose tissue. ACTH receptor activation also influences immune function. Melanocortins, including ACTH, have anti- inflammatory effects which can be exerted via GC-dependent and -independent pathways. The GC-dependent pathway activates ACTH receptors to increase levels of cortisol which bind GC receptors. Via genomic and faster non-genomic pathways, this causes, among other immune responses, a reduction in leukocyte and neutrophil infiltration, cytokine production, especially of cytokine CXCL-1, and increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. These profound anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to increase GC's are why ACTH therapy is still used today. It is often used as treatment for infantile spasms, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, gout, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. This is problematic long-term and can lead to ACTH-receptor pathway-related side effects including: Cushing's syndrome, fluid retention, glaucoma, and cardiovascular disorders. Mutations in this receptor cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) type 1, in which patients have high levels of serum ACTH and low levels of cortisol. Mutation of the receptor gene causes 25% of FGD, and mutation on the MRAP gene causes 20% of FGD. Mutations of ACTH can also contribute to this pathology: mutation of the \\"message sequence\\" inhibits cAMP production when bound to the ACTH receptor, and mutation of the \\"address sequence\\" inhibits binding to the receptor altogether.

History  Tapa Gaccha was founded by Acharya Jagatchandra Suri in Vikram Samvat 1285 (1228 AD). He was given the title of \\"Tapa\\" (i.e., the meditative one) by the ruler of Mewar. This title was applied to the group. Under Vijayanandsuri's leadership and other monks, Shwetambara Murtipujak Conference was established in 1893 which reformed mendicant as well as lay religious practices. As a result of this reform, most Shwetambara Jain monks today belong to Tapa Gaccha. Today, the majority of its followers live in states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Punjab and Rajasthan. =Denominations= Later Tapa Gachha is followed by 21 different samuday or orders. The sects follow different rituals but they do not have differences about scriptures. Some of these differences include Tithi (calendar date), veneration of gurus, pilgrimage of Palitana temples during monsoon and Santikaram (a religious text) chanting on Chaturdasi (14th day in each half of month in Jain calendar). Till the time of Nemisuri, there was a unity in Tapa Gachcha because of lack of proper knowledge about Tithi decision. Ramchandrasuri of Prem Suri follows his guru and corrected tithi decision which was followed by other three groups(Samudaay) of Jain Monks. 'Be Tithi Paksh' with the view that religious ritual Tithi can be omitted or held more than one time in the religious calendar. In 1935, on Samvatsari, the last day of Paryushan, Ramchandrasuri order observed it on a different day. This became a sectarian issue and tapa gachcha separated into new Be Tithi Paksh or 'two date fraction' and existing Ek Tithi Paksh or 'one date fraction'. Anandji Kalyanji Trust, which manages 1200 Jain temples, unsuccessfully attempted several times to resolve the issue. In 1986, Bhuvanbhanu suri order formally separated from Premsuri order and Ramchandra suri followed for two more years then stuck to Right decision of Tithi. Other distinguishing factors include veneration of gurus using Vasakshep (a sandalwood powder used for worship) between these two fractions. Be tithi fraction believe that Guru or Acharya should be venerated by Navangi Guru Poojan, spreading powder on nine points of body while Ek tithi fraction believe that it should be spread on one point of body, Akangi Guru Poojan. Both fractions differ on pilgrimage of Palitana temples on mount Shatrunjay by lay persons during monsoon.

J. Helmerich, as well as being a former member of the American band Nelson. Garsed was featured on Derek Sherinian's solo records Planet X (1999) and Planet X's Quantum (2007), and more recently Sherinian's Molecular Heinosity (2010).  Career  = Early life = Garsed was born in rural Victoria, Australia and began playing guitar at age 12 after hearing Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore play \\"Speed King\\". After about a month of initial lessons, he continued to teach himself and formed a band composed of his two cousins and a mutual friend and began playing live. = 1980s and 1990s = In July 1985, Garsed was featured in Guitar Player magazine‚Äôs \\"Spotlight\\" column, which was devoted to exposing new talent to the rest of the world. This encouraged Garsed to give up his job as a licensed plumber and pursue a career as a professional musician, prompting him to send demo tapes to as many record companies and management companies as he could find. \\"I wasn‚Äôt looking for a record deal. I just wanted to get into a good band.\\" One of the tapes was heard by Ross Fraser of the Wheatley Organization, which led to an audition for a short tour by Australian superstar John Farnham. Farnham, at this time still a member of the Little River Band, was planning a solo album and invited him to be a part of the project. The resulting album, Whispering Jack, went on to become the biggest selling album in Australian history, followed by sellout tours of Australia and Europe. Garsed continued to tour and record with Farnham until early 1989, when he was invited to the US to audition for Nelson, a band led by Gunnar and Matthew, sons of the late Ricky Nelson. The audition was a success and the resulting album, After the Rain, went on to sell in excess of three million copies and yielded a national No. 1 ('Love and Affection') as well as two Top Ten follow-up singles. In early 1990, Garsed also recorded Centrifugal Funk for Mike Varney's label Legato Records, an intense guitar album featuring Frank Gambale and Shawn Lane. For most of 1991 Garsed toured the US with Nelson, and spent ‚Äò92 recording Quid Pro Quo with Chicago-born guitarist T J Helmerich after the duo decided to sign to Varney‚Äôs label. With Nelson on a seemingly permanent hiatus, Garsed and TJ pursued their career promoting Quid Pro Quo, which featured Bobby Rock on drums, Gary Willis on bass and Paul Mirkovich on keys. Greeted with critical acclaim worldwide, the pair recorded the follow-up album Exempt in 1993. In 1996 Bobby Rock released Out Of Body, a progressive rock album featuring Garsed on guitar. In 1994 Garsed also filmed an instructional video for REH/Warner titled Rock Fusion which covers, in detail, his unique approach to guitar improvisation. Garsed‚Äôs most recent recording projects include the Uncle Moe‚Äôs Space Ranch album featuring TJ Helmerich, Gary Willis, Dennis Chambers and Scott Kinsey, the Tapestry album which was released under the band name Mojo and features Ric Fierabracci on bass and Kofi Baker, son of Ginger Baker on drums, and more recently his debut solo album Big Sky with Fierabracci returning for bass and production duties and Toss Panos behind the drums. = 2000s = Garsed returned to Australia after 14 years in Los Angeles and completed the seven-month-long \\"Last Time\\" tour with John Farnham. His first solo album, Big Sky, was released in 2002. After nearly a decade, he followed this up with Dark Matter in 2011. In 2004, Rock Guitar Improvisation, his second instructional DVD was released covering many aspects of his technique. This DVD also included some live footage. In 2007, Garsed toured with Paul Stanley on his Live to Win tour. Garsed played rhythm guitar and provided backing vocals.http://www.brettgarsed.com/news/news.php In 2011, Garsed took part in the John Farnham \\"Whispering Jack - 25th Anniversary\\" tour around Australia, revisiting the parts he created on Australia's highest selling locally made album. Garsed also released his solo album Dark Matter in 2011.  Influences and style  Garsed is mainly an improviser guitarist, renowned for his legato and hybrid picking technique, a combination that provides him with an extremely fluid sound to his playing. He has also mastered a distinctive slide guitar sound, specially noticeable in his latest releases. Rather than relying on scale patterns and figures, he plays with a relative pitch approach, which allows him to play the melodies in his mind. A fundamental component of his music is the use of wide intervals and chromatic passing tones. His early influences were Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour and Jimi Hendrix. This later expanded to more diverse styles such as Leo Kottke, Allan Holdsworth, Rory Gallagher, Scott Henderson, and Edward Van Halen.

She was educated at Smith College, Barnard College and Columbia University, where she studied under Meyer Schapiro. She also studied at New York University Institute of Fine Arts with Walter W.S. Cook. Through cinematographer Michael Chapman, Rose was introduced to many New York artists, including Carl Andre and Frank Stella. In 1961, Rose received a Fulbright to Spain. Stella joined her in Europe and the two were married in 1961 in London. They divorced in 1969. With the encouragement of Michael Fried Rose began writing art criticism, which, in 1963, led to a monthly \\"New York Letter\\" in the journal Art International. ABC Art In October 1965, Rose published the essay \\"ABC Art\\" in Art in America magazine, in which she described the fundamental characteristics of minimal art. In her essay, Rose considered the diverse roots of minimalism in the work of Kasimir Malevich and Marcel Duchamp as well as the choreography of Merce Cunningham, the art criticism of Greenberg, the philosophy of Wittgenstein and the novels of Robbe-Grillet. In examining the historical roots of minimal art in 1960s America, Rose drew a distinction between Malevich's \\"search for the transcendental, universal, absolute\\" and Duchamp's \\"blanket denial of the existence of absolute values.\\" Rose grouped some 1960s artists as closer to Malevich, some as closer to Duchamp, and some as between the two. Closer to Malevich were Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Robert Huot, Lyman Kipp, Richard Tuttle, Jan Evans, Ronald Bladen, Anne Truitt. Closer to Duchamp were Richard Artschwager and Andy Warhol. Between Malevich and Duchamp she placed Robert Morris, Donald Judd, Carl Andre, and Dan Flavin. Her conclusion was that minimal art is both transcendental and negative: > \\"The art I have been talking about is obviously a negative art of denial and > renunciation. Such protracted asceticism is normally the activity of > contemplatives or mystics...Like the mystic, in their work these artists > deny the ego and the individual personality, seeking to evoke, it would > seem, the semihypnotic state of blank unconsciousness.\\" She also contrasted minimal art with Pop Art: > \\"...if Pop Art is the reflection of our environment, perhaps the art I have > been describing is its antidote, even if it is a hard one to swallow.\\" Career From 1962 until 1965, Rose was a New York correspondent for Art International; a contributing editor at Art in America from 1965 through 1971; at Vogue from 1966 until 1988; and at Artforum from 1965 until 1973. From 1970 until 1971, Rose served as the first director of the museum at the University of California, Irvine. In 1975 Rose gave art instruction at the New York City correctional facility. She was also an art critic for New York magazine from 1971 until 1977, art editor at the Partisan Review from 1975 until 1996, associate editor at Arts magazine from 1978 until 1988, and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Art from 1988 through 1991. Rose served as a consultant to Cond√© Nast from 1970 until 1987 and to the GSA Art in Architecture program from 1990 to 1992. From 1981 until 1985, Rose held the position of senior curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where she curated shows, including \\"Mir√≥ in America\\" and \\"Fernand L√©ger and the Modern Spirit: An Avant-Garde Alternative to Non-Objective Art,\\" both in 1982. In 1983, Rose curated the first-ever Lee Krasner retrospective. The College Art Association of America awarded Rose the Distinguished Art Criticism Award in 1966 and 1969. Rose was the senior curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, from 1981 and 1985 and the founding director of the Katzen Arts Center at American University. In 2010, Rose was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the Spanish government for her contributions to art history and Spanish culture. Rose's books include American Art Since 1900 (1967), The Golden Age of Dutch Painting (1969), Lee Krasner (1983), and Autocritique: Essays on Art and Anti-Art (1989). She has also published countless catalogue essays, produced eight films, and curated museum exhibitions. Rose is also credited with popularizing the term Neo-Dada.

It was a part of the CIA's effort to portray the administration of Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz as having ties to the Soviet Union, prior to the CIA sponsored 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat which overthrew √Årbenz later the same year. On 19 February, 1954, the CIA, working through the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua, planted a cache of Soviet-made arms on the Nicaraguan coast near the fishing village of Masachapa to be \\"discovered\\" weeks later by Rafael Lola, a lieutenant in the Nicaraguan army, and fishermen in the pay of Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. The CIA also wished to dispose of the weapons, which were to have been used by Carlos Castillo Armas, and were therefore incriminating to the CIA. On May 7, 1954, President Somoza told reporters at a press conference that a Soviet submarine had been photographed, but that no prints or negatives were available. The story presented to the press was embroidered with the involvement of Guatemalan assassination squads. Somoza was supposed to convince the public that the arms had been intended for Guatemala. The press and the public were skeptical and the story did not get much press. However, the story became part of the Nicaragua local legends until the 1979 revolution. The operation received attention again during the attempts by the U.S. government to exploit the products of Operation PBHistory, the CIA effort to gather intelligence from documents left in Guatemala after the 1954 coup by the government and the communist party. Anti- Communist members of the US Congress, especially Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, began to use PBHistory documents in their reports, provided by the CIA to forestall the possibility that members of Congress, officially ignorant of the CIA's role in the Guatemalan coup, would expose other CIA projects. A subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report also claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation WASHTUB.

It is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford. The academy is owned and operated by the Benedictine monks of Marmion Abbey on campus. The academy is known for its three pillars: Spirituality, Academics and Leadership. The unique leadership formation programs include: Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program and a United States Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program that has been a part of the academy since its early years, but was not a part of the school in the inaugural year of 1933‚Äì34. The school is a part of the Chicago Catholic League. History The Marmion Academy was created in 1933 when the monks of St. Meinrad Abbey combined Jasper Academy (Jasper, Indiana) with the Fox Valley Catholic High School, which the Augustinians had just returned to the diocese of Rockford. During the Great Depression era it was difficult for students to pay their tuition as well as uniforms, so the monks, in 1935, associated with the JROTC program and changed its name to Marmion Military Academy. At the time, all JROTC uniforms were provided for by the US government. In the 1990s in order to provide more options for its student body and a return to the original spirit of the school, the monks of Marmion Abbey decided to make JROTC an optional program and to reinstitute the original name of the school, Marmion Academy. At one point, there were two campuses: one for residential students and one for day students. The two merged back into the Butterfield Road campus, which had been the residential campus. In early 2002, the school decided to close its residential program and started to expand its student body. In sports, the Cadets have been successful. In 2000, the Marmion swim team captured the school's first state championship, along with a 3rd place in 1998, 2nd in 1999, and 3rd in 2001. Later that decade, the 2010 Marmion Cadets placed 2nd in the state in the 6A State Championship for football and 3rd in the Cross Country Class 2A State Championships. In 2017, the Marmion Cadets baseball team finished 3rd in the 3A State Finals. Just a year later, the Cadets captured their 2nd state championship in school history as the track and field team won the 2018 Class 2A State Championship. Academics Graduation Requirements: Marmion requires that each graduate complete 4 credits each in English and Theology; 3 credits in Mathematics; 3 elective credits; 2 credits each in a Foreign Language (4 credits recommended), Science, Social Studies, and either Military Science (JROTC) or Leadership Education and Development (LEAD); and 1 credit each in Health/Physical Education; and ¬Ω credit in Music and Art. Marmion students are required to perform at least 15 hours of community service each academic year. At least 23¬º credits are required for graduation. Leadership Programs Marmion has two leadership programs, LEAD (Leadership Education and Development) and JROTC (Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps). The LEAD program was started in 1994, while the JROTC has been a part of the school since 1935.

It stretches across an area between the west of Bosaso, Somalia, to northwest of Erigavo, Somaliland. Its peak sits at almost in Shimbiris, northwest of Erigavo. Cal Madow was a tourist destination in the late 1980s. The local population of the Sanaag region is primarily responsible for preserving the habitat, which continues to face the risk of deforestation. Ecology camel peering over the leafier portions of Cal Madow The dense mountain forest sits at an altitude of between above sea level, and has a mean annual rainfall of . In addition to rainfall, Cal Madow receives additional precipitation in the form of fog and winter rains, which sustain isolated forests of juniperus, buxus and others. Mist also appears to be important in the distribution of juniperus (dayib), one of the species locals use for timber. For timber production, the buxus (dhoqos), buxus and celtis (boodaar) poles are cut from living trees in the evergreen forest. The discovery of the locust bean (ceratonia), lavenders and many other plant species has emphasized the many links the Cal Madow highlands have with the Mediterranean region. The Lamadaya waterfalls has one of the best-known sceneries in Cal Madow. Despite the current changes in land use, Cal Madow has internationally valuable unexploited mineral deposits and unique natural habitats. It is considered a key area for oil exploration, and has a petroleum system identical to, and formerly contiguous with, those within the Republic of Yemen. Florally, Cal Madow has approximately 1,000 plant species, 200 of which are only found on this mountain range. The flora of Somalila, much of which constitutes unique genetic resources, contains more than 3000 species of vascular plants, and is thus much richer than that of the Sahel region in general. Of the 156 plant families observed in Somalia, about 21% are restricted to the northern part of the country, while 11% are found in the south. Somalia houses a greater number of endemic plant species, many of which grow in the northern and eastern regions, notably in Cal Madow. Most of these species are herbs not found anywhere else in the world. Cal Madow and adjacent areas also have richer fauna than many other parts of Horn of Africa, and harbor some of the rarest and most localized of Somali endemic animal species. Here, Warsangli linnet (Carduelis johannis), pigeons (acanthus olivae) and golden-winged grosbeaks can be observed, as can antelopes such as the beira (dorcatragus megalotis), and different subspecies of gazelles. =Botanical survey= The unique flora of Cal Madow In January 1995, a team of botanists led by Dr. Mats Thulin of Uppsala University in Sweden visited the Cal Madow range on behalf of the Flora Somalia Project based in Uppsala. The study they conducted under the guidance of Somali Prof. Ahmed Warfa (Department of Botany and Range, Somali National University) constituted the most extensive botanical survey ever done in the area, with about eight new species of plant discovered in the process. Furthermore, the area houses an important germplasm, which requires protection from overexploitation and destruction by humans. On the basis of the recent botanical survey in Cal Madow, the team recommended that the local forest should be conserved as a national monument, as it plays an important role in the mountain range's ecosystem and represents a valuable natural resource. In addition, the forests offer unique opportunities for education and research. The agricultural benefit of clearing the forests, on the other hand, are negligible. The development of a wildlife reserve in these areas is under way and implemented by ECOTERRA Intl. together with the Calmadow Trust. International support should encourage the development of a study center, which would increase awareness of the value of the forest and provide long- term employment benefits. Some of the degraded forest areas could thereby be brought to a more natural state, while other areas would be developed for timber, fuelwood and honey production. Improved in the efficiency of the present farming, education and medical facilities are also crucial to the success of the proposed wildlife reserve. =Threats= Cal Madow's environment has suffered greatly in recent years along with its ecology, much of which is unique to it. Only a fraction of the flora remains, and its distribution remains sparse and unprotected. Although local knowledge of natural resources endemic to the area is great, agricultural and social projects as well as United Nations and foreign-aided development schemes usually failed to consider or make use of this insight. However since 1989, in the core zone of the Juniperus procera mountainous forest, ECOTERRA Intl, based on a request of the late Sultan of the Warsangeli clan, Suldan Abdisallam, renewed by his successor, Suldan Said, maintains a low key environmental awareness and nature protection programme through local groups. In addition, the growing of drought-resistant Rye and permaculture have been introduced to the local farmers by the organization. Detailed further conservation studies of the Cal Madow mountain range are needed to ascertain the present status of these areas, and to provide guidelines for and highlight the benefits of sustainable agricultural practices in the face of scarce forest resources. With a lack of proper utilization and conservation, the local plant life is threatened and therefore so is the wildlife which depends on it. The numerous plants indigenous to Cal Madow ensure that a proper study and assessment would yield benefits both to the region's human inhabitants and medical science in general.

The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1870. Description The Hainan hare is small; its body length is less than and weighs only . Its head is small and round. It has long ears that are longer than its hind feet. The upper part of the tail is black, while the under parts are white. It has a more colorful coat than most other hares: its back is brownish black and white, its belly is white, the fur on the flank is a mixture of brownish yellow and brownish white, and its limbs are dark brown. Behavior The Hainan hare is a solitary animal and active at night or dusk. It does not live in burrows, but hides in bushes. It likes to live in flat, cool land with many bushes. Habitat and distribution The Hainan hare is found in the dry grassland of western Hainan Island. It does not live in mountains or agricultural land. Threats In previous years, the Hainan hare was slaughtered for skin, and this continues to some degree. It is also threatened by loss of habitat. Most of the habitat and animals on Hainan are threatened by similar factors, like the Hainan black crested gibbon, one of the world's rarest primates.

The seven companies were mostly raised in Washington County. Jacob C. Higgins was selected to serve as colonel, A. J. Greenfield as lieutenant colonel, and George T. Work, Elias S. Troxell, and Henry A. Myers as majors. The 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry was sent to Maryland for training, after which it was assigned to the Department of West Virginia. The dismounted men were assigned to the Reserve Division, while the mounted portion of the unit became part of the 2nd Brigade, First Cavalry Division. It fought in several skirmishes during the Lynchburg Campaign and Early's Raid on Washington. In August, it was assigned to the Army of the Shenandoah as part of the 3rd Brigade, Cavalry Corps. It fought in several battles of Sheridan's campaign, such as at the Battle of Opequon and the Battle of Cedar Creek. In December, it was sent back to the Department of West Virginia, where it spent the remainder of the war chasing down guerrillas.

Development At a first glance the Socimi Type 821-SMG appears to be an outright Italian copy of the Israeli Uzi, although the design sports many differences and improvements over the original project. The firm of SOCIMI had been active in the railway building sector since the early 1970s; in 1983, it entered in a joint venture with the historic firearms manufacturer Luigi Franchi S.p.A. (which later, specifically in 1987, would have outright taken over) to concentrate on the military weapons business. The results of this collaboration were a series of assault rifles, and the Type 821-SMG. The early prototypes and evaluation samples of this sub-machinegun were shortly manufactured directly by Franchi, until SOCIMI had completed tooling-up to start in-house production. =Description= The Israeli UZI sub-machinegun was taken as a basis, and several technical solutions of such weapon were outright adopted, including the telescoping bolt (already in use in another Italian sub-machinegun, the Beretta PM-12), the safety/fire selector switch and the grip safety, and housing of the magazine in the pistol grip. However, SOCIMI/Franchi engineers wanted to distinguish their weapon from the original UZI, by developing a wide array of newer features. The SOCIMI sub-machinegun was built around a solid, monolithic rectangular receiver made out of one single piece of lightweight alloy, departing from the UZI's heavy stamped steel receiver design; the SOCIMI receiver has one single opening on the rear from which the entire bolt assembly can be extracted, while the barrel is inserted in the front and secured by a nut, and can be separated from the receiver by unscrewing it like in the UZI. The grip has finger grooves for better handling. The stock is tubular and sidefolding, departing from the complicated retractable design of the Israeli UZI; it pivots underneath the back side of the receiver and lies flat against the right side of the gun when folded. It is longer than the UZI stock (200 millimetres vs. 180), and results more comfortable to operate and to shoulder. The buttpad folds horizontally against the stock when not in use. While the original UZI collapsing stock could be useful as a blunt object/weapon in the event of extremely close engagements or hand-to-hand combat , the SOCIMI Type 821-SMG stock was not designed with such use in mind. The SOCIMI Type 821-SMG is overall lighter and more compact than the Israeli UZI, weighing 2.450 grams unloaded vs. 3.500 grams of the UZI unloaded; and has an overall length of 400 millimetres with stock folded (vs. 470 millimetres) and 600 millimetres with stock unfolded (same as the UZI). The overall length reduction was achieved by shortening the barrel, using a 200 millimetres length vs. the original 260 millimetres. This has helped to achieve a slower rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute vs. the original 600 rpm of the UZI. Controllability in full-automatic fire results dramatically enhanced. Optimum results are obtained within a range of 150‚Äì200 metres, the telescopic bolt balances the weapon such that it can be fired one- handed with complete control. =Users= The SOCIMI Type 821-SMG was acquired in small quantities by the Italian Ministry of Interior and distributed to the NOCS team of the Italian Police,Italian Ministry of Interior - Decree n¬∞ 559/A/1/ORG/DIP.GP/14 of March 6, 2009, concerning weapons and equipment in use with the Italian National Police - in Italian Retrieved on August 25, 2010. and possibly to other unknown Italian units or organizations. The SOCIMI Type 821-SMG never went to become the standard sub-machinegun of any Italian force, as SOCIMI went bankrupt in 1992 and the production of their assault weapons system (including the Type 821-SMG) was halted to be never reprised again. Franchi, owned by SOCIMI until the bankruptcy and undoubtedly the entity behind the development of the SOCIMI weapons system, offered shortly the Type 821-SMG as the \\"Franchi LF-821\\" with no success; it was ultimately acquired by the Beretta Holding and as such stopped development and production of all strictly military-oriented firearms. The SOCIMI Type 821-SMG samples acquired by Italian forces are now kept in stock. Other samples of this and other SOCIMI firearms are kept in warehouses by Italian firms such as Luigi Franchi S.p.A. and Fiocchi Munizioni. Rumors of foreign sales can find no confirm whatsoever; before bankruptcy, SOCIMI had reached export agreements with a United States company called MTS Corporation, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Experimental developments from the SOCIMI Type 821-SMG include a special tactical briefcase for the full-size model, and the SOCIMI Type 821-5 Micro SMG, a compact version with an overall length of 250 millimetres; none of these ever passed the prototype stage.

Three types of this series are illustrated below. The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi (bull) symbol, the legend Sethu in Tamil with a crescent moon above. The obverse is similar to the contemporary Massa coins issued by the Kalinga and Pandyan rulers of the central Sri Lankan kingdom of Dambadeniya.

The king is Parakramabahu VI of Kotte and the coins are believed to have been issued by Sapumal Kumara (also known as Chempaka Perumal) who ruled Northern peninsula from nallur on behalf of the Kotte king, for some years. Although some writers have suggested that the lion represents Sinhala dominance over the Jaffna Kingdom, others have pointed out that the lion is stylistically Tamil, and unmistakably so. As illustrated above the lion symbol was used on Jaffna coins by Pallava rulers as well. The lion on the Rajadhiraja Chola II is very similar to the lion on the present Lion Flag of Sri Lanka. The Dutch period These heavy rough copper coins were struck by the Dutch East India Company to use in the Jaffna territory. They were issued in the denominations of 1 and 2 Stuivers. These coins are also referred to as 'Dutch dumps'.

In The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (2000). In the novel national service Billy Bones appears at the very outset of the story with a mysterious sea chest, looking for a wayside inn with a view of the sea but little. Bones decides upon the Admiral Benbow Inn where he asks to be addressed merely as \\"Captain\\". Though his down-payment for lodgings is adequate, even generous, he stays for many months and browbeats Jim Hawkins' father out of asking for more money even when his deposit has been spent. He does, however, pay Jim fourpence a month to keep watch for \\"a seafaring man with one leg\\". Though he seems sometimes on the verge of deciding this was a waste of money, he invariably relents. Most of the daytime is spent walking the cliffs and looking out to sea. A habitual drunkard, the Captain terrorizes the customers of the Benbow with his swearing, singing and general bullying. Yet he begins to attract customers by his very notoriety, and earns some admiration from locals who consider him a \\"real old salt\\". The winter after his arrival, the Captain is visited by Black Dog, a villainous-looking man with two fingers missing from his hand. There is a noisy argument between the two, which turns into a lively sword fight and the Captain drives off a wounded Black Dog. As soon as the unwelcome visitor is gone, the Captain suffers a stroke. He is tended to by Dr. Livesey, who discovers the real name of the Captain to be Billy Bones when his arm is bared as a prelude to a surgical bloodletting and the name is found tattooed there. The doctor saves Bones' life and tells him to lay off the alcohol, but Bones does not heed Livesey's warning. He is plainly weakened by his stroke and the shock of Black Dog's visit, and at one point Hawkins even hears him sing a country love song, a gentle relic of his innocent days as a youth. He admits to Jim Hawkins that he sailed with Captain Flint, the notorious pirate, and was first mate on his ship. This explains much of the mysterious circumstances and solitary behavior of the early part of the story. A few days later, a blind pirate known only as Pew reaches the inn, and Bones is plainly terrified. Pew slips a black spot into Bones's hand and departs. Immediately, Bones suffers a second stroke and dies. The pirates come nonetheless and ransack the inn. The attackers fail to find the map, as it is now in Hawkins' possession, but they destroy the inn, ruining the Hawkinses' livelihood. This prompts Hawkins and his companions to embark on a search for the treasure. Trivia *According to Bones' account book read by Hawkins and Livesey, Bones was a pirate for nearly 20 years. *According to Treasure Island map notes, Flint hid his treasure in August 1750 and Bones received the Map in July 1754 while Flint was dying. *According to Long John Silver's conversation with Dick Johnson, Blind Pew spent his share of treasure in one year and that for two years until his accidental death under the Revenue Officer's horse, he was starving and murdering - thus a tentative date for Treasure Island is 1756-1757. Other media * Billy Bones appears briefly in Disney's animated film Treasure Planet, voiced by Patrick McGoohan (in his final role) and portrayed as a tortoise/salamander-like alien. A wounded-dying pilot, he arrived near Jim's home to keep a Map to Treasure Planet safe from pirates, gives it to Jim and succumbs, not before warning Jim to \\"beware the Cyborg\\". * Billy Bones is portrayed by Billy Connolly in Muppet Treasure Island. * Billy Bones is portrayed by Tom Hopper in the Starz original series Black Sails. In the episode \\"VI.\\", Billy's full name is revealed as William \\"Bones\\" Manderly. The episode \\"XVI\\" revealed that he was the son of anti-impressment activists in Kensington, and was himself press-ganged while handing out pamphlets on the subject. He was essentially enslaved for three years until Captain Flint freed him, at which point Billy killed his former captor and chose to remain a pirate because he felt he couldn't go home and face his family after doing so. * In the 1967 Lost in Space episode \\"Treasure of the Lost Planet\\" (23rd episode of season 2), which contains many in-joke allusions to Treasure Island, a gang of inept spacefaring pirates arrive on the planet where the Space Family Robinson are stranded, and declare that they are searching for \\"Beelibones' treasure.\\" * Billy Bones is mentioned in the songs \\"Time For Heroes\\" by the Libertines and \\"The Tomahawk Kid\\" by the Sensational Alex Harvey Band. * In the 1971 anime film D≈çbutsu Takarajima, Billy Bones is portrayed as a one-legged, anthropomorphic cat on the run from the ruling council of Pirate Island because of his possession of Flint's map. He is later killed (off-screen) by a band of pirate assassins in the Admiral Bembo Inn soon after entrusting the map to Jim, the film's protagonist. * Subject of the song \\"Billy Bones And The White Bird\\" on Elton John's Rock of the Westies album.

The word is derived from the local Wergaia word for 'sky', the Boorong Aboriginal people of the area being distinguished for their interest in star-lore. The Boorong people, with their astronomical traditions, told stories connected with constellations in the night sky. In the mid-2010s, the lake became a tourist mecca, particularly among the Chinese. It's a popular spot for photographers and social media users who take snaps of the lake's mirror-like surface during winter, when ground water percolates to the surface and inflows arrive from the Avoca/Tyrrell creek system. Lake Tyrrell's mirror-like surface During this time of cold weather, people are able to walk into the shallow lake without sinking in or getting feet muddy by finding areas where salt has formed a solid floor. Lake Tyrrell's solid salt floor Salt crust Location and features The lake covers approximately ,Advance Sea Lake Inc. , 2013The Age Traveller - Sea Lake making it Victoria's largest salt lake. It is located north of the town of Sea Lake and northwest of Melbourne. While much of the time the lake is dry, it is usually covered in about of water in winter.Jochen Brocks' Biogeochemistry Group ANU It is ancient and probably formed by sand blocking the passage of Tyrrell Creek (a distributary of the Avoca River) which feeds the lake. Evaporation results in a layer of salt crusting on the lake bed which is harvested by Cheetham Salt in Sea Lake. The lake environment is host to Mallee reptiles, kangaroos, emus and the white-fronted chat, an insectivorous bird. Thousands of seagulls breed on small islands on the lake. Surrounding vegetation is made up of saltbush and samphire, which supports a range of wildlife. To the east, the lunette contains significant Aboriginal relics. History Around 120,000 years ago Tyrrell was approximately deep with low salinity. Water levels subsequently dropped due to climatic changes, resulting in cycles of drying and partial refilling. In 1838, Australian explorer Edward Eyre was the first non-indigenous person to document Lake Tyrrell. He was searching for new grazing land. Recreation activities Each year on the Queen's Birthday long weekend the lake hosts the Mallee Rally, once part of the Australian Off Road Championship and more recently Australian Off Road Racing Series.

After seven seasons, the last two under head coach Phil Bengtson, he signed with the Dolphins in May 1970. Fleming was with the Dolphins for five seasons (and three Super Bowls), then was traded to the Washington Redskins for running back Charley Harraway. He was in the Redskins' 1975 training camp under George Allen, but missed the final cut in September and retired. Fleming was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2010.http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8147d121&template;=with-video- with-comments&confirm;=true Personal Fleming was the victim of an identity theft scam in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Arthur Lee Trotter posed as Fleming and was arrested in Texas in 1980 for selling phony stock in NFL teams. Caught, Trotter conceded to police that he was not Fleming: he said he was actually former Baltimore Colts star John Mackey. Fleming and receiver Roy Jefferson (b.1943) are cousins less than two years apart and grew up together in Compton. They played football at Compton High School and college football at Utah. Both on offense, the two were on opposing teams in Super Bowl VII, Fleming on the Dolphins and Jefferson on the Redskins.

Biography Hashimoto was born in Wakayama prefecture. He graduated from the 41st class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1913. He was ranked 43rd in a class of 118 cadets. As a midshipman, he was assigned to the cruisers Asama and Chikuma. On receiving his commission as ensign, he was assigned back to Chikuma, then to Yahagi. After attending torpedo school and naval artillery school, Hashimoto served on the destroyer Kamikaze. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1919, and served on the destroyer Kaede, as executive officer on destroyer Hasu, chief torpedo officer on destroyer Okikaze and (in 1923), captain of the destroyer Nashi. After graduating from the 24th class of Naval Staff College in 1924 and his promotion to lieutenant commander, Hashimoto was assigned to the staff of the Kure Naval District. He was promoted to commander in 1930. Hashimoto served as commander of various destroyer task forces through the 1930s, winning promotion to captain in 1935. He was Chief of Staff of the Ryojun Guard District from 1937‚Äì1939, and assumed command of the cruiser Chikuma from 1939‚Äì1940 and battleship Hy≈´ga from 1940‚Äì1941. He was promoted to rear admiral on 15 October 1941. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hashimoto was in command of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, covering landings of Japanese forces in Malaya. From August until late-November, 1942, he commanded Tokyo Express missions during the Guadalcanal Campaign. In January 1943, Hashimoto's destroyers participated in ‚ÄúOperation Ke‚Äù, and successfully evacuated 11,700 surviving Japanese troops from Guadalcanal. From March to October 1943, Hashimoto received a shore assignment and became Commandant of the Torpedo School. Assigned to command the 5th Cruiser Division in November 1943, he was promoted to vice admiral on 15 October 1944. From his flagship, the cruiser Haguro, he commanded the 5th Cruiser Division, which was defeated by Royal Navy warships during the Battle of the Malacca Strait on 16 May 1945. Haguro and the destroyer Kamikaze were in the Bay of Bengal off the northern tip of Sumatra attempting to transport food and supplies to the Japanese garrison in the Andaman Islands when they were ambushed by five British destroyers. During the battle, Haguro was hit repeatedly by torpedoes and gunfire. She sank, and Admiral Hashimoto was killed.

The image's text is often idiosyncratic and intentionally grammatically incorrect, and is known as lolspeak. Lolcat is a compound word of the acronymic abbreviation LOL (laugh out loud) and the word \\"cat\\". A synonym for lolcat is cat macro or cat meme, since the images are a type of image macro and also a well-known genre of meme. Lolcats are commonly designed for photo sharing imageboards and other Internet forums.  History  1905 cat postcard by upright British portrait photographer Harry Pointer created a carte de visite series featuring cats posed in various situations in the early 1870s. To these he usually added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal. Other notable early figures include Harry Whittier Frees and (using mounted animals) Walter Potter. The first recorded use of the term \\"lolcat\\" was used on 4chan, an anonymous imageboard. The word \\"Lolcat\\" was in use as early as June 2006, and the domain name \`lolcats.com\` was registered on June 14, 2006. Their popularity was spread through usage on forums such as Something Awful. The News Journal states that \\"some trace the lolcats back to the site 4chan, which features bizarre cat pictures on Saturdays, or 'Caturdays'.\\" Ikenburg adds that the images have been \\"slinking around the Internet for years under various labels, but they did not become a sensation until early 2007 with the advent of I Can Has Cheezburger?\\"\\"Lolcats' demented captions create a new Web language,\\" Tamara Ikenberg, The News Journal, July 9, 2007 The first image on \\"I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?\\" was posted on January 11, 2007, and was allegedly from the Something Awful website.\\"\\"Original Picture, cheezburger, ICANHASCHEEZBURGER, September 26, 2007 icanhascheezburger.com Lev Grossman of Time wrote that the oldest known example \\"probably dates to 2006\\", but later corrected himself in a blog post where he recanted his statement based on the anecdotal evidence readers had sent him, placing the origin of \\"Caturday\\" and many of the images now known by a few as \\"lolcats\\" in early 2005. The domain name \\"caturday.com\\" was registered on April 30, 2005. The term lolcat gained national media attention in the United States when it was covered by Time, which wrote that non-commercialized phenomena of the sort are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have \\"a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, Usenet feel to [them]\\". Partial scan of the print edition: fcrunk.wellimean.com Entertainment Weekly put them on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Da cutest distractshun of da decaid?

In December 2014, the word lolcat entered the Oxford English Dictionary, appearing in its online version.  Format  A lolcat image using the \\"I'm in ur...\\" format Lolcat is a compound word made from \\"lol\\" and \\"cat\\". \\"Lol\\" stands for \\"Laugh out Loud\\" or \\"Laughing out Loud\\"; hence, lolcats are intended to be funny and to include jokes. Lolcats images comprise a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically set in a heavy sans serif font such as Impact or Arial Black. The image is, on occasion, digitally edited for effect. The caption generally acts as a speech balloon encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard English spelling and grammar, featuring \\"conjugated verbs, but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar\\". The text parodies the grammar-poor patois stereotypically attributed to Internet slang. Frequently, lolcat captions take the form of phrasal templates. Some phrases have a known source, usually a well-known Internet meme, such as All your base are belong to us or Do not want, while others don't. The language of lolcats has also been likened to baby talk, however it draws on a variety of linguistic resources, not just the imitation of baby talk. Common themes include jokes of the form \\"Im in ur [noun], [verb]-ing ur [related noun].\\" Many lolcat images capture cats performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use modern technology, such as computers. There are several well- known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, including \\"Ceiling Cat\\" (see below). Others include Fail (a cat with a slice of processed cheese on its face) and \\"I Can Has Cheezburger\\" (a portrait of a blue British Shorthair). Another popular format is \\"[Adjective] cat is [adjective/noun].\\"  Recurring characters  Ceiling Cat (2016) by Eva and Franco Mattes, a taxidermy cat installation at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art \\"Ceiling Cat\\" is a character spawned by the meme. The original image was an image macro with a picture of a cat looking out of a hole in a ceiling, captioned \\"Ceiling Cat is watching you masturbate.\\" There followed numerous examples with the format \\"Ceiling Cat is watching you [verb ending in / rhyming with -ate]\\" with Ceiling Cat superimposed in the upper left hand corner of an image macro depicting the appropriate action. The underlying theme is that the cat is looking down on one, almost in a form of judgment. \\"Ceiling Cat\\" and the corresponding \\"Basement Cat\\" (a black cat who lives in the basement) represent good and evil in the lolcat universe, and in some cases God and Satan, as in the LOLCat Bible Translation Project. Ceiling Cat by Eva and Franco Mattes, a 2016 taxidermy cat installation mimicking the meme, is in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  Offshoots and parodies  Variations on the lolcat concept include captioning photos of other animals in a similar style (e.g. loldogs for dogs, etc.). The syntax of lolcat captions was used as the basis for LOLCODE, an esoteric programming language with interpreters and compilers available in .NET Framework, Perl, etc. In the computer game Minecraft, there is an option to change language settings to LOLCAT. Another example is Polandball, which uses broken English, reminiscent of the lolcat meme. \`lolcat\`, a variant of the Unix utility \`cat\`, outputs text in rainbow colours.

It is the largest volcano and highest point in the distance between Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson. Located just outside the Olallie Scenic Area, it is surrounded by more than 200 lakes and ponds fed by runoff, precipitation, and underground seepage, which are popular spots for fishing, boating, and swimming. The butte forms a prominent feature in the Mount Jefferson region and is usually covered with snow during the winter and spring seasons. Part of a stretch of shield volcanoes in Oregon with an unusually low elevation, meaning they have undergone less erosion over time than surrounding volcanic centers, Olallie has been excavated by glacial erosion on its northeastern flank. Its central volcanic plug has also been exposed. Comparisons of its morphology with Mount Jefferson suggest an age for the butte between 70,000 and 100,000 years; there is no evidence that it has erupted within the past 25,000 years. Olallie Butte has a steep, conical shape that serves as a transitional morphology between steep, mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanoes like Mount McLoughlin and Mount Thielsen and flatter, mafic shields. It is made of basaltic andesite. A Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in 1915 but abandoned in 1967; the summit also had a cupola cabin from 1920 until its roof collapsed in 1982. Olallie gets its name from the Chinook Jargon word klallali, which means berries. Today, the butte lies within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. The Pacific Crest Trail passes over the western side of the butte, and there are other trails that reach the mountain's summit. Although the main trail to the summit is not well maintained, it still remains open to hikers.  Geography  Olallie Butte is located within Jefferson, Marion, and Wasco counties, all within the northwestern to north-central part of the U.S. state of Oregon. The volcano lies just outside the irregularly shaped Olallie Roadless Area, which lies within the Mount Hood National Forest to the west of the major crest of the Cascade Range and directly north of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. This region encompasses of an upland area with small volcanoes, bordered to the southwest by the canyon wall of the North Fork of the Breitenbush River. It can be accessed from trails running from the Clackamas and Breitenbush River drainages, which reach the eastern and southern parts of the Olallie Area, as well as logging roads that enter the Olallie roadless area at its northern portion. Williams (1916) reported that Olallie Butte had a number of small, unnamed lakes, particularly concentrated at its southern base, which were mostly shallow. According to Johnson et al. (1985), dozens of these lakes were carved by the movement of glaciers over Olallie Butte. Olallie Lake is the largest of more than 200 bodies of water near Olallie Butte's base and contained in the Olallie Lake Scenic Area in Mount Hood National Forest's southern segment. Fed by runoff, precipitation, and subsurface seepage, Olallie Lake otherwise has no clear source of inflow or outflow, nor do many other lakes in the Olallie Butte area. To maintain Olallie Lake's water level, a low dam was built on the Mill Creek outlet, which flows east to Long Lake. Shitike Creek heads between Olallie Butte and Mount Jefferson, coursing east to the Warm Springs community before it joins the Deschutes River. Usually covered with snow in the winter and spring seasons, Olallie Butte is a prominent feature in the Mount Jefferson region. According to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, Olallie Butte has an elevation of ; the Geographic Names Information System lists its elevation as , while Hildreth (2007) lists it at . It has a proximal relief and distal relief of and , respectively. Olallie Butte has a total volume of . The cinder cone lies north of Mount Jefferson and to the northeast of Olallie Lake. Olallie Butte can be reached from Oregon Route 22 by following Breitenbush Road to the Olallie Lake Guard Station, then continuing on the main road along the transmission line. A trail to the summit of the mountain and a station runs for about from a trail marker located past a clearing on the main road; trucks cannot continue past this point.  Ecology  Forest stands near Olallie Butte reflect their elevation in the Cascade Range and predominantly include lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, noble fir, Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, and western white pine. Less common trees in the forested region include Alaska yellow cedar, alpine fir, Douglas fir, western red cedar, and whitebark pine; there are also a number of meadows, including Olallie Meadow, which covers an area of north of the Butte. Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle infestations have threatened the lodgepole pine trees throughout the area. Timber harvests are uncommon because forest managers want to keep trees for recreational purposes. Olallie Lake has osprey nests on its shores. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife stocks the lake each year with rainbow trout as well as brook trout, and kokanee salmon can also be found in the water. The lake is surrounded by huckleberry plants, which are typically ripe by the end of August. Possessing an average depth of , Olallie Lake is shallow with rock-bottomed littoral zones and low mineral concentrations of ions, possibly because snow and rain supply most of its water. Low chlorophyll and phosphorus concentrations mean that its water is quite transparent, and its bottom is visible even at its deepest point, at . Olallie Lake is ultraoligotrophic, with very low phytoplankton populations and no macrophyte growth at the lake bottom. The lake also sustains cool temperatures throughout the year, including the summer season. In 1975, the Bonneville Power Administration drafted an Environmental Impact Statement for a proposed route through the area, noting that it would disturb the locale's cold, shallow rocky soil, which take long periods of time to form.  Geology  The view from the top of Olallie Butte Part of the High Cascades segment of the larger Cascade Range, Olallie Butte is part of a stretch of shield volcanoes in Oregon with an unusually low elevation, meaning they have undergone less erosion over time than surrounding volcanic centers. Olallie Butte forms part of the Jefferson Reach, an axis of shield volcanoes, scoria cones, and lava domes in width that contains at least 175 Quaternary volcanoes. The Jefferson Reach's northern portion has an unusually low number of young volcanic centers (early Pleistocene or younger). The subsection including Olallie Butte consists mostly of Pleistocene or younger volcanoes, which are often glaciated. Of these volcanic vents, Olallie Butte and Sisi Butte are the two largest mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) shield volcanoes. Olallie Butte marks part of a region of basaltic andesite eruptions, also prominent at Three Fingered Jack, that extends north and south from Mount Jefferson. Olallie Butte is considered a shield volcano, though it has a conical shape that serves as a transitional morphology between steep, mafic volcanoes like Mount McLoughlin and Mount Thielsen and flatter, mafic shields. Made of basaltic andesite, it has a mafic composition. Nearby volcanic vents include the Sisi Butte, South Pinhead, and West Pinhead shield volcanoes and the Fort Butte, North Pinhead, and Potato Butte cinder cones. Cinder cones in the area have gray-red cinders that have been oxidized, scoria, agglomerate, and small lava flows consisting of porphyritic basaltic andesite and black and yellow-brown to dark yellow-orange, palagonite basaltic andesite. The black and orange color of some of the eruptive material from these cones suggests that there was interaction of the lava with wet ground or snow, causing rapid chilling of the ejecta that prevented oxidation from taking place. At Double Peaks and an unnamed hill southwest of View Lake, there are gray-pink to light brown-gray hornblende dacite lava domes. The volcanic cones at Olallie Butte and Mount Jefferson were erupted over deposits from the Minto lava group, which have been deeply eroded to create non-conforming surfaces. As a result, Olallie Butte has a relatively steeper slope, but there are lithologic similarities between the Olallie lavas and Minto lavas. Whereas Minto volcanoes follow a narrow, nearly linear arrangement south of Olallie Butte, north of Olallie the local volcanoes exhibit a scattered distribution across the plateau of the High Cascades. There are also transitional volcanoes not easily classified into either the Minto or Olallie group; their acidic composition suggests that they differentiated during the Minto eruptive phase, but progressive differentiation has been observed in the region, making definite conclusions about their categorization difficult. Unlike Sisi Butte, Olallie Butte has undergone relatively little erosion. Glacial erosion exposed the central volcanic plug and excavated troughs on Olallie's northeastern side, suggesting that the volcano is at least 25,000 years old. Part of the steepness of lower slopes at Olallie can be explained by glacial erosion by an ice sheet somewhere between in thickness, which previously covered the Olallie area. Glacial till, consisting of angular blocks of basaltic andesite and andesite, forms a veneer throughout the Olallie area, covering about 50 percent of the land, so systematic geochemical samples are generally not considered informative for volcanic rocks near the Butte. The volcanic rock that can be studied is of Cenozoic age, consisting mostly of basaltic andesite and andesite lava flows and associated breccias. Most of these have a porphyritic texture, containing phenocrysts; basaltic andesite deposit phenocrysts are made of minerals like light to dark-gray hypersthene, clinopyroxene, or olivine, and the andesitic deposits have minerals such as platy pyroxene or olivine. Labradorite phenocrysts are common among both the basaltic andesite and regular andesite deposits, while magnetite is more rare. There has been very little geological alteration of these rocks other than a few instances of alteration of olivine to iddingsite. All the rocks in the area show a normal magnetic polarity, indicating ages less than one million years and corroborating that they are of Pleistocene age. The domes at Double Peaks and southwest of View Lake have phenocrysts with andesine and dark red- brown basaltic hornblende, the latter of which contained altered magnetite, iron oxide hematite, and other unspecified minerals. Walker (1982) determined that the Olallie area was not a potential source for commercial deposits of minerals besides low-value rock that might be harvested for construction. However, there were other, better deposits of similar rock materials at more accessible locales nearby. Moreover, no studies have identified fuel repositories in the Olallie area, though Clackamas, Jefferson, Marion, and Wasco counties have been noted for having hot springs and therefore might serve as a future source of geothermal energy. None have been identified within the Olallie region, but they may be present and hidden by more recent rock layers or the cooling of rising thermal water. = Eruptive history = Olallie Butte is at least 25,000 years old, making it of Pleistocene age. It was likely built up by eruptions prior to the last glacial period. Comparisons of its morphology with Mount Jefferson suggest an age between 70,000 and 100,000 years. Thayer (1939) grouped eruptive activity at Olallie Butte with deposits at Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood, and Crater Lake (Mount Mazama) into the Olallie Lava group, which display highly variable thicknesses ranging from extremely thin to up to . Olallie Butte has not erupted within the past 10,000 years during the Holocene epoch. The biggest threat in the local region is from lava flows. There are also a number of dacite lava domes, which could collapse and generate small but dangerous pyroclastic flows or mudflows known as lahars.  Human history  Olallie Butte was named in 1915 by the United States Board on Geographic Names. In 1921, they listed it within Marion and Wasco County, but later revised this to also list Olallie Butte as a feature within Jefferson County, Oregon. The Olallie Lake Resort, built in 1932, sits at a remote location in the Olallie Scenic Area. Open from June to October, it has a general store, rowboats, 10 cabins with wood-burning stoves, and no phone or internet service. There is also no electricity, gas, or ATM service. The name Olallie derives from the Chinook Jargon klallali, which means berries; the term was historically used to refer to huckleberry. Olallie Butte is part of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, and the Olallie Lake Scenic Area borders the reservation. Olallie Butte has at its summit a United States Forest Service fire lookout tower, which was built in 1915 with a cab and tent cabin. It stands at a height of . The mountain summit also had a cupola cabin beginning in 1920, though it was abandoned in 1967 and the roof collapsed in 1982. The structure's remains can still be seen on top of Olallie Butte. Olallie Butte is also close to a power transmission line corridor. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a two-story cabin, now known as the Olallie Lake Guard Station Cabin, at the south end of the Mount Hood National Forest for local forest rangers. With a rustic architectural style, it exemplifies buildings from the Depression period. In 1991, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It now operates as a cabin for visitors, with a kitchen, living room, bunk bedroom, and loft for up to eight guests. Its lighting and refrigerator are fueled with propane, and it also has a stove, oven, water tank, and vault toilet. Located at an elevation of about , it can be reached by motorized vehicles, though snow may impede access to the cabin.  Recreation  Olallie Lake is a popular destination for fishing; swimming and boats are not allowed there, though swimming is allowed at the nearby Head Lake. Boat rentals, as well as life jackets, are available through the Olallie Lake Resort. Part of the Pacific Crest Trail runs through the area. Pacific Crest Trail #2000 (Clackamas) extends for into the Olallie Lake Scenic Area, with a segment that traverses the western side of Olallie Butte towards Olallie Lake before entering the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. There are a number of other trails for hikers of all ability levels. One trail extends to the summit of the Butte and offers a panoramic view of north-central Oregon. There is also a trail running around Olallie Lake, also known as Olallie Lake Trail 731. The western side of the butte can be climbed via a non-maintained trail that gains in elevation from Forest Road 4220, north of Olallie Lake. This trail passes through tribal land, running for about in length to the summit, where it offers excellent views of Mount Jefferson. The round trip runs for about ; there is no shade or water on the hike. The United States Forest Service manages seven campgrounds in the Olallie area, including three on Olallie Lake. They have pit toilets and lack running water; no reservation is required to camp at any of these grounds. Throughout the Olallie Scenic Area campgrounds, there are 97 sites, each with campfire rings and picnic tables. The campgrounds have quiet hours from 10 pm to 6 am. The Olallie Lake Guard Station Cabin, operated by the United States Forest Service, can also be reserved from June through September for a fee of $750 per night.

As well as doctor, he is a magistrate, an important man in the rural society of southwest England, where the story opens; his social position is marked by his always wearing a white wig‚Äîeven in the harsh conditions of the island on which the adventure takes place. Some years previously, he had fought in the Battle of Fontenoy, and was wounded in action during the battle. The doctor first appearsStevenson, Chapter 1: The Old Sea- dog at the Admiral Benbow, \\"Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient [...]\\" in the book when he comes to the \\"Admiral Benbow\\" to care for Jim Hawkins' ailing father, demonstrating courage and strength of character as he resists the attempts of pirate Billy Bones to bully him.Stevenson, Chapter 1: The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow, \\"The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath, \\"Silence, there, between decks!\\" \\"Were you addressing me, sir?\\" says the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, \\"I have only one thing to say to you, sir,\\" replies the doctor, \\"that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!\\" The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall. The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: \\"If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes.\\" Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog.\\" On Bones' subsequent death and the discovery of the treasure map, Dr. Livesey throws in his lot with Squire Trelawney's plans to recover Captain J. Flint's famous hoard. The cooler headed of the two, Dr. Livesey suggests discretion in recruiting a crew for the expedition, urging Trelawney to keep the purpose of the Hispaniola's voyage secret.Stevenson, Chapter 6: The Captain's Papers When Hawkins (now serving as cabin boy) discovers the pirates' plot, it is the doctor he seeks out to make his report.Stevenson, Chapter 12: Council of War, \\"Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \\"Doctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\\" Livesey keeps his head in the crisis and lets none of the crew see that he has just been given dreadful news. Thanks to his cool temperament, he, Captain Alexander Smollett, and the squire are able to plan their escape with the few men they can trust. The doctor himself narrates their subsequent flight from the shipStevenson, Chapter 16: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned and the establishing of their campStevenson, Chapter 17: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat's Last TripStevenson, Chapter 18: Narrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day's Fighting in the old stockade on the island.Stevenson, Chapter 19: Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade Later, when ship's cook Long John Silver and the crew attack, the doctor‚Äîa battle-hardened veteran‚Äîfights wellStevenson, Chapter 16: \\"I was not new to violent death‚ÄîI have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy‚Äîbut I know my pulse went dot and carry one.\\" and, with Captain Smollett wounded, takes responsibility for the safety of the expedition. Acting on Jim's account of his earlier adventures, he sets out to find Ben Gunn and succeeds in winning the castaway's loyalty with the offer of a small Parmesan cheese, a foodstuff for which Gunn has been pining through three years of living on goat meat. He negotiates a truce with Silver by agreeing to surrender the treasure map, which he (but not Silver) now knows to be useless. During the subsequent battle at the site of the plundered cache, he arrives opportunely to orchestrate the rescue of Jim and, as it turns out, Silver. Dr. Livesey, though at one point earning a merited rebuke from Captain Smollett for inattention to his post,Stevenson, Chapter 17:\\"Doctor, I thought you had worn the king's coat! If that was how you served at Fontenoy, sir, you'd have been better in your berth.\\" likely has the largest share of the credit for the expedition's success. He can very well be considered the hero of the story. Without him, the whole expedition would have been a disaster. Devoted to his Hippocratic Oath, Dr. Livesey feels duty bound to treat wounded and ill pirates, even though they are enemies who tried to kill him and might try again. Stevenson does not describe Dr. Livesey; he lets the doctor describe himself in actions. He is intelligent, brave and cool headed‚Äîqualities that win the day against the cunning and ruthlessness of his formidable adversary Silver.

It was succeeded by the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1952, and finally became what is known today as the Czech Academy of Sciences in 1992. History Festive audience of the Society members with the Emperor Leopold II, 1790 The Society was founded by filologist Josef Dobrovsk√Ω, historian Gelasius Dobner and mathematician and the founder of Prague University Observatory, Joseph Stepling. Later it was headed by historian and politician Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω. As early as 1861‚Äì1863 anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ proposed in his treatise Academia the establishment of an autonomous non- university scientific institution associating research institutes representing the main fields of the science of that time. This idea of an institution engaged in interdisciplinary research corresponds to the concept and structure of the present Academy of Sciences. By the end of the 19th century, language- differentiated scientific institutions arose in this country: the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Arts (, 1890‚Äì1952) and the Association for the Fostering of German Science, Arts and Literature in Bohemia (, 1891‚Äì1945). Czech Academy of Science and the Arts was founded owing to the significant financial support from Czech architect, entrepreneur and philanthropist Josef Hl√°vka, who became its first president. The aim of this institution was to promote the development of Czech science and literature and to support Czech arts. The most important work of this Academy was its publication activities. Scholarships and financial support were also provided and smaller research units arose upon its initiative as well. After the foundation of the independent Czechoslovak Republic (1918) other scientific institutions were established, such as the Masaryk Academy of Labour (Masarykova akademie pr√°ce) and autonomous state institutes, such as the Slavonic, Oriental and Archaeological Institutes. International relationships of Czech research institutions grew with their affiliation to the International Union of Academies and the International Research Council. After the totalitarian regime came to power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, all scientific, non-university institutions and learned societies were dissolved and instead the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences was founded. In 1992 the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic was established by Act No. 283/1992.

This cartridge is used almost exclusively in double rifles for hunting in the Tropics or hot climates in general and is associated with the Golden Age of African safaris and Indian shikars. Development The .450 Nitro Express was the first Nitro Express cartridge, developed around 1898 by John Rigby. This cartridge was based on the then popular .450 Black Powder Express case with of Cordite and a jacketed bullet. Muzzle velocity is listed at 2,150 feet per second (655 m/s) with of muzzle energy. This straight case has a length of with a rim. Early cartridges used the black powder case that was designed for around 22,000 psi and not the 34,000 psi that the Cordite load generated. Case extraction was difficult, especially in warmer climates such as Africa and India where the cartridge was primarily used. To remedy this problem, a reinforced case was produced and Kynoch made a reduced load to lower the case pressure. Another problem lay in the sensitivity of Cordite, loads developed in the cool British climate performed differently in the tropical heat of Africa and India, resulting in excessive pressures. The manufacturers responded by developing \\"tropical loads\\" with reduced propellant. These initial problems led to Holland & Holland developing the .500/450 Nitro Express and Eley Brothers developing the .450 No 2 Nitro Express, both of which offered very similar performance to the original .450 Nitro Express. By the time these two cartridges appeared, the early issues with the .450 Nitro Express had been resolved, and it quickly became the most popular and widely used dangerous game hunting round. Following the British Army 1907 ban of .450 caliber ammunition into India and the Sudan, instead of developing their own replacement Rigby adopted Joseph Lang's .470 Nitro Express as their standard double rifle cartridge. By the time the ban was lifted the .470 NE had largely supplanted the .450 NE as the industry's most popular elephant cartridge, and Mauser's Gewehr 98 bolt actioned rifles offered cheaper alternatives to the expensive double rifles required by the Nitro Express cartridges. WWI service In 1914 and early 1915, German snipers were engaging British Army positions with impunity from behind steel plates that were impervious to .303 British ball ammunition. In an attempt to counter this threat, the British War Office purchased 62 large bore sporting rifles from British rifle makers, including 47 .450 caliber rifles, which were issued to Regiments, some British officers also supplied their own. On one notable occasion, Richard \\"Dickie\\" Cooper brought down three Albatros D.III fighters from Ernst Udet's squadron, Jagdstaffel 15, with his Holland & Holland .450 Nitro Express big-game double rifle. Cooper is recorded as saying: \\"I aimed well ahead of the leader. He came down like a pheasant, as did the one that followed, and I had time to reload and fire again at the third before he passed over - he also crashed.\\" Users Prominent users of the .450 Nitro Express include Agnes Herbert, Arthur H. Neumann, Major Chauncey H. Stigand and Denys Finch Hatton, the latter had a gunsmith rebarrel his .475 No 2 Nitro Express Lancaster double rifle into .450 Nitro Express as it was easier to find ammunition.

He ranked 73rd out of 144 cadets. He served as midshipman on the cruisers and from 1912‚Äì1913, and after commissioning as an ensign in 1915, was assigned to the cruiser . He returned to naval artillery and torpedo school later that year, and did not graduate until late 1917, so he was unable to participate in combat operations in World War I. As a lieutenant from 1918, lieutenant commander from 1924, and commander from 1930, he served as chief gunnery officer on the destroyers and , cruisers , and , and battleships , and . He was promoted to captain on 15 November 1934. Abe was given his first command on 15 November 1935, the cruiser . He subsequently served as captain of Naka, , , , and in the 1930s. Abe was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1940. He commanded the transport division for the Port Moresby Invasion Force in abortive Operation Mo during the Battle of the Coral Sea. =The Makin Raid incident= From 5 February 1942 ‚Äì 29 November 1943, Abe was commander of the 6th Base Force at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. As such, he was essentially the wartime military governor of the Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, Nauru, Ocean Island and Wake Island in the central Pacific Ocean. On 17‚Äì18 August 1942, a force of approximately 200 US Marine commandos landed by submarine and raided Makin Island. The Makin Island raid was intended to destroy Japanese installations, gather intelligence data, test raiding tactics, boost home front morale, and possibly to divert Japanese attention from Guadalcanal. At a loss of 30 men, the US Marines killed the 85 - 160 Japanese, destroyed the radio station, fuel depot, supplies and installations. The raid attracted much attention in the American press, spawning a 1942 propaganda movie entitled Gung Ho!. Nine US Marines who had been accidentally left behind during the raid were captured by Japanese forces, and moved as prisoners of war to Kwajalein, where they were held for about a month. The initial plan was to send those American prisoners to Japan for incarceration. However, reportedly over the protests of Captain Yoshio Obara (local Japanese commander on Kwajalein) and Commander Hiusakichi Naiki (Chief of military-police on Kwajalein) (although this has been disputed by historian W. Emerson Wiles who states that Obara and Naiki were willing participants), Abe ordered the execution of the prisoners by beheading on 16 October 1942.Whitman, Submarine Commandos Personal Report of Howard Ward Personal Howard O.

It literally means \\"wandering vigilante\\", but is commonly translated as \\"knight-errant\\" or less commonly as \\"cavalier\\", \\"adventurer\\", \\"soldier of fortune\\" or \\"underworld stalwart\\".Liu, James J. Y. The Chinese Knight Errant. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967, p. xii. Background Of the two characters of the term, y√≥u (ÈÅä) literally means to \\"wander\\", \\"travel\\" or \\"move around\\", and xi√° (‰ø†) means someone with power who helps others in need. The term refers to the way these men solely travelled the land using physical force or political influence to right the wrongs done to the common people by the powers that be, often judged by their personal codes of chivalry. Youxia did not come from any social class in particular. Various historical documents, wuxia novels and folktales describe them as being princes, government officials, poets, musicians, physicians, professional soldiers, merchants, monks and even humble farmers and butchers. Some were just as handy with a calligraphy brush as others were with swords and spears. The xia originated in and were associated with the Mohist ideology, which stressed the importance of equality. At the end of the Warring States Period, former shi knights who did not transition into scholar-officials became xia as Mohist defenders of the weak. The 16th and 17th century saw a great revival in the xia culture of using martial arts to right wrongs. Some of these were recruited to serve in the Ming resistance against the Qing. According to Dr. James J. Y. Liu (1926‚Äì1986), a professor of Chinese and comparative literature at Stanford University, it was a person's temperament and need for freedom, and not their social status, that caused them to roam the land and help those in need. Dr. Liu believes this is because a very large majority of these knights came from northern China, which borders the territory of \\"northern nomadic tribes, whose way of life stressed freedom of movement and military virtues\\". Many knights seem to have come from Hebei and Henan provinces. A large majority of the characters from the Water Margin, which is considered one of China's best examples of knight-errant literature, come from these provinces.Shi, Nai‚Äôan and Luo Guanzhong. Outlaws of the Marsh. Trans. Sidney Shapiro. Beijing: Foreign Language Press, 1993 () In poetry One good example of Youxia poetry is The Swordsman (ÂâëÂÆ¢) by Jia Dao (Tang Dynasty): > For ten years I have been polishing this sword; Its frosty edge has never > been put to the test. Now I am holding it and showing it to you, sir: Is > there anyone suffering from injustice?Liu, p. 68. According to Dr. Liu, Jia's poem \\"seems...to sum up the spirit of knight- errantry in four lines. At the same time, one can also take it as a reflection of the desire of all those who have prepared themselves for years to put their abilities to the test for some justice.\\" A metric translation of the original Chinese poem with one iamb per Chinese characterTian Min, 2020.

Born at Ciempozuelos, Rodr√≠guez was the son of a bricklayer. In 1727, he collaborated with his father in the work at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. Major works Ventura's career was remarkably prolific. Between 1749 and 1753, he built the church of San Marcos in Madrid. In 1752, he was named the director of architectural studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. Holy chapel of the left In 1750, he was commissioned with finishing and remodeling the bas√≠lica del Pilar of Zaragoza. Earlier plans by Felipe Busi√±ac, Felipe S√°nchez, and Francisco Herrera the Younger had not satisfied the demands of the municipality, a convenient distance from the river and proper alignment with the icon and other buildings. In the cathedral of Cuenca, Ventura was asked to construct a Transparente(a glass-roofed altar complex) similar to that made by Narciso Tom√© in the Cathedral of Toledo. Between 1755 and 1767, he decorated the interior of the church of the Royal Monastery of la Encarnaci√≥n, in Madrid. Then at his peak of influence, the Bourbon monarchs of Spain, Fernando VI and Carlos III began to favor foreign architects such as the French Jacques Marquet and the Neapolitan Francesco Sabatini (nephew of Luigi Vanvitelli). However, ensconced in 1766 in a role similar to buildings commissioner for the Council of Castile, Rodr√≠guez played a role in many works. Buildings or renovations needing official approval came to his purview, and often underwent his scrutiny and change.Art√≠culo de Do√±a Cristina Pina Caballero en Biblioteca Universitaria Digitum He aided in the design of the Convent of the Philippine Augustines of Valladolid, the college of surgery in Barcelona (1761, home today of the academy of Medicine), the town hall of Haro (1769), and his projects for a new National library and the factory of glass at La Granja. Principal facade of the Convent of the Philippine Augustines in Valladolid. Rodr√≠guez helped design the Palacio de Liria (1770) ; Palacio de Altamira (1773‚Äì1775) (now the European Institute of Design); the Palace of Infante Don Luis; the Palacio de Almanzora in Almer√≠a; and the Palace at Arenas de San Pedro (he also built the Royal Chapel for the Convent/Sanctuary of San Pedro de Alc√°ntara). He helped remodel the Palacio Municipal de Betanzos. Rodr√≠guez was named Maestro Mayor del Ayuntamiento of Madrid in 1764. Among other works are portions of the plaza mayor de √Åvila, the Hospital General de Madrid, the facade of the catedral de Toledo, the Sagrario (1761‚Äì1764) of the Cathedral of Ja√©n, the main retablo for Cathedral of Zamora (1765‚Äì1776), which replaced the one by Joaqu√≠n Benito Churriguera (brother of Jos√© Benito), that had been damaged by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the ermita de San Nicasio in Legan√©s (1772‚Äì1780, the baths at Caldas (1773), the sanatorium at Trillo (1775), the jail at Brihuega, and the church at Larravezna. He designed the facade of the cathedral of Pamplona in Neoclassic style. He created the present church at the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos; for this project, he almost destroyed all traces of earlier Romanesque constructions. He replaced Lucas Ferro Caaveiro, the original architect, in the rebuilding of the Abbey of San Juan Bautista de Corias in Asturias. Rodr√≠guez was unable to complete several important commissions, the Puerta de Alcal√° (finished by Sabatini en 1764), the Basilica of San Francisco el Grande in Madrid (also Sabatini in 1768), Also in Madrid, the refurbishment of the main plaza Puerta del Sol and the construction of the adjacent Real Casa de Correos postal service headquarters, both completed by Jaime Marquet between 1760 - 1768. The church of La Encarnaci√≥n (1785) in Santa Fe (Granada) was completed by his pupil Domingo Loys de Monteagudo. Of his works, the church for the Convento de San Norberto of the Premonstratensian order, no longer exists. It was torn down by Joseph Bonaparte, also known as Pepe Plazuelas, who was zealous in opening up plaza spaces in Madrid.

Bombay Reef (Paracel islands) as viewed from the International Space Station  History  In the early hours of 20 December 1946, en route from Hong Kong to Singapore for decommissioning, HMS Aire ran aground on Bombay Reef. She was spotted by chance, three days later, by the passing and the 85 crew, amongst them the ship's dog, were rescued with no serious casualties. As a , HMS Aire was sister ship to the famous superyacht . In early May 1967 the steel sailing schooner Dante Deo, with six men and a six-year-old boy on board, was wrecked on Bombay Reef. The crew were rescued on 5 May 1967 by an amphibious aircraft operated by the 37th Air Rescue Squadron. Bombay Reef is the site of numerous other shipwrecks, at least one of which is visible above water and on radar from 15 miles away.

Life Louise Etiennette Sidonie Sauze was born on 21 April 1902 at Boulogne sur Seine, Paris, France, the only child of Lucie Jeanne Alphonsine Guerin and her husband, Daniel Paul Louis Sauze, secretary to the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Louise remembered how as a child she would go with her father to Rodin's house at Meudon and play with chips of marble while the men talked. In Paris she met her future husband Hubert Henderson, a New Zealander. Hubert returned to New Zealand in 1923 and proposed to Louise, but propriety demanded that a single woman not travel alone to New Zealand. She was married to Hubert by proxy at the British Embassy in Paris before emigrating to New Zealand in 1925 and settling with her husband in Christchurch where she began studies at the Canterbury School of Art. After earning her diploma in 1931 she went on to teach at the school. In 1933 she gave birth to their only child, a daughter Diane. Henderson died in Auckland on 27 June 1994, aged 92. Education Henderson attended the Institut Maintenon from 1908 to 1919, passing her Brevet √©l√©mentaire in 1918. In 1919 she studied French literature, graduating with a baccalaur√©at, and from 1919 to 1921 she studied at l'√âcole de la broderie et dentelle de la ville de Paris, graduating as a designer in 1921. From 1922 to 1927 she was employed to draw blueprints and write articles on embroidery design and interior decoration for the weekly journal Madame. In 1923 she also contributed embroidery designs to a Belgian journal, La femme et le home. She frequented public art galleries and was authorised to study in the museum and library of the Mus√©e des Arts Decoratifs. Career In the early 1940s Henderson moved to Wellington and became interested in modernist concerns after seeing a number of cubist inspired paintings by John Weeks, with whom she was corresponding. During World War II she worked for The Correspondence School; she championed embroidery at this time, writing in the periodical Art in New Zealand and a manual which was published by the Army Education Welfare Service in 1945. In 1950 the family moved to Auckland and she attended the Elam School of Art but was frustrated by its conservatism. She continued to work in John Weeks' studio, however, and her work in this period became increasingly abstract and intellectual. In 1952, at Weeks's urging, and with her husband's support, Louise Henderson returned to Paris for a year to improve her knowledge of modern painting. She studied there under Cubist artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. On her return to Auckland she was recognised as one of the leading Modernist painters. An exhibition of Henderson's adaptations of the cubist style was held at the Auckland City Art Gallery shortly after she returned from Paris in 1952. This show combined with exhibitions over following years in both Auckland and Wellington established her reputation as a modern artist of note. Henderson's Canterbury paintings of hills, gorges and architectural forms blend observation with the visual language and aesthetic theories of the European moderns ‚Äì Manet, C√©zanne, Picasso and Braque. Her movement away from the topographical view of the landscape was shared by other local artists such as Alfred Cook, Rita Angus, Roland Hipkins and Christopher Perkins. In 1956 Henderson accompanied her husband to the Middle East when he was appointed a United Nations advisor. For three years she painted in Lebanon, Jordan, Iran and Iraq. She continued to employ a cubist approach, at times almost totally non-figurative, for the rest of her painting life. In the 1960s she was frequently professionally linked with the abstract painter Milan Mrkusich; they completed stained glass designs for the Church of the Holy Cross in Henderson, Auckland, and were also part of a touring exhibition of New Zealand artists' work sent to Brussels, London and Paris in 1965‚Äì66. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s Henderson frequently chose still life subjects as the starting point for paintings. All these works contain faceted abstraction in a traditionally cubist manner but still retain enough figurative fragments to enable the subject to be easily recognised. Henderson also frequently worked in tapestry. In the 1960s she designed a wool mural for the New Zealand Room at the Hilton Hotel in Hong Kong and made designs for the Talis Studio in Auckland, and regarded tapestry as just as important as her painting. Henderson continued to be an active painter well into her eighties. Her outstanding contribution to New Zealand painting was recognised in 1973 through the granting of a Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council fellowship. She completed a series of works, called The Twelve Months, when she was 85. Major exhibitions * 1935‚Äì1938: Henderson's first exhibition was with the New Zealand Society of Artists in Christchurch.

Even though the film was made during the World War II, the setting is a post-war Nuremberg-style war crimes trial. Alexander Knox plays Wilhelm Grimm, a Nazi officer who is on trial, and the story unfolds through the eyes of several witnesses, including a Catholic priest, Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Grimm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Marja Pacierkowski (Marsha Hunt), a woman to whom he was once engaged. Alfred Neumann and Joseph Than were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. Plot The film centers on the trial of Wilhelm Grimm, a war criminal. Each character witness provides a flashback scene to a previous part of Grimm's life. In the trial, it is revealed that Grimm (Alexander Knox), who fought for Germany in the World War I and lost a leg in battle, returns after the war to the small German village of Lidzbark (now part of Poland) where he had been a teacher. Despite the recent hostilities, he is welcomed back into the community and resumes his teaching. He also resumes his relationship with Marja Pacierkowski, a local Polish girl to whom he had become engaged before the war. He is bitter about Germany's losing the war and it is obvious he has been changed by the experience. He treats the villagers with disdain, and his upcoming marriage is cancelled. He calls his fianc√©e a \\"peasant\\" only interested in her wedding dowry. Taunted by the school's pupils, who say he is not fit to marry any Polish woman, he molests one of them, Anna, a young girl. The rape is blamed on her young male friend, Jan Stys, but Wilhelm's fianc√©e accidentally stumbles on the truth from Anna. The girl subsequently drowns herself in the lake. A mob gathers seeking vengeance, but a trial is required. Nevertheless, Jan throws a stone, putting out Wilhelm's left eye. After the trial fails to convict him, Wilhelm returns to Germany, after borrowing money from the priest and the rabbi. In Germany he goes to Munich to the house of his brother Karl, who is married with a young family. Karl clearly despises the Nazis, referring scornfully to \\"that Hitler creature\\". Karl cannot dissuade Wilhelm, though, and Wilhelm joins the Nazi Party and rises through its ranks. In 1929 he is sought by the police after the Nazi Party is made illegal. His nephew keeps the police at bay and Wilhelm rewards him with a swastika badge. As the Nazis grow in strength, Karl decides he has no option but to leave Germany and go to Vienna. He threatens to reveal Wilhelm's part in the Reichstag fire unless he joins them but, instead of doing so, Wilhelm turns them over to the authorities, sending his own brother to a concentration camp. He then arranges that Karl's son enters the Hitler Youth. When World War II starts, Grimm becomes the commander of the occupying force of the same village where he had previously lived. He treats the villagers brutally. He forces Marja, now a schoolteacher, to burn the children's books, saying they will be replaced by German books. He cruelly says that time has not treated her well and taunts her for rejecting him due to his leg injury. His nephew Willie, whom Wilhelm asserts that he treats as his own son, is now serving under him and pursuing Marja's daughter, Janina. Grimm, who is now a Reich Commissioner, next becomes involved in the large-scale deportation of the Jews and other minority groups. He commands the rabbi to quell dissent among the crowd as they are being placed on a train. The rabbi, knowing that they are going to die, instructs the crowd to rebel instead, upon which the Nazis turn machine guns onto the crowd. Wilhelm kills the rabbi with his pistol. Father Warecki exchanges final words with him as he dies. Willie finds Marja and Janina hiding Jan Stys, who is injured, but he leaves without Jan when Marja rebukes him, and seems to soften in his attitude. Wilhelm sends Janina to work at the \\"officers' club,\\" the Nazi name for enforced prostitution. Willie begs that she be released, to no avail. When Janina also dies, Grimm's nephew renounces his Nazi allegiance, having realized what an evil path Wilhelm has led him on. While Willie is praying by the side of Janina's body in the church, Wilhelm shoots him in the back. We return to the courtroom. Wilhelm refuses to accept the authority of the court and continues to spout Nazi propaganda. The judge leaves it to the people to decide Grimm's fate.

Roosevelt declare on August 21, 1942Jewish Virtual Library: Franklin Roosevelt Administration: Statement on Punishment of War Crimes Linked 2015-06-05 that the Allies were collecting information about the Nazi leaders responsible for war atrocities, in order to bring them to court after the war.New York Herald Tribune, October 10, 1943.AFI Catalog of Feature Films: None Shall Escape; accessed 2015-06-05. (The prosecution of war criminals was ratified by the Allies in the Moscow Declarations in 1943). He gathered Burt Kelly on to help produce and Lester Cole to write the script, both frequent partners in previous films. During production it was known as both \\"The Day Will Come\\" and \\"Lebensraum\\". To ensure the war crimes depicted in the film conformed to actual Nazi atrocities, the script was submitted to the U.S. State Department's Office of Information, OWI, and the United Nations for review. The film wanted to represent the Tribunal of the Warsaw District accurately during all stages as it was some of the first ever seen of humanity held accountable for its acts. Production began August 31, 1943 and finished October 26,1943 (i.e. more than eighteen months before the war in Europe ended.) Director Andre DeToth had seen the war up close already in 1939. He was filming newsreels in Hungary when the Germans invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and was immediately sent to cover the fighting on the German-Polish front. Reception Alfred Neumann and Joseph Than were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story, and the film is considered to be the first feature film to deal with Nazi atrocities against the Jews.

The mall was located in the Town of West Seneca at the intersection of Ridge Road (Erie CR 137) and Slade Avenue (Erie CR 91) immediately east of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90). The William Hengerer Company originally sought to develop a location on this site in the early 1960s. This eventually led to the development and opening of Seneca Mall in 1969 in direct competition to The Thruway Plaza. The mall at that time housed a large JCPenney store as well as local chain Sattler's. Seneca Mall was the major mall in the southtowns of Buffalo from its opening in 1969 through the 1980s. In 1985, the McKinley Mall opened in Hamburg less than away. Seneca hung on until 1989 when the Walden Galleria opened in Cheektowaga. At that time, all of the mall anchors vacated as well as most of the specialty stores and restaurants. The mall remained open until 1994, finally becoming a haven for mall walkers with no retailers. In 1994, the mall's owners, The Pyramid Company, elected to demolish the mall. The company, which also owns the Walden Galleria, elected to build a power center on the site once the mall and outlying buildings were demolished. The center was branded as The Shops at West Seneca and its first tenant (Tops Markets) opened in May 1997. Although many elaborate plans were put on the table by Pyramid, a Kmart store, which closed in late 2018 a part of a plan to close 142 Kmart and Sears stores, is the only other development. A majority of the former mall site remains fenced off. The big signs of Seneca Mall's entries are still standing as the only standing remains from 1969, reading \\"TOPS\\", with \\"Shops at West Seneca\\" above.

Origin and development The most important manuscript is Laud 610: folio 118Rb-121Va, which is missing the ending; Kuno Meyer and Gerard Murphy assigned the text to the 12th century.{ The Laud 610 manuscript text was edited and translated by John O'Donovan as \\"The Boyish Exploits of Finn mac Cumhaill\\" in 1859, but only partly with some deficiencies according to Kuno Meyer. Meyer published a 1881 edition followed by a 1904 translation entitled \\"The Boyish Exploits of Finn\\". A more recent translation appeared in Joseph Falaky Nagy, The Wisdom of the Outlaw: Boyhood Deeds of Finn in Gaelic Narrative Tradition (1985). The text breaks off while Fionn investigates a s√≠dhe or fairy mound, before his trip to Tara. Scholars have pointed out similarities between earlier versions of The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn and tales of the youth of the Ulster Cycle hero C√∫chulainn.Mackillop, Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, p. 318 \\"Macgn√≠martha Finn\\". For instance, The Boyhood Deeds of C√∫chulainn and The Wooing of Emer, both found within the epic T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge, recount C√∫chulainn's earning of a nickname through his feats, his training by a warrior woman (Sc√°thach) and his earning of a deadly spear (the G√°e Bulg). A modern retelling of the Boyhood Deeds occurs under the title \\"Birth of Fin Maccumhail\\"., p. 666 note 3. Plot The story begins with the death of Fionn's father Cumhal, leader of the Fianna, at the hands of Goll mac Morna. Cumhal's wife Muirne was pregnant at the time and eventually gave birth to their son, called Demne in his youth. Fearing for his safety, she sends the boy to be raised by Cumhal's sister, the druidess Bodhmall, and her companion Liath Luachra. The two warrior women raise him and accompany him on several adventures, including one in which he receives his nickname, Fionn (the fair; the pale). As he grows, his exploits attract increasing attention, and finally his foster mothers send him away for fear that Goll's men will find him. Subsequent episodes depict his service to the king of Bantry, his recovery of Cumhal's treasures by slaying Liath Luachra (a different character than his caretaker), and his meeting with the aged and dispossessed Fianna who had fought with his father. ;Finn's wisdom Another episode recounts how Fionn gained the ability to gain wisdom whenever he applied his thumb tooth his tooth. He developed this ability after inadvertently tasting the salmon which would grant universal knowledge to whoever consumed it. The salmon, which dwelled in the pool of F√©s, was coveted seven years by Finn's mentor, the poet Finn √âces. Finn cooked the salmon, obeying his mentor's instruction not to partake any of the salmon before serving it to him, but burnt his thumb while cooking and sucked it, thereby receiving its gift of wisdom. tr., \\"The Boyish Exploits of Finn\\", pp. 185‚Äì186 Though it is not stated explicitly, it is inferred that this was a Salmon of Wisdom that probably ate the hazelnuts at the Well of Segais. ;Fairy mound attack Fionn travels to the capital of Tara, which is set aflame each Samhain by Aill√©n the Burner, one of the Tuatha D√© Danann. Goll and the Fianna are powerless to stop it, since Aill√©n puts everyone to sleep with a magical tune. Fionn inhales poison from his own spear to prevent sleep, and dispatches Aill√©n. He reveals his identity to the court, and the king grants Fionn his rightful position as leader of the Fianna. Goll steps down, and engages in a truce with his enemy. tr., \\"The Boyish Exploits of Finn\\", pp. 180‚Äì190.  Mirrors and Parallels  Episodes about Finn and his family in the Macgn√≠martha Finn are also attested in other works in Irish literature. Some parallels with other Celtic or Norse culture has been discussed as well. ;Cath Cnucha The beginning episode telling of Cumhal mac Treanmhor's death is given in the narrative Cath Cnucha. A 17th century tale, \\"The Fight of Castle Knoc\\" discusses Cumhal's death and Liath Luachra's taking of the Corrbolg (construed as armor here, though this is Crane-bag elsewhere)., p. 665 note 3. ;Wisdom As for the acquisition of wisdom by tasting the salmon, this has been compared to the Welsh episode where Ceridwen's condensed brew in the cauldron of wisdom was unintendedly tasted by her son Morfran. Another close parallel is Sigurd the dragon-slayer who burns his finger cooking the heart of the dragon F√°fnir, and subsequently gains the ability to understand the conversation of birds.

Therefore, the game uses mainly the DS's touch screen. Gameplay The player has to drag Bub around using the stylus. Contact with enemies or dangerous objects such as spikes causes the player to lose a heart. When all hearts have been lost, the player loses a life and must begin the level anew. When the player drags the stylus anywhere on the screen that isn't Bub, the player can create a rainbow. The rainbow serves as a barrier through which enemies can't cross. If the rainbow is drawn over an enemy, the enemy is killed. Additionally, when the player taps a rainbow, it falls down removing any enemies that lie below.

In its first season in the Mayflower Athletic Conference, the Cougar lacrosse team won the league championship with a league record of 13-1 and an overall record of 14-4 which included a 1-1 record in the MIAA Division 3 tournament. The team was led by 4th year head coach, Justin Shay. In the 2009-2010 academic year, the boys' basketball and lacrosse teams were Mayflower League Champions. In the 2010-2011 academic year, a banner was raised in every single season. In the fall, the boys' soccer team had a 12-3-3 record on their road to their Mayflower League Championship, which was the first boys' soccer title since 1993. The girls' basketball team won the Mayflower League title in the winter and the softball team also won a title in the spring. In the winter of 2011, the boys' basketball team won the Mayflower League Championship under new first year head coach Matt Coute, who is the all-time leading scorer at Bishop Connolly and was the replacement of the longtime coaching legend Billy Shea. In the spring of 2012, the Bishop Connolly baseball team won the Mayflower League Championship and made an unforgettable run to the Division 4 South Sectional Finals after defeating Cape Cod Tech, Pope John Paul II, and West Bridgewater. On March 13, 2013, the boys' varsity basketball team won the Division IV State Championship at the TD Garden in Boston, MA. Bishop Connolly was recognized by Fall River Mayor William Flanagan and numerous state representatives. In 2015, the Cougars football team completed an undefeated regular season and won the Mayflower League championship. They qualified for the MIAA Division 6 playoffs, and drew the #3 seed in the tournament. The Cougars face off against small school powerhouse, and eventual state champions, Mashpee in the first round. The Cougars took a 7-6 lead into the fourth quarter, but the Falcons scored two fourth quarter touchdowns and upset the previously undefeated Cougars, 20-7. The Cougars were placed into the consolation bracket after being eliminated from the state playoffs, and they continued to dominate opponents. The Cougars football team finished the 2015 season with a 10-1 record, the best record in school history to date.

Amended Citizenship Act passage in 2008 On May 29, 2007, Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley (CPC) announced her proposal to amend the Citizenship Act. Under the proposal, anyone naturalized in Canada since 1947 would have citizenship even if they lost it under the 1947 Act. Also, anyone born since 1947 outside the country to a Canadian mother or father, in or out of wedlock, would have citizenship if they are the first generation born abroad. Appearing before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, Finley asserted that as of May 24, 2007, there were only 285 cases of individuals in Canada whose citizenship status needed to be resolved.Notes for an Address by The Honourable Diane Finley, PC, MP: Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration ‚ÄúMain Estimates and Loss of Citizenship‚Äù , Ottawa, Ontario, May 29, 2007 (archived from the original on 2007-06-07). Under the proposed legislation, anyone born before 1947 to a Canadian citizen abroad would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis; such individuals would have to apply for a ministerial permit. Bill C-37, which received Royal Assent on April 17, 2008, amended the Citizenship Act to give Canadian citizenship to those who lost or never had it due to certain provisions in existing and former legislation. The law came into effect on April 17, 2009, one year following Royal Assent. People who were citizens when the law came into force did not lose citizenship as a result of these amendments. The law was made retroactive to the time of birth or loss of citizenship, and gave citizenship to the following categories of people: *People who became citizens when the first citizenship act took effect on January 1, 1947 (including people born in Canada prior to 1947 and war brides) and who then lost their citizenship; *Anyone who was born in Canada or had become a Canadian citizen on or after January 1, 1947, and had then lost citizenship; and *Anyone born abroad to a Canadian citizen mother on or after January 1, 1947, if not already a citizen, but only if they were the first generation born abroad. The exceptions are those born in Canada to a foreign diplomat, those who renounced their citizenship with Canadian authorities, and those whose citizenship was revoked by the government because it was obtained by fraud. Cases not resolved by the modified law As of 2009, there are still some people who are sometimes referred to as Lost Canadians, including some children of war brides, children born out of wedlock during the Second World War, and Mennonites who have been refused citizenship by the Canadian government. As of 21 October 2009, there were currently 81 people who are asserted to be such cases, but this number is shrinking as the remaining people in this category die off. One person who died while waiting for citizenship (in February 2009) was Guy Valliere, a World War II veteran who had been publicly promised citizenship by Diane Finley. =Kasey Neal= Kasey Neal, aged two and a half as of 2010, was denied citizenship because her grandparent was a female Canadian rather than a male Canadian. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) claimed that she is not eligible because her parent was at first denied citizenship and then was later granted retroactive citizenship (which would seem to make her the daughter of a Canadian and thus ordinarily guarantee citizenship). The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Benner v. Canada (1997) that children of female Canadians are legally guaranteed all rights and privileges that children of male Canadians receive; however, this court decision was not interpreted by the CIC in favour of her case for citizenship. This denial of citizenship is being brought before judicial review and could lead to a class-action lawsuit if the Supreme Court's decision is ignored by CIC. =Priscilla Corrie= In September 2010, Priscilla Corrie (87), a \\"war bride\\", was denied a Canadian passport despite having received passports in the past and despite being on Old Age Pension and Canadian Pension Plan and having come to Canada when she was 20. Her passport was issued later that year, after the government was forced to act due to media coverage of the incident in the Vancouver Sun newspaper. =Sandra Burke= Sandra Burke came to Canada at six years of age with her Canadian father after her American mother died. He then abandoned her, and she was raised by her paternal grandmother in Toronto and P.E.I. She has been unable to produce copies of her entry documents to Canada, and , the Citizenship and Immigration office of Canada has refused to search their archives. In 2010, Burke was 66 and was facing possible removal as well as losing old age benefits.Vancouver Sun ‚Äì Are you sure you are Canadian? Can you prove it? On December 21, 2010, in Mississauga, Ontario, Burke was finally able to take her oath of statehood, after a lengthy fight and support from her MP. =Jackie Scott= The daughter of a Canadian soldier and a British-born mother naturalized as a Canadian citizen in 1955, Jackie Scott was refused a citizenship card in 2005. She was born while her father was stationed in England during the war in 1945; her parents were unmarried at the time. In 2013, Jackie Scott took her case to the courts to seek judicial review of her exclusion. =Byrdie Funk= Funk was born in Mexico to Canadian parents and moved back to Canada with them when she was two months old. Since then, Canada has been home and she holds no other citizenship. She was unaware of a law requiring people born overseas between 1977 and 1981 to parents also born abroad to apply to maintain their citizenship by the age of 28, and missed the deadline. The arcane rule was abolished in 2009, but the change was not retroactive. Funk joined the \\"Lost Canadians\\" group as she worked through the bureaucracy to regain her citizenship, which she regained on July 1, 2017. New \\"Lost Canadians\\" Bill C-37, which attempted to address the original phenomenon, included a provision that Canadian citizens by birth who were born outside Canada could not pass citizenship to their children born outside the country. This in turn has led to the potential creation of a new group of \\"Lost Canadians\\", with one notable example being Rachel Chandler, born in China to a Libya-born son of Canadian parents and a Chinese woman. Because her parents' marriage was not recognized by China at the time of her birth, she was not granted citizenship by China, and because she was born after Bill C-37 took effect, her father could not pass on his Canadian citizenship to her. This apparently rendered her stateless (which is against the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which Canada is a signatory). Chandler now holds an Irish passport. She was entitled to Irish citizenship through her Irish-born paternal grandfather. John Nicolas Fortin-Rodriguez of Magog, Quebec, born in Mexico in 2011 to Patrick Fortin (himself born abroad, the son of a Canadian soldier posted to CFB Lahr in Cold War-era West Germany) and Lucero Rodriguez (an immigrant from Mexico to Canada), holds a Mexican passport with a Canadian visa but has been denied Canadian citizenship due to being second generation born abroad. In addition, some people born abroad in the second and subsequent generations not entitled to citizenship under previous versions of the Citizenship Act, remain excluded due to the wording of changes which were part of Bill C-24 (2014). This limitation does not apply to people born before 2009 in similar circumstances, whose ancestor was not regularized by C-24. Notable \\"Lost Canadians\\" One notable Lost Canadian was Robert Goulet. He had provided evidence to support a claim of citizenship, but he died before it was approved.

A talented representative for Queensland and Australia, at the time he was picked for the national team he was the youngest ever player so selected. A prolific try-scorer, he has been named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.Century's Top 100 Players Background An Innisfail junior and younger brother of 1976 Queensland representative Ian Boustead, Boustead was a Queensland Schoolboy representative. Playing career =1970s= Boustead made his first grade d√©but with Innisfail Souths in 1977. He first represented for Queensland aged 18 in 1978 while playing for Innisfail Souths. Small in stature, Boustead outshone his giant New South Wales outside back rivals, Terry Fahey and Mark Harris, and that year he made his international representative d√©but at 18 years and 310 days in 1978 in a Test against New Zealand thus becoming the youngest ever player to represent Australia. He played in all three Tests of that series. Boustead then went on the 1978 Kangaroo tour. All up he made twenty-five Test appearances for Australia and played in eighteen minor matches on two Kangaroo tours, including playing in all six tests on the undefeated 1982 Kangaroo tour. That squad, coached by Frank Stanton and included veterans such as team captain Max Krilich, Craig Young, Rod Reddy, Ray Price, and a crop of new stars such as vice-captain Wally Lewis, Mal Meninga, Wayne Pearce, Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling and Eric Grothe, became known as The Invincibles. In 1979 the Queensland Rugby League tried to block Boustead's move to Sydney, although Eastern Suburbs ultimately gained his services. He broke his ankle in his first season in Sydney. After having played for New South Wales in 1979 under residential selection criteria, Boustead represented Queensland in the first ever State of Origin match in 1980. He scored Queensland's first ever try in State of Origin and is one of a handful of players to have scored 3 tries in an Origin game. Ironically, Boustead was initially against the State of Origin concept, believing that players should represent the state where they currently lived and played. =1980s= Boustead played in the centres in Easts' loss to Canterbury in the 1980 Grand Final. He toured with Frank Stanton's 1982 'Invincibles', playing all six tests on tour against Papua New Guinea, Great Britain and France. Boustead stayed with the Roosters till the end of 1982 and then in 1983 followed his club coach Bob Fulton to Manly-Warringah for four seasons. In the Australian off-seasons he played in the UK for Hull Kingston Rovers in 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87, including playing in the centres for Hull KR in their 46-10 loss to the 1986 Kangaroos. However leg, collarbone and shoulder injuries seriously disrupted the momentum of his career in this period. In 1986 while still at Manly he played in only seven matches of the 25 round regular season. In 1988 Boustead resumed his career with the North Sydney Bears making thirty-three appearances in his last three seasons, including playing in the Bears 1989 Reserve Grade premiership winning team,Bears vs Eels, Reserve Grade Grand Final 1989 before retiring at the end of 1990. Post-playing career In the late 1980s after a survey was conducted to gauge public support for the introduction of a North Queensland team in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership returned an overwhelming positive response, a major step was taken with the appointment of a promotions manager for the bid. Boustead was appointed to this task in 1990. He was also coaching rugby league in the Winfield State League at this time and North Queensland became the first regional side to win the competition in 1991 under Boustead.Kerry Boustead at the SportingPulse Homepage for Northern Division In 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. Boustead returned to the game as the Chief Executive of the newly promoted North Queensland Cowboys in 1995 but resigned after five competition matches when the club aligned itself with Super League. He served on the NRL Judiciary Tribunal from 1997‚Äì98 and in 2000. In February 2008, Boustead was named in the list of the Australian rugby league's 100 greatest players (1908-2007) which was commissioned by the National Rugby League and Australian Rugby League to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Surprisingly Boustead's position was usurped in the Queensland Team of the Century announced on the night of game II of the 2008 State of Origin by two wingers who were not named in the Australian 100 Greatest - Cec Aynsley and Denis Flannery. In 2009 Boustead was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

Such waste ponds may be used for regular disposal of pollutant materials or may be used as upset receivers for special pollution events. Often, chemical ponds themselves are addressed for cleanup action after their useful life is over or when a risk of groundwater contamination arises. Peak usage of waste ponds in the United States occurred in the period 1955 to 1985, after which the environmental risks of pond technology were sufficiently understood,David Crimp, Leda Patmore et al., Environmental Assessment of Kaiser Refractories Waste Pond, Moss Landing, California, Earth Metrics Inc., Santa Cruz County, California and the State of California Environmental Clearinghouse (1976) such that alternative technologies for waste disposal gradually began to displace many of the waste ponds. Waste ponds often have pond liners, such as concrete or robust synthetic polymeric materials, to prevent infiltration of chemicals to soil or groundwater. Examples =Piscataway chemical pond= One example of a chemical pond is situated in the woods of Piscataway, New Jersey. It was used by Union Carbide during the active phase of plant operation. Its main use was for drainage of chemicals. Hazardous and exotic chemicals would go down drains in the plant to the pond and later be pumped back to the factory via two large pumps. There it would be distilled to remove acetone and other hazardous chemicals from the mix. This process was overall harmful to the environment and polluted the groundwater. =Oak Ridge waste pond= The United States Oak Ridge National Laboratory operated for more than 50 years, performing research and production at its facility in the Melton Valley area of the Oak Ridge Reservation, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, before it was decommissioned in the mid 1960s. One of the results of this activity was a waste pond, which was contaminated with radioactive waste including strontium-90, caesium-137; tritium, and transuranics. During the 1970s, the pond was backfilled with clay and shale, and finally capped with asphalt. In the mid 1990s, as a temporary solution to concerns that soil and sediments could migrate into nearby streams and, ultimately, reservoirs used for recreation and drinking water supplies, Department of Energy officials installed a cryogenic stabilization system at the waste pond, freezing the soil and groundwater to a depth of approximately around the pond, thereby forming a barrier to groundwater leaching. In February 2004, the cryogenic system was dismantled, replaced with a temporary thermal foam blanket to keep the soil cold, and the pond was excavated. The soil in the areas surrounding the frozen pond contained lower levels of contamination than the pond itself, but enough contamination that it had to be removed. Approximately of soil were removed from the surrounding areas. Another of soil were excavated from the pond itself.Gwenyth Laird Pernie, Crew Takes on Chemical Pond, Construction Equipment Guide (2005) See also *Evaporation ponds *Waste stabilization pond References Environmental technology Ponds Water pollution ","title":"Waste pond"},{"id":"9742723","title":"List of Evil Dead characters"},{"id":"9742733","text":"thumb Founded in 1995, Kujtesa started out as a small business that offered a range of IT services, from backing up CDs to computer sales and repairs.

Early life Duff was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland and attended Portora Royal School (now Enniskillen Royal Grammar School), which is located in the town. Career Duff served as an officer in the British Merchant Navy in World War I and then in the intelligence division of the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service. He resigned from the Foreign Office in the 1930s, claiming it was solidly supportive of fascism in Spain and ready to back a similar system in Britain. Languages After he retired, Duff taught linguistics and languages in London and Singapore, while writing travel guides, histories, satires, and a series of text books for the active self-learner. He was fluent in seven languages. His many translations included works by Francisco de Quevedo, √âmile Zola, B. Traven, Maxim Gorky, and Arnold Zweig. Duff's best known book is A Handbook of Hanging. This also covers electrocution, decapitations, gassings, innocent men executed and botched executions.

In describing Joyce, Duff draws on ethnic stereotypes, describing Irish people as motivated by \\"a restless and often fantastic imagination\\". Joyce himself owned a copy of Duff's book, and the literary scholar Jean-Michel Rabat√© argues that, when Joyce came to complete Finnegans Wake (1939), he was pleased with Duff's book and incorporated elements of Duff's thought into his work, including the vindication of the rights of the \\"plain reader\\".

Nautical tourism, also called water tourism, is tourism that combines sailing and boating with vacation and holiday activities. It can be travelling from port to port in a cruise ship, or joining boat-centered events such as regattas or landing a small boat for lunch or other day recreation at specially prepared day boat- landings. It is a form of tourism that is generally more popular in the summertime. First defined as an industry segment in Europe and South America, it has since caught on in the United States and the Pacific Rim.  About  Many tourists who enjoy sailing combine water travel with other activities. Supplying the equipment and accessories for those activities has spawned businesses for those purposes.See, Natchez, Dan, Nautical Tourism: Great for the Boater and a Revenue Center Card, online at http://www.dsnainc.com/Syndicated%20Column/PDFs/Nautical%20Tourism.pdf With many nautical enthusiasts living on board their vessels even in port, nautical tourists bring demand for a variety of goods and services. Marinas developed especially for nautical tourists have been built in Europe, South America and Australia.  Services  Tourist services available at marinas catering to nautical tourists include: * Leasing of berths for sailing vessels and nautical tourists who live on board. * Leasing of sailing vessels for holiday and recreational use (charter, cruising and similar), * Reception, safe- guarding and maintenance of sailing vessels. * Provision of stock (water, fuel, supplies, spare parts, equipment and similar). * Preparation and keeping sailing vessels in order. * Providing information to nautical enthusiasts (weather forecasts, nautical guides etc.) * Leasing of water scooters, jet skis, and other water equipment.

Italy has gone to great lengths to attract boating tourists to its ports as well.See, http://www.italy- yachtcharter.com/nautical.asp  The Netherlands  Rowing water tourists in Hillegomin April, when the tulip fields are in bloom. Water travel used to be the only form of transportation between cities in the Netherlands. Since improvements in the road and rail structure, less and less commercial freight water traffic is using the water. In the latter half of the 20th century the growth of water tourism exceeded the amount of freight traffic, and older cities whose ports were long disused refurbished them for water tourists. Water tourists are a strong lobby for protecting old water routes from being closed or filled. Both refurnished antique canal boats (\\"salonboten\\") and modern tour boats (\\"rondvaartboten\\") are available for tourist day trips in most Dutch cities. A steady tourist industry has kept both the old canals of Amsterdam and their canal mansions open for water traffic. Their popularity has introduced water traffic safety laws to ensure that the commercial passenger boats have right-of-way over private skiffs and low yachts, while preventing fatal accidents.Pleziervaart in beeld report by the Ministry of Culture on watertourist safety To reduce the less desired side-effects of popular watertourist spots, the public awards stimulate sustainable tourist innovations, such as the EDEN award for the electricity-propelled tourist boats in De Weerribben-Wieden National Park.2010 EDEN award  Czech Republic  Water tourists on the Vltava river in Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod. River tourism is exceptionally popular among the Czech people, who sail by canoes, rafts or other boats downstream major Bohemian rivers as Vltava, S√°zava or Lu≈ænice. The most popular and frequented river section is the Vltava from Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod via ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov to Bor≈°ov nad Vltavou, which is visited by as many as hundreds of thousands paddlers (in Czech called \\"vod√°ci\\", sg. \\"vod√°k\\") a year. In peak season, \\"traffic jams\\" can be regularly seen on the busiest rivers, mainly at weirs. There has even some \\"paddlers' culture\\" developed, with peculiar slang, songs, traditions etc., related to the Czech tramping movement. = The Pacific = Australia has invested $1.5 billion in facilities designed to attract nautical tourists and promote development of nautical tourism as a segment of the tourist trade.See, Shell Harbour article on line at http://nauticaltourism.com/ In 2016/17 saw the industry‚Äôs total national economic contribution in Australia grow by 15.4% and contributed A$5.3 billion to the Australian economy. Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne accounted for 65% of the total passenger onshore visit days. A cruiser is seen docked at a harbour along the Yarra River, Melbourne, Australia. Compared to 56 cruise ships that arrived in 2011/12, 85 cruise ships visited Melbourne in 2015/16 and the city authority planned a holistic approach to accommodate the surge in nautical tourism. = South America = A growing worldwide industry segment, nautical tourism has become popular in South America.

In the Southeast, the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a meandering river and canal system that traverses Alabama and Mississippi linking the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico, has become a favorite boating trail for nautical tourists who want a diverse route with a scenic view.See, the official Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway tourisim website online at http://tenntom.sam.usace.army.mil/Recreation.html Originally conceived as an alternate shipping route for barges destined for the Midwest, the route proved too awkward for large tows. However, boating enthusiasts discovered it as a great way to see Middle-America. Stops along the way include Mobile, Alabama, Demopolis, Alabama, and Amory and Columbus in Mississippi. Travelling north from the Gulf, boaters can follow the Tennessee River its intersection with the Ohio and travel a circuitous route back to the Gulf by way of New Orleans. Likewise, the Intracoastal Waterway system, which stretches from Texas to New Jersey, has long provided nautical tourists with a well-marked channel and an inside passage that allows boaters to travel from southern Texas up the eastern seaboard without having to venture onto the high seas.See official website for the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway online at http://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Technical%20Services/Operations%20Branch/atlantic%20intercoastal%20waterway/homepage.asp Using this route, boaters can stop at Galveston, Texas, any number of towns in southern Louisiana, including New Orleans.

It is just over five miles south of Holyhead and is the most southerly settlement on the island. The name Rhoscolyn is said to mean \\"The Moor\\" (Rhos) of The Column (colyn), referring to a pillar which the Romans put up to mark the edge of their territories. The community population taken from the 2011 census was 542. The community includes the larger part of the village of Four Mile Bridge, which extends into the community of Valley on the other side of the Cymyran Strait. A little to the west of the village is a mediaeval well dedicated to St Gwenfaen beside which are the remains of a drystone well house measuring 4.5 m east-west by 5.5 m. The local church in the village itself is dedicated to the same saint and was first built in the 6th century.Hughes, Margaret: Anglesey from the Sea, page 43, Carreg Gwalch, 2001 The present church was built in 1875 and enlarged by the addition of a chancel in 1879. See also Wikipedia entry St Gwenfaen's Church, Rhoscolyn Among the interior fittings is a fine copper memorial in Art Nouveau style to the Revd. John Hopkins, who was Rector from 1876 until his death in 1901. Hopkins was obviously an effective and well-loved priest. There exists a 10,000 word appreciation of Hopkins written by \\"His Honour Judge Parry\\", a summer visitor who got to know him well. This includes many fascinating anecdotes illustrating the nature of rural life in late nineteenth century Anglesey. Rhoscolyn is bordered to the south by a small enclosed bay called Borthwen which is bordered by a public beach. There was once a lifeboat station on Borthwen which was open between 1830 and 1929 which has been replaced by a navigational beacon on Ynysoedd Gwylanod ('Gulls' Islands'). Around these waters at the end of the 18th century was a thriving oyster catching industry, but this declined once the beds had been depleted.Hughes, Margaret: Anglesey from the Sea, page 44, Carreg Gwalch, 2001 Existing buildings include the local pub, The White Eagle, reportedly a favourite of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and the Ysgol Gynradd Santes Gwenfaen primary school which is found just over a mile north of the village. Probably the most significant lifeboat incident here was the launch to the Timbo. On 1 December 1920 the small coaster, was en route to Ireland from Holyhead when she was overcome by a storm off South Stack and began to drift down the coast. The lifeboat was launched, with great difficulty in the heavy seas, and made a number of attempts to get a line aboard her, without success, until the cox decided no more could be done and the lifeboat started its return journey, from a point close to Ynys Llanddwyn. The lifeboat capsized and 5 of the 13 man crew were lost, and, a little later, 4 men from the Timbo as well. The ship eventually became stranded at Dinas Dinlle, was eventually refloated with the use of tugs until she struck Carreg y Trai reef off Abersoch and was lost.

History In 1833, the parish population was 231, mostly employed in agriculture. Much of the parish and almost all the medieval village except the church was cleared during the establishment of the BP oil terminal southwest of the village in 1961 and during the construction of the Texaco Pembroke Refinery immediately to the north in 1964.

In 2018, Bryan Cave merged with Berwin Leighton Painser to create Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, led by Lisa Mayhew and Therese Pritchard. History BLP's roots lie in the early twentieth century, when the three original law firms were founded: # Paisner & Co was established in 1932 by Leslie Paisner and provided general legal advice. # Lionel Leighton established Leighton & Co in 1942, a firm that advised on litigation and property development. # Berwin & Co was founded in 1963 by Stanley Berwin, specialising in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and tax. In 1970, Leighton & Co and Berwin & Co merged to form Berwin Leighton and moved into Adelaide House, London. Berwin Leighton Paisner was formed on 1 May 2001 when the two firms merged, comprising a total of nearly 1000 staff, with 122 partners. The agreement to merge was heralded by a steel band and balloons in the office foyer, following 8 months of negotiations. The new firm's London headquarters continued to be Adelaide House. Neville Eisenberg was elected managing partner of Berwin Leighton in 1999, and held the same position in BLP until May 2015. when Lisa Mayhew was elected managing partner. 2009 saw the formation of Goltsblat BLP, a 70-strong team that is the only joint venture between an international and local firm in Russia.

For instance, if Person X is known for exposing secrets in an organization, the organization leaders announce that \\"any members who have dirty talking habits will be dealt with\\" to warn Person X. It refers to the ancient Greek fabulist Aesop. The term \\"Aesopian language\\" was first used by the nineteenth-century Russian writer Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin to describe the writing technique he began using late in his career, which he compared to Aesop's Fables. His purpose was to satirize the social ills of the time but evade the harsh censorship of the late Tsarist Russia of which he was a particular target.Prozorov, V.V. (1990). \\"–ú.–ï.Saltykov-Shchedrin\\". Russian Writers. Biobibliographical Dictionary. Vol 2. Ed. P.A.Nikolayev. Moscow, \\"Prosveshcheniye\\" Publishers. The Soviet-era writer Lev Loseff noted that the use of Aesopian language remained a favorite technique of writers (including himself) under Soviet censorship.Lev Loseff, On the Beneficence of Censorship: Aesopian Language in Modern Russian Literature, Munich: Otto Sagner, 1984. Maliheh Tyrell defines the term in the Soviet context and observes that the use of Aesopian language extended to other national literatures under Soviet rule: > In short, this form of literature, like Aesop's animal fables, veils itself > in allegorical suggestions, hints, and euphemisms so as to elude political > censorship. 'Aesopian language' or literature is a technical term used by > Sovietologists to define allegorical language used by Russian or nationality > [that is: non-Russian] nonconformist publicists to conceal antiregime > sentiments. Under Soviet rule, this 'Aesopian' literature intended to > confuse the Soviet authorities, yet illuminate the truth for native readers. According to one critic, \\"Censorship... had a positive, formative impact upon the Aesopian writers' style by obliging them to sharpen their thoughts.\\"Harry B. Weber, ed., The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet Literature, Gulf Breeze, FL: Academic International Press, 1977. The German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse uses the term in his book One-Dimensional Man somewhat interchangeably with Orwellian language.see H. Marcuse, \\"One- Dimensional Man\\". Beacon Press, Boston. 1991 (1964) p. 98 In that context, \\"Aesopian Language\\" refers to the idea that certain usages of language work to 'suppress certain concepts or keep them out of the general discourse within society'. An example of such a technique is the use of abbreviations to possibly prevent undesirable questions from arising: \\"AFL-CIO entombs the radical political differences which once separated the two organizations.\\" Within the context of politics, a term with a very similar meaning is called dog-whistle politics, which describes the use of coded language to address voters' interests. Certain sections of the electorate will react strongly to controversial content if spoken of overtly but may not be so attuned that they notice statements that appear neutral to outsiders.

Often values and expressions that are less popular among social conservatives, such as LGBT equality, the anti-war movement, or secular values generally, are invoked by users to frame their argument. The same values form the foundation of what is known as West Coast liberalism, though the political cultures of Los Angeles (and notably Hollywood therein), Seattle, et cetera also contribute to this concept. This term, however, is not necessarily pejorative. For example, a liberal may identify as a \\"West Coast liberal\\" to distinguish himself/herself from other similar ideologies (i.e. East Coast liberalism) or to emphasize the issues which are most important to them. Meaning \\"San Francisco values\\" is used in a pejorative sense by conservative commentators to describe a secular progressive culture commonly associated with the city of San Francisco. The term has been associated with same-sex marriage, high minimum wages, anti-war activism, pro-choice politics, marijuana decriminalization, and free migration. Media usage The term \\"San Francisco values\\" was used by conservative pundits during the conservative movement of the mid-1990s, and has since been popularized by Bill O'Reilly and Newt Gingrich. It is possibly a successor to then-Democrat Jeane Kirkpatrick's condemnation of \\"San Francisco Democrats\\" for a \\"blame America first\\" mentality at the 1984 Republican National Convention (the Democrats had just held their convention in San Francisco). While O'Reilly claimed to have coined the term,Bill O'Reilly: Here Comes the Left. November 22, 2006. it dates back at least to 1996, when Rep. Frank Riggs attacked his Democratic rival Michela Alioto over her \\"San Francisco values.\\"Roll Call, July 18, 1996: \\"Riggs questioned whether Alioto's opposition to the bill to ban federal recognition of same-sex marriage represented 'North Coast values' or 'San Francisco values.'\\" With the ascendancy of San Francisco representative Nancy Pelosi to Speaker of the House, the term experienced a surge in popularity following the 2006 midterm elections. Newt Gingrich, for example, sent a fundraising letter to supporters, saying, \\"Will everything you've worked so hard to accomplish be lost to the San Francisco values of would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi?\\" Meanwhile, the Augusta Chronicle, a Georgia newspaper, warned readers that \\"Pelosi will be speaker and her far-left San Francisco values -- gay marriage, cutting and running from Iraq, coddling terrorists, raising taxes, amnesty for illegals -- will become the House agenda.\\" In addition to being used by some right-wing pundits, the term has appeared in and around San Francisco itself. The San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco's largest daily newspaper, discussed the term in its 2006 article, \\"Three Dirty Words: San Francisco Values.\\" The next week, the San Francisco Bay Guardian responded with a similarly titled article, \\"San Francisco Values,\\" calling the Chronicle's editorial positions into question. Congressman Sam Graves defeated challenger Kay Barnes in the 2008 election after airing two television ads.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROhNSsi79E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4PGUq3yiw4 The first ad, dubbed \\"San Francisco Values,\\" made use of a Barnes fundraising trip to U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi's California district. It featured a black man in a cowboy hat dancing in a bar with two women - one white, one black. The script suggested that Barnes, among other liberal sins, favored \\"abortion on demand.\\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston- texas/houston/article/Cruz-consultant-Jeff-Roe-thrives-in-the-school- of-6236892.php Positive usage The Peter B. Collins Show, a syndicated liberal talk show no longer on the air, billed itself as a talk show \\"infused with dangerous 'San Francisco values' like compassion, justice, and a living wage\\". San Francisco State University, the only public undergraduate university in San Francisco, California, in the absence of high profile sports and traditional collegiate greek life demonstrates a unique school spirit steeped in San Francisco values. Every graduate must complete the SF state studies component of their bachelor's degree that requires coursework in American ethnic and racial minorities, environmental sustainability, global perspectives and social justice. This broad-based progressive education is the university response to student activism going back more than 50 years, most notably with the Third World Liberation Front strikes of 1968, that resulted in the very first program and only College of Ethnic Studies. In this way, San Francisco values are really the spirit demonstrated in the daily lives of students from San Francisco state and perpetuates and develops these values in the greater community. This creates an institutional basis for San Francisco values.

During his playing career, he stood 5'11\\" (180 cm) tall, weighed 180 pounds (82 kg), batted left-handed, and threw right-handed. Playing career Born in Granite Quarry, North Carolina, Benson attended Catawba College in nearby Salisbury. He debuted in the Majors with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1943 and had a second trial with the Mackmen in 1946, but most of his career would be spent in the organization of the St. Louis Cardinals. While he appeared in only 46 games for St. Louis between 1951‚Äì53, he was a fixture with the Cards' Rochester Red Wings and Columbus Red Birds Triple-A farm clubs as a player. Overall, Benson batted .202 in 104 MLB at bats over five seasons, with three home runs and 12 runs batted in. In his finest minor league season, 1951 at Columbus, he batted .308 with 18 home runs and 89 RBI. He became a manager in the Redbird system in 1956 with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Class C Northern League. On July 6, 1961, he was promoted from manager of the Triple-A Portland Beavers to the Cardinals to serve as a Major League coach under new skipper Johnny Keane. Major League coach Benson worked with Keane through the Cards' 1964 World Championship, then moved to the New York Yankees when Keane switched to the Bombers (his 1964 World Series opponent) in 1965. But the Yankees were in a downward spiral at the time, finishing sixth in the '65 American League race. Then they won only four of their first 20 games in 1966, resulting in Keane's firing and Benson's resignation on May 7. Two months later, on July 13, 1966, Benson returned to the National League as a coach for fellow North Carolinian Dave Bristol, newly appointed pilot of the Cincinnati Reds. He spent the remainder of his MLB career in the Senior Circuit, as a coach for the Reds (through 1969), the Cardinals again (1970 through 1975), Atlanta Braves (1976‚Äì77), and San Francisco Giants (1980), working in the latter two posts under Bristol once again. He managed the Syracuse Chiefs, Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, in 1978‚Äì79. He won three playoff championships in the minor leagues, in: the Northern League (with Winnipeg) in 1957; the Texas League (with Tulsa) in 1960; and the International League (with Syracuse) in 1979. After his on-field career ended, Benson returned to the Cardinals as a scout. He also managed the Braves for one game in under unusual circumstances. After the club lost 21 of its first 29 games, Dave Bristol was sent on a \\"scouting trip\\" on May 10 and replaced by the team's owner, Ted Turner, a world-class yachtsman and television executive who had no baseball experience. After Turner lost his only game as the team's skipper on the 11th, National League president Chub Feeney told Turner that managers cannot own financial interest in a club. When Turner's appeal to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was turned down, Benson stepped in for one game‚Äîwhich he won, 6‚Äì1 over the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 12‚Äîbefore Bristol was rehired for the remainder of the season.

It should not to be confused with the tributary system.Liu, p. 51-55 The term \\"Jimi\\" was first seen in the annotation of Shiji quoted by Sima Zhen from a book of Eastern Han era, which implied to a man directing a horse or ox by the use of rein.Yuan et al., p. 101 Jimi administrative divisions were used primarily during the Tang dynasty from the 650s until the 740s.Liu, p. 48-49 It was subsequently used in the Song, Mongol Yuan, Ming dynasties under other names such as the Tusi system () until around 1726, when a new civil order under the Qing government was established.Zhang, p. 63-67, 108-113 Characteristics The system was a model of Chinese administrative units established for foreign rulers or chiefs that were either militarily subdued or self-subdued and naturalized. They received their duty from central authority while keeping their original status, and passed on their duty to heirs.Liu, p. 17‚Äì23 They were to provide annual tribute, following the foreign policy and superintend by the central authority. In terms of foreign policy, they would collaborate with the officials sent by the central authority in administration, participate in military affairs of central authority's interest, and obey the assignation made by the central authority.Liu, p. 38‚Äì43, 56‚Äì59 The system was first introduced by commander Li Daliang between August 23 and September 25, 630.Liu, p. 8 It mainly consisted of three levels: the command area (), prefecture () and county (). Known collectively as Jimifuzhou or the loose-control administrative units, they were not commonly confused with Zhengzhou () or the regular administrative units. In additions, there were also two loose-control protectorates (duhufu ÈÉΩË≠∑Â∫ú) established in the former Western Turkic Khaganate at around the Tarbagatai Mountains and Lake Balkhash in 658, the only loose-control protectorates ever established.Liu, p. 18, 120-123Tian, p. 508 In some cases, a moderate number of loose-control counties were also established under the jurisdiction of a regular prefecture at the border of Tang proper. The loose-control administrative units, specifically the command area and prefecture, were established shortly after a region, state or tribe was subdued and formed as a political division within the extent of a separated regular protectorate.Liu, p. 31‚Äì38 They were established in the area of today's northern Hebei, northern Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Siberia, Sogdiana and Afghanistan to the north and west, Hunan and Guangxi to the south, western Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan to the southwest, where they co-existed with the regular prefecture, and also parts of Inner and Central Asia during the early Tang empire.Liu, 145‚Äì234 Until 755, there were approximately 1,000 or around 856 loose-control prefectures established within the former khaganate and state, about 2.6 times the regular prefecture.Liu, p. 29 See also * Fanzhen * Fengjian * Jiedushi * Tusi Notes References *Zhou, Weiyan, \\"Jimizhou\\".
