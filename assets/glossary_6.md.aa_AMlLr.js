Six oxygen atoms surround the central ruthenium atom in an octahedral arrangement. The average Ru-O bond length in Ru(acac)3 is 2.00 √Ö. Because Ru(acac)3 is low spin, there is one unpaired d electron, causing this compound to be paramagnetic.

It has feather palm pinnate leaves that arch inwards towards a thick stout trunk. Palms cultivated around the world under the name Butia capitata are actually almost all B. odorata. The real B. capitata is not notably hardy, nor widely cultivated. In Minas Gerais it flowers from May to July and is in fruit from November to February. Ripe fruit are about the size of large cherry, and yellowish/orange in color, but can also include a blush towards the tip. Taxonomy This taxon was first scientifically described in 1826 as Cocos capitata in the Historia Naturalis Palmarum by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, who described and illustrated the palm from sketches and herbarium collections he made on montane grasslands near the Serra de Santo Ant√¥nio, Minas Gerais. In 1970 Sidney Fredrick Glassman moved this species, along with all other Butia, to Syagrus, but in 1979 he changed his mind and moved everything back. Uses The fruits are locally harvested from the wild between November and February to make juices, liquor, marmalades and ice- cream. The fruit has orange, sometimes red, skin. The pulp is bright orange, highly aromatic, somewhat oily, and quite fibrous. The pulp can be frozen for industrial production. In the north of Minas Gerais state B. capitata juice has been added to some public school lunches. An oil can be extracted from the nuts which is quite similar to coconut oil. Nutrition The pulp is a good source of Œ≤-carotene and provitamin A compared with other fruits usually consumed. A glass of juice containing 100g of B. capitata pulp can provide 40% of the daily vitamin A requirements for children aged under eight by the standards of the National Academy of Medicine.

Tidwell is a retired American basketball player and medical doctor. He played for the University of Michigan from 1958 to 1961 and broke the school's records for points scored in a single game and single season. He later became an obstetrician-gynecologist in Charlotte, North Carolina. Biography =Early years= Tidwell grew up in Herrin in southern Illinois. He played basketball for Herrin High School from 1955 to 1957, leading the school to a 28-3 record as a junior and 31-2 as a senior. In 1957, the 6 feet, 4 inch Tidwell was the tallest player and the high scorer for the Herrin High School team that won the Illinois state basketball championship. Herrin defeated Elgin in the quarter-finals, Quincy Notre Dame in the semi-finals, and Collinsville in the championship game. The 1957 state championship was considered a great feat because Herrin was a relatively small city, and Illinois had only one class in basketball. Tidwell was also selected as a first-team forward on the 1957 Illinois All-State basketball team. =Michigan= Tidwell was one of the most highly rated high school basketball players in the Midwest in 1957. He reportedly received scholarships from 70 colleges, including the University of Illinois and University of Michigan. Michigan's head coach Bill Perigo did not travel to Herrin to recruit Tidwell, but Tidwell chose Michigan because of its good engineering school. He played college basketball for the University of Michigan from 1958-1961\\\\. Tidwell managed to excel in basketball game despite what the Chicago Daily Tribune described as \\"the handicap of a short and twisted left arm.\\" Tidwell sustained the injury while playing quarterback for the freshman football team while in high school in 1953. He dislocated his left elbow when his arm was pinned behind his back on being tackled. He had a pin placed in his elbow. Tidwell later recalled how the injury had affected his jump shot: > \\"I never could get full range of motion back. ... When taking a right-handed > jump shot, it was unorthodox. It was an unusual shot, because I couldn't > straighten my left arm. I ended up shooting it from lesser height, bending > my right arm more to compensate for my left arm. The right elbow was out. It > was a different shot. But I shot it effectively.\\" As a sophomore, Tidwell made a name for himself in his first varsity basketball game for Michigan. Tidwell was matched up against University of Pittsburgh All-American Don Hennon and scored 22 points in his debut. He followed with 24 points in his second collegiate game against the University of Tennessee and another 24 points the following week against Butler. He also led the Wolverines with 22 points in a 93-68 win over the University of Detroit in the Motor City Classic. His play helped lead Michigan to a 6-1 start in 1958, and he was credited with having \\"created an upsurge of interest in basketball at Michigan.\\" After his first seven games, sports writer Jerry Green called Tidwell \\"the most exciting cager to arrive at Michigan in years.\\" Green noted that Tidwell \\"floats quietly around the court, shooting sure- handedly, making deft passes, piling up points.\\" In December 1958, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported, \\"One of the big ones from Illinois got away last year -- and turned up on the Ann Arbor campus of the University of Michigan.\\" Michigan's coach Perigo noted, \\"He's so smooth and steady out there you don't notice him until he comes out.\\" As a junior during the 1959-1960 academic year, Tidwell broke the Michigan record for single game scoring record on February 27, 1960, as he hit 17 of 25 field goals and seven of ten free throws for 41 points in a 72-65 win against Michigan State. Tidwell's 41 points also broke the Yost Field House record which had been set by Indiana's Don Schlundt with 29 points in 1953. Tidwell also broke the season scoring record as a junior with 520 points‚Äîan average of 21.6 points per game. At the end of the 1959-1960 basketball season, Tidwell was selected as the team's most valuable player and elected captain of the 1960-1961 team. As the senior captain of the 1960-1961 Michigan basketball team, Tidwell suffered a mid-season slump in February 1961, but still finished the season with 441 points and an average 19.2 points per game. On March 4, 1961, he broke his own single game scoring record with 43 points against the University of Minnesota. Two days later, on March 6, 1961, Tidwell scored 24 points against Illinois in his final home game for Michigan. When he left the game, he was given a three-minute standing ovation by the spectators at Yost Field House. At the end of the season, he was selected by his teammates as the team's most valuable player for the second consecutive year. During his three years playing for the Wolverines, Tidwell scored 1,386 points. At the conclusion of his Michigan basketball career, head coach Dave Strack called Tidwell \\"one of the finest collegiate basketball players in the nation.\\" Tidwell was drafted by the Philadelphia Warriors in the fourth round (38th overall pick) of the 1961 NBA draft, but he chose instead to attend medical school. =Medical career= After graduating from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1965, Tidwell spent a year as an intern at the University of Maryland Hospital and four years as a resident at the University of Michigan. After two years in the U.S. Army, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where he began practicing as on obstetrician-gynecologist.

This formula is given in his treatise titled Mahabhaskariya. It is not known how Bhaskara I arrived at his approximation formula. However, several historians of mathematics have put forward different hypotheses as to the method Bhaskara might have used to arrive at his formula. The formula is elegant, simple and enables one to compute reasonably accurate values of trigonometric sines without using any geometry whatsoever. The approximation formula The formula is given in verses 17 - 19, Chapter VII, Mahabhaskariya of Bhaskara I. A translation of the verses is given below: *(Now) I briefly state the rule (for finding the bhujaphala and the kotiphala, etc.) without making use of the Rsine-differences 225, etc. Subtract the degrees of a bhuja (or koti) from the degrees of a half circle (that is, 180 degrees). Then multiply the remainder by the degrees of the bhuja or koti and put down the result at two places. At one place subtract the result from 40500. By one-fourth of the remainder (thus obtained), divide the result at the other place as multiplied by the 'anthyaphala (that is, the epicyclic radius). Thus is obtained the entire bahuphala (or, kotiphala) for the sun, moon or the star-planets. So also are obtained the direct and inverse Rsines. (The reference \\"Rsine-differences 225\\" is an allusion to Aryabhata's sine table.) In modern mathematical notations, for an angle x in degrees, this formula gives : \\\\sin x^\\\\circ \\\\approx \\\\frac{4 x (180-x)}{40500 - x(180-x)} =Equivalent forms of the formula= Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula can be expressed using the radian measure of angles as follows. :\\\\sin x \\\\approx \\\\frac{16x (\\\\pi - x)}{5\\\\pi^2 - 4x (\\\\pi - x)}. For a positive integer n this takes the following form: (p.60) : \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{n} \\\\approx \\\\frac{16(n-1)}{5n^2-4n+4}. The formula acquires an even simpler form when expressed in terms of the cosine rather than the sine. Using radian measure for angle, and putting x = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\pi + y, one gets : \\\\cos y \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 - 4 y^2}{\\\\pi^2 + y^2}. The assonance of \\"\\\\pi\\" and \\"y\\" makes this expression especially pleasing as a mnemonic. To express the previous formula with the constant \\\\tau=2\\\\pi one can use\\\\cos y\\\\approx 1-\\\\frac{20y^2}{4y^2+\\\\tau^2} Equivalent forms of Bhaskara I's formula have been given by almost all subsequent astronomers and mathematicians of India. For example, Brahmagupta's (598 - 668 CE) Brhma-Sphuta-Siddhanta (verses 23 - 24, Chapter XIV) gives the formula in the following form: : R \\\\sin x^\\\\circ \\\\approx \\\\frac{R x(180-x)}{10125 - \\\\frac{1}{4}x(180-x)} Also, Bhaskara II (1114 - 1185 CE) has given this formula in his Lilavati (Kshetra-vyavahara, Soka No.48) in the following form: : 2R\\\\sin x^\\\\circ \\\\approx \\\\frac{4\\\\times 2R \\\\times 2Rx\\\\times (360R - 2Rx)}{\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\times 5 \\\\times (360R)^2 - 2Rx\\\\times (360R -2Rx)} Accuracy of the formula Figure illustrates the level of accuracy of the Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula. The shifted curves 4 x ( 180 - x ) / ( 40500 - x ( 180 - x ) ) - 0.2 and sin ( x ) + 0.2 look like exact copies of the curve sin ( x ). The formula is applicable for values of x¬∞ in the range from 0 to 180. The formula is remarkably accurate in this range. The graphs of sin ( x ) and the approximation formula are indistinguishable and are nearly identical. One of the accompanying figures gives the graph of the error function, namely the function, : \\\\sin x^\\\\circ \\\\approx \\\\frac{4 x (180-x)}{40500 - x(180-x)} in using the formula. It shows that the maximum absolute error in using the formula is around 0.0016. From a plot of the percentage value of the absolute error, it is clear that the maximum percentage error is less than 1.8. The approximation formula thus gives sufficiently accurate values of sines for most practical purposes. However it was not sufficient for the more accurate computational requirements of astronomy. The search for more accurate formulas by Indian astronomers eventually led to the discovery the power series expansions of sin x and cos x by Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1350 ‚Äì c. 1425), the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. Graph of the error in Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula Graph of the percentage error in Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula Derivation of the formula Bhaskara I had not indicated any method by which he arrived at his formula. Historians have speculated on various possibilities. No definitive answers have as yet been obtained. Beyond its historical importance of being a prime example of the mathematical achievements of ancient Indian astronomers, the formula is of significance from a modern perspective also. Mathematicians have attempted to derive the rule using modern concepts and tools. Around half a dozen methods have been suggested, each based on a separate set of premises. (p.104) Most of these derivations use only elementary concepts. =Derivation based on elementary geometry = Let the circumference of a circle be measured in degrees and let the radius R of the circle be also measured in degrees. Choosing a fixed diameter AB and an arbitrary point P on the circle and dropping the perpendicular PM to AB, we can compute the area of the triangle APB in two ways. Equating the two expressions for the area one gets (1/2) AB √ó PM = (1/2) AP √ó BP. This gives : \\\\frac{1}{PM} = \\\\frac{AB}{AP \\\\times BP}. Letting x be the length of the arc AP, the length of the arc BP is 180 - x. These arcs are much bigger than the respective chords. Hence one gets :\\\\frac{1}{PM} > \\\\frac{2R}{x(180-x)}. One now seeks two constants Œ± and Œ≤ such that : \\\\frac{1}{PM} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{2R}{x(180-x)} + \\\\beta It is indeed not possible to obtain such constants. However one may choose values for Œ± and Œ≤ so that the above expression is valid for two chosen values of the arc length x. Choosing 30¬∞ and 90¬∞ as these values and solving the resulting equations, one immediately gets Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula. =Derivation starting with a general rational expression= Assuming that x is in radians, one may seek an approximation to sin (x) in the following form: : \\\\sin x \\\\approx \\\\frac{a+bx+cx^2}{p+qx+rx^2} The constants a, b, c, p, q and r (only five of them are independent) can be determined by assuming that the formula must be exactly valid when x = 0, œÄ/6, œÄ/2, œÄ, and further assuming that it has to satisfy the property that sin (x) = sin (œÄ - x). This procedure produces the formula expressed using radian measure of angles. =An elementary argument= Comparison of graphs of the parabolas x(180 ‚àí x)/8100 and x(180 ‚àí x)/9000 with the graph of sin(x) (x in degrees). The part of the graph of sin(x) in the range from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞ \\"looks like\\" part of a parabola through the points (0, 0) and (180, 0). The general such parabola is :k x ( 180 - x ). The parabola that also passes through (90, 1) (which is the point corresponding to the value sin(90¬∞) = 1) is :\\\\frac{x ( 180 - x )}{ 90 \\\\times 90} = \\\\frac{x ( 180 - x )}{ 8100}. The parabola which also passes through (30, 1/2) (which is the point corresponding to the value sin(30¬∞) = 1/2) is :\\\\frac{x ( 180 - x )}{2 \\\\times 30 \\\\times 150} = \\\\frac{x(180-x)}{9000}. These expressions suggest a varying denominator which takes the value 90 √ó 90 when x = 90 and the value 2 √ó 30 √ó 150 when x = 30\\\\. That this expression should also be symmetrical about the line ' x = 90' rules out the possibility of choosing a linear expression in x. Computations involving x(180 ‚àí x) might immediately suggest that the expression could be of the form :8100a + bx ( 180 - x ). A little experimentation (or by setting up and solving two linear equations in a and b) will yield the values a = 5/4, b = ‚àí1/4. These give Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula.

In 1959 it was listed on the Sydney Stock Market as a public company. As well as acquiring further concreting businesses, it diversified into building materials products. In 1961, Pioneer purchased a pre-mix concrete plant in Hong Kong. In 1962, it commenced operations in the United Kingdom, followed in 1963 by Israel and 1964 by Italy. In 1965, it formed a joint venture with Shell Australia to enter the asphalt manufacture and supply industry. In the same year, the company diversified into aggregate quarrying in Hong Kong. In 1967, Pioneer acquired FW Williams Holdings that had plastic manufacturing operations and tea and coffee plantations in Papua New Guinea.Pioneer Concrete lifts bid for FW Williams Canberra Times 8 October 1966 page 14 Pioneer Concrete Logo - Common Rendition In 1970, Pioneer acquired pre-mix and quarrying companies in Spain and by the middle of the decade the company's interests had spread to Asia, Africa, and most of Europe. In 1973, in partnership with CSR Limited, Pioneer acquired Australian & Kandos Cement Holdings. In 1975, Pioneer diversified to invest heavily in resources in a joint project with Pennzoil. In 1978, Pioneer became involved in a major coal coking and steaming development in the Hunter Valley area of New South Wales in a joint venture with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales and Ampol.

Football career Thomas was born in Swindon, Wiltshire where he became an apprentice engineer with British Rail at the Swindon Works. Whilst playing for the works team, he caught the eye of a scout from Southampton of the Football League Second Division, joining them as an amateur in 1949. He made his reserve team debut on 17 December 1949, displacing Len Stansbridge, and over the next year, he and Stansbridge vied for the role of second choice 'keeper behind Scottish international Ian Black. Black moved to Fulham in July 1950, with Northern Irish international Hugh Kelly joining the Saints in exchange. On 7 October 1950, Kelly was called into the Northern Irish team for a match against England and manager Sid Cann promoted Thomas to the first-team for a match against Birmingham City. At a month before his 18th birthday, Thomas thus became Southampton's youngest-ever first-team goalkeeper, until the debut of Bob Charles in 1959. Although the match was lost 2‚Äì0, Thomas was not deemed to be at fault for either of the goals. Thomas briefly became the second-choice 'keeper for the first eleven, making four further appearances before Christmas, but the signing of John Christie in January 1951 relegated him back to the reserves. Thomas was signed as a professional in May 1951, having gained three England Youth caps. In September 1951, Thomas was recalled to the first-team following a poor match by Christie, but after three matches Stansbridge took over until the arrival of Fred Kiernan in October. By November, Thomas has also lost his place in the reserves to Stansbridge and, unable to regain his place, he was released in the summer of 1953. Later career Although he turned out for Salisbury in 1956, Thomas was unable to continue his professional career. He later represented Wiltshire at water polo.

It was discovered on 2 March 1992, by Japanese amateur astronomers Tetsuya Fujii and Kazuro Watanabe at the Kitami Observatory in eastern Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. The asteroid was later named after Japanese astronomer Tomohiko Sekiguch.  Orbit and classification  Sekiguchi is a member the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family of the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,887 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 9¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at Goethe Link Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 42 years prior to its discovery.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Japanese astronomer Tomohiko Sekiguch (born 1970), associate professor at Hokkaido University. From 1998 to 2001, he had been observing minor planets at the European Southern Observatory. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 6 April 2012 ().  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In October 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Sekiguchi was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomers Ren√© Roy and Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.72 magnitude (). In October 2010 and November 2011, two more lightcurves were obtained at the Palomar Transient Factory, rendering a period of 5.4048 and 5.4100 hours with an amplitude of 0.58 and 0.27 magnitude, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its NEOWISE mission, Sekiguchi measures between 13.9 and 15.2 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.192 and 0.3829. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 25.4 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.7.

The membership list reads like a Who's Who of Olympic athletes and the SMTC logo became a recognizable icon on the uniforms of those elite athletes. History In its first year of existence, 1968 Olympian from Puerto Rico, Willie Rios joined the club and qualified to run in the 1972 Summer Olympics. In 1974, member Reid Harter set the first American Record in the road 30 Kilometre run. By 1976, three team members qualified for the 1976 Summer Olympics.http://www.santamonicatrackclub.org/about-us.html Santa Monica Track Club In 1979, a young Carl Lewis, then known as a top level High School long jumper, joined the club for competitions beyond his collegiate career at the University of Houston. Lewis went on to be the dominant force in sprinting and long jump for the next decade. Coached in the off season by his collegiate coach Tom Tellez, other elite sprinters were attracted to the club, including Carol Lewis, Carl's sister and University of Houston teammates Joe DeLoach, Leroy Burrell and Kirk Baptiste. The club developed an impressive record of Olympic and World Championships, limited in many situations because teammates were the closest competition at the highest level. Lewis and Burrell exchanged the prestigious World Record in the 100 metres four times. Four members of the club, Michael Marsh, Leroy Burrell, Floyd Heard and Carl Lewis, representing the Santa Monica Track Club tied the world record in the 4x100 meters relay at the Herculis meet in Monaco. The record lasted for four days until it was surpassed by a team representing the USA that consisted of three of the SMTC members, with Dennis Mitchell replacing Heard.

The nationality law is stated in Constitution of Indonesia. The Indonesian nationality law is based on jus sanguinis and jus soli. The latest law regulating Indonesian nationality is Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). This law revokes Law No. 62/1958 (UU No. 62 Tahun 1958). Generally, Indonesian citizens are those natural Indonesian people and those of other nationalities that are endorsed by the law as Indonesian citizens. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize dual citizenship except for persons under the age of 18. By that age those who have not chosen their citizenship have to acquire an affidavit (, Limited Dual Indonesian Citizen Passport) in order to retain both citizenship. After reaching the age of 21, they must choose one citizenship. Historically, Indonesia has previously permitted dual nationality, as evidence by the Sino- Indonesian Dual Nationality Treaty that lasted from 1960 to 1980. The Indonesian government announced on 13 February 2020 that all nationals who have joined the terrorist group ISIL automatically lose their Indonesian citizenship the instant they joined, leaving them stateless as Indonesia does not recognize dual nationality apart from the above circumstances. Indonesia also refuses to repatriate ISIL fighters captured in Syria as their citizenship is now revoked. Indonesian citizen An Indonesian citizen is: * one who before the enactment of this law was already an Indonesian citizen * a child from a legal marriage whose parents are Indonesian citizens * a child from a legal marriage whose father is an Indonesian citizen and mother is a foreign citizen * a child from a legal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen and father is a foreign citizen * a child from a legal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen and father is stateless or whose nationality law does not give citizenship to offspring * a child from a legal marriage born within 300 days after the father's death and the father was an Indonesian citizen at the time of death * a child from an illegal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen * a child from an illegal marriage whose mother is a foreign citizen but the father is an Indonesian citizen and recognizes the child as his child before the child turns 18 or is married * a child born in Indonesian territory whose parent's citizenship status is unknown * a newly born child found in Indonesian territory as long as the father and mother are unknown * a child born in Indonesian territory if the parents are stateless or cannot be found * a child born outside of Indonesian territory whose parents are Indonesian citizens and, because of the law where the child was born, the child was granted another citizenship * a child from whose father or mother was already granted Indonesian citizenship but died before taking an oath of allegiance Obtaining Indonesian citizenship A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements: * being the age of 18 years or older, or being married * when applying, having resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non consecutive years * physically and mentally healthy * can speak the Indonesian language and acknowledge the Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia * never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more * if having Indonesian citizenship will not give the person dual citizenship * employed or have fixed income * pay the citizenship fee Any application for citizenship is granted by the President of Indonesia. Losing Indonesian citizenship This could happen if: * a person over the age of 18 obtains another citizenship by his/her own will * a person does not reject or release another citizenship even he/she has the opportunity to do so * A person renounces Indonesian citizenship to the President of Indonesia on his/her own will with the provision that he/she is already 18 years old or married, is staying in a foreign country, and is not stateless if he/she loses Indonesian citizenship * a person joins a foreign military without the President's permission * a person joins a terrorist group such as ISIL, unlike all other reasons, if this happens he/she is automatically made stateless, is permanently banned from re-entering Indonesia and permanently banned from reapplying for Indonesia citizenship * a person voluntarily taking another country's oath of allegiance * a person has a valid passport or other passport-like documents from a foreign country as proof of citizenship * staying outside Indonesian territory for 5 consecutive years, not stating the will to stay as Indonesian citizen before the 5-year period is over, and not reporting every 5 years to a representative of the Indonesian government Travel freedom Visa requirements for Indonesian citizens In 2018, Indonesian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 70 countries and territories, ranking the Indonesian passport 69th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.

Originally published by CSSM in 1950, it has been reprinted over a dozen times by various publishers, including braille versions published by the Royal National Institute for the Blind in 1959 and by the Queensland Braille Writing Association in 1996. The book is still in print today. Over the years it has been translated into and published in many languages, including Hungarian, Finnish, Danish, Chinese, Czech, German, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, Mari, Faroese, Polish, Welsh, Serbian, Bosnian, Romanian and Russian. An audiobook version in English was produced by Blackstone Audio in October 2005, available in CD, mp3 and audio cassette formats. Background Treasures of the Snow was Patricia St. John's second book, started soon after the end of World War II. The theme was forgiveness ‚Äì as she wrote in her autobiography, \\"The world was settling down after the war, but as the atrocities came to light there was so much anger and hatred. I remembered the boys coming back from the war to wives who had proved unfaithful. I remembered the faces of those who had seen the first photographic exhibition of the horrors of Belsen and the state of the bombed cities of Europe; the resentment of those who could not forgive others, the remorse of those who could not forgive themselves, and I knew that this generation of children needed, above all things, to learn the meaning of forgiveness.\\" The story is set in Switzerland, where the author spent some time as a child, and is written for children aged eight and above. The narrative is centred on three children, and explores love, hatred, death, disability, repentance, self-sacrifice, forgiveness and reconciliation. Woven through the story runs a frank description of the children's thoughts, motives, struggles, feelings and fears as well as their prayers and their developing Christian faith. Plot summary Annette Burnier lives with her father, elderly grandmother and young brother Dani in a small village in the Swiss mountains. When she is eight years old her mother dies just after Dani's birth, and since the family is too poor to afford a nanny, Annette takes the responsibility upon herself, arranging with the schoolmaster to study at home under her grandmother's guidance. When Dani is old enough for her to return to school, she does well and often gains top marks. On Dani's fifth Christmas, he puts his slipper outside in the snow, hoping that Father Christmas will bring him a present. In the morning, to everyone's astonishment, a tiny white kitten has snuggled into the slipper. Dani calls him Klaus and the two become inseparable. Further up the mountain in the next chalet, Annette's classmate Lucien Morel lives with his elder sister Marie and their widowed mother. Lucien finds schoolwork difficult and is frustrated that he is often bottom of the class. He also resents having to help around the home and farm with all the tasks that his father would have done, and his mother and sister criticise his laziness. Conflict flares one day when Lucien is sledging down to school and accidentally collides with Annette's sledge, throwing her into a ditch full of snow. Out of resentment at her success in school, he doesn't stop to help her, but speeds off to school instead. When she arrives late, cold, wet and grazed, with torn wet books, Annette has to explain what happened. Lucien is caned by the schoolmaster, and ostracised by the rest of the class. While on his way home he vents his frustration by kicking over a snowman Dani has built, causing Annette to run out and slap his face and shout angrily at him. Lucien's increasing loneliness and festering hurt is directed at Annette and looks for opportunities for revenge. When he sees Dani in a meadow picking flowers for Annette's birthday one day, he grabs the flowers and tramples on them. Then afraid Dani would get him into trouble, he picks up Klaus and holds him out over a deep ravine, threatening (but not intending) to drop the kitten unless Dani promises not to tell. Klaus, however, scratches Lucien, and he lets go by accident. Dani rushes across and falls over the cliff into the ravine while trying to save his kitten. Lucien is terrified and griefstricken, convinced that Dani is dead, and flees home to hide in the barn, unable to face his family. When the worried families find Lucien, he confesses what had happened. Dani's father uses a rope to climb down the ravine and finds Dani still alive at the bottom, but with a broken leg. Dani's leg heals badly, shorter than the other leg, leaving him permanently unable to walk without crutches. The whole village hears about Lucien's involvement with Dani's accident, and he becomes an outcast. Working hard around the home and farm helps him stop brooding for a while, and his mother praises him for this while his sister becomes kinder to him. But his real solace is to climb to the woods and spend time alone, carving little figures out of wood, which he finds he has a real talent for. Here he meets and makes friends with an old man who lives alone in a tiny chalet high above the village, whose only income comes from selling his own woodcarvings. He mentors Lucien and let him use his woodcarving tools, helping him improve his skills. He also confides in Lucien his life story. As a young man he had been happily married with two young sons and a good job in a bank, but then got into bad company and became addicted to alcohol and gambling. To pay the family's debts he stole from the bank and ended up in prison. His wife died, but his sons were adopted by their grandparents and became very successful. When he got out of prison, he did not want his sons' futures jeopardised by being associated with a criminal, so let them assume he was dead. He had lived alone on the mountain for many years and saved a lot of money from the beautiful woodcarvings he sold, similar to the amount he had stolen. He could not repay the people he had stolen from, since he did not know who they were, but his hope was that instead he might be able to use the money to help someone in need. Lucien is constantly burdened by the guilt of what he had done to Dani, but Annette's hatred towards him makes it impossible for him to do anything to try and right it. He carves a Noah's Ark full of little animals for Dani, but Annette simply throws it on the woodpile when he tries to deliver it. Lucien also decides to enter one of his carvings for the hand- craft competition at school, but shortly before the competition Annette secretly smashes the carved horse out of spite, but goes on to wins the girls' competition while a boy named Pierre won the boys'. Because of their guilt and bitterness, neither Annette nor Lucien can find peace of mind or happiness. One night Annette goes out for a walk alone, slips on ice and sprains her ankle very badly. She struggles to the nearest chalet but the owners were away and being unable to walk, finds herself in danger of freezing to death. To her relief Lucien skis past while on his way home from visiting his old friend. She calls for help and he gives her his cloak while he goes home to fetch a sledge. When he returns, Annette confesses to him about breaking his carved horse, but instead of being angry Lucien forgives her and takes her home on the sledge, where Annette invites him in. Later Annette confesses to the schoolmaster, and they agree that he should present her prize to Lucien. The enmity is over, but Lucien still feels troubled with guilt about Dani's disability. One evening Lucien's sister, who commutes by train to work in a hotel in the nearest town, comes home with a generous tip from a famous orthopaedic surgeon, Monsieur Givet, who is staying at the hotel. Intrigued, Lucien asks whether he can make Dani better, but is told the doctor is leaving the hotel for home early the next morning, and that his fees are far too expensive. Undeterred, Lucien creeps out of the house that night in a blizzard and goes to talk with his friend the old man, telling him about Monsieur Givet and that he might be able to cure Dani. The old man gives Lucien a sock full of banknotes to pay for the treatment, but makes him promise to not tell the doctor where the money was obtained, telling Lucien \\"Just tell him that it is the payment of a debt.\\" Lucien attempts to climb and ski to the town, which involves crossing a high mountain pass. Despite the atrocious weather he reaches the hotel about 5 am. Monsieur Givet goes with Lucien to visit Dani, and offers to treat him in his hospital. But before he leaves the village, he asks Lucien's sister where the old man lived that Lucien knew, and goes to visit him. He recognises the old man as his father and invites him to come home after telling him how much he had missed him. Annette goes with Dani to stay in the hospital. His fractured leg is re-broken and set properly, and Dani returns home able to walk and run like any little boy. Everybody is reunited with each other as spring arrives.

He was commissioned to write works by the Buffalo Philharmonic (the symphonic poems Toronto 1830 and Mizu Uni), clarinetist Avrahm Galper (Peanut Suite for solo clarinet), and guitarist Gregory Alliston (Barca for guitar and soprano). Several of his works for violin have been published by The Frederick Harris Music Co, Limited, including three graded volumes for teaching purposes between 1987-1989. Life and career Born in Vancouver, Hyslop began his violin studies as a child in his native city with Allard de Ridder and Jean de Rimanoczy. He began his performance career as a teenager performing as a soloist on CNRV radio. Early on in his career he served as concertmaster or as a member of various orchestras associated with the CRBC and CBC in Vancouver. In 1941 Hyslop became music director for CBC Vancouver's Harmony House, a program featuring the singers Pat Morgan and Suzanne and the pianist Bud Henderson. He continued in that position up through 1953, during which time he also worked as a conductor for CBC Radio on such variety shows as Here's Juliette, String Along, and Scored by Hyslop among others. In 1959 he relocated to Toronto to become the music director for CBC Television's Talent Caravan. He left that program after a short time, returning to CBC Radio where he was music director for such programs as 1967 and All That and CBC Song Market among other programs during the 1960s. Hyslop also worked as a composer for the CBC, writing incidental music for such CBC TV drama series as The Serial, Opening of the West, Gold - the Fabulous Years, A Place for Everything, and A Gift to Last and contributing music to several TV specials. He also composed music for the CTV Television Network programs The Human Journey and Being Human and composed the film score for the 1977 feature film Why Shoot the Teacher. He later wrote the score for the 1995 CTV News video The Russian German War. Hyslop died in Toronto in 1998 at the age of 83. In 2000 many of his original scores and papers became a part of the collection at the Library and Archives Canada. He was married to the singer Lorraine Johnson who notably wrote the lyrics to his one-act school operetta Sedna: An Arctic Legend which was published in 1982. Their daughter, pop singer Jane Child, included Hyslop's song Monument on her 1993 album Here Not There.

It lies north of Lavender Hill and Clapham Common and east of Clapham Junction railway station. The estate occupies a flat area of land at the edge of the River Thames flood plain, just north of the slope rising to Clapham Common. Historically, the area was occupied by Battersea Fields, the poorly drained common land covering the area as far as the river. The Heathwall River ran along the foot of the slope and drained into the River Effra and Falcon Brook, making Battersea an island; present-day Heathwall Street marks the line of this watercourse. A stream crossed the area on the line of present-day Grayshott Road. History In the Middle Ages the area was known as Pig Hill because of the large number of piggeries in the area. The Domesday Book says that brickmaking was carried on in some fields on Pig Hill. Cattle breeding also flourished to some extent in the area. Pig Hill formed part of Latchmoor Common, an area of common land belonging to the parish for the common good. Under the power of the Inclosure Act dating back to William IV, the overseer of any parish had the power to enclose waste or common land, less than , lying in or near the parish. Under the Act, the parish then had to cultivate and improve such waste land for the use and benefit of the parish, and also had the power to let such enclosed land in allotments to the inhabitants of the parish to be cultivated on their own account. Taking advantage of this Act, the churchwardens and overseers of Battersea enclosed about of Latchmoor Common and let it out in allotments at a low rental, to the residents of the parish, for the cultivation of vegetables. At the start of the seventeenth century, the allotments were flourishing and Battersea had become famous for its market gardening. The gardeners were known for their quality produce which fetched high prices in the London markets and were the first growers to cultivate and introduce asparagus. One gardener had of asparagus under cultivation, and at one time there were three hundred acres of market gardens within a mile of St Mary's Church, Battersea. The gardens were most probably improved by the Huguenots who settled in Wandsworth in 1639. When Pig Hill became Latchmere Road this land was known as the Latchmere allotments. The allotments were later sold to Samuel Poupart (the rail junction to the north is still known as Poupart's Junction) and became known as Poupart's Market Garden. Housing An example of the characteristically \\"paired\\" doors of the Victorian terraces In the 1870s, it became residential when the Artizans, Labourers and General Dwelling Company, a housing co- operative founded in 1867 by William Austin, built several thousand small homes on it. The company was dedicated to providing decent accommodation for the working classes at a time when overcrowding and squalid living conditions were rife amongst the poor. Money was raised to undertake small developments for sale, the proceeds of which were then invested in larger estates, like Shaftesbury Park, for renting. The land for the Battersea estate was purchased in 1872; three other estates were developed elsewhere. The original concept was to combine new housing of various classes with social facilities such as meeting rooms, school rooms, a wash house and baths, and to provide integral open space (3 acres of the bought). One facility certainly not to be provided on the estate was a public house, which was an attempt by the reformers behind the scheme to avoid the social problems of cheap alcohol. At the same time as the conception of the estate, the social reformer and peer Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury was pushing legislation through parliament to improve the living and employment conditions of working people and sponsoring philanthropic efforts to provide schooling for their children. Under Shaftesbury's guardianship new so-called Ragged Schools were established providing free education in 1844. On 3 August 1872, Shaftesbury laid the foundation-stone of buildings at the estate, thus giving it a name. The estate layout and house designs were by the company's Architect and Surveyor, Robert Austin, formerly a carpenter with the company. However, financial difficulties, caused by poor accounting, led to replacement of the directors of the company and a change of approach during the construction of the estate. Rents and lease prices were raised, excluding many lower paid workers who were originally intended to benefit, and the planned area of open space was built over ‚Äì Brassey Square in the centre of the estate. Buildings and townscape The estate was built between 1873 and 1877 and comprises about 1,200 two- storey houses with gardens laid out in wide tree-lined streets. The estate houses are of four basic types or classes distinguished by the number of rooms (only the highest class originally had bathrooms). The street elevations are varied slightly to avoid monotony, creating generally attractive street frontages. They are consistently of stock brick with red brick dressings and pitched slate roofs, which gives the estate a sense of identity and distinctiveness. The grid layout, with streets of varying lengths but always straight (except Eversleigh Road, which is aligned with the railway embankment), allows for easy movement throughout the estate. There is a sense of formality in the townscape arising from the grid layout and the repetition in the building frontages. The Peabody Trust owns most of the estate, but many homes are already privately owned, and the number continues to rise as the Trust gradually releases more units for sale.

The Mackenzies were a clan from the Northwest Highlands that had risen to prominence in the 15th century during the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles. Mackenzie‚Äôs ancestor, Hector Roy Mackenzie, had acquired the lands of Gairloch towards the end of the 15th century. Mackenzie‚Äôs mother, Mary, was the daughter of Osgood Hanbury, of Holfield Grange, Essex.Osgood Hanbury Mackenzie, A Hundred Years in the Highlands (Edwin Arnold, London, 1921) Life Mackenzie‚Äôs father died a year or so after he was born. He was educated at home, in the tradition of his family, and brought up to speak both English and Gaelic. In 1862, with the help of his mother he purchased the estate of Inverewe and Kernsary. The Gazetteer for Scotland (accessed on 22 April 2010) There he built a Scottish Baronial style mansion and set about creating a garden. Mackenzie concentrated first on establishing shelter belts of Native and Scandinavian pines and built a walled garden. He also created woodland walks. Within 40 years, he had established one of the finest collections in Scotland of temperate plants from both Northern and Southern hemispheres.About Scotland, Scottish Landscape: Inverewe Garden (accessed on 22 April 2010) Mackenzie wrote a volume of memoirs (published by Edwin Arnold in London in 1921), entitled A Hundred Years in the Highlands. A second edition of these (Geoffrey Bles, London, 1949) contained an additional chapter by his daughter. Little space in the memoirs is devoted to Mackenzie's gardening activities; they instead provide a charming account of Highland country life and society, both in Mackenzie's own time and in his grandfather's. Family On 26 June 1877, Mackenzie married Minna Amy, the daughter of Sir Thomas Edwards-Moss, 1st Baronet. They had one child, Mary (Mairi) Thyra, who married first (18 April 1907) Robert John Hanbury (died 5 April 1933) and secondly (2 July 1935) Captain Ronald Sawyer (died 25 October 1945).

Overview  In traditional GSM networks, a call between two Mobile Stations (MS) involve a dual encoding/decoding process. Speech signals are first encoded in the originating MS, converted to G.711 in the local transcoder, converted back to a GSM codec in the remote transcoder and finally converted back to speech at the terminating MS. In this configuration the two transcoders are operating in tandem introducing a voice quality degradation. It is possible to eliminate this problem by removing the two transcoding operations in the voice path if the two MS are using the same codec.  Details  Broadly, the equipments that are en-route two end mobile sets can be categorized into two types: * Active voice equipments, that does the transcoding operation, either from a GSM/UMTS speech codec (e.g.: GSM-EFR, GSM-AMR) to G.711/PCM or opposite. * Passive equipments (or In-Path Equipment), does not transcode, but change the voice signals in some way. For example: Line Echo Canceller, attenuation algorithms or any equipment that change the voice samples.  Active Equipment  These equipment are typically at the edge of the core networks that acts as a gateway between mobile core networks (IP based) and digital PSTN networks. Mobile core IP networks carry voice encoded in the form of one of the GSM/UMTS codecs (e.g.: GSM AMR). When this has to be carried over a G.711/PCM based PSTN network, the gateway equipment transcodes from GSM/UMTS codec to G.711 PCM samples. This results in a certain loss of voice quality. A single G.711/PCM sample is an 8-bit value and is sampled at the rate of 8 kHz. Hence, the bandwidth requirement is 64kbit/s, with each bit corresponding to 8kbit/s. TFO is a mechanism that steals least significant bits (LSBs) of PCM samples to literally embed the bits from encoded stream. Since most GSM/UMTS codec rates are around the range of 8kbit/s to 16kbit/s (and higher rates of up to 32kbit/s for 16 kHz sampled Wide Band codecs), one needs to steal only about 1 or 2 LSBs of total 8 bits. This aspect is very important, as, if there is a breakage in TFO connection, the upper most significant bits (MSBs) can still be used to carry transcoded G.711/PCM sample values. The degradation due to loss of 1 or 2 LSBs is not much. The remote transcoder equipment then extracts the encoded stream from LSBs of PCM samples and reconstructs it as codec frames and then sent as though it was encoded by itself, thereby virtually avoiding two iterations of trancoding. = Flow = The transcoder equipment that supports TFO runs a well defined state machine. Based on the sequence of events, the state machine table defines a sequence of actions to be performed. As a part of this sequence, the local transcoder sends TFO In-band Signalling messages (IS_Messages) on the LSBs of the PCM samples. The protocol is very well defined in the specification documents. The remote transcoder equipment that receives these messages, acknowledges (ACKs) with its own IS_Messages. Upon initial exchange, the two transcoders also exchange their capabilities (the codecs they support, etc.). Once a common codec is decided, they both start streaming PCM samples with LSBs containing encoded stream.  In-Path Equipment (IPE)  As described earlier, these are not active equipment that does transcoding. These typically come in the path of two transcoders. To ensure that the TFO stream that is embedded in the LSBs of PCM samples are not touched by these equipments, even these have to be aware of TFO. The specifications define the role for these. In a nutshell, these equipments have to detect TFO traffic (by checking for IS_Messages on the input) and ensure that these are not touched on the output.

He would eventually go on to gradually establish himself as a regular within the team until the at 2005 league season saw second tier side Hunan Billows willing to pay 3.8 million RMB for him. Liu Cheng left after only one season to go on to join reigning league champions Dalian Shide F.C. where he struggled to hold down a regular place within the team. In the 2007 league season he would go on to join second tier side Chengdu Blades and quickly see them win promotion when they came second within the league. With Chengdu he would go on to establish himself as their first choice right-back and see the team become mid-table regulars until the team were relegated at the end of the 2009 league season after it was discovered that the club had fixed a game in their 2007 promotion. While none of the players were implicated with match fixing, Liu Cheng decided to leave the club and at the beginning of the 2010 league season he joined top tier club Changsha Ginde, which brought him back to his hometown of Changsha on a swap deal with Song Zhenyu and the club quickly made him their first choice right-back.

Establishment and overview PACT was established by Lady Catherine Meyer, CBE in 1999. 10 October 2007, PACT and the National Missing Persons Bureau launched Missing Children TV, a TV channel showing photographs and information on some of the 100,000 children that go missing every year. Electronics Health Media (EHM) screened the channel in various hospital waiting rooms around the country. In 2012, PACT helped produced a website called \\"Missingkids\\", allowing law enforcement to disseminate photographs and descriptions of missing children alongside details of the circumstances of their disappearance. In 2014, PACT produced the British Child Abduction Hub, an information repository allowing for information related to child abduction to be spread publicly via a \\"Child Rescue Alert\\", similar in concept to the American Amber Alert. Partnerships Over the years, PACT has partnered with various organizations to raise public awareness of the plight of missing and abducted children. British grocery chain Tesco has partnered with PACT since 2000 by displaying posters of missing children in select stores. In 2006, engineering and management services corporation Emcor partnered with PACT by placing posters of missing children in the rear windows of some of their vehicles. In March 2009, Emcor announced that four children featured on their posters had been found. Documentary and research papers PACT has produced a documentary entitled Victims of Another War that examines the damaging impact on three adults of their abduction as children. PACT has also produced a number of reports and research papers dealing with abduction and child protection services: * Every Five Minutes (2005), which examined available data to try to establish the number of missing children in the UK. * A Postcode Lottery (2006), which discussed the services rendered by various child protection agencies in the UK. * Beyond Every Five Minutes (2007). * Taken (2013), which examined the extent of child abduction in the UK. * In February 2015, PACT released a report examining the number of child abductions and kidnappings reported to police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2012 to 2014.

The Act established the membership of each commission, the procedures to be followed by the commissions, and the rules for the redistribution of seats for the commissions to observe. The commissions' initial reviews of constituencies under the Act were implemented by the Representation of the People Act 1948.The Boundary Commissions: redrawing the UK's map of Parliamentary constituencies; D J Rossiter, R J Johnston, C J Pattie; Manchester University Press, 1999. Speaker's Conference and resultant legislation The rules continuing into the 21st century for the redistributions of seats in the House Commons evolved from the Speaker‚Äôs Conference in 1944. The Conference recommended an electoral quota for Great Britain calculated from the electorate and a 25 per cent tolerance on either side and that the total number of Members of the House of Commons should remain substantially the same with the Northern Ireland seats fixed at 12; the number of Scottish seats should be not less than 71 and the number of Welsh seats not less than 35. This was swiftly enacted in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. In the period 1944 to 1958, the primacy of equality rule was diluted in five ways by further legislation:Commons Briefing paper: SN05628 Author: Oonagh Gay, 2010, House of Commons Library, http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05628#fullreport *Abolition of strict 25 per cent rule *Introduction of separate quotas for England, Wales and Scotland *Greater presumption against inconveniences of disruption. *Mandatory local inquiries in certain circumstances *A longer period between reviews of 10 to 15 years, rather than 3 to 7 Thereafter, the Rules were only subject to minor change by statute, mainly to take account of changes in local authority structures. The boundary commissions The Speaker of the House of Commons was to be the chairman of each of the four commissions. The remaining members were as follows: =Boundary Commission for England= *The Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England *The Director General of the Ordnance Survey *One member appointed by the Home Secretary *One member appointed by the Minister of Health =Boundary Commission for Scotland= *The Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in Scotland *The Director General of the Ordnance Survey *Two members appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland =Boundary Commission for Wales= *The Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England *The Director General of the Ordnance Survey *One member appointed by the Home Secretary *One member appointed by the Minister of Health (For the purposes of the Act Wales included Monmouthshire) =Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland= *The Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages for Northern Ireland *The Commissioner of Valuation for Northern Ireland *Two other members appointed by the Home Secretary No member of the Commons, or of either house of the Parliament of Northern Ireland was qualified to be a commissioner, and any serving commissioner would be disqualified on becoming a member of any of these bodies. Rules for redistribution of seats The Act contained a number of rules to guide the work of the commissions. =Number of constituencies= *Great Britain was to have \\"not substantially greater or less than\\" 591 constituencies. *Scotland was to have not less than 71 constituencies. *Wales was to have not less than 35 constituencies. *Northern Ireland was to have 12 constituencies. =Rules on dividing and combining counties and districts= \\"As far as practicable\\" in England and Wales: *No county (or any part thereof) was to be included in a constituency with the whole or part of any other county, or part of a county borough or a metropolitan borough. *No county borough (or any part thereof) was to be included in a constituency with any other county borough or part of a metropolitan borough. *No metropolitan borough was to be included in a constituency which included the whole or part of any other metropolitan borough. *No county district (municipal borough, urban district or rural district) was to be included partly in one constituency and partly in another. In Scotland: *No county or burgh could be partly in one parliamentary county and partly in another, or be divided between a parliamentary county and a parliamentary burgh. *No burgh other than a county of a city was to be divided between constituencies. In Northern Ireland: *No county district was to be included partly in one constituency and partly in another. =Electorate= The electorate of any constituency should not differ from the \\"electoral quota\\" by more than 25%. The electoral quota was obtained by dividing the total electorate for either Great Britain or Northern Ireland by the number of allocated seats. =Special geographical considerations= Each commission were allowed to depart from the rules on areas or electorate in special cases \\"including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency\\" in order to form constituencies. Amendment and repeal The 1944 Act was amended by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1947, and succeeded by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 which amended the rules for the redistribution of seats, but did not change the membership or procedures of the commissions.

It serves the adjacent car float operation New York New Jersey Rail, barge-to-rail transfer of New York waste, and the adjacent GCT Global container facility. In 2010, the PANYNJ purchased the yard with the intention to upgrade it, particularly to support New York solid waste transfer and reduce truck trips. In 2011, the PANYNJ contracted HDR, Inc. as primary design consultant. In September 2014, the PANYNJ announced funding for the major redevelopment of the Greenville Yard, to include a new rail container terminal. About 10,000 feet of working track, 32,000 feet of support track and switches, along with infrastructure to support rail-mounted gantry cranes, will be constructed for the ExpressRail terminal, which will initially support 125,000 container lifts a year. The PANYNJ will also build two new rail-to-barge transfer bridges, purchase two new car float barges, each with 18 rail car capacity, and buy four new ultra low emission locomotives, replacing antiquated units. Of the project‚Äôs $356 million cost, $320 million will be paid by the agency with the remainder coming from stakeholders. The new facility is expected to become operational in July 2016. The New Jersey Department of Transportation allocated more than $87 million for 2014-2017 fiscal budget for the project and other related word, including land acquisition. Construction began in December 2016, with completion expected in 2018. The first phase of the project, with four tracks and two gantry cranes, opened on January 7, 2019. The second and final phase of the project, with four additional tracks bringing the total number of tracks to eight, was opened on June 17, 2019. GCT will operate the yard. History =Pennsylvania Railroad= 1912 PRR map showing the Greenville Terminal and its car float operations, also the current crossing Bridge No. 14, decades later, partially collapsed The Greenville Yard takes its name from the former town of Greenville which became part of Jersey City in the 1860s. The yard also lends its name to a nearby industrial park and distribution center. The yard was first developed in 1904 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and opened with three based on designs of their bridges at Harsimus Cove. They were referred to as No.11, No.12, and No.13. A number of different organizations were involved in its construction: the Steele & Condict Company of New Jersey manufactured the bridge mechanisms, Henry Steers, Inc. did the foundation, pile racks, bridges, and aprons, while the Cooper-Wigand-Cooke Company and the R.P. & J.H. Staats Company of New York jointly erected the bridge superstructure and transfer machinery housing. The new designs utilized electric motors and controls, and a live load counterweight system. PRR set the industry standard for electrified lift bridges with this design; virtually identical bridges were built in the Port of New York and New Jersey area by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad at their Oak Point Yard in 1908, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at their St. George, Staten Island terminal in 1912. A fourth bridge, No.14, was added in 1910, and a fifth, No.10, in 1924. This was constructed by the Schuylkill Bridge Works Division of the Lewis F. Shoemaker & Company.https://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/nj/nj1600/nj1606/data/nj1606data.pdf On January 1, 1931, a short-circuit caused the wooden superstructure of Bridge No.10 to ignite. Within 15 minutes, two more superstructures and the wooden transfer house were ablaze. As there were no roads to the yard, land-based firefighters had to be brought in a mile by rail. There were 50 firefighters and land, and 20 tugs and fire boats. The only injury reported was a fractured ankle, when the employee jumped down a burning stairwell to survive. The car float and 25 cars owned by the NYNH&H; that were docked at Bridge No.10 were a total loss, while three other car floats that sustained varying damage were salvageable. All five bridges were put out of service, and freight was rerouted through PRR's other facilities in Harsimus Cove and Exchange Place, in addition to the Lehigh Valley Railroad's terminal on the Morris Canal Basin. The fire cost the PRR $500,000 and $1 million, which in the 2014 value of the dollar would be between $7.772 million and $15.55 million. It put unemployed 300 workers, although within two days they were put to work repairing bridges at Greenville or working at other PRR yards in the area. The American Bridge Company was contracted to rebuild the bridges, and were built functionally identical to the previous bridges; the design of the bridges were still extremely efficient, and the only major change was the elimination of any wood. Bridges Nos. 10, 13, and 14 were initially repaired, with No.12 being cleared for rebuilding in 1939. Because of World War II, however, the plan was suspended indefinitely. A new bridge, No.9, was later put into service in November 9, 1943 to satisfy traffic being generated by the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Brooklyn Army Terminal across the bay. These two facilities were most often the last place troops and supplies went before embarking to Europe.Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) No. NJ-49, \\"Greenville Yard, Transfer Bridge System \\" =PANYNJ= In May 2010, the Port Authority announced that it would purchase the Greenville Yard and build a new barge-to- rail facility there, as well as improving the existing rail car float system. The barge-to-rail facility is expected to handle an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 containers of solid waste per year from New York City, eliminating up to 360,000 trash truck trips a year. The authority's board authorized $118.1 million for the overall project.

Nadderud is a district in eastern B√¶rum, Norway. It was formerly farmland under one of B√¶rum's larger farms, named Nadderud, but since the 1950s it has been built up with housing, several schools and sporting facilities. The best known facility, which has made the name Nadderud nationally known, is the stadium Nadderud stadion. Parts of the district Nadderud have been absorbed by the growing suburban centre Bekkestua. Geography Part of Hoslebekken. Today's meaning of Nadderud is the district north and west of Bekkestua, northeast of Gj√∏nnes, east of Haslum, south of Hosle and southwest of Grav. The district was formerly a watery area, with several small creeks combining into one before emptying into √òverlandselva. Most of the Nadderud Watershed () has been led underground through a pipe system. One creek, Eiksbekken/Gravsbekken, originates north of Eiksmarka, and portions of it still exist. Another creek, Nadderudbekken, originated at Eikeli and flowed more or less in a straight southwestern direction, and at one point formed the pond Nadderuddammen. It was used for leisure ice skating during the winter, but exists no more. Another minor creek originated at L√∏nn√•s, and another creek Hoslebekken originated at Hosle. This is the only other significant portion of the watershed which is still visible. The confluence of the three main creeks is south of Gj√∏nnes farm. After this, much of the riverbed is used as a pedestrian road between Gj√∏nnes and the road Kirkeveien at Haslum. Where the creek crossed Kirkeveien, there was formerly a bridge, but it has been filled with solid material. History The etymology of the name Nadderud is uncertain, but it has been recorded as Naderud (1434 and 1617), Narderudt (1557), Nadderudt (1578), but also Nadderud in older times (1594 and 1723). The suffix -rud indicates that someone cleared an area to make a farm. The farm Nadderud belonged to Hoved√∏ya Monastery before the Protestant Reformation, then to the crown before getting a private owner from 1663, Jens Paulsen Grav. He was succeeded as owner by his son-in-law, and during this time the farm was a bailiff seat as well. Limestone burning was also conducted. Limestone was notably delivered to Akershus Fortress in 1629, to Moss in 1634 and to the Royal Palace in 1827. In the 1750s the farm was split into Upper and Lower Nadderud. Lower Nadderud was sold in 1900 to a trade union, and was built up under the name Egne Hjem (from 1902), except for the property Bjerkelunden which became a small park. Upper Nadderud remained a farm, most notably under the ownership of Hans Burum from 1911 to his death in 1925. The farm had livestock, and also grew rare vegetables and fruits such as tomato, cucumber and melon, which proved especially important during World War I. The farm had eight horses, eighteen cattle and 25 sheep in 1826, and in 1939 the farm had four horses, 40 cattle and 365 swine. Farming at Nadderud was drastically reduced in the 1950s, and large parts of the farmland was sold. Villas were built, but also schools and sporting facilities. Several sub-farms were originally part of Nadderud. The most notable is Presterud, located on the southern outskirts of Nadderud, close to Gj√∏nnes farm. In modern times it had a greenhouse, and 20 decares of cultivated land. It has now been absorbed by Bekkestua. Sports Stab√¶k faced Lillestr√∏m at Nadderud in 2007. The district is nationally known for Nadderud stadion, the combined association football (used by Stab√¶k women, formerly Stab√¶k men, B√¶rum men and Jardar women) and track and field athletics stadium. It was finished in 1966. The stadium is a part of a greater sports park. Nadderudhallen is a large complex mainly used for swimming, diving, team handball (used by Haslum men and Stab√¶k men and women), basketball and martial arts. Oslo International School has its own sports facilities, but is planning a new indoor venue adjacent to Nadderudhallen. There are two artificial turf football fields named Nadderud kunstgress, and two grass fields named Nadderudfeltet and Bekkestuabanen respectively. The latter has been used as a training field by Norway national football team. Between the stadium and the hall is found a tennis court, used by the club Eiksmarka TK. Arena Bekkestua is an indoor venue for skateboarding, rollerblades, BMX and the like (and is also a minor concert hall). As an athletics stadium, Nadderud stadion has no warm-up field, but IL Tyrving operates a field for hammer throw and discus throw adjacent to Bekkestuabanen, because holding these events at Nadderud stadion is not compatible with maintaining a top-level football pitch. Education =Schools= An upper secondary school was established in 1958, not far from Gj√∏nnes farm, under the name Nadderud. Politicians agreed to building the school in 1957, but it was only intended to last for five years. It had 326 students in 1958, 547 in 1965 and existed until 2004. In 2004 it was replaced by a new school between Gj√∏nnes and Haslum; the name Nadderud was kept. Oslo International School was established in 1963, but has not been located at Nadderud all the time, and got its current name in 1989. It is both a primary school, lower secondary school and upper secondary school with the International Baccalaureate program. A lower secondary school not far from Nadderud farm was established on 18 September 1968, under the name Bekkestua. Its size has shrunken from 662 students in 1970 to 372 students in 2005. The Norwegian College of Elite Sport, incidentally not a college. In 2003 the Norwegian College of Elite Sport (, NTG), which is not a college but an upper secondary school with sports, was moved from V√∏yenenga to a site near Nadderud farm. Already in 2004 a lower secondary school, NTG-U, was added. =Higher education= The Norwegian College of Elite Sport was co-located with NKI Fjernundervisning, an institution for remote education which moved to Nadderud from Lysaker in 1989. NKI stands for \\"Norsk kunnskapsinstitutt\\". NKI decided to move from Nadderud to Oslo in 2012. Connected to NKI is the school Norwegian School of Information Technology, which was created in 1995, but moved to Oslo in 2003. Another related school N√¶ringsakademiet was discontinued in 2007, the same year when all above institutions were bought by the company Anthon B Nilsen. On the address of the Norwegian College of Elite Sport and NKI, Hans Burums vei 30, the Norwegian School of Management was located from 1979 until 1988 when it moved to Sandvika. Transport A bus connection between Nadderud and Oslo has existed since 1952. The district is today served directly by lines 131 and 732 of Ruter's bus network, with many more operating from nearby Bekkestua; as well as the airport shuttle bus Flybussekspressen run by NOR-WAY Bussekspress. Nadderud is not directly served by rail transport; Bekkestua Station is the most proximate Oslo Metro station after Egne Hjem Station.

The Nordisk Defence Club () is an interest organisation operating in the Nordic countries. It was established in Copenhagen in 1889 and moved to Oslo in 1891. The invitation to Nordisk‚Äôs founding meeting in Copenhagen said the purpose of the association would be ‚Äúto work in the interest of shipping‚Äù. A key reason for its establishment was to organize shipowners in a common effort to avoid unreasonable charterparty clauses imposed by charterers in the prevailing poor market. This included working to develop standardized charter parties. One of the documents Nordisk worked on was the Baltcon charterparty, which became the first document of BIMCO in 1908. Nordisk has ever since been involved in the drafting of a large number of BIMCO documents, including Baltime, NYPE, Norwegian Saleform, Barecon, Shipman and Supplytime. Nordisk began issuing a collection of maritime court and arbitration decisions from the Nordic countries in 1900. Known as Nordiske domme i sj√∏fartsanliggender ND), it is still edited and published regularly by Nordisk.

The Royal Enfield Thunderbird is known as Royal Enfield Rumbler in export markets. The predecessor of the Royal Enfield Thunderbird was the Royal Enfield Lightning 535cc cast iron 4-speed albion gearbox (right side gear shifter) engine, produced from years 2000-2002. The thunderbird was first introduced in the year 2002 with a 350 cc AVL lean burn aluminium engine and a five-speed gearbox with the gear shifter on the left side. It is also the first Royal Enfield to be fitted with a constant vacuum MIKUNI-UCAL Carburettor in stock condition from the company. Initially manufactured models have 'MIKUNI UCAL' in 3D on the carburettors, while the later generation models were fitted with 'UCAL' carburettors from the company. AVL stands for Anstalt f√ºr Verbrennungskraftmaschinen List (German for \\"Institute for Combustion Engines\\"), an Austrian-based automotive consulting firm as well as an independent research institute. The AVL Royal Enfield engine was first introduced in the year 2000 with a 4-speed gearbox (Albion Motors, Engine gearbox) with the gear shifter on the right side like the old cast-iron head-block Enfield engines on the iconic Royal Enfield Machismo with an AVL Aluminium Head block. The 4-speed AVL aluminum engines with right side gear shifter were produced from 2000-2002 (approx less than 2 years), where as, the 5-speed AVL aluminum engines with left side gear shifter were produced from 2002-2009 (approx less than 7 years). This makes the Royal Enfield AVL engines rare and quite the collectors item. The Royal Enfield Electra, Machismo and Thunderbird all would later share the same 5-speed AVL engine 2002 onward till 2009. The AVL engines when compared to the Cast Iron would share the same pre unit engine of 4 & 5 speed, but different head blocks of Aluminium or Cast Iron respectively. The AVL engine had a higher compression and shorter stroke when compared to the Cast Iron Engine. Both Cast Iron and AVL Engines would come with a manual decompress lever, as seen on the Royal Enfield AVL Thunderbird & Machismo. 1st Generation AVL 5-speed engine Royal Enfield Thunderbird's were produced from 2002 to 2005. These consisted of CDI only as part of its electricals. The bikes were reliable and would start without the need of a battery, in company stock condition, making it more reliable than the Cast-Iron or the UCE Royal Enfield that needs a battery to start. The chassis were strong-thick-heavy-gauge used from the old cast iron Enfield's like the 350's/500's Royal Enfield Lightning, Deluxe, Standard Bullet, Machismo etc. 2nd Generation AVL 5-speed engine Royal Enfield Thunderbird's were produced from 2005 to 2009. These consisted of CDI+TCI as part of its electricals. Due to TCI the bikes would require a Battery to start in company stock condition. Incorporating TCI in its electricals would help achieve a more consistent current from the battery to the spark plug. In 2009, the AVL semi-unit engine was replaced with the new 346 cc unit construction engine (UCE). The bike was renamed Thunderbird Twinspark owing to the twin sparkplugs in the UCE. Lighter gauge chassis to reduce weight were incorporated inorder to improve performance. This led to a downgrade in terms of quality strength for the UCE Thunderbird as compared to the AVL Thunderbird, however, an upgrade in terms of performance for the UCE Thunderbird due to lighter weight leading to comparatively faster pickup. The final drive chain is moved to the right side and it is the most obvious change from the old model apart from the new engine. The first generation UCE Thunderbird would share the same 14.3 litre fuel tank and mudguards as the AVL Thunderbird along with 19 inch front and rear wheels. The fuel tank, mudguards along with seat, Meter-set, Handlebars, Pillion backrest, Headlight, signal lights, Foot pegs etc. on the later generation UCE Thunderbird models would be replaced with a larger 20 litre tank. The later models would also have an 18 inch rear wheel as compared to, the 19 inch rear wheel on the old Thunderbird. Later generation models would consist of the UCE engines as per BS3,BS4,BS6 Emission norms. A model of the Royal Enfield Thunderbird with the UCE engine called the Royal Enfield Thunderbird X would have changes to the rider triangle position. Thunderbird 350 and 500 Royal Enfield Thunderbird UCE Model In October 2012, Royal Enfield launched the new 350 cc and 500 cc variants of the Thunderbird with a facelift. It features front and rear disc brakes, a teardrop shaped fuel tank, a split seat, digital speedometer console and fuel gauge, projector headlamps, LED tail lights and various cosmetic improvements over the 350 cc. Thunderbird 500 gets fuel injection system while Thunderbird 350 operates on carburetor.Later, in 2020 Thunderbird 500 cc is now discontinued. In 2018, another model was released named Thunderbird X in 350 and 500 cc with included ABS(Anti-Lock Braking System) .

It was raised in 1940 from the ranks of the existing independent companies. Operationally they carried out a series of small scale cross channel raids and spearheaded the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. They were then sent to the India as part of the 3rd Commando Brigade and took part in operations in the Burma Campaign. During the Second World War, only eight commandos were recipients of the Victoria Cross; two of the eight were from No. 1 Commando. After the war they were sent to reoccupy Hong Kong before being amalgamated with No. 5 Commando to form No. 1/5 Commando. The amalgamated No. 1/5 Commando was disbanded in 1947. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory,Chappell, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p.8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell, p.6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew, p.48 Each commando would number around 450 men commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman, p.12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p.12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman, pp.84‚Äì85 Formation A soldier from No. 1 Commando climbs up a steep rock face during training at Glencoe, Scotland, 19 November 1941. The men for No. 1 Commando were all originally from the disbanded No. 6 and No. 8 Independent Companies and formed the commando on 13 June 1940. Then on 27 July 1940 the commando became part of No. 1 Special Service Battalion. It was reformed as No. 1 Commando again 5 March 1941 and stationed in Dartmouth. For a raiding force the normal British Army regimental or battalion structure was deemed unsuitable, so the commandos devised a new structure. This new structure would not have any heavy weapons or motor transport attached and would consist of a small headquarters of six officers, four senior Non-commissioned officers, 23 other ranks and eight men attached from the RAMC and RAOC. The commando initially consisted of 10 troops each of 50 men and was commanded by a captain. Each troop was divided into two sections of 24 men with a junior officer in command.Moreman, p.15 The commando had no special equipment issued: they carried small arms identical to those of other British infantry forces ‚Äì Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles, Bren light machine guns and Thompson submachine guns. The only heavy weapon issued was a Boys anti-tank rifle.Moreman, pp.12‚Äì13 In 1943, No. 1 Commando also came under command the 3rd Special Service Brigade. With the move to the 3rd Special Service Brigade the commando formation changed and now consisted of six troops one being a heavy weapons troop of nine Vickers machine guns detachments and nine 3 inch Mortar detachments.Moreman, p.26 The five other fighting troops had also changed and now consisted of a small four- man headquarters and two sections of 31 men further divided into two sub- sections of 14 men. Operations Compared to the other commando formations, No. 1 Commando got off to a late start. It had to wait for its men to arrive from the independent companies, who continued to guard the British coastline in the face of a potential German invasion. Moreman, p.13 Operations No.1 Commando participated in included Operation Chopper, a raid on the French coast on the night of 27/28 August 1941. There followed Operation Myrmidion, a raid on Bayonne over the period of 2‚Äì7 April 1942 which was eventually aborted. The commando next supplied a troop for the St. Nazaire Raid, a successful attack on the heavily defended docks of St. Nazaire in France on the night of 28 March 1942. During the raid Sergeant Thomas Frank Durrant won the Victoria Cross. The award was unique: he is the only soldier to receive the Victoria Cross for a naval action, and in that it was recommended by the enemy. The commando then withdrew from raiding operations to prepare for the Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942. During Operation Torch No. 1 Commando became the first unit to wear the commando green beret. During the Tunisia Campaign the commando got involved in first battle of Sedjenane between February and March 1943. After a short stay regrouping in England the command sailed for India. From September 1944 it fought as part of 3 Commando brigade in Burma and the Arakan. One notable engagement was battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Kangaw became one of the most intense battles of the whole Burma campaign and during the fighting Lieutenant George Arthur Knowland earned the commando's second Victoria Cross. In March 1945 the commando withdrew back to India to prepare for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya. The war ended before the Zipper landing could take place, and the commando went to liberate Hong Kong instead. Disbandment Following the end of the war, No. 1 Commando undertook garrison duties in Hong Kong. As the demobilisation process occurred, the unit's numbers began to dwindle and it was amalgamated with No. 5 Commando.Chappell, p.46 In 1946 the decision was made to disband the Army commandos and subsequently the 3 Commando Brigade became a formation of the Royal Marines, which continues to exist today.Chappell, p.31 As a result, No. 1/5 Commando was formed on 23 March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947. Victoria Cross recipients Sergeant Thomas Frank Durrant Victoria Cross citation: > For great gallantry, skill and devotion to duty when in charge of a Lewis > gun in HM Motor Launch 306 in the St Nazaire raid on 28 March 1942. Motor > Launch 306 came under heavy fire while proceeding up the River Loire towards > the port. Sergeant Durrant, in his position abaft the bridge, where he had > no cover or protection, engaged enemy gun positions and searchlights ashore. > During this engagement he was severely wounded in the arm but refused to > leave his gun. The Motor Launch subsequently went down the river and was > attacked by a German destroyer at 50 to 60 yards range, and often closer. In > this action Sergeant Durrant continued to fire at the destroyer's bridge > with the greatest of coolness and with complete disregard of the enemy's > fire. The Motor Launch was illuminated by the enemy searchlight, and > Sergeant Durrant drew on himself the individual attention of the enemy guns, > and was again wounded in many places. Despite these further wounds he stayed > in his exposed position, still firing his gun, although after a time only > able to support himself by holding on to the gun mounting. After a running > fight, the Commander of the German destroyer called on the Motor Launch to > surrender. Sergeant Durrant's answer was a further burst of fire at the > destroyer's bridge. Although now very weak, he went on firing, using drums > of ammunition as fast as they could be replaced. A renewed attack by the > enemy vessel eventually silenced the fire of the Motor Launch, but Sergeant > Durrant refused to give up until the destroyer came alongside, grappled the > Motor Launch and took prisoner those who remained alive. Sergeant Durrant's > gallant fight was commended by the German officers on boarding the Motor > Launch. This very gallant non-commissioned officer later died of the many > wounds received in action. Lieutenant George Knowland Victoria Cross citation: > In Burma on 31 January 1945, near Kangaw, Lieutenant Knowland was commanding > the forward platoon of a Troop positioned on the extreme North of a hill > which was subjected to very heavy and repeated enemy attacks throughout the > whole day. Before the first attack started, Lieutenant Knowland's platoon > was heavily mortared and machine gunned, yet he moved about among his men > keeping them alert and encouraging them, though under fire himself at the > time. When the enemy, some 300 strong in all, made their first assault they > concentrated all their effects on his platoon of 24 men but in spite of the > ferocity of the attack, he moved about from trench to trench distributing > ammunition, and firing his rifle and throwing grenades at the enemy, often > from completely exposed positions. Later, when the crew of one of his > forward Bren guns had all been wounded, he sent back to troop Headquarters > for another crew and ran forward to man the gun himself until they arrived. > The enemy was then less than 10 yards from him in dead ground down the hill > so in order to get a better field of fire, he stood on top of the trench, > firing the light machine gun from his hip and successfully keeping them at a > distance until a Medical Orderly had dressed and evacuated the wounded men > behind him. the new Bren Gun team also became casualties on the way up and > Lieutenant Knowland continued to fire the gun until another team took over. > Later, when a fresh attack came in he took over a 2 inch Mortar and in spite > of heavy fire and the closeness of the enemy, he stood up in the open to > face them, firing the mortar from his hip and killing six of them with his > first bomb. When all bombs were expended he went back through heavy grenade, > mortar and machine gun fire to get more, which he fired in the same way from > the open in front of his platoon positions. When those bombs were finished > he went back to his own trench and still standing up fired his rifle at > them. Being hard pressed and with the enemy closing in on him from only 10 > yards away, he had no time to re-charge his magazine.

The act received Royal Assent on 4 December 2001. On 14 January 2001 the British government passed The Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001 to amend the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 by extending allowable reasons for embryo research to permit research around stem cells and cell nuclear replacement, thus allowing therapeutic cloning. However, on 15 November 2001, a pro-life group won a High Court legal challenge, which struck down the regulation and effectively left all forms of cloning unregulated in the UK. Their hope was that Parliament would fill this gap by passing prohibitive legislation. Parliament was quick to pass the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 in order to explicitly prohibit reproductive cloning. The remaining gap with regard to therapeutic cloning was closed when the appeals courts reversed the previous decision of the High Court. The act was repealed and replaced by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.

Waterhouse : , Contemporary Music Studies 17 (Amsterdam: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1999), , pp. 7 et seq. Born in Milan, Malipiero was the son of cellist Riccardo Malipiero (1886‚Äì1975). He studied piano and composition at Milan Conservatory (in 1930), where he graduated in 1932, and Turin Conservatory, where he obtained a diploma in 1937. He pursued further studies in composition with his uncle Gian Francesco Malipiero in Venice. From 1935 to 1947 he was a lecturer at the Liceo Musicale \\"Vincenzo Appiani\\" in Monza. Malipiero was active as a pianist, and also wrote criticism for Il popolo and Corriere lombardo, from 1945 to 1966. He lectured in the United States in 1954, 1959, and 1969, and in Buenos Aires in 1963. Between 1969 and 1984 he directed the Varese Conservatory, in which he joined the music faculty in 1979. Malipiero's early works were composed using a free atonality. In 1945 he began using a twelve-tone technique in his compositions, becoming one of the pioneers of that technique in Italy. He promoted the twelve-tone technique in articles he contributed in Italian music periodicals, books, and lectures. In 1949 he organized the First Congress of twelve-tone music in Milan which was attended by such important composers as John Cage, Luigi Dallapiccola, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Ren√© Leibowitz, Bruno Maderna, and Camillo Togni. In 1969 he represented Italy at UNESCO's 7th Congress in Moscow. Malipiero died in Milan in 2003 at the age of 89. References Further reading * Bernardoni, Virgilio. 2001. \\"Malipiero, Riccardo\\".

The last years were merged into Freshwater Senior Campus. Closure In June 2000, the Department of Education and Training announced that the school would close because of falling enrolments. Following the announcement, local residents formed a committee to prevent the closure, and later to prevent a Government sale of the school site and make the site available for the community, known as the Retain Beacon Hill High School Committee. The closure of the school was criticised by the Greens New South Wales Education spokesman, John Kaye, who said in a media release: \\"The demolition of Beacon Hill High School is a monument to poor planning, developer-driven government decisions and a deceitful and inadequate closure process.

From 1834 to 1978, RSS Presidents had always been nominated and returned unopposed. In 1978 however there had been a lot of opposition when Council arranged for Sir Campbell Adamson to stand for Council, on the understanding that he would stand for and become President the following year. However, for the first time in living memory there was an election for Council, and Campbell Adamson came last out of a 25 candidates. (There were 25 candidates and 24 place on Council.) Despite this, Campbell Adamson was put up for President, and Wynn was nominated as an alternative candidate. Although Wynn was relatively unknown at the time, he won the election and completed his presidency.

The Square's plate. The Square name honors an 18th-century politician that prompted P√≥voa de Varzim's urban development in the late 1700s. Pra√ßa do Almada (Almada's Square) is the civic center of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim in Portugal, and is located in P√≥voa de Varzim City Center. It contains the sculpture that pays homage to E√ßa de Queiroz, a notable writer who was born there. Pra√ßa do Almada is about in area. It is considered by the city as free space and part historical area of P√≥voa de Varzim district. In 1791, by the royal provision of Queen Mary I, the old Campo da Cal√ßada became the civic center, initially named Pra√ßa Nova, or the New Square in English. It was also the place where the first public garden of P√≥voa de Varzim was raised, and popular amongst the 19th century bourgeoisie. A legend speaks of a white owl that flies on the square between eleven thirty p.m. and midnight, which is associated with the incarnation of the soul of a person that deeply loved this square and did not want to ever leave it. History =16th century: The Cal√ßada= The Cal√ßada or Pavement was one of the exits of the urban core of P√≥voa de Varzim in the 16th century, at the time the town was centered on Pra√ßa Velha, the Old Square. The toponym was assigned to ways, in the North of Portugal, that were paved where it was necessary. To the west, the Cal√ßada ended next to the Town's Pillory of the 1514 Royal Charter by King Manuel I, that Fl√°vio Gon√ßalves points out the construction in the reign of King John III, a period of local development. On the Pillory site the development of the Street of the Blacksmiths (Rua dos Ferreiros) was initiated in 1568. =18th century: Pra√ßa Nova as the new civic center= In time, the field of the Cal√ßada became the town's Market square. The development of P√≥voa de Varzim as an important fishery community in the 18th century prompted the royal provision by Queen Mary I. Forwarded by the queen on February 21, 1791, ordering Corregedor Francisco de Almada e Mendon√ßa (the Almada) to reorganize the urbanization of P√≥voa de Varzim, namely the creation of a new square in the old market square and substituting the diminished Old Square as the civic center. It was an area already delimited just north of the Cal√ßada. The royal representative, lieutenant colonel Frenchman Reinaldo Oudinot, to the corregedor, ordered that \\"That in the Field of the Cal√ßada there should be built a wide square for the markets and other streets and in this Square porch houses should be built , trees, and a fountain in the middle, everything in conformity with Colonel Lieutenant's plant\\". Work started in the year 1793 and, shortly after, became the new economic center of P√≥voa de Varzim where the markets and fairs had been transferred. As such, in 1800 it was determined: \\"No-one can buy or sell firewood nor any other sorts of goods except on the Pra√ßa Nova of this town where all goods must be put on sale in order to be bought by who wants it.\\" The 19th-century garden. Around 1880, Pra√ßa do Almada was a stop for streetcars. 1906 E√ßa de Queiroz birthplace commemoration. The square also linked the former civic center, the now Neighbourg of Matriz, to the streets of the bustling fishing neighborhood of Junqueira. In the 18th century the main street was mostly settled by fishermen and the main fishing street of the town. Then the New square later came to be known as the Pra√ßa Nova do Almada or Almada's New Square, in honor to the corregedor, for having been one of the main boosters of the Royal Provision by Queen Mary I. The meeting and leisure usefulness of the square was favored by the raising of the arches of the new town hall building, as it protected people from the weather. The new city hall, which was occupied in 1807, turned the new square into the political hub of the town. =19th century: The public garden = Pra√ßa do Almada also had the intention of being a public garden, trendy in the 19th century, to be used by the high bourgeoisie. A proper market square was constructed in May 1873, with an elegant fountain in cast iron. However, it was considered that the daily market removed dignity to the civic center and a new market square was inaugurated in Pra√ßa do Marqu√™s de Pombal square in 1904, and the fountain transferred to Dores Square, today in the garden of the Senhor do Monte street. The first efforts to build a gazebo occurred in 1896. It was an ephemeral structure, given that the current Art Nouveau iron-cast gazebo was constructed at the site in 1904. This gazebo was inaugurated in 1905 with a play by the Povoense Band.As Prociss√µes na P√≥voa de Varzim (1900‚Äì1950). Volume 1 - Deolinda Carneiro, Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto. 2006 The stage became not only a hub for plays and concerts, but also for meetings and debates.Coreto da Pra√ßa do Almada - IGESPAR E√ßa de Queiroz was born in Pra√ßa do Almada in 1845, in the old number 1 of Pra√ßa do Almada, house that opens up on S√£o Sebasti√£o square, currently named E√ßa de Queiroz Square due to this event. Carolina, his mother, dated Teixeira de Queiroz to whom became pregnant, to hide the pregnancy, Carolina moves to the house of her sister, Augusta Pereira d' E√ßa where the child was born. In 1906, to celebrate the birth of one of the greatest writers in the Portuguese language,E√ßa's English Letters - The Guardian a crowds gathers around the house, and a bronze plate, by Master Teixeira Lopes, is placed. The plate was offered by the Portuguese of Brazil. The original house was controversially rebuilt in early 20th century, but the plate saved and placed on the newly built house. Urban morphology The City Hall with the 1790-1791 arches by French engineer Reinaldo Oudinot. The square is landscaped in an egg-shape, cut in half by the National Highway 13, and is tipped by buildings with long-established national style. The building of the City Hall (1791), located in the north section, dominates the square and is of neoclassical design in the taste of the English settlement in Porto. This English influence is visible in the arches of ashlar masonry on the ground floor, with tiling, to the Portuguese taste, added in 1908-10 by Rocha Peixoto, of the authorship of the Belgian painter Joseph Bialman. In front of the city hall, the square's ground has drawings with the blazon of the city and some siglas poveiras, considered of cultural interest and kept after the latest square rearrangement in 2007. Statue of E√ßa de Queiroz in the square's east end. Pra√ßa do Almada with the City's Main Church, located in the Old Square, visible in the background. To the west of the square is the Manueline pillory of P√≥voa de Varzim, erected in 1514. It is a national monument and represents the municipal emancipation of P√≥voa de Varzim. In front and in another part of the square, there's the Statue of E√ßa de Queir√≥s, erected in 1952. It is of the authorship of Master Leopoldo de Almeida. The monument was offered by Povoan settlers in Rio de Janeiro. Next to the pillory, the square's historical and romantic gazebo follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time. With hexagonal plant, the gazebo is an illustration of cast iron architecture, with a very noticeable oriental influence, despite being stylized and geometric. Pra√ßa do Almada is a hub for different city districts. Through the streets of Sousa Campos and the Junqueira shopping streets, one can reach the waterfront. Through the streets of Paulo Barreto and Gomes de Amorim, the northern and densely urbanized area of the city is reached. E√ßa de Queiroz Square, Pra√ßa do Almada has direct access to Bairro da Matriz, the most traditional quarter, and through to Ferreiros Street, a road from the 16th century that until the 19th century was used to get to Vila do Conde and Porto, links the main square to the notorious fishing neighborhood known as Bairro Sul. =Listed heritage= According to Plano de Urbaniza√ß√£o da P√≥voa de Varzim:Relat√≥rio do Plano de Urbaniza√ß√£o da P√≥voa de Varzim (in Portuguese) ‚Äî CMPV, Departamento de Gest√£o Urban√≠stica e Ambiente *Pra√ßa do Almada (free space with patrimonial importance). *Pelourinho - Pillory of P√≥voa de Varzim *Gazeto of Pra√ßa do Almada *P√≥voa de Varzim City Hall *Old Hotel Universal *E√ßa de Queiroz House *S√£o Sebasti√£o Fountain *Cruzeiro verde - Calvary References Category:Squares in P√≥voa de Varzim ","title":"Pra√ßa do Almada"},{"id":"27063931","text":"Ochyrotica is a genus of moths in the family Pterophoridae and only genus in the Ochyroticinae subfamily.

It tells the story of Frank Darbo, a short-order cook who becomes a superhero without having any superhuman ability, calling himself the \\"Crimson Bolt\\". He sets out to rescue his wife Sarah from the hands of a drug dealer. The film premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in theaters in the United States on April 1, 2011 and on video on demand on April 13, 2011. The film was released unrated in U.S. theaters, and later received an R rating for its DVD/Blu-ray release. Upon release, Super received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $590,000 against a budget of $2.5 million, making it Gunn's lowest-grossing film. Plot Short-order cook Frank Darbo recalls his only two good memories from a disappointing life; marrying his wife, Sarah, and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a public-access television show (based on the actual Christian superhero series, Bibleman), who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose. Frank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the store clerk, Libby. Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of \\"The Crimson Bolt\\". Armed with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from drug dealers and child molesters to a man who cuts in line at the movies. The Crimson Bolt soon becomes a media sensation. Initially, the media view him as a violent psychopath, but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. Frank later attempts to rescue Sarah at Jacques' house, but Jacques' thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees while climbing over a fence. A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolt's \\"kid sidekick\\", christening herself \\"Boltie\\" and designing a costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to nearly kill a man who possibly vandalized her friend's car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques' thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored of Frank, but he turns down her advances, insisting that he is still married. Arguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby rapes Frank while the two are in costume. Frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of Sarah in the toilet. He decides that it is time to rescue her from Jacques. Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques' ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. However, they are both shot. Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is shot in the head and killed. Devastated by her death, Frank goes into a rage, slaughtering all of Jacques' thugs. Inside, Jacques shoots Frank, but Frank gains the upper hand and stabs Jacques to death as Sarah watches, horrified. Frank takes her home, and she stays for a few months \\"out of a sense of obligation\\" for saving her life, Frank surmises. However, she leaves him again. This time, she manages to overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems. She remarries and has four children. Frank is convinced that her children will change the world for the better. Frank, now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories. The wall is covered with pictures of his experiences from his time spent with Libby and pictures of Sarah's kids, who call him \\"Uncle Frank\\". Frank looks at Libby's picture, and a tear runs down his cheek.

Super was filmed between December 9, 2009, and January 24, 2010, in Shreveport, Louisiana, with additional shooting at director James Gunn's home in Los Angeles, California (the comic book store shown in the film is a real store, ComicSmash, in Studio City). Since the film was a low-budget, independent project, everyone involved in the film was paid scale (the minimum allowed by the Screen Actors Guild). Tyler Bates worked on the soundtrack. Gunn has said in interviews that he had been working on the script for Super since 2002, but he had a hard time getting it made, as producers felt that the content was too violent and esoteric. In addition, Gunn had a hard time deciding on the right actor to play Frank; John C. Reilly was Gunn's top choice, but he wasn't considered to be a big enough star for the film to get made. After Slither was made, Gunn had effectively put the project on hold until his ex-wife Jenna Fischer encouraged him to go through with it and recommended Rainn Wilson, her co-star from The Office. Wilson read the script while on set and decided he wanted to join the film, and in turn sent the script to Ellen Page, with whom he had worked in Juno, who immediately accepted the role of Libby. Super was Gunn's second film dealing with superheroes, the first being The Specials in 2000 that he wrote, but did not direct. Gunn has said that examining superheroes from a different angle interests him, and that he may do more films concerning the subject in the future. He was later chosen to direct the 2014 Marvel Studios superhero film Guardians of the Galaxy and produce the 2019 dark superhero horror film Brightburn, in which Rainn Wilson also briefly reprises his role as Frank Darbo in photographic form indicating that Super and Brightburn are set in the same universe. Reception =Critical response= Super received mixed reviews from critics, who debated the moral ambiguity, violence and messages, but still received praise for the acting, tone, writing and humor. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 49% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 123 reviews, with an average rating of 5.52/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Super intriguing premise and talented cast are drowned in a blood-red sea of graphic violence, jarring tonal shifts, and thinly written characters.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Film4 wrote, \\"It's not that this type of movie shouldn't be made‚Äîthis type of movie could be brilliant‚Äîbut it plays like every first draft idea anyone had found its way to the screen because it made someone laugh over a few drinks ... Some really interesting ideas and the odd flash of awesomeness, but overall a big old misfire with some ill-judged nastiness.\\" Al Kratina reporting at the Fantasia Film Festival wrote, \\"There's a great movie somewhere inside James Gunn's dark comedy Super ... Super is an undeniably entertaining film. But there's something off about it ... Super is a funny film, a twisted story, and occasionally a very good movie, just rarely at the same time.\\" Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"This trifle about a doofus who becomes a costumed superhero, even though he has no special powers, might have seemed funkier before Kick-Ass. Yet the movie is written and directed by James Gunn with a certain whimsical black-comic flair ... It's really a one-joke movie, but the joke is a good one: Frank's 'crusade' is just a geek's screw-loose revenge, which Wilson, digging into the character's misery, makes oddly sympathetic.\\" Conversely, Scott Weinberg of Cinematical wrote, \\"Chock full of insanely graphic violence, awash in thoroughly un-PC perspectives, and more than willing to keep on punching long after the audience is virtually incredulous, Super is fun and funny, dark and twisted, semi-schizophrenic and certifiably insane. What I liked most was its simple audacity. And Ellen Page.\\" =Box office= Super made $46,549 on opening weekend with eleven theaters, averaging $4,232 per theater, which was considered by analysts to be \\"a disappointing start\\" for the film. Conversely, the film fared better on VOD and had been anticipated to be the most successful film VOD for IFC. As of 2011, it made over $1,5 million on DVD and Blu-ray sales. During an interview actor Rainn Wilson explained his thoughts about the struggling box office performance, saying the risky tonal decision worked against the film in its limited theatrical release: \\"It is a comedy. It's also an action movie, and it's also a drama, and it's also a really [messed] up genre, cult type of film. It's all of those things at one time, and people are not used to it. They're used to like, oh, 'The Avengers' has some comedy in it, but it's action, and it's a comic-book-type thing. People really know exactly what world they're in. But in this one, it mixes so many different worlds, you're really off-balance. 'Cause you don't know if the next scene is going to be someone crying, or it's going to be ludicrous or it's going to be an animated sequence or an action sequence. You just don't know.\\" =Awards= At the 2011 Fantasia Film Festival, Super was tied with the documentary Superheroes for the AQCC Prize; \\"For two films that perfectly capture the Zeitgeist of our age and that present elaborate reflections on one of the biggest Americans trends, the AQCC Jury has awarded its best international film prize, in a tie, to the fiction film Super by James Gunn and to the documentary Superheroes by Michael Barnett, two strong and complementary works.\\" Soundtrack Music featured on the movie's soundtrack includes hit songs such as Eric Carmen's \\"It Hurts Too Much\\" and Cheap Trick's \\"If You Want My Love\\".https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/soundtrack Similarity to Kick- Ass Close to the time that Super was released, another film on the topic of amateur superheroes, Kick-Ass, was released. During the production process, Gunn, a friend of Kick-Ass creator Mark Millar, learned of the other film. In an interview after Super was released, he commented that \\"I was definitely wary of it, I was like 'This sucks! Kick-Ass is being made into a movie; is that gonna mean we're irrelevant?' But in the end the stories are so different. Our movie is about a guy who's on his own sort of spiritual quest and he just happens to wear a superhero costume during it. But it's really about the guy and not the costume.\\" Millar later defended Super in light of accusations that it was copying his work with, \\"People have said to me, 'Oh my God, he's ripping off Kick-Ass,' because it's coming out one year later, but James was doing this when I was doing Kick-Ass as well. Both projects were coming together at exactly the same time.\\" Millar went on to screen Super at his Kapow! comic convention in London. Gunn also responded to the accusations, pointing out that \\"It sucks on the one hand and then on the other hand, who gives a shit? There are 4,000 bank heist movies. We can have five superheroes- without-powers movies. What does bum me out [is] people who pretend like Kick- Ass was the first superheroes without powers movie, when that's obviously the classic John Ritter film Hero at Large.\\" Connection to Brightburn In the mid-credits scene of Brightburn which James Gunn also worked on, Crimson Bolt makes a cameo as a photograph in the possession of a conspiracy theorist blogger named the Big T (portrayed by Michael Rooker).

They are rescued by Stanley, who carries Sara back to his isolated house in a cold, wet landscape above the river. Stanley puts Sara to bed and she slowly recovers. The couple wonder about their solitary host, who is a man of few words. Stanley carries on with his life, preparing food, fetching water and digging a well on the hillside below the house. As the days pass and the couple recover from their trauma, elements of their past are revealed, suggesting they are running from somewhere or something. They consider the possibility of staying long term. \\"Everything we need is here,\\" says Sara. \\"We can stop running.\\" Stanley shows a voyeuristic fascination towards the couple, particularly Sara while she is recuperating in the house. Sara talks to Stanley and he reveals some of his past. Iwan becomes jealous of this developing relationship with his girlfriend. Iwan eventually confronts Stanley outside the house and, either deliberately pushed or by accident, ends up falling down the well. Meanwhile Sara, when she attempts to wash herself in the basin, has been having unexplained flashbacks about drowning. In a final twist during the last few minutes of the film, Sara's flashback reveals the true nature of her situation. Cast * Dyfan Dwyfor as Iwan * Annes Elwy as Sara * Mark Lewis Jones as Stanley Production Talfan originally imagined the film to be without dialogue, but later conceded some talking would be required (though the first ten minutes of the film are dialogue-less). The film was shot near Tregaron in West Wales. The film crew were based for four weeks in a disused school building without any mobile phone reception, which Bryn says instilled a necessary \\"siege mentality\\". With a small budget and no pressure from big financial backers, Bryn says he was able to set about making exactly the film he wanted. Back to back versions were recorded in Welsh and in English. Much of the film was recorded using hand held cameras and natural lighting. Reception The film had its UK premiere on 10 March 2016 at the Wales One World (WOW) Film Festival in Aberystwyth, with a general release date of 8 April 2016. It had its television debut on the Welsh language channel, S4C, on 13 August 2017. The Hollywood Reporter summarised the film as containing \\"far too few jolts to appeal to garden variety horror fans. But the highbrow contingent will respond well at fests, and Bryn's quiet confidence earns him a spot on filmmaker-to-watch lists.\\" Jones is described as \\"good at using minimal cues to suggest a large interior world. It's a performance intriguing enough that one might have been content to watch Stanley spend the length of a feature interacting only with himself and his land, saying nothing aloud, in Welsh or otherwise.\\" Similarly The Guardian concludes that the \\"gradual excavation, with its spectral presences, may disappoint those who demand more bang for their buck\\", but the assured acting and melancholy feel \\"ensures it lingers longer in the mind than most homegrown genre fare\\". Based on a small number of reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes website gave The Passing a 63% approval rating. =Awards= The Passing/Yr Ymadawiad received a silver medal at both the World International Television Festival and New York Film and Television Awards. It won a Single Drama Award at the Celtic Media Festival in Dungarvan, Ireland. At the 2016 BAFTA Cymru awards Ed Talfan won Best Author award and the Best Production Design award went to Tim Dickel for Yr Ymadawiad.

A day later, the Ukrainian defense ministry announced the shooting death of a Ukrainian Naval officer in the village of Novofedorivka. The incident took place outside the Novofedorivka Air Base in the military dormitory building, which was occupied by Ukrainian servicemen and their families that were awaiting relocation to mainland Ukraine. While Ukrainian Navy major Stanislav Karachevsky of the military unit No. 1100 was preparing his belongings in preparation to leave Crimea, an altercation between him and several soldiers on both sides broke out. The scuffle escalated to where Russian Spetsnaz Sergeant Yevheniy S. Zaytsev shot the unarmed officer twice in the head and chest at point blank range with an AK-74 assault rifle on the 5th floor of the dormitory building where Russian soldiers were evacuating the troops. Major Karachevsky was pronounced dead immediately. A second Ukrainian personnel, identified as Captain Artem Yermolenko, was beaten and abducted by Russian soldiers. Russian sources confirmed the death of a Ukrainian major perpetrated by one of its sergeants, but it said that it was an incident where a group of drunk Ukrainian soldiers on their way to the sleeping quarters encountered Russian soldiers manning a checkpoint on the road to the air base where they were previously stationed. The Ukrainian armed forces says that Russian soldiers pursued the unarmed Ukrainian into the barracks, killed him, and then moved the body.

The company is based in Cranleigh, Surrey, United Kingdom. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. , more than 15% of shares were owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. History The company was established in 2006 by the acquisition of certain intellectual property rights and assets from Eneco. In 2010, it commissioned a hydrogen fuel cell named Alpha System at the Chinchilla underground coal gasification facility, operated by Linc Energy. Combining these technologies allows usage of hydrogen, produced by the underground coal gasification process, as a feedstock for the fuel cell. In August 2011, the company commissioned hydrogen fuel cell named Beta System at its facility in the United Kingdom. In October 2011, AFC Energy commissioned two Beta Systems at the AkzoNobel chlor-alkali plant in Bitterfeld, in Germany. In June 2012, AFC Energy and Industrial Chemicals Limited announced a plan to install the largest fuel cell facility in the United Kingdom with an electrical output of 1 MW. This was subsequently abandoned in 2013 in favour of deploying a large system at an Air Products facility at Stade, Germany. In September 2012, the company opened an alkaline fuel cell electrode pilot production plant in Dunsfold, Surrey. In March 2015, AFC committed to build a 50 MW fuel cell park in South Korea, as part of a joint venture with two local companies, Samyoung and Changsing Chemical. In April 2015, AFC Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with Dubai Carbon for a 300 MW fuel cell park in Dubai. However, no progress of these projects has been reported. In August 2015, AFC Energy commenced operation of its first KORE fuel cell system in Stade, Germany. In January 2016, the system reached capacity of 200 kW. In July 2018, the company agreed to install a 200‚Äì400 kW fuel cell unit at the Southern Oil's biorefinery at Gladstone, Australia. In April 2019, AFC Energy confirmed details of its new high-power density alkaline fuel cell technology. The new technology has potential use in applications where space and weight of power generation are important considerations and will sit alongside and complement its existing large-scale stationary fuel cell system. Adam Bond, Chief Executive Officer at AFC Energy, said: \\"At AFC Energy, we now have a fuel cell platform capable of delivering performance only previously seen in other membrane-based fuel cell technologies, and at lower operating temperatures. This is a major step forward in the alkaline fuel cell sector where AFC Energy continues to be at the cutting edge. The ability to license parts of this technology to non-core applications would also give rise to an additional revenue stream potential without compromising existing fuel cell market potential.\\" Through 2019 AFC altered its focus towards EV charging and partnered with Rolec. Perceived advantages of the AFC system are the ability to operate in remote off-grid areas, the ability to neutralise the constraints of grid capacity in any situation, and of course 100% carbon-free power generation. The high costs of grid connection do much to mitigate the capital costs and AFC is working on innovative capex models with clients; indeed it is felt that commercial announcements are imminent. During 2019 AFC also set about branding its products. Of particular interest are the solid electrolyte fuel cell scheduled for release in 2022, and the Alkamem membrane. The former is a high density fuel cell likely to have many applications beyond that of the traditional AFC offering. The latter is an innovative membrane with applications in multi- million dollar markets outside of fuel cells, e.g. electrolysis. A broker note dated May 2020 placed the then price target under review pending a full evaluation of AFC's current technologies and partnerships. High end clients are known to be in advanced discussion. The outlook for AFC looks bright. The political winds are favourable, with recent government announcements re funding for EV charging, and an acceptance of the green agenda both for public health reasons and to drive the post-COVID economic recovery. AFC looks set to become a significant player; it is notable therefore that its market capitalisation is some 7- 10% of other UK-listed hydrogen plays such as ITM power and Ceres Power. In June 2020 AFC entered into an agreement with Acciona, a large Spanish construction company with a multi-national presence, to demonstrate the AFC fuel cell on site. Many governments, particularly following the COVID crisis, are looking to mitigate the environmental effects of construction, especially particulate pollution; many have already legislated. The AFC fuel cell provides a ready solution and the deal with Acconia will be followed keenly by other construction companies. This announcement was a primary trigger to the intended share target price review. It is also notable that the previous target price attributed no value to Alkamem or to the solid fuel cell. The latter is of great potential future significance as it opens additional applications, notably shipping and trains, as mentioned by the CEO in a June 2020 interview. In July 2020 AFC Energy announced a collaboration with Extreme E to use its pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology to enable its race fleet to be charged using zero emission energy. The by-product of utilizing these hydrogen fuel cell power generators for charging, water, will be used elsewhere on-site.

Its US operations are based in Melville, New York and its European operations in Amstelveen, Netherlands. Nikon Instruments is a specialist in optical instrumentation and the only microscope company to manufacture its own glass. History The company, Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'), was formed in 1917 with the merger of three Japanese optical manufacturers to produce precision optical glass. In 1925, the brand expanded to produce the first microscope with a revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives ‚Äì the Joico microscope. Over the next few decades the microscopy division introduced new polarising and stereomicroscopes, and metrology products for measuring and inspection. Nikon launched the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes in the 1970s and established the CF Optical system. In the 1980s, they released 80 new products, including the inverted Diaphot microscope, which was used in IVF techniques. The introduction of the Eclipse range of infinity optics in the 1990s was a departure from traditional microscope design. CFI60 optics have high numerical apertures (N.A.s) and long working distances, increased resolution and light-gathering capability and high performance in confocal imaging. The infinity optical system also has the benefit that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece tube is not fixed, allowing a variety of imaging modules to be inserted into the light path without any compromise in optical quality. This has allowed microscopes to be used as versatile imaging workstations that provide users with instant access to several imaging methods. Using a Nikon Diaphot microscope, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. Nikon has introduced a series of digital camera systems optimized for microscopy-based applications enabling the digital transfer of images. Products Alongside developments in inter-disciplinary, clinical and confocal microscope solutions, Nikon's digital imaging technologies and software solutions support all microscopy and imaging functions, image management and analysis. The Eclipse Ti series of inverted microscopes allow the simultaneous mounting of confocal, TIRF module and multiple stacked epi- fluorescence filter turrets to make this microscope function as a live cell imaging platform. Long term timelapse imaging of living cells is possible in the BioStation series. Nikon partnered with OptraSCAN for accelerating adoption of digital pathology systems and solutions in North America. Nikon's N-SIM microscopy system can produce two times conventional resolution by combining Structured Illumination Microscopy technology licensed from UCSF based on Nikon's Eclipse Ti research inverted microscope. N-STORM is a new super-resolution microscope system that combines ‚ÄúStochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy‚Äù technology (licensed from Harvard University) and Nikon's Eclipse Ti, providing resolution that is 10 times greater than that of conventional optical microscopes.

The objectives of the GMC are to: * unite and coordinate organisations and people to influence public opinion and organise collective action; * promote and support child participation; * encourage political commitments and accountability. History The children's rights movement has existed since the early years of the twentieth century when individuals, public institutions and NGOs began to unite their efforts to improve the fate of children around the world. In recent years the movement has seen a dramatic growth and gained greater coherence with the drafting and entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) passed on the 30th anniversary of the ‚ÄòDeclaration of the Rights of the Child‚Äô. Events following the adoption of the convention enhanced the significance of the movement even more, namely: * the World Summit for Children in 1990. * Gra√ßa Machel's study on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children (1996) * a series of global campaigns against landmines, child labour, sexual exploitation, and the use of child soldiers; * the GMC Convening Committee for the Say Yes for Children campaign (2000), formally established the Global Movement for Children in 2002 bringing together some of the biggest organisations working with children. * the UN General Assembly‚Äôs Special Session on Children (2002). At the UN General Assembly‚Äôs Special Session on Children in 2002 the name Global Movement for Children (GMC) was first coined. The purpose of naming the Global Movement for Children was to help make visible to the world‚Äôs leaders the thousands of organisations and millions of citizens, voters ‚Äì and children themselves ‚Äì who are today united in this cause. Nelson Mandela and Gra√ßa Machel launched the GMC at the United Nations and since then, it has brought together thousands of organisations in advocating for children rights. Over the years, the GMC has focused on the following issues: * Girl's education * Children and AIDS * Violence against children * Child survival * Children on the move and child traffic =The role of Nelson Mandela and Gra√ßa Machel in the Global Movement for Children= Nelson Mandela and Gra√ßa Machel are the patrons of the GMC, its visible spokespeople and its inspirational leaders. As the key players in the Global Movement for Children, Machel and Mandela engage political, civil society, youth, religious and other leaders in the campaign to improve the lives of children. UN General Assembly resolution regarding the GMC In 2002, the General Assembly of the United Nations agreed the following: Article 62: \\"We hereby recommit ourselves to spare no effort in continuing with the creation of a world fit for children, building on the achievements of the past decade and guided by the principles of first call for children.

Those who are marginalised, vulnerable or living in poverty are better able to understand how this affects their daily lives, and should be able to fully participate in planning and implementing solutions. Children have an active role in the GMC, mainly at the local and national levels but also at the international level. * Gender equity: girls and boys have the same rights and the CC works for the attainment of such principle. This implies an approach that is gender sensitive and that pays particular attention to the rights of girls. * Multisectoral and holistic approach: the group seeks to build partnerships with those existing national, regional and international coalitions advocating for children's rights. * Institutional and long term reform: the organisations pay attention to advocacy. They focus on lobbying for institutional change to create the conditions for the full implementation of the Convention of the Rights of the Child.

It is a long narrow rectangle which extends inland from the waterfront, at a point just north of the Royal Danish Playhouse at the base of the Kv√¶sthus Pier, now known as Ofelia Plads, until it meets Bredgade. A major renovation of the square was completed in 2016.The Garrison Church is located on the south side of the square. Amaliegade, one of the two axes on which Frederiksstaden is centered, extends from the square. The square has a central garden complex along its length with an equestrian statue of Christian X of Denmark facing Bredgade. History =18th century= C. W. Eckersberg: Sankt Ann√¶ Plads, 1801 Sankt Ann√¶ Plads was originally part of a canal which continued along present-day Bredgade and Esplanaden, surrounding Sophie Amalienborg. The Royal Naval Hospital was built by Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger on reclaimed land on the south side of the canal in 1686. It later moved to Christianshavn and the building was then used as poorhouse and later storage space. The Garrison Church was built in 1703‚Äì06. =19th century= The square was created when the canal was filled in connection with the foundation of the ambitious new Frederiksstaden district in circa 1750. Sankt Ann√¶ Plads on a ceremonial target from the Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society, 1898 The central garden complex was established in 1852. It was the result of one of the first successful initiatives of the recently founded Society for the Beautification of Copenhagen. With the establishment of the Kv√¶sthus Pier at the end of the square, the site had become a hub for the new steam ferries that had begun to operate between Copenhagen and the largest cities in the provinces. The ferry company Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab (The United Steam Ferry Companies) was from 1871 based in the former navel hospital. The building was later expanded. Sankt Ann√¶ Plads on a drawing by H.G.F. Holm from circa 1842 The company would for the next many years dominate the square with hectic activity around the clock, both with passengers and goods. Eventually first cargo ships and later also passenger boats disappeared from the area. In 2003 the Royal Naval Hospital building was acquired by the Danish Nurses' Organization which has since been headquartered in it. The neighbouring building, originally built by DFDS in 1890, has since 1871 housed the JL Foundation which owns the J. Lauritzen shipping company as well as 56% of DFDS. =20th century= Sankt Ann√¶ Plads with harbor activity in 1916 Hols√∏e's proposal for linking the western end of the square with Kronprinsessegade In 1942, it was proposed to extend Sankt Ann√¶ Plads westwards to Landegreven and onwards to Kronprinsessegade. The proposal involved the demolition of Bredgade 27-33. Another proposal would extend the square in a more northernly direction. Neither of the proposals were realized. In 2014 a major renovation began, with a scheduled completion in 2016. The stated aims of the renovation were to provide a better experience for pedestrians and cyclists, as the waterfront project of Kv√¶sthusmolen plans to draw more activity to the area. The project resulted in the removal of some of the trees that lined the center of the street, although more trees are due to be planted in their place. Notable buildings Embassy of Sweden A number of buildings on the square date from back when it was first established. These include the symmetrically arranged twin houses at No. 7‚Äì9 (1750) and the Jegind House at No. 15, which were all designed by Nicolai Eigtved who also created the masterplan for Frederiksstaden. Copenhagen Mason's Guild is headquartered in No. 7 while No. 15 houses the Embassy of Sweden. The Prince William Mansion at No. 13 was completed in 1751 by an unknown architect but has later been extended with an extra floor. No. 1-3 Slightly younger are Andreas Hallander's building at No. 10 (1785, listed) and city builder J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert's two consecutive homes at No. 5 and No. 11, built in 1796 and 1801 respectively. Other buildings are in the Historicist style that dominated Danish architecture in the second half of the 19th century. Listed in 1932, No. 1‚Äì3 was built between 1847 and 1849 to designs by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch as an extension of the Lindencrone Mansion on Bredgade. Also listed is No. 2, on the opposite corner with Bredgade, which was completed by Niels Sigfred Nebelong in 1866.

It was formed in 1999 by Michael Wootten, and between 2008 and 2011 operated local bus services under the name Tiger Line. The company became part of the Bowen Travel Group in 2011, and closed down after Bowen entered administration in 2012. __TOC__ History Woottens Luxury Travel was founded in April 1999 by father and son Nick and Michael Wootten with two coaches and a small depot in Princes Risborough. School contracts for both Oxfordshire County Council and Buckinghamshire County Council were won in the first year, and in August 1999 the company moved to a purpose-built depot in Lye Green, near Chesham. In April 2007 the operations of Westways of High Wycombe, an operator established since 1990, were acquired, increasing the amount of day trip and brochure holiday work dramatically. Also in 2007, the company was shortlisted for the Route One Coach Operator of the Year award.

The last season of excavations on the archaeological site since 2004 has identified most of the walls and the habitats of a pre-Roman oppidum, particularly highlighting the latter stages of occupation of this site before its definitive abandonment. Pech Maho was a fortified trading post occupied from the sixth century BC to the third century BC. There are observed three successive occupations, apparently discontinuous, presumably by a people called Elisycssee :fr:√âlisyques (·ºòŒªŒπœÉœçŒ∫ŒøŒπ œâŒΩ-Greek) installed at the limit of Iberians, Celts and Ligures. The site seems to be a commercial crossroads between Etruscans, Greeks, Carthaginians, and the indigenous people. The almost total destruction of the oppidum occurred at the end of the third century BC and may be linked with the Second Punic War who opposed Rome and Carthage. This war resulted in the control by Rome of eastern Iberian peninsula and western Languedoc. The catapult bullets found in the levels of destruction of the oppidum would be probative evidence. The excavations have also revealed traces of funerary rituals and animal sacrifices mixing cremation of human remains. These celebrations were probably held in honor of fallen heroes by the people who returned shortly after the destruction of the oppidum. Then the site would have received a few visits during the following decades before being completely forgotten. This period coincides with the establishment in the region of the Romans, who made Narbonne their prefecture since they will dominate Gallia Narbonensis.  Location  The oppidum is actually located on a low altitude (29m) hill on the shore of the small coastal river Berre. When it was established it was located near the mouths of the Aude and Berre, the ford of the Heraclean Lane, which then allowed to join the Italy to Iberia. The oppidum was then directly on the shore of a sea- navigable and not a lagoon separated by dry land that currently observed. It stood on a hill, providing defence, and was linked to trade routes. Location :  Discovery and excavations  The site was discovered in 1913. Its name is contemporary, the ancient name is unknown. The excavations were conducted from 1948 to 1957 (J. Campardou) from 1959 to 1974 (Y. Solier) and again since 1998 (Gailledrat, Solier). The excavations are planned until 2010. In Sigean there is a museum that brings together collections from these excavations. The site is not freely accessible to the public. It can be visited with a guide, beginning at the museum on the last Saturday of the month, off season, on Wednesday morning in July and August and on demand. Pech Maho has been listed since 1961 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Vestiges de l'oppidum de Pech de Maho It was acquired by the State in 1968.

Edward Harrison Compton (11 October 1881 - 6 March 1960) was a German landscape painter and illustrator of English descent. Biography Compton was born in Feldafing in Upper Bavaria, Germany, the second son of notable landscape painter Edward Theodore Compton. He received his early art training from his father, and after a period of study in London at the Central School of Arts and Crafts settled back in Bavaria. Like his father he was inspired by the Alps to become a mountain painter (\\"Bergmaler\\") working in both oils and watercolour. However, an attack of Polio at the age of 28 meant that he had to find more accessible landscapes to paint in Germany, England, northern Italy and Sicily. He also provided illustrations for several travel books published by A & C Black. Compton exhibited at galleries in Munich and Berlin, and also in England at the Royal Academy in London and in Bradford. He died in Feldafing in 1960. He had two sisters, both of whom were artists: Marion Compton, the flowers and still-life painter, and Dora Keel-Compton, flower and mountain painter.

History  The island was named for either Thomas or John Howell, who were early settlers in the area. The island was purchased by the Department of Conservation in 1978. The island was submerged during the Great Flood of 1993.  Geography  This is a low lying, tree-covered island in the Missouri River. When the river is about at the St. Charles gauge (about 17.8 miles downstream), the Centaur causeway, which provides land access, is flooded. The island is covered by of forest and woodland, of old fields, and of crop lands.  Recreation  The area provides a limited amount of recreational activities. Camping is permitted by boaters who are traveling the Missouri River between April 1 and September 30, so long as they camp within of the river. There is an multi-use trail on the island open to hiking and biking. Horses are not permitted on the island. =Hunting and fishing = Fishing is permitted in the Missouri River, which borders the north side of the island for , as well as the Centaur Chute.

It was also released as a single in some countries, backed by \\"Down to the Waterline,\\" as a follow-up to the band's first single from the album, \\"Sultans of Swing.\\" The single reached #28 on the Dutch charts. It also reached #54 in Australia. The song was also included on Dire Straits live album Live at the BBC and on the multi-artist compilation album More Than Unplugged. Both \\"Water of Love\\" and \\"Down to the Waterline,\\" as well as \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" were among the five songs included on Dire Straits' demo tape that the band sent to Charlie Gillett, who played the tape on his radio show leading to the band's first recording contract. It is one of four songs on side 1 of the Dire Straits album which deals with unhappy relationships, and author Michael Oldfield believes that the song is basically about the break-up of Mark Knopfler's marriage. Knofler described \\"Water of Love\\" as one of his songs that came entirely from inside himself rather than putting himself in someone else's shoes. He stated that he wrote it because \\"I was so fed up. I felt I was going no place. I could see my future stretching out in front of me long and bleak.\\" Writing in Rolling Stone, Ken Tucker used the song as an example of Knopfler's penchant for mixing clever lines with prosaic ones. Tucker gives as an example the clever line \\"I need a little water of love\\" followed by \\"You know it's evil when you're living alone,\\" which Tucker considers a silly line. Writing in Billboard, Cary Darling praised the song's lyrics but criticizes the easy listening arrangement which \\"fails to grab the listener.\\" Ronald Hawkins described it as a \\"superbly crafted [song].\\" \\"Water of Love\\" has received support from classic rock radio stations as being among the greatest classic rock songs of all time; for example in 1991 C95 ranked it as #224 all time. The Rolling Stone Album Guide commented on the \\"stark, romantic vision\\" of this song and its B-side, \\"Down to the Waterline,\\" and how that vision contrasted with the bitterness of Dire Straits songs such as \\"Sultans of Swing.\\" Several critics have commented that the song's style is reminiscent of J. J. Cale's blues approach. Others have noted country music influences. \\"Water of Love\\" is one of five songs that Knopfler's publisher made country demos of without Knopfler's approval, leading to a number of country covers of Knopfler's songs. This led to a cover version recorded by The Judds, which appeared on their River of Time album and was a single in Germany. Wynonna Judd provided a \\"nocturnal and mysterious\\" lead vocal, and Knopfler himself played guitar on the Judds' version. Los Angeles Times critic Kristine McKenna described it as a \\"haunting ballad\\" and praised Knofler's \\"languid and lovely touch\\" on guitar. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek described the song as \\"the most seductive tune\\" on River of Time and The Rolling Stone Album Guide praised Knopfler's \\"typically pungent\\" guitar solo. Alex Bollard and Lex Vandyke have also covered the song. In his book My Life in Orange, author Tim Guest recalls listening to Dire Straits' version of the song and the line \\"Water of love, deep in the ground, but there ain't no water here to be found\\" as a child hiding behind the sofa and wishing that the water of love would come to him some day. The first person narrator of Caprice Crane's first novel Stupid and Contagious references \\"Water of Love\\" as an example of a clever song that she would like to hear quoted instead of the sound of flushing toilets, along with AC/DC's \\"Big Balls,\\" ZZ Top's \\"Tush,\\" Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or Frank Sinatra's \\"My Way.\\" On the Dire Straits live album Live at the BBC, as an introduction to the song they are about to perform, Mark Knopfler, with his signature dead-pan humour, is heard saying, \\"Okay, well, uh, this is a song called Water of Love. It is a... a strange idea but it's maybe one that you want to think about, a lot...\\" References External links * Category:1978 songs Category:Songs written by Mark Knopfler Category:Dire Straits songs Category:1978 singles Category:The Judds songs Category:Vertigo Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Muff Winwood ","title":"Water of Love"},{"id":"27064520","text":"Deborah Vernon Buller Murphy (n√©e Drake-Brockman, previously Hackett and Moulden; 18 June 1887 ‚Äì 16 April 1965), best known as Lady Hackett or Lady Moulden, was an Australian community worker, philanthropist, and mining investor.Alexandra Hasluck (1983) 'Hackett, Deborah Vernon (1887‚Äì1965)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, pp 149‚Äì150.

On 3 August 1905, at the age of 18, she married (Sir) John Winthrop Hackett (1848-1916), who was forty years her senior. He was a newspaper proprietor, newspaper editor, and prominent Western Australian politician.Lyall Hunt (1983) 'Hackett, Sir John Winthrop (1848‚Äì1916)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, (MUP) They had a son, also named John Winthrop Hackett (later General Sir John Hackett (1910-1997) commander-in-chief of the British Army on the Rhine before becoming principal of King's College London upon retirement), and four daughters. Hackett senior died in 1916 leaving a large estate to his family, and a large endowment to the University of Western Australia. On 10 April 1918 Lady Hackett, now aged 30, married (Sir) Frank Beaumont Moulden and moved to Adelaide; she was Lady Mayoress of Adelaide 1919-1921, and became Lady Moulden in 1922. Moulden died after a cerebral haemorrhage on 8 April 1932. \\"Having no children, he helped to raise his wife's five and the three of his late brother\\".Elizabeth Kwan (1986) 'Moulden, Sir Frank Beaumont (1876‚Äì1932)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10, (MUP) In 1923 Lady Moulden became interested in tantalite, a rare mineral found in the Northern Territory and at Wodgina in Western Australia. Tantalite was scarce throughout the world, and the price of tantalum was enormous; she saw the wealth that it could bring to Australia, particularly if it was processed in Australia, but the government was not particularly interested in the idea. She founded Tantalite Ltd which was incorporated in 1932. In World War II her tantalum was used in developing radar; the need for it became so obvious to the previously reluctant Commonwealth government that it resumed Tantalite Ltd for the duration of the war. In 1932, the University of Western Australia conferred upon her an honorary Doctorate of Laws. The degree was awarded in absentia due to the recent death of Sir Frank Moulden. On 27 June 1936 she married Basil Buller Murphy, a barrister nine years her junior; she became known as Dr Buller Murphy. He died 10 March 1963. She died at her home, Lordello, (in Kilsyth, Victoria) on 16 April 1965 and was buried in Karrakatta cemetery, Perth. Notes Further reading * F. Alexander (1963) Campus at Crawley * B.

The first table-top roleplaying game based on Howard's works was TSR's \\"Conan Unchained!\\" (1984) for their game Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The first comic book adaptation was in the Mexican Cuentos de abuelito - La reina de la Costa Negra #8 (1952). Howard-related comic books continued to be published to the present day. Howard is an ongoing inspiration for and influence on heavy metal music. Several bands have adapted Howard's works to tracks or entire albums. The British metal band Bal-Sagoth is named after Howard's story \\"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth.\\" Film Five films have been based on Howard's works: Conan the Barbarian (1982), Conan the Destroyer (1984), both starring Arnold Schwarzenegger; Kull the Conqueror (1997), starring Kevin Sorbo; Solomon Kane (2010); and Conan the Barbarian (2011) starring Jason Momoa. Another film, Red Sonja (1985), was based on a character created by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith who had in turn based the character on a conflation of various Howard characters. A script for a third Conan film, called King Conan: Crown of Iron, was written in 2002 by John Milius. This film was to have again starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as an older Conan, now king of Aquilonia, alongside his adult son. The Wachowskis were reported as interested in producing the script but these plans were cancelled when Schwarzenegger became Governor of California in 2003. Howard himself was played by Vincent D'Onofrio in the 1996 biographical film The Whole Wide World, based on the books One Who Walked Alone and Day of the Stranger by Novalyne Price Ellis. Several further movies are in development. Conan: Red Nails, a direct-to-DVD animated version of \\"Red Nails\\" was announced in 2005. Ron Perlman was cast as Conan with Cree Summer as Valeria.Swordplay Entertainment Peter Berg was signed up in 2008 as the director of a film based on and titled Bran Mak Morn. Vultures, based on the novella \\"The Vultures of Wahpeton\\" was announced in 2006 and expected to be released in 2011. In 2003, a short film adaptation of Howard's short story \\"Casonetto's Last Song\\", directed by Brenda Dau and Derek M. Koch, was featured as an official selection of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival.\\"Casonetto's Last Song\\" at the IMDBH. P. Lovecraft Film Festival Television The first Howard adaptation was not Conan related, although all subsequent examples were. Howard's short horror story \\"Pigeons from Hell\\" was adapted for television as an episode of the anthology series Thriller airing in 1961. In the 1990s, Conan was adapted into two animated series. The first, Conan the Adventurer debuted in 1992 as a syndicated series created by Jetlag Productions, Graz Entertainment and Sunbow Productions. The second animated series, Conan and the Young Warriors, was produced by Sunbow for CBS television picked up from plot threads in the first series and was released in 1993. The second series was not a success and only lasted for 13 episodes. A live-action syndicated series, called Conan the Adventurer, was released in 1997. The series starred Ralf M√∂ller as Conan, with plot elements from the Schwarzenegger films, albeit toned down for a television audience; one 22-episode season was produced. Audio drama An Austin, Texas, based radio drama recreation troupe, the Violet Crown Radio Players, have released numerous radio-play adaptations of Howard's \\"Sailor Steve Costigan\\" stories. These were adapted by Howard biographer Mark Finn, who also played the part of Steve Costigan.Thom, Herman & Woods (Audio) LibriVox hosts several audiobooks of public domain Howard stories, including the some Breckinridge Elkins and Solomon Kane stories in addition to Conan.All LibriVox recordings can be found at LibriVox.org and should be available on Wikimedia Commons. All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain. New Zealand based non-profit audio drama group Broken Sea Audio Productions have recorded several Howard-related productions., including dramatic reading of Queen of the Black Coast and Red Nails as well as a full-cast audio drama version of Hour of the Dragon. However, in February 2009, Paradox Entertainment used New Zealand copyright laws to prevent further BrokenSea productions. Official audiobooks of the Del Rey Books are being released by Tantor Media. These include Kull: Exile Of Atlantis read by Todd McLaren, The Savage Tales Of Solomon Kane (2010) read by Paul Boehmer and The Horror Stories of Robert E. Howard read by Robertson Dean.Tantor Media In Germany, a German-language audio dramatisation of \\"Pigeons from Hell\\" (as \\"Tauben aus der H√∂lle\\") has been released by the label Titania-Medien in early 2011. The release of an audio dramatisation of \\"The Horror from the Mound\\" (as \\"Der Grabh√ºgel\\") is scheduled for release in March 2012, followed by a dramatisation of \\"Black Talons\\" (as \\"Schwarze Krallen\\") in November 2012. Computer games The first Conan computer game was Conan: Hall of Volta (1984), released by Datasoft for the Apple II and Commodore 64. This was followed by Conan: The Mysteries of Time (1991). This game was released by Mindscape, Inc. for the Nintendo Entertainment System, a Commodore 64 port by System 3. Another Conan game was released in the same year; Conan: The Cimmerian (1991) was developed by Synergistic Software and released by Virgin Interactive for Amiga and DOS computers. It was a roleplaying-style game based more on the Schwarzenegger films rather than the original Howard material. Two Conan-based third-person action games were released in the early 21st century. The first, Conan (2004), by TDK Mediactive for Windows and consoles, was only released in Europe. The second, also called Conan (2007), by THQ and Nihilistic for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, had a wider release. The Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures was developed by Norwegian company Funcom and released in 2008 by Eidos Interactive on PC. The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic, with a metascore of 80.Metacritic Seth Schiesel, writing for The New York Times, felt that the development of the game would have benefited from a few extra months of production. However, he went on to state that the game had \\"at least the potential to become the best new massively multiplayer game since World of Warcraft.\\" Role-playing games In tabletop role-playing games, the first Howard adaptation was again a Conan property. In 1984, TSR released two movie tie-in modules for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Conan Unchained! (by David Cook) and Conan Against Darkness! (by Ken Rolston). These were so successful that TSR released a separate game, Conan Role-Playing Game, in 1985, followed by three modules: Conan the Buccaneer (by Kim Eastland), Conan the Mercenary (Eastland) and Conan Triumphant (by William Carlson). TSR also released three Endless Quest books: Conan the Undaunted (by James M. Ward), Conan and the Prophecy (by Roger E. Moore) and Conan the Outlaw (Moore). In 1986, Steve Jackson Games released its GURPS generic system and two years later, in 1988, acquired a license for a Conan role-playing game. In that same year its first Conan publication was the solo adventure Conan: Beyond Thunder River, written by W. G. Armintrout. As with the TSR game, this proved popular enough so that SJ Games released GURPS Conan, written by Curtis Scott and first published in 1989, a core rulebook constituting a GURPS standalone supplement by its own. Also in 1989, SJ Games continued publishing solo adventures with titles that completed the line started in 1988 by Conan: Beyond Thunder River: Conan: Moon of Blood (Armintrout, 1989), Conan: The Wyrmslayer (Armintrout, 1989) and Conan and the Queen of the Black Coast (Robert Traynor, 1989). After having acquired a Conan license in 2003, the British editor Mongoose Publishing released Conan: The Roleplaying Game in January 2004, a game mainly written by Ian Sturrock.Ian Sturrock, Paul Tucker, Harvey Barker and Vincent Darlage, Conan: The Roleplaying Game, Mongoose Publishing, Swindon (England), 1st Edition: January 2004, cover art by Chris Quilliams, map by Jes√∫s Barony, inner illustrations by Andrew J.

Multiple supplements were released for this game. Pinnacle Entertainment Group released Savage World of Solomon Kane in 2007, written by Paul Wade-Williams and Shane Lacy Hensley. This game was based on the company's Savage Worlds game system. Other games In other gaming, Comic Images released the Conan Collectible Card Game (2006) designed by Jason Robinette. Fantasy Flight Games released the Age of Conan (2009) strategy board game, depicting warfare between the Hyborian nations. Comic books The first comic book adaptation of a Howard story was the feature La reina de la Costa Negra (taken from the original Conan story, Queen of the Black Coast) in the miniature-size Mexican anthology title Cuentos de Abuelito #8 (1952) published by Corporacion Editorial Mexicana, SA. The series features the main characters, Conan and B√™lit, though Conan is depicted as a blonde rather than black-haired. Issues 8 through 12 adapted the original Howard story, while subsequent issues featured original material. The feature ran in nearly every issue of Cuentos de Abuelito up through number 61. \\" A digest-sized standalone La reina de la Costa Negra series was published by Ediciones Mexicanas Asocidas in 1958-1959 which lasted for at least eleven issues. In 1965-66 Ediciones Joma published a standard- size La reina de la Costa Negra comic that ran for at least 53 issues. The first English-language comic book adaptation of a Howard story was in Star Studded Comics #14 (December 1968) which adapted \\"Gods of the North\\" (otherwise known as the Conan story \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter\\"). Both Howard and H.P. Lovecraft were tremendous influences for Mike Mignola and his Hellboy series. Music Italian metal band \\"Domine\\" at the Heineken Jammin' Festival 2007. The band is one of several to have released Howard-inspired tracks. Howard is an ongoing inspiration for and influence on heavy metal. Domine's album Emperor of the Black Runes (2003) includes the Conan-inspired \\"Aquilonia Suite.\\" Italian metal band Rosae Crucis released the concept album Worms of the Earth (2003) which is entirely based on Howard's Bran Mak Morn story of the same name. Ironsword's album Return of the Warrior (2004) includes \\"Nemedian Chronicles\\" and \\"Way of the Barbarian.\\" Greek metal band Battleroar's Age of Chaos (2005) includes two Conan inspired tracks, \\"Tower of the Elephant\\" and \\"The Sword of Crom.\\" Manilla Road have recorded several Howard-related tracks across multiple albums, including \\"Queen of the Black Coast\\" (Metal, 1982); \\"Road of Kings\\" and \\"Hour of the Dragon\\" (Open the Gates, 1985); \\"The Books of Skelos\\" (The Courts of Chaos, 2001); and a trilogy based on \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter\\" - \\"Riddle of Steel,\\" \\"Behind the Veil\\" and \\"When Giants Fall\\" (Gates of Fire, 2005). French band Mad Minstrel have similarly released multiple tracks over different albums, all based on Howard's poetry, including \\"The Gates of Nineveh\\" and \\"The Riders of Babylon\\" (Fallen Cities, 2001); \\"Black Chant Imperial,\\" \\"To a Woman\\" and \\"Which Will Scarcely be Understood\\" (Prelude To Hate, 2003). The British metal band Bal- Sagoth is named after Howard's story \\"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth.\\" Bal-Sagoth have no individual tracks based on Howard's work but instead incorporate Howardian themes into their music. Vocalist and writer Byron Roberts has said \\"Howard and Lovecraft were powerful inspirations for me when I was coming up with the concept and thematic basis for this band. I wanted to create songs, which were infused with the dark essence of the 1930s pulp fantasy, which I love so much, creating my own baroque fantasy world within which all the band's songs would take place. And in tribute to those classic works of literature and that enduring, oft-maligned genre, I decided to call the band Bal-Sagoth.\\" Stage shows Based on the success of the 1982 film, Universal created a live-action show, The Adventures of Conan: A Sword and Sorcery Spectacular, that ran from 1983 to 1993 at Universal Studios Hollywood. Produced at a cost of $5 million, the 20-minute show featured action scenes executed to music composed by Basil Poledouris. The show's highlights were pyrotechnics, lasers, and an tall animatronic dragon that breathed fire. In 2013, the first dramatic on-stage version of 'Conan the Barbarian' - a Play based on the stories of Robert E.Howard - made its premiere in Tasmania, Australia. The Play, presented by Stephen Beckett Productions, featured four of Howard's characters - Conan, Valeria, Zorathus and Tascela - and incorporated live sword-fighting. In 1985, Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force filmed their first video on the set of The Adventures of Conan, making use of the pyrotechnics and other effects, as well as adding some of his own. The video was for the single \\"I'll See the Light\\" from their album \\"Marching Out\\". Footnotes =Notes= =References= =Sources=  This interview was originally published in     Category:Robert E.

It remains a relatively unpublicized development because of high levels of secrecy surrounding the project. Design The tank was fitted with cutting-edge systems and structural solutions, losing many of the traditional shortcomings of Soviet tanks. Originally the design was intended to be only a temporary solution before the development of new combat platforms. Object 187 was a parallel project to Object 188, the T-90 tank. It was based on the T-72B, with a heavily modified turret. A particularly notable feature was the rejection of the T-64 hull design. The redesigned layout took up more space, but positively affected ergonomics and protection from the glacis plate. Due to lengthening of the hull's nose section, the driver's position was lower, with his optics attached to the roof of the hull, unlike in the T-64 and its derivatives. This remedied a notorious weak spot of the T-64 design - the section between the turret and the hull. The same solution made it possible to arrange armouring at more rational angles of inclination as a countermeasure to modern sub-caliber armour-piercing rounds. The tank was fitted with a new welded turret, unlike traditional cast ones, fabricated using steel Rolled Homogenous Armour (RHA). Work on the welded turrets of Object 187, Object 188 (T-90) and the future T-80UD was carried out practically simultaneously. The turret of Object 187 was characterized by an imposing overall size, especially in the rear section. The 902A \\"Tucha\\" grenade launcher was fitted for deploying smoke and aerosol screens, and snorkel equipment was also installed. Several types of power plants and transmissions were tested on the different modifications, including a gas turbine engine. The most promising of the power plants in the course of tests proved to be the 1200 hp –ê-85-2 engine. It was installed in a longitudinal configuration, similar to the T-34. A new undercarriage and hydraulic shock absorbers substantially increased dynamic abilities.–¢–∞–Ω–∫ \\"–û–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç 187\\" (in Russian) =Main armament= During testing some of the Object 187 prototypes were fitted with the 125 mm 2A46M smoothbore gun of the T-80B. Planned primary armament of the tank though was the ballistically improved 125 mm 2A66 (also known as D-91T) smoothbore gun. Together with the tank gun, a new uranium-cored sub-caliber armor-piercing APFSDS rounds were developed called Anker-1 and Anker-2, as well as new HEAT shells, and GLATGM missiles. The 2A66 had a different appearance to the 2A46M. A muzzle brake was installed primarily to keep a clear line-of-sight for the missile guidance system, while also decreasing effective recoil from the more powerful new gun. The barrel was strengthened, with chamber volume increased to accommodate the larger round and incremented charge. The tank was equipped with the most advanced fire control system of the time. Something similar began to appear more widely on tanks in the late 1990s. The 2A66 was based on the 2A46M as a transitional version between the 2A26 gun and the new generation 2A82 smoothbore gun.–≠–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π –±–æ–µ–≤–æ–π —Ç–∞–Ω–∫ \\"–û–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç 187\\" The 125 mm 2A82 was tested earlier (late 1970s) on the experimental tank Object 785. Object 785 was also tested with a 130 mm rifled gun. While Object 187 was in development work on yet another experimental tank was also in progress. This was the Object 292, armed with a much more powerful 152.4 mm rifled gun. Similar projects, mainly for up-arming, existed in Western countries. A few years prior to Object 187, the US developed the CATTB M1 variant, armed with a 140 mm gun. Some years later, Germany developed the Leopard 2-140, armed again with a 140 mm gun. Later, the Swiss developed the Pz 87-140, armed with a 140 mm gun and with additional armour. Enhancement was limited largely to armament in these programs, however, while the Object 187 was focused on an extreme level of protection, surpassing all third generation tanks even today. New generations of tanks though potentially combine or surpass Cold-War developments. The Chinese Type 99KM is an example of possible superiority, armed with a powerful 125 mm gun firing next generation kinetic rounds or precision guided missiles, and using a more effective active protection system. The Russian Object 195 prototype had a level of firepower which has not been matched by many other prospective designs, including the extremely powerful 152 mm 2A83 smoothbore gun, and a 30mm coaxial cannon. =Armour= The Object 187 used composite armour for the turret and the hull front, and RHA for the rest of the tank. The passive armour was supplemented by the new Malakhit explosive reactive armour, a prototype of the present Relikt, and by the Shtora active protection system. It also had a CBRN protection system. Maximum physical thickness of the passive armour was up to 950 mm. It possibly consisted of special materials including ceramic or high density uranium alloys. History Work on the tank was conducted by the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Machine-Building under a T-72B improvement program with an order dated June 19, 1986. Conceived as a next-generation development, it was designed to fulfil operational requirements not then met by the rest of the main battle tanks built by Uralvagonzavod. Different prototypes of Object 187 were built in three series. Each series differed significantly from the previous, clearly demonstrating the evolution of the tank. The interior differences were less significant. The first modification was a change to an 840 hp engine. The tank was equipped with the Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour. That modification was dismantled after its trials and its hull used for the third modification. The whole power plant of the tank was later used on the Object 188 (T-90). A 1000 hp engine was installed on the second modification. Trials showed a high level of protection against contemporary weapons. The first and the second prototype series were the closest in appearance to the future T-90 tank. The third modification was intended originally for diverse experiments testing for possible structural failure; it was never fully equipped. Unlike the first and second prototype series, the 3rd series had a new welded turret made out of RHA plates with a thickness of 40 mm each. The turret closely resembled those of the T-90S, T-90SA and T-90A. Their turret design was later based on the third prototype series turret, with its similar lowered driver position, etc. The tank was originally equipped with a 1000 hp engine, but as an experiment the 1250 hp gas-turbine engine and transmission of the T-80U was fitted with a corresponding change in the hydro- shock absorbers, and the result sent to trials. Trials indicated the diesel engine was superior to the gas-turbine one. An Object 187 prototype underwent complex tests for anti-nuclear defense at the Arzamas-16 nuclear center. This tank was equipped with the Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour. The fourth modification prototype was similar to the third before engine and transmission changes. It had a new, larger, welded turret. That modification was equipped with the 1200 hp –ê-85-2 engine. It also received the new Malakhit explosive reactive armour, a prototype of the present Relikt, with reaction plates made of sufficiently massive titanium plates. The fifth and sixth modifications were the most advanced. The difference between them was in the transmission. The fifth had a mechanical transmission while the sixth was using a hydro- transmission. Both modifications used the 1200 hp –ê-85-2 engine. The nose section of the hull was increased in size even more, and changed in form. Armour protection of the turret was significantly improved and it was increased in size again, reaching a width of 3.12 meters (without explosive reactive armour); the widest rear of all welded turret Soviet tanks. These modifications had the same Malakhit explosive reactive armour as the fourth modification, except that the reaction plates were made of steel instead of titanium. =Status= Uralvagonzavod undertook enormous efforts for this tank to be adopted, but in the end after successful trials proving high combat and technical potential, but the tank was not accepted in part due to old ammunition of 2A46 not being reusable by 2A66, making costs prohibitively high. Instead, the preferred project was the Object 188 (T-90), which was a symbiosis of the T-72B's hull and some of the Object 187's systems. According to its chief designer Vladimir Ivanovich Potkin, Object 187 should have become the foundation for design and production of an entire future family of Soviet tanks, and to serve as a foundation for more advanced and powerful tanks. Even today secrecy around this tank remains. Technical data about it is largely estimated. The scale model of Object 187 model No. 6 remains under wraps on the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Machine-Building premises. This model was built by employees and there is a possibility it could be transferred to the armor museum of Uralvagonzavod for storage and exhibition. Persistent requests by the armor museum of Uralvagonzavod for transfer of at least one Object 187 for restoration and display have been rebuffed. However, according to some sources, Kubinka Tank Museum plans to conduct a repair of the remaining tanks with a subsequent open demonstration.

Football career Ponting was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and made his debut for home-town club Grimsby Town, then playing in the Football League First Division, in the 1930‚Äì31 season while still a teenager. He remained with Grimsby for another five seasons, but appeared only rarely for the first team. Ponting joined Second Division club Chesterfield in the 1936 close season for a transfer fee of ¬£1,015, plus an additional ¬£200 payable if Chesterfield reached the Fourth Round of the 1936‚Äì37 FA Cup. They were drawn against Arsenal in the Third Round, and failed to progress further. He went straight into the starting eleven, and finished the season as the club's leading scorer with 26 goals, all scored in League games. But for an unfortunate occurrence, he might well have had a 27th. The Times reported \\"a curious incident in the match between Chesterfield and Burnley, which Chesterfield won 4‚Äì1. Soon after the start Ponting, the home centre-forward, shot hard for goal and appeared to be a certain scorer when the ball became deflated and failed to reach the goal.\\" In 1937‚Äì38 Ponting's goals helped Chesterfield to reach the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, in which they lost to Tottenham Hotspur only after a replay. His contribution in the League was disappointingly low, and after scoring only once from nine first-team games at the start of the next season, he moved on. Though his final appearance for the club, on 5 November 1938, did produce a goal, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Sheffield United's reserve team that ensured Chesterfield's reserves stayed top of the Central League. Ponting then signed for Lincoln City of the Third Division North, and made his debut on the following Saturday. In his only season with the club before the outbreak of the Second World War put a stop to League football, Ponting was their leading scorer, with 19 goals from just 26 League and FA Cup games, despite not having played his first game for Lincoln until mid-November, some two-and-a-half months after the start of the season. During the 1939‚Äì40 season, he played both for Lincoln and as a guest for former club Grimsby Town in the wartime competitions. Ponting died in his native Grimsby in 1960 at the age of 47.

It was first reported in 1918 by the Danish botanist Christen C. Raunki√¶r in his study on plant communities. The OFD is also known as the species-range size distribution in literature.  Bimodality  A typical form of OFD is a bimodal distribution, indicating the species in a community is either rare or common, known as Raunkiaer's law of distribution of frequencies. That is, with each species assigned to one of five 20%-wide occupancy classes, Raunkiaer's law predicts bimodal distributions within homogenous plant formations with modes in the first (0-20%) and last (81-100%) classes. Although Raunkiaer's law has long been discounted as an index of plant community homogeneity, the method of using occupancy classes to construct OFDs is still commonly used for both plant and animal assemblages. Henry Gleason commented on this law in a 1929 Ecology article: \\"In conclusion we may say that Raunkiaer's law is merely an expression of the fact that in any association there are more species with few individuals than with many, that the law is most apparent when quadrats are chosen of the most serviceable size to show frequency, and that it is obscured or lost if the quadrats are either too large or too small.\\" Evidently, there are different shapes of OFD found in literature. Tokeshi reported that approximately 46% of observations have a right-skewed unimodal shape, 27% bimodal, and 27% uniform. A recent study reaffirms about 24% bimodal OFDs in among 289 real communities.  Factors  As pointed out by Gleason, the variety shapes of OFD can be explained, to a large degree, by the size of the sampling interval. For instance, McGeoch and Gaston (2002) show that the number of satellite (rare) species declines with the increase of sampling grains, but the number of core (common) species increases, showing a tendency from a bimodal OFD towards a right-skewed unimodal distribution. This is because species range, measured as occupancy, is strongly affected by the spatial scale and its aggregation structure, known often as the scaling pattern of occupancy. Such scale dependence of occupancy has a profound effect on other macroecological patterns, such as the occupancy-abundance relationship. Other factors that have been proposed to be able to affect the shape of OFD include the degree of habitat heterogeneity, species specificity, landscape productivity, position in the geographic range, species dispersal ability and the extinction‚Äìcolonization dynamics.  Mechanisms  Three basic models have been proposed to explain the bimodality found in occupancy frequency distributions. =Sampling results= Random sampling of individuals from either lognormal or log-series rank abundance distributions (where random choice of an individual from a given species was proportional to its frequency) may produce bimodal occupancy distributions. This model is not particularly sensitive or informative as to the mechanisms generating bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions, because the mechanisms generating the lognormal species abundance distribution are still under heavy debate. =Core-satellite hypothesis= Bimodality may be generated by colonization-extinction metapopulation dynamics associated with a strong rescue effect. This model is appropriate to explain the range structure of a community that is influenced by metapopulation processes, such as dispersal and local extinction. However, it is not robust because the shape of the occupancy frequency distribution generated by this model is highly sensitive to species immigration and extinction parameters. The metapopulation model does also not explain scale dependence in the occupancy frequency distribution. =Occupancy probability transition= The third model that describes bimodality in the occupancy frequency distribution is based on the scaling pattern of occupancy under a self-similar assumption of species distributions (called the occupancy probability transition [OPT] model). The OPT model is based on Harte et al.'s bisection scheme (although not on their probability rule) and the recursion probability of occupancy at different scales. The OPT model has been shown to support two empirical observations: #That bimodality is prevalent in interspecific occupancy frequency distributions. #that the number of satellite species in the distribution increases towards finer scales. The OPT model demonstrates that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy, and the distribution of species saturation coefficients (a measure of the fractal dimensionality of a species distribution) in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns commonly found in empirical occupancy distributions. Hui and McGeoch (2007) further show that the self-similarity in species distributions breaks down according to a power relationship with spatial scales, and we therefore adopt a power-scaling assumption for modeling species occupancy distributions. The bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions that is common in species communities, is confirmed to a result for certain mathematical and statistical properties of the probability distribution of occupancy. The results thus demonstrate that the use of the bisection method in combination with a power- scaling assumption is more appropriate for modeling species distributions than the use of a self-similarity assumption, particularly at fine scales. This model further provokes the Harte-Maddux debate: Harte et al. demonstrated that the power law form of the species‚Äìarea relationship may be derived from a bisected, self-similar landscape and a community-level probability rule. However, Maddux showed that this self-similarity model generates biologically unrealistic predictions. Hui and McGeoch (2008) resolve the Harte‚ÄìMaddux debate by demonstrating that the problems identified by Maddux result from an assumption that the probability of occurrence of a species at one scale is independent of its probability of occurrence at the next, and further illustrate the importance of considering patterns of species co-occurrence, and the way in which species occupancy patterns change with scale, when modeling species distributions.

The subsidiary title of Baron Cahir (also spelt Caher) in the Peerage of Ireland was first created in 1542 for Thomas Butler, who was a descendant of James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond. The title was re-created in 1583 with the unusual remainder to heirs general of the first baron, which made his great-nephews, Theobald Butler and Thomas Prendergast, co-heirs. Prendergast ceded the title to Theobald Butler, preferring that the title should follow the strict male line. The 10th Baron was created Viscount Cahir and Earl of Glengall. The titles of Viscount and Earl became extinct on the death of the second Earl in 1858. The title of Baron Cahir, which was created with remainder to heirs general, became abeyant and could potentially be claimed by descendants of Thomas Prendergast.

Situated on the Panke river, it is the city's northernmost quarter, chiefly known for its historic village centre and extended hospital premises. Geography The settlement area is located on the Barnim Plateau stretching in the northeast of the Berlin city centre up to the Oder‚ÄìHavel Canal and the Oderbruch delta. Berlin's northernmost point is at the Rieselfelder meadows, a former sewage farm transformed in a rural area, part of the Buch Forest within the Barnim Nature Park Infos on the NPB official website. Click on \\"Naturpark\\", then click on \\"Region\\"). The landscape is marked by hill chains, sandurs and small lakes such as the Bogensee. Along its border with the state of Brandenburg, Buch is surrounded by the municipalities of Wandlitz and Panketal (with the civil parishes of Zepernick, R√∂ntgental and Neu BuchNamed after Buch), both in the district of Barnim. The Berlin localities bordering with Buch in the south are Blankenfelde, Franz√∂sisch Buchholz and Karow. In Karow, a neighbourhood exists which is named Stadtrandsiedlung Buch. The quarter is centred around Berlin-Buch station on the Berlin‚ÄìSzczecin railway line and the adjacent historic village centre in the east. An extended Plattenbau housing area stretches along the railway in the south; around the centre, several large hospital and sanatorium areas were laid out in the early 19th century, built according to plans designed by Ludwig Hoffmann, with retirement homes, psychiatric institutions, and a cemetery. Many of the premises have been converted to residential areas. History The Barnim Plateau was already settled in the Mesolithic era. The village of Wendeschen Buk (\\"Wendish\\", i.e. \\"Slavic Buch\\") was first mentioned in a 1342 deed; Historical chronicles about Buch it is also documented as Buch slavica in the 1375 register of Emperor Chales IV. Probably founded by Sprevane tribes, Buch gradually became a German village during the Ostsiedlung migration, instigated by the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg from the early 13th century onwards. The linear settlement around the village church and Buch manor, parallel to the Panke river with a watermill. The Slavic affix fell into disuse during the 16th century. Devastated during the Thirty Years' War, the Buch area was quickly redeveloped under the rule of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William. The manor became am aristocratic estate, which about 1700 was inherited by the later adventurer and writer Baron Karl Ludwig von P√∂llnitz (1692‚Äì1775). In the 18th century, the manor house and the church were rebuilt in a Baroque style. In the Seven Years' War, the premises were plundered by Russian troops under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben during his Raid on Berlin in 1760. After the war, King Frederick the Great promoted sericulture for a recovery of the local economy. Then held by the Voss noble family, the fate of Julie von Voss (1766‚Äì1789), lady-in-waiting and spouse of King Frederick William II of Prussia, was perpetuated in the Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg by Theodor Fontane. In 1815 Buch was incorporated into the newly established Prussian Province of Brandenburg. The station on the Berlin‚ÄìStettin railway line was inaugurated on 26 June 1879. The manor estates were purchased from the Voss family by the City of Berlin in 1898, in order to lay out the Rieselfelder sewage area according to plans by James Hobrecht. At the same time, it became the site of several municipal hospitals designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and Martin Wagner. Buch remained a Brandenburg municipality until 1920, when it merged into Berlin with the \\"Greater Berlin Act\\". The hospital area from 1928 hosted the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research led by neurologists Oskar Vogt, C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier and biologist Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky; from 1931 it had its seat in a newly erected building designed by Carl Sattler. During the Nazi era, headed by Hugo Spatz and Julius Hallervorden from 1937/38, it played a vital role in eugenics and racist research, and also in the Aktion T4 \\"euthanasia\\" program. From 1949 to 1990 Buch was part of East Berlin. Transport The locality is served by the urban rail line S2, part of the S-Bahn, at the station of Buch. It is also traversed, at its southern borders, by the Berliner beltway (A10, known as \\"Berliner Ring\\"). Nearest exit to Buch is the n.36, \\"Berlin-Wei√üensee\\".

At almost 900,000 square feet, Meriden is Connecticut's seventh largest mall, housing over 140 shops. Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management acquired the mall in 2020. The mall's anchor stores are Dick's Sporting Goods, Best Buy, Ulta Beauty, Boscov's, Old Navy, and TJ Maxx. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Macy's and Sears. Meriden Mall is located along Interstate 691 and Connecticut Route 71, very close to the geographic center of the state. History The facility, originally built and owned by The May Department Stores Company opened in 1971. It original architecture was a two-level, dumbbell shaped shopping center with two anchor stores, the Connecticut-based G. Fox, which was also owned by The May Company chain, and JCPenney. Many of the original tenants of the mall were appropriately located to support the middle-class clientele of the Meriden and Central Connecticut area, including such iconic stores as Radio Shack, Spencer Gifts, Hickory Farms, Barricini Candy, Record World, Waldenbooks, CVS, Singer sewing machine store, a piano and organ store, a travel agency, a liquor store, and a tobacco store. The only restaurant in the main part of the mall was a Friendly's Ice Cream parlor and restaurant, though both J.C. Penney and G. Fox had restaurants located inside of their stores. The mall also featured an incline ramp-escalator in the center court. A 1993 renovation added a two-level wing anchored by a new Sears department store and also included a new food court, creating a T-shaped floor plan. Also in 1993, G. Fox parent, May Company acquired Boston based Filene's and merged the two department stores together under the Filene's name. The Meriden G. Fox store changed its name to Filene's. The Westfield Group acquired the mall in 1997. The mall was expanded again in an ambitious renovation announced in 1997. The renovation saw an extra floor area of added to the center, as well as an additional 30 stores, creating a cross-shaped floor plan.Westfield Group - Westfied America, Inc. announces Lord and Taylor to add stores to the shopping centres (19 December 1997) The new anchor, built opposite Sears, was the upscale department store Lord & Taylor, the centerpiece of the $38 million revitalization and expansion plan. In addition to its new anchor, a multistory parking garage was also built beside Sears on the end of the mall facing Lewis Avenue. The renovation was completed and officially opened in 1999. Due to the largely middle-class demographics of the Meriden area, however, Lord & Taylor announced within a few years of opening that the company did not see a future at the mall, and the store was soon closed. Westfield quickly moved to fill the vacancy by bringing two new ‚Äúbig box‚Äù anchors to the mall; Best Buy, which filled the former EbLens space, and Dick's Sporting Goods, which moved right into the empty Lord & Taylor space. Both T.J. Maxx and Old Navy ultimately opened stores at the end of this wing of the mall as well, creating four mini- anchors. In 2006, after a merger of The May Company with Federated Department Stores, the Meriden Filene's location became Macy's. On January 15, 2014, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 33 stores nationwide. The store closed in May 2014. On September 29, 2014, it was announced that Best Buy would close at the mall on November 1, 2014. However, after reaching an agreement with the mall, the company announced on October 16, 2014 that the store would be staying open at the mall. In October 2015, Boscov's opened a store in the former JCPenney space, both expanding and completely remodeling the structure. The location is Boscov's first in Connecticut and in the entire New England region. On November 8, 2018, it was announced that Sears would also be closing as part of a plan to close 40 stores nationwide. The store closed in February 2019. On January 6, 2020, it was announced that Macy's would be closing in April 2020 as part of a plan to close 125 stores nationwide.

Fifteen Serbs were arrested in December 2014 and charged with war crimes for their participation in the massacre. Background The Belgrade-Bar railway crosses into Bosnia and Herzegovina for 9 km, between the stations at Jablanica and Raca, both in Serbia. There is one station, ≈†trpci, but there are no border crossing facilities and only three trains per direction call at the station every day. The abducted passengers were taken off the train, robbed and physically abused. They were then taken to the village of Visegradska banja near Vi≈°egrad in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they were tortured and killed in a burned-out house near the river Drina. Their remains have not been found. Members of the Avengers (Osvetnici) military unit, commanded by Milan Lukiƒá, with logistical support from the Republic of Serbia, were responsible for the abductions. Of the approximately 30 suspects the only individual convicted for his role in the crime was Neboj≈°a Ranisavljeviƒá from Despotovac. He was arrested in October 1996. The Higher Court in Bijelo Polje sentenced him to 15 years in prison on 9 September 2002. The verdict was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Montenegro in April 2004. Ranisavljeviƒá was released from prison in 2011 after serving nine years of his sentence. The Commander of the Republika Srpska army's (VRS) Vi≈°egrad brigade, Luka Dragiƒáeviƒá, admitted at Ranisavljeviƒá's trial that the \\"Avengers\\" unit was part of the VRS. After the war Dragiƒáeviƒá was transferred to a position in the Yugoslav army. Amnesty International expressed concern that Ranisavljeviƒá had been made a scapegoat and that the trial was a token affair. It was alleged that Ranisavljeviƒá had been tortured in detention to force him to make incriminating statements. Senior officials in the Serbian and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) governments were alerted to the plan to abduct citizens of the FRY but no action was taken to prevent the crime. The ≈†trpci massacre and the Sjeverin massacre were part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing conducted against Bosniaks in the Sand≈æak area of Serbia that was organised and carried out under the cover of the Bosnian war. Police and judicial officials are alleged to have obstructed court proceedings against Milan Lukiƒá.

(2007). Flora of New Zealand - Menegazzia http://floraseries.landcareresearch.co.nz/pages/index.aspx The group is sometimes referred to as the tree flutes, honeycombed lichens, or hole-punch lichens. The most obvious morphological feature of the genus is the distinctive perforations spread across the upper side of the thallus. This makes the group easy to recognise, even for those not particularly familiar with lichen identification. The genus has a sub-cosmopolitan distribution (excluding Antarctica), but is concentrated in Australasia, Melanesia, and southern South America. Most species grow exclusively on trees, but some grow on rocks, moss, and/or soil. Etymology Menegazzia was described by the Veronese lichenologist Abramo Massalongo in 1854.James, P.W. and Galloway, D.J. (1992). Flora of Australia - Menegazzia http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/lichenlist/MENEGAZZIA%20Genus%20and%20Key.pdf He named it after his friend Luigi Menegazzi, who was a distinguished naturalist in his own right. Taxonomy Placement of Menegazzia within the Parmeliaceae has now been confirmed by several molecular studies.Arup, U., Ekman, S., Grube, M., Mattson, J., Wedin, M. (2007). The sister group relation of Parmeliaceae (Lecanorales, Ascomycota). Mycologia 99: 42-49. http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/abstract/99/1/42Thell, A., Feuerer, T., Karnefelt, I., Myllys, L., Stenroos, S. (2004). Monophyletic groups within the Parmeliaceae identified by ITS rDNA, Œ≤-tubulin and GAPDH sequences. Mycological Progress 3: 297-314. https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11557-006-0100-1 However, the exact position of the genus within the Parmeliaceae remains uncertain. It is unplaced within the Parmeliaceae. Previously, the morphologically similar genus Hypogymnia was thought to be the sister genus to Menegazzia, with some authors even separating these two genera into a family of their own, the Hypogymniaceae.Poelt, J. (1973). Classification. In: Ahmadjian, V., Hale, M.E. (Eds.), The Lichens. Academic Press, New York, pp.599-632./ However, no molecular phylogenies to date have supported this grouping. There are three accepted subgenera within Menegazzia: Dispora, Octospora, and Megamenegazzia.Bjerke, J.W. and Sipman, H.J.M. (2007). New species and new records of Menegazzia (Parmeliaceae, lichenized ascomycetes) from Malaysia and Indonesia. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 153: 489-499. http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117997058/abstract However, the monophyletic nature of these three groups remains unknown. Characteristics =Thallus= The thallus of Menegazzia is its most distinctive feature. It is foliose, dorsiventral, lobate, and often rosette- forming, though many species can also be irregularly spreading. It is heteromerous, that is, it contains an upper cortex, medulla, green algal layer (occupied by Trebouxia spp.), and lower cortex. The thallus can be loosely or closely attached to the substrate, depending on the species. Lobes are generally hollow and inflated, with perforations throughout the corticate upper surface. Only two species of Menegazzia are known which do not contain perforations (M. eperforata, and an as yet undescribed taxon from Papua New Guinea). Many species can be sorediate, but only a few isidiate. Maculae are often present, especially at the lobe tips. The lower surface is also corticate, naked, and often uniformly attached to the substrate (except in M. inflata). This surface is always blackened, and without rhizines. Internal cavities have walls which are most often white, but in some species they can be pigmented or blackened.Galloway, D.J. (1985). Flora of New Zealand - Menegazzia http://floraseries.landcareresearch.co.nz/pages/index.aspx =Apothecia= Rounded apothecia are produced along the lamina of most of the known Menegazzia species, while the others are thought to be entirely asexual (like M. nothofagi and M. globulifera). In the taxa that do produce apothecia, they are always lecanorine, and often cupuliform. They can be sessile, but more frequently are subpedicellate to pedicellate. The apothecial disc is concave to plane, matt to shining, or even pruinose in some taxa (like with M. dielsii), with a well-developed thalline exciple. Epithecium is pigmented, and occasionally has granular inclusions. The hymenium is always colourless. Hypothecium is chondroid, and made-up of thick-walled, conglutinated cells. Paraphyses are netted, with apical cells that are sometimes capitate, and often pigmented to some extent. Asci are 2 or 8-spored. =Spores= The ascospores are simple, colourless, ellipsoid, thick walled, with a broad range of dimensions: 20-120 √ó 10-50 ¬µm. Pycnidia, if present, are produced along the lamina, and minute, immersed, and punctiform with a dark apex. Conidia, if present, are short and bacilliform. =Chemistry= Members of the genus have a diverse chemistry, including fatty acids, depsides, depsidones, and pigments. Ecology Menegazzia species are most often corticolous, but several species are saxicolous, muscicolous, and/or terricolous. This group tends to be most abundant and diverse in the southern beech (Nothofagus) forests of Australasia and South America. Most species appear to be very slow growing, especially in dryer habitats, but more study is needed here. Evolution Ascus evolution in Menegazzia is of particular interest, because many species have 2-spores per ascus, while all nearly other genera in the Parmeliaceae have 8-spores (making the character likely plesiomorphic for the family). Uses Menegazzia does not produce any economically important products, nor is it known to have had any uses by indigenous peoples. However, the genus is important for some small insects, which use the hollow lobes for shelter and the upper cortex for food.

Homer Tutt (1882 ‚Äì 1951), known collectively as the Tutt Brothers, were American vaudeville producers, writers, and performers of the late 19th and early 20th century. They were also known as Whitney & Tutt, Tutt & Whitney and the Whitney Brothers. They were prominent in black vaudeville and created over forty revues for black audiences. Biography Salem Tutt Whitney was born on September 16, 1878 (some sources say he was born in 1876, and still others say 1869) in Logansport, Indiana Floyd J. Calvin. \\"Salem Tutt Whitney Scores Poor Stage Facilities.\\" Pittsburgh Courier, January 1, 1927, p. 13. , as was his brother J. Homer Tutt, who was born there on January 31, 1882. They referred to themselves as brothers, and may have been half-brothers. Whitney originally intended to become a minister but later decided to become a performer, and left college. He attended the National School of Journalism and gained amateur experience in acting, comedy and writing. He married singer Emma Baynard (sister of William A. Baynard); she died at a young age in 1908.Peterson (2001), p. 21 From 1888 through 1905, the brothers performed in their traveling tent show called Silas Green from New Orleans. The show, which ran until the 1940s, was bought by circus owner Eph Williams although the brothers never received payment. They formed the Smart Set Company in the 1910s, possibly taken over from Sherman H. Dudley.In latter years, it was called The Smarter Set Company, possibly to avoid conflict with the publisher of the magazine The Smart Set. From 1910‚Äì1925 Whitney and Tutt produced more than 40 revues for black performers and audiences, writing and performing in the shows themselves. Some of their performers found fame in their own right, including blues singer Mamie Smith who danced in the brothers' Smart Set as a teenager. One of the Brothers' main productions was a musical farce called George Washington Bullion. Starring Whitney as a tobacco plantation owner, it was popular with audiences and ran for two decades. Their musical Oh Joy! played on Broadway for four weeks. It had originally starred Ethel Waters when performed in Boston, but when the only theatre space they could find in New York City was on a tennis court under a tent, Waters pulled out and was replaced by Ethel Williams. Both of the brothers played in Marc Connelly's play The Green Pastures (1930). They also acted in films including Birthright (1924), Marcus Garland (1925), The Broken Violin (1927), and A Daughter of the Congo (1930).

The work of art is said to have the same height, length and weight as the New York City Charging Bull. The bull is reddish as a tribute to the country that commissioned the work. It leans to right instead of the left like Charging Bull and has a more menacing tail. The Bull's popularity has been a problem for local authorities. Description The bull is referred to by many names in the press with one claiming that local dignitaries tend to call it the Bund Financial Bull. Many stories use the moniker the Bund Bull. Some stories refer to it as the Shanghai Bull to differentiate it from the artist's other more famous bull in New York. The Bund Bull at night, 2010 Di Modica credits both Western and Chinese cultures as influence on the work, noting that the \\"Charging Bull\\" and the Chinese zodiac's Ox served as inspiration. The bull is symbolic of perseverance, diligence and wealth in Chinese culture. The animal's confident stance represented a bullish and prosperous future for the rising financial center, Di Modica said. \\"It must be strong. It's about a strong nation,\\" he says. \\"If you observe the tail of the bull, the tail is spirally pointing to the sky, meaning a uplifting financial trend,\\" he said. The bull had been commissioned to be twice the size of Wall Street's Charging Bull. The city also requested a bull that was younger and stronger than New York City's bull to symbolise \\"the energy of Shanghai's economy\\", Zhou Wei, the head of Huangpu district said. \\"That's why the head of the Bund's bull looks up while the Wall Street Bull looks downward,\\" he said. The bronze bull was crafted in Wyoming by a team of 40 that made five identical versions. At tall, long and 2.5 tonnes (2.7 tons), it is the same size as the Wall Street version, but \\"redder, younger and stronger\\" Di Modica said. The work was supposed to have been completed before the Chinese year of the Ox ended in February 2010. The Bull was installed the week before the Expo 2010 Shanghai China, referred to as the Shanghai World Expo, which opened on May 1. Sometimes speaking in Italian, Di Modica attended the unveiling on May 15, 2010 on the Bund waterfront. Location HSBC building in 2016 It is located in the Bund, which is considered to be a location that symbolizes the era of European colonial capitalism in China, and it will be adjacent to the Huangpu River in Shanghai's Pudong district, which is a dynamically growing economic development zone. The bull is located in a square with four stock price screens across the river from the city's financial district. The newly opened square is being called Bund Financial Square. Like its Wall Street counterpart, the Bund Bull's male genitalia is rumored to produce good luck when stroked. Despite a constant security, visitors attempt to climb the bull to pray for good luck and hang bags on the horns while taking pictures. Eventually, the cordoning was discontinued due to the strong public desire to be close to the bull.

It is unique because it is the only race measured in nautical miles as opposed to statute miles. The Navy Ten Nautical Miler is an event officially sanctioned by USA Track & Field, the national governing body for track and field, long-distance running, and race walking in the United States. The event is coordinated in association with the Memphis Runners Track Club. Inspiration The inaugural run of the Navy Ten Nautical Miler road race took place June 6, 2010, at the Naval Support Activity Mid-South. The Navy Ten Nautical Miler was founded in 2010 to give the United States Navy a premiere foot race to replace the disestablished Blue Angels Marathon. The length of ten nautical miles was chosen as the length because it is roughly the distance from the shore to the horizon when viewed at sea level. It was also the distance traveled by the Allied Forces on D-Day, significant because the inaugural run of the Navy Ten Nautical Miler took place on June 6, 2010, the anniversary of D-Day. A nautical mile is approximately the distance of one minute of arc of latitude on the Earth's surface. Sailors throughout history have used this form of measurement as opposed to statute miles or kilometers. Route The race begins at the North 82 Gym, onboard NSA Mid-South, and runs north through the Glen Eagle Golf Course, the Lazy Anchor Stables, and the Navy Lake recreational facility before turning south down Bethuel Road, then west across Navy Road. The route then turns into the south side of the base, and follows the perimeter road around the base housing area, then turns south up Singleton Parkway before exiting back out to Navy Road. The run ends back at the North 82 Gym. In keeping with the theme, mile markers throughout the route are also marked off in nautical miles rather than statute miles. Awards Awards will be presented three deep in the following categories: * Overall - Male & Female * Masters 40+ * Grand Masters 50+ * Senior Masters 60+ * Wheelchair * Each Age Group - 12-13; 14-15; 16-19; 20-24; 25-29; 30-34; 35-39; 40-44; 45-49; 50-54; 55-59; 60-64; 65-69; and 70-over. Afghanistan In April 2010, race coordinators were contacted by Navy personnel serving in Farah, Afghanistan interested in running a satellite version of the race there. As such, the race was ran concurrently in both locations, with winners in each category crowned locally in both locations. The two locations were connected via satellite uplink.

For this qualitative research project, interviewers were trained to ask probing questions and used tape recorders in order to encourage conversation flow with the anonymous interviewees. The final report, published by the Gender Centre, is meant to complement empirical evidence already existing about the rate of HIV/AIDS in West Africa. The Ghanaian government has adopted the popular ABCs of HIV prevention (abstinence, be faithful, use a condom), but the research by the Gender Centre shows that gender norms and domestic violence make this approach to combating the spread of HIV somewhat ineffective.Gender Norms, Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre. Women in Ghana are traditionally sexually submissive, meaning that they are not always able to deny their male partners sex or insist on condom use. Men, on the other hand, are often free to take multiple sexual partners and even multiple wives. The practice of wife inheritance in which a widow will marry her deceased husband's relative can promote the spread of HIV as well, since the woman may have the virus herself or can contract it from her new husband's other wives or partners. Additionally, the social stigmatization faced by women already infected discourages them from revealing their positive status, putting others at risk for contracting the disease. After this initial research, the Gender Centre has been conducting meetings and workshops to raise awareness about how such social norms are putting women at a higher risk for contracting HIV. The Center endeavors to reverse these detrimental gender norms by holding support meetings in major cities all over the country and by running a series of radio shows about women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS conducted in the local languages of Twi, Ewe, and Wale, as well as English. Collaborations The Gender Centre has collaborated with other organizations and agencies as it works to promote awareness about the issues facing women in Ghana today.

The onset of lente insulin is one to two hours after the dose is administered, and the peak effect is approximately 8 to 12 hours after administration, with some effects lasting over 24 hours. Lente insulin products, along with other insulin analogs in the same family, were discontinued by their manufacturers in the mid 2000s, and are no longer permitted to be marketed for use in humans in the US.Federal Register Doc. E9-2901Federal Register Doc. 2011-14164 This was in part because health care providers began to favor more predictable forms of insulin, such as recombinant NPH insulin. History Lente insulin arose from research into ways to alter the pharmacokinetics of bovine or porcine insulin products. Prior to the late 1940s, insulin products were derived from pork or beef sources, and then used virtually unaltered as \\"short-acting\\" insulin products. It was known by 1950 that the addition of protamine or zinc could alter the duration of action of these insulin products, and in 1952, K. Hallas-M√∏ller at Novo Nordisk produced the first commercial insulin zinc suspension for use in humans. For decades, lente insulin was used as a basal insulin, designed to mimic the body's continual slow release of insulin throughout the day. Compared to NPH insulin, lente insulin has a similar but more protracted loss of action after a dose is administered. In the 1990s, recombinant DNA technology allowed for the mass production of the human insulin protein in yeast or bacteria. This led to formulations of recombinant lente human insulin products by the early 2000s. However, lente insulin began to fall out of favor with doctors in the mid-2000s, when insulin analogues such as glargine began to be approved. Insulin analogues made by recombinant DNA production methods have less variation in their strength and purity between doses and batches. Furthermore, while lente insulin (and NPH) have a definitive peak in effect, insulin analogs have a much less pronounced peak, making for more predictable effects and less risk of hypoglycemia. Veterinary use After the discontinuation of lente insulin for human use, the FDA approved a veterinary porcine-derived lente insulin (vetsulin¬Æ, Merck Animal Health) for daily use in dogs or twice daily use in cats. Insulin analogs used in humans after the discontinuation of lente insulin have not yet been proven to provide the same benefits and predictability as lente insulin in cats and dogs. For this and other reasons, lente insulin is still commonly used in both dogs and cats. Adverse effects = Hypoglycemia = The primary adverse effect of any insulin product is hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia can manifest as dizziness, disorientation, trouble speaking, and changes in mental status. In severe cases, hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness if not treated. As lente insulin continues to be absorbed in the body for hours after use, these signs and symptoms may be delayed from the time of administration and begin with little or no warning. = Hypersensitivity = Lente insulin is a combination of porcine and bovine insulin products which are filtered and combined with zinc to form the suspension. Even product that is filtered very well is still of animal origin, and there is a chance the body may recognize the foreign protein as such and form antibodies against it. These reactions are slightly more likely with lente insulin than with insulin derived from a single source as lente insulin contains bovine insulin which is more immunogenic than porcine insulin. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Insulin is a protein normally produced in the pancreas which regulates metabolic processes throughout the body. The primary role of insulin is to increase the metabolism of glucose, storage of energy in adipose tissue, and decrease the body's own production of glucose. =Pharmacokinetics= The half life of endogenous insulin once it enters the bloodstream is 4 to 6 minutes. This allows the endocrine system to rapidly adapt to changing conditions within the body. Exogenous insulin, however, would not be effective with a short half life, as it would require continuous injection or infusion to have the desired effect. While it is difficult to change the rate at which the protein is metabolized in the bloodstream, it is possible to alter how fast the protein is absorbed from the site of injection in various ways. Lente insulin was formulated by the addition of zinc to the crude porcine and bovine insulin extracts, which causes the insulin protein to form larger crystals which dissolve into the body slower upon injection. This means that while the insulin in the bloodstream is still metabolized in 4‚Äì6 minutes, more insulin is continually being absorbed from the dose injected for hours after administration. Compared to NPH insulin, another intermediate acting insulin, up to 40% of the dose of lente insulin may remain unabsorbed for over 24 hours after administration. The variation in absorption between doses in the same patient of lente insulin is comparable to that of insulin NPH. The distribution of insulin is not well understood, but it is known that it is heavily bound to receptors throughout the body (approximately 80% to receptors on liver cells) and metabolized in large part by phase one processes in the liver. Of the approximately 71-minute estimated lifetime of an insulin molecule, over 60 minutes is spent attached to a liver receptor. In addition, circulating unbound insulin is excreted and reabsorbed by the kidneys and broken down in the lysosomes. The remainder of metabolism of insulin molecules is via intracellular proteolysis via insulysin and related enzymes.  Manufacturing  Commercial preparations of lente insulin are standardized to 30% semilente (amorphous precipitates of insulin), and 70% ultralente (crystallized insulin). In early versions, the semilente insulin was extracted from pigs, and the ultralente insulin was extracted from cows. Society and culture Brand names of lente insulin that have been discontinued include Iletin (animal), and HumulinL/NovolinL (human). Lente insulin is currently produced under the brand name vetsulin for veterinary use in dogs and cats with diabetes.

He published numerous collections of poetry, well received by readers and critics alike. He also translated a number of Russian works into Slovene. Biography =Early life= Tone Pavƒçek was born on 29 September 1928 at ≈†entjurij in southeastern Slovenia. He attended the first grade of elementary school in Mirna Peƒç, but was soon sent to a boarding school in Ljubljana. There he graduated from a classical high school, and went on to study law, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1954, although he never performed legal services. =Professional career= In 1955 Pavƒçek started working as journalist for the daily newspapers ' (Ljubljana Daily) and ' (People‚Äôs Justice). In 1958 he worked as a journalist and later a programme director at RTV Slovenia, a position he held until 1972. In the late 1960s he was involved in the Slovenization of the national television, taking part in productions of well-received children's series such as ' and ', the notable series for the general public ' and ', and a memorable television film '. From 1972 to his retirement in 1990, he was editor-in-chief of the press, a major publisher at the time in Slovenia. For a period of four years, starting in 1963, he was also an art director for the Slovenian Youth Theatre in Ljubljana. He presided over the Slovenian Writers Association from 1979 to 1983. =Political engagement= From 1986 to 1990, Pavƒçek was a member of the National Assembly. He was also a member of a working group of the Slovenian Writers Association and Slovenian Sociological Association that created the basis for the first Slovenian constitution, today referred to as ‚ÄùThe Writers' Constitution.‚Äù It was published in 1988 in the Journal for Critique of Science, for Imagination and New Anthropology. Pavƒçek took part in a public rally on Congress Square on 8 May 1989, where he read the May Declaration, the first public document demanding Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia. =Late life= In 1990 Pavƒçek retired and retreated from public life. He remained a frequent guest at literary and cultural events, visiting libraries, schools, and other public institutions. In 1996 he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and in 2001 a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was awarded the Golden Order for Merits of the Republic of Slovenia in 2009. Tone Pavƒçek died on 21 October 2011, at the age of 83 in Ljubljana. He was buried with military honors in ≈Ωale cemetery. Writing Throughout his life, he was devoted to literature as poet, author of children's books and translator. From his first published poems in ' (Poems of the Four, 1953) to his final pages of ' (Angels, 2012) his poetry is entwined with vitalism and positive attitudes towards life. His poetry for children gained a wide audience due to its original fairy-tale motifs, integrating fantasy and folk elements. Especially important are his translations of Russian literature. As a highly prolific writer, Pavƒçek's work was recognized by a number of institutions. For the contribution to children's literature he was a three-time recipient of the Levstik Award (1958, 1961, 2005), and two-time nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Award (2010, 2012). He received the Pre≈°eren Fund Award (1965) and Grand Pre≈°eren Award (1986) for his collections of poems ' (Trapped Ocean) and ' (Heritage). For the book ' he received the Veronika Award (2007). His translations were recognized with the Sovre Award in 1979. =For adults= Pavƒçek published his first poem, \\"\\" (A Sonnet to Ivan Cankar) at the age of 18 in the contemporary youth literary magazine '. His first collection of poems, ' (Poems of the Four), co-authored by Kajetan Koviƒç, Ciril Zlobec, and Janez Menart, was published in 1953. It marks a significant shift to intimism in the Slovene poetry tradition of the 20th century. In his next collections, ' (Trapped Ocean, 1964) and ' (Pagan Hymns, 1976), his lyrical expression remains vitalistic, idolizing nature and the countryside. His poetic development reached its peak in his two collections of poems entitled ' (Heritage, 1983) and ' (Wasteland, 1988). Touched by tragic death of his son, he discusses the questions of life and death, identifying an individual as well as community in the process. His works entitled ' (Slow Downs, 1998), ' (Gifts, 2005), and ' (2006) mark a return to his native Lower Carniola, where he was born, and Slovene Istria, where he resided. The collection of poems ' (Angels, 2012), which he finished on his deathbed and was published posthumously, received a great public and critical acclaim, making it the best selling book in Slovenia in 2012. =For children= In his numerous fairy tales, picture books, and verses, Pavƒçek's children's poetry is extremely popular with younger readers. Through words and rhythm, sparkling with wit and optimism, he is able to communicate to his readers on a personal level, inviting them to relive their own experiences. One of his best-known children's books is ' (Jurij Muri in Africa: About Boy Who Didn't Like to Wash, 1958), which had three sequels: the last one entitled ' (Juri Muri around Slovenia) in 2011. =Translations= Pavƒçek is notable for translations of his contemporaries, especially the Russian poets Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Anna Akhmatova, Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetaeva, and Nikolay Zabolotsky.

Life Sidney James Hunt was born in 1896 and studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. During the 1920s he designed bookplates and contributed modern- style drawings for several international art magazines, such as Artwork, Der Querschnitt, Der Sturm, Tambour and Contimporanul. Hunt also published experimental poems in modern journals, such as Transition, Seed, and Blues: A Magazine of New Rhythms. In October 1925, he held his first solo exhibition at the Mayor Gallery in London. Between 1926 and 1932, he was a member of the Seven and Five Society, one of the most progressive art societies in interwar England. In 1926 and 1927, Hunt edited the avant-garde magazine Ray, which has been described as the English equivalent of influential art journals from the 1920s such as Merz, Mecano and De Stijl.Iria Candela, \\"'The only English periodical of the avant-garde': Sidney Hunt and the journal 'Ray'\\", The Burlington Magazine (April 2010), pp. 239-244. Ray featured work of leading figures of the European avant-garde such as Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky, Theo van Doesburg, Naum Gabo and Hans Arp. It has been said that Hunt died in his studio in 1940, aged forty-four, during The Blitz.Exh. cat. The Artist as Illustrator 1880-1940, London (Michael Parkin Fine Art Ltd), 1984, s.p. Style Much of Hunt's work is homoerotic; he had homosexual patrons like Sir Edward Marsh; Alfred Flechtheim reproduced his Ganymede in Der Querschnitt (1921, VIII, p. 346); his drawings of boys appeared with those of Ralph Chubb in The Island in 1931; the bookplates he produced feature naked youths; and Oswell Blakeston published his experimental prose poem fantasies of 18-year- old hermaphrodites in the first, 1933 issue of Seed (p. 7). His themes included boys bathing, sunbathing, posing with pansies and possibly boy prostitutes on a \\"Saturday afternoon\\" in Artwork (1924, I, p. 75). He is one of the few modernist artists to use abstraction to express the essentials of male beauty in simplified forms like his painting of \\"Ganymede\\" or by contrasts of black and white as in \\"Drawing\\" (1922). As Candela has speculated, he may also be the creator of the photomontages that he published in Ray (pp. 2, 15 and 27), as by the otherwise unknown P. Capeli. His work as a pioneer of British modernism and as an abstract gay artist deserves much more reassessment.

Leppert attended Christian Brothers High School in Memphis and signed his first pro contract with the New York Yankees. He played in the Yankee farm system for five seasons. After 1954, a season during which Leppert batted .313 with ten home runs and 170 hits for the Double-A Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association, Leppert was shipped to the Baltimore Orioles in a 17-player trade, one of the largest deals in Major League Baseball history.SABR (The swap featured Bob Turley, Don Larsen and Gus Triandos, who would go on to stardom in the Majors.) He then appeared in 40 games for the 1955 Orioles, mustering only eight hits in 70 at bats for a .114 career MLB batting average. He had one extra-base hit, a triple, during that time. Leppert finished his playing career in minor league baseball with Birmingham in 1956. He hit .291 in 789 minor-league games. He is sometimes confused with Donald George Leppert, a catcher who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators during the 1960s, and later a longtime coach for several MLB teams.

The band consists of lead vocalist Stephen Broadley, guitarists Michael King and Alex Wiezak, bassist Luke Neale and drummer Paul Wechter. The band's sound is an energetic mixture of punk, dance and new wave, which is characterized by an emphasis on percussion with polyrhythmic qualities and a quirky sometimes described as 'violent' but simplistic duel between guitars with a danceable edge. In 2009, the band released their mini-album Cardio- Vascular which has been received with widespread acclaim from many notable publications. History The band formed in 2003 as a hardcore punk band named 'The Tragic Vision' which consisted of Stephen Broadley, Michael King, Alex Wiezak, Jordan Daniel and Adam Mallabone. The band soon played many basement shows and house parties until less than a year later Jordan and Adam left the band. Soon after they recruited bassist Luke Neale and Drummer Jon McGovern. Developing their hardcore punk sound with many danceable qualities and soon becoming a fully fledged band they began gigging under name 'Mirror!Mirror!' in 2004. After a few months of relentless touring with bands such as Klaxons and Blood Red Shoes they released a split 7-inch record with Rolo Tomassi on Speedowax records.\\"The fairest of them all?\\", BBC, 27 January 2006, retrieved 2011-05-11 The band then went on a break which lasted a year and during this time Jon McGovern had left the band which led to the recruitment of Craig Thornicroft to play drums. During this time they abandoned their hardcore punk sound and replaced it with a more dance-oriented sound which holds the intensity of hardcore punk which they possessed in previous projects. The band released the single \\"Wolfgang Bang\\", which remains in their setlist. Soon they signed a deal with Holy Roar Records to release a seven track mini-album but decided to not work under the name 'Mirror!Mirror!' and changed their name to 'Youves'. While writing new material and touring non-stop through the UK and Europe they released their mini-album Cardio- Vascular in the spring of 2009 to positive reviews from the NMEPatashnik, Ben (2009) \\"Album Review: Youves Cardio-Vascular\\", NME, 8 May 2009, retrieved 2011-05-11 and Rock Sound and the single and music video \\"Aladdins Rave\\" was released with moderate rotation which also led to the band enjoying a considerable amount of press.

History The society was one of many that were established in Georgian Dublin to relieve the poverty that pervaded the city at that time. There was no system of public welfare, nor, until much later, any general policy on the part of the government to alleviate the problem of poverty. It was left to parishes (which in the poorer areas of the city had very little to spare), private individuals and institutions to ease poverty through voluntary work. With this object in mind a group of men met in Mountrath St. on 15 March 1790 to form a society \\"to be called the Charitable Society for the Relief of Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers of all Religious Persuasions in the City of Dublin.\\"Lindsay, p. 3 The founders of the society were, as described in the History of Dublin (1815), \\"a few individuals in the middle ranks of life, inhabiting a part of the town where the population was poor and crowded, had daily opportunities of knowing that many poor creatures who were unable to dig and ashamed to beg, expired of want and were often found dead in the sequestred garrets and cellars to which they had silently returned\\".History of the City of Dublin The part of town referred to was north of the river Liffey, in the parish of St. Michan's. The Society has traditionally acknowledged the following to have been the founders: Samuel Rosborough (linen draper), Christopher Connolly (grocer), Patrick Magin (grocer), Philip Shea (carpenter), Michael Stedman (stone-cutter), Peter Fleming (fruitman), Timothy Knowlan (pawnbroker), Thomas Wilmot, William Blacker, Laurence Toole (schoolmaster) and James Reilly. Members paid a subscription of at least 2 pence per week, which entitled them to recommend deserving persons to be given relief by the Society. Samuel Rosborough was for many years treasurer of the Society. He died on 3 November 1832 and was buried in St. Michan's church. On the 30th anniversary of his death a tablet was erected in the church to commemorate his good deeds.Journal of the Association for the Preservation of the Memorials of the Dead in Ireland, 1894, p. 244 References ;Notes ;Sources * *History of the City of Dublin by Whitelaw, Warburton, and Walsh. 2 vols.

History Jo√£o Maria Tudela was born in Louren√ßo Marques, the capital of the Portuguese African territory of Mozambique in 1929. His father's family was wealthy with noble ancestors; Tudela's grandmother gave to his father a part of her patrimony when he married Tudela'a mother. While in Mozambique with his young parents, his father fled the territory for the United Kingdom on a cruise ship, after he fell in love with a British woman (Tudela would only see his father again as a 16-year-old student in Coimbra; his mother would marry another man that Tudela would always call his \\"father\\"). Tudela described his biological father as a \\"prince\\" who a premature marriage at 18 years had turned into an emotionally unstable person. He spent his early youth studying in South Africa and in his home-town of Louren√ßo Marques where he started to play as a soloist at the Liceu Salazar (Salazar High School). He played piano, guitar, and viola without even knowing music. He went to Coimbra, first as a secondary school (high school) student and then as a student of the Coimbra University Law School. In Coimbra he joined the academic music groups and, though his studies did not progress and he did not graduate, his artistic talent was developed. Due to his scarce interest and lack of results at the university, his family imposed his return to Mozambique after four years with little academic progress. Tudela worked first for the insurance company Companhia de Seguros Imp√©rio and then in Shell, where he remained for a decade as a sales manager. By this time he developed his talent as a tennis player, becoming one of the best athletes of Mozambique in that sport. But Jo√£o Maria Tudela's passion for music was huge and he never stopped singing, especially the Coimbra fado, and his fame became large in the whole of Mozambique. He also became interested in African music and rhythm. In subsequent years he continued to write and act in Mozambique, starting a partnership with the orchestra of Dan Hill. In 1959 Jo√£o Maria Tudela created his first and most successful song ever, Kanimambo, which made a big career in mainland Portugal, the United States and in South America. Always defending his status as amateur, he was invited to a tour in Brazil. In the return of this tour he performed through Portugal with great success, and a few months later he returned to stay definitely as a professional. In the early sixties, Jo√£o Maria Tudela entered the Portuguese art scene by the big door. His elegant style had earned him a legion of fans, and a career crowned with numerous awards, including the Critics Prize for Best TV in 1962. In 1968 he sang Ao Vento e √†s Andorinhas in the Festival RTP da Can√ß√£o. During the same year, after being barred from returning to RTP following the interpretation of Cama 4, Sala 5, written by Jos√© Carlos Ary dos Santos and Nuno Nazareth Fernandes, Tudela resolves to end his career. The last years of his artistic career are marked by an increasing demand on the themes (lyrics and compositions), and a more critical approach to the policies of the Estado Novo regime. Jo√£o Maria Tudela, Cotonete with Herman Jos√© with Herman Jos√© After the Carnation revolution (1974), Tudela only acted as an entertainer in a few RTP TV shows and theatre and casino performances.

His career included four and a half seasons, from 1978 to 1982, as the head football coach at Eastern Michigan University, where he coached the Eastern Michigan Hurons through most of a school-record 27-game losing streak. College athlete Stock played fullback at Northwestern University under coach Ara Parseghian. From 1959 to 1960 he led the Northwestern Wildcats in rushing. Stock won Kodak and UPI All American honors in 1960, as well as All-Big Ten Conference honors in 1959 and 1960. He was co- captain of Northwestern's 1959 and 1960 football teams. Stock also played catcher for Northwestern's baseball team and earned All-Big Ten honors in 1959. College assistant Following his graduation, Stock served as freshman coach at Northwestern in 1961 before serving in the United States Army. After leaving the army, he worked for one year as an assistant coach at South High School in Akron, Ohio. In 1966 and 1967 he coached the freshman team at the University at Buffalo, before working as wide receivers and running backs coach at the United States Naval Academy the following year. From 1969 through 1974, Stock rejoined Ara Parseghian at Notre Dame, first as freshman coach and subsequently as wide receivers coach. During his time there the team won the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas, and went undefeated to win a national championship in 1973, and the team posted a record of 55‚Äì10‚Äì1. From 1975 through 1977 he coached under John Jardine at Wisconsin, first as running backs coach, and then as offensive coordinator. Eastern Michigan Stock's tenure as head coach of the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team is primarily remembered for his role in a school-record 27-game losing streak from 1980 through 1982, including a winless season in 1981. He was fired after the team lost the first three games of 1982, including a 49‚Äì12 pasting at Louisiana Tech and 35‚Äì0 shutout at Miami, bringing the losing streak to 22 games; the team went on to lose five more consecutive games under interim coach Bob LaPointe before the streak was broken with a 9‚Äì7 win over Kent State on November 6, 1982. Stock's teams were held scoreless seven times, only won three Mid-American Conference games, were outscored by a total of 809 points ‚Äî nearly 18 points per game, and his final record of 6‚Äì38‚Äì1 gives him a .144 winning percentage, easily the lowest of any coach to remain at Eastern more than one season. Assistant coach After leaving Eastern Michigan, Stock returned to working as an assistant coach. In 1983, he coached offensive backfield for the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL), mentoring running back Herschel Walker.

It was originally set up as a \\"hospital for incurables\\" to provide sufferers with food, shelter and relief from their distressing conditions. History The Royal Hospital in 1907 In Georgian Dublin there were a number of charitable music societies that raised money to alleviate the suffering of the poor and ill. There was no system of public welfare, nor, until much later, any general policy on the part of the government to alleviate the problem of poverty, which pervaded the city at that time. One of these societies was the Dublin Charitable Musical Society of Crow Street, the leading light of which was Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, a politician (MP for Trim 1729-1746) and amateur violinist who took part in charity concerts. The society decided in 1743 to donate their funds to set up and support a hospital for incurables. A house for this purpose was rented in Fleet Street, fitted up, and opened, with a nurse, a staff of doctors and surgeons, and 23 patients as the \\"Hospital for Incurables, Dublin\\" on 23 May 1744.John Watson: The Gentleman and Citizen's Almanack for 1745, quoted in Burke, p. 3 In the early years of the hospital the doctors included Francis Le Hunte (from County Wexford, a founder-member of the Royal Dublin Society). The hospital moved to Townsend Street in 1753. In 1793 the hospital exchanged location with the Lock Hospital, which suited both hospitals, and moved to Donnybrook, a suburb of the city. It received a Royal Charter and became the \\"Royal Hospital for Incurables, Dublin\\" in 1887. In the 1980s it started to specialise in rehabilitation for the elderly and services for young disabled adults and, at that time, was renamed the \\"Royal Hospital, Donnybrook\\".

It is Clancy's first novel in seven years after The Teeth of the Tiger (2003), and follows the hunt by The Campus for \\"the Emir\\", a Middle Eastern terrorist based on Osama bin Laden. It unites several characters from the Ryanverse, including former president Jack Ryan, his son Jack Ryan Jr., his nephews Dominic and Brian Caruso, and Rainbow Six veterans John Clark and Domingo Chavez. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary Most wanted terrorist Saif Rahman Yasin, known as the Emir, secretly enters the United States by private plane. Having altered his physical appearance and living in the state of Nevada, he coordinates his massive operation as leader of terrorist organization Umayyad Revolutionary Council (URC), codenamed Lotus. It aims to weaken the current presidential administration with a series of seemingly isolated terrorist attacks and culminating in the destruction of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, using a nuclear device assembled from radioactive material stolen from an abandoned nuclear waste storage site in Russia, in order to poison the water table for the western United States. After successfully foiling a hostage situation in the Swedish embassy in Tripoli, John Clark and Domingo Chavez are forcibly retired from their duties in the CIA and Rainbow. They are then recruited into The Campus, where they take part in the organization's hunt for the Emir, which spans through Sweden, Pakistan, Canada, and Libya. They suffer a tragedy when operative Brian Caruso died due to injuries sustained during a firefight with his brother Dominic against URC terrorists in Tripoli. After further investigation and at one point cooperating with National Counterterrorism Center deputy head and Clark's longtime friend Mary Pat Foley, The Campus later deduce that the Emir is in the U.S. Meanwhile, former president Jack Ryan is working on his memoirs and initially refusing to speak out against his successor, Ed Kealty. When he finds out that the Kealty administration are planning to prosecute U.S. Army Ranger Sam Driscoll for murdering sleeping Middle Eastern terrorists in a cave during their fruitless search for the Emir, he decides to announce his candidacy for President of the United States in the next election. After the announcement, charges against Driscoll are dropped and he was given an honorable discharge. Clark later recruits him into The Campus. Additionally, Ryan finds out that his son Jack Ryan, Jr. is working for The Campus as an analyst, which he reluctantly accepts. URC terrorists destroy a Petrobras oil refinery outside S√£o Paulo, Brazil and trigger a series of attacks on small towns across the United States. Jack and Clark later thwart the destruction of a cargo ship carrying flammable material, killing the Indonesian perpetrators tasked by the URC. Chavez and Dominic are sent to Brazil in order to investigate the refinery incident and later capture a URC courier, who reveals that the Emir is in the U.S. and coordinating the attacks. Along with Clark and Jack, they proceed to Las Vegas to apprehend him, preventing him from blowing up the Yucca nuclear waste storage facility in the process. After returning to Virginia, they interrogate him by injecting him with succinylcholine and simulating a heart attack, allowing him to confess his crimes and reveal the plans behind Lotus, which involves the cooperation of Pakistani intelligence in conquering the country and securing their nuclear inventory (to be continued in the next novel Locked On). After a day of interrogations, the Emir was covertly given by The Campus to the FBI in order to be imprisoned and charged by due process of law.

Dead or Alive was announced by publisher Penguin Group in a press release on April 7, 2010. Penguin USA president David Shanks stated: \\"Tom‚Äôs genius for telling a story with exceptional realism and cutting edge authenticity are his hallmarks as a writer. In his latest novel, he turns up the tension between U.S. forces and their most lethal rivals.‚Äù Several characters from the Ryanverse such as Jack Ryan, John Clark, and The Campus were brought together in what was dubbed \\"the All-Star Team\\". A book trailer was released on November 4, 2010. Clancy promoted the novel in a video discussion with retired U.S. Air Force general Chuck Horner, which was released on December 3, 2010. Dead or Alive was launched by the Yeomen Warders and the Red Devil paratroopers at the Tower of London on the eve of its eventual release. Osama bin Laden The book was notable for its antagonist the Emir and his terrorist organization Umayyad Revolutionary Council, which were based on real-life terrorist Osama bin Laden and his group al Qaeda. It also inspired the idea that special forces units hunting for a terrorist like bin Laden are more likely to find him living in comfort, rather than in a cave in Pakistan or Afghanistan. This was proven true when bin Laden was captured and killed by the U.S. Navy SEALs in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2011, five months after the novel was published.  Reception  =Commercial= The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. In addition, it debuted at number three on the USA Today's Best-selling Books list. Two years later, the mass-market paperback edition of the book peaked at number four on the New York Times bestseller list. =Critical= The book received average reviews. Publishers Weekly lauded it, saying that \\"Clancy is back at the top of his game.\\" The Los Angeles Times was slightly less generous, calling it \\"sprawling but propulsive.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave it a mixed review, stating: \\"If reality were a comic book or a Stallone script, this would be a useful road map. As it is, it‚Äôll be gobbled up like a Happy Meal, Ronald Reagan‚Äôs 'perfect yarn' franchised into neatly packaged commodity.\\"  References  Category:2010 American novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Techno-thriller novels Category:Novels by Tom Clancy Category:American political novels Category:Political thriller novels Category:Ryanverse Category:G.

The miniseries was commissioned by the National Film Board of Canada and consists of 8 one-hour episodes. Episodes #\\"The Road to Total War\\" #\\"Anybody's Son Will Do\\" #\\"The Profession of Arms\\" #\\"The Deadly Game of Nations\\" #\\"Keeping the Old Game Alive\\" #\\"Notes on Nuclear War\\" #\\"Goodbye War\\" #\\"The Knife Edge of Deterrence\\" Background In the early 1980s, the National Film Board of Canada commissioned journalist Gwynne Dyer to create the miniseries War, echoing concerns expressed by the decade's peace movement about the threat of nuclear war. Dyer had previous military experience, and he filmed the miniseries in ten countries and featured six national armies. He approached the Pentagon for permission to film the United States military, which it granted except for conducting interviews with prominent policymakers. Dyer was able to film Marines in boot camp, the United States Sixth Fleet, and U.S. Air Force bases in Germany. The New York Times wrote, \\"The Pentagon's hesitancy was understandable, considering that the subtitle of War is: A Commentary by Gwynne Dyer. Mr. Dyer holds strong antiwar opinions, happens to know a great deal about the military, and speaks up on camera and in writing.\\" Part Two, \\"Anybody's Son Will Do\\", examines the concept of military indoctrination in terms of how enforced group conformity, personality destruction and dehumanization is used on male young adult recruits in order to get them to kill on command without question or hesitation, which does not come naturally to most human beings. While the example of the US Marine Corps boot camp training is examined in the documentary, it is made clear that the same techniques are used in armies and non-state military groups, since the basic psychology of male young adults is largely the same throughout the world. Dr. Dyer interviews both recruits and Marine Corps trainers to provide a wide-ranging insight into the psychology of training people for war, as he states, \\"away from the battlefield.\\" The miniseries examined warfare, how it had evolved, and what its consequences were. It also examined the challenge of armies' roles in face of total war. Military leaders involved with NATO and the Warsaw Pact were featured in interviews, many of them speaking to Western media for the first time. Officers from different countries talked about how nuclear technology affected their profession and how a conflict between superpowers would likely lead to all-out nuclear war. Dyer argued that this war could only be avoided by eliminating nuclear arsenals. The miniseries received \\"great acclaim\\" globally but was controversial in Canada. One of the episodes, \\"The Profession of Arms\\", was nominated for an Academy Award. The series was broadcast to 45 countries. Bibliography *Dyer, Gwynne (2006). War: The Lethal Custom.

It is also known as Varkala Temple. Janardana Swami is a form of Lord Vishnu. It is a very well known temple in Kerala about 10.9 km west of Kallambalam on NH 66 near sea, 25 km north of Thiruvananthapuram city, 8 km south of famous backwater destination Kappil and 2 km from Varkala Railway Station,14 km north west of Attingal municipality. It is situated near the Arabian sea shore.It is referred to as Dakshin Kashi (Benares of the south). The temple is located close to the Varkala Beach, which is considered to have medicinal properties since the waters wash the nearby medicinal plants. It is also an important Ayurveda treatment center. The temple has an ancient bell removed from a shipwreck, donated by the captain of the Dutch vessel which sank near Varkala without causing any casualties. Varkala, a sea side emerging city of Trivandrum, also known as Janardanapuram or Udayamarthandapuram or Balit is a sacred pilgrim center situated in Trivandrum and is famous for its ancient temple of Vishnu, who is popularly called as Janardana. In Sri Maha Bhavatham, mention is made that Balarama, the elder brother of Sri Krishna, visited this shrine during this pilgrimage to the Kanyakumari temple and a few other temples in the south. It is also known as ‚ÄòGaya of the South'. Varkala has many attractions peculiar to the place and draws hundreds of pilgrims and visitors all the year round. Sage Narada, after paying his respects to Lord Narayana, left Vaikuntam to see Brahma. Enraptured by the sweet music of Narada, Narayana followed him unobserved. When Narada reached Brahmaloka, Brahma saw Narayana following his son Narada and offered salutations to him, at which Vishnu, realizing the awkward situation, suddenly disappeared. Brahma found that the person whom he had revered was his own son, Narada. The 'Prajapathis' who were laughing at this incident were cursed by Brahma that they would be born on earth and suffer the miseries of human beings. Narada advised them to perform penance at the place he himself would select for them. Narada threw his ‚ÄòValkalam' (bark upper garment) into the air and at the place where it fell down, they consecrated a temple for Janardanaswamy (a name of Vishnu). Hence the name Varkala is a corruption of ‚ÄòValkala', but the name came into prominent usage. The temple of Sri Janardana is situated on the summit of a table-land adjoining the sea. It is located on one of the hill-tops, which is reached by a long and wearisome flight of steps and one feels tired on arriving at the feet of the Lord. At the entrance to the inner shrine are the idols of Hanuman and Garuda on either side and in the main shrine is the idol of Sri. Janardana with Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi. The temple of Janardana is a fine example of Kerala art and architecture. The circular ‚ÄòSanctum sanctorum\\" surmounted by a conical dome of copper sheets, the square ‚Äòmandapa' with beautiful wooden carvings of Navagrahas on the ceiling and copper-plated roof over it, the quadrangular enclosures (prakara) around them, a hall containing a ‚Äòbali peetha' in front of the inner temple are the characteristic features of Kerala style of architecture. The construction period of this temple saw the rise of highly embellished temple. one of the inscriptions indicates that the temple was improved during the reign of Umayamma Rani, who ruled this region during 1677-84 A.D. The main idol has a striking appearance with four arms having all the attributes of Vishnu. In the south-western corner and on the north-eastern side of the outer enclosure are the shrines of Sasta and Shiva with Nandi. To the scientist, Varkala is well known from its geological formation and has been inspected and examined carefully by hordes or geologists and volumes of interesting literature are carefully preserved in the archives of the Government of India . Besides the enchanging sea-view, there is the backwater journey by canal hewn out of the tremendous heights of hills on either side of it. The vegetation on either side of the canal, rising in height is a magnificent sight, has given rise to a series of springs form which gushes out sparkling water throughout the year. The water in supported to have medicinal properties which cure certain ailments. Even a single bath is a tonic which no traveller or visitor should miss History In times of yore, Lord Brahma came to the earth to perform a Yaga (fire Sacrifice). He did it in the present Varkala. He was so much immersed in doing Yaga that he forgot his job of creation. Lord Vishnu came to Varkala to remind Lord Brahma about it in the form of a very old man. The Brahmins assisting Lord Brahma, received the old man and gave him food. But whatever he ate, his hunger was not satiated. Lord Brahma‚Äôs assistants went and told him about it. Then Lord Brahma could understand that the guest was Lord Vishnu himself. He immediately came near Lord Vishnu and found him trying to eat Aabhojanam. Lord Brahma then prevented Lord Vishnu from eating it and told him - \\"Lord, if you eat it, then the final deluge will swallow this world.\\" Lord Vishnu then requested Lord Brahma to stop the Yaga and recommence his job of creation. He also showed him his 'Viswaroopa'. After this one day Sage Narada followed by Lord Vishnu was walking in the sky over Varkala. Lord Brahma who came there saluted Lord Vishnu. The nine Prajapathis to whom only sage Narada was visible laughed at Lord Brahma. Because they thought that Lord Brahma was saluting his own son Sage Narada. Then Lord Brahma corrected them. They felt sad at having committed a sinful deed. Lord Brahma told them that the proper place to pray for their redemption would be shown to them by sage Narada. Sage Narada threw the Valkala (deer‚Äôs skin) that he was wearing towards the earth. It fell in the present Varkala. The Prajapathis wanted a pond to do the atonement. Sage Narada requested lord Vishnu, who made a pond there, using his Chakra (wheel). The Prajapathis did thapas there and were pardoned for their sins. It is believed that the 'Devas' constructed a temple of Lord Vishnu there and were worshiping the Lord Janardhana. But this temple got dilapidated. At that time, several centuries ago, the then Pandya king was affected by a ghost. He went on a pilgrimage but nowhere did he find any cure. When he came to the present day Varkala, he saw the remnants of the dilapidated temple by the side the sea. He prayed to the Lord saying that he would rebuild the temple there. The next day he had a dream. It told him that the following day he should go to the sea and stand near the dilapidated temple. Nearby he would see a huge amount of flowers floating in the sea and that if he searches there he would get an idol. He was instructed to make a golden hand and attach it to the idol and build a temple round it. The present Janardhana idol was recovered from the sea by him. He built the temple and laid down the rules for maintenance of the temple. The idol of Janardhana has Aabhojana in its right hand. People believe that over years this hand is raising slowly. The day that the idol is able to eat the aabhojana from his right hand, the world will face the great deluge. There are small temples of Lord Shiva, Ganapathi, Sastha and Naga Devatha in this temple. The idol is always dressed in sandal and flowers either in the form of Janardhana, Narasimha, Venugopala or Mohini. Ashtami Rohini, the birthday of Lord Krishna, which comes in the month of Chingam (August‚ÄìSeptember) is celebrated as a festival here. On the southern side of the temple two bells are tied. There is a story about it as well. One Dutch ship was passing this way and suddenly the ship refused to move in spite of all efforts. The people told the captain of the ship to tie a bell in the Janardhana temple. It seems the captain and his assistant came ashore and tied the bells. As soon as they tied the bells, the ship started moving. The names inscribed in the bell are 'Peter von Belson' and 'Michelle Evarald'. People believe that if worship of ancestors is done in this temple, then they would be pleased. Possibly because of this the Janardhana is also called Pithru Mokshakan. Festival Every year, in the month of Meenam (March‚ÄìApril), a ten-day Arattu festival is celebrated at the Janardhana Swamy Temple in Kerala's beach town of Varkala. The festival starts with a Kodiyettam flag hoisting ceremony, and ends with a procession of five decorated elephants through the streets. During the fourth and fifth days of the festival, the celebrations include all night long performances such as traditional Kathakali dancing. The arattu (holy bath) of the Lord is conducted on Uthram day in the Arabian sea on the back of the temple. Along with this festival, the days of the appearance of Lord Vishnu's avatars (e.g.: Rama Navami, Ashtami Rohini, Narasimha Jayanthi), Karkadaka Vavu (Amavasya day in the month of Karkadakam, which comes in July or August), and Vaikuntha Ekadashi are also celebrated in the temple. The days of Thiruvonam star, Ekadashi and Thursdays are also considered important, since according to popular custom, these days are dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Deity The presiding deity of this temple is Sri Janarthana Swami. The deity is found in standing position facing towards the east. His right hand is position as if he is performing \\"Aachamanam\\". His right hand is raised towards his mouth and legends say that if his hand goes nearer to his mouth, the world will come to an end. It is believed to happen at the end of the Kali Yuga. Pond of the temple Legends According to the legend, attracted by the music from Narada‚Äôs Veena, Lord Vishnu started following him and reached Satyaloka. Seeing Lord Vishnu, Brahma prostrated before him. Lord Vishnu soon realized that he has reached Satyaloka but did not realize that Lord Brahma is prostrating before him and left back to Vaikunta. It seemed as if Lord Brahma is falling towards the feet of Narada and all the present 'Devas' laughed. This made Brahma angry and he cursed Devas to be born as humans in the earth. Devas repented their folly and begged to be forgiven. Brahma replied that the curse would be withdrawn when they do a penance to please Lord Janardana. Devas asked where that place is where they should do the penance. Brahma told them that the place where Sage Narada‚Äôs ‚ÄòVastra‚Äô falls will be the sacred place. It is Varkala where his ‚ÄòVastra‚Äô fell and Devas did the penance accordingly to get relieved of the curse. According to Mahabharata, Balabhadran has visited the place for pilgrimage. Rituals JanardhanaSwamy Temple Entrance Offering obeisances to the departed souls and forefathers is a very important ritual. Four poojas are conducted in a day by the priest. The chief priest is a Tulu Brahmin, who should not be a native of the place where the temple exists. Sub-deities are Ganapathi, Shastha, Ananthan (Nagam) Shiva, Chandikesha, and Hanuman. A ten-day festival with Arattu is conducted on the Malayalam month of Meenam on the day of Uthram. Geography Janardana Swami Temple is located at .

Although a major supporter of Byzantine empress Irene of Athens (), soon after her overthrow he was appointed by Nikephoros as commander-in-chief of the Anatolian armies. From this position, he launched a revolt in July 803, probably in opposition to Nikephoros's economic and religious policies. His troops marched towards Constantinople, but failed to win popular support. At this point, some of his major supporters deserted him and, reluctant to engage the loyalist forces in battle, Bardanes gave up and chose to surrender himself. He retired as a monk to a monastery he had founded. There he was blinded, possibly on Nikephoros's orders. Origin and early career solidus of Empress Irene, during the period of her sole rule (797‚Äì802). Nothing is known of the early life of Bardanes. He is usually regarded by modern scholars as an Armenian on account of his first name (a Hellenized form of Vardan), whilst his sobriquet \\"Tourkos\\", which was bestowed upon him, probably disparagingly, only after his revolt, could suggest a Khazar origin.; . Bardanes is probably identical with the patrikios Bardanios who appears in the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid-790s. In 795, he was Domestic of the Schools (commander of the Scholai guards), and was dispatched to arrest the monk Plato of Sakkoudion for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI () to Plato's niece Theodote. In 797, as strategos (military governor) of the Thracesian Theme, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her son.; ; ; . On Easter Monday, 1 April 799, he is recorded as one of the four patrikioi (along with Niketas Triphyllios, Sisinnios Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas) who led the horses of the Empress's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles.; . Irene herself was overthrown and exiled by the logothetes tou genikou (finance minister) Nikephoros on 31 October 802. At the time, Bardanes was still patrikios and strategos of the Thracesians, but was soon transferred to command the powerful Anatolic Theme. In the next year, probably in preparation for a campaign against the Arabs following Nikephoros's refusal to continue the annual payment of tribute to the Abbasid Caliphate, the Emperor apparently appointed Bardanes to the post of monostrategos (\\"single- general\\", in effect commander-in-chief) of the Empire's five Anatolian land themes, only conferred in exceptional cases.; ; , Chapter 1 ; . However, this appointment is by no means certain; he is mentioned as monostrategos only by later sources, while near-contemporary ones mention him only as strategos of the Anatolics. It is possible that later sources misinterpreted his title to mean \\"general of all the East (Anatole)\\".. Revolt Gold solidus of Nikephoros I and his son and co-emperor, Staurakios. In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, a son of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (), began advancing towards the Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme.. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up with the rest of the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory of hostility towards him amongst its troops.; ; , Chapter 2.1 . Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.; ; . For the motives of Bardanes himself, the situation is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers to allow him to leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, Thomas the Slav, Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. Although possibly a later invention, this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand.; ; ; , Note #4 . Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was also a member of the landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros's policies, both in the confessional area, where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests.. Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros's usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death, however, at Lesbos on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy.. Byzantine Asia Minor and the Byzantine-Arab frontier region at the time of Thomas's revolt The revolt probably took place at Amorion, the capital of the Anatolic Theme. From there, the rebel army, comprising almost half of the Empire's available military forces, marched north and west, following the military road to Nicomedia and then to Chrysopolis, the town that lay across the Bosporus from the imperial capital, Constantinople. There, Bardanes encamped for eight days, awaiting a possible uprising against Nikephoros inside the capital in response to his own rebellion. Since this did not materialize, and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic, he withdrew to the great army base at Malagina. There, two of his associates, Michael the Amorian and Leo the Armenian, abandoned him, and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection: Michael became Count of the Tent to the Emperor, and Leo was appointed commander of the Foederati regiment.; ; ; , Chapter 2.1 . This desertion further discouraged Bardanes, and, reluctant to face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that neither he nor his subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. As a further guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter.; ; ; , Chapter 2.2 . Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on a ship that took him to the island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past. Aftermath of the revolt After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros formally dismissed him and confiscated much of his property. The other thematic generals who took part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year.; ; ; , Chapter 3 . In December 803 (Treadgold puts it in 804), however, a group of \\"Lycaonian\\" (possibly Paulician) soldiers disembarked at Prote and blinded Bardanes.. This was a highly symbolic act: blinding was the usual punishment usually meted out to heretics and rebels, or to deposed emperors and other political rivals to prevent them from becoming a threat.. It is very likely that this was done at the behest of the Emperor himself, although in a later public statement before the Senate, Nikephoros swore that he had nothing to do with it. Most scholars believe in Nikephoros's direct involvement, but Treadgold holds it likelier that the soldiers acted on their own, since Bardanes was no longer a credible threat to the Emperor. In the event, despite pressure from the Patriarch and the Senate to punish the perpetrators, and his own pledge to do so, Nikephoros let them go.; ; . Bardanes's revolt temporarily weakened Byzantium, especially in its capability to deal with the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia.; , Chapter 3 . Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.. Family Bardanes was married to a woman named Domnika, with whom he had several children. Thekla, the wife of Michael the Amorian, is usually identified with one of them, as Theophanes Continuatus and Genesius record that Bardanes married two of his daughters to Michael the Amorian and another of his aides.; . Warren Treadgold identifies the second daughter with a woman named or nicknamed Barka, whom he regards as the first wife of Leo the Armenian and whom Leo divorced shortly after his accession in 813 in order to marry Theodosia. She would then be the real mother of Leo's firstborn son, Symbatios/Constantine.. Theodosia, however, is the only clearly attested wife of Leo, and there is no evidence for a divorce and remarriage. Leo is also named the \\"cousin\\" of Bardanes, but it is unclear whether this is literal or in the meaning of \\"brother in law\\". If the former is the case, the familial relationship alone would bar any such marriage. In addition, the tale is very likely simply a later invention, inspired by the marriage of Thekla to Michael the Amorian.; ; . A son by the name of Bryennios or Bryenes is known, who held a high official post in 813.. An unnamed, unmarried daughter is recorded, as well as several other unnamed younger children, in 803; along with Domnika, they were left a part of Bardanes's fortune, part of which was donated to the poor, and the rest used to found a small monastery in Constantinople, where they retired.; ; .

The formal theory is attributed to Zillmann & Bryant (1980) in their article, \\"Misattribution Theory of Tendentious Humor\\", published in Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. They derived the critical concepts of the theory from Sigmund Freud's Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious, originally published in 1905. Freud declared people incapable of knowing exactly what it is they find amusing due to the complex nature of their conscious and subconscious minds. Jokes are crafted by comedians who have experience with causing laughter but who may themselves be blind to the actual cause of humor. Tendentious vs. innocuous humor Freud made a key distinction between tendentious and non-tendentious humor. Tendentious humor involves a \\"victim\\", someone at whose expense we laugh. Non-tendentious humor does not require a victim. This innocuous humor typically depends on wordplay, and Freud believed it has only modest power to evoke amusement. Tendentious humor, then, is the only kind that can evoke big laughs. However, Freud believed a mixture of both tendentious and non-tendentious humor is required to keep the tendentious humor from becoming too offensive or demeaning to its victim. The innocent jokework of the innocuous humor would mask the otherwise hostile joke and therefore \\"bribe\\" our senses, allowing us to laugh at what would otherwise be socially unacceptable. Therefore, we often think we are laughing at innocuous jokes, but what really makes them funny is their socially unacceptable nature hidden below the surface. Empirical study To further examine Freud's concepts, media scholars Dolf Zillmann & Jennings Bryant set up an experimental situation to combine and/or separate tendentious and non-tendentious humor. Their findings confirmed the expectations that amusement was highest when all of the ingredients of good comedy were present. In conjunction with disposition theory of mirth (Zillmann & Cantor, 1976), audiences predictably enjoyed witnessing the demise of a disliked character. However, the mere presence of the innocuous humor cue more than doubled the amusement in response to the observed misfortune. The applications to humor in film, television, and other media are quite apparent. However, very little research has been conducted to follow up Zillmann & Bryant's original experiment. Example in today's comedy Sitcom and comedy films are filled with humor based on misattribution. For example, characters in a working-class family may banter back and forth about paying bills or finding a more respected or higher-paying job. The delivery of dialog may come across as funny for an audience who believes the humor comes from the antagonistic relationship between the two characters. But the real hostile nature of the joke involves class and economic issues that are otherwise not funny. Similar analysis can be applied to issues involving racial discrimination, sexual deviancy, drug abuse, and other controversial issues. See also * Misattribution of arousal References * Freud, S.

The painting shows the actor and stage manager David Garrick in the role of Richard III in Shakespeare's play Richard III. It depicts a dramatic moment in the play on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth (1485). The king, who had been asleep in his tent on the battlefield, has just woken from a dream in which he has seen the ghosts of the opponents he had previously murdered. Hogarth was a friend of Garrick, who had gained a degree of fame through his portrayal of Richard III at the Drury Lane Theatre in London. The painting shows the actor with fear and concern, one arm raised and with a shocked expression on his face. Hogarth, best remembered for his satirical prints on social themes, was also a skilled painter and portraitist. This painting, much more than just a portrait, shows the subject at a key time in history, and also in theatrical pose. It falls between the commonly accepted genres of portraiture and historical painting. The pose used by Hogarth was similar to other that used for other portraits of actors, especially those by Zoffany. Having compared Hogarth's painting with those of Garrick by Reynolds, Gill Parry concludes that Hogarth had helped to establish a new subgenre within portraiture, that of the theatrical portrait. The pose adopted by the actor was described by Hogarth as \\"the serpentine line\\"; he saw it as \\"being composed of two curves contrasted\\". In his 1753 treatise The Analysis of Beauty he suggests that this is a particularly beautiful shape which \\"gives play to the imagination and delights the eye\\". The painting is in oil on canvas and measures by . It is owned by the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and was purchased by the gallery in 1956 with help from the National Art Collections Fund.

She is co-director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet). She organized and directs the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC). Kopell received her B.A. from Cornell University in 1963 and her Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1967. She held visiting positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France (1970), MIT (1975, 1976-1977), and the California Institute of Technology (1976). The focus of her research is the field of applied biomathematics and includes use of mathematical models to analyze the physiological mechanisms of brain dynamics. The techniques Kopell uses include extensions of invariant manifold theory, averaging theory, and geometric methods for singularly perturbed equations. From the peak of her career in 1990, she has contributed to over 200 published research articles in the field of biomathematics. Her current interests include topics such as: how does the brain produce its dynamics (physiological mechanisms), how do brain rhythms take part in cognition (sensory processing, attention, memory, motor control), and how can pathologies of brain dynamics help to understand symptoms of neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy) as well as alternate states of consciousness (anesthesia). She collaborates widely with experimentalists and clinicians in order to conduct research on these topics. Kopell is a 1990 MacArthur Fellow. Biography = Early life and education = Kopell was born on November 8, 1942 and grew up on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. Her father was an accountant and her mother and older sister also majored in mathematics. In 1963, she graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in mathematics. She then went on to earn an M.A. and Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. From a young age, she was exposed to mathematics. Her mother was a mathematics major, her father worked as an accountant, and her older sister studied math. As a child, she had a severe eye problem which taught her how to cope with being \\"different.\\" This ability to cope would help her successfully deal with feelings of marginalization she would later experience as a female scientist. She attributes her professional success to this ability as well as the support she received from mentors throughout her career. Her high school teachers encouraged her to go into the mathematics field. During her undergraduate education at Cornell University, she registered for a mathematics honors program, and was the only female participant. She considered several majors, such as economics and chemistry, but chose to major in math. Kopell graduated from Cornell with an A.B. in 1963. She then decided to attend graduate school in order to \\"find an alternative to the more traditional life her family expected for her.\\" Kopell originally applied to programs on the East Coast and was admitted to all of them except for one; however, after being encouraged by another student, she chose to attend school on the West Coast instead. She was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, with a fellowship and graduated with an M.A. and a Ph.D. in 1967. At Berkeley, she did well on her exams and was known as the \\"bright female.\\" However, she struggled in the early stages of her dissertation work and switched supervisors to Stephen Smale. Smale suggested a problem which Kopell almost singlehandedly solved, leading to her thesis in the field of dynamical systems which catapulted her career. = Academic career = After completing her graduate education, Kopell accepted an instructorship at MIT. There, she met collaborator Lou Howard, with whom she published several articles. She later met her husband, Gabriel Stolzenberg, at Boston University. While Kopell did her thesis work in theoretical mathematics, she later switched to applied mathematics. In 1969, she joined Northeastern University as faculty, becoming a full professor in 1978. In 1986, she became a professor of mathematics at Boston University and in 2009 she became the first woman at Boston University to be named a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor. She was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1990 for her work developing methods of dynamical systems to attack problems of applied mathematics. She is currently Director and Co-Founder of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, which consists of a group of over two dozen labs, mostly in the Boston Area, working on brain dyanmics and their cognitive implications. She is also Co-Director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet). Kopell is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was recently selected to be an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society, a distinction given to one or two mathematicians per year worldwide. She has been awarded Sloan Guggenheim, and McArthur Fellowships, and has an honorary Ph.D. from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. She has given the Weldon Memorial Prize Lecture (Oxford), the von Neumann Lecture (SIAM) and the Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecture (AMS), as well as multiple other named lectureships.

Bana'ah BANNAAH, BANNAY, BANNAYAH, jewishencyclopedia.com; Article(; or R. Benaiah, , both derived from the word ◊ë◊†◊ô◊î, Benaia ('bniya'), lit. construction or building; was a rabbi who lived in the early 3rd century, during the intermediate period between the Tannaim and the Amoraim. Biography His description of the speech in his place of origin suggests he may have come from outside the Land of Israel.In Yerushalmi Shabbat 10:6 he says that \\"in our place (◊ë◊ê◊™◊®◊ô◊ü) people call braiding 'building'\\", while according to Berachot 61a, \\"in overseas cities people call braiding 'building'\\". However, Breishit Rabbah 18a records Bannaah as saying \\"there are places\\", not \\"in our place\\", in which case nothing can be derived of his native place. Bannaah apparently lived in Tiberias, and his pupils included Johanan ben Nappaha.Yerushalmi Shabbat 12:3; Yerushalmi Horayot 3:4. Berachot 55b speaks of him being in Jerusalem, but Dikdukei Sofrim indicates a different text. The following story is told: \\"Bannaah was in the habit of marking tombs, in order that persons might guard themselves against ritual impurity. Once he arrived at the Cave of the Patriarchs . At the entrance he found Eliezer (Abraham's servant) and, being announced by him, then entered. When Bannaah endeavored to view the grave of Adam, which was situated in the same cave, a voice came from heaven, saying: 'You may look upon the image of My image [Jacob], but not upon My direct image [Adam].' But Bannaah had already seen the soles of Adam's feet, which were similar to two suns.\\"Bava Batra 58a Teachings Not much of a halakhic nature from him has been preserved; but he is distinguished as one of the great aggadists of his time. =Halacha= Regarding Bannaah's relation to Judah haNasi, the following utterance is characteristic: \\"Man should ever penetrate deep into the study of the Mishnah; for if he knock it will be opened to him, be it the Talmud [= halakhah] or the aggadah\\".Pesikta Rabbati 27 176a; compare Matthew 7:7: \\"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you\\" Bannaah therefore belongs to the few of the semi-tannaim who fully acknowledged the value in Judah's collection of the Mishnah, regarding it as a progressive step in the development of the tannaitic literature.Compare Yerushalmi Horayot 3 48c He was willing to decide court cases by estimate without tangible proof. In a story similar to the Judgment of Solomon, it is recorded that he was called to decide on the inheritance of a man who died with one legitimate and nine mamzer sons. The father had left a will granting all his possessions \\"to one son\\" without specifying which. Banaah told the sons to go and beat the father's grave until the father returned to life and told them who was intended. One son refused to do this, and Banaah rewarded the inheritance to him. The remaining sons complained to the Byzantine government, which imprisoned Banaah, until his wife managed to get him freed.See Tzvi Yehudah Ben Yaakov, \\"Pesikat haDin al pi Umdena\\", in Shanah beShanah (Heichal Shlomo, Jerusalem , 1998 He ruled that while owners of a shared courtyard could prevent each other from using the courtyard for various purposes, they could not prevent female owners from doing laundry there, as it was considered disrespectable for Jewish women to have to do laundry in public.Bava Batra 57b, Yerushalmi Nedarim 5:1 He insisted on rabbis dressing formally;Bava Batra 58a his student Rabbi Yochanan, too, seems to have adopted this practice.Shabbat 113a =Aggadah= He said that the Biblical Joshua acted \\"in accordance with the spirit of the Law as revealed by God to Moses, also in instances when not directly instructed by the latter\\",Yerushalmi Peah 1 15b which may also reflect his attitude towards halacha in general. His view on the origin of the Pentateuch is remarkable as almost bordering on Biblical criticism. \\"The Torah was given in rolls\\",Gittin 60a i.e. separate sections, which were afterward joined into a unity. In aggadic exegesis, Bannaah frequently applies symbolism. For instance, he thinks that God demanded gold for the Tabernacle, in order that Israel might in this way do penance for the sin committed in worshiping the golden calf.Sifre, Deuteronomy 1 The following words of Bannaah are also noteworthy: \\"Saul began to subtilize over the order which he had received to exterminate Amalek. 'If the men have sinned,' said he, 'in what manner have the women, the children, or the cattle?' Whereupon there came a voice from heaven that cried, 'Be not righteous overmuch',Ecclesiastes 7:16 that is, 'Be not more just than thy Creator'\\".Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:16; and compare Jerome's commentary, ad loc. =Quotes= * Whoever occupies himself with the Torah for its own sake - his learning becomes an elixir of life to him, for it is said, 'It is a tree of life to those who grasp it';Proverbs 3:18 and it is further said, 'It shall be as health to your navel';Proverbs 3:8 and it is also said, 'For whoever finds me, finds life'.Proverbs 8:35 But, whoever occupies himself with the Torah not for its own sake - it becomes to him a deadly poison, as it is said, 'My doctrine shall drop [ya'arof] as the rain',Deuteronomy 32:2 and ‚Äòarifa‚Äò surely means death, as it is said, 'And they shall break [ve'arfu] the heifer's neck there in the valley'Deuteronomy 21:4.\\"Taanit 7a References =Jewish Encyclopedia Bibliography= * Bacher, Ag.

It was much favoured during the 18th and 19th centuries by cricketers playing at the nearby Thomas Lord's grounds, including as William Beldham, Tom Walker and David Harris, and was also patronised by the leading bookmakers of the day. The tavern was originally situated at 335 Oxford Street, between Argyll Street and Queen Street (which no longer exists) and was also a coaching inn (a 1792 map shows it at the entrance to a stagecoach yard), the start point/terminus of several stage coach routes out of London. By 1852 it was also a parcel office for the London & North-Western Railway and in 1864 the established coaching firm of Chaplin & Horne took over the office, which had most likely stopped being a tavern by this date. In 1882, this office apparently closed and moved to 241 Oxford Street: however, as the current 241 premises (following the renumbering of Oxford Street during the late 19th century redevelopment) are barely 100 feet further west down the street, it couldn't have been too arduous a move. The building at 241 was purchased in 1898 by the Baker St & Waterloo Railway and demolished in February 1901, by which time the office had relocated to 151 Oxford Street (between Berwick Street and Poland Street), retaining the 'Green Man & Still' name as late as the early 1920s.

It is defined in the TimeML Specification version 1.2.1 developed by several efforts, led in large part by the Laboratory for Linguistics and Computation at Brandeis University. The TimeML project's goal is to create a standard markup language for temporal events in a document. TimeML addresses four problems regarding event markup, including time stamping (with which an event is anchored to a time), ordering events with respect to one another, reasoning with contextually underspecified temporal expressions, and reasoning about the length of events and their outcomes. History TimeML was conceptualized in 2002 during the TERQAS (Time and Event Recognition for Question Answering Systems) workshops, organized by Professor James Pustejovsky of Brandeis University. The TERQAS Workshops set out to address the problem of how to enhance natural language question answering systems to answer temporally-based questions about the events and entities in news articles. During these workshops, TimeML version 1.0 was defined, and the TimeBank corpus was created as an illustration. In 2003, the TANGO (TimeML Annotation Graphical Organizer) workshops produced a graphical annotation tool for TimeML. The TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reasoning Systems for Question Interpretation) project currently develops algorithms that tag events and time expressions in natural language texts, anchor them temporally, and order them. = Versions = According to the official TimeML website, there are currently three versions of the TimeML specification language, although it is rumored that other versions exist.  Version 1.1  TimeML version 1.1 was produced in 2004.  Version 1.2  TimeML version 1.2 was produced in 2004, shortly after the release of version 1.1.  Version 1.2.1  In 2005, version 1.2.1 was defined. There were several changes made to the language, and are described in the version 1.2.1 TimeML guideline as such: *The nf_morph attribute that was part of MAKEINSTANCE has been changed to pos (part of speech), and the PRESPART, PASTPART, and INFINITIVE elements of nf_morph redistributed to tense. *The optional syntax attribute was added to SLINK, ALINK, and TLINK. Syntax can be used to hold CDATA, but is generally only used by annotation programs to hold the data that led to the creation of the tag. *The optional comment attribute was added to all TimeML elements, for the purpose of giving (human) annotators a place to put observations about annotated text.  ISO- TimeML  ISO-TimeML was presented to the ISO for consideration as a standard in August 2007. It was then revised, voted on, and approved as an international standard by March 2009.

It declares that the rest of the document surrounded by the TIMEML tag is encoded with TimeML tags. = EVENT = The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that mark the semantic events described by it. Syntactically, EVENTs are typically verbs, although event nominals, such as \\"crash\\" in \\"...killed by the crash\\", will also be annotated as EVENTs. The EVENT tag is also used to annotate a subset of the states in a document. This subset of states includes those that are either transient or explicitly marked as participating in a temporal relation. See the TimeML annotation guidelines for more details. = TIMEX3 = The TIMEX3 tag is primarily used to mark up explicit temporal expressions, such as times, dates, durations, etc. It is modeled on Setzer's (2001) TIMEX tag, as well as the TIDES (Ferro, et al. (2002)) TIMEX2 tag. Since it differs both in attribute structure and in use, it seemed best to give it a separate name, which reveals its heritage while at the same time indicating that it is different from its forebears. = SIGNAL = The SIGNAL tag represents a temporal signal. These are any function words that suggest a particular temporal relationship. Example SIGNALs are: when, in, after. = TLINK = TLINKS, or Temporal Links establish relationships between two or more events for the purpose of ordering them in time. Temporal links are the most prevalent as they show how the TimeML elements (events and temporal expressions) are temporally related to each other. = ALINK = Events that are marked as ASPECTUAL introduce an ALINK or Aspectual Link. These links are quite straightforward as they only occur when an aspectual event has another event as an argument. For example, in the sentence \\"Mary completed the marathon\\", \\"completed\\" is an aspectual event while marathon is an occurrence. = SLINK = Like the ALINK, SLINKs (Subordinate Links) are only introduced by certain event classes, namely reporting events, intensional events (I ACTION and I STATE), and perception events. Additionally, these events must subordinate another event by taking it as an argument. SLINKs are used essentially to allow for temporal relationships to be given even for events that may or may not have happened. For example, reporting events such as \\"said\\" introduce an EVIDENTIAL SLINK. Consider the sentence \\"\\"He didn‚Äôt even stop,‚Äù one witness said\\". Here the \\"stop\\" event is being subordinated by the \\"said\\" event.

Background  In early 1636, the experienced Flemish admiral, Jacob Collaert, commander of the Armada of Flanders, the fleet of the Dunkirkers, was defeated by five warships of the Dutch blocking fleet under Captain Johan Evertsen.Fern√°ndez Duro p. 408 His galleon and another vessel were sunk after a prolonged engagement off the French coast, near Dieppe, and he was captured along with 200 of his men.Stradling p. 87 After an exchange of prisoners he was freed, but died of an illness at A Coru√±a shortly after. The Navarrese Miguel de Horna replaced him. Horna also proved to be a skillful commander, as he destroyed three major enemy convoys in less than two years, winning the actions of the Lizard, Mardyck and the Channel.Laughton/Anderson/Perrin p. 265  Battle  Miguel de Horna sailed from Dunkirk on 18 February, in command of a squadron of five ships and two frigates, to attack the Dutch fishing fleet and trade routes. His captains were the Basque Antonio de Anciondo, the Flemish Marcus van Oben and Cornelis Meyne, and the Castilians Antonio D√≠az and Salvador Rodr√≠guez. After capturing a merchant ship while under fire from the coastal batteries of Calais, the Spanish squadron crossed the English Channel. An Anglo-Dutch convoy of 28 Dutch merchantmen and 16 English merchantmen, escorted by six Dutch warships, was sighted off Lizard Point, on the coast of Cornwall. The Spanish warships rapidly proceeded to attack, approaching the convoy under heavy fire from the escorting warships. Soon after the convoy escort was engaged by the Spanish, the Dutch flagship was completely disabled by heavy cannon and musketry fire from Horna's flagship. Antonio D√≠az's ship managed to board her and capture her flag, but the assault was ultimately repulsed. A second attempt from Horna's ship, which lasted half an hour, also failed, but with the help of a third Spanish ship under Cornelis Meyne, the Dutch flagship was finally captured.Fern√°ndez Duro p. 410 Although the merchants used their cannon to help the Dutch warships, three were nevertheless sunk. The remaining two surrendered and were captured. The convoy ships dispersed and tried to escape individually, taking advantage of the smoke of battle and the darkness of the night. However, 14 of them fell into Spanish hands and were taken to Dunkirk with the three captured warships.  Aftermath  Horna returned to Dunkirk escorting 17 prizes fully loaded with ammunitions and supplies. He avoided the Dutch lieutenant-admiral, Philips van Dorp, who had been sent to intercept with 20 warships. Dorp attempted to blockade the Spanish fleet in the port, but Horna was able to continue his campaigns without difficulties. In July, he ambushed two Dutch Bordeaux convoys, carrying off 12 prizes loaded with, amongst other items, 125 valuable cavalry horses. The convoy coming from Venice to Amsterdam was also captured, as well as 14 ships of the Dutch East India Company and eight which carried gifts to Louis XIII of France. In a later exploit, the Action of 18 February 1639, when he was attacked by a Dutch fleet of 17 ships, Horna managed to help a Spanish convoy escape, despite his numerical inferiority.

There are two audtoria in the building - the 675 seat main auditorium and the 60 seat Studio Theatre, originally named The Ralph Richardson Studio after Ralph Richardson. History The Grade II listed building was designed by Frank Matcham and was originally called \\"The New Theatre and Opera House\\". It was opened on 1 October 1891 with a performance by Lilly Langtry in 'Lady Clancarty'. When it was first built, the theatre seated around 1500 people on bench seating. In 1929, the New Theatre and Opera House gained a licence to screen projected film, becoming a multi-purpose theatre and cinema. The licence stipulated that the building must continue to present live performance as well as cinema. In World War Two, the theatre became a Garrison Theatre, continuing to present theatre throughout the war years to civilians and the US soldiers based at Pittville. Many actors from London left the capital to escape the Blitz, bringing big names to Cheltenham. The Cheltenham Corporation ran the building after World War II until 1960. In 1959 the building closed and was at risk of being sold. The Cheltenham Theatre Association published an advertisement in September 1959 advertising \\"Urgent - Wanted ¬£3,000 at once, to re-open Cheltenham Opera House\\". left In May 1960, the Cheltenham Theatre Association published another advertisement titled \\"Great News\\", which announced that the Everyman Theatre would open on Monday 22 May 1960 with a world premiere presentation of N.C. Hunter's \\"A Piece of Silver\\", starring Joyce Heron and Esmond Knight. The Cheltenham Theatre Association still runs today as the Everyman Theatre Association (ETA) and is a Registered Charity, No. 240273. On re-opening in 1960, the Everyman Theatre operated as a Repertory Theatre, with several household names being part of the rep, including William Gaunt, Steven Berkoff, Windsor Davies and Penelope Keith. The theatre closed in 1983 to coincide with the development of the Regent Arcade, during which the building underwent significant rebuilding and refurbishment. The theatre reopened in 1986 with a production of My Fair Lady, starring Jacqueline Dankworth. The Everyman Theatre is the oldest surviving working Matcham Auditorium. 2011 Refurbishment left In 2011, the theatre closed in early May for a ¬£3.2 million refurbishment. During the refurbishment, the main auditorium was restored and returned to a decorative style resembling Frank Matcham's original style, including bespoke wallpaper and carpets, painting by fine arts and replacement of cherubs around the auditorium. The pink paint on the iconic narrow and high Opera House proscenium arch was removed to reveal the original Scagliola marble. Above the proscenium arch, the spandrels were restored to put original paintings representing the angels of Comedy and Tragedy back in place. The theatre reopened in September 2011 with a performance by Sir Ken Dodd.

He is notable for his defeat of Sir Cahir O'Doherty's forces at the 1608 Battle of Kilmacrennan during O'Doherty's Rebellion in Ireland. Family Sir Richard Wingfield was the son of Sir Richard Wingfield, Governor of Portsmouth, who was descended from an old Suffolk family, and Christian, daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam of Milton, Castor, Northamptonshire, and sister of Sir William Fitzwilliam, Lord Deputy of Ireland. He became the step-son of Sir George Delves, after his mother's remarriage. Early career He came to Ireland as a military adventurer in the latter part of the 16th century and afterwards fought in Flanders, France and Portugal, gaining the military rank of lieutenant colonel. Returning to Ireland, Wingfield distinguished himself and was wounded in an expedition against Tyrone, and was knighted by the Lord Deputy, William Russell, in Christ Church Cathedral on 9 November 1595. He served as a colonel in the expedition against Calais, and in 1600 was advanced to the office of Marshal of Ireland, with a retinue of fifty horse and a company of foot. In 1601 he led a force at the reduction of Kinsale, and was one of those who signed the articles of capitulation made between the Lord Deputy of Ireland and Don Juan del √Åguila, commander of the Spanish troops made prisoners on that occasion. O'Doherty's Rebellion In May 1608 during O'Doherty's Rebellion he marched into Ulster against Sir Cahir O'Doherty, who had burnt Derry, killing him and dispersing his followers. For this success Sir Richard was on 29 June 1609 rewarded by a grant of the Powerscourt Estate in County Wicklow. Later career In the Parliament of Ireland of 1613‚Äì15, he sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Downpatrick. On 19 February 1618 he was created Viscount Powerscourt, and he subsequently enjoyed several important offices under the Crown. Marriage He married Frances Rugge, (or Repps), (died before 30 November 1631), daughter of William Rugge, (or Repps), of Felmingham, Norfolk, and Thomasine Townshend, and widow of Edward Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell. Frances Cromwell, the elder of her two daughters, married Sir John Wingfield of Tickencote, Rutland in January 1619. Her younger daughter, Anne Cromwell, married her husband's cousin, Sir Edward Wingfield of Carnew, County Wicklow on 9 May 1619. Death He died 9 September 1634, without issue from his wife, Frances and his title therefore became extinct. His estates passed to his cousin, Sir Edward Wingfield. The title was revived in 1665 in the person of Folliott Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt, who died without issue in 1717; and again in 1743 for Richard Wingfield.

(833-873)  Background  It is not known when Du Shenquan was born. He was a sixth-generation descendant of the early Tang Dynasty chancellor Du Ruhui.Old Book of Tang, vol. 177.New Book of Tang, vol. 96.Both Du Shenquan's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang indicated that he was a direct descendant of Du Ruhui's. However, the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang indicated that Du Shenquan was descended from Du Ruhui's cousin Du Jingtong (ÊùúÊï¨Âêå), whose father Du Yan also briefly served as chancellor. See New Book of Tang, vol. 72. His grandfather Du Zuo () served as a judge at the supreme court. His uncle Du Yuanying served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Muzong, while his father Du Yuanjiang () served as an advisor for a crown prince. Both Du Shenquan and his younger brother Du Wei () passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. He thereafter served as an assistant to the governor of Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), and, after subsequently passing a special imperial examination for those who made good rulings, remained at the capital Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (), a low-level advisory official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). He was later promoted to Zuo Bujue (), an advisory official at the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng).  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  Early in the Dazhong era (847-860) of Emperor Muzong's younger brother Emperor XuƒÅnzong, Du Shenquan was made Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu), and then was promoted to supervisor (ÈÉé‰∏≠, Langzhong). He was later put in charge of drafting edicts, and later made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid- level official at the legislative bureau. In 856, he was put in charge of determining the passage for imperial examinees at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu, note different tone), and in 857, he selected some 30 of them; it was said that many of them became prominent officials later. He was thereafter made the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). That winter, he was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). In 859, he was recalled to serve as the deputy minister of census (), in charge of taxation.Old Book of Tang, vol. 18, part 2.  During Emperor Yizong's reign  Emperor XuƒÅnzong died later in 859 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong. Thereafter, Du Shenquan was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality, but almost immediately thereafter recalled to serve as the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) and the director of finances, and then made a chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 1. Because, during the time he served as chancellor, the more senior official Du Cong also served as chancellor, Du Shenquan became known colloquially as \\"Little Duke Du.\\" Du Shenquan served as chancellor until 863, when he was sent to Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to serve as its military governor, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary chancellor title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. During the subsequent 868-869 rebellion by the officer Pang Xun, who seized Xusi Circuit (ÂæêÊ≥ó, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and attacked nearby circuits, Du, along with fellow military governors Linghu Tao (of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu)) and Cui Xuan (of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei)) ensured that the supply route for Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang was continued to be open despite the rebellion. He also sent troops under his officer Zhai Xingyue () to try to lift the siege that Pang's followers Wu Jiong () and Liu Ji () put Si Prefecture (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu) under, although Zhai and his soldiers were subsequently annihilated by the rebels. When Xin Dang (), a friend of Si's prefect Du Tao (), subsequently fought his way out of the siege to seek aid from Linghu and Du Shenquan, Du sent another officer, Zhao Yi (), with 2,000 soldiers and a supply of rice and salt, to join forces with Linghu to try to again lift the siege. Xin, along with the Huai'nan and Zhenhai soldiers, were able to fight their way back into the siege to assist its defense, and subsequently, Ma Ju (), who had by that point succeeded Linghu as the military governor of Huai'nan, was able to defeat the rebels and lift the siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 251. After Pang was defeated and killed, for his contributions, Du Shenquan was given the honorary title of acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies), and subsequently recalled to Chang'an to serve as Zuo Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). He was also created the Duke of Xiangyang. In 870, he was again sent to Hezhong Circuit to serve as its military governor, as well as the mayor of Hezhong. He served there for a few years before he was transferred to Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan). Yet later, he was made a senior advisor to the Crown Prince,However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. with his office at Luoyang. It is not known when he died,However, it is known that Du Shenquan's son Du Rangneng was created the Duke of Xiangyang in or shortly after 886, implying that Du Shenquan was no longer alive by that point. but it is known that after he died, he was given posthumous honors, as well as the posthumous name of De (Âæ∑, \\"virtuous\\"). His son Du Rangneng later served as a chancellor under Emperor Yizong's sons Emperor Xizong and Emperor Zhaozong.

The earthquake triggered a tsunami which caused the destruction of Talcahuano. A total of at least 50 people died from the effects of the earthquake and the tsunami. The earthquake caused damage from San Fernando in the north to Osorno in the south. It was felt over a still wider area from Copiap√≥ in the north to the island of Chiloe in the south and as far west as the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. Tectonic setting Chile lies above the convergent boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate, with a convergence rate of 66 mm/yr. This boundary has been the site of many historical megathrust earthquakes, including the largest earthquake ever recorded. The rupture area of the 1835 earthquake was noted as a prominent seismic gap, leading to a forecast of a large earthquake ( 8.0‚Äì8.5) within a few decades. The recent 2010 Chile earthquake appears to have ruptured this part of the plate interface. Damage Concepci√≥n was devastated, with most buildings being destroyed. A later survey found that 33% of kiln-dried brick buildings, 71% of mud-brick buildings and 95% of stone-built constructions were destroyed with all the rest being damaged. Despite this degree of damage only 50 people were reported dead. The low level of fatalities was attributed to the gradual increase in the intensity of shaking and that the earthquake occurred during the middle of the day, giving most of the inhabitants time to get clear. The destruction at Talcahuano was greater still due to the effects of the tsunami, which left only the lower parts of some buildings standing. A schooner was swept about 200 m inland, into the middle of the ruined town. There were few deaths, as the inhabitants had time to run up the hills behind the town. Characteristics =Earthquake= The shaking lasted for two minutes, with gradually increasing intensity. At least 300 aftershocks were noted during the next 12 days. The land was instantly uplifted along parts of the coast, as much as in places, although this was followed by subsidence in the following days. =Tsunami= There were three separate waves reported at Talcahuano, the first of which had a run-up of . The maximum run-up of was recorded at Coelemu. Remarks Charles Darwin was visiting the area while on the second voyage of HMS Beagle and recorded his observations of the earthquake in Valdivia and its effects and the subsequent tsunami in Concepci√≥n and Talcahuano. He remarked: Beagles captain, Robert FitzRoy, wrote a paper suggesting that the earthquake had affected the currents running along the South American coast. The paper was submitted to the Admiralty during the court martial of Captain Michael Seymour of HMS Challenger, whose ship was run ashore on rocks in May 1835 near the mouth of the Le√ºbu River.Gribbin, John and Mary. Fitzroy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004. . pp. 166‚Äì169.

Most signs are based on pictograms, except signs like the prohibition-sign for stop at customs and the sign indicating a taxi rank. If the sign includes text, the text is written in Finnish or Swedish, except the stop sign and taxi signs which are written in English (some taxi signs are written in Finnish). Many roads and places in Finland have Finnish and Swedish names, so both are marked on the traffic signs. This is common in the Swedish- speaking areas on the southern and western coasts, whereas in the inland Swedish names are far less common. In northern Lapland there are also traffic signs in the S√°mi language. At many unregulated intersections the practice is to yield to traffic on-coming from the right, unless there is a ‚Äúyield‚Äù or \\"give way‚Äù sign posted for the right on-coming traffic. This can be a problem on some streets since these signs are not always visible to traffic that does not have to yield. Therefore, unless a driver is experienced with the area and its signs, they should take care to give way to the right at an intersection, even if the road he or she is on appears to be the priority road. Finnish road signs depict gender-neutral people with realistic (as opposed to stylized) silhouettes. Major differences between Finnish and general European signs Whereas European signs usually have white background on warning and prohibition signs, Finnish signs have a yellow/orange colour. This is for the purpose of enhancing the visibility of the sign during the winter, as white signs would be hard to see in the snow. Prohibition signs displaying a symbol other than a numeric value have a diagonal red line across them. Prohibition signs in Slovenia and Sweden are similar in this respect.

Monckton was accompanied by Captain George Scott as well as New England Rangers led by Joseph Goreham, Captain Benoni Danks, as well as William Stark and Moses Hazen, both of Rogers' Rangers. Under the naval command of Silvanus Cobb, the British started at the bottom of the river with raiding Kennebecasis and Managoueche (City of Saint John), where the British built Fort Frederick. Then they moved up the river and raided Grimross (Gagetown, New Brunswick), Jemseg, and finally they reached Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas. The Acadian militia was led by French officer Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot and Acadian Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine. There were about 100 Acadian families on the Saint John River, with a large concentration at Ste Anne.Plank, p. 61 Most of them had taken refuge there from earlier deportation operations, such as the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign.Maxwell, p. 25. There were also about 1000 Maliseet.Patterson, p. 126 According to one historian, the level of Acadian suffering greatly increased in the late summer of 1758. Along with campaigns on Ile Saint-Jean, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, at Cape Sable and the Petitcodiac River Campaign, the British targeted the Saint John River.  Historical context  The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. ‚Ä¢ Boishebert (1753) Acadians had lived in the Saint John valley almost continuously since the early seventeenth century.Plank, p. 164 After the Conquest of Acadia (1710), Acadians migrated from peninsula Nova Scotia to the French-occupied Saint John River. These Acadians were seen as the most resistant to British rule in the region.Georrery Plank. An Unsettled Conquest. University of Pennsylvania. 2001. p. 100. The Saint John River residents had always proven effective at resisting the British. The Maliseet militia, from their base at Meductic, conducted effective warfare along with the Mi'kmaq militia against New England throughout the colonial wars. As late as 1748, there were only twelve French-speaking families living on the river. On October 28, 1748, at the end of King George's War, the Acadians and Mi'kmaq prevented John Gorham from landing to acquire an oath of allegiance. His rangers were fired upon killing three of the rangers and wounding three, while Gorham took two Mi'kmaq prisoner.p.574Pennsylvania Gazette September 21, 1749https://archive.org/stream/documentaryhisto23main#page/312/mode/2up/search/sablehttps://archive.org/stream/selectionsfrompu00nova#page/n200/mode/1up A Particular History of the Five Years French and Indian War in New England ... By Samuel Gardner Drake, William Shirlep. 174 In 1749, at the beginning of Father Le Loutre's War, Boishebert rebuked British naval officer John Rous at St. John. Boish√©bert built Fort Boishebert after withdrawing from the mouth of the Saint John River under the terms of an agreement arranged by Captain John Rous and Edward How. The fort was subsequently abandoned in 1751 by Ignace- Philippe Aubert de Gasp√© when the French reestablished their control and fortified the mouth of the Saint John River with Fort Menagoueche. In 1749, Boishebert assigned Acadian Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine to lead the Acadian militia in the St. John Region. In April 1755, while searching for a wrecked vessel at Port La Tour, Cobb discovered the French schooner Marguerite (Margarett), taking war supplies to the Saint John River for Boishebert at Fort Menagoueche. Cobb returned to Halifax with the news and was ordered by Governor Charles Lawrence to blockade the harbour until Captain William Kensey arrived in the warship HMS Vulture, and then to assist Kensey in capturing the French prize and taking it to Halifax. ‚Ä¢ During this time the British took captive a sergeant of Boishebert's detachment Grandcour, who was caught at the mouth of the river. Immediately after the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour (1755), Robert Monckton sent a detachment under the command of John Rous to take Fort Menagoueche. De Boishebert knew that he faced a superior force so he burned the fort, however, he maintained control of the river through guerrilla warfare. The destruction of Fort Menagoueche left Louisbourg as the last French fort in Acadia.Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications. 2003. p. 29 Boishebert made his first strike in the Battle of Petitcodiac. The first wave of these deportations began in 1755 with the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). During the expulsion, the Saint John River valley became the center of the Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British military in the region.Plank, p. 150 The leader of the resistance was French militia officer Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot. In February 1756, Governor Vaudreuil ordered Boishebert \\"to maintain, to the last extremity, the post on the River St. John.\\" On February 8, 1756, Acadians ambushed a British vessel at the mouth of the Saint John River, forcing it to return to Port Royal. He was stationed at Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas and from there issued orders for various raids such as the Raid on Lunenburg (1756) and the Battle of Petitcodiac (1755). He was also responsible to locate the Acadian refugees along the Saint John River. After the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), the second wave of the Expulsion of the Acadians began with the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign (campaign against present-day Prince Edward Island), and the removal of Acadians from Ile Royale (Cape Breton, Nova Scotia). As a result, Acadians fled these areas for the villages along the banks of the Saint John River, including the largest communities at Grimross (present day Gagetown, New Brunswick) and Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas. = Fort Frederick = Fort Frederick (1758) by Thomas Davies On September 13, 1758, Monckton and a strong force of regulars and rangers (Gorham's Rangers, Danks' Rangers and Rogers' Rangers) left Halifax and arrived at the mouth of the Saint John River a week later. While Fort Menagoueche had been destroyed (1755), when the British arrived, a few militia members fired shots from the site and fled upstream in boats. The armed sloop Providence was wrecked in the Reversing Falls trying to follow. Monckton established a new base of operations by reconstructing Fort Menagoueche, which he renamed Fort Frederick.Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications. 2003. p. 31; ; F. Th√©riault, p. 11 Establishing Fort Frederick allowed the British to virtually cut off the communications and supplies to the villages on the Saint John River.Plank, p. 68 Monckton was accompanied by the New England Rangers, which had three companies that were commanded by Joseph Goreham, Captain Benoni Danks and George Scott. When Monckton and his troops appeared on the Saint John River, Boish√©bert retreated. The Acadians were left virtually unprotected in their settlements at Grimross, Jemseg and Sainte-Anne des Pays- Bas. Boish√©bert directed Acadians to go to Quebec City, but many militiamen under Major Joseph Godin (Bellefontaine) chose to remain in Ste-Anne to defend their lands despite the English advances and numerical superiority.AD, Calvados (C√¶n), C 1 020, m√©moire de Joseph Bellefontaine, dit Beaus√©jour, 15 janv. 1774.‚Äî Placide Gaudet, Acadian genealogy and notes, APC Report, 1905, II, iiie partie :140, 241.‚Äî N.S.

This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians. On October 1 Monckton left Fort Frederick with his boats, regulars and rangers above the Reversing Falls. Two days later, they arrived at the village of Grimross. The village of 50 families that had migrated there in 1755 were forced to abandon their homes. Monckton's troops burned every building, torched the fields, and killed all the livestock. = Raid on Jemseg = Two days later, Monckton arrived at the village of Jemseg, New Brunswick and burned it to the ground. Then he returned to Fort Frederick at the mouth of the Saint John River. = Raid on Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas = St. John River, New Brunswick Monckton did not continue on to Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas (present day Fredericton, New Brunswick) because of the impending winter. Then, afraid of being trapped by the frozen river, he turned around at Maugerville and went back to Fort Frederick, and afterwards sailed for Halifax with thirty Acadian families as prisoners.Campbell, p. 29 Major Robert Morris was put in charge of the fort.Maxwell, p. 25 Almost three months later, in February 1759, Monckton sent Captain John McCurdy and his rangers out from Fort Frederick to go to Ste. Anne's Point on snow- shoes.[F. Th√©riault, p. 15. Captain McCurdy died of an accident along the way and was replaced by Lieutenant Moses Hazen. When the Acadians realized the British were going to continue their advance, most of them retreated to the Maliseet village at Aukpaque (Ecoupag) for protection. On 18 February 1759, Lieutenant Hazen and 22 men arrived at Sainte-Anne des Pays-Bas.Burt G. Loescher. Rogers Rangers: First Green Berets, p. 70 They pillaged and burned the village of 147 buildings, including two Mass-houses and all of the barns and stables. They burned a large store-house, and with it a large quantity of hay, wheat, peas, oats, etc., killing 212 horses, about 5 head of cattle, a large number of hogs and so forth. They also burned the church (located just west of Old Government House, Fredericton). Only a handful of Acadians were found in the area, most had already fled north with their families.; Also see Plank, p. 61 Captain George Scott by John Singleton Copley (c. 1758), The Brook In February 1759, Acadian militia leader Joseph Godin dit Bellefontaine and a group of Acadians ambushed the Rangers.Burt G. Loescher. Rogers Rangers: First Green Berets, p. 71 Eventually Godin and his militia was overwhelmed by Hazen's rangers. Godin resisted Hazen's efforts to get him to sign an oath of allegiance, even in the face of Hazen torturing and killing his daughter and 3 of his grandchildren in front of him. The rangers scalped six Acadians and took six prisoners during this raid. Godin \\"by his speech and largess . . . had instigated and maintained the Indians in their hatred and war against the English.\\" Godin was taken prisoner by the rangers and brought, after having been joined by his remaining family, to Annapolis Royal. From there he was taken to Boston, Halifax, and England; later he was sent to Cherbourg.AD, Calvados (Caen), C 1020, m√©moire de Joseph Bellefontaine, dit Beaus√©jour, 15 janv. 1774.

A letter from Fort Frederick which was printed in Parker's New York Gazette or Weekly Post-Boy on 2 April 1759 provides some additional details of the behavior of the rangers. Also see While the French military hired Natives to gather British scalps, the British military hired Rangers to gather Native scalps. The regiments of both the French and British militaries were not skilled at frontier warfare, while the Natives and rangers were. British officers Cornwallis and Amherst both expressed dismay over the tactics of the rangers and the Mi'kmaq (See , Faragher, p. 405).The scalping of Acadians in this instance was unique for the Maritimes. New Englanders had been scalping native peoples in the area for generations, but unlike the French on Ile Royale, they had refrained from authorizing the taking of scalps from individuals identified as being of European descent. See Plank, p. 67 (In response to Hazen scalping Godin's family members, General Amherst stated that Hazen had \\"sullied his merit with me\\".Amherst May 29, 1759) April 22, 1759, the Acadian militia took a ranger prisoner who was outside of Fort Frederick.https://archive.org/stream/sevenyearswarjou00flet#page/n55/mode/2up On 18 May 1759 a group of soldiers left the confines of Fort Frederick to go fishing. They were attacked by a group of native warriors and fled to the protection of the fort walls. One soldier did not make it and the natives carted him off.Plank, p. 66 Again on 15 June 1759, another party of soldiers was out fishing on the river and was ambushed by a militia of Acadians and natives. During the fight the soldiers fought from the confines of a sloop while others fired cannons from the fort. One of the soldiers was killed and scalped and another was badly wounded. The soldiers pursued the militia but was unable to find it. The command at Fort Frederick was not convinced the village was totally destroyed and sent at least three more expeditions up river to Ste Anne between July and September 1759. The soldiers captured some Acadians along the way, burned their homes, destroyed their crops and slaughtered their cattle. The September expedition involved more than 90 men. At present-day French Lake on the Oromocto River, on 8 September the Acadian militia ambushed the British rangers. This victory for the Acadian militia resulted in the deaths of at least 9 rangers and three severely wounded.Plank, p. 62, p. 66; Campbell, p. 31 (note that Campbell reports five rangers killed and eight wounded)p.352  Consequences  Because the British campaign destroyed their supplies, the few surviving Acadians in the area suffered famine. Canada's Governor Vaudreuil reported 1600 Acadians immigrated to Qu√©bec City in 1759. During this same winter, Quebec also suffered a famine and a smallpox epidemic broke out, killing over 300 Acadian refugees.G. Desilets., pp. 14-15. Some returned to St. John only to be imprisoned on Georges Island in Halifax Harbour. In the spring of 1759 twenty-nine of the refugees from the Saint John River area went farther up the St. Lawrence to the area around B√©cancour, Quebec, where they successfully established a community.G. Desilets, p. 15.] After the fall of Quebec on September 18, 1759, the resistance ended. The Maliseet and Acadians of the Saint John River surrendered to the British at Fort FrederickJohn Faragher, p. 412 and Fort Cumberland. On 2 January 1760 most of the Acadian men who had come to Fort Frederck were boarded onto ships. The next day, the women and children were put on board, and the ship sailed for Halifax. Within weeks of their arrival in the provincial capital the captured Acadians were bound for France.Plank, p. 62 In 1761, there were 42 Acadians at St Ann and 10‚Äì12 at Grimross. In 1762, Lieutenant Gilfred Studholme, who commanded the garrison at Saint John, was unsuccessful in removing the remaining Acadians from the Saint John River in preparation for the arrival of the New England Planters.Campbell, p. 31 With the migration of returning Acadians after the close of the Seven Years' War in the 1760s to the river valley and other areas of what is now New Brunswick, the region became the center of Acadian life in the maritime region.

He was incarcerated at the Camp Crame in Quezon City from 2006 to 2010 for rebellion charges and attempted coup d'√©tat. After more than 4 years in prison, Lim was granted temporary freedom by the Armed Forces of the Philippines on May 31, 2010. On November 29, 2007, the same group triggered a standoff at the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati, where he called for Arroyo's ouster. On September 20, 2009, Lim announced his plan to join the 2010 senatorial race, as an independent candidate where he was invited to join 3 senatorial slates, namely the Liberal Party of then Senator Benigno Aquino III, Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino of former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada and former Senator Jamby Madrigal. He assumed the post of Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs under Aquino's administration, but resigned in July 2013 due to corruption in the bureau. Lim joined the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte on May 22, 2017 as MMDA chief replacing acting chairman and general manager Thomas Orbos. Biography =Early life= Lim was born on June 2, 1955 in Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, the youngest of five brothers. He is of Chinese descent whose roots can be traced back to Xiamen, China, formerly Amoy. His mother is from Bohol. He finished elementary and high school in Solano with flying colors. He was in his first year at the University of the Philippines when he took the entrance exams to the Philippine Military Academy. He topped the exams. Lim is a member of the Pagkakaisa Masonic Lodge No. 282, which is under the jurisdiction of The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the Philippines. =Philippine Military Academy= Lim is a member of the Philippine Military Academy Makatarungan Class 1978. He is the mistah of adopted member, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, former President of the Philippines and the former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, General Delfin N. Bangit, AFP. While a plebe, he took the entrance exam to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, one of the world's premier military academies, because of his outstanding performance as cadet. He topped the exams. =Early career= After graduation, he returned to the country and took the Scout Ranger Course where he graduated No. 1 and led his team in registering the only encounter of the class during their test mission. He opted to be assigned to Jolo after that. He commanded the forward Recon Unit of the 1st Infantry Division in Sulu where he was wounded twice in combat. =Involvement with the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM)= Capt. Lim was recruited into the rightist Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) during the 1980s and was involved in the People Power Revolution, but came into public knowledge during the botched 1989 Coup d'√âtat against the Cory Aquino government. It was then-Capt. Lim along with Capt. Abraham Puruganan who led the 1st Scout Ranger Regiment into what has been known as the \\"Siege of Makati.\\" =Manila Peninsula Incident= Lim as part of the Philippine Army. On the morning of November 29, 2007, Antonio Trillanes IV, Brigadier General Lim, Capt. Nicanor Faeldon and other Magdalo officials walked out of their trial and marched through the streets of Makati, calling for the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. They then had a meeting on the second floor of The Peninsula Manila Hotel along Ayala Avenue. Former vice-president Teofisto Guingona joined the march to the Manila Peninsula Hotel, as well as some soldiers from the AFP. 3 P.M. Deadline Thirty soldiers who stood on trial for the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny walked out of court and set up a meeting at The Peninsula Manila Hotel, where they called for the ouster of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. They had been joined by former vice- president Teofisto Guingona, who called the gathering a \\"New Edsa\\". Arroyo called for an emergency Cabinet meeting as she took a chopper back to the Palace amid tight security. Novaliches Catholic Bishop Antonio Tobias, Infanta Bishop Emeritus Julio Labayen, and Fr. Robert Reyes joined the Antonio Trillanes IV group, while Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita and Ignacio Bunye rushed back to Malaca√±ang. The Presidential Security Group sealed off the Palace, while troops secured the North and South Luzon Expressways. A website forthwith appeared, proclaiming General Lim and Senator Antonio Trillanes IV as the leaders of the incident. Afp.google.com, Philippine rebels met-up in hotel, demand Arroyo step down: witnesses The website entry read: \\"Senator Antonio Trillanes, Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, Magdalo soldiers, their guards and the people have started marching towards Makati triangle. We presently find in existence a dangerous concept where the armed forces now owe their primary allegiance and loyalty to those who temporarily exercise the authority of the executive branch of the government rather than to the country and the Constitution they have sworn to protect. That is a concept we defy and struggle to eradicate. If you believe you are a man of will and courage with unselfish motives and brave enough to fight against such tyranny, rise up and be counted!\\" The Philippine National Police (PNP) gave Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV and Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim until 3 p.m. to surrender, as it evacuated guests and personnel inside the Manila Peninsula Hotel. Gma.news.tv, PNP imposes 3 p.m. deadline for Trillanes, Lim to surrender The PNP general also ordered later the evacuation of the press in the hotel. Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim, stated, \\"We make this fateful step of removing Mrs. Macapagal-Arroyo from the presidency and undertake the formation of a new government.\\"Uk.reuters.com, Soldiers take over Manila hotel and call for Arroyo to go Security forces were scheduled the Manila Peninsula in Makati at exactly 3 p.m. to arrest rebel soldiers. Judge Oscar Pimentel, Makati Regional Trial Court, issued the arrest order, and Director Geary Barias, National Capital Region Police Office director, stated: \\"Arrests will be made at 3 p.m.\\"Abs-Cbn News, Military, PNP to storm Makati hotel After 3 p.m., police director Geary Barias of the National Capital Region Police Office left The Peninsula Manila Hotel, since he was asked to leave by troops supportive of Trillanes. A defiant Antonio Trillanes IV dismissed the 3 p.m. deadline of the PNP, saying, \\"Believe me, nothing will happen after three o'clock.\\" (UPDATE 6) Barias leaves ahead of 3 p.m. deadline At least 50 Special Weapons and Tactics commandos lined up outside to assault the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati to enforce the arrest of rebel soldiers. Sporadic warning shots were heard from the police outside the hotel, as smoke was seen coming from the hotel seconds after the shots. At around 4:01 p.m., the Palace asked reporters to move out of the hotel, as armored personnel carriers arrived. Hundreds of guests scrambled to vacate, and Trillanes said they will 'wait and see'. Bishop Julio Labayen appealed: \\"Please do not storm the place, so nobody gets hurt.\\" at around 4:37 p.m. Firing stopped at 4:30 p.m. Abs Cbn, Shots fired as pro-Arroyo troops begin assault at hotelAbs Cbn, Firing stops at The Penhotel GMA crew, and other media personnel were trapped in the hotel, while the Palace appealed to the media and the public to stay away from Makati. Tear gas was fired into the hotel lobby as government troops advanced. Soldiers surrounded the hotel at 5 p.m. Abs Cbn, GMA crew, other media personnel still trapped in Manila Pen A V150 armored car then destroyed the main facade of the Manila Peninsula Hotel to allow the troops to enter. Chief Justice Reynato Puno, who had just arrived from Guam, stated that he would not head a caretaker government if President Arroyo was removed from power, for he wants to insulate the judiciary from politics. Prominent businessmen denounced Trillanes and Lim.

The bail was set for P200,000 each. The bail was supposed to give them temporary liberty while the case is being heard. However, they cannot leave the prison yet; Armed Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said: ‚ÄúThe group of Senator Trillanes cannot be released until after the military has agreed already, because they are still facing general court martial.\\" Brawner also added: ‚ÄúUnder the military law, there is no such thing as bail.\\" After 4 years in detention, on May 31, 2010, Lim was granted temporary freedom by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which approved his request to be placed under the custody of another military officer. AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Delfin Bangit also approved the grant of temporary liberty to Lim. After proper custodial procedures and medical examination were conducted, the retired Brigadier General was released 5:35 p.m. from the Philippine National Police (PNP) Custodial Center in Camp Crame in Quezon City. Lim, however, still faces a charge of violation of Article 67 (mutiny) of the Articles of War in relation to a supposed plan to grab power last February 2006. His co-accused in the 2006 case include former Marine commandant Maj. Gen. Renato Miranda and former Marine Col. Ariel Querubin. He is also charged with violation of Articles of War 63 (disrespect to the President), 96 (conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman), 97 (conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline), and 70 (escape from confinement). These charges are in connection with the November 2007 Manila Peninsula Incident. Political career =Senatorial race in 2010= On September 20, 2009, Lim declared his intention to run for senator in 2010. He filed his certificate of candidacy (COC) for senator on November 27, 2009. When interviewed by some reporters, the Brigadier General said: \\"I would like to bring the people's awareness on corruption to a higher level, so that the issue of corruption will not be limited to one branch of the government.\\" He also added: \\"I have served the military for 36 years and throughout my 36 years of military service, I have been consistent in advocating reforms in the military, but the military career being behind me now, this is now my alternative arena.\\" Under existing laws, all active military and police personnel are forced to resign from the service after filing their respective certificates of candidacy for any elective posts. As a result, Lim had to leave his military position. Lim is not allowed to get out of detention to campaign. He has also been endorsed by Senators Gregorio \\"Gringo\\" Honasan, Antonio Trillanes IV. Senator Jamby Madrigal also threw her support behind Lim. Initially an independent candidate, he later joined the Liberal Party (LP) as a guest candidate. The LP was fielding senators Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III and Manuel 'Mar' Roxas II. At first, General Lim intended to run under the Magdalo Para Sa Pagbabago, but the Commission on Elections denied the group's accreditation to become a political party. On December, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) disqualified Lim from the 2010 Senate race, as the poll body did not think Lim had the capacity to run in a national elections. A few days later, Lim submitted evidence seeking to reverse the Comelec's decision. LP spokesman Representative Lorenzo Ta√±ada III said: \\"The LP believes that the Comelec will reconsider its previous decision and allow Gen. Danny Lim to run for senator under the LP banner.\\" A month later, the Comelec reinstated Lim as an official candidate for Senator, along with Nicanor Perlas, who was running for president. However, Lim was not as lucky as Antonio Trillanes in 2007. Several presidential aspirants courted the Magdalo group prior to the official campaign period; the Magdalo also received financial support from some close people in the Philippine Military Academy, the Guardians (a fraternity of soldiers led by Senator Gregorio Honasan), assorted businessmen, and party-list groups. These efforts were only enough to push Lim to 17th place in the senatorial race with over 6 million votes as of Comelec tallies released on 2 p.m. Tuesday (May 11). On May 11, the former brigadier general conceded defeat, after partial election results by the COMELEC showed him far from the top 12 aspirants.

The notion of functional sourcing has existed in several industries for years but was first introduced into the clinical research industry by clinical research organizations (CROs). Concept The concept of functional sourcing is to utilize a vendor to provide resources to perform the actual clinical research functions required as opposed to outsourcing the entire study. Under this model, the functions are performed by a CRO on sponsor systems by following sponsor processes. The sponsor retains control of the systems, data, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and project related oversight to the extent they desire and agree. The CRO provides the human resources, incurs the costs related to the team's employment, and is responsible for line management of the team. This model benefits both the sponsor and the CRO. Because all the work is conducted by CRO resources on sponsors‚Äô systems following sponsors‚Äô SOPs, the sponsor benefits by maintaining control of service delivery without the burden of resource management and utilization. There is no risk of a sponsor not having access to the data. By utilizing sponsor systems, the sponsor controls access to the data. The CRO benefits because the CRO has the opportunity to become a strategic partner with the sponsor and can, in turn, participate in the planning and forecasting process for sponsor resource needs. This is attractive to CROs because it is often difficult for CROs to otherwise manage fluctuating resource needs as various projects arise. Being involved at a higher level to understand sponsor needs helps the CRO manage resources. By the same token, this forecasting and planning methodology is something that the sponsor wants to outsource to the CRO.  Sub-models  For all intents and purposes, functional sourcing is really made up of a subset of outsourcing models: * Insourcing and employee transfer and re-engagement * Outsourcing * Low-cost centers * Hybrid solutions = Insourcing, remote insourcing, employee transfer and re-engagement = Under the insourcing model, employees are on-boarded by the CRO, placed at sponsor or remote locations, and directed by the sponsor at their sites. Insourced resources are valuable in meeting research goals during periods of peak demand. This model allows sponsors to extend their current team without increasing their headcount. The task of the CRO is to then resource employees to the sponsor who can blend in with the culture of the sponsor company and provide the services that the sponsor needs in conjunction with the existing team. This prevents the sponsors from needing to bring on a dedicated staff when they do not have the long term need. Remote insourcing is similar to insourcing, except employees are placed at a remote location. Under the employee transfer and re-engagement model, the sponsor transfers some of their existing employees to the CRO. The CRO in turn hires the resources as company employees and then dedicates them back to the sponsor. This allows the sponsor to offload the management of the employees and reduces their headcount but at the same time allows them to have the same individuals performing their services thus maintaining continuity across the project. The sponsor does not have to manage the resources over time but is still able to have the work completed by people they know and trust. = Outsourcing = Outsourcing is where a sponsor turns over a task or service to a CRO. The service is performed on the sponsor's systems from a remote CRO office. This is one of the most common Functional Sourcing models. One reason that functional sourcing is becoming a more widely used outsourcing model is the strides that technology has made in the last two decades regarding remote access. Today there are several ways in which remote access can be achieved. One method is to put in a dedicated hard line that connects the CROs machines to the sponsor's systems. Another way is for the sponsor to provide the CRO with a secure VPN connection that is made by connecting the firewall of the CRO to the firewall of the sponsor. Another commonly used method is where the sponsor treats the CRO like a remote employee by providing them their VPN software or a company issued laptop. The benefits of all these methods for the sponsor are that all activities (including security) are driven by the sponsor. This allows the sponsor to grant and revoke access as they see fit. = Low cost centers = One might think that functional sourcing is a US-based phenomenon and is not used frequently in other parts of the world due in part to physical distance as well as differences in culture, currency, and language. This, however, is untrue. The concept of low cost centers for Functional Sourcing is significant because it allows CROs to provide resources to sponsors around the clock. The idea is that resources can be located in different global locations but can still follow the same set of sponsor SOPs and can connect to the same sponsor network using the aforementioned techniques. The most considerable benefit to the sponsor is that functions can be resourced to regions of the world where the labor costs are significantly lower than the US. The cost savings to the sponsor in many cases may be as high as 60 percent of US costs. The benefit to the sponsor is obvious but this concept also benefits the CRO as it gives the CRO more versatility and allows the CRO to be more competitive. = Hybrid solution = Hybrid solutions include any situation where many outsourcing models are used in diverse and cross functional ways. Functional sourcing is an example of a hybrid solution. One of the benefits of hybrid solutions is that the models can be adjusted to meet the needs of the client. Multiple models can be used for different projects under the same sponsor. For example, many US based companies that employ a Functionally Sourced outsourcing model are also implementing a low cost center model. As mentioned above, this allows US based CROs to augment their existing staff and maximize their resource availability. The sponsor, in turn, benefits from working with the senior management of onshore local partner while, again, taking advantage of lower costs and increased availability of the global resources. = Consulting and atypical projects = This category is left for projects that do not fit into one of the previous categories. One of the advantages to functional sourcing is that it can be used broadly across the clinical research industry. Functional sourcing can be used for large projects as a way to alleviate resource management for the sponsor. It can also be used for global projects as a way to maximize availability and reduce costs. Additionally, it can be used by small companies who want to retain control of their data but lack the full-time resources. Finally, functional sourcing provides flexibility to the sponsor when they are in need of a flexible solution.  Trends  As mentioned above, the clinical trial industry has seen growth in functional sourcing over the last few years. This growth is tied to the continued adoption of functional sourcing in the industry. Having experienced success and gained significant confidence in the functional sourcing model, sponsors have decided to expand the use of this model to different areas. In April 2009, Pharmaceutical Executive published the following regarding a major Pharmaceuticals company's use of functional sourcing: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ signals a profound shift in outsourcing practices. More and more drug companies‚Äîincluding Merck and Pfizer‚Äîare moving from \\"transactional\\" (capacity- and project-based) outsourcing to \\"functional\\" (competency- and portfolio-based) partnerships.‚ÄùPharmExec.com: \\"Make a Match\\"  References  Category:Supply chain management ","title":"Functional sourcing"},{"id":"27067478","text":"I Don't Want to Go Home was the first album by seminal New Jersey rock/R&B; band Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

She co-founded the Phillips Collection with her husband, Duncan Phillips. Early life and education She was born Marjorie Acker in Bourbon, Indiana. She was the sister to six other siblings. Her parents were Charles Ernest Acker and Alice Beal. She was raised in Ossining, New York. Phillips started drawing as a child. Her uncles were Reynolds Beal and Gifford Beal. Both men noticed Phillips artistic ability and suggested she pursue art as a career path. She began attending the Art Students League in 1915 and graduated in 1918. She studied under Boardman Robinson. Mid-life and career > Marjorie Phillips has the unmistakable style of the born painter. - Duncan > Phillips Phillips is quoted as stating that she \\"didn't want to paint depressing pictures.\\" She painted primarily landscapes and still life works. Despite living a socialite lifestyle alongside her husband, Phillips made the effort to paint every morning in her Washington, D.C. studio. =Fine art, family and the Phillips Collection= She attended an art exhibition for Duncan Phillips at the Century Association in January, 1921. She met Duncan, and the two married in October of that year. Duncan was an art collector, and the couple expanded their collecting. Phillips moved to Washington, D.C. and into Duncan's Dupont Circle mansion. Duncan's mother also lived at the mansion. Phillips gave birth to her first child with Duncan, Mary Marjorie. While visiting France in 1923, Phillips became interested in Impressionism. She found inspiration in the work of Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul C√©zanne. She didn't only find inspiration in their work, but the couple began collecting their work. During that 1923 trip, they purchased Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party for $125,000. In 1924, their second and final child, Laughlin, is born. In 1930, the couple had collected so much artwork that they had to leave the mansion, with the art, and move into a nearby house in the Foxhall neighborhood. The house was named \\"Dunmarlin\\". The couple had a summer home in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. It was called Ormsby Lodge and Carriage House. Duncan died in 1966. In total, the couple had collected over 2,500 works of art, many which were on display at the museum. After his death, Phillips, who served as Associate Director of the Phillips Collection, became Director. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Later life and legacy In 1971 she curated a retrospective about Paul C√©zanne and published the book, Duncan Phillips and His Collection. Phillips retired in 1972. Her son, Laughlin Phillips, became Director of the Phillips Collection. Phillips donated a piece of property, in Martha's Vineyard, to the Sheriff's Meadow Foundation in 1980. The property, which today is a nature conservancy, was named Phillips Preserve. She died in 1985 of pulmonary failure. The Phillips family papers are held in the collection of the Heinz History Center. The Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library has a holding of archival materials of Phillips'.

It was extremely common in major Japanese companies beginning with the first economic successes in the 1920s through the Japanese post-war economic miracle until after the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble, the Lost Decade and the following economic reforms. History Sh≈´shin koy≈ç starts with an event called simultaneous recruiting of new graduates in which a large cohort of recent university graduates all enter a company at once. It gave Japanese workers the important feeling of job security as part of Japanese management culture, and in turn, elicited a high degree of company loyalty. A high demand for the few available engineers forced companies to bind these employees to the company. The collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble and the following crisis in the 1990s did not weaken the practice. It was still even used in Japanese small businesses. Some critics of lifetime emploment hoped that with Junichiro Koizumi's administration, lifetime employment would become less common. They hoped that neoliberal economics policies would result in privatization, firing of old and expensive workers, and the rise of part-time jobs. Due to the long recession and the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, some companies discontinued the practice of sh≈´shin koy≈ç and implement mass layoffs. Thus, there was less job security as sh≈´shin koy≈ç was challenged. However, as noted by Takahashi (2018): \\"in the case of regular workers, the practice of long-term employment is maintained, in the sense that both employers and labor unions still seek to avoid making dismissals or voluntary retirement solicitations.\\" References External links *The State and Change in the \\"Lifetime Employment\\" in Japan: From the End of War Through 1995 * Japan: Rethinking Lifetime Employment *Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòemployment for life‚Äô myth *New York Times In Japan, Secure Jobs Have a Cost *New York Times Japan Strives to Balance Growth and Job Stability *Is the Japanese employment system degenerating?

It is located in Fairmount Park, just upstream from the Girard Avenue Bridge. It is also known as Pennsylvania Railroad, New York Division, Bridge No. 69. Other names include Connecting Railway Bridge, Connection Bridge, New York Connecting Bridge, New York Railroad Bridge, and Junction Railroad Bridge. Initial bridge The bridge was built in 1866 and 1867 by the Connecting Railway, a company affiliated with the Pennsylvania Railroad and formally purchased by the PRR in 1871. Its purpose was to connect the PRR's southern and northern lines, and to be part of an eventual direct PRR line from Washington, D.C., to New York City. Before the bridge's construction, PRR trains took a circuitous route between PRR's West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia Stations. The bridge was probably designed by John A. Wilson, chief engineer of the Connecting Railway Company, who surveyed the route in 1863. Following Wilson's 1864 resignation, PRR First Vice-President George Brooke Roberts, an engineer, took over the project and saw it through to completion. (He later became president of the PRR.) Thomas Seabrook was the masonry contractor. The bridge opened to traffic on 2 June 1867. The bridge was narrow, with only 2 tracks and an iron truss at mid-river. This was a cast- and wrought-iron, arch- reinforced, double-intersection Whipple truss. In 1873, PRR slightly reduced the truss's span by widening the stone piers at each end. Probably at the same time, PRR removed the truss's reinforcing arch. In 1897, PRR replaced the Whipple truss with a Pratt truss of the same length. Expanded bridge Between 1912 and 1915, PRR more than doubled the width of the bridge to 5 tracks, and replaced the mid-river iron truss with two massive stone arches. Alexander C. Shand was the designer of what was essentially a new bridge, built to look like the original. Eyre, Shoemaker, Inc. was the masonry contractor. Reiter, Curtis & Hill built the reinforced concrete bridges over Lansdowne Drive and West Girard Avenue, and the viaduct curving around the Philadelphia Zoo.Spivey, pp. 6-7. In art The Connecting Railway Bridge, with its line of stone arches, was a frequent subject for painters. It appears in works by Carl Philipp Weber,Beth Kephart, Flow: The Life and Times of Philadelphia's Schuylkill River (2007), p. 101.

(17 November 1862, Middleton Tyas, Yorkshire ‚Äì 7 March 1940 in London) was the Secretary and Librarian of the London Library from 1893 until his death. He managed expansion of the library and compiled a comprehensive catalogue of its collection. The Times called him \\"the guiding genius\\" of the library, the driving force behind the four decades of its growth.Sir Charles Hagberg Wright (obituary). The Times, 7 March 1940. The Library itself hails Wright as \\"the real architect of the London Library as it is today\\".A brief history of the library . London Library. Retrieved 2010-04-22. Wright was a highly public person and frequently engaged in political debates. His scholarly interests ranged from the history of the colonization of Africa to translation of Leo Tolstoy. He had a reputation of a liberal russophile and was involved in Russian radical politics and wartime humanitarian aid to Russian soldiers and academics. Biography =Family roots and early years= Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright was born in Yorkshire into a family of mixed Anglo-Irish and Swedish descent. He was the third son of reverend Charles Henry Hamilton Wright. His father was ordained deacon in 1859; later in life he officiated in Belfast, Dublin and Liverpool and managed the Protestant Reformation Society.Dr. C. H. H. Wright (obituary). The Times, 22 March 1909. His mother was the daughter of Nils Wilhelm Almroth, Governor of the Swedish Royal Mint in Stockholm. His brother Almroth Wright became a prominent bacteriologist and anti-feminist. Wright was privately educated in Russia, France and Germany, and attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and the Trinity College in Dublin. In January 1890 he was appointed to the National Library of IrelandAppointments of January 13, 1890. London Gazette, 17 January 1890 (issue 26015), p. 293. and in the following three years catalogued its collection according to the Dewey system. In 1893 he was elected Secretary and Librarian of the London Library. =London Library= The London Library acquired its first own building in 1879. In 1896‚Äì1898 it was completely rebuilt and became one of the first steel frame buildings in London. Its present-day eclectic facade, Main Hall and Reading Room date back to Wright's time; the library as a whole has been substantially expanded in 1920s, 1930s and 1990s. The library stock grew through purchases and private donations to 250,000 volumes in 1913 and to 400,000 volumes in 1928 (the 500,000 mark was passed in 1950). When notable book collections were slated to be auctioned to foreign buyers, as was the case of Sir Henry Clinton's library, Hagberg publicly rallied to keep them in the country.London Librarian Urges Purchase of Valuable Documents on the Revolutionary War. The New York Times, 27 May 1925. Wright's purchases concentrated in the fields of literature and social sciences, particularly the works of British learned societies. Books on general sciences and natural history were (and still remain) scarce, books on medicine and technology nonexistent. In 1920 the library purchased the Allan collection of books on Biblical studies and Reformation, including some incunabula.These were sold in 1966 to raise money: Stam, p. 417. In the late 1920s Wright disposed of what was then perceived as \\"minor 19th-century fiction\\".Stam, p. 417. T. S. Eliot, who was elected President of the library twelve years after Wright's death, said: \\"I do not believe that there is another library of this size which contains so many books which I might want, and so few of the books which I cannot imagine anyone wanting.\\"As cited in Kent, Larcour and Daily, p. 267 (italics as in the source). The source attributes the quote to Elliot's 1952 address delivered to the members of the library. Before Wright, the library's catalogue evolved through annual addenda to its 1842 founding catalogue. The practice was unsatisfactory, and Wright concentrated on producing a proper modern catalogue. The first edition, compiled by Wright and Christopher Purnell, was printed in 1903; the second in 1913‚Äì14. It contained 1626 pages; supplementary volumes were printed in 1920 and 1929. The catalogue was arranged in six volumes for the general public and in 38 folio volumes for daily internal use. In addition, Wright published a companion Subject Index (1909, 1923, 1938). His catalogues earned reputation for scrupulous research and attribution of anonymous and pseudonymous publications, and became a standard reference source for British and overseas librarians. His catalogue system forms the foundation of present-day electronic database. Wright was knighted on 1 January 1934.Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. London Gazette, 1 January 1934 (supplement to issue 34010 29 December 1933), p. 2. His greatest desire was to guide the London Library through its centennial in 1941. =Public activities= In 1901 Wright was the founding member of the African SocietyFifty Years of a British African Society. African Affairs, Vol. 50, No. 200, Jubilee (July 1951), pp. 177-195. and contributed an article on the German colonization of Africa to the first issue of the Journal of the African Society.Hagberg Wright, C. T. (1901). German Methods of Development in Africa. Journal of the Royal African Society, Vol. 1, No. 1 (October 1901), pp. 23-38. After the outbreak of World War I Hagberg Wright signed the Reply to German Professors by British Scholars asserting that \\"we must carry on the war on which we have entered. For us, as for Belgium, it is a war of defense waged for liberty and peace.\\"New York Times, Current History, pp. 392 (quote), 398 (Wright's signature). During the war he campaigned for the establishment of libraries for the Russian prisoners in Germany.Ludington, Flora (1954). The American Contribution to Foreign Library Establishment and Rehabilitation. The Library Quarterly, Vol. 24, No. 2 (April 1954), pp. 192-204. Wright had a reputation of a liberal russophile. He translated works by Leo Tolstoy, and wrote that Tolstoy's greatness \\"has been obscured from us rather than enhanced by his duality: a realist who strove to demolish the mysticism of Christianity and became himself a mystic in the contemplation of Nature.\\"Stories that Tolstoy Left. The New York Times, 25 February 1912. In 1908 Wright personally presented Tolstoy a letter signed by more than 700 English admirers. Wright noted Tolstoy's \\"apparent serenity\\" but did not mention his aversion to public events. Tolstoy lamented in his diary: \\"At this advanced age, when there is nothing left to think about but death, they want to bother me with that!\\".Anniversaries: Births. Times Online, 3 September 2003. Later, Wright provided legal support to Tolstoy's secretary Vladimir Chertkov and his family after their emigration to England.Anna Tchertkoff, deceased. London Gazette, 25 December 1931 (issue 33783), p. 8361. Wright welcomed Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Nabokov, Alexey Tolstoy to London and introduced them to English writers and publishers of his circle. He was an important figure of the Anglo-Russian Committee, an organization that regularly exposed Russian political troubles to the British public.Beloff, pp. 135-136 (footnotes). Before World War I he actively engaged in radical Russian politics. In 1908 Wright, Henry Nevinson, and Peter Kropotkin campaigned to raise money for the escape of Russian revolutionary Maria Spiridonova, who was serving life sentence for a murder. Spiridonova declined the offer and stayed in Siberia.John, p. 75. During the Russian Civil War Wright joined the British Committee for Aiding Men of Letters and Science in Russia.Letters to the Editor: The British Committee for Aiding Men of Letters and Science in Russia.

He was also noted for being the first to announce that Charlotte had its first NBA team, and he once had to break into regular programming to announce a regular news bulletin. In 2000, Sports Illustrated referred to Johnson as \\"the dean of Charlotte sportscasters\\" who had become \\"an expert in broadcasting sports sorrow\\"; the magazine listed the many tragedies he was known for reporting, including the deaths of Kenny Irwin, Fred Lane, Adam Petty and Bobby Phills. Other events included the murder trial of Rae Carruth, the sexual assault trial of George Shinn, and other legal troubles facing the area's major sports figures. Johnson retired from WSOC in 2006 to spend more time with his family. In 2009, The Charlotte Observer named Johnson as number one on the newspaper's list of top sportscasters in Charlotte. Langston Wertz Jr. said \\"His 'big guy' persona was ESPN before there was ESPN.\\" 2010 U.S. Congressional campaign On December 4, 2009 at age 68, Johnson announced he would run against Democrat incumbent Larry Kissell in . His reasons for running included high unemployment and numerous closed factories, as well as the overall state of the country. He said, \\"I speak from the heart. ... this isn't the America I know.\\" He said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led Democrats \\"off a cliff\\". Johnson also criticized \\"big government spending\\" and \\"absence of leadership\\". To create jobs, he hoped to lower taxes and offer incentives. He officially filed as a candidate on February 23, 2010. Though he had less money to spend than some of his five Republican competitors, and he was new to the district, Johnson hoped to take advantage of his familiarity to TV viewers in the western part of the district, which stretches from Concord to Fayetteville. Johnson describes himself as a \\"Reagan Republican\\". In 1986, he was asked to host a rally at Charlotte's airport during a visit by President Ronald Reagan. He also has a \\"deep-rooted\\" Christian faith. On May 4, 2010, Johnson received 33 percent of the vote compared to 37 percent for Tim D'Annunzio; he then defeated D'Annunzio by 22 points in a bitterly contested runoff on June 22, 2010. State Board of Elections - 2nd primary election results Late polling showed Johnson within a point of Kissell, and several experts called the race a tossup. Ultimately, Kissell was reelected fairly convincingly, taking 53 percent of the vote to Johnson's 44 percent. Electoral history Later broadcast career Johnson co-hosts a morning show on WSIC in Statesville. Personal life Johnson lived in Statesville with his wife Linda, and they had three children. In January 2010, Johnson left Statesville after living there more than 50 years to move into a Concord condo. He was married for 44 years before losing his wife to cancer, and now has nine grandchildren.

Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Luna, 3rd Duke of the Infantado, nicknamed El Grande, (Arenas de San Pedro, Spain, 11 March 1461 - Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, Spain, 30 August 1531) was a Spanish noble. He was born in one of the richest and most influential families of Castile. He was the son of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Luna, 2nd Duke of the Infantado (* Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, 1438 - Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, 1500) and the grandson of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Duke of the Infantado, (* Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, 1415 - Manzanares el Real, 1479). He became 3rd duke in 1500. He married, first, circa 1491, Maria Pimentel y Pacheco (deceased 1499), daughter of Rodrigo Afonso Pimentel, 4th count and 1st duke of Benavente. They had 4 children : * √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 4th Duke of the Infantado, (1493‚Äì1566). * Rodrigo de Mendoza, 1st marquis of Montes-Claros. * Ana, married Luis de la Cerda, 1st marquis of Cogolludo. * Marina, married Diego Arias. He remarried in 1530 with Maria Maldonado, no issue. He participated in the conquest of Granada, distinguishing himself in the conquest of Loja. He was a strong political opponent of Cardinal Cisneros and defended the rights of the nobles. In 1519, he became a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece on proposal of King Charles I of Spain, a.k.a. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. During the Revolt of the Comuneros in 1520 and 1521, the duke of Infantado played a cautious waiting game to see which side would win. In 1521 he chose to support King Charles I, mostly because of his hate towards Bishop Acu√±a. King Francis I of France stayed in his palace, after the King had been taken prisoner in the Battle of Pavia in 1525. In his old age, the Duke suffered from gout and led a pious life.

Built in the 18th century on the site of a decaying Quaker meeting house, it served Baptists in the town for many years until a new chapel was constructed nearby. The chapel is a Grade II Listed building. History The medieval Cinque Port of Rye, on a sandstone hill in the middle of flat marshland, has (in common with the rest of Sussex) supported a great variety of Christian denominations over the centuries. The earliest post-Reformation community were the Quakers, who founded a chapel on the south side of Mermaid Street in 1700 or 1704. They used this meeting house for the next half-century; but in 1753 it was reported as being \\"in a very dilapidated condition and past hope of repair\\". They sold the site to a congregation of Strict Baptists who had just formed in the town. They knocked down the decrepit building and erected a new chapel on the site; it was ready in 1754. An adjacent house was taken over and used as a schoolroom for Baptist children. The religious census of Sussex in 1851 recorded that the chapel had 280 sittings, 150 of which were free; and attendances at morning, afternoon and evening services were given as 80, 60 and 140 respectively. Fifty Sunday school children attended in the morning and afternoon as well. By 1900, the chapel had been joined by an array of other places of worship. The Church of the Holy Spirit, an Anglican church at Rye Harbour, was established in 1849; a Roman Catholic church was built in 1900; a second Strict Baptist chapel was founded in 1835; Methodists built their chapel in 1814 and extended it in 1852; and in 1882 a Congregational church was founded. Meanwhile, some members of Rye Particular Baptist Chapel seceded from it in 1813 and founded a new independent Baptist church; they met in a house at first, but built their own chapel in 1817. The parish church, St Mary's, had existed since Norman times. In 1909, a new church was built in nearby Cinque Ports Street. It replaced yet another Baptist chapel of 1844; but the congregation of Rye Particular Baptist Chapel moved to it as well. The 1754 building was closed in 1910 and sold. It became a men's club before being converted into a house, which took the name Quaker's House. Rye Particular Baptist Chapel, under its new name of Quaker's House, was designated a Grade II Listed building on 12 October 1951. Architecture The chapel is a two-storey red-brick building in a Vernacular style. The roof, which has two dormer windows in the attic space above the first floor, is laid with tiles at the rear and slates at the front. The three-bay fa√ßade, wide, has a wide doorway with a straight canopy supported by ornate brackets. A twin staircase with metal railings leads to the door from the pavement. A thin string course of red bricks separates the ground and first floors, which have two and three shallow-arched sash windows respectively. There are two similar windows on the rear wall; originally the pulpit stood between them. A small gable-ended extension at the rear may have been a vestry. The interior has been opened out to form a single tall open- plan space, although the attic space has been retained.

The battle took place on January 1‚Äì2, 1943, in the areas of Gjorm, Vranisht, Dukat, Tragjas and T√´rba√ß in south-western Albania.  Prelude  After the occupation of the Kingdom of Albania by the Kingdom of Italy in 1939, several resistance groups were formed. The most important of these groups were Balli Komb√´tar, a nationalist organization formed by Mit'hat Frash√´ri and Ali K√´lcyra and the Albanian National Liberation Front, which later became a communist group led by Mehmet Shehu and Enver Hoxha. Dukat and Gjorm became two of the centers of Balli Komb√´tar, whose forces in the region were led by Hysni Lepenica, a military commander, and Sk√´nder Mu√ßo, a prominent lawyer from Tragjas. Mehmet Shehu, a commander of the Albanian National Liberation Front, created a partisan unit in the wider region of Mallakast√´r. Beginning in mid-1942, there were frequent minor attacks against the Italian troops located in the area. In November 1942, these attacks intensified. The commander of the heavily armed Italian troops in the area, which initially numbered 2,000, was Colonel Franco Clementi.  Battle  The main battle, which lasted thirty-six hours, took place on January 1‚Äì2, 1943. The Albanian units were supported during the battle by 300 local volunteers. During the battle, the Italian army used tanks as well as field guns and many machine guns. The battle ended with the decisive defeat of the Italians, who were completely routed from the battlefield, which came under Albanian control. A total of 186 Italian soldiers and officers were killed, including the commander of the Italian troops, Colonel Clementi, while hundreds were wounded and 80 were taken prisoner. Two Italian tanks were destroyed, while military equipment captured by the Albanians included three field guns, twenty-nine machine guns, large quantities of ammunition, and hundreds of rifles.  Aftermath  After being defeated and routed from the battlefield, the Italian army engaged in reprisals against the civilians of the five villages of Dukat, Gjorm, Tr√´ba√ß, Tragjas, and Vranisht. The Italian air force bombed the villages. During these attacks, there were many civilian victims including the mayor of Dukat, Shukri Cane. As a consequence of another punitive expedition, Gjorm was also mortared until it was completely ruined. A 1981 painting by Fatmir Haxhiu, entitled Gjorm War (), commemorates the Battle of Gjorm. The painting is on display in the National Historical Museum of Albania.

Listed at , 138 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports by David L. Porter. Publisher: Greenwood Press, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 2064pp. Language: English. Overview profile An All-Star catcher, Paire was a fine defensive player with good range on the field and a strong throwing arm. She exhibited an aggressive catching style, leading to a broken collarbone in her rookie season. She suffered numerous injuries thereafter, but kept on playing. Basically a line-drive hitter, she had a compact swing and tremendous plate discipline, collecting a significant 2.63 walk-to-strikeout ratio (308-to-117). A lifetime .225 hitter she made good contact, hitting safely more frequently with runners on base or when the team was behind in the score, as her 400 runs batted in ties her in fourth place with Elizabeth Mahon on the all-time list, behind Dorothy Schroeder (431), Inez Voyce (422) and Eleanor Callow (407). In addition, the versatile Paire played shortstop and third base, and even pitched. She also was a member of a championship team and made the playoffs in nine of her ten seasons. In 60 playoff games, she hit .211 with one home run and 16 RBI, including one triple and seven stolen bases. Early life Lavone A. Paire was the daughter of Charles Edward Pair from Montana and Hortense Theresa (n√©e LaPage) Paire Blazek from South Dakota. A native of Los Angeles, California, Paire grew up playing baseball with her older brother, Joseph L. \\"Joe\\" Paire, and started playing baseball at age nine for a grocery store of Santa Monica, in a time that each victory earned the players free groceries during the Depression Era. She attended the University Senior High School, located in West Los Angeles, and continued excelling in sports, playing on semi-professional softball teams along with Faye Dancer, with whom she was recruited by Bill Allington for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. AAGPBL career Paire entered the league in 1944 with the Minneapolis Millerettes. She hit .240 in 60 games as a rookie catcher and was moved to the Fort Wayne Daisies in 1945. That season she slipped to .196 as a shortstop, but paced the Daisies with 39 RBI and led the league with the fewest strikeouts (six). Then she found herself on the move again, this time to the Racine Belles from 1946 through 1947 and then the Grand Rapids Chicks from 1948 to the 1952 midseason, when she returned to the Daisies until her final season in 1953. She also moved around the field over the years, repeating at shortstop (1946), catching again (1947), and switching to third base (1948), before establishing herself as a catcher for the rest of her career. In 1946 Paire hit a solid .238 with 59 RBI in 101 games for the league champion Belles, in a year characterized by strong pitching and low batting averages. Batting crown winner Dorothy Kamenshek led hitters with a .316 mark while pitchers Connie Wisniewski and Joanne Winter tied for a league-lead 33 wins. Paire was one of two hundred players to attend the first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States, which was held in 1947 in Cuba at the Gran Stadium de La Habana.

After that, she hit a career-high .264 with 56 RBI in 1951, and shared catching duties with Rita Briggs in her last two seasons for the Daisies. Life after baseball Subsequently, Paire played amateur softball and bowling. She worked for the Howard Hughes Aircraft Company, married Bob Davis, and had three children, William, Robert, and Susan. She also opened an electronics business with her fellow player and longtime friend Faye Dancer. Paire retired in 1963 to Van Nuys, California, and served as the spokesperson for the Women‚Äôs National Adult Baseball Association, for female players between the ages of 18 and 65.

The highest elevation of this granite massif is the summit of the Gro√üe K√∂sseine, . The border between the Bavarian provinces of Upper Franconia and Upper Palatinate runs over the K√∂sseine as does the European watershed between the North Sea and the Black Sea. Around the K√∂sseine are the settlements of Wunsiedel, Marktredwitz, Bad Alexandersbad, Waldershof, Hohenhard, Neusorg, Brand, Ebnath, Nagel and Tr√∂stau, tourist resorts within the Fichtelgebirge. On the K√∂sseine rises an eponymous stream (officially called the K√∂ssein), which flows through Waldershof and Marktredwitz before discharging into the R√∂sla, a tributary of the Eger, near Seu√üen. The K√∂sseine seen from Hildenbach  Conservation and natural monuments  In the vicinity of the Gro√üe K√∂sseine peak is a large granite blockfield with an area of which has been placed under protection. Various rock formations (the Kleine K√∂sseine, the Gro√üer and Kleiner Haberstein, the Burgsteinfelsen, M√ºhlstein, P√ºttnersfel and Jakobifels) are protected natural monuments. The view of the twin peaks of Kleine and Gro√üe K√∂sseine (Little and Great K√∂sseine), visible from almost all sides, is quite striking. File:Ausblick vom Gipfel der K√∂sseine.jpgView from the summit of K√∂sseine into the High Fichtel mountains  History and famous visitors  The K√∂sseine was first mentioned in the records on 7 March 1283, when large parts of the K√∂sseine (Choezsin) were transferred to Duke Louis the Strict, Count Palatine of Rhine and Duke of Bavaria. From 1542 (Caspar Bruschius: Des Vichtelbergs gr√ºndtliche Beschreibung) to the present day the mountain appeared in all local geographical and historical books and was famous for its outstanding views. By the 15th century its thick woods were already a favourite hunting ground of the Bayreuth margraves, and the forests supplied wood for construction and fuel to the surrounding villages. Granite quarrying began in the same century. In 1785 and 1820 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe came to the Fichtelgebirge. He wrote scientific treatises about granite weathering and made sketches of the various rock formations in the K√∂sseine area. Because of its clear, far-reaching views in all directions of the compass (to the Bavarian Forest, Rh√∂n, Thuringian Forest and Ore Mountains) the mountain has long been a popular destination. Its fame rose considerably as a result of the visit of the nobility from 13 June 1805 to 5 July 1805 and who stayed in (Bad) Alexandersbad. On 17 June 1805 Frederick William III of Prussia and his wife Louise as well as a large entourage rode out to the K√∂sseine. Many newspapers reported the event and spread the mountain's renown.  Structures on the summit  In 1805 the first primitive shelter was erected and, in 1833, another one. In 1882 the Fichtelgebirge Section of the German- Austrian Alpine Club (forerunner of the Fichtelgebirge Club) built a timber refuge hut with food for hikers. Due to the constantly rising number of visitors a permanent house was called for which was finally opened in 1903 after a long preparations and which was considerable extended in the years that followed. In 1924 a stone observation tower, the K√∂sseine Tower (K√∂sseineturm), was built to replace the wooden towers. Both house and tower belong to the Fichtelgebirge Club. The house, built of K√∂sseine Granite and leased, offers accommodation and food all year round. From 1998 to 2000 the K√∂sseinehaus was fully renovated, so that it now has all the modern facilities of an inn. The forest road to the house is out-of-bounds to private vehicles, so it can only be reached on foot. The K√∂sseinehaus is on the network of main hiking trails maintained by the Fichtelgebirge Club; it lies directly next to the High Way and is well used by walkers. The volunteer workers of the Fichtelgebirge Club have laid out 13 marked hiking trails of varying lengths from all directions to the summit of the K√∂sseine. The surrounding villages include the K√∂sseine as a local attraction in their advertising brochures.  Culture and K√∂sseine Granite  The mountain hut on the K√∂sseine has been a venue for folk musicians for a long time who, at regular intervals, play authentic folk music. Folk evenings, too, enjoy great popularity. Near the K√∂sseinehaus there is a large, wooden cross and a stone altar; mountaintop services on Ascension Day and other special occasions are a tradition here. K√∂sseine Granite, which is a blue granite that is unique in Europe, is also called Kleinwendern Granite or Schurbach Granite and occurs near Schurbach and Kleinwendern. It also occurs in a narrow band at the Luisenburg Rock Labyrinth north of the K√∂sseine that runs eastwards. Only the eastern part of the lower rock labyrinth consists of K√∂sseine Granite, the western part is made of Dach Granite. K√∂sseine Granite is quarried today only near Waldershof in the district of Tirschenreuth.

He won a bronze medal in the team foil event at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He rose to the rank of Brigadier General in 1940 and assumed command of 9th Infantry Division, before he was killed during aircraft accident two weeks later. Biography Francis W. Honeycutt was born on May 26, 1883 in San Francisco, California as the son of John Thomas Honeycutt and Jennie Webster. His father was a West Point graduate and Captain in the United States Army, who died of typhoid fever as Commander of Fort Clinch, Florida in October 1898. Following the high school, Francis received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and was active in fencing team. He was a classmate and friend of Joseph Stilwell, the future American commanding general in the China-Burma-India theater of World War II. Also many of his classmates became general officer later in their careers including Lesley J. McNair, Robert C. Richardson, Jr., Jay Leland Benedict, Innis P. Swift, Henry Conger Pratt, Charles F. Thompson, Fulton Q. Gardner, George R. Allin, William Bryden, Walter R. Fulton, George V. Strong, Pelham D. Glassford, Irving J. Phillipson, Donald C. Cubbison and Thomas M. Robins.

He served in the various field artillery assignments and commanded 338th Field Artillery Regiment as the part of 88th Division during the World War I, where he trained the replacements at Camp Dodge, Iowa until June 1918. Following the war, he rose through the ranks and commanded 1st Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Regiment in Oklahoma City from July 1927 to August 1928 and later served on the faculty of the Army War College. In August 1935, Honeycutt was ordered to Fort Sam Houston, Texas and commanded 15th Field Artillery Regiment until March 1937, when he was ordered to the Philippines for service as Commanding officer, 12th Field Artillery Brigade at Fort Stotsenburg.

It is located west of Oyam town and south of Gulu town, about 20 kilometres from Oyam district headquarters and 32 kilometres from Gulu district headquarters. The name originates from min, meaning \\"mother,\\" and kulu, meaning \\"well, river, or source of water.\\" It is derived from a small tributary of the Nile which local tales say had devastating effects on people's lives and property, due to huge floods during rainy seasons destroying crops, and killing people and animals. The havoc that this tributary caused to the people of the area made them perceive it as the mother of all rivers, and gave their locality the name Minakulu, or \\"mother of all rivers.\\" History During colonist times, Minakulu was on its way to becoming a business centre as several businesses were established by Indian men doing retail trade. However, the colonial government in the 1930s passed an ordinance barring foreigners from carrying out retail trade in fear of complete alienation of the indigenous population and thereby causing a possible uprising. Being far from the colonial administrative centre, the Indians continued the trade only to \\"run away\\" following the famous Amin's dream and decree sending away Indians for \\"milking the cow without feeding.\\" People Minakulu is a Lango-inhabited sub-county. However, its location at the border of the Acholi districts of Gulu and Amuru means several acholis are resident in the sub-county. This has never caused any rift, as the relationship between the two sub-ethnic groups has historically been smooth, with both tribes claiming to have originated from Bar-el-Gazel in southern Sudan as the \\"Luo.\\" Historians doubt this assertion though. It is thought that the Langi belong to the Ateker group of other tribes, like the Kumam, Iteso and Karamajong people who may have migrated from Ethiopia. During the LRA insurgency in northern Uganda, Minakulu suffered from several raids by the rebels who looked at the sub-county as its food basket. G-nuts, beans, simsim and peas, which are produced in abundance by the people of the sub-county, were the main targets of the rebels from the 1980s until the Northern Peace talks halted the war in 2007. Education Minakulu hosts several educational institutions including Minakulu Technical School, Dr. Oryang secondary school, Equatorial College - Minakulu, Amwa comprehensive secondary school, 15 primary schools, and a couple of nursery schools. The people of the sub-county are fairly educated compared to the rest of the sub-counties in the district. Economy Minakulu is mainly an agricultural based sub-county. It produces cotton, g-nuts, simsim, cassava, beans, pigeon peas, oranges, mangoes and pineapples. These crops were stored and traded using a government-aided subsidiary, the Lango Cooperative Union, created by the Obote government in the 1960s. However, the world bank liberalisation policy implemented in the 1990s by the new regime of president Yoweri Museveni led to the collapse of this organised commerce. Since then, the people of Minakulu are less commercial in the traditional sense. Rather, there is total concentration on food crops which are mainly for home use with negligible surplus sold to local businessmen for onward transportation and sale to Kampala, Uganda's capital city, where some basic profit is made.

Its website also helps members of the public to find a local metal recycling organisation. It is based in Cambridgeshire, England. Function The UK‚Äôs ¬£5 billion metals recycling industry supplies environmentally sound raw materials to metals manufacturers around the world. The wider industry comprises an estimated 2,500 businesses, employing 8,000-10,000 people, and processes approximately 13 million tonnes of ferrous and non-ferrous metals every year. The BMRA‚Äôs members trade and process steel, aluminium, copper and most other ferrous and non-ferrous metals. At the same time, many recycle a wide range of related products, such as end of life vehicles, packaging, batteries, domestic appliances, building materials and electronic goods. The BMRA also represents those providing valuable services to this industry from transportation to computer software. Membership is open to UK metals recycling companies of good standing that have been in business for at least two years. All members are expected to abide by the BMRA‚Äôs Code of Conduct.  Mission  The BMRA‚Äôs overarching mission is to promote the metals recycling industry while safeguarding the interests of its member companies. This mission is underpinned by five key objectives: * To be an effective voice for the metals recycling industry in the UK. * To promote the sector to policymakers, customers, suppliers and others. * To steer European and UK legislation. * To help members to understand and respond to changing market conditions, legislation and regulations. * To provide additional services of mutual benefit to its members. Ongoing activities Under the 2013 Scrap Metal Dealers Act (England and Wales), any individual or company that trades in scrap metal or end of life vehicles must have either a collector‚Äôs or a site licence from the local authority and must verify the identity of anyone looking to sell scrap metal to them. In addition, the Act means it is now illegal for them to buy scrap metal for cash in England and Wales. Other matters currently being addressed by the BMRA include: * Issues pertaining to Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) in relation to shredders * The Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Bill with regard to licensing dealers and banning cash transactions in Scotland * Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) Regulations concerning the collection, re-use, recycling and recovery of such items.  History  The BMRA was formed in 2001 when the British Secondary Metals Association and the British Metals Federation (previously known as the British Scrap Federation) merged in order to better serve the rapidly changing industry. The role of the trade association became more significant following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 when, in 1935, the government advised that the UK steel industry needed protection from European cartels. During World War 2 such was the demand placed on scrap supply that merchants were put on the reserved occupation list exempting them from conscription. Then, when the British Iron and Steel Corporation sent buyers to the USA to purchase large quantities of scrap subsequent imports saw stocks rise to ‚Äòalarming levels‚Äô and forced dealers to accept lower prices. After the war, members of the National Federation of Scrap Iron and Steel Merchants recovered uneconomic dumps of scrap. The austerity years preserved the status of scrap recovery as a matter of national priority and a ‚Äòscrap drive‚Äô campaign was launched to persuade the public to salvage every pound of reclaimable metal. In the late 1960s, the scrap revolution began with the industry moving from being labour-intensive to capital-intensive, mechanising the recovery process. While legislation was passed in 1988 requiring scrap metal recovery to be licensed as a ‚Äòwaste disposal‚Äô activity, ten years later the first case was brought on whether certain grades of scrap metal should considered as waste.

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Old Dominion Monarchs baseball team. The Monarchs are members of Conference USA. The ballpark has seating for 2,500 spectators in three sections of raised aluminum bleachers. The stadium complex also includes locker rooms, a concession stand, offices, four batting cages, a picnic area and a fully enclosed press box. The facility replaced the university's football stadium, Foreman Field, as the home of the baseball team. The ballpark is named after former Old Dominion head basketball coach, baseball manager, and athletic director Bud Metheny, who worked for the university from 1948 to 1980 after an eleven-year stint in the New York Yankees organization including a World Series championship in 1943. He compiled a record of 423 wins, 363 losses and 6 ties as manager of the Monarchs. Metheny's jersey number, 3, has been retired by the university and is displayed on the right field wall of the stadium. The stadium opened for the 1983 baseball season, with the first game being a 7‚Äì2 Old Dominion win over Millersville University. The complex was not dedicated until April 25, 1984 with a game against the Virginia Tech Hokies. That night's crowd of 2,125 is the highest attendance in stadium history. The ballpark hosted the Sun Belt Conference Baseball Tournament in 1983, 1985, and 1987, and the Colonial Athletic Association Baseball Tournament in 1994. Old Dominion defended home field and won the 1985 Sun Belt and 1994 Colonial championships. The stadium has also hosted multiple Virginia district and state high school baseball tournaments. The Monarchs tied the NCAA record for double plays completed in a single game on May 14, 1985, with 7 during a home game against the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. There have been eight no-hitters pitched at the stadium, all completed by Monarch pitchers. As of the completion of the 2012 season, Old Dominion has a record of 600 wins and 280 losses at the Bud, for a winning percentage of .682. The stadium received a new video-LED scoreboard for the 2009 season as part of a partnership between Old Dominion and CBS Collegiate Sports Properties. The facility underwent an additional three million-dollar renovation for the 2011 season that erected a batters' backdrop in center field, locker room refurbishments and a beer garden. Renovations continued before the 2012 season included brick walls added down the foul lines, a clock above the scoreboard, and a custom outfield wall with images of former Monarchs who have played in the major leagues.

Biography Clemens was the scion of a Virginia family that owned both land and slaves in that state. The Clemens were a Cornish American family originally from Looe in Cornwall, Great Britain.Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005 He was born in Campbell County, Virginia, the eldest of five children, to Samuel B. and Pamela Goggin Clemens. He was named after U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall. His father died in 1805, whereupon the family moved to Kentucky. Pamela Clemens remarried in 1809, and John Clemens started working at age 11, as a clerk at an iron mine. He undertook the study of law in a local law office and became a licensed lawyer at the age of 21. At that same age, he became legally responsible for financial obligations deemed to be owed to his Kentucky stepfather for the costs of supporting the Clemens children and keeping family slaves. The burden of this debt left him without financial resources. He married Jane Lampton on May 6, 1823, in Columbia, Adair County, Kentucky.\\"Kentucky, County Marriages, 1797-1954,\\" database with images, FamilySearch.org She was a religiously conservative Presbyterian, while he was an agnostic freethinker who admired Tom Paine. They moved to Fentress County, Tennessee, where he practiced law, operated a general store, and served as a county commissioner, county clerk, and acting attorney general as a conservative Whig. From 1832 to 1835 he was postmaster in Pall Mall. He speculated unsuccessfully inland and opened four stores which were unsuccessful.Harold K. Bush, Mark Twain and the Spiritual Crisis of His Age (2007) pp. 30‚Äì36. In 1835 the Clemens family, which by then included five children, moved to Missouri, initially to the town of Florida, where his son Samuel, who was to become famous as the author Mark Twain, was born on November 30, 1835. John Clemens practiced law and operated a general store in Florida for several years before moving to Hannibal in 1839. His retail business ventures were not successful, but he was active in civic affairs. He served as a steamboat and railroad commissioner and became a county judge. He served in the Missouri militia but did not serve in the debacle of the Honey War. John Clemens was the father of five sons (including Orion) and two daughters. He died in March 1847 from pleurisy and pneumonia. The widow suspected syphilis was involved and ordered an autopsy which Samuel Clemens probably watched secretly. It deeply affected him.Bush, p. 30 Cabin The cabin in which the Clemens family is believed to have lived in Fentress County, Tennessee, is displayed as part of the collection of the Museum of Appalachia in Norris, Tennessee.Information obtained from museum interpretive sign inside the cabin, 1 May 2009.

History The Hummingbirds were charter members of the North Atlantic League, a Class D circuit which was one of many minor leagues to pop up after the end of World War II. However, the Birds seemed cursed from the start: the club had difficulty finding a home field, finally signing an agreement with Delano-Hitch Stadium (then called Recreation Park) just a week before opening day. Former Yankees third baseman Joe Dugan was offered the manager's job, but he turned Newburgh down; the position went to Frank Novosel instead. The season itself started inauspiciously when only 259 fans attended the home opener on May 10; that Rec Park was not an enclosed facility did not encourage fans to buy tickets. Rain cancelled the next two days' games, then team president Leo Groom died suddenly. More rain deluged the Newburgh area, and the Birds didn't play again until May 17: a 4‚Äì3 win over Mahanoy City which was called after seven innings due to darkness. It would be the last game the Hummingbirds would ever play in Newburgh. On to Walden On May 20, the team's contract at the stadium was cancelled by the city's Recreation Commission, due to nonpayment of rent and the team's failure to install lights at the field. 23-year-old Francis Giegnas, Jr. became the Hummingbirds new president, and he attempted to move his team's games to the Newburgh Free Academy field. But the Board of Education said no, leaving the 'Birds without a home field; on May 23, the franchise became a road team, finally moving to nearby Walden, New York on June 10. The Hummingbirds drew nearly 1,000 fans to their opener in their new home (impressive for a town of just 4,000 people), but it was all downhill from there; Giegnas, unable to pay the team's bills, soon returned the franchise to the NAL. In July, the league sold the club to former minor-league player Lou Haneles for $1,300 (plus assumption of the team's debts). Under Hanales (who became the Hummingbirds' manager and first baseman as well), attendance didn't get any better, drawing just 145 fans to a Booster's Night on July 12. In August, Hanales looked at moving the team to either Reading, Pennsylvania or Newton, New Jersey and/or signing an affiliation deal with the Brooklyn Dodgers; none of these came to pass. Looking for a fresh start, the club dropped the Hummingbirds name and were renamed the Keen Kutters, after a knife factory in Walden; Hanales also dropped admission prices from 80 to 60 cents. Nothing worked: the club would attract only 10,051 fans the entire season, or less than 200 a game. Angry Birds The club, which had a 7-5 mark in Newburgh only to slip to 23-36 by mid-season, completely collapsed after that: they lost 53 of their last 57 games (including their last 19 in a row) to finish the season deep in the NAL cellar at 27-89. The franchise then shifted to Kingston, New York for the 1947 season; ironically, Kingston was able to get the Dodgers affiliation that had eluded Newburgh the previous year, and the team soared to an 81-48 mark, winning the NAL pennant. Unfortunately, attendance was disappointing: only 32,554 fans came to Kingston games in 1947, fourth-best in the loop but still under 500 a game, and not enough to keep the franchise solvent.Kingston Daily Freeman, November 15, 1947, p. 7 Kingston was eliminated in the first round of the league playoffs and never played again, folding over the winter. The league itself disbanded in 1950. The Hummingbirds did feature one future major-league player: Nick Testa. Testa's stay in the bigs was brief‚Äîone inning with no plate appearances with the 1958 San Francisco Giants‚Äîbut his career in Newburgh was even shorter: the 18-year-old Testa is listed as being on the Hummingbirds roster but apparently never played. He would eventually spend 17 years as a player in pro ball (including one in Japan), followed by many years as a coach. Delano-Hitch Stadium would be used for various amateur, collegiate, and American Legion baseball teams over the years (including one in the 1980s named the Hum'n'birds, a take on the old pro team's name), but would not see another professional team for a half-century, when the Newburgh Nighthawks came to town in 1995.

One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 16 *Liberal Democrat 12 *Community Campaign (Hart) 5 *Independent 2 Election result The results saw 2 seats change hands with the Community Campaign (Hart) (CCH) group winning them both. One gain saw the Conservatives lose the seat of Church Crookham East, which Peter Hutcheson had held for the Conservatives for over 20 years, to the CCH. The other gain saw the CCH win Crondall by 2 votes over the Conservatives, gaining the seat which had formerly been held by independent Norman Lambert. Lambert had resigned from the Conservative group in 2005 after admitting making false claims for council tax and housing benefit. The changes meant that the Conservatives remained the largest party on the council with 16 seats but were vulnerable to a coalition among the other groups. Overall turnout in the election was 39.35%. Following the election the Conservative administration of the council, which had run the council for the previous 8 years, was voted out.

The thumbs-down gesture in the painting is given by spectators at the Colosseum, including the Vestals, to the victorious murmillo, while the defeated retiarius raises two fingers to plead for mercy. The painting was an inspiration for the 2000 film Gladiator, where Commodus holds out a raised thumb to spare the film's hero, Maximus. The painting Along with gladiators, Vestals, and spectators, the picture shows the emperor in his box. Like many historical or ethnographic paintings of the era, Pollice Verso piqued the prurient interest and indulged the voyeurism of viewers while allowing them to feel a sense of moral superiority over another (previous, non-Christian) culture.Eckart K√∂hne, Cornelia Ewigleben, Ralph Jackson. Gladiators and Caesars: the Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome, University of California Press, 2000, p. 31. Alexander Turney Stewart purchased the painting from G√©r√¥me at a price of 80,000 francs, setting a new record for the artist,DeCourcy E.

File:Jean- Leon Gerome Pollice Verso (cropped2).jpgDetail: the Vestal virgins signal death for the defeated gladiator. =Historical accuracy= The painting almost immediately kicked off a controversy over the accuracy of Gerome's use of the thumbs-down gesture by spectators in the Colosseum. A 26-page pamphlet published in 1879, \\"Pollice Verso\\": To the Lovers of Truth in Classic Art, This is Most Respectfully Addressed, reprinted evidence for and against the accuracy of the painting, including a letter dated 8 December, 1878 from G√©r√¥me himself.\\"Pollice Verso\\": To the Lovers of Truth in Classic Art, This is Most Respectfully Addressed, pamphlet dated April 10, 1879, Paris. The controversy remains unsettled. The exact gesture described by the phrase pollice verso is not known. From historical, archaeological and literary records from ancient Rome, it remains uncertain whether the thumb was turned up, turned down, held horizontally, or concealed inside the hand to indicate positive or negative opinions.James Grout. The Gladiator and the Thumb. G√©r√¥me's painting greatly popularized the idea that thumbs up signaled life, and thumbs down signaled death, for a defeated gladiator. G√©r√¥me's depiction of the Colosseum's architecture is based on accurate drawings, and the armor of the gladiators follows the design of those found in Pompeii, although the secutor's armor is not properly assembled. His depiction of blood-thirsty Vestal virgins demanding death may have been inspired by a passage by the ancient Christian author Prudentius, who disapproved of the carnage in the arena: > Then on to the gathering in the amphitheatre passes this figure of life- > giving purity and bloodless piety [the Vestal], to see bloody battles and > deaths of human beings and look on with holy eyes at wounds men suffer for > the price of their keep. There she sits conspicuous with the awe-inspiring > trappings of her head-bands and enjoys what the trainers have produced. What > a soft, gentle heart! She rises at the blows, and every time a victor stabs > his victim‚Äôs throat she calls him her pet; the modest virgin with a turn of > her thumb bids him pierce the breast of his fallen foe so that no remnant of > life shall stay lurking deep in his vitals while under a deeper thrust of > the sword the fighter lies in the agony of death.Prudentius. Reply to > Symmachus, Book II, in Prudentius Volume II, translated by H. J. Thomson, > Loeb Classical Library 398, pp. 93-95. =Influence on cinema= This painting and others by G√©r√¥me (including his earlier Ave Caesar! Morituri te Salutant) had a strong influence on the visual portrayal of the ancient world by later filmmakers, beginning with silent movies. The painting was a catalyst for director Ridley Scott; when the producers of Gladiator showed him a reproduction of the painting before he read the script, Scott recalls, \\"That image spoke to me of the Roman Empire in all its glory and wickedness. I knew right then and there I was hooked.\\"Diana Landau, editor. Gladiator: The Making of the Ridley Scott Epic. New York: Newmarket, 2000, p. 26. The sculpture In his fifties, G√©r√¥me took up sculpture. His first work was a large bronze statue of a gladiator holding his foot on his victim, based on Pollice Verso and first shown to the public at the Universal Exhibition of 1878 in Paris.Chisholm, Hugh, ed. \\"G√©r√¥me, Jean L√©on,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University, 1901. After G√©r√¥me's death, in 1909, his son-in-law Aim√© Morot created G√©r√¥me Sculpting \\"The Gladiators\\": Monument to G√©r√¥me, which comprised a new casting of G√©r√¥me's statue along with Morot's portrait sculpture of G√©r√¥me at work.

His character was later adapted for the NBC television show, Little House on the Prairie and given the name \\"Isaiah Edwards.\\" As stated by Wilder in her books, Mr. Edwards was \\"the wildcat from Tennessee\\" whom the Ingalls met during their stay near Independence, Kansas in the Little House on the Prairie novel. They met for a short while also in By the Shores of Silver Lake, when Mr. Edwards helps Pa file his claim during a sudden settlement rush, and in The Long Winter, when he generously gives the now-blind Mary a $20 bill. Historical influences It remains unknown whether Mr. Edwards was a completely fictional person or if his story was based on some authentic events and people from Laura's life. Many researchers of the \\"Little House\\" books believe that Edwards was actually a person or persons whom Laura gave the traits and actions of people she knew who did kind deeds for the Ingalls throughout the years. In her earliest memoir Pioneer Girl, Wilder recalled the name of the neighbor who swam a creek near their house to bring her and sister Mary Christmas presents as \\"Mr. Brown,\\" a deed that she ascribed to Mr. Edwards in Little House on the Prairie. An Alabama native and 35 year-old bachelor named Fred Brown is listed as a resident of Rutland Twp Montgomery Co. KS in the 1870 US Census, the same township where the Ingalls family lived in 1870.https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-64V9-PC7?i=5&cc;=1438024 Possibly this Fred Brown was the model for Mr. Edwards. However, Pamela Smith Hill, the editor of Pioneer Girl suggested that Mr. Edwards may have been the 25-year old English native named Edmund Mason who is also enumerated as a bachelor neighbor of the Ingalls in Rutland Co. Montgomery Co KS (Pioneer Girl p. 16 n. 36). Mason's grave may be found in the local Harrison Cemetery, near where the Ingalls were living in the book Little House on the Prairie, though certain key aspects of Mason's known life are at odds with the information about \\"Mr. Edwards\\" supplied by Laura in her novels. In the media =Little House on the Prairie series= The character of Isaiah Edwards was introduced in the pilot movie, which established the Ingalls family settling on a prairie tract in Kansas. Victor French, a close friend of series creator Michael Landon and a character actor who had acted in several television westerns beforehand, portrayed the role throughout most of the series run. A poorly educated, gruff-looking dirt farmer, Mr. Edwards helps the Ingalls family build their new home on the prairie and deal with the hardships that arise. It is during this time that the series' main protagonist, Laura Ingalls, develops a close relationship with Edwards. Laura's mother, Caroline, distrusts Mr. Edwards at first, finding his mannerisms and rough demeanor uncouth, but in time grows to respect and accept him as one of the family. Edwards and the Ingalls family are separated when they are forced to leave their property by the government. When Little House on the Prairie was picked up as a weekly television series, Victor French was returned to the role. In the time between the pilot movie and his first episode, \\"Mr. Edwards' Homecoming,\\" Mr. Edwards had become a drunken drifter, and eventually arrives in Mankato, Minnesota; there, he gets into a barroom brawl when by chance Charles Ingalls ‚Äì who was making a delivery run from Walnut Grove, where the Ingalls family had settled ‚Äì arrives and (upon hearing the commotion and recognizing Mr. Edwards) comes to his defense. Mr. Edwards is brought to the Ingalls' new home near Walnut Grove, and eventually gets a place of his own. It is about this time he reveals his past: He became an alcoholic after his first wife and young daughter died of smallpox, and renounced his Christian faith as a result. For the most part, Mr. Edwards is able to keep his drinking under control in episodes that aired during the first three seasons. Mr. Edwards frequently sang the song, \\"Old Dan Tucker,\\" and a musical cue sometimes introduced his character. Mr. Edwards eventually meets Grace Snider; the two fall in love and are married. They adopt three children orphaned when their mother dies of an illness: John Jr., Carl and Alicia Sanderson. The family remains a part of the cast until the end of the third season, when Mr. Edwards uses a gold claim to begin a logging empire (the storyline was created after Victor French took the lead role in another series, Carter Country). French reprised his role in a Season 6 episode, \\"The Return of Mr. Edwards\\", where he is seriously injured by a falling tree and becomes suicidal; Charles and Laura arrive to help Mr. Edwards out of his depression. With French's return to the show during Season 8, a story arc was developed around the death of Mr. Edwards' eldest son, John Jr., and the consequences that result. John Jr., who had become an investigative reporter for a Chicago newspaper, was murdered by a corrupt businessman who didn't want his activities becoming public. Mr. Edwards is initially told that it was a street accident that killed John Jr., but as Charles helps him grieve, the two ‚Äì along with the editor and a street urchin ‚Äì uncover the truth. It is John Jr.'s death that causes Mr. Edwards to relapse into deep alcoholism, causing him to lose his logging business and eventually, his family. Distraught, Mr. Edwards returns to Walnut Grove, keeping his dark secrets under wraps until he causes a street accident that seriously injures Albert Ingalls (Charles' adopted son). Charles breaks off his friendship with Mr. Edwards and tells him to leave and never return, leaving Laura as his only hope. Laura and her husband, Almanzo (who are by now married) agree to help reform Mr. Edwards, and it works ... until he gets a letter from Grace telling him she has filed divorce papers. Mr. Edwards tries to break into the Mercantile to obtain alcohol, but when it is locked up, he sees the church and goes in to pray and seek God's forgiveness and guidance; he subsequently reconciles with Charles and eventually becomes Rose Wilder's godfather. During the final season, Mr. Edwards was featured in several episodes, primarily as a comic foil to Harriet Oleson, the snobbish wife of mercantile owner Nels Oleson. However, there were a few serious episodes featuring the character, most notably the two-part episode \\"The Wild Boy,\\" where he agrees to adopt a mute boy who had been abused by a traveling showman. He also plays key roles in the TV films that aired in 1983 and 1984, most notably \\"Bless All the Dear Children.\\" =Little House on the Prairie mini-series (2005)= The character was played by Gregory Sporleder.

The Birmingham Americans defeated the Florida Blazers 22‚Äì21 on Thursday, December 5, 1974 at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. George Mira, quarterback for Birmingham was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP). It was televised on TVS Television Network. Original plans for the World Bowl had the 1974 championship scheduled for November 29, the day after Thanksgiving 1974 at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. However, the WFL decided to expand its playoff field from four to six teams, pushing the championship back a week; furthermore, the host Jacksonville Sharks folded during the season, leading to the league moving the game to the home stadium of the higher seeded playoff team (in this case, Birmingham). A cash prize of $10,000 was brought onto Legion Field for the league's season MVP award, which was split between three players. The league presented the players with actual cash ($1 bills stacked on a table) in lieu of the standard practice of a check in order to avoid the scrutiny of a whether a WFL cheque would even clear the bank. However, after the ceremonies, the locker room of the champion Americans was raided and all team assets, including uniforms, were seized to collect on the team's debts. The day before the playoffs began the IRS had put lien on the Birmingham Americans over a $237,000 tax debt. The league negotiated a deal where the IRS allowed Birmingham to play in exchange for a portion of the gate receipts which were used to help pay off the debt. In addition, the Americans and Blazers players had gone unpaid for several weeks and refused to play until they were paid. It took Birmingham's owner Bill Putnam's promise of championship rings if they won and the league dividing the remaining gate receipts 60/40 (based on who won the game) to settle the dispute. Scoring summary In the WFL, a touchdown was worth 7 points and teams could run or pass (but not kick) from the five yard line for an extra point called an \\"Action Point\\". They could not kick as The creator of the league (Gary Davidson) Thought that goal post were disruptive, and the league was entertainment based, made for fans, rather than players. *First Quarter **No scoring *Second Quarter **Birmingham- Profit 1-yard run (pass failed) 0-7 **Birmingham- Cantrelle 4-yard run (Reed run) 0-15 *Third Quarter **Birmingham- Brown 26-yard pass from Mira (pass failed) 0-22 *Fourth Quarter **Florida- Reamon 39-yard pass from Davis (pass failed) 7-22 **Florida- Latta 40-yard pass from Davis (run failed) 14-22 **Florida- Foster 76-yard punt return (run failed) 21-22 Later use of the term There would be no World Bowl 2. The 1975 World Football League season ended with the league's collapse 12 weeks into its second season with the remainder of that season, including the playoffs being cancelled. The Birmingham Vulcans, who held a league best 9-3 record at the time of the shutdown, were proclaimed league champions. The World Indoor Football League had planned on using the World Bowl name for its championship in 1988, but the league folded without playing any games. The World League of American Football/NFL Europe/NFL Europa used the name in 1991 to 1992, and from 1995 to 2007. When the World Football League was revived as a minor league in 2008, the new league's championship game was also called the World Bowl with the numbering continued from the original. Thus the 2008, 2009, and 2010 championships, all won by the Oklahoma Thunder, were respectively designated World Bowl II, World Bowl III, and World Bowl IV.

Reign of Edward I and marriage Scarborough and Bamburgh Castle (shown here). Isabella de Beaumont was the daughter of Sir Louis de Brienne and Agn√©s de Beaumont, Vicomtesse of Beaumont, probably born during the 1260s.Amateur historians have argued for this date range; Isabella would have been unlikely to have been married before the age of 12, giving her latest year of birth as 1267. See an example of this date range claim here, accessed 12 April 2010. The de Beaumonts were a powerful noble family with French origins. Isabella herself was the granddaughter of John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, by his third wife, Berengaria of Leon, the daughter of Berengaria of Castile. Through her Castilian great-grandmother, Isabella was a cousin of Edward I's wife, Eleanor of Castile. Isabella was therefore a particularly well-connected member of a noble family that stretched across Europe.Stringer, p.204. Isabella arrived in England in either 1278 or 1279, and married John de Vesci, a prominent noble, in either 1279 or 1280,Stringer, p.204, p.212; Mitchell, p.94. with Edward I's blessing. The marriage was an advantageous one for John de Vesci, but also strengthened Isabella's English credentials at the Plantagenet court, where John ‚Äì a close associate of both Henry III and Edward I ‚Äì was a central figure. Isabella continued to enjoy royal favour; for her wedding, she was given valuable lands by the king to hold in her own right, for example.Mitchell, p.95. When Isabella and her husband travelled to Gascony in 1288, Edward arranged for them to have apartments next to his own royal lodgings and had them specially decorated for Christmas.Stringer, p.204. Isabella was one of the closest friends of the Queen, up until Eleanor's death in 1290.Parsons, p.34. Isabella de Beaumont was also made the governor of two royal castles, Scarborough Castle in Yorkshire and Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland, her main power base,Stopes, p.49. subject to her remaining single and unmarried.Mitchell, p.99. Being granted governorships of castles close to conflict areas was unheard of for a woman of the period, and Edward probably did so on the basis of Isabella's personal loyalty to him.Mitchell, p.99. Nonetheless, the actual appointment to Bamburgh was not done entirely regularly ‚Äì the Great Seal was not applied to the appointment ‚Äì and this would cause Isabella later problems.See Prestwich's analysis of this. John de Vesci died in 1289, and after Isabella took her brother in law, William de Vesci to court over various of John's lands, she was left a major landowner in England.Philipot, p.134; Mitchell, p.95. William de Vesci also married a woman named Isabella de Vesci, which can cause some historical confusion. Isabella's lands stretched from Scotland to Kent, and after William de Vesci's disastrous fall from royal favour in Ireland, Isabella effectively became the most senior member of the Beaumont/Vescy family alliance.Mitchell, p.96. In 1300, Isabella's brother, Henry, arrived in England, where Isabella convinced the king to grant him lands formerly owned by her late husband.Mitchell, p.96. Isabella was also responsible for organising the marriage of her brother Henry to the niece of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, in turn ensuring that Henry inherited the earldom and many Scottish properties.Mitchell, p.94. In combination, the de Beaumont family also held numerous properties in the disputed kingdom of Scotland, which would come to influence later events. Early years under Edward II Isabella of France, Queen to Edward II of England; Isabella de Beaumont was a close friend to her, but would ultimately turn against the Queen in 1330. Isabella, together with her brother, Henry de Beaumont, in due course became important figures at the court of Edward II of England after the death of Edward in 1307. Her other immediate family included Louis de Beaumont. Isabella de Beaumont became a lady-in-waiting and close friend to the young Isabella of France when she came from France to marry Edward in 1308.Weir, p.29. The two Isabellas frequently corresponded when apart,Weir, p.57. which was quite frequent as, like other members of Queen Isabella's court, Isabella de Beaumont had feudal responsibilities elsewhere in the kingdom.Weir, p.76. Isabella de Beaumont played a role in many key political events. Politics under the early reign of Edward II saw huge tensions between different factions within England. Edward, at this stage with the support of his young wife Queen Isabella, had formed a close attachment to his favourite and lover Piers Gaveston. Opposing Edward was a Lancastrian faction of powerful barons, as well as groupings of Marcher lords in Wales and further factions in Kent. The de Beaumonts had allied themselves to Queen Isabella, who ‚Äì in the early part of Edward's reign ‚Äì was perceived by the Lancastrians as an ally of Gaveston. Further more, Thomas of Lancaster himself perceived Isabella and Henry as unwelcome newcomers in the north of England ‚Äì the de Vesci had a long history there, longer than Lancaster's own, but Isabella was a foreigner, come to wealth and power by royal favour.Mitchell, p.94. Lancaster also disliked the close friendship that had existed between Isabella and his father-in-law, Henry de Lacy.Mitchel, p.95. As a result, when the Lancastrians pushed through the Ordinances of 1311, which sought to circumscribe royal power, Isabella and her brother were banished from court.Weir, p.58. Isabella was accused of giving \\"evil council\\" and illegally securing writs for her clients, and returned to her home in Yorkshire for a short period.Weir, p.58. Baronial attempts were made to remove Isabella from her governorship of Bamburgh castle; Edward II wrote to her instructing her to delay as long as possible, and Isabella hung on, eventually agreeing to surrender the castle in exchange for lands in Lincolnshire and Dorset. Even then, she handed the castle over to one of Edward's clerks, not a baron.Mitchell, p.100. Isabella de Beaumont soon engineered her return to court in 1313, overturning the ordinances,Mitchell, p.100. and in the coming years, Isabella and Henry increasingly relied upon Queen Isabella for protection and support, in return supporting her politically. The Queen sent Isabella many gifts, including brie cheese from FranceWeir, p.87. and wild boar meat.Doherty, p.49. Isabella accompanied the King and Queen on diplomatic visits to France.Weir, p.96. Through the Queen, Isabella was instrumental in getting another of her brothers, the extravagant and illiterate Louis de Beaumont, another opponent of the Lancastrians, appointed Bishop of Durham in 1317.Weir, p.108; Tout pp91-2. Louis assured the king that he would form a \\"stone wall\\" against any Scottish invasion from the north.Weir, p.151. Opposition to the Despensers After 1322 and the Despenser War, Edward II had temporarily quashed the Lancastrian factions; his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger had replaced the late Piers Gaveston.Doherty, pp80-1. Edward and Queen Isabella became increasingly divided, however, with matters coming to a head after Edward's failed invasion of Scotland, which led to Queen Isabella being effectively abandoned by Edward and the Despensers, and almost captured by the Scots who pursued her across Yorkshire. Queen Isabella blamed Edward and the Despensers; the king blamed Louis de Beaumont, whose \\"stone wall\\" was clearly less robust than hoped, and Isabella de Beaumont ‚Äì as Louis's sister and a close friend of Queen Isabella ‚Äì lost the favour they had previously enjoyed with Edward.Weir, p.151. Indeed, both Queen Isabella and the de Beaumonts rapidly found themselves on the wrong side of the Despensers' increasingly despotic regime.Doherty, pp80-1. Isabella has been described as a \\"silent partner\\" in Queen Isabella's increasing hostility toward the king.Mitchell, p.100. By 1326 Queen Isabella had grown desperate and left for Paris, ostensibly to conduct diplomacy over the disputed province of Gascony, but in reality in an attempt to raise a rebellion against Edward and the Despensers. Isabella de Beaumont and Henry had meanwhile turned openly against Edward; royal officials were being attacked by de Vesci forces across Yorkshire.Doherty, p.89. Isabella invaded England shortly afterwards, accompanied by her lover, Roger de Mortimer, deposing Edward ‚Äì the de Vesci family now looked forward to enjoying the support of the court once more. One of the first acts of the new regime was to appoint the late earl of Atholl's young son to the custodianship of Isabella, who then married him to one her nieces, thereby giving her and Henry control of two out of the five Scottish earldoms.Mitchell, p.102. Isabella and the fall of Queen Isabella One of the major political dilemmas of Queen Isabella's new regime was the problem of the Scottish wars ‚Äì England could not easily afford to continue them, but any peace with the Scots could have major implications for English landowners with estates in the north. Queen Isabella and Mortimer opted for peace, with the result that families such the Beaumonts lost considerable property.Mitchell, p.103. This marked the end of Isabella's friendship with Queen Isabella, and Isabella and Henry broke with the new court and increasingly became part of the opposition movement.Mitchell, p.103. In 1330, Edmund of Kent attempted to lead an uprising against Queen Isabella, with the aim of restoring Edward II, whom many believed still to be alive at this time. Isabella had a key part in this conspiracy, using her confessor to send messages between Edmund and William Melton, the archbishop of York.Weir, p.331. Queen Isabella and Mortimer uncovered the plot and executed Edmund, but Isabella herself escaped arrest.Weir, pp.333‚Äì4. Edward III overthrew Mortimer later in the year, and Isabella de Beaumont therefore found herself back in royal favour for the last few years of her life, receiving additional lands in North Wales.Mitchell, p.103. Isabella died without issue in 1334, being buried at the Black Friars abbey at Scarborough;Mitchell, p.103. her brother Henry inherited her lands.Philipot, p.134.

There is a recognised hierarchy of hazard controls which is listed in a generally descending order of effectiveness and preference: * Elimination - the compete removal or avoidance of the hazard also removes the risk. * Substitution - A less hazardous or lower risk material, equipment or process may be available. * Isolation - If the hazard can be separated from the people or equipment at risk by barriers or demarcated areas. the risk is reduced. * Safeguards - Tools or equipment, can be modified by fitting guards, interlocks and similar engineering solutions. * Procedural methods ‚Äì Safer ways to do something. * Personal protective equipment and clothing (PPE) is the last resort. A combination of two or more of these methods may be most effective, or even necessary.

PlavƒÉ»õ was born in E»ôelni»õa, in South-Eastern Banat, to a family of poor peasants. Due to material difficulties, in 1927 he was forced to leave high school, and in autumn he enrolled in the Apprentices' School of the Romanian Railways (CFR) in Timi»ôoara. Here he came into contact with communist ideas and became an active member of the local worker movement. After finishing school, he was hired as a carpenter in the Timi»ôoara CFR Workshops, and soon afterwards was elected a member in the committee of the local trade union. His political activism was seen as dangerous by the Workshops' management, and led to his reassignment to a marginal branch of the enterprise. PlavƒÉ»õ returned to Timi»ôoara in the first years of World War II, rejoining the Workshops, and becoming a leading member of the local clandestine organisation of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). As Romania's dictator Ion Antonescu had joined Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, PlavƒÉ»õ and others participated in the sabotage of the war production of the Axis. Arrested along other workers of the Workshops in autumn 1942, he was ultimately released due to lack of evidence. In May 1944, as the tide of war had turned against the Axis, the Romanian Communist Party's Banat chapter, led by Leontin SƒÉlƒÉjan, decided to organise a group of partisans in the mountainous area of the region. »òtefan PlavƒÉ»õ was given the political command of the MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti detachment, active in the Cara»ô Mountains, in the area of his native village. The headquarters was established on the Semenic Mountain, and the main actions of the partisan detachment involved sabotaging of the rail line linking Timi»ôoara with Re»ôi»õa, an important industrial centre controlled by the Germans, and Bucharest, Romania's capital. On the morning of June 13, 1944, due to a betrayal of a captured partisan, Siguran»õa, the Romanian secret police, and the Gendarmerie surrounded the detachment. As the partisans refused to surrender, a gunfight ensued between them and the government troops. Although most of the partisans succeeded in escaping in the thick forest, PlavƒÉ»õ was mortally wounded. After the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu was overthrown, and especially after the Romanian Communist Party gained the power in Romania, »òtefan PlavƒÉ»õ was one of the several anti-fascist fighters acclaimed as heroes by the official propaganda. Several streets, parks and schools were thus named after him in the area of Banat.

Background Richard Throssel was born in Marengo, Washington in 1882. Throssel is best known for his photographs of the Crow Reservation from 1902-1911. These photographs of the Crows, which cover ceremonies, dances, scenes of everyday life, as well as individual and group portraits, are not only priceless historical documents they are, very simply, beautiful photographs.Richards, Lew. \\"Crow Indian Photographer, The Work of Richard Throssel. \\" Rev. of: Whispering Wind 32.3 (2002): 31. Ethnic NewsWatch (ENW), ProQuest. Though Throssel was not Crow, his quarter blood of Canadian Cree heritage and 1906 adoption into the Crow Nation afforded him intimate moments, which non-Indian photographers could not experience with the Crow People of Montana. After a long bought with rheumatism, it was recommended he live in a drier climate. At the age of twenty, Throssel moved to the Crow Reservation in Montana as a clerk for the Indian Services office. He was exposed to the outstanding art environment that existed on the Crow Reservation. Throssel observed stunning Crow beading, narrative ledger art, and the paintings and photographs of non-Indian artists, Joseph Henry Sharp and Edward S. Curtis. Through painting lessons with Sharp, Throssel learned not only technique; he acquired the principles of design and composition. Career Throssel began to photograph shortly after arriving on the Crow Reservation, but it was not until 1905 that \\"Throssel submitted his first set of photographs, twenty-nine in number, for copyright.\\"Albright, 26 This same year Throssel met ethnographer and photographer Edward S. Curtis. Curtis' influence on Throssel was apparent in Throssel's 1907 set of copyrighted images. In this series Throssel employed vivid lighting with sometimes-staged arrangements, lending towards a much more sentimental view of Crow life. Throssel was also well known for his photographs of \\"Crow couples, families and children, which are especially striking as the love and warmth expressed by the families are so contrary to how we normally see Native men, women, and children depicted in early photography\\"Alison, Jane. Native Nations: journeys in American Photography. London: Barbican Art Gallery in association with Booth-Clibborn Eds., 1998. Print. (Alison 235). Even though Throssel was part of the early clich√© style of depicting Native Peoples his approach also lent itself towards photographs of subjects caught in the moment. The Indian subjects of his photographs expressed a sense of familiarity that cannot be found in the work of non-Indian photographers. Throssel continued to photograph the Crow Nation for the Wanamaker Expedition of 1908 and the Indian Service in 1909. After resigning as photographer for the Indian Service, Throssel with his wife of five years moved to Billings, Montana to open up his own commercial photography business, The Throssel Photographic Company. It was here that he organized a brochure of his photographs, which he was renowned for entitled Western Classics. In less than a decade, Throssel built a personal collection of nearly 1,000 photographs, including 180 portraits of Crow people, 99 portraits of other American Indians, 186 tipi scenes, 63 Crow sacred and secular ceremonial images, and 352 images of daily life among the Crows of MontanaMarien, Mary Warner. \\"Shooting back: The life and work of one of the earliest Native American photographers.\\" Christian Science Monitor 89.192 (1997): B2. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 19 April 2010. In 1917, after a successful career as an artist, Throssel was twice elected Yellowstone County's representative to the Montana Legislature.

Biography A genealogical chart found at Jerusalem traced his descent from Eli the priest.Yerushalmi Ta'anit 4:2; Genesis Rabbah 118:13 He was very wealthy; he is said to have planted four hundred vineyards (though they may have been small vineyards)Bava Batra 14a and to have given an orchard to the public.Moed Kattan 12b His first residence was at Sepphoris,Yerushalmi Berachot 4:6 where he seems to have held a public office, since at the death of R. Judah ha-Nasi he gave an order that even priests might attend Judah's funeral.Yerushalmi Berachot 3:1 Halevy, however, has concluded that Yannai always lived at 'Akbara, or 'Akbari, where he established a school (see below). He was a student of R. Judah haNasi, in whose name he transmitted several halakhic sayings.Yerushalmi Hagigah 3:2; Yerushalmi Kiddushin 3:14; et al. The best known of his senior fellow students was Hiyya the Great, who, as an assistant teacher in Rabbi's school, sometimes acted as Yannai's tutor.Yerushalmi Demai 7:1; Yevamot 93a But several discussions between Hiyya and YannaiYerushalmi Berachot 4:5, and Bavli passim show the real relationship. Their friendship was afterward cemented by the marriage of Yannai's daughter to Hiyya's son Judah.Yerushalmi Bikkurim 3:3; Ketuvot 62b Yannai transmitted also some halakhot in the name of the council (\\"haburah\\") of the last tannaim.Makkot 21b He established an important school at 'Akbara,Yerushalmi Eruvin 8:4 often mentioned in both Talmuds and in the Midrash as the \\"debei R. Yannai\\" or the \\"beit R. Yannai,\\" and which continued after his death. His school differed from others in that the pupils were treated as belonging to the master's family; they worked on Yannai's estate, took their share of the revenue, and lived under his roof.Compare Yerushalmi Shevuot 8:6 His chief pupil, of whom he thought highly, was Rabbi Yochanan, who transmitted most of his halakhot.Yerushalmi Kilaim 8:1; Sotah 18b; Kiddushin 64b Others of his many pupils were Simeon ben Lakish,Yerushalmi Yoma 3:10; Ta'anit 2:6; Hullin 82a Rabbi AibuKiddushin 19 and R. Hoshaiah Rabbah.Ketuvot 79a Teachings Yannai was prominent both as halakhist and aggadist. His name is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud 176 times, and in the Jerusalem Talmud 254 times. He shared Hiyya's opinion regarding to the Mishnah; he granted it no greater authority than to the collections of halakhot or baraitot compiled by Hiyya and other disciples of Judah haNasi.Compare Yerushalmi Pesachim 1:5; Yerushalmi Yoma 4:2 When his pupil R. Johanan remarked that the Mishnah rendered a decision different from his, he answered, \\"The Mishnah gives only the decision of a single tanna, while I decide conformably to the Rabbis as a whole\\".Shabbat 140a He was independent in his decisions, and sometimes had all his contemporaries against him.Yerushalmi Niddah 3:4; Shabbat 65a His decisions were generally rigid regarding individuals,Yerushalmi Berachot 2:6; Yerushalmi Ketuvot 1:10; Shabbat 14a but liberal when the whole community was concerned. Yannai's disregard of R. Judah Nesi'ah, Rabbi's grandson, was notorious,Bava Batra 111a,b and so was his attitude toward Hanina bar Hama, an ardent believer in Rabbi's Mishnah.Yerushalmi Kilaim 9:7; Berachot 30a; et al. Yannai said in reference to Hanina, \\"He who studies the Law under only one teacher sees no sign of blessing\\".Avodah Zarah 19a Yannai is conspicuous in both Talmud and Midrash as a prolific aggadist, and he occupies an important place among the Biblical exegetes of his time. In reference to a man who studied much but did not fear God, he said: \\"Woe to the man who, before he gets a house, makes the door\\".Shabbat 31b He recommended submission to the government.Zevachim 102a; Menachot 98a When old age had impaired his sight he requested Mar Ukba to send him some eye-salves prepared by Samuel.Shabbat 108b He enjoined his children to bury him neither in white nor in black clothes, as they would not know whether his place would be in paradise or in hell.Shabbat 114a; Yerushalmi Kilaim 9:4 References It has the following bibliography: * Bacher, Ag.

Life and career  Born in Denny, Falkirk, McCulloch started his career as a player with his hometown Junior club Denny Hibernian, before turning professional when he joined Falkirk in July 1913. Within eight years of joining the club, he was made team captain and played over 160 first-team matches. He also made several appearances on the Scottish Junior International team during his time with Falkirk. In the summer of 1921, McCulloch moved to Heart of Midlothian on a free transfer. He spent one season with Hearts before joining Football League Third Division North side Nelson for a fee of ¬£150 in June 1922. McCulloch made his Nelson debut in the first match of the 1922‚Äì23 season, a 2‚Äì6 loss to Bradford Park Avenue on 26 August 1922. He scored his first goal for the club the following week in the return match at Seedhill.Dykes, p. 76 After appearing in all of the first 23 matches of the campaign, he spent a spell out of the side following the signing of Dick Crawshaw. McCulloch returned to the first-team towards the end of the season, playing the final four games of the season at the unfamiliar position of right half-back. Altogether, he played 28 matches and scored six goals in his first season with Nelson, as the team finished champions of the Third Division North, thereby gaining promotion to the Football League Second Division for the first time in their history.Dykes, p. 6 It was McCulloch who scored Nelson's first ever goal in the Second Division, in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Clapton Orient on 25 August 1923.Dykes, p. 77 After three matches of the season, he was again moved to right half-back, a position which he kept for the rest of the first half of the campaign. Following the 1‚Äì1 draw with Fulham on 22 December 1923, McCulloch was dropped from the team and spent a long period in the reserves. Nelson supporters made clear their disappointment at the omission of McCulloch, by writing several letters to the Nelson Leader, questioning the team selection. He was briefly reinstated to the team at the end of the season, scoring in the 1‚Äì3 defeat to Leicester City before playing his final match for Nelson on 26 April 1924 in the 0‚Äì1 loss to Leeds United. McCulloch joined Third Division North side Chesterfield on a free transfer in June 1924. However, he found it difficult to break into the first-team, playing only three matches for the club before leaving to join Football League Third Division South outfit Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic in March 1925. He scored one goal in 10 league appearances for Bournemouth before being released at the end of the season. McCulloch returned to his native town in Scotland and had a short spell with Scottish Football League Second Division club St Bernard's before retiring from football. He remained in Scotland following the conclusion of his football career, and died in Edinburgh on 21 August 1973, at the age of 82.

EPA sits within the portfolio of Energy, Environment and Climate Change; the Minister of which is the Hon. Lily D‚ÄôAmbrosio MP as of December 2019. History Established under the Environment Protection Act 1970, EPA is the world's third oldest environmental regulatory agency.\\"Between a rock and a hard place. The story of the development of the EPA\\", EPA Victoria, 1996, p.13. It was established to address environmental problems across the state in a systematic and integrated way, bringing together a range of legislation and powers to be administered by a central authority. In July 2021 the Environment Protection Amendment Act 2018 will come into effect, transforming the structure under which EPA works. The cornerstone of the new Act is the general environmental duty, which states that all persons (i.e. legal entities, including corporations) who are undertaking any activity which poses a risk of harm to human health or to the environment has a duty to minimise those risks so far as is reasonably practicable.  Authorised Officers  The EP Act allows EPA to appoint individuals to the role of authorised officer. The appointed officers can then exercise powers given to them under the EP Act. The primary role of EPA‚Äôs authorised officers is to ensure that businesses, government and individuals comply with the EP Act. They do this by: * inspecting businesses and premises * providing guidance and advice about how to comply * enforcing the law ‚Äì requiring risks and impacts to be remedied * where necessary, applying sanctions or punishment to deter non-compliance. EPA has authorised officers working in specialised areas such as motor vehicles and litter, who only exercise powers specific to their roles. See EPA authorisations: roles and powers policy (Publication 1478) for more information. The EPA Authorised Officers brochure (Publication 1422) provides the community and EPA duty holders, such as EPA licensed and non-licensed businesses, with an easy-to- understand summary of the role and powers of authorised officers. = Informants = EPA informants are authorised officers who lead and conduct major investigations undertaken by EPA.

A notice of contravention will be issued where there is a major ongoing contravention and further enforcement action is planned; and prepare briefs of evidence. = Senior staff = Managers and team leaders responsible for licensing, works approvals, permitting, notifiable chemicals and planning referrals, are delegated to decide on applications for approvals and to respond to planning referrals. Where a remedial notice requires the recipient to undertake works at a cost above a certain level, the power to approve the remedial notice is delegated to specific EPA managers and executives from EPA's Regional Services Directorate, and the CEO.

Founded in 1741 as the first Baptist place of worship in the area, it attracted a congregation of General Baptists whose theological views gradually moved towards Unitarianism. This led to their union with the members of the nearby Westgate Chapel, after which the flint and brick building housed other congregations and secular groups before its conversion to a house. The building is protected as a Grade II by English Heritage. History Lewes is an ancient borough and market town on the River Ouse. The adjacent village of Southover, now part of the town, was chosen by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey in the 11th century as the site for his Cluniac Priory dedicated to St Pancras. The area went on to develop a strong Protestant Nonconformist tradition in the 18th and 19th centuries: denominations such as the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, Unitarianism, Methodism, Quakers, Baptists, Strict Baptists, Presbyterianism and Congregationalism were all represented. The General Baptist Chapel, the first Baptist place of worship in the area, was founded at Southover in 1741, possibly by a group associated with an earlier church (now Unitarian) at nearby Ditchling. Another Baptist congregation, this time consisting of Particular Baptists, started worshipping in Lewes in 1784; they moved to Eastgate Chapel in 1843. In the 19th century, most General Baptist congregations in Sussex gradually adopted Unitarian views, following the lead of Matthew Caffyn who was influential at the General Baptist chapel (now Unitarian) in Horsham. The members of the Southover chapel were no exception, and in 1825 they decided to unite with the congregation of Westgate Chapel, a Unitarian meeting house founded in Lewes town centre in 1695. The chapel became a meeting house used by other religious groups, including for a time The Salvation Army. Secular groups also used it, but in 1972 it was sold and converted into a cottage. It was altered inside, and the burial ground at the rear was covered with concrete (although some headstones were dug up and preserved). Southover General Baptist Chapel‚Äîunder its new name of The Old Meeting‚Äîwas listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 29 October 1985. Architecture The single-storey chapel faces north and is built of knapped flint in the Vernacular style. There are quoins and dressings of red brick. The hipped roof is tiled. A modern porch with weatherboarding and a gable covers the original entrance door, above which is a stone marked . Flanking the porch are two shallow-arched sash windows which have lost their original wooden shutters. There is also a small casement window at the top right.

Historically, terms such as \\"half-breeds\\" or \\"settlers\\" were used (the former was also commonly used to refer to the M√©tis)https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/etudinuit/2015-v39-n1-etudinuit02454/1036085ar/. Terms today include \\"Inuit-M√©tis\\", \\"Southern Inuit\\" and \\"Kablun√¢ngajuit\\".  History  = Arrival in southern Labrador = The people are the sole ancestors of the southern Inuit of Labrador who have, they claim, continuously occupied and used the region for almost a thousand years, long before the Government of Newfoundland made any real foray into the area in the early 20th century.The Story of Labrador by Bill Rompkey Publisher: Montreal : McGill- Queen's University Press, 2003. DDC: 971.82 LCC: FC2149.4 Edition: (bound) According to one theory, the Inuit arrived in Labrador in the 15th century from Baffin Island. Archeological evidence shows they lived as far south as the Sandwich Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador) area.http://www.heritage.nf.ca/aboriginal/metis.html = Contact with Europeans = The Inuit were in conflict with the Basque and French whalers beginning in the mid-1500s. = Treaty of 1765 = Following the defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, Britain laid claim to Labrador. The British governor of Newfoundland Sir Hugh Palliser signed a treaty with the southern Labrador Inuit in 1765.http://www.nunatukavut.ca/home/files/pg/british- inuit_treaty_1765.pdf = Metisage = During the 19th century, some European men, settled, took Inuit wives, and permanently assimilated into the local culture. Although influenced in many ways by prolonged contact with seasonal workers and merchants, the culture and way of life has remained distinctly Inuit.Royal Commission White Paper on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada Distribution NunatuKavut consists of a region of southern Labrador that encompasses communities from Lodge Bay (located on the Lodge River) to the communities located on the coast of Sandwich Bay (Paradise River and Cartwright). However, there are notable populations of people of mixed European and Inuit descent in other parts of Labrador too. Many Inuit in the southern parts of Nunatsiavut are descended from fur traders that worked in the region. NunatuKavut also has a large diaspora in many other parts of Labrador such as Happy Valley-Goose Bay and the communities located along the Strait of Belle Isle and NunatuKavut also has a large diaspora living on the island of Newfoundland. Many residents of the Quebec community of St. Augustine (known officially as \\"Saint-Augustin\\") are also of Inuit and European descent.http://www.thelowernorthshore.com/lns/images/d/d1/St- Augustin_Hab-1-.pdf  Organization  The organization claiming to speak for the Labrador Inuit-Metis, was originally called the Labrador M√©tis Nation, and was formed in the early 1980s. In 2010 that group changed its name to Nunatukavut (the same as the territory they claim).http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland- labrador/story/2010/04/13/nl-nunatukavut-413.html They are members of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples along with other non-Status Aboriginal groups.  Land claim  The Labrador Inuit-Metis claim NunatuKavut as their homeland, and are in process of launching an Aboriginal land claim with the Canadian courts. They are also active in the debates over the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project, and the dam at Muskrat Falls.

It was founded in 2002 as a branch of Origins International, which is based in New South Wales, Australia. Origins Canada provides services including an online search-and-reunion registry, support groups, peer support for those separated by adoption, and a first-contact service for reuniting families.Origins Canada website http://www.originscanada.org Aims and Objectives The stated Aims and Objectives of the organization are: *SUPPORT: To provide confidential support and resources to those separated from their families by adoption in safe and secure environments. *EDUCATION:To provide resources and education for those considering adoption and to advise governments, mental health professionals and others with respect to adoption policies, practices, and adoption trauma. *REUNION: To assist in the reunion of family members separated by adoption. *REDRESS: To seek acknowledgement, validation, accountability and redress for illegal and unethical adoption practices. *RESEARCH: To undertake and promote research into adoption policies and practices past and present. *REFORM: To encourage and promote legislative, social and administrative reforms that honour and respect the mother-child bond, support the preservation of natural families, meet the needs of those already separated by adoption, and abolish reproductive exploitation. The organization advocates for a federal inquiry/committee to investigate illegal, unethical and human rights abuses in adoption practice in Canada. A sister organization Origins Australia, obtained two State Inquiries, and finally, a National Senate Inquiry which culminated in an apology to those separated by adoption from the Prime Minister of Australia on March 21, 2013 for adoption policies which included illegal and unethical practices as well as human rights abuses. The policies and practices uncovered by the Australian Inquiry mirror those experienced by over 350,000 women in Canada systematically separated from their children by adoption during the post WWII decades because of their unmarried status. In October 2013 Origins Canada hosted a meeting with MPs in Ottawa to educate and formally request a Senate Inquiry/Committee to Investigate. A historic meeting was held on June 15, 2012 with the major Canadian churches at United Church Headquarters entitled ‚ÄúA Way Forward.‚Äù In attendance were high level executives of every major Canadian church involved in Maternity Homes in Canada including Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican, United, and Salvation Army. The United Church of Canada is developing a liturgy for those separated by adoption in conjunction with Origins Canada. See their website for further information on the United Church response. (United Church of Canada website: https://web.archive.org/web/20131211200941/http://www.united- church.ca/communications/news/general/131122 ) Currently only four provinces and one territory have open adoption records. Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Newfoundland and Yukon Territory. In 2010, Origins Canada made a presentation to the Toronto and East York Community Council supporting the preservation of the heritage building at 450 Pape Avenue. For part of its history, this building was operated by the Salvation Army as a maternity facility for the confinement of unwed pregnant mothers. On May 16, 2011, Origins Canada, represented by its Executive Director, Valerie Andrews, presented to the Ontario Legislature's Standing Committee on Social Policy, regarding Bill 179, \\"Building Families and Supporting Youth to be Successful Act, 2011.\\" The presentation raised concerns that key stakeholders who would be affected by the act were not consulted about it, and that the rights of natural parents would be jeopardized, with the law permitting babies to be apprehended at birth, only 30 days before the child becomes available for adoption by a Children's Aid Society, no guarantee of notice being given to the parents of the adoption hearing, and no means for the parents to contest the adoption.

Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures.

German-registered nurses are called Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger (health- and sickness carer). Previously, the official name for a nurse practicing in Germany was Krankenschwester (female) and Krankenpfleger (male). Ribonia Hoaes  To become registered as a nurse, an individual needs to take and pass an official state exam in nursing. Different departments (in [Baden-W√ºrttemberg] f.i. the Regierungspr√§sidium) are responsible for registration in different locations of the country. Education A German nurse In most cases, nurses learn the profession in a special nursing school that is often connected to a hospital. Before matriculating, individuals are required to complete several weeks of practical training in a hospital setting. The nursing course is completed according to EU regulations, and is three years long, including around 2100 hours for theoretical knowledge and 2500 hours of practical training in different hospital settings. Salary In the first year of education, nurses are paid about 750-800 Euro per month. In the second year of education, nurses are paid about 800-900 Euro per month. In the third and last year of education, nurses are paid about 930-1030 Euro per month. There are some changes to be expected in the future as it is now possible to study nursing on a B.Sc. basis (mostly in universities of applied sciences). But individuals still need to pass the official state exam to become a registered nurse. Some universities offer a special program with local nursing schools wherein students earn the B.Sc. and accordant state registration. Some universities offer post-graduate studies leading to a master's degree and the possibility to continue studies for a Ph.D. degree. There are also nursing helpers who attend a one-year program in nursing school. This may change again with the introduction of university nursing curricula. Specializing There are different ways to specialize after the nursing schools, called Fachweiterbildung. Salaries are typically higher with a Fachweiterbildung. Specialization includes some 720‚Äì800 hours of theoretical education and practical training. In the end, there is a state exam or writing of a thesis. There are official two year specializations in: *ICU and anesthesia *OR *oncology *home care *psychiatric *palliative care *quality management *hygienic *ward manager It is possible for nurses to undergo a variety of shorter programs to continue learning and enhance their knowledge (e.g. wound management, oncology, palliative care, etc.). Working as a nurse In hospitals, there are mostly working registered nurses and nursing students. Registered nurses in Germany take care of the patients and there are different systems who and how the patients are treated: (a) taking care of a set of patients including all work that needs to be done or (b) taking care of the patients on a ward doing just one special function. Work includes planning based on the patients' needs and condition, documenting, writing about the progress and current condition. Preparation of medication is in the hands of nurses and its application: tablets, infusion etc. but not the i.v. application by syringe (except in the ICU). Blood samples and setup of venflos are not done by nurses (except in the ICU), but mostly done by students of medicine or doctors, even if it is in the curriculum. All basic care is done by registered nurses or coordinated and done by the nursing students. Special care like setting up urine catheters, nasogastric tubes, treatment of wounds and wound dressings are done by registered nurses or nurse students (under supervision). Job satisfaction Job satisfaction is not the best in Germany because of the heavy work-load, low salaries and a low appreciation of the nurse profession in the public. Even some politicians in the past claimed that everybody is able to nurse. The nurse associations are working hard to achieve the acceptance for the installation of nursing chairs in universities but they are often undermined by politicians who are looking for the cheapest work force but not skilled and professional workers. UK Nurses wanting to work in Germany In Germany, all nurses who want to work in their nursing profession have to have their qualification recognized by applying for an \\"Anerkennung\\". This is through the official administrative body responsible for licensing health care professionals which varies from state to state. Requirements include: language proficiency of level B2 in German, registration with the Nursing Midwifery Council (NMC), evidence of nursing education (including an academic transcript and degree certificate which may need to be translated into German), evidence of current residence, evidence of allowance to work in the EU, and evidence that your Nursing education meets the \\"EU Berufsanerkennungsrichtlinie/2005/36/EG\\" standards.

Due to the song's popularity, the group renamed to Zangal√©wa during its mainstream success. Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves,NYT: Shakira Remixes African Hit for World Cup and used the song in fund-raising efforts for Comic Relief. Background The languages present in the song's lyrics (Douala, French, Jamaican Patois, and the pidgin English of some parts of West Africa)\\"Emile Kojidie: The Golden Voice of the Golden Sounds.\\" make clear that the song originates from the area of Cameroon but the circumstances surrounding the time of the song's origin are less clear. Some sources indicate that the lyrics are, at the very least, a lament from the point of view of a single soldier, but other aspects of the song, including the way it is frequently performed (see cultural context section), has led to conflicting claims that the song is a tribute to African soldiers of World War II or a criticism of Africans who collaborated with European colonial authorities. The song is still used today almost everywhere in Africa by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen, and their supporters, usually during training or for rallying. It is particularly popular in Cameroon, where it is used as a marching song or rallying cry. The song was popularized in Colombia under the name \\"the Military\\" and \\"El sacalengua\\" (\\"The one who sticks out his tongue\\", due to the similarity with the name of the song) by DJs fond of African music based in Barranquilla and Cartagena. Cultural context In the music video for the 1986 release and in other performances of the song, performers often dress in military uniforms, wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes in certain places with pillows to give the appearance of being well-off and associated with European colonial authorities. This appearance and the lyrics, according to some music historians, is a criticism of African military officers who were in league with whites and profited from the oppression of their own people during the era of European imperialist colonization. Some elements of the song incorporate Cameroonian slang and Cameroonian military jargon from World War II. According to Jean Paul Z√© Bella, the lead singer of Golden Sounds, the chorus came \\"from Cameroonian sharpshooters who had created a slang for better communication between them during the Second World War\\"; the band initially recreated the fast pace of the military communication in their first arrangements of the song. Variants, covers, and sampling The song became internationally popular when the international pop star Shakira released a variant (as a tribute to African music) titled \\"Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)\\" in anticipation of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.Freshlyground - Official blog Before \\"Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)\\" was released in 2010, the song was sampled or covered by other artists, including: * Las Chicas Del Can - El negro no puede (1988) whosampled.com * Beatmachine (Suriname) - Samina Mina * Adane Best * Los Condes * Vic Nees * Tom Pease in Daddy Starts To Dance!

Geology The course of the lower Eel River changes from northeasterly to westerly as it encounters a resistant formation of fossiliferous upper Pliocene marine sandstone 15 miles (25 kilometers) inland from the Pacific Ocean. River turbulence has created deep pools beneath steep sandstone cliffs on the northeasterly bank. Tributary streams, including Nanning Creek, cut steep, narrow canyons through the cliffs. The southwesterly bank of the river is an alluvial plain extending to the estuary. The community of Rio Dell occupies the bank opposite the cliffs.Strand, Rudolph G. Geologic Map of California:Redding Sheet (1962) State of California Resources Agency The cliffs expose abundant remains of ancient clams and sand dollars. History Pacific Lumber Company built a railroad across the face of the cliffs between 1883 and 1885 to transport lumber to Eureka, California. This alignment was followed by the Northwestern Pacific Railroad to avoid bridging the lower Eel River. The rail line maintained an elaborate series of benches, retaining walls, and trestles approximately 50 feet (16 meters) above the river during low summer flows, and the cliffs extend 75 to 500 feet (25‚Äì150 meters) above the track. These trestles and benches have been frequently damaged by floods and by massive blocks of sandstone falling from the upper cliffs. Rail service was interrupted in 1907, 1913, 1933, 1938, 1942, 1946, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1964 and 1971. A railroad bridge crew was assigned to work exclusively on the Scotia Bluff trestles from 1916 through 1959. Flood waters reached track level in 1955 and were 11 feet (3.3 m) over the railway in 1964.

He was trained in veterinary medicine. He held various administrative positions under the military governments before 1999. He was Minister of Communications from June 2001 to May 2003. After he left office, he was indicted in a bribery scandal involving the German telecom company Siemens AG. He was Defense Minister from July 2011 until June 2012. He was appointed the acting National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party of Nigeria on 25 May 2015. Early years Haliru Mohammed Bello was born in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State on 9 October 1945. After his primary education in Birnin Kebbi, he attended Government College, Zaria, now Berewa College. He was admitted to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1966, and studied veterinary medicine. He became a lecturer at Ahmadu Bello University and a Fellow of the College of Veterinary Surgeons of Nigeria. In 1977 Mohammed was appointed Commissioner for Agriculture for Sokoto State under the military government of General Olusegun Obasanjo, and then Commissioner for Education for Sokoto State. After the return to civilian rule in 1979, Mohammed ran unsuccessfully for Deputy Governor of Sokoto State on the Great Nigeria People's Party (GNPP) platform. He was GNPP Secretary for Sokoto State until December 1983, when the military resumed power under Muhammadu Buhari and banned party politics. Mohammed worked for a private company, then was appointed first Assistant General Manager and then General Manager of the Rima River Basin and Rural Development Authority, a Federal Ministry of Water Resources agency. General Ibrahim Babangida appointed Haliru Mohammed as Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service in 1988. He was the first Comptroller General of the Customs and Excise department, then a service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, under a new decentralized arrangement that began on 16 February 1988. He held this post until 1994, when General Sani Abacha replaced him by Brigadier General S. O. G. Ango. During the 1995-98 transition program, Mohammed was a founding member of the Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN). After the death of Abacha, Mohammed was one of the founders of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State. In September 1999 President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Mohammed as a Commissioner on the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission. Minister of Communications Mohammed became the minister of Communications in June 2001 in a minor reshuffle of the cabinet of President Olusegun Obasanjo, replacing Mohammed Arzika. He was appointed at a time when the government was planning to privatise Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL). In December 2001, Mohammed said that the regulator had been mistaken in revalidating the analog mobile licence granted to MTS First Mobile, which could interfere with plans for the nation's GSM network. He said the government was instead encouraging MTS to go into fixed and rural telephony. In September 2002 Mohammed announced that 400,000 lines were being installed to expend NITEL's GSM network in the North-west zone. In May 2003 Mohammed approved revised regulations for interconnection between telephone companies designed to foster competition. Mohammed left office in May 2003. =Subsequent bribery scandals= In 2007 a German court named several prominent Nigerians, including Mohammed, in a bribery scandal involving communications firm Siemens AG. Mohammed was alleged to have collected ‚Ç¨70,000 in two installments, a charge that he denied. In total, the court found that Siemens had paid out ‚Ç¨12 million in bribes to obtain contracts in Nigeria and other countries, and fined the company ‚Ç¨201 million. In November 2007 the German authorities provided fresh information on the Siemens bribery scandal. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) launched an investigation. President Umaru Yar'Adua said of the case \\"... there will neither be sacred cows nor a cover up for anybody found culpable of breaching the law\\". In January 2010 another scandal emerged over a N5 billion contract for supply of equipment to (M-tel), a subsidiary of NITEL. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) launched an investigation. In 2002 Mohammed had looked into complaints by Ericsson over the conduct of Motorola in trying to win a contract, and on the basis of his findings, the contract was awarded to Ericsson. Mohammed was not accused of wrongdoing in this case. Later career =PDP leader= In June 2004 Mohammed was elected as PDP National Vice Chairman for the North West Zone, which consisted of the states of Kaduna, Katsina, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto, Jigawa and Zamfara.< In March 2008 Mohammed became Deputy National Chairman of the PDP. In August 2008, Mohammed received the Diamond Nigerian Telecoms Award at a ceremony in Lagos. In January 2011 he was appointed Acting National Chairman of the PDP after Okwesilieze Nwodo was suspended by the Enugu High Court. Mohammed supported a change to the PDP's zoning system so that President Goodluck Jonathan could run for reelection in 2011, rather than making a northerner the party's candidate. =Minister of Defense= Mohammed was Minister of Defense under President Goodluck Jonathan between 2011 and 2012. He was removed on 22 June 2012 during a period of escalating security problems in the north including bomb attacks by Boko Haram extremists. =Acting Chairman of the PDP= Following the resignation of PDP Board of Trustees (BOT) Chairman, Anthony Anenih, the BOT appointed Haliru Mohammed as its Acting Chairman. Mohammed‚Äôs nomination was endorsed on 25 May 2015 by the BOT at a meeting at the Aso Rock presidential villa in Abuja. The decision was unexpected, as Anenih had said he was resigning so that Jonathan could take the post. On 10 February 2016, Bello was relieved of his duty after it was revealed that he was being prosecuted in connection with the alleged diversion of arms procurement funds. =Controversy= The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has already filed charges against him for their alleged role in the diversion of funds meant for the procurement of arms in the office of the National Security Adviser.

His research focused on the Sun, and for that purpose he initiated construction of several solar telescopes and founded the Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics. Life and work Kiepenheuer was born in 1910 in Weimar, Germany, as a son of the publisher Gustav Kiepenheuer. After the divorce of his parents in 1923 he stayed with his mother. In 1929, he began his studies of physics, astronomy and mathematics at the Berlin Institute of Technology and the University of Berlin. He spent one semester in Paris where he visited the Meudon observatory. He later worked at the G√∂ttingen Observatory where he tried to develop a method to measure the UV radiation of the Sun. After an unsuccessful attempt at Jungfraujoch, he realized that the elevation of 3,454 meters was insufficient for this measurement. The balloon- borne instruments of Erich Regener proved to be more useful and Regener was able to measure the UV radiation of the Sun at a height of more than 30 km. Kiepenheuer also improved aerial cameras and tested them during World War II in high-altitude flights over the United Kingdom. Until the end of the war, Kiepenheuer worked under the supervision of Johannes Plendl. The effect of solar activity on shortwave communication stimulated the observations of the Sun. For this purpose, Kiepenheuer built a network of solar observatories and also used the already existing observatories in the occupied areas of Europe. By 1942, this network spanned from Simeiz in the Crimea in the east to Paris in the west, and from Troms√∂, Norway in the north to Syracuse, Sicily in the south. After the war, Kiepenheuer benefited from his close connections with researchers all over Europe and managed to slowly establish a scientific network for solar observations. Together with the solar telescopes at the Schauinsland, Kiepenheuer established the Fraunhofer Institute near Freiburg in 1943. He was able to keep the solar telescopes in Schauinsland after the Second World War. In 1954, he opened a new solar telescope on the Italian island of Capri. The Fraunhofer Institute was named after the physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer and had no connection to the later institutes of the Fraunhofer Society, which were independently named after the same person. Kiepenheuer served as the head of his Institute until his death in 1975. He helped to establish collaboration between several European countries in building a European solar observatory. He was also active in the development of new telescopes. After his death, a new telescope was built on the Spanish island of Tenerife, and therefore, the outdated observatory at Capri was closed in 1988.

This culture was developed in the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate cultural periods of Peru, from about CE 500 to 1000. Culturally the Pocras were outstanding in pottery, especially that found in Conchopata, Akuchimay, and behind Los Caballitos on the banks of Pi√±awa, Tener√≠a or contemporary Alameda. History = Origin =  Ethnolinguistics origin  With no accurate data on the origin of the Pocras, the study of ethnolinguistics has deduced a history based on the fact that the dominant language family of the Pocras language was Proto-Aymara or \\"Ara\\". All the regional languages of coastal origin are accepted as \\"Aka\\" and those of Andean (sierra) origin as \\"Ara\\". Given that the Pocras linguistic origin is \\"Ara\\" (Aymara), it is accepted that the Pocras are of mountain origin.\\"Aka\\", or Arawak languages, originates in the coastal region, and its current version is called by the name \\"Akaru\\" in the Peruvian department of Lima.  Distribution  The Pocras were inseparable allies of the Hanan Chancas ethnic group.There have been several examples of this union (Pocra- Chanca) in documents of the 16th Century. Data on the origin of the Hanan Chancas, or Kingdom of Parkos, shows the entire ethnic population lived in family groups (Aymara: ayllus) along the Ankoyagu River (currently called the Mantaro River) giving the ayllus the name of Ankuyaku or \\"Anko ayllus\\". In their heyday the Pocras (also called the Pacora) extended into Peru's north coast and settled in the valleys of Jayanca and Pacora (currently Lambayeque). After losing the war with the Quechuas of Cusco, some elite groups of the Pocras fled to the jungle of northeastern Peru where they built several centers, especially in cities of Lamas and Tarapoto in the San Mart√≠n Region of Peru.  Two ethnic groups  It is necessary to distinguish the two ethnic groups of the Chancas that were noted by the Spanish chroniclers, particularly Juan de Betanzos. The Uran Chankas of Andahuaylas, who are not ethnically linked with Parkos, were \\"underlings\\" or servants of the Hanan Chankas of Parkos. The Uran Chankas on the other hand surrendered peacefully to the Incan conquest. There was no term \\"Pocra-Chanca Confederation\\" at the time, as the Pocras were not only allied with the Hanan Chancas, but also the Wankas and the Ankaras who carried out attacks on the city of Cuzco ‚Äî with the participation of the \\"Aukas\\" (sinchis), a warrior strain of Pocras in the city. = Inclusion in the Inca Empire = The Inca Empire, in the military campaign of the Incan ruler Pachac√∫tec (Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui), once defeated the Pocra-Chanca army in the territory adjacent to Cusco, after taking the neighboring chiefdoms into submission thus strengthening the empire. Then he tried to annex the surrounding country with the Chancas as well as the Soras, the Rucanas, and the Pocras. Pachacutec left the city of Cusco in the hands of his brother Lloque Yupanqui while on the campaign against the Soras. The campaign left the area of the Soras split into three armies. One of which was commanded by Apo Conde Mayta circled the Pocras in Vilcas and reached Parkos, located northwest of the current city of Ayacucho, Peru. Once in Parkos, the Incas took into submission the Vilcos, the Morochucos, the Pocras, and the Iquichanos. The conquest of the Pocras region was bloody, but the Incas kept a small Pocras entity with an administrator named Simi Auka that lasted until the Spanish colonial era. After subjecting the Rucanas (now the Lucanas), Pachac√∫tec directed his attention to Pacora, the place of refuge of the Pocras and the Soras. As the resistance was lengthy, he tried to lure them with prizes and privileges, but they mocked the messengers by shooting rocks at them with slingshots. Then Pachacutec sought to control them by creating food and water shortages, and in time the Pocras and the Soras had to surrender, promising to pay tribute and acknowledge allegiance to the lord of Cusco ‚Äî promises that would not be fulfilled due to various rebellions of the Pocras. Since then, the Incans formed the provinces of Parkos whose administrative center was Paukaray (former seat of Hanan Chancas), Guamanka (Pacora Quimpo) whose center was Guaman Qocha (currently Quinua or Quimpo), Ankaras, Chukrupus, and Rukanas whose administrative center was Vilcashuam√°n. Since it was such a vast territory, the colony was divided into Lucanas, which had no capital (much later the capitol was San Juan de Lucanas), and Vilcashuam√°n with the same capital that exist to this day.

The Frucht graph. In 1908, Frucht's family moved from Br√ºnn, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), where he was born, to Berlin. Frucht entered the University of Berlin in 1924 with an interest in differential geometry, but switched to group theory under the influence of his doctoral advisor, Issai Schur; he received his Ph.D. in 1931... Unable to find academic employment in Germany due to his Jewish descent, he became an actuary in Trieste, but left Italy in 1938 because of the racial laws that came into effect at that time. He moved to Argentina, where relatives of his wife lived, and attempted to move from there to the United States, but his employment outside academia prevented him from obtaining the necessary visa.. At the same time Robert Breusch, another German mathematician who had been working in Chile for three years but was leaving for the U.S., invited Frucht to fill his position at Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University in Valparaiso, Chile, where Frucht found an academic home beginning in 1939.. At Santa Mar√≠a, Frucht became dean of the faculty of mathematics and physics from 1948 to 1968, and retired to become an emeritus professor in 1970. Frucht is known for Frucht's theorem, the result that every group can be realized as the group of symmetries of an undirected graph,.. and for the Frucht graph, one of the five smallest cubic graphs without any nontrivial symmetries. LCF notation, a method for describing cubic Hamiltonian graphs, was named for the initials of Joshua Lederberg, H. S. M. Coxeter, and Frucht, its key developers.. Frucht was elected to the Chilean Academy of Sciences as a corresponding member in 1979.

Abandonment costs traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing oil or gas well. In that context, it means the removal of equipment, plugging of the well with cement, any environmental clean-up, etc. necessary to shut the well down. It is occasionally referred to as \\"Removal and Abandonment\\" or R & A. The objective of well abandonment is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere. The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5,000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000. Wells that have been used as injectors or have been subject to fracking operation are more likely to develop leaks because the injected substances can create channels that permit uncontrolled flow outside the casing. The term's application has been broadened from its original context to apply to the abandonment of other business ventures, primarily in manufacturing. It is often used in a cost-benefit analysis to determine if a marginal venture should be continued or if it is more financially beneficial to abandon the venture and plow the remaining money into something else in an attempt to recoup the losses. For example, General Motors had some abandonment costs from shutting down the Pontiac and Saturn brands. The existence of abandonment costs in an industry implies that there is no free exit from that industry.

He was Sar- Subedar (governor) of Kalyan and the Northern Konkan during the reigns of Peshwas Baji Rao I and Balaji Baji Rao. He faithfully served the Peshwas in subduing the rebellion of Damaji Gaikwad in March 1751. The Destruction of Maratha Naval Power Biwalkar's major historical role is in the conflict between the Peshwas and Tulaji Angre, a son of the great Maratha Koli admiral Kanhoji Angre. The first Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath had pacified the Angres in 1713, getting Kanhoji to recognize the supremacy of the Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu. Through the reigns of Baji Rao I and Balaji Baji Rao, the Angres had carved out a semi-autonomous fiefdom, nominally subordinate to the Maratha kingdom. After the death of Kanhoji Angre, his sons continually feuded with each other. Kolaba Fort was controlled by Manaji Angre. Sambhaji Angre retained the fortresses of Suvarnadurg and Vijayadurg and was succeeded by his half-brother Tulaji. Tulaji was ambitious and capable and did not wish to be subordinate to the Peshwa. He plundered the ships of all nations and began to levy contributions from the Peshwa's own territories. Tulaji styled Balaji Vishwanath as an usurper, and intrigued with the Kolhapur Bhonsle rulers, Tarabai and Rajaram II of Satara. In the words of Kincaid & Parasnis: :To Ramaji Mahadev Biwalkar the turbulence of Tulaji Angre was particularly obnoxious...It was Ramaji Mahadev's duty to collect the Angre tribute, but, so far from paying it, Angre cut off the noses of the unfortunate men sent to collect it. He followed up this insolence by storming the fort of Ratnagiri, held by Amatya Bawadekar in the Peshwa's interest. To punish the searover was impossible, so long as he held the great forts of Suvarnadurg and Vijayadurg ; so, with a skill sharpened by hatred, Ramaji Mahadev strove to unite in a league against Tulaji, his brother Manaji Angre, the English and the Peshwa. The alliance of the English and of Manaji was easily obtained. But the Peshwa was for long reluctant to call in foreign aid against a Maratha subject. At last Tulaji's excesses and Ramaji's instances won Balaji over. On the 19th March, 1755, a treaty was signed by the English and the Marathas. : :...The English were to command the allied fleets. Their reward was to be the forts of Bankot and Himmatgad together with five villages and also half the ships captured by the allies. The remaining forts, with their treasures and armament, were to become the property of the Peshwa. :...On the 2nd April the allied fleet reached Suvarnadurg. Eighty miles south of Bombay, Suvarnadurg stood on a low irregular island about a quarter of a mile from the shore. The fortifications were built out of the solid rock and the channel was protected by three forts named Goa, Fatehdurg, and Connoidurg. On the 2nd and 3rd April, Commodore James bombarded Angre's fortresses without result. On the 4th April the outer strongholds struck their colours. Only Suvarnadurg remained. But for months past Ramaji Mahadev had been corrupting its garrison. Thus, when a landing party from the ships disembarked to carry it by storm, they met with little or no resistance. : :On the fall of the outer forts, Tulaji had fled to Vijayadurg, where he remained in safety until the following year. The approach of the monsoon made Commodore James anxious to return to Bombay, which he did on the 17th May. Ramaji Mahadev, reinforced by a strong body of troops under Shamsher Bahadur, the son of Bajirao and Mastani, took all Tulaji's lands in the neighbourhood of the conquered fortress. Another detachment under Khandoji Mankar drove Tulaji's soldiers from the villages near Vijayadurg. The attack on Vijayadurg itself was postponed until the next dry season... :Clive was the senior military officer and took command of the troops. On the 7th February, 1756, the fleet sailed from Bombay. Khandoji Mankar's force had been camped round Vijayadurg since the previous November and was engaged with Tulaji Angre in negotiations for its surrender. On seeing the great strength of the English armada, Tulaji fled in terror from the doomed stronghold and took shelter in Khandoji Mankar's lines. Neither Khandoji Mankar nor Ramaji Mahadev wished any longer to storm Vijayadurg, since Tulaji was in their power and could be forced to surrender it at any moment. But the English commanders resented the separate negotiations of the Marathas, and on the 12th April, 1756, their attack began. By 6-36 p.m. Angre's entire fleet had been destroyed and the English colours flew over Vijayadurg. Tulaji spent the rest of his life in captivity, first in Chandan Wandan fort near Satara and afterwards at Sholapur. The Peshwa annexed his lands. . Buildings Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar's built several temples and other civic buildings. His mansion in Kalyan (Subedarwada) survived into the 20th century. In 1765 he built an irrigation tank, Pokhran that still survives. Situated at Parnaka Kalyan West it is spread over an area of 20,000 sq ft and is 70 ft deep. His house in Thane was the district judge's office during the British administration. In Thane he repaired the temple of Koupineshwar, which was built in Shilahara era. His most famous relic is the temple of Varadavinayak at Mahad. Varadavinayak In 1725 he built (or restored) the Varadavinayak temple in Mahad. Today this is regarded as one of the Ashtavinayak, the 8 major Ganesh temples of Maharashtra. The temple is located three kilometers off the Pune- Mumbai highway near Khopoli. Ganeshotsav Biwalkar built a large mansion known as the Subedarwada in Kalyan. During the freedom struggle in 1906 Bal Gangadhar Tilak visited Kalyan and stayed at the mansion. Tilak revived and popularized the annual Ganesh festival through public celebrations (Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav) in order to bring people closer and awaken them towards the cause of freedom struggle. While the Subedarwada is no longer in existence, the annual Ganesh Utsav celebrations continue. A school was founded in 1896 at the side of the Subedarwada. The descendants of Ramji Mahadev continue to live in a rented house nearby.

The flight may have been involved in illegal smuggling and Islamic militant operations, as Ariana Afghan Airlines was back then controlled by the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regime. Accident The flight departed the city of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates to Kabul on an unscheduled flight with a stop in Kandahar, Afghanistan. While descending for Kabul International Airport, the flight struck the Sharki Baratayi Mountain at an altitude of at 13:00 local time. The crash killed all 10 crew members and 35 passengers. The weather at the time of the accident was poor with snow and rain as well as poor visibility. Aircraft The flight was operated by a Boeing 727-228, registered YA-FAZ. The aircraft first flew on 22 January 1981, meaning at the time of the accident, it was 17.2 years old. Aftermath During rescue operations, Taliban regime members and Ariana officials reportedly carried 32 bodybags and another 15 bags with body parts from mountain. Rescue work was delayed by bad weather and from the aircraft's wreckage being on fire until 03:00 (local time) of the next day. The rescue attempt was difficulted by landmines planted in the area during the 1979-89 Soviet invasion. An Ariana official said on March 20 that the plane was carrying 32 passengers and 13 crew members.20 March 1998 Sharki Baratayi, Afghanistan https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/dpm.1999.07308aac.009/full/html Even if the aircraft's black boxes were reportedly searched for, there is no trace of either a report or an investigation to either determine the causes of the accident or the fate of the black boxes (possibly a consequence of the Taliban regime's international isolation). The director-general of Ariana Afghan Airlines, Hassan Jan, said that the crash was a consequence of bad weather.ibid The crash was one of several incidents that would lead to Ariana Airlines being prohibited from EU airspace. =Taliban and Al-Qaeda operations= According to a November 2001 Los Angeles Times story, this flight may have been one of several involved in a series of smuggling runs carrying arms, money, drugs and Islamic militants between Sharjah, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Passengers in these flights reportedly included militants from both the Al-Qaeda and Taliban movements, the latter of which ruled most of Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, while also harboring Osama bin Laden. Being the regime that controlled most of Ariana's fleet and assets, as well as the airports in Kandahar and Kabul, the Taliban facilitated the flights, helping to provide fake crew and employee IDs to the militants. According to the LA Times report, the pilots of this particular flight may have been Taliban themselves. The story reports on an August 1996 incident, in which Ahmad Shah Massoud's militia stopped an Ariana 727 that was about to depart from Jalalabad Airport full of opium hidden in a fake timber cargo. US intelligence officials were reportedly aware of these flights and the use that the Taliban regime was giving to Ariana Afghan.

If a patient is unable to make decisions for themselves about personal care, some agent must make decisions for them. If there is a durable power of attorney for health care, the agent appointed by that document is authorized to make health care decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If people have court-appointed guardians with authority to make health care decisions, the guardian is the authorized surrogate. Background At the 1991 Annual Meeting of the American Medical Association, the AMA adopted the report of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs known as, \\"Decisions to Forgo Life-Sustaining Treatment for Incompetent Patients.\\" The recommendations of the report were the basis for amendments to Opinion 2.20 known as, \\"Withholding or Withdrawing Life- Sustaining Medical Treatment.\\" The report itself provides guidelines for physicians who may have to identify a surrogate decision maker, assist a surrogate (proxy) in making decisions for incompetent patients, and resolve conflicts that may arise between decision makers, or between the decision maker's choice and medically appropriate options. Since the first incorporation of these guidelines to the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, the council has deferred to Opinion 2.20 to address inquiries involving surrogate decision making, even though the guidelines presented in this Opinion refer only to decisions made near the end of life. With continued discussion concerning health care preferences for all patients, including those who are incompetent, greater options have been made available to secure health care directives. The involvement of third parties in a patient's health becomes more likely in decisions that may occur in instances other than the end of life. In addition, the council recognizes that there is a spectrum of decision-making capacity ranging from immaturity, to mental illness, to serious brain damage, and that health care decisions often must be made for individuals with diminished decisional faculties over extended periods of time. The council offers the following report to expand on its previous guidelines and to identify features related to a meaningful and effective physician-proxy relationship. The report begins by defining a number of terms related to health care directives before presenting theoretical frameworks used in making decisions for incompetent patients. It then provides a protocol for identifying a surrogate decision maker as well as guidance for physicians who may run into conflict either assisting the surrogate in coming to a decision or with the decision itself. Finally, the report offers guidelines for nurturing an effective physician-proxy relationship. A study was conducted aiming to describe physicians' experiences with surrogate communication and decision making for hospitalized adults. It was concluded that physician- surrogate decision making may be enhanced if patients discuss their preferences in advance and if physician contact with surrogate decision makers is facilitated. A further study by the same group of researchers was conducted exploring the degree to which physicians report reliance on patient preferences when making medical decisions for hospitalized patients lacking decisional capacity. Although a majority of physicians identified patient preferences as the most important general ethical guideline for surrogate decision-making, they relied on a variety of factors when making treatment decisions for a patient lacking decisional capacity. Designating a surrogate decision maker The Patient Self-Determination Act guarantees a patient's right to formally designate a surrogate to make treatment decisions for the patient if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions. A surrogate decision-maker, or durable power of attorney for health care (DPA/HC), must be documented. A common form that is valid in 40 states is Five Wishes. When filing an advance directive, an alternate health care agent should be identified. The surrogate decision maker must be a trusted individual that is able to make crucial decisions on behalf of the advance directive client. The advance directive should also indicate specific instructions for when a patient is incapacitated. Treatment options should be examined and discussed with a physician, attorney, and family members. Common instructions might include instruction surrounding the use of a feeding tube. The client's inclinations must be clearly written, and the health care agent should fully understand the instructions given as well as how to execute them. When drafting a health care proxy, it is best to consult a physician and attorney. The forms are available through lawyers, hospitals, and websites dedicated to health care ethics. The proxy must identify the client and the client's agent, also including all contact information. The advance directive must state that the designated agent has authority to make health care decisions on the patient's behalf and what limitations, if any, are imposed on the agent's authority. The document should clearly state that the agent's authority begins only when the patent is unable to make health care decisions. When the document is finished, it must be signed and have been witnessed by two individuals who are not the agents, caregivers, or relatives to the patient. The completed document should be signed by the witnesses and the client of the advance directive. The document should be given to the patent's physician, lawyer, spouse/partner, and family. The advance directive should be reviewed regularly and reflect changes in the client's current marital situation (e.g. marriage or divorce). For the agent to view the medical records of the client, the client should sign a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) release form. Criteria for being a surrogate agent In the event that a surrogate decision maker has not been identified through either a medical power of attorney or a court-appointed legal guardian, such an agent is selected by medical personnel. A patient must meet a certain set of criteria prior to the legal selection of a health care surrogate agent. The patient must have a disabling condition such as a mental illness or infirmity, an impairment in the ability to complete activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and a lack of any previously indicated alternative to guardianship. This person is chosen by either the attending physician or their advance practice nurse. In the US, hierarchy of health care surrogates may vary according to the law of the specific state, but an example order of priority is listed here: #The client's guardian #The client's spouse #Any adult son or daughter of the client #Either parent of the client #Any adult brother or sister of the client #Any adult grandchild of the client, or an adult relative who has exhibited special care and concern, who has maintained close contact, and who is familiar with the patient's activities, health, and religious or moral beliefs #A close friend of the client #The client's guardian of the estate When there are multiple candidates at the same level of priority in the hierarchal structure, it becomes their duty to reach an agreement in regard to decisions and care of the patient. If such surrogate agents are unable to develop a consensus, the physician looks to the majority of agents in that category.Illinois General Assembly If an agent of greater hierarchy becomes available than the current identified agent, the person of higher precedence has priority. If any agent becomes unavailable, the physician returns to the hierarchal structure to indicate the next candidate. A prime example of this would be Nancy Cruzan. This case has helped to establish some principles of surrogacy, such as using the person who best knows the patient rather than just the next of kin. =Controversial agents= Any health care surrogate agent is granted the same rights in regard to access of medical information and decision-making as would the alert and competent patient. These rights remain until such time as the client regains decisional capacity, a guardian is appointed, or the patient's death occurs. All health care surrogates are expected to follow the same set of standards: patient's known wishes, substituted judgments, and patient's best interests. The following people are denied the ability to act as a health care surrogate: # The client's treating health care provider # An employee of the treating health care provider, unless that employee is a relation of the patient # Owner, operator, or administrator of the patient's current health care facility # An employee of an owner, operator, or administrator of the patient's current health care facility, unless that employee is a relation of the patient Powers and limitations of a surrogate A surrogate decision- maker must use the doctrine of substituted judgment in consenting to or refusing health care on behalf of an incompetent individual. All surrogates, whether appointed by the person, by default, or by the court, have an obligation to follow the expressed wishes of the adult person and to act in the person's best interests, taking into account the person's values if known. If no advance directives are available, the proxy should use the principle of substituted judgment by considering what the patient would want in the given situation. This may require further discussion with others who knew the patient prior to the current period of incapacity. Occasionally, there is simply no information available about this patient's wishes and a \\"reasonable person\\" or best interest standard is applied by the hospital care team. This standard is used when the patient's values are unknown. The best interest's standard is the least preferred standard because surrogates use their own values to decide what is in the patient's best interests‚Äîwhich places a heavy burden on the surrogate. The agent should not be given the power to make decisions against the patient's will, and does not take away the right to make decisions from the patient. This is no longer effective when the agent knows that the patient has died. Conflicts of interest A conflict of interest occurs when an individual or organization is involved in multiple interests, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation for an act in the other. For example, a woman marries a wealthy man. In his final will, the man wants to leave his multi-million dollar estate to his wife. Soon after this occurs, the man becomes ill and falls into an unconscious persistent vegetative state. The wife believes that the care team should take her husband off life support and allow him to die. In this situation, the care team would have to take into account that a conflict of interest could be present. There are other examples of cases following the links listed below. =Best interests standard= The best interest standard is defined as the best possible outcome for patient in a given situation, the outcome that provides the most benefit to the patient. The values of the client must be taken into account. Religion, any beliefs related to life and death. What are the patient's best interests? Some best interests in order of their standards include life at any cost, freedom from pain, rationality, and dignity. It is all in what the patient chooses to be of utmost importance to them. Laws related to surrogacy in the US To decide for themselves, the patient must be competent to decide. This means that the patient must be conscious and able to choose the option they feel is best for their health and well-being. This must be fulfilled first under any circumstance. However, there are some exceptions. Some states have passed laws allowing incompetent patients with certified mental illness to speak for themselves regarding decision-making. =Current status of the law= Adults that are considered competent have the right to refuse treatment. As stated above, some states allow incompetent adults to refuse treatment. There can also be recommended termination of medical treatment for incompetent adults by a physician. Two tests for competency are the substituted judgment test and the best interests test. Current statutory solutions include living wills or advance directives that explain the patient's wishes in certain medical situations. A durable power of attorney for health care (DPA/HC) and is another way of identifying a patient's final wishes through an attorney. The patient self-determination act states that hospitals and health care facilities must provide information about advance directives and DPA/HC. Also, a proxy or surrogate decision-maker can provide these final wishes to the doctor or care team if a DPA/HC or AD is not present. Some fictional assumptions underlying judicial decisions include the following misconceptions: 1\\\\. It is better to make a mistake in favor of preserving the patient's life. This is an all too common misconception about surrogate decision-making, and another reason why it is so important to have a DPA/HC or AD. In most cases, patients wish to have a death free from pain, and wish to be only provided with comfort care during the remaining hours of their life. 2\\\\. The state has an interest in preserving life. Although euthanasia is illegal in the US, Physician assisted suicide has been passed in some states. 3\\\\. Most people want to be kept \\"alive\\" by machines. Most people don't want to drain their family's funds to keep them alive especially when they are in a persistent vegetative state with no possible chance for recovery. In these cases, it is often weighing the risks and benefits of keeping the patient breathing, when they are clearly not living their life to its full potential. 4\\\\. There is no harm in postponing the decision. Often postponing the decision to keep a person on life support drains resources and funds. 5\\\\. Youth withdraw medical treatment from the elderly. Usually the next of kin to the elderly are younger, and know what the best interests of the elderly are and have discussed. Although at times it is difficult to explain the wishes of the patient to the physician or care team when the proxy disagrees with the patient they are representing. 6\\\\. The family may terminate medical treatment for financial reasons. It is difficult for a family member to see another family member suffer from illness or in pain, which is often why family members refrain from life support or a feeding tube. 7\\\\. Removal of life- sustaining treatment is a step toward euthanasia. Euthanasia and sustaining from treatment are completely different aspects of death. Euthanasia is usually taking an active approach to the death of a patient while removing treatment simply allows the patient to die from their illness while providing them comfort care. 8\\\\. The religious oppose termination of life-sustaining treatment. Freedom from pain and comfort care is most often the humane way and accepted by most all religions.

It was discovered on 4 January 1992, by Japanese astronomers Seiji Ueda and Hiroshi Kaneda at the Kushiro Observatory on Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. The S-type asteroid has a short rotation period of 2.5 hours. Its sub-kilometer satellite was discovered in 1997. As of 2018, the binary system has not been named.  Orbit and classification  ' a member of the Mars-crossing asteroids, a dynamically unstable group between the main belt and the near- Earth populations, crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.66 AU. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.3‚Äì2.3 AU once every 2 years and 6 months (910 days; semi-major axis of 1.84 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid makes occasional close approaches to Mars. Its next close approach, on 22 January 2027, will bring it from Mars. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in November 1951, or more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kushiro.  Naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 9 December 1992 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.  Physical characteristics  ' has been characterized as a common, stony S-type asteroid. In the SMASS taxonomy, it is an Sk-subtype, that transitions between the S and K-type asteroids. The body's color indices of 0.690 (B‚ÄìV), 0.500 (V‚ÄìR) and 0.840 (V‚ÄìI) were also determined. = Lightcurves =  Rotation period  Since 1997, several rotational lightcurves of ' have been obtained from photometric observations by Petr Pravec and collaborating astronomers. Best-rated lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 2.5488 hours with a consolidated brightness amplitude between 0.10 and 0.12 magnitude (). The results supersedes a tentative period determination of 3.6 hours by Marc Buie ().  Satellite  During the observations in January 1997, it was also revealed that ' is a synchronous binary asteroid with a minor-planet moon in its orbit. The satellite measures approximately 780 meters in diameter, or about 20% of its primary, and has an orbital period of 13.52 hours with an estimated semi-major axis of 5.8 kilometers for its very circular orbit. Observations by Pravec in January and February 2012 confirmed the binary nature of this asteroid, as well as its rotational and orbital periods. The satellite's provisional designation is S/1997 (5407) 1. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Spitzer Space Telescope and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), ' measures between 2.78 and 4.18 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.199 and 0.40. In 2017, a study by WISE dedicated to Mars-crossing asteroids determined a diameter of 3.60 kilometers with a high albedo of 0.376. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 3.79 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.47.

He played Major League Baseball from 1962 to 1966 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and Atlanta Braves. He also played college baseball and football at the University of Michigan from 1956 to 1959. He was the captain of the 1958 Michigan Wolverines football team and the third generation of the Herrnstein family to play for a Michigan Wolverines football team. His father, William Herrnstein, Jr., played for the Wolverines from 1923 to 1925, and his grandfather, William Herrnstein, Sr., played for the team in the 1898 and 1900 seasons. His great uncle Albert E. Herrnstein played for Fielding H. Yost's famed \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams in 1901 and 1902. University of Michigan Herrnstein attended the University of Michigan where he was a star athlete in both baseball and football. In football, he played fullback on offense and linebacker on defense from 1956 to 1958. As a sophomore, he rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown in his third game against Army and scored three touchdowns in his fourth game against Northwestern. He was the starting fullback on the 1956 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished with a 7‚Äì2 record and a #7 ranking in both the Associated Press and United Press International polls. He rushed for 475 net yards on 123 carries, scored seven touchdowns and tied with Terry Barr as Michigan's leading scorer in 1956.(Enter \\"herrnstein\\" in the \\"Enter last name\\" box to retrieve career statistics) In a preview of the 1957 season, The Sporting News called Herrnstein \\"Michigan's Big Gun\\" and a \\"pounding fullback.\\" During the 1957 football season, an injury to his left foot slowed Herrnstein. He had played 442 minutes as a sophomore, but was limited to 179 minutes in 1957. In December 1957, he was elected by his teammates as the captain of the 1958 Michigan Wolverines football team. In the 1958 season opener, Herrnstein rushed for a career-high 144 yards and scored two touchdowns against the USC Trojans. However, in the second game, he sustained a hand injury in the first quarter and was sidelined for the rest of the game. In the first quarter of the season's third game, a 20‚Äì14 loss to Navy, Herrnstein injured his left knee. He later recounted the play: \\"I was the linebacker and a Navy blocker hit me from nowhere. That was the third game of the year, but the last one for me. The ligaments in my knee were torn up pretty bad.\\" The knee injury sidelined Herrnstein for the remainder of the 1958 season and ended his football career. In baseball, Herrnstein played for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1957 and 1958. He batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Michigan baseball coach Ray Fisher called him the Wolverines' best baseball player since Dick Wakefield in the early 1940s. Professional baseball =Signing with the Phillies= Herrnstein scoring a touchdown against USC, September 1958 Herrnstein had been a highly touted baseball prospect prior to his knee surgery in 1958. He had turned down offers from major league teams in order to attend college. While the knee surgery reduced the interest in Herrnstein among some clubs, the Philadelphia Phillies remained interested and signed him to a contract on December 2, 1958, in exchange for a bonus of $35,000. Herrnstein signed with the Phillies while still a student at Michigan and while recuperating from the knee surgery. He later recalled, \\"They operated on me right away and the Phillies scout came to me and I signed the contract while I was still in the hospital.\\" At the time, Herrnstein said, \\"I'll leave school at the end of the semester in January and plan to return in September to finish up.\\" =Minor leagues= Herrnstein began his professional baseball career in 1959 for the Des Moines Demons in the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League. He appeared in 105 games, compiling a .244 batting average with 21 doubles, three triples and 10 RBIs, as he helped lead the team to a 78-48 record. Herrnstein later recalled that he was disappointed with his offensive performance at Des Moines: \\"That first year I didn't think I'd ever hit.\\" He was promoted to the Eastern League in 1960, where he became a key player for the Williamsport Grays as the team won the 1960 league pennant. Herrnstein hit .305 with 16 home runs, six triples, 11 stolen bases, and 85 RBIs. Following his strong showing at Williamsport, Herrnstein played in 1961 for the Chattanooga Lookouts in the Southern Association. He appeared in 159 games for the Lookouts and batted .292 with a .365 on-base percentage, 22 doubles, six triples, 17 home runs, and 95 RBIs. =1962 season= In 1962, Herrnstein played for the Buffalo Bisons in the International League. He appeared in 148 games and compiled a .293 batting average, .356 on-base percentage, 30 doubles, seven triples, 23 RBIs, and six stolen bases. The Sporting News published a feature story on Herrnstein in June in which it noted his ability to hit effectively off left- handed pitchers: > \\"A modern rarity -- a lefthanded batter who rips lefthanded pitching -- is > Buffalo's candidate for rookie of the year. He is Outfielder John > Herrnstein, six feet, four inches and 215 pounds, who runs with a 10.2 > sprinter's speed.\\" Buffalo's manager Kerby Farrell said at the time, \\"At this stage of his career, Herrnstein has more potential than either Roger Maris or Rocky Colavito\\", both of whom Farrell had coached in the minor leagues. In September 1962, he was reacquired by the Phillies from Buffalo. He made his major league debut on September 15, 1962, and over the next two weeks he appeared in eight games for the Phillies, all as a pinch hitter. He had one hit and one RBI in five at-bats. During the winter of 1962, Herrnstein played for Arecibo in the Puerto Rican League. By mid-December, he was leading the league with nine home runs. He ultimately led the Puerto Rican League with 14 home runs. =1963 season= Rumors spread in the spring of 1963 that the Phillies intended to trade Herrnstein to the New York Mets. However, Phillies owner Bob Carpenter quashed the rumors noting, \\"Herrnstein will not be traded. He's going to be playing for the Phillies one day soon.\\" With Wes Covington, Tony Gonz√°lez, and Johnny Callison entrenched in the outfield, the Phillies saw an opportunity for Herrnstein to become their starting first baseman, replacing Roy Sievers. Accordingly, and after a brief stint with the Phillies at the start of the 1963 season, Herrnstein was optioned to the Little Rock Travelers to allow him to try his hand at first base. Herrnstein appeared in 124 games for Little Rock, batting .271 with a .361 on-base percentage, 19 doubles, 22 home runs, and 73 RBIs. Herrnstein appeared in 15 games as a pinch hitter for the Phillies in 1963. In 12 at-bats, he compiled a .167 batting average. On September 23, 1963, he hit his first major league home run off Don Larsen of the San Francisco Giants. Herrnstein was called into the game as a pinch hitter with two out in the ninth inning. The blow, which flew over the right- center field fence at Candlestick Park, gave the Phillies a 5-4 victory. =1964 season= Herrnstein spent the full 1964 season with the Phillies. He got off to a quick start, working his way into the starting lineup after an injury to outfielder Tony Gonz√°lez. On April 19, 1964, he played his first game as a starter and hit a single and a home run. In his next game, he hit a two-run, game-winning double down the left field line off Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher, Roy Face. He followed the next night with two doubles and a triple. By the end of April, he was batting over .400 with an on-base percentage over .500. Herrnstein also began the 1964 season with a solid defensive showing. He initiated a triple play in May on a ground ball from Jerry Grote. Herrnstein fielded the ball, threw to shortstop Bobby Wine for the first out. Wine threw back to Herrnstein for the second out, and Herrnstein threw to catcher Gus Triandos who tagged Rusty Staub attempting to score from second base. Herrnstein appeared in 125 games for the 1964 Phillies team, including 61 as the team's starting first baseman and 15 games as a starter in the outfield. He compiled a .234 batting average in 1964 with 12 doubles, four triples, six home runs, and 25 RBIs. His batting average in 21 at-bats as a pinch hitter was .333. =1965 season= Herrnstein remained with the Phillies throughout the 1965 season, but he saw his playing time reduced to 63 games, only 12 as a starter. Dick Stuart took over as the team's starting first baseman, leaving Herrnstein to be used mostly as a pinch hitter. Herrnstein batted .200 in 85 at-bats with one home run and five RBIs. =1966 season= The 1966 season was Herrnstein's final year in professional baseball. He began the season with a strong showing in spring training for the Phillies. He led the team with four home runs in Grapefruit League games. While Herrnstein had won the opening night assignment in left field, he managed only one hit in his first 10 at- bats to open the regular season. After the slow start, the Phillies dealt Herrnstein to the Chicago Cubs on April 21. Traded along with him was 23-year- old Ferguson Jenkins ‚Äî later to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame ‚Äî but then a prospect who had (to that point) only appeared in eight big league games. Herrnstein appeared in only nine games for the Cubs, compiling a .176 batting average in 17 at-bats. Only one month later (in late May), Herrnstein was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for first baseman Marty Keough. He lasted just 17 games with the Braves, batting .222 in 18 at-bats. His last appearance in a major league game occurred on July 7, 1966. The Braves assigned Herrnstein to the Richmond Braves in the International League on July 14. Playing for his fourth team in a span of three months, he compiled a .134 batting average in 82 at-bats for Richmond. In December 1966, Herrnstein was traded by the Braves with Chris Cannizzaro to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Julio Navarro and Ed Rakow. Nonetheless, he did not play professional baseball after the 1966 season. Later years After retiring from baseball, Herrnstein had a career in finance until he retired in 2011. His son, Seth Herrnstein, played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes. John Herrnstein died at his home in Chillicothe, Ohio on October 3, 2017, at the age of 79.

Portrait by John Hamilton Mortimer. The Apostles of Linnaeus were a group of students who carried out botanical and zoological expeditions throughout the world that were either devised or approved by botanist Carl Linnaeus. The expeditions took place during the latter half of the 18th century and the students were designated 'apostles' by Linnaeus.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 173‚Äì174. Many apostles began their journey from Sweden. Some would act as chaplains or doctors aboard a Swedish East India Company ship. The expeditions were often dangerous. Seven of the seventeen apostles never came home. The first apostle, Christopher T√§rnstr√∂m, died of a tropical fever on C√¥n S∆°n Island in 1746. T√§rnstr√∂m's widow was angry with Linnaeus for making her children fatherless. After this incident, Linnaeus sent only unmarried men. Linnaeus remained involved in most expeditions. He often left notes for the apostles and outlined what they should look for during their journeys, and the apostles sent letters and botanical samples to Linnaeus. Upon their return, it was usual to give Linnaeus a selection of anything collected. However, Daniel Rolander elected not to transfer his collection and was criticised by Linnaeus. Many newly discovered plants, animals and insects were named and catalogued by Linnaeus and apostles. As a result, the apostles' expeditions helped spread the Linnaean taxonomy, a system for classifying organisms. Additionally, one of Linnaeus' admirers, the English botanist Joseph Banks, was inspired to begin the tradition for all British research ships to have a naturalist aboard. Thus the apostles had a direct influence on future expeditions such as Charles Darwin's expedition aboard HMS Beagle.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). p. 184.  Origins  Carl Linnaeus Carl Linnaeus was born in R√•shult, Sm√•land, Sweden on 23 May 1707.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). p. 12. Linnaeus enrolled at Uppsala University to study botany and medicine in 1728.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 23‚Äì25. Following his studies, he went to the Netherlands to study medicine.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). p. 94. While in the Netherlands, he published Systema Naturae that describes a new system for classifying plants.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). p. 98. Linnaeus returned to Sweden in May 1741 and was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University. Nine years later he became the university's rector, starting a period where natural sciences were held in the greatest esteem. Perhaps the most important contribution Linnaeus made during his time in Uppsala was as a teacher. His lectures were normally full and often held in the Botanical Garden. He taught students to think for themselves and not trust anybody. The Saturday botanical excursions during summer were more popular than his lectures. Linnaeus and students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala. Additionally, he let some of the best students live with him at his house.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 172‚Äì173. Among Linnaeus' notable students, the most promising and committed ones made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with the help of their professor. These seventeen adventurers were referred to as Linnaeus' apostles.Mary, Gribbin (2008). pp. 56‚Äì57. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a place on an expedition or a scholarship.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 189‚Äì190. Most apostles were given instructions of what to find during their journeys. The apostles collected, organised and classified new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' classification system. Most gave their collections to Linnaeus when their journey finished.Broberg, Gunnar (2006). pp. 37‚Äì39.  The Apostles  = Christopher T√§rnstr√∂m, China (1746) = Christopher T√§rnstr√∂m (1703‚Äì1746) was the first apostle. Linnaeus permitted T√§rnstr√∂m to conduct a botanical expedition in China. In early 1746, T√§rnstr√∂m received free passage on the Swedish East India Company ship Calmar to China. He took a list, written by Linnaeus, of things to collect which included plants, animals and insects. However, Calmar stopped sailing beyond C√¥n S∆°n Island (off the modern-day Vietnamese coast) because it had been forced to find a winter berth.Mary, Gribbin (2008). p. 57. On 4 December 1746, T√§rnstr√∂m died of a tropical fever without a botanical or zoological specimen having been sent to Sweden.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). p. 174. His widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless. Following the death of T√§rnstr√∂m, Linnaeus allowed only unmarried men to become his apostles.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 185‚Äì186. = Pehr Kalm, North America (1747‚Äì1751) = Pehr Kalm TIEDE 5/2003, Suomalaisten l√∂yt√∂retket 3: Professori Kalm p√§√§si amerikan lehtiin. NOTE: While this picture is widely believed to portray Pehr Kalm, some modern- day historians think it may actually depict Kalm's colleague Pehr Gadd. Pehr Kalm (1715‚Äì1779) was born in Sweden to Finnish parents and became a student of Linnaeus in December 1740. He proposed to Linnaeus that he travel to North America on a botanical expedition. Linnaeus concurred and in November 1747 Kalm began his journey to North America sponsored by the universities in Uppsala and √Öbo. After a long stay in England, on the way he reached Philadelphia in autumn 1748. Once there, he stayed in North America for two and a half years, visiting the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and southern Canada. He then returned to Sweden. Kalm is one of the few apostles who actually lived up to Linnaeus' hopes; bringing with him a large collection of pressed plants and seeds. His travel experience was later published in a three-volume book, En resa til Norra America.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). p. 186.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). pp. 58‚Äì62.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). p. 181. = Fredric Hasselquist, Izmir, Egypt etc. (1749‚Äì1752) = Fredric Hasselquist (1722‚Äì1752) heard Linnaeus talking about the botanically unexplored Eastern Mediterranean and he was inspired to travel there. Hasselquist was poor and to make the expedition possible, he relied on sponsorships from Linnaeus and Olof Celsius. On 7 August 1749, Hasselquist sailed from Stockholm to Izmir (a city in Turkey) where he spent the winter. Subsequently, he sailed to Egypt where stayed for ten months before returning. On the way he passed: Syria; Cyprus; Rhodes; and Chios. He returned to Izmir with a rich collection of botanical and zoological findings and also minerals. On 9 February 1752, he died before returning to Sweden. During his expedition he accumulated a large debt and Linnaeus was informed that Hasselquist's collections and manuscripts would not be sent home until the debt was paid. Swedish Queen Louisa Ulrika paid the debt and Linnaeus received Hasselquist's findings. In 1757, Linnaeus published Iter Palaestinium based on Hasselquist's collections and manuscripts.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 186‚Äì187.Fr√§ngsmyr et al. (1983). pp. 54‚Äì55.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). pp. 175‚Äì176. = Olof Tor√©n, Surat and Guangzhou (1750) = Olof Tor√©n (1718‚Äì1753) travelled to Surat and India as a priest with the Swedish East India Company in 1750. He continued to Guangzhou (Canton) and China before returning to Sweden. During his journey, he corresponded with Linnaeus; these letters were published posthumously as an appendix in the travelogue of another apostle, Pehr Osbeck. He fell ill during his journey and died shortly after his return in 1753. He returned with a large collection of specimens.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). p. 53.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). p. 182. = Pehr Osbeck, China (1750‚Äì1752) = Pehr Osbeck Pehr Osbeck (1723‚Äì1805) sailed from G√∂teborg to China in 1750 on ship Prins Carl. His primary task was to collect a tea plant for Linnaeus. He spent four months in Guangzhou where he collected many plants, but not the tea plant. He returned to Sweden in June 1752 with his collection and several other objects which he gave to Linnaeus.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 187‚Äì188.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). pp. 52‚Äì53.Mary, Gribbin (2008). pp. 57‚Äì58. = Pehr L√∂fling, Spain and Venezuela (1751‚Äì1756) = Pehr L√∂fling (1729‚Äì1756) was recommended by Linnaeus when the Spanish ambassador in Stockholm asked for help exploring Spanish flora. L√∂fling travelled to Madrid in 1751 where he stayed for approximately two years. He explored the flora and fauna and regularly sent plants to Linnaeus. In 1754 the Spanish organised an expedition to South America and L√∂fling was invited to join them. They first stopped in the Canary Islands, staying for a short time before continuing to Venezuela. In Venezuela, L√∂fling collected plants with the help of his two assistants. L√∂fling stayed in South America until his death on 22 February 1756 in Guyana.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). pp. 178‚Äì179. = Daniel Rolander, Suriname (1755) = Daniel Rolander (1725‚Äì1793) followed Linnaeus' acquaintance, Carl Gustav Dahlberg, to Suriname in 1755. Although he became ill on the way, he had almost recovered by the time he arrived. In Suriname he tried to explore the rainforests but disliked the climate. He developed an alcohol addiction and his health began to decline. He stayed for seven months and then returned with a collection containing plants and insects. He did not, however, give anything from his collection to Linnaeus. This is reported to have made Linnaeus \\"furious\\". Linnaeus, determined to acquire parts of Rolander's collection, broke into Rolander's home and reportedly stole a Sauvagesia plant. This incident ended the relationship between the two men and Linnaeus was heard to speak ill of Rolander on several occasions.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). pp. 104‚Äì115. = Anton Rolandsson Martin, Spitsbergen (1758) = Anton Rolandsson Martin (1729‚Äì1785) was born in what is now Estonia and later came to Sweden to be taught by Linnaeus. Linnaeus helped Martin get a small grant from Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences to go to Spitsbergen, an island in the Arctic Ocean. In 1758, Martin joined a whaling expedition to the island but was only able to get ashore a few hours. He managed to bring back mosses and lichen. Despite how few samples he was able to bring back, Martin's expedition gained Linnaeus' praise.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). p. 95. = Carl Fredrik Adler, East Indies, China and Java (c. 1761) = Carl Fredrik Adler (1720‚Äì1761) sailed to the East Indies in 1761 on a Swedish East India Company ship. He also visited China and Java on the same expedition. His journey was short. He died later in the year of his departure while still in Java. However, before his death he had succeeded in sending some samples back to Linnaeus from China. = Pehr Forssk√•l, Egypt and Yemen (1761‚Äì1763) = Pehr Forssk√•l Pehr Forssk√•l (1732‚Äì1763) was born in Finland and became a student of Linnaeus when he was 18 years old. Forssk√•l was asked if he wanted to join a Danish expedition, commissioned by the Danish King Frederick V, to the Middle East. He consulted Linnaeus and was given permission to go. Although it was a Danish expedition, King Frederick V stated that the findings would not be placed in Copenhagen until several international botanists, including Linnaeus, had studied them. Forssk√•l and the expedition sailed in the winter of 1761. Their first stop was Alexandria, Egypt. Forssk√•l made many findings at Suez and was one of the first to describe the flora and fauna of the Red Sea. The expedition reached Yemen in April 1763 where Forssk√•l found a Commiphora which Linnaeus was particularity interested in. However, Forssk√•l died of malaria on 11 July 1763 before he could deliver Commiphora to Linnaeus. Forssk√•l worked on Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica and Descriptiones Animalis during the expedition. His works were published posthumously in 1775 by another expedition member. Carsten Niebuhr.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). pp. 176‚Äì177. = G√∂ran Rothman, Tunisia and Libya (1773‚Äì1776) = G√∂ran Rothman (1739‚Äì1778) studied medicine at Uppsala University and carried out his dissertation with Linnaeus as his supervisor. In 1773 Rothman travelled to North Africa that was commissioned by the Swedish Academy of Sciences. He visited Libya and Tunisia but was unable to go as far inland as he wished due to local unrest. He returned to Sweden in 1776 with very few findings.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). p. 94. = Johan Peter Falk, Russia (1768‚Äì1774) = Johan Peter Falk (1732‚Äì1774) arrived in Uppsala University in 1751 and became an apostle. He followed Linnaeus on his expedition to the island province Gotland and later became a tutor to Linnaeus' son, Carl. In 1760, Linnaeus encouraged Falk to follow apostle Forssk√•l on the Danish expedition to Egypt but Falk did not gain approval from the Danes. In 1768, the Russian Academy of Sciences created several expeditions to explore eastern Russia. Thanks to Linnaeus, Falk was given responsibility for one of the expeditions and headed out the same year. The expedition explored many places in Russia, including Volgograd and the steppes. Falk explored and described native customs as well as both flora and fauna. During the journey Falk became addicted to opium and caused him to suffer depression throughout the expedition. In 1774 the expedition reached Kazan where Falk committed suicide. Following his death, his collections and journals were sent to Saint Petersburg to be later completed and published as Beytr√§ga zur topografischen Kenntniss des Russichen Reichs in 1785‚Äì86 by Samuel Georg Gmelin.Fagerstedt and S√∂rlin (2004). pp. 74‚Äì76.St√∂ver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich (1974). pp. 179‚Äì180. = Daniel Solander, Australia etc. (1768‚Äì1771) and Iceland (1772) = Daniel Solander Daniel Solander (1733‚Äì1782) was living in Linnaeus's house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was fond of him, promising Solander his eldest daughter's hand in marriage and telling Solander that he would become his successor. Based on Linnaeus's recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760 where he spread the Linnaean taxonomy. Two years later Linnaeus got Solander a position as professor in botany in Saint Petersburg. Linnaeus was surprised and disappointed when Solander answered that he had decided to stay in England. This damaged their relationship and thereafter Linnaeus was heard to refer to \\"the ungrateful Solander.\\" In 1768 Solander was employed by the English botanist Joseph Banks to follow James Cook on his first journey to the Pacific Ocean aboard the Endeavour. The Endeavour sailed to Australia, Asia, Africa and several other places where Solander and Banks made many natural sciences discoveries. About a year after the expedition, in 1772, Solander and Banks made another botanical journey to Iceland. He never sent anything from his collection home to Linnaeus, but continued to organise his samples according to Linnaeus's system.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 191‚Äì192.Mary, Gribbin (2008). pp. 58‚Äì59. = Anders Sparrman, China (1765‚Äì1767), South Africa (1771‚Äì1772 and 1775) Oceania etc. (1772‚Äì1775) Senegal (1787) = Anders Sparrman Even before he became an apostle, Anders Sparrman (1748‚Äì1820) had made a two-year-long journey to China as a surgeon on a Swedish East India Company ship. In 1771, he sailed to South Africa as one of Linnaeus' apostles where he tutored and explored the flora and fauna. The next year he was asked to join Cook's second expedition on Resolution. On the journey, he visited and studied plants in various locations including Oceania and South America. He returned to South Africa two years later having made many botanical findings. He stayed there for another eight months before returning to Uppsala in 1776. In 1787, he travelled to Senegal on an expedition to find land for colonisation. He published his travel diary Resa till Goda Hopps-Udden, s√∂dra Polkretsen och omkring Jordklotet, samt till Hottentott- och Caffer-Landen √Ören 1772-1776 in three volumes, 1783-1818.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 192‚Äì193. = Carl Peter Thunberg, South Africa, Japan etc. (1770‚Äì1779) = Carl Peter Thunberg Just like Linnaeus, Carl Peter Thunberg (1743‚Äì1828) arrived in Uppsala at the age of 18. Having completed his dissertation in 1770, he travelled to Paris. On the way back to Sweden he met Linnaeus' friend Johannes Burman in Amsterdam. With Burman's influence, Thunberg became a surgeon in the Dutch East India Company. He joined an expedition heading to Japan, which at that time was only open for Dutch ships. The expedition stopped in South Africa in 1772 where it remained for three years. During this time Thunberg found 300 new plant species and sent many of his findings to Linnaeus. In 1775, the expedition continued to Java and then to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the Dejima island, outside Nagasaki, so it was difficult for Thunberg to study the mainland flora. However, he got many translators to bring him some mainland specimens to add to those plants he found in the gardens of Dejima. The only time Thunberg could explore the Japanese landscape was when he visited the sh≈çgun in Edo. After 15 months, he returned to Sweden, passing Sri Lanka on the way. From his findings in Japan, Thunberg published Flora Japonica. From his findings in South Africa, he published Flora Capensis.Blunt, Wilfrid (2004). pp. 193‚Äì194. = Andreas Berlin, Guinea (1773) = Andreas Berlin (1746‚Äì1773) studied in Uppsala University with Linnaeus as his student before travelling to London to find a botanical expedition he could join.

The purpose of the expedition was to explore the central parts of Africa but prior to reaching the mainland, Berlin died of a stomach illness while on the √éles de Los.

This neighbourhood, one of Barcelona's most deprived areas and until very recently made up mostly of cheap public housing has been undergoing some renovation. The station was opened on 18 April 2010 with the opening of the line from this station to Gorg and Can Peixauet, enabling this neighbourhood to be connected with the metro network. It is served by TMB-operated Barcelona Metro lines L9 and L10. Layout The station is located under Sant Adri√† street and was built like many other new L9 metro stations with a 16-meter depth and 26 meter diameter well. The station is divided in three levels: the upper hall, the upper platform and the lower platform. The upper hall has an only access from the street equipped with escalators and elevators, making the station accessible for disabled persons. The upper hall has also ticket vending machines and a TMB Control Center. The upper platform is where run the trains towards La Sagrera and the lower platform is where run the trains towards Can Zam and Gorg stations. Until the opening of the line to La Sagrera, the lower platform was closed and all trains travelled on the upper level. Architecture The walls of the tunnel where the platforms are located are cladded with cast stone panels with different densities, curves and perforations. The process combines white pre-cast stone with a gentle acid-etched finish and encrusted glass beads that let light filter through. Each platform is equipped with white cast stone benches with a shiny polished finish rest on cantilevered metal brackets to camouflage the station's air- conditioning outlets. This project was designed by architects A&M; in conjunction with Escofet while the architectural design of the station in general was designed by Tom√†s Morat√≥.

It represents the sum of the three powers, and deems the complete delegation of them into the executive power as a crime of high treason. The term was created in 1835, when governor Juan Manuel de Rosas was granted such powers by the legislature of Buenos Aires. Justo Jos√© de Urquiza led an army to depose Rosas in order to enact a Constitution, which Rosas had delayed for years, and the 1853 Constitution legally forbade such a thing from happening again. Historical context The death of the federalist caudillo Facundo Quiroga caused great concern in the Argentine Confederation, and soon the legislature of Buenos Aires elected Rosas as governor. A law from August 3, 1821, allowed the legislature to grant those powers.Jaime Galvez, p. 32 Those powers were fully delegated on him, with the sole exceptions of keeping, defending and protecting the Roman Catholic Church, and keeping and defending the cause of the Confederation.Decreto concediendo la suma del poder p√∫blico a Rosas The term of office of the governor, of three years, was extended to five years. The legislature reelected Rosas three times, allowing him three full mandates of 5 years, being overthrown during the fourth. Rosas could use the sum of public power during any time period he deemed convenient during his mandate. To confirm the legitimacy of his mandate, Rosas requested a vote to approve or reject him. Although there was no universal suffrage in Argentina by then, Rosas requested that all the people in Buenos Aires was allowed to vote, regardless of wealth or social conditions. This proposal was influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. The only ones who could not vote were the women, the slaves, children under 20 years old (unless emancipated) and foreigners without a stable residence in the country. The final result had 9720 votes for Rosas and only 8 against him.Jaime Galvez, p. 37 Nature Although Rosas received the sum of public power, he did not became an absolute monarch. He still had a limited term of office, and the legislature and other republican institutions were kept.Jaime Galvez, p. 38 It was not a tyranny either, as he did not have the usual traits of a tyranny. He did not took the power by an illegal way, such as a coup d'√©tat, but by an appointment of the legislature, and no law prevented the legislature from doing what it did. He did not become governor against the will of the population, as it was confirmed by a popular vote. He did not rule on behalf of a social minority, either. His appointment was in line with the ideas of Rousseau, who thought that \\"If, on the other hand, the peril is of such a kind that the paraphernalia of the laws are an obstacle to their preservation, the method is to nominate a supreme ruler, who shall silence all the laws and suspend for a moment the sovereign authority. In such a case, there is no doubt about the general will, and it is clear that the people‚Äôs first intention is that the State shall not perish\\".Rousseau, p. 84 This principle influenced as well the concept of the state of emergency, included in the 1853 constitution and in most legal systems around the world.Jaime G√°lvez, p. 39 Actual usage Rosas did not fully use the powers invested in him. He did not close the legislature, which continued working during his rule. He was not interested in the tasks of the judiciary power, so he did not use any judiciary powers after the end of the trial about the death of Facundo Quiroga. Even more, the governor used to be the highest court of appeal since the times of Spanish authority, so the legislature sanctioned a law in 1838 that established the \\"Tribunal Supremo de Recursos Extraordinarios\\", so that the highest court of the judiciary was still outside the executive power. Rosas gave his consent to the new law immediately.Jaime G√°lvez, p. 40 Controversy The delegation of the sum of public power on Rosas was highly controversial. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento compared Rosas with other historical dictators in his work Facundo, where he said as follows: On the contrary, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n gave his full support to the delegation, on the grounds that the current situation in the country was so chaotic that it was needed to create order. Constitutional status Rosas's mandate ended after his defeat at the Battle of Caseros, and Urquiza called for the making of a National Constitution, which was written the following year, 1853. The 29¬∫ article explicitly forbids a delegation of powers such as the one done with Rosas to be performed. However, the penalty for the 1835 release of the public power to Rosas is not affected by this ruling, as the Constitution was not established back then and had no ex post facto law provisions.Jaime G√°lvez, pp. 36-37 References Bibliography Category:Juan Manuel de Rosas Category:Argentine law Category:Argentine Civil War Category:Emergency laws Category:1835 in law Category:1835 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Sum of public power"},{"id":"27070378","text":"Horner is an unincorporated community in Lewis County, West Virginia, United States.

Appaloosa Management invests in public equity and fixed income markets around the world. History In 1993, David Tepper and Jack Walton, founded Appaloosa Management, an employee- owned hedge fund, in Chatham, New Jersey. Throughout the 1990s, the firm was known as a junk bond investment boutique, and through the 2000s it was known as a hedge fund. =2002 Conseco & Marconi Corp.= In the fourth quarter of 2002, Appaloosa Management returns were heavily a result of junk-bond and distressed debt bets in Conseco and Marconi Corp. that the market was bottoming out. =2007 Delphi= Assets under management in 2007 were $5.3 billion. The Financial Times reports the company has \\"attracted interest for its large ownership position in Delphi, the bankrupt car parts supplier, and its clashes on whether management has the shareholders best interests in mind or those of GM and the UAW.\\" =2008 financial crisis through 2011= Appaloosa survived the financial crisis of 2008 with relatively few investor redemption orders. From 2009 to 2010, Appaloosa Management's assets under management grew from $5 billion to $12 billion. In November 2010, the New York Times reported total assets under management of $14 billion. In 2010, it was reported that since 1993 Appaloosa Management had returned $12.4 billion to clients‚Äîranking it sixth on a ranking of total returns to clients by managers since inception. In September 2011, a Delaware bankruptcy court found that Appaloosa Management is one of four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual‚Äôs restructuring which might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank‚Äôs debt. In 2011, the company was awarded the Institutional Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award. In January 2016, Appaloosa's headquarters were relocated to Miami Beach, Florida. Investment strategy Appaloosa Management's investments focus on undiversified concentrated investment positions. Appaloosa invests in the global public equity and fixed income markets with a focus on \\"equities and debt of distressed companies, bonds, exchange warrants, options, futures, notes, and junk bonds.\\" According to BusinessWeek, the firm's client base consists of high-net-worth individuals, pension and profit sharing plans, corporations, foreign governments, foundations, universities, and other organizations.\\" Investors commit to a locked period of three years during which their withdrawals are limited to 25 percent of their total investment. Products and performance Appaloosa Management manages four investment vehicles: the offshore Palomino Fund LTD, an offshore and onshore version of its Thoroughbred fund, and its flagship fund Appaloosa Investment. A complete list of current holdings can be found here. =Palomino Fund= The Palomino Fund from its inception in 1995 to 1998 had a 25 percent return. After Russia defaulted, the fund lost 49 percent of its value between February to September 1998. The fund returned ‚Äì26.7% percent in 2008 and 117.3 percent in 2009. The company was ranked by Bloomberg Markets as the top performing fund of any hedge fund manager managing over one billion dollars. =Appaloosa Investment I= In 2001, the fund was up 67 percent followed the next year losing 25 percent.
