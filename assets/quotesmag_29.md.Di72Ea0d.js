He dropped out of school at fifteen, and took up an apprenticeship as an electrical fitter with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. He worked in the Kemira mines for two years after the completion of his apprenticeship, before shifting to the Coalcliff mines, where he spent a further 24 years. He joined the Labor Party in response to the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, and was active in his local branches for many years thereafter.Heinzman, Sarah. \\"Col's calling\\". Illawarra Mercury, 21 February 2004. State politics Markham won Labor preselection for the newly created seat of Keira in 1988, following the abolition of the previously safe Labor seat of Corrimal held by the long-serving Member for Corrimal, Laurie Kelly. Kelly challenged sitting Independent MP Frank Arkell for his seat of Wollongong, but was defeated. Markham won a narrow victory and was subsequently reelected at the 1991 and 1995 State elections, increasing his majority at each election. Markham developed a reputation as an occasionally outspoken local MP, publicly clashing with his party over their policies on the coal industry not long after his election.Lagan, Bernard. \\"Boos for govt's new deal on coal\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 4 October 1988. He was promoted into the shadow ministry in 1989, taking the position of Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, but was cut upon the election of the Carr government in 1995 after struggling to gain a profile in the role.Moore, Matthew. \\"Carr is rebuffed by rebel factions\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 11 May 1988.Totaro, Paola. \\"Right-wing brawl first test for Carr\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 1 April 1995. Markham was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Aboriginal Affairs after his demotion from Cabinet, and was a persistent advocate for Aboriginal issues throughout the remainder of his parliamentary career. He was the architect of early land rights legislation transferring a number of government-owned sites into the control of their traditional owners, and continually campaigned for action from the state government on Aboriginal reconciliation, ultimately resulting in the Carr government's Statement of Commitment on Aboriginal reconciliation in 1997.Lawson, Michael. \\"Actions speak louder – Markham\\". Illawarra Mercury, 28 November 1997.Field, Anthony. \\"A dream realised for Aborigines\\". Illawarra Mercury, 23 July 2004. He was also a frequent advocate for local workers as the job cuts of the 1990s hit the Wollongong economy hard.Lawson, Michael. \\"Marvellous view moves Markham\\". Illawarra Mercury, 22 December 1997.Tindall, Ron. \\"Foster potential, don't fob us off, says Markham\\". Illawarra Mercury, 4 August 1997. Markham had long faced rumours of a preselection challenge from the right-faction, which had been gaining increasing dominance in his region through the late 1990s. As a popular local member, however, he was tipped to be difficult to shift, and planned challenges for the 1991 and 1995 elections never eventuated.\\"Editorial\\". Illawarra Mercury, 17 July 1997. He faced a much more difficult situation ahead of the 1999 election, however, when an electoral redistribution saw the right-wing faction gain firm control of the electorate's Labor branches. A deal was struck by which Markham would instead contest preselection for the neighbouring seat of Wollongong, held by fellow left-winger Gerry Sullivan. Markham won preselection for Wollongong, but his treatment by the party caused a local backlash, with Wollongong councillor Dave Martin running for and nearly winning Markham's old seat of Keira as an independent.Carty, Lisa. \\"When two into one won't go\\". Illawarra Mercury, 19 November 1998.Humphries, David. \\"Party dealing puts Shaw back on ticket\\". Illawarra Mercury, 20 November 1998.

Daily Telegraph, 1 May 1999.Ellis, Greg. \\"Sorry is not a dirty word\\". Illawarra Mercury, 28 May 1999. He faced speculation about another challenge for his seat in 2002, when it was leaked to the press that his name was on an internal party \\"hit-list\\" for the next election.McInerney, Paul. \\"Angry Col says he's not Markham time\\". Illawarra Mercury, 13 March 1999. Long a target of the right wing, the faction had been especially angered by his refusal to cross a union picket line at Parliament House in opposition to Carr government workers compensation changes that were deeply unpopular in Markham's blue-collar electorate.West, Andrew. \\"How the Illawarra is poisoning Labor\\". Illawarra Mercury, 18 August 1999. The speculation received a sharp response from the trade union movement, with the local divisions of six major unions threatening protests and support for independent candidacies if Markham was toppled by head office.O'Connor, Kerrie. \\"Left's ultimatum to end branch stacking\\". Illawarra Mercury, 23 May 2002. Markham's impending axing took on federal consequences when angry local unions and left-wing groups directed their resources against the right faction candidate Labor had endorsed for a by-election in the federal seat of Cunningham; in a shock result, Green candidate Michael Organ won the seat after a disastrous Labor campaign.West, Andrew. \\"Labor feels like it's going, going, Gong\\". Illawarra Mercury, 13 October 2002. Markham received a late endorsement from Premier Bob Carr ahead of the 2002 preselection vote, but this was not enough to sway the right- dominated preselectors, who voted for Noreen Hay, a local left faction figure who defected to the right soon after.Carty, Lisa. \\"D-day: Carr backs Markham in preselection battle\\".

Tickets to his farewell dinner at the WIN Entertainment Centre sold out five days before it was held. Community involvement After leaving politics, Markham maintained his interest in Aboriginal affairs, serving as an Executive Member, Deputy Chairperson, and Ambassador of the New South Wales Reconciliation Council. He held a strong interest in rugby league and was a Director of the Illawarra Steelers Board and Gold Foundation Member of the Illawarra Steelers as well as Chairman of the Illawarra Steelers' Injured Player Fund. In 2003, he was awarded as an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wollongong.

It is found in the Indo-Pacific region. Description Plectropomus laevis has a body which is elongate and robust, with the standard length being 2.9 to 3.9 times the depth of the body. The preopercle is mostly rounded, with three large,downward pointing spines along the bottome half. The dorsal fin contains 7-8 spines and 10-12 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 8 soft rays. The spiny part of the dorsal fin has a shorter base than the soft-rayed part. The caudal fin is a truncate. This species has two colour phases, one with black saddles on a whitish background colour with a yellow caudal peduncle and yellow fins is known as the \\"footballer phase\\"; the other being a greyish form which has a dark head, five dark saddle markings along the back and small blue spots on body. The juveniles are Batesian mimics of the toxic Valentin's sharpnose puffer (Canthigaster valentini). This species attains a total length of , although they are commonly around , and a maximum published weight of . Distribution Plectropomus laevis has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. In eastern Africa it occurs from Kenya to Mozambique through islands of the tropical Indian Ocean, but not the Asian coast, and east into the Pacific Ocean as far east as French Polynesia and Pitcairn Island, north as far as southern Japan and south as far as Australia. In Australia it is found at Rowley Shoals and Scott Reef in Western Australia, Ashmore Reef in the Timor Sea and on the Great Barrier Reef as far south as One Tree Island and other reefs in the Coral Sea of Queensland, as well as in the region of Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea/ Habitat and biology Plectropomus laevis is found in lagoon areas which have good coral cover and the seaward side of reefs where it appears to prefer reef channels and the outer shelf of the reef. It is found at depths between . The juveniles of both colour phases with total length's of less than mimic Valentin's sharpnose puffer and usually scull with their pectoral fins for swimming while theyhold the caudal fin folded and the first few spines of the spiny part of the dorsal fin held erect. This species forages over larger areas and a wider depth range than the sympatric Plectropomus leopardus. They are monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, in which the males only develop from mature females, the youngest males found have been 9 years of age and females mature at 2.2 years and at around in fork length. This species is comparatively fast growing and may attain a length of in less than four years and females may be sexually mature in less than three years. They form small spawning aggregations although large aggregations have been recorded from the northern Great Barrier Reef. It is likely that this species spawns in deeper waters on reef fronts compared to P. leopardus and this may be the reason for the lack of spawning observations for P. laevis. The adults feed on a variety of larger reef fishes, including other groupers, while the juveniles feed on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crustaceans and squid. Parasites As most fish, this species harbours many parasite species. The diplectanid monogeneans Echinoplectanum laeve and Echinoplectanum chauvetorum are parasites on the gills. Taxonomy Plectropomus laevis was first formally described as Labrus laevis in 1801 by the French zoologist Bernard Germain de Lacépède with the type locality given as Grand golfe de l'lnde, the Indian Ocean. Utilisation Plectropomus laevis is a prized food fish but their diet dominated by fish means that the consumption of its flesh has been responsible for many instances of ciguatera poisoning. It is caught using hook-and-line, spears and fish traps. It is becoming more important in the live reef food fish trade and it also appears in the aquarium trade.

Alexandros Alexandrakis (Athens, 1913 - Athens, 1968) was a Greek painter, who became widely known from his particularly dynamic depictions of the Greco-Italian War of 1940. Alexandrakis showed an early talent for design and painting. In the age of 17, he exhibited 23 works in the group show organised by HAN. He then studied painting in Athens School of Fine Arts under the supervision of masters Spyridonas Vikatos and Umbertos Argyros. Later, he attended classes in engraving by the master Giannis Kefallinos. He graduated from the school in 1937, and went on to participate in various exhibitions. In World War II, which in Greece is called the Greco-Italian War, Alexandrakis and his five brothers were called to military duty to the Greek-Albanian borders. He found himself in the high mountainous area of 'Pindos' where he served as corporal. Inspired by his situation, he sketched and painted his memories in a series of artworks that made him popular in Greece in the post-war years. A collection of them was published in 1968 with the title 'Thus we fought' (original in Greek: Έτσι πολεμούσαμε). He also spent considerable time with Art nude and in 1958 Alexandrakis was the illustrator of public junior school book for the fifth grade. He became known outside Greece when he started collaborating with institutions such as the Guggenheim Museum and USA Senator Library. He died at the age of 55.

He was the eldest son of the former Margaret Sheila Mackellar Chisholm (1898–1969) and Hon. Frances Edward Scudamore St Clair-Erskine, styled Lord Loughborough (1892–1929), who was known as \\"the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo\\" His younger brother was Peter George Alex St Clair-Erskine, who served in the Royal Air Force until his death in 1939. His parents divorced in 1926 and his mother married Sir John Milbanke, 11th Baronet in 1928. They also divorced and she married Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia in 1954. His maternal grandfather was Harry Chisholm of Sydney. His paternal grandparents were James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn and the former Violet Aline Vyner (the second daughter and co- heiress of Robert Charles de Grey Vyner of Gautby Hall and Newby Hall).

His \\"Verses on the Battle that was Fought at Fontenoy\\" are a first-hand description of the Battle of Fontenoy of 25 June 841, in which he participated with the army of Lothair I. They are an important piece of battle literature from the twilight of the Carolingian Renaissance. Historian Bernard Bachrach has examined them as a source for the emotional effects of battle during the ninth century.Bernard S. Bachrach (2001), Early Carolingian Warfare: Prelude to Empire (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, ), 132-34. According to his poem, Angelbert fought on the front line, stationed on a hill overlooking a stream. He was the only survivor (solus de multis remani) of the men in his unit. The night after the battle is \\"especially terrible\\".Bachrach, 132, says it \\"catches much of what is eternal for the Western fighting man\\". The day after the battle he cannot hold back tears, but he urges the other survivors to hold them back. This battle, he says, should be forgotten: Laude pugna non est digna, nec canatur melode (\\"The battle does not deserve to be praised or to be the subject of fine song\\").For a full translation, see Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 262-265, with analysis at 48-50\\\\. It was also translated by Helen Waddell in her Medieval Latin Lyrics (1929). Two major streams of interpretation of Angelbert's poem exist. The first sees it as a \\"ballad of victory\\" rooted in vernacular Germanic poetry. Angelbert is assumed to have spoken Old High German, and the imagery of birds and beasts consuming the corpses of the dead has been assumed to be borrowed from Old High German literature. There is no such surviving literature with such imagery and it is supposed to have existed on analogy with Old English and Old Norse traditions of the same. The imagery is also found in other Carolingian poetry, e.g. of Radbod of Utrecht and Florus of Lyons, and it probably reflects the reality of battle, not Germanic traditionRoberta Frank (1987), \\"Did Anglo-Saxon Audiences Have a Skaldic Tooth?,\\" Scandinavian Studies, 59:3, 348. The breaking of family bonds mentioned by Angelbert is common to the Hildebrandslied, but the themes of mistaken identity and heroic duty are absent from Angelbert and Carolingian Latin poetry in general. The \\"Battle of Fontenoy\\" also differs from vernacular Germanic literature, like the Ludwigslied, as it has much historical detail. Angelbert wrote \\"in order to describe the actual events of his own lifetime,\\" which has more in common with contemporary Latin trends.Godman, 50, cites the Versus de Verona and the De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica as examples of this trend. The latinity of the \\"Battle of Fontenoy\\" is learned, and it has the marks of a planctus in the Carolingian tradition. It has the interesting features of citing David's lament of the death of Saul in II Samuel (1:21), and its effect on nature, which Paulinus II of Aquileia cites in his planctus on the death in battle of Eric of Friuli.Godman, 49. The main influence on the text is the Christian Bible: for example, Lothair's treasonous duces (leaders of the units) are likened to Judas Iscariot. Rhythmically, the poem is an imitation of Venantius Fortunatus' Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis. The strophes begin with the letters of the alphabet from A to P as a mnemonic device aiding recitation. Angelbert's poem is preserved in manuscript BnF lat. 1154, originally from Saint Martial of Limoges in Aquitaine; Pippin I of Aquitaine was an ally of Lothair. The poem presents the partisan viewpoint of Lothair and Pippin's men; Florus of Lyons represents the view of the other side, of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, in his \\"Lament on the Division of the Empire\\".Godman, 50, says that \\"Fontenoy, in Angelbert's eyes, was a crime.\\" Angelbert refers to the rupta pace (broken peace) and the fract ... lex Christianorum (broken law of Christians).

Background During Bishops’ Wars of 1639 and 1640, Milton joined the factions opposing the policies of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the policies of the Church of England. Soon after, an antiprelatical movement started and the Root and Branch petition was put to Parliament 11 December 1640. The petition called for the end of the episcopal hierarchy and Laud was removed from his position on 18 December 1640. After a few months, a royalist, pro-episcopal movement was started. This movement was led by Joseph Hall, and it was he that produced pamphlets supporting the Church of England hierarchy.Wheeler 2003 p. 265 Hall published An Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament in January 1641. The tract argued in support of the Church of England's liturgy and the episcopal hierarchy of the church. This work was responded to by Smectymnuus, five Puritan clergy, in the work An Answer to a Booke Entituled, An Humble Remonstrance. This publication started a pamphlet dispute between the two sides, and Hall published A Defence of the Humble Remonstrance against the Frivolous... Exceptions of Smectymnuus on 12 April 1641. This tract was responded to with Vindication of the Answer to the Humble Remonstrance, from the Unjust Imputations of Frivolousness and Falsehood on 26 June 1641 by Smectymnuus. Milton joined in the debate with his Of Reformation published May 1641. The debate between Hall and Milton became personalised as the conflict progressed, with an ever-increasing emphasis on personal integrity. Tracts =Of Reformation= Of Reformation was Milton's first independently produced work, and was published in May 1641.Wheeler 2003 p. 266 Milton's argument focuses on both the role of church government and of government in general, especially of the importance of republicanism.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 298 Throughout the work, Milton opposed the establishment of a central Church government because he believed that individual congregations should govern themselves.Rumrich 2003 p. 146 =Of Prelatical Episcopacy= Of Prelatical Episcopacy is the shortest of Milton's antiprelatical tracts and was written as a response to many works, including Archbishop James Ussher's The Judgement of Doctor Rainoldes Touching the Originall of Episcopacy (25 May 1641). The tract was published in either June or July 1641. Milton's main argument is a discussion of the nature of truth and how truth can only be attained through scripture. The work is openly hostile to any need for a medium between the Bible and the individual reader, especially such mediation as is provided by an organized church.Wheeler 2003 pp. 269–270 =Animadversions= Animadversions, published July 1641, was written as a response to the works and claims of Hall. The tract is filled with direct attacks against Hall's person, and this is accomplished through satire and mockery. Like his other tracts, Milton continues to attack the authority of church governments and liturgies while emphasizing how an individual's reading of the Bible is more important than other considerations.Wheeler 2003 pp. 270–272 =The Reason of Church-Government= Milton published The Reason for Church-Government Urg'd against Prelaty in January/February 1642. Although the tract was the fourth of his antiprelatical tracts, there was a 6 months delay after the publication of Animadversions. The work is a response to an attack on his previous works which was titled Certain Briefe Treatises, Written by Diverse Learned Men, Concerning the Ancient and Moderne Government of the Church. Unlike Milton's previous three, he including his name upon the tract and he emphasized himself within the text.Wheeler 2003 p. 272 This tract includes a detailed discussion, in the preface of Book II, of Miltons views on literature and genres.Lewalski 2003 p. 3 =Apology for Smectymnuus= Apology for Smectymnuus was published in April 1642 and is his final antiprelatical tract. The tract was written as a response to another refutation by Hall against an earlier tract.Wheeler 2003 p. 273 The tract praises Parliament and emphasizes that they are both reformers and the foundation of England.Keeble 2003 p. 132 The work also contains some of Milton's Aristotelian feelings about man as a political animal.Wheeler 2003 p. 275 Notes References * Dzelzainis, Martin. \\"Republicanism\\" in A Companion to Milton.

The killing of a young student by police resulted in large protests and demonstrations, which escalated to widespread rioting, with numerous rioters damaging property and engaging riot police with Molotov cocktails, stones and other objects. Demonstrations and rioting soon spread to several other cities, including Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. Outside Greece, solidarity demonstrations, riots and, in some cases, clashes with local police also took place in more than 70 cities around the world,Interactive solidarity map : Static image : in Europe including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Cologne, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, the Hague, London, Madrid, Nicosia, Paphos, Paris, Rome and Seville and globally from São Paulo,São Paulo, Fotos do Dia Internacional de Ação contra os assassinatos dos Estado http://brasil.indymedia.org/pt/blue/2008/12/435749.shtml San Francisco and Wellington to Buenos Aires and Siberia.Small anarchist demonstration in Barnaul, Siberia disrupted by cops, some people detained Newspaper Kathimerini called the rioting \\"the worst Greece has seen since the restoration of democracy in 1974\\". While the unrest was triggered by the shooting incident, commentators described the reactions as expressing deeper causes as well, especially a widespread feeling of frustration in the younger generation about specific economic problems of the country (partly as a result of the global economic crisis), a rising unemployment rate among the young generation and a perception of general inefficiency and corruption in Greek state institutions. The shooting incident The shooting victim, Alexandros Grigoropoulos. The fatal shooting that triggered the riots and protests took place in the evening of 6 December 2008, shortly after 9 pm, in the Exarcheia district of central Athens. According to press reports, two Special Guards (Ειδικοί Φρουροί) (a special category of the Greek police personnel, originally meant for guard duties on public property) had been engaged in a minor verbal clash with a small group of teenagers in a main street of Exarcheia, outside a shop. On driving away in their police car, they were then confronted by another small group at a nearby street crossing. The two guards were ordered by the Greek police center of operations to disengage immediately and withdraw from the confrontation site. However, the two guards did not comply and were later accused of insubordination. Instead, the two special guards chose to station their police vehicle outside the PASOK headquarters, left the car and went to Tzavella Street on foot, in order to confront the youngsters. Following some exchange of verbal abuse that, according to several witnesses, was initiated by the guards, one of them, Epaminondas Korkoneas, fired his gun. The initial police's report on the incident claims that the special guard shot in response to a renewed attack by the youths, that involved throwing stones and bottles. Eyewitnesses who spoke to Greek media, however, reported that the special guards were not attacked by the youths, nor was their physical safety put in danger at any time. Instead, the special guards approached the group and verbally assaulted them in order to provoke them. The special guard said he fired three rounds, two warning shots in the air and a third aimed on the ground. Several eyewitnesses said they believed the policeman had directly targeted the youngsters. The victim, Alexandros – Andreas Grigoropoulos () was a 15-year-old student, who lived in the affluent northern Athens suburb of Palaio Psychiko and attended a private school (the Moraitis School).Staff report (10 December 2008). title=Teenage death sends thousands to the streets. Die Welt Immediately following the shooting, he was transported to the nearby Evangelismos Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Investigation of the shooting Tzavella street, Alexandros Grigoropoulos's murder spot. A criminal investigation was initiated against the police officer who fired the shot, on a charge of murder (\\"intentional homicide\\" according to Greek law), while his partner was charged as an accomplice. Both were suspended from duty and were kept in detention. The defense counsel that was initially hired resigned shortly after accepting the case, citing personal reasons. On 10 December, Alexis Kougias, counsel for the defendants, said that preliminary results of the ballistic tests apparently show that it was indeed a ricochet and that the two policemen will only appear before the public prosecutor after the forensic, toxicological, and ballistic examinations had been completed. However, the results of forensic tests indicated that the bullet that killed Grigoropoulos had entered the youth's body directly. This cast doubt on claims, by the 37-year-old policeman charged with the boy's murder, that the bullet had been fired as a warning and ricocheted. On the morning of 11 December, Dimitris Tsovolas, former MP and economic minister under the previous government, formed by PASOK agreed to serve as the counsel for Grigoropoulos' family. On the same day, counsel for the two policemen involved in the shooting released an explanatory statement, that described the deceased as demonstrating \\"deviant behaviour.\\" According to the memorandum, Grigoropoulos was a teenager from a wealthy family, he frequented the Exarcheia district, had allegedly taken part in riotous activities that took place following the end of a basketball game two hours before he was shot, and that, in general, \\"the victim did not show the expected behaviour and personality of a 15-year-old adolescent.\\" Grigoropoulos' family, friends, schoolmates and high school teachers immediately condemned those statements and declared in public that the allegations in the defendants' memorandum are \\"completely inaccurate\\" and \\"insulting\\"; the private school Grigoropoulos attended also issued a public statement that denies all the allegations. Kougias' stance, as well as his comments in the explanatory memorandum, forced the Athens bar association to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him. On 15 December, Kougias appealed for the two defendants to be released from custody, on the grounds that neither of them ever had any previous criminal convictions, that their names and addresses were known, that they had considerable ties with their community, and that the charges were based on the testimony of witnesses that the defendants objected to. Specifically, the defendants' counsel took issue with the testimony of four eyewitnesses who had testified for the public prosecutor, and appeared to refute almost all the claims made by the defendants and their counsel. On 17 December, Dimitris Tsovolas, counsel for Grigoropoulos' family, publicly requested that the defendants and defendants' counsel stop provoking the Greek people and the victim's family by making degrading comments, unsubstantiated accusations, and smearing the memory of Alexandros. The ballistics report was also released on 17 December and stated that the bullet that killed Grigoropoulos had in fact ricocheted. However, forensic reports conducted on 21 December concluded that the bullet was not fired in the air, but rather towards the group of teenagers, though there may have been no intention to kill the boy. Court decision On 11 October 2010, the Mixed Jury Court of Amfissa (consisting of 3 judges and 4 jurors) found the two special guards guilty. Epaminondas Korkoneas was found guilty of \\"homicide with direct intention to cause harm\\" and Vasilis Saraliotis was found guilty as an accomplice. Korkoneas was sentenced to lifetime and an additional 15 months of imprisonment (votes 4–3) while Saraliotis was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment (votes 6–1). In July 2019, the life sentence against Korkoneas was overturned on appeal and reduced to 13 years imprisonment, and Korkoneas was subsequently released from prison. The riots and political crisis =First 2 days= Within the hour following the shooting of Grigoropoulοs, angry demonstrators took to the streets in and around Exarcheia, and violent confrontations with the police erupted. Meanwhile, similar demonstrations were reported in other Greek cities as well, including Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Komotini, Kastoria, Patras, Tripoli, Volos, Chios, Trikala, Mytilene, Agrinio, Kavala, Corfu, Piraeus, Chania, Heraklion, Rhodes, Karditsa, Lamia, Stylida, Drama, Xanthi, Lagkadas, Kozani, Alexandroupoli, Larisa and Corinth. After midnight, the demonstrations in Athens turned into violent rioting in some central streets of the city. By dawn on Sunday, 24 police officers had been injured, one seriously (with facial burns and his little finger mutilated) and 31 shops (particularly across Ermou Street), 9 banks, and 25 cars had been either seriously damaged, burned, or destroyed within the downtown area. Location of the incidents in Athens. Two rioters in the streets of Athens Rioters in Komotini. Rioters throwing rocks at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and smoke from burning trash bins. Graffiti at Panepistimiou Street (translation: \\"cops, pigs, murderers\\"). Smoke billows through a street Destroyed building of the European Law Library, Sina and Akadimias Streets. =First week= By Sunday 7 December 2008 38 vehicles were damaged, 13 police officers were injured, and 22 rioters were arrested. Monday 8 December 2008 saw police assess damage as daily schedules resumed and rioting subsided. However, all was not quiet, as all over Greece, several thousands of high school students walked out of their schools and marched on local police stations, throwing eggs, paint bombs, and water bottles. Protesters continued to occupy university campuses around the nation, while organizations such as the Communist Party of Greece announced plans for protests later that day. The massive demonstrations of that evening were confronted by police using tear gas; during the demonstrations, some 11 public buildings around the central plaza of Athens, Syntagma Square, were set on fire. Students around Greece proceeded to occupy their school buildings, in protest, including in Serres, Imathia, Chalkidiki, Pieria, and Thessaloniki. The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the National Technical University of Athens, as well as the Athens University of Economics and Business remained under student occupation. Rioters also set fire to the Kostis Palamas building that led to the total destruction of the European Law Library situated at the corner of Akadimias and Sina street., After the fire, the rector of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Christos Kittas, resigned, but some days later withdrew his resignation. A police report released Tuesday, 9 December 2008 in the morning put the numbers of injured police officers at 12, arrested rioters at 87, and persons who had been brought before a public prosecutor at 176. In Thessaloniki, 16 rioters were arrested for theft, 3 of whom were under 18 years old. After four days of rioting, some citizens began to act against the rioters, and some rioters fired on police officers. Citizens attacked people that were found looting and were seen throwing stones to protect their belongings. In the city of Patras, according to the city's mayor, members of far-left organisations took part in the violence. In Athens, seven police officers were injured, four rioters were arrested for violence against the police, 12 were arrested for theft and 55 were arrested for rioting with another 25 people of non-Greek nationality arrested for the same reason. In a report on Tuesday, Amnesty International accused the Greek Police of brutality in handling the riots. The Greek department of Amnesty International canceled the scheduled celebrations on 10 December for the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in response to the police violence in Greece. The crisis deepened on Wednesday 10 December 2008 when the General Confederation of Greek Workers (ΓΣΕΕ) and the Civil Servants' Confederation (ΑΔΕΔΥ), representing 2.5 million workers or roughly half of the total Greek workforce, called a one-day general strike in protest against the government's economic policies. Rioting continued in Athens as thousands of workers gathered for anti-government protests at Syntagma Square. On Thursday, 11 December 2008 4,000 students marched against the police, with many protesters throwing firebombs at the officers. On Friday, 12 December 2008 students attacked police outside the parliament building. Riot police fired tear gas in response. Heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days. The protests inspired small protests in some European cities, sowing fears of copycat riots elsewhere. On the same day, Greek police issued an appeal for more tear gas after supplies ran low, since more than 4,600 capsules of it were released against the protestors by that time. On Saturday, 13 December 2008 large groups of demonstrators gathered in front of the Greek Parliament in central Athens. Despite the fact that the protest in front of the Greek parliament was relatively peaceful, the riot police attempted to dissolve it at 1:30 (local time) by using tear gas and violence. On the same day, about 100 protesters firebombed a police station near the Exarcheia district where was killed. On Sunday, 14 December 2008 students joined residents of the Exarcheia district to demand the renaming of that street in honour of the dead teenager. Also, at least four radio stations based in Athens were occupied by protesters. In Thessaloniki, students demonstrated in solidarity with all the people who were arrested as a result of rioting over the past week. =Second week= On Monday, 15 December 2008 students gathered outside the Attica General Police Directorate in central Athens. The riot police chose to dissolve the protest through violence after some of the demonstrators threw eggs against one riot police squad. Many of the demonstrators were of school-age. Several newspapers report that the protesters were provoked by policemen. In Piraeus, approximately 300 students rallied outside the local Korydallos Prison and taunted the police who fired tear gas to disperse them. According to teachers' unions, some 600 schools were under occupation, while 150 university facilities across the country had been taken over according to the Greek Ministry of Education. In Ioannina, the local public radio station was occupied by students and far-leftist groups. Rallies and demonstrations have also taken place in Chania, Heraklion, Larissa and Thessaloniki. On Tuesday, 16 December 2008 rallies and protests took place outside many police stations in Athens and Piraeus. Early in the afternoon, masked youths emerged from the university complex in Zografou and firebombed nearby Athens' riot police headquarters. Six police officers were injured and ten vehicles were burnt. Meanwhile, a group of around 30 protesters infiltrated the studios of public broadcaster ERT and interrupted a news broadcast featuring Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis. For about a minute, the protesters stood in front of the camera holding banners reading \\"Stop watching, get out into the streets.\\" ERT Chairman Christos Panagopoulos tendered his resignation over the incident but it was rejected by the government. \\"It is unacceptable for unidentified individuals to deprive others of their right to information,\\" he said. On Wednesday, 17 December 2008 a rally was held outside the capital's main courthouses, where youths threw eggs and fruit at the police. There was also one demonstration organised by the All-Workers Militant Front (ΠΑΜΕ) in central Athens from Omonoia Square to the Greek Parliament, drawing around 5000 people. Student protesters evaded security guards at the Acropolis of Athens and unfurled two giant pink banners over a wall near the Parthenon to rally support for continued demonstrations. \\"Thursday 18/12 demonstrations in all Europe,\\" one banner read, while the other simply bore the message, \\"Resistance,\\" in Greek, English, Spanish and German. \\"We chose this monument to democracy, this global monument, to proclaim our resistance to state violence and demand rights in education and work,\\" \\"(We did it) to send a message globally and to all Europe.\\" said the protestors. Government spokesman, Evangelos Antonaros, said this protest was \\"inexcusable\\" and accused the protesters of tarnishing Greece's image abroad. In Kaisariani, near the riot police headquarters that were targeted by youths on Tuesday, a group of anarchists torched a police bus. The only person in the bus, the driver, managed to escape unhurt. In another protest, about 40 people – including workers, immigrants and unemployed citizens – occupied the offices of the country's main labor union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers (ΓΣΕΕ). The union's president, Giannis Panagopoulos, said the protest was mistargeted: \\"The GSEE does not govern this country\\". A protest was also held outside the Prefecture of Thessaloniki offices and the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace which is also based in Thessaloniki. Late that night, a homemade explosive device planted outside a branch of Eurobank in the Thessaloniki district of Kalamaria damaged the building's facade when it detonated. A similar device smashed the windows of a local Citizens' Information and Service Center (ΚΕΠ). In Ioannina, the town hall was occupied, while in Chania, a local television station remained under occupation by protesters for about 1 hour. On Thursday, 18 December 2008 demonstrations took place in central Athens, more than 12,000 protesters crowded the streets near the Greek parliament in a peaceful demonstration in central Athens which turned violent when a group of protesters broke away from the rally and threw rocks and firebombs at police and buildings near Parliament, overturned a car and set fire to trash cans, splashed the police with red paint and tried to burn down the city's main Christmas tree which had just been replaced after being torched during the previous week's riots. The police responded with tear gas and flash grenades, and drove the rioters back toward the administrative headquarters of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the university's School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences. After another round of pitched battles between masked rioters and the police, several hundred protesters entered the School of Law, Economics and Political Sciences. Christmas shoppers fled the streets and retailers rolled down their shutters as protesters smashed store fronts and burned at least four cars. Demonstrations also took place in Thessaloniki where protesters gathered outside the Ministry for Macedonia–Thrace. Rallies and protests also took place in Patras, Tripoli, Chania and Trikala. Some labour unions stopped work in solidarity with the demonstrators. The work stoppage by the air traffic controllers forced Olympic Airlines to cancel 28 flights and postpone 14. Hospitals were also operating with very limited staff. On Friday, 19 December 2008 a protest took place outside the Greek parliament, and a solidarity concert outside the administrative building of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. More than 1500 people demonstrated peacefully in the western suburb of Athens, Peristeri following another shooting of a 16-year- old on Wednesday, 17 December, night. The teenager was struck in the hand by a bullet fired by an unidentified assailant while sitting in a park, outside a local high school with friends. The police admitted that they had made a mistake in their initial statement that the boy was hit by an air-gun pellet. Tests revealed it was either a .38 Special or .357 Magnum bullet. Officers are investigating the incident, anxious to disprove rumors that an off-duty or undercover policeman fired the shot. A police spokesman said that no officers were in the area at the time of the shooting and an investigation was under way. Masked youths attacked the French Institute in Athens with firebombs, \\"Spark in Athens. Fire in Paris. Insurrection is coming,\\" read one graffiti spray-painted onto the building's walls in French. Another, written in Greek, read \\"France, Greece, uprising everywhere\\". Later on Friday, about 50 protesters interrupted the official premiere of the Greek National Theater, holding up banners urging people to join the demonstrations. On Saturday, 20 December 2008 about 150 youth attacked the Christmas tree at Syntagma Square in central Athens, at around 16.00, hanging trash bags from its branches before clashing with riot police. The square was cleared within two hours. At least three news photographers were injured by police batons. The Christmas tree protest had been advertised as part of a day of events in Greece and around the world to commemorate Grigoropoulos' shooting. On Saturday evening, masked men broke into the building housing the offices of Tiresias SA, a company that keeps records of delinquent debtors and cardholders, and firebombed the company's offices. The fire was extinguished but the company's offices were destroyed. Rioters, using the National Technical University of Athens as a base, launched attacks against police, throwing rocks and petrol bombs and erecting roadblocks. In Thessaloniki a group of anarchists briefly occupied a radio station and a theater before disrupting and threw cakes and candy at Mayor Vassilis Papageorgopoulos and one of his deputies during an open-air charity event near the theater. Later, a group emerged from the same theater and attacked a Nativity scene, throwing away Christ's figure. On Sunday, 21 December 2008 in the early hours of the morning, unidentified hood- wearing assailants threw petrol bombs at the police academy in the west Athens district of Nea Philadelphia six police vehicles were torched, without causing any casualties. The vehicles that were parked outside the building of the police accounting department at Patriarchou Constantinou street, also suffered damage in the attack. At around the same time, rioting and clashes with riot police continued in the area around the National Technical University of Athens and the University of Thessaloniki, with protesters again lobbing petrol bombs at police. =Third week= On Tuesday, 23 December 2008 more than 3,000 chanting protesters marched through Athens. During the demonstration, one police car was damaged. At 05:50 local time, shots were fired at a riot police bus in Athens near the riot police headquarters in Zografou. None of the 19 officers on board were injured, authorities said, but the attack raised concern that violence against police could escalate. The shots were fired from the grounds of the National Technical University of Athens's facilities in Zografou, known as Polytechnioupolis. One bullet blew out two tires on the bus, while another struck the engine. The police found 7.62 mm caliber bullet casings at the scene of the shooting. After ballistic examinations, it was announced that there were at least two shooters who used Kalashnikov type rifles and that the particular weapons used in the attack had not been used in any other attack, robbery, or other criminal incident in Greece. On Wednesday, 24 December 2008, hundreds of anarchists marched through Athens streets in a peaceful protest. On Thursday, 25 December 2008, in central Athens and the suburb of Palaio Faliron there was a string of arson attacks against banks and car dealerships, causing widespread damage but no injuries. There was also an attack against the offices of the Ministry for Development in the city center. Arsonists also targeted the car of Deputy Environment and Public Works Minister, Stavros Kaloyiannis, outside his home in the northwestern town of Ioannina, destroying the vehicle. The assailants doused the wheels of the parked car with flammable liquid before setting it alight, according to the fire service. =Aftermath= Bookstore in Athens after riots By Wednesday 31 December 2008 the occupation of Greek universities in Athens and Thessaloniki had ended and the administrative officials had begun assessing the cost of damage done during the occupation. On Thursday, 1 January 2009 arsonists attacked 10 banks and two car dealerships around Athens and Piraeus amidst the New Year celebrations. No injuries or arrests were reported by the police. The attacks caused minor damage. At least five arson attacks were also reported by police in Thessaloniki; earlier that day police also briefly clashed with protesters, and fired tear gas at rock throwing demonstrators. In the early morning of Monday, 5 January 2009 at least two masked gunmen fired over 20 rounds at a riot police unit guarding the Greek Ministry of Culture in central Athens, hitting a 21-year-old officer in the chest and groin. The officer had apparently spotted the gunmen and warned his colleagues shortly before he was hit. An automatic Kalashnikov rifle and an MP5 submachine gun were used in the attack, also a fragmentation grenade was used as a diversion as the perpetrators escaped. The wounded policeman, identified as Diamandis Matzounis, was in a critical, but stable, condition in hospital after six hours of surgery. Authorities said they had cordoned off the region around the site of the attack to collect evidence for forensic examination. At least 72 people were detained during the initial search for suspects. Police said ballistics tests showed the MP5 matched one used in a 30 April 2007, attack on a police station in Athens suburb Nea Ionia. That attack caused no injuries but was claimed by the far-left Revolutionary Struggle group. Police also said ballistics tests showed that a second weapon used on Monday, a Kalashnikov rifle, was used in the more recent attack on police, on 23 December 2008. On Wednesday 14 January 2009 Revolutionary Struggle sent a statement to the weekly satirical newspaper, To Pontiki. The statement said the group carried out 23 December shooting attack and the separate 5 January shooting at the police officers. By Monday, 19 January 2009 Diamantis Matzounis The 21-year-old police officer seriously injured in the attack of 5 January 2009 was removed from intensive care following an improvement in his condition. Doctors said Diamantis Mantzounis had to undergo two operations to staunch a stomach hemorrhage caused by a bullet wound, but he has managed to recuperate. On Friday, 9 January 2009 a long-planned education protest march took place in Athens. The rally was organized to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 murder of high school teacher Nikos Temponeras by the secretary of the Patras youth organization of the, back then, ruling New Democracy (Greece) party, participants said they protest against police repression, corrupt politicians, the education reform and a social system that offers little hope, it was one of two held in the capital but it was the only one that turned violent. The trouble began after the rally by several thousand schoolchildren, teachers and students had almost reached its end, near the entrance to University of Athens where it had started. When hooded youths broke away from the student march and threw stones and flares at riot police, who fired tear gas and flash grenades. The youths then turned on police, hurling rocks and flares. At one point a group of protesters tried to force their way into the rector's office and to occupy the central offices of the University of Athens. The occupation of the University's offices was obstructed by groups of students and academics. According to rector Christos Kittas, police officers did not ask for university immunity to be lifted so that they could gain access to the faculty. Clashes continued in the area which was closed to traffic and where hundreds of demonstrators remained for an hour. There were repeated police charges and several arrests were made.

The local student community—which formed the main body of protesters—had also been in significant turmoil since 2006, being opposed to a series of proposed laws regarding the reform of the country's education system. Many of the student demonstrations in relation to these laws in early 2007 turned violent and resulted in clashes with the police, though the perpetrators of the incidents of violence and vandalism, then as in December 2008, should not be necessarily identified with the students.

Athens Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis has expressed his condolences for the death of the 15-year-old boy, adding that festive events for Christmas in Syntagma Square will be suspended until further notice. Moreover, he assured the owners of damaged shops that they will be aided in restoring their damages, adding that he will propose the Municipal Committee be acquitted of municipal duties for 2009. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) attributed the killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos to the result of escalating authoritarianism, reinforcement of the suppression mechanisms and their action, the network of reactionary laws and the \\"Euro-terror laws\\" created by the governments of ND and PASOK. The KKE has stated that the riots and the destruction is the work of foreign agents acting as provocateurs. The leader of the KKE, Aleka Papariga, called for organized struggle against the main politics that it will be well guarded against suspicious command centers.

Criticism =Criticism of the Government= On 10 December the Communist Party of Greece's Central Committee released a written statement where they said that \\"an effort is being made by the bourgeoisie state, the ND government to utilise the blind violence of the hooded people, which we are witnessing mainly through the television channels, to check the swelling wave of discontent and popular intervention that is developing.\\" On 12 December, PASOK leader George Papandreou speaking before his party's political council members blamed the ruling New Democracy government for the recent violent street protests in Athens and other parts of the country. He held the government solely responsible for everything taking place in the country, stated that \\"the government itself is the problem\\" and called for early elections so that, the Greek people will be able to provide a clear mandate. On the same day, MP Adonis Georgiades of the Popular Orthodox Rally accused the political leadership of the Greek police for giving orders to the riot police not to intervene effectively to stop the riots at their initial stage. Also Popular Orthodox Rally proposed a project that anyone hooded should be arrested, to stop university asylum, ban protests and review the role of the army, in order to stop the riots. In a meeting with police labor unionists, Alekos Alavanos the parliamentary leader of the Coalition of the Radical Left criticised the government for using the riot police as their own \\"army\\", he also, asked for an inter-party committee to examine the responsibilities and rights of the Greek police, whereas Alexis Tsipras, current president of the Coalition of the Radical Left, declared that the situation is indeed very grim and that the Greek government needs to find solutions for the actual causes of this \\"new social phenomenon\\". =Criticism of the Coalition of the Radical Left= Aleka Papariga, Secretary General of the Communist Party of Greece, called the leadership of the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) to \\"stop patting the hooded rioters on the back\\". Georgios Karatzaferis, president of the Popular Orthodox Rally, also stated that \\"there are some political powers that are serious, and some that pat them on the back...\\". Alexis Tsipras, SYRIZA president, replied \\"we don't pat them on the back, and we don't take the role of the state's prosecutor either\\". He attacked the Communist Party, describing it as a conservative power that is disturbed when the youth spontaneously storm the streets. He also stated that the young people of the country have reached a deadlock, and this deadlock and their problems force them to the streets. Nikos Konstantopoulos, former SYRIZA chairman, spoke to a local radio station and criticised the present party leadership for not condemning the riots directly. On Thursday 11th, Georgios Karatzaferis referred to a press release of the newspaper \\"Adesmeutos Typos\\" which, he claimed, had an MP of the Coalition supporting \\"the terrorism\\" instead of condemning the riots. Alekos Alavanos replied that, \\"Some have lost sense of what they say and what antidemocratic consequences their sayings might bring\\". On Friday 12th, in the parliament, MPs of both ruling New Democracy and the PASOK opposition criticised SYRIZA for not condemning the riots, and for Alexis Tsipras's statement that \\"the struggle must be moved in the schools\\". On Sunday 15th, Alexis Tsipras current president of SYRIZA called an unscheduled press conference where he dismissed criticism and decried what he called \\"slanderous\\" statements against the recent protests, he also added that \\"Synaspismos and its affiliated Parliamentary group, SYRIZA, are in an ideological conflict with the hooded gangs, because violence brings forth violence and leads to an impasse\\". =Criticism of the media= 'Breaking news' bulletins and other mass media accounts of the shooting reported that an unprovoked attack had taken place against the police, favoring a narrative of 'riots in Exarcheia' that sidelined or trivialized the death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos. However, the existence of eyewitness video footage of the event and its circulation along with other alternative accounts on social media, changed the predominant perception from one of an (anarchist) attack against police officers in the 'notorious' neighborhood of Exarcheia to one of a 'rogue' policeman killing a kid. Nevertheless, media coverage uncritically reproduced the initial police report and persisted in promoting a flawed scenario of the events when the 'awkward facts' were clear to most people. On 9 December, a photographer working for the newspaper Eleftheros Typos, who had taken on 7 December some snap-shots of a policeman targeting protesters with his gun, was fired, as the paper's editor claimed he was responsible for the leakage of the photos in the Internet. The photographer claimed the photos were not any more in his possession in the time of the leak, said that the editor was unwilling to publish them and denounced his sack as an attempt of political censorship, while left-wing newspapers and websites noted the editor's pro-government stance during the riots. The same newspaper received harsh criticism for misquoting Isocrates in its front page of 10 December. On 13 December, the Greek National Council of Radio and Television alerted all radio and television stations throughout the country that they should be careful in how they broadcast the news about the riots. The Council informed the stations mainly of the necessity of not showing scenes of extreme violence (in ways that might be interpreted as encouraging extreme anti-social behavior), to avoid acting as if they were judicial authorities, and to avoid showing in public documents and other elements that might be the subject of legal proceedings. The Council noted that \\"there is danger of breaking the broadcasting laws by the way of presenting the latest events.\\" Financial consequences for the Greek economy After the first days of demonstrations and the presentation of the 2009 state budget that predicted solid economic growth in spite of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the spread of the Greek 10-year Government bonds had, by 12 December 2008, widened to 230 basis points against the corresponding German Government bonds (Bundesanleihen), a level that represents the highest level for the past nine years and the highest since the country entered the eurozone. This had an immediate effect on the cost of financing for Greece's government; these costs rose considerably as a higher yield had to be paid on any bonds it sold. In addition, and given the credit crisis prevalent at the time, this curtailed its ability to issue bonds at all since investors were more risk averse than normal. Additionally, on Wednesday, 17 December 2008, the credit rating agency Moody's declared it would put Greece's credit rating, already the lowest in the Eurozone at A1, off positive outlook if political and economic instability continued.

It is mostly based on the Islamic accounts of Solomon's prophetic life extracted from the Qur'an but it also draws upon parallels found in some Jewish texts.فیلمی برای فخر سینمای دینی Jahan news Plot Solomon is a wise prophet selected as the crown prince by his father King David (Dawud in Islamic texts) when he was 9. Following Prophet David's death, Solomon succeeds to the crown and God appoints him as a prophet. Requesting from God the establishment of a divine kingdom, Solomon takes the wind under his command and jinns and demons under his control. Inviting rulers of the neighbouring lands to the monotheistic religion, Prophet Solomon continues his divine mission in as much as Balqis, the Queen of Sheba professes monotheism. At the end, while leaning on his cane, Solomon bids farewell to the world, and the jinns and demons get out of reign and return to their own world. =Part one= Solomon, the prophet and king of Judah, asks God to grant him an ideal kingdom and a promised paradise not to be given to anyone until the end of the world. For this to be fulfilled, he should face the world of the devils (jinns and demons), their materialization, and an imminent and cruel war with them. Filled with disbelief and blasphemy, the heads of the different tribes of the Israelites reject his calls for help. When disaster strikes and the people get demonic and lunatic, barely can Solomon control the crisis. But as soon as the creatures take material form, he prays for God's help and favour to overcome their onslaught. So God helps him and the devils get scared of Prophet Solomon. =Part two= Filming of this part has not begun yet but its production and casting is under review: Solomon is announced by God in the Qur'an to have control over various elements, such as winds, to use them for different purposes including transportation. He travels to several territories and builds towers and monuments using the power of jinns. He also sets up a crystal palace in Jerusalem al-Quds. Then he meets the Queen of Sheba and, according to Islamic texts, introduces her into Islam (\\"submission to God\\").

The prosecution's theory was that HLF distributed charity through local zakat (charity) committees located in the West Bank that paid stipends to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and Hamas prisoners; that Hamas controlled those zakat committees; that by distributing charity through Hamas- controlled committees, HLF helped Hamas build a grassroots support amongst the Palestinian people; and that these charity front organizations served a dual purpose of laundering the money for all of Hamas's activities.REVISED January 13, 2012 \\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\\" United States of America vs Mohammad El-Mezain; Ghassan Elashi; Shukri Abu Bakr; Mufid Abdulqader; Abdulrahman Odeh; Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, also known as HLF. \\" No. 09-10560, Filed December 7, 2011, pg. 8 http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-10560-CR0.wpd.pdf Simultaneously, in November 2004, a U.S. Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys ruled that HLF, along with Hamas-linked organizations the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), were liable for a 1996 killing of 17-year-old David Boim in Israel. This decision was the first time U.S. citizens or organizations were held liable under a 1990 federal law that permitted victims of terrorism to sue for civil damages. The first trial, in 2007, ended in the partial acquittal of one defendant and a hung jury on all other charges. At a retrial in 2008, the jury found all defendants guilty on all counts.

May 28, 2009.  Designation as a terrorist organization  HLF, originally known as the Occupied Land Fund, was established by defendant Shukri Abu Baker in Indiana in 1988 as a tax-exempt charity. The organization was later incorporated by Baker, Ghassan Elashi, and Mohammad el-Mezain in California before being renamed as HLF. In 1992, HLF relocated to Richardson, Texas.REVISED January 13, 2012 \\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\\" United States of America vs Mohammad El-Mezain; Ghassan Elashi; Shukri Abu Bakr; Mufid Abdulqader; Abdulrahman Odeh; Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, also known as HLF. \\" No. 09-10560, Filed December 7, 2011, pg. 9 http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-10560-CR0.wpd.pdf It had offices in California, New Jersey, and Illinois, and individual representatives scattered throughout the US, the West Bank, and Gaza. Among the founders of HLF is Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook, a political leader of Hamas, who provided substantial funds to HLF in the early 1990s, before Hamas was designated a terrorist organization. During this time, the US government alleged that Marzook led Baker, el-Mezain, and Elashi to create other Hamas- supporting organizations in the United States, including media entity Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), and the United Association for Studies and Research (UASR). UASR's role was to publish papers and books about Hamas. Baker was also reportedly on IAP's board as well. HLF reported Marzook's donations on its tax returns. Marzook was deported from the US to Jordan in 1997. He was indicted on August 20, 2004, by a US federal grand jury in Chicago, Illinois. He and two other individuals were charged with a 15-year conspiracy to raise funds for terrorist attacks against Israel. Neither HLF nor any HLF officer was charged in the Chicago indictment. During the mid-90s, HLF distributed publications that stated HLF raised money for \\"widows, orphans, the homeless, and 'families of martyrs.\\" In addition, the group lauded the fact that it was the \\"first to aid the 413 suspected Hamas activists whom Israel deported to Lebanon in 1992.\\" HLF also listed Hamas- linked Islamic University of Gaza—also founded by Marzook—as one recipient of its aid. In response to allegations that HLF provided funds to a Jamil Hamami, who publicly identified as a senior Hamas leader, run school, Baker stated that this faith school was well respected. In 2000, HLF raised over $13 million. According to the United States Department of Treasury, HLF supported Hamas activities through direct fund transfers to its offices in the West Bank and Gaza that are affiliated with Hamas, and transfers of funds to Islamic charity committees (“zakat committees\\") and other charitable organizations that are part of Hamas or controlled by Hamas members. The Treasury Department also reported that HLF funds were used by Hamas to support schools that served Hamas's ends by encouraging children to become suicide bombers and to recruit suicide bombers by offering support to their families. Edward Abington, Jr., former U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, acted as a defense witness and testified that during his daily CIA briefings he had never been informed that Hamas controlled the Palestinian charity groups mentioned. The Treasury Department designated HLF a terrorist organization on December 4, 2001 under President Bush's Executive Order 13224 (Bush). The United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control designated HLF a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, while the European Union froze its European assets. Chronology of events Before the designation of HLF as a terrorist organization, the government had been surveilling the organization pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\\"FISA\\") as well as several individuals due to suspect activity. One month following the signing of the Oslo Accords, Baker and Elashi participated in a Philadelphia meeting in 1993 secretly recorded by the FBI. During this meeting, participants discussed their opposition to the Oslo Accords and their support of Hamas. Baker instructed that \\"if anyone should inquire about the purpose of the meeting, participants should explain that it was a 'joint workshop' between HLF and the IAP.\\"REVISED January 13, 2012 \\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\\" United States of America vs Mohammad El-Mezain; Ghassan Elashi; Shukri Abu Bakr; Mufid Abdulqader; Abdulrahman Odeh; Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, also known as HLF. \\" No. 09-10560, Filed December 7, 2011, pg. 11 http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-10560-CR0.wpd.pdf He also stated that participants should not refer to \\"samah\\" or Hamas spelled backwards explicitly, mentioning that it would be better for participants to obscure the meaning by saying \\"Sister Samah.\\" Following this meeting, in 1994 the government searched the houses of two unindicted co-conspirators, Ismail Elbarasse and Abdelhaleen Masan Ashqar, where they found numerous documents labeling HLF as a fundraising arm for Hamas. On December 4, 2001, following HLF's designation as a terrorist organization, the assets of the organization were frozen by the FBI and Treasury agents. Treasury officials conceded that a \\"substantial amount\\" of the money raised went to worthy causes, but insisted that Holy Land's primary purpose had been to subsidize Hamas. Treasury officials argued that HLF provided the following amounts to Hamas-controlled zakat committees from 1992 to 2001: $366,584 to the Tulkarem Zakat Committee; $1,674,954 to the Islamic Charitable Society of Hebron (“ICS Hebron”); $475,715 to the Nablus Zakat Committee; $554,500 to the Jenin Zakat Committee; $494,252 to the Ramallah Zakat Committee; and $295,187 to the Qalqilia Zakat Committee. In addition, HLF sent $485,468 to the Islamic Science and Culture Committee from May 1991 until the committee was closed in 1996.REVISED January 13, 2012 \\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\\" United States of America vs Mohammad El-Mezain; Ghassan Elashi; Shukri Abu Bakr; Mufid Abdulqader; Abdulrahman Odeh; Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, also known as HLF. \\" No. 09-10560, Filed December 7, 2011, pg. 10http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-10560-CR0.wpd.pdf Repeated appeals to the courts by HLF to have the freeze lifted failed. On July 3, 2007, Muslim Legal Fund of America agreed to fund the defense of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development against allegations by the government that the charity provided \\"material support\\" by providing basic necessities (i.e. food, clothing, shelter, etc.) for Palestinians under the Israeli occupation. On July 27, 2004, a federal grand jury in Dallas, Texas, returned a 42-count indictment against the Holy Land Foundation. Charges included: conspiracy, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, tax evasion, and money laundering. The indictment alleged that the Holy Land Foundation provided more than $12.4 million to individuals and organizations linked to Hamas from 1995 to 2001, when their assets were frozen. The indictment also named specific officers of the Holy Land Foundation: President Shukri Abu Baker; Chairman Ghassan Elashi; and Executive Director Haitham Maghawri, and four others: Mohammad el-Mezain, Akram Mishal, Mufid Abdulqader, and Abdulraham Odeh. Five of the seven were arrested. Maghawri and Mishal have not been found, and are considered fugitives. In December 2004, a federal judge in Chicago ruled that the Holy Land Foundation (along with the Islamic Association of Palestine and the Quranic Literacy Institute) was liable in a $156 million lawsuit for aiding and abetting the militant group Hamas in the death of a 17-year-old American citizen named David Boim. In 2007 this decision was reversed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago and sent back to the trial court. In 2008, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reheard the case en banc. On November 3, 2008, the 7th Circuit \\"upheld in large measure a $156 million award to the parents of David Boim, a 17-year-old U.S. citizen murdered by members of Hamas while visiting Israel.\\" \\"The en banc court agreed with [Washington Legal Foundation] that those who donate funds to a known terrorist group are responsible under U.S. law for the group's actions – even if the donors contend that they only intended to support the group's \\"humanitarian\\" activities.\\" \\"The court also rejected the 7th Circuit panel's conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to find Hamas was responsible the teenager's death.\\"  2007 trial  The first HLF criminal trial began on July 23, 2007, at the Earl Cabell Federal Building in Dallas, Texas.

Fish claimed that the defendants' access was already sufficient since they had personal access to all the declassified summaries of the FISA intercepts and to the four lines of FISA intercepts that were fully declassified. Their attorneys who possessed security clearances could also access all FISA intercepts the government produced.

Jonathen Fighel, and acting unit chief for the FBI's cryptanalysis and racketeering records unit Daniel B. Olsen. Olsen's testimony focused on Hamas' financial infrastructure, including their financial records and affiliated zakat committees. Levitt's testimony focused on Hamas' origins, leaders and prominent members, and structure. The government did not allege that HLF paid directly for suicide bombings, but instead that the foundation supported terrorism by sending more than $12 million to charitable groups, known as zakat or charity committees, which provide social goods and services. The prosecution said the committees were controlled by Hamas, and contributed to terrorism by helping Hamas spread its ideology, recruit supporters, and provide a front for laundering money and soliciting donations. Some of these charitable committees were still receiving US funding through the USAID program as late as 2006. Although none of the zakat committees were included on the Treasury Department list of designated terrorist organizations, the government alleged that HLF knew these charities were controlled by Hamas and acted as a branch of Hamas within the United States. Avi testified that the zakat committees were controlled by Hamas starting in 1991. Moreover, conversations captured from the Philadelphia meeting in 1993 had Hamas leader Muin Shabib discussing the zakat committees relationship to Hamas.

While 200 charges were filed against the defendants, the jurors had acquitted on some counts and were deadlocked on charges ranging from tax violations to providing material support for terrorists. One defendant was acquitted of most of the 32 charges against him. One juror mentioned that the panel found little evidence against three defendants and was split on charges against Baker and Elashi. The New York Times reported: \\"The decision today is 'a stunning setback for the government, there's no other way of looking at it,' said Matthew D. Orwig, a partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal who was, until recently, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas. 'This is a message, a two-by-four in the middle of the forehead,' Orwig said. 'If this doesn't get their attention, they are just in complete denial,' he said of Justice Department officials, who he said may not have recognized how difficult such cases are to prosecute.\\" Experts found the jury's inability to come to a definitive conclusion to be evidence of weakness in the government's ability to provide clear enough evidence against the charity. The LA Times reported that Georgetown University law professor David Cole said: \\"If the government can shut them down and then not convince a jury the group is guilty of any wrongdoing, then there is something wrong with the process\\".\\"Weak case seen in failed trial of charity; Muslim relief group was shut based on charges that ended in mistrial.\\", by Greg Krikorian, Los Angeles Times, November 4, 2007, p.

The prosecution again presented the two anonymous Israeli witnesses, \\"Avi\\" and \\"Major Lior.\\" In an effort to strengthen its unsuccessful presentation at the first trial, the prosecution added testimony from former National Security Council staff member Steven Simon, from Treasury Department official Robert McBrien, and from Mohamed Shorbagi, who had pleaded guilty to charges unrelated to HLF and was cooperating with the prosecution. The prosecution also placed into evidence documents that, according to \\"Major Lior,\\" the IDF had recovered from the Palestinian Authority headquarters in Ramallah during an IDF operation in 2002 known as \\"Operation Defensive Shield.\\" On November 24, 2008, the government obtained guilty verdicts on all counts against HLF and the five individual defendants in the retrial. HLF was found guilty of giving more than $12 million to support Hamas. The charges on which the jury found the defendants guilty included conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. \\"Today's verdicts are important milestones in America's efforts against financiers of terrorism,\\" Patrick Rowan, assistant attorney general for national security, said after the trial. \\"This prosecution demonstrates our resolve to ensure that humanitarian relief efforts are not used as a mechanism to disguise and enable support for terrorist groups.\\" The five convicted individuals were Ghassan Elashi, former CEO Shukri Abu-Baker, Mufid Abdulqader, Abdulrahman Odeh, and Mohammad El-Mezain. *Abu-Baker was sentenced to 65 years. *Elashi, also a member of the founding Board of Directors of the Texas branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), was sentenced to 65 years. *Mufid Abdulqader was sentenced to 20 years. *Abdelrahman Odeh was sentenced to 15 years. *El-Mezain, former endowments director, sentenced to 15 years. Because of the potential lengthy sentences for the criminal convictions, the individual defendants were remanded into custody without bail pending any appeal. A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit. The defendants appealed their convictions and sentences to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On December 7, 2011, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court found that the trial court had erred in admitting each of the additional items of evidence on which the prosecution relied in the second trial (the Simon testimony, the McBrien testimony, the Shorbagi testimony, and the documents recovered from the Palestinian Authority headquarters).Id. at 496, 499-501, 512, 516. But the court of appeals found that the errors in admitting this evidence were harmless (i.e., that the errors did not affect the outcome of the trial).Id. at 525-35. The defendants petitioned the court of appeals for rehearing. They contended that the four erroneously admitted items of evidence were the key differences between the first trial, where the jury did not return a single guilty verdict, and the second trial, where the jury returned guilty verdicts on every count.United States v. El-Mezain, No. 09-10560, Appellants' Joint Petition for Rehearing En Banc (filed Jan. 4, 2012). The court of appeals denied the petition for rehearing without comment.United States v. El-Mezain, No. 09-10560, Order Denying Petition for Rehearing (Feb. 17, 2012). In May 2012, Elashi, Baker, Abdulqader, and Odeh filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, challenging their convictions on Sixth Amendment grounds and thereby requesting that the high court review their convictions. The defendants asserted that the prosecution's use of two anonymous witnesses during their trial was impermissible as a matter of law. On October 29, 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari.Elashi v. United States, No. 11-1390, 133 S. Ct. 525 (2012) British barrister Francis FitzGibbon QC has called the second trial a 'show trial' which relied on 'untested and untestable evidence,' hearsay evidence, prejudicial evidence, and the showing to the jury of additional material which was not part of the evidence at all. These add up to 'patent failings and abuses in the legal process.'Low-Hanging Fruit - Francis FitzGibbon on the show trial of the Holy Land Foundation (January 2015), London Review of Books FitzGibbon also doubts the strength of the prosecution's case because, among other reasons, the United States Agency for International Development funded the same zakat committees named in the indictment of the HLF, and continued to do so for three years after it had shut down the HLF. However, Levitt claimed this was the result of a flawed vetting system. Until June 2006, USAID lacked important background identifier information on individuals such as date of birth and full names. According to a Government Accountability Office report, USAID lacked even a procedure to verify the accuracy of individual's names. In March 2006, the USAID mission to Tel Aviv eliminated a requirement to periodically reevaluate partners resulting in a lack of scrutiny for organizations later tied to terrorists. Finally, USAID did not vet recipients that received funds under $25,000 from 2001 to 2003 and under $100,000 post 2003 until 2006 when the threshold returned to $25,000.

Biography and career Vanderbilt was born on 9 August 1935 in San Fernando, Trinidad, moving to the United Kingdom in the late 1950s. In 1964 he signed his first record deal using the stage name, \\"Ebony Keyes\\", with Parlophone Records, releasing two songs, \\"Brother Joe\\" and \\"Under the Apple Tree\\". In 1967, after an introduction from his friend Peter Gage (a founder of Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band and Vinegar Joe), he signed to Pye Records where he released a number of singles on the Pye Label; on their subsidiary record label Piccadilly Records and on the label of their primary Australian distributor, Astor Records. The records included: \\"If Our Love Should End\\"; \\"Sitting in a Ring\\"; \\"Country Girl\\"; \\"Cupid's House\\"; \\"How Many Times\\"; \\"Don't\\"; \\"Sweet Mary Anne (Sweeter Than a Rose)\\"; and the hit “If You Knew”. In 1968, he signed to the United Artists Record Label when, at the suggestion of an A&R; executive, he changed his stage name from Ebony Keyes to \\"Lee Vanderbilt\\". While with United Artists he released a number of singles and sang on a number of film sound tracks including the theme song, Some Girls Do, for the 1969 British spy-spoof of the same name, directed by Ralph Thomas and starring Richard Johnson. \\"Some Girls Do\\" was released by United Artists as a single in 1969. In the same year Vanderbilt was asked to represent the United Kingdom at the Gibraltar Song Festival, where he won gold and bronze medals with two songs of his own composition, \\"How shall I Know\\" and \\"A Woman's Way\\".  The 1970s and onwards  In the 1970s, Vanderbilt was regularly in the studio, working as a session musician. Through his session work he met many artists with whom he would go on to collaborate including an aspiring musical arranger, producer and songwriter from India called Biddu Appaiah (also known simply as Biddu). Biddu and Vanderbilt became friends and collaborated for many years on a number of projects. In 1973, Biddu established his own production company to which he signed a number of artists, including Vanderbilt. The first commercially successful artist signed to Biddu's production company was Carl Douglas, who in 1974 released his well-known disco hit \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\". Carl Douglas also recorded three songs written by Lee Vanderbilt, \\"I Don't Care What the People Say\\" (Biddu-Vanderbilt), \\"Stand Up For Love\\" and \\"Never Had This Dream Before\\", all three of which appeared on his \\"Kung Fu Fighter\\" Album in 1974. In 1976, Vanderbilt introduced his friend Tina Charles to Biddu, who Biddu signed and for whom he produced a number of worldwide hits including a single released in 1976 called \\"I Love to Love\\". The B-side of that single was a song written by Vanderbilt called \\"Disco Fever\\". Tina Charles also recorded Vanderbilt's song \\"All Comes Back to You\\" on her 1976 Album \\"Dance Little Lady\\". \\"Jimmy James and the Vagabonds\\" also signed to Biddu's production company. Jimmy James recorded a number of Vanderbilt's songs including: “Disco Fever”, “Never had this Dream Before”,\\"Let's Have Fun\\", \\"Suspicious Love\\" (Biddu/Vanderbilt) and a fifth song called “If You Think that Funk is Junk Your Drunk”. Biddu also had success with his own group known as the Biddu Orchestra. The Biddu Orchestra comprised a group of session musicians with whom Biddu and Vanderbilt had worked for many years. Biddu recorded two songs with the Biddu Orchestra written by Vanderbilt, “Funky Tropical” (which appeared both on his album \\"Eastern Man\\" and which he released as a single in 1977) and “Jump for Joy”. Vanderbilt was also a backing vocalists for the Biddu Orchestra. In 1977, Vanderbilt released his own album on the RCA Record label called Get Into What You're In. The songs on the album reflect his many musical influences, including funk numbers like \\"Funky Tropical\\" and \\"Show me What you Made Off\\"; soulful love song like \\"Coral Isle\\" and \\"Stand Up for Love\\"; and caribbeanesque number like \\"Sweet Ices\\" and \\"What a Way\\". The Album was produced by Biddu but did not achieve as much commercial success as it did critical acclaim. In addition to releasing his own album, working with artists as a session singer and percussionist and collaborating with Biddu and the other artists signed to Biddu’s production company, in the 70s, Lee Vanderbilt performed a song, written by George Barrie and Sammy Cahn, called \\"The Night Has Many Eyes\\", for the 1973 film Night Watch starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. The song was released as a single in 1973 on the Brut Record label. He wrote the theme music for the UK comedy movie Black Joy (performed by Jimmy Helms) released in 1977 and starring Norman Beaton, Trevor Thomas and Floella Benjamin; and wrote and performed a song called \\"Lonely I\\" for the same movie. During the 1970s he also sang a number of well-known and award- winning television commercials, including the Martini Hot Air Balloon Commercial; Tia Maria's \\"Get it Together\\" commercial; and one of Lilt's \\"Totally Tropical Taste\\" commercials. Some other artists with whom Vanderbilt has worked are Edwyn Collins; Elkie Brooks; Joan Armatrading; George Chandler, Jimmy Helms, Jimmy Cambers (all founding members of the successful UK group Londonbeat); Anthony Moore; Barclay James Harvest; and Bryn Haworth. Lee Vanderbilt lived and worked in the United Kingdom until his death in February 2015, from a severe bout of pneumonia. He leaves behind four sons, one of whom is an attorney living in New York, two of whom are recording artists, Gary Des-Etages and Christopher \\"Tambu\\" Herbert and the fourth, Gabrial Kennedy who lives and works in London.

He differed in important ways from the Calvinism with which he is associated, particularly concerning the doctrines of grace and predestination. The unusual nature of his own Protestant Christianity has been characterized as both Puritan and Independent.Milton's Religious Context Theological political writings =Church government= After the start of the Bishops’ Wars, a movement was started calling for the disestablishment of the Church of England and the religious hierarchy. Milton joined in on a pamphlet war that soon followed and produced his antiprelatical tracts. These pamphlets emphasize the need for an individual to be exposed to scripture without any interference from a church government or from a fixed liturgy that could possibly corrupt the individual.Wheeler 2003 p. 265–275 =Divorce laws= Milton married in Spring 1642 but his wife soon left him. The legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce and he began examining the legitimacy of divorce.Miller 1974 p. 3 Milton was motivated towards writing on the topic after reading a work of Martin Bucer that emphasized the scriptural legitimacy of divorce.Patterson 2003 p. 279 After publishing his divorce pamphlets, especially after Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Milton developed a reputation as both a divorcer and a polygamist.Miller 1974 p. 122 Eventually, Milton believed that a translation of Bucer's work, published as Judgement of Martin Bucer Concerning Divorce, would convince Parliament of the truth behind his previous tract on divorce, but this did not happen.Patterson 2003 p. 287 He continued to pursue the topic until his wife returned to him and their marriage was reconciled.Miller 1974 pp. 3–4 =Paradise Lost= Paradise Lost is Milton's epic depiction of the Fall of Man. In the story, Adam and Eve are warned against the evils of Satan and are told of the war in Heaven in which Satan challenged God's throne and was cast down in punishment. Satan, in order to get revenge against God, tempts Eve into eating of the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and Adam, out of love, joins with her in the disobedience so she will not be blamed alone. God punishes them by casting them out of Eden and exposing them to the pain of the world, but he promises them that his Son will descend and bring about their salvation. =Paradise Regained= Paradise Regained follows Paradise Lost; also an epic, it retells the Temptation of Christ. Much shorter than its predecessor, It places the Son, incarnated as Christ, against Satan who tries to tempt Christ and to discover who he is, but he is unable to before he finally gives up and Christ defeats him. =Samson Agonistes= Milton's last work, Samson Agonistes is a closet drama based on the format of Greek tragedy, and describes the Biblical story of Samson. When Samson is betrayed and blinded, he calls upon God to use him one more time to effect his will and exact revenge upon God's enemies. Religious Views =On the soul= Milton believed in the idea of soul sleeping or mortalism, which determines that the soul, upon death, is in a sleep like state until the Last Judgment.Rumrich 2003 p. 142 Similarly, he believed that Christ, when incarnated, merged his divine and human identities, and that both of these identities died during his Crucifixion.Barker 1942 p. 319 With such views on the nature of the human body and the soul, there is no possibility of a state of existence between death and the resurrection, and concepts such as Purgatory are outright denied. However, these views are not standard Calvinistic interpretations, but his views on what happens after the resurrection are orthodox Calvinistic doctrine: Christ, during the resurrection, would raise man up higher than the state he was in before the fall.McDill 1942 pp. 333–334 =Religious toleration= John Milton called in the Areopagitica for \\"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\\". \\"Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel.\\"Hunter, William Bridges A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8(East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980) pp. 71, 72 Notes References * Barker, Arthur.

The arched entrance-way in the c1900 photo of Lululaund. Dining room, 'Human Sympathy', a frieze in painted relief. c 1901 Lululaund was the Romanesque Revival-style house and studio of German-born British artist Hubert von Herkomer, in Melbourne Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire. It was designed in c.1886 and inhabited in 1894. It was demolished in 1939.Lululaund Victorian Web , 23 February 2011 The exterior design was developed from a sketch by the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson and was the only example of his work in Europe. It was an influence on the work of English architect Charles Harrison Townsend. Design In the 1880s, von Herkomer had travelled to America twice to paint portraits and to give lectures. In early 1886, he painted the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson in exchange for a home design he could bring back to Britain. Richardson, at the peak of his career and only months before his death at age 47, sketched a single picture of a four-storey Romanesque castle, explicitly allowing Herkomer to change the exterior \\"at will\\". From this sketch, von Herkomer commissioned the house. Herkomer's father and two of his three uncles contributed to the idea, which was honoured by the artist in the triptych The Makers of my House. His uncle John, a joiner and carver, as was Herkomer's father Lorenz, came from America to assist, and his uncle Anton, a weaver, provided the draperies designed by the artist. The house was built in white tufa from Bavaria and red sandstone. A plinth of courses of rugged stone formed the lower level, above was a wide segmental arch across most of the frontage and this was framed by two round turreted towers. At the top was a patterned gable. A tower rising above the front door was truncated during its construction when von Herkomer discovered it would obstruct light into his studio. Herkomer was solely responsible for the design of the interiors. The rooms were in German gothic style, extravagantly decorated with elaborate wood carvings executed by himself and members of his family. The principal bedroom had a copper ceiling and had wood carved walls entirely covered with gold leaf. The hall and staircase were lined with panels of redwood, three feet wide and 30 feet high. The dining room was decorated with a relief frieze of nude female figures, illustrating Human Sympathy. It was illuminated by concealed electric lights, an innovation for its time. The drawing room had a vast arched chimney-piece and a music gallery . The house was, for its time, built to a very high technical standard, had for instance electricity from its own generator (in a sidehouse), as well as hot and cold water in each bedroom.Lost Lululaund Gavin Stamp, Appolo Magazine , 28 November 2008. At google cache History Herkomer named the house Lululaund after his deceased wife, Lulu, who had died from a heart attack in 1885. The architect, Richardson, also died, long before the house was completed. Von Herkomer lived in the house from its completion in 1894 until his death in 1914. Lululaund was nicknamed the 'Bavarian castle' by Bushey residents. Listing for the garden contains a history of the house. Herkomer built a theatre in the grounds where he staged ‘pictorial-music- plays’ that he partly wrote and designed himself. When Herkomer became a pioneer of cinematography the theatre was later turned into a film studio and cinema, and he directed and acted in several films that were released commercially. In the 1880s Herkomer created an Art School. After he retired from the school, the building was demolished, although the school continued on another site under the direction of Lucy Kemp-Welch. The landscape architect Thomas Mawson was commissioned in 1913 to design a rose garden on the original site. When Herkomer died in 1914, his third wife, Margaret, Lady Herkomer, sister of his second wife, Lulu Griffiths, the house's namesake, moved out of Lululaund to another property nearby. Lululaund was requisitioned during the First World War, but subsequently remained largely unoccupied. The house and the film studio were leased in 1915 by the British Actors Film Company for use as their principal production base. The company ran into financial difficulties in the early 1920s and closed the site in 1923. The film boom of the 1930s caused it to reopen the studio, making short films. During the 1920s and 1930s the surrounding estate land was gradually broken-up and sold for development. The buildings largely fell into disuse. For a number of years the house became the haunt of tramps, courting couples and schoolboys.Lost Lululaund Lady Herkomer died in 1934, and the trustees of the Herkomer Estate offered the house, rose garden and kitchen garden to Bushey Urban District Council. The house was refused due to the high cost of maintenance but in 1937 the rose garden was transferred to the ownership of the Council. Lululaund was almost completely demolished in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, with only a remnant surviving. It is possible that anti-German feeling and the fear it was an elevated landmark and a navigational marker for enemy bombers influenced the decision. Much of the masonry from the demolition went as hardcore to build Bovingdon Airfield in 1941.Bushey Rose Garden - descriptive leaflet Hertsmere Borough Council, 2010 Films continued to be made in the studio until 1985 when it too closed. A small portion of Richardson's façade survived: the front door and its tympanum, as the entrance to the former local British Legion hall on Melbourne Road. The hall is being redeveloped into housing in 2014, but the doorway is being retained. The rose garden, summer- house, sunken garden and pergola were preserved and are now public gardens known as the Bushey Rose Garden. Quotations Herkomer wrote in the 1911 second volume of his autobiography : \\"Completed it is not, nor would I wish to feel that the last touch had been put to it. It should still have the possibility of growth, otherwise expectancy would cease, and with it life's greatest stimulant.\\"PDF His biographer, Baldry, wrote in 1901 : \\"There has been in existence in his family for some generations an idea that there should be erected some day a house which would be at the same time a memorial of the Herkomers and a record of the work that they had done in the world.\\" p.103.

The halt, which can happen a few times a day per security if FINRA deems it, usually lasts for one hour, but is not limited to that. Trading halts can happen any time of day. The listed company is supposed to call the exchange where it is listed, 10 minutes prior to any material news that they are releasing, in order for the exchange to halt the stock before the news is released. The first 5 minutes of a halt is for \\"news pending\\" before any information is released that could affect a stock significantly, also known as the \\"5 minute window\\". Trading halts usually occur when a publicly traded company is going to release significant news about itself. The halt in trading for the affected security gives investors time to review the news and assess its impact. Another situation in which a trading halt might occur is when the exchange is uncertain \\"whether the security continues to meet the market’s listing standards.\\" Note, there are also \\"trading pauses\\", which are defined as, under NASDAQ, \\"if a security is subject to a Trading Pause, the Pause Threshold Price field will contain the reference threshold price that deviates 10% from a print on the Consolidated Tape that is last sale eligible as compared to every print in that security on a rolling five (5) minute basis\\".  Regulatory and non- regulatory trading halts  Both of the reasons mentioned above are \\"regulatory\\" trading halts and are implemented on many major stock exchanges (for example, the NYSE American, NASDAQ, and New York Stock Exchange). When a United States exchange enacts a regulatory halt for a security, other U.S. exchanges that also trade the security will honor the halt. The NASDAQ and other exchanges currently use 11 codes to specify in more detail why trading has been halted for a security. The Over The Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) currently uses 5 codes. A \\"non-regulatory\\" trading halt occurs if \\"significant order imbalance between buyers and sellers in a security\\" exist. (The NASDAQ stock exchange does not implement non-regulatory trading halts.) Before trading resumes, market specialists must determine an appropriate price range in which the security can trade. Unlike regulatory halts, other U.S. exchanges do not always stop trading a security affected by a non-regulatory halt. NASDAQ OMX (owner of the NASDAQ stock market) displays current trading halts for the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange, along with a rolling 21-day history. The OTCBB maintains its own trading halt list and a rolling 6-month history.  Trading suspension  A trading suspension occurs when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stops trading for a specific security because of \\"serious questions ... about a company’s assets, operations, or other financial information.\\" Note that in this case, it is the SEC -- not the exchange -- stopping the security from being traded. On its web site, the SEC maintains a list of trading suspensions going back to 1995.

It was the first independent motion picture production company in the United States. In 1909 the company added a West Coast production unit, the Nestor Film Company, which established the first permanent film studio in Hollywood, California, in 1911. The company was absorbed by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912. History The Centaur Film Company was the first independent motion picture production company in the United States. It was formed in 1907 by David Horsley, operator of a successful bicycle business and pool parlor in Bayonne, New Jersey, with his brother William Horsley and Charles Gorman, a screenwriter for the Biograph Company. The company's first production was The Cowboy's Escape, a one-reel short film released September 15, 1908. In 1910 Gorman sold his interest in the company back to the Horsleys, and William Horsley—a silent partner for Centaur's first three years—assumed an active role running the company's laboratory. Cinematographer Charles Rosher, who went to work for Centaur in 1909 recalled, \\"Well, I won't call it a studio. It was really nothing but a shop, with a lot of bathtubs for developing the film. They used to go out and make pictures with an improvised camera—an infringement of the Motion Picture Patents Company. This brought the Horsleys into the patents war, and they became the first independent producers.\\" Actors working for Centaur included Francis Ford, who joined the company around 1908 and inspired his younger brother John Ford to also enter the film industry. Motion picture industry pioneer Al Christie began his filmmaking career at Centaur in 1909. By 1910, the operation was producing three movies a week, including the Mutt and Jeff comedies. =West Coast unit= \\"However, weather conditions on the east coast made filming an uncertain proposition because camera technology at the time relied on sunshine.\\" \\"Frustrated, and realizing that California afforded the opportunity to make films year round, David Horsley moved his operations to the west coast.\\" =Nestor Motion Picture Company= Centaur changed its name to Nestor Motion Picture Company after its West Coast production unit, and in the fall of 1911 it opened the first motion picture studio in Hollywood, in the Blondeau Tavern building at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. With Horsley was Al Christie, who served as general manager in charge of Christie Comedies, plus Charles Rosher, who lent his expertise as the studio's full-time cameraman. =Merger with Universal Pictures= In 1912 the Horsley Brothers, along with other independents, notably Carl Laemmle and his Independent Motion Picture Company, known as IMP, and Swanson and Ed Porter founded Universal Picture Company, succeeded in defeating the monopolistic hold on the industry of the Patents Company and General Film Company, in what was known at the time as the Latham Loop controversy. Nestor Studio and Nestor Ranch ranch location were renamed by Carl Laemmle, becoming Universal Studios and the Universal Ranch (First Universal City) - see \\"Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills Film History\\" Nestor Studios name appeared on 844 films, from The Blazed Trail (1910) - Nestor Film Company to Ain't Nature Wonderful?

By 1915 Universal completed the move of its operations (Nestor/ Universal ranch and studio) to the new Universal City (Lankershim), The Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street studio continued as the production location for Nestor Comedies ( Nestor production unit). In 1916 the Oak Crest/Nestor/Universal ranch is leased by Lasky. The Lasky/Famous Players/Paramount Ranch remained as filming location until 1926. Hollywood Film Enterprises - Bill Horsley Laboratory In 1916 William Horsley withdrew from the Universal company and set up the Bill Horsley Laboratory, later known as Hollywood Film Enterprises, Inc., devoted exclusively to the developing and printing of 35 mm. films. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Hollywood Film Enterprises diversified its activities into the 16mm and 8mm \\"home movie\\" area. During those years, they were the exclusive distributor of Walt Disney's cartoons in 8mm and 16mm for home movie and \\"toy\\" projectors. HFE also at various times offered Walter Lantz and Hugh Harman- Rudolf Ising cartoons as well; along with home movie reels of Laurel and Hardy, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, various Hal Roach and Al Christie comedies, and a Tarzan series edited from a silent era serial.

The name derives from the characteristic shape of the stand. The harp stand was typically used in conjunction with the stub switch. It remained in use longest among narrow gauge railroads such as the Denver & Rio Grande well into the 20th century. The harp mechanism was a simple lever which pivoted on an axle pin located midway up the main body (the \\"frame\\") of the stand. The upper part of the lever passed through a slot atop the stand. A signal target was usually attached at the top of the lever. The lower end of the lever extended below the main body of the stand where it attached to a bar. Pulling on the lever would pull this bar which in turn would move the rail into the desired position. The lever was sometimes secured by notches along the slot at the top of the stand. Variations of this basic design were common. Harp stands were of two types: a two-position and a three-position, for use with two-way and three-way turnouts, respectively.

He served as a Deputy in the National Assembly of Senegal from 1983 to 2004, as Mayor of Rufisque from 1987 to 2002, and as President of the Council of the Republic for Economic and Social Affairs (CRAES) from 2004 to 2007. He was a long-time member of the Socialist Party (PS), but split from the PS to form his own party, the Party for Progress and Citizenship (PPC), in 2000, before merging that party into the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) two years later. Biography =Early career= Diop was born in Rufisque in 1936\\"Who's Who\\", Africa Intelligence , Sénégal: Les Hommes de Pouvoir n°5, 17 July 2001 . and joined the Youth Movement of the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1954Cheikh Yérim Seck, \\"Mbaye-Jacques Diop\\", Jeune Afrique, 24 February 2008 . as a founding member. He became the Secretary-General for Organization and Propaganda of the Youth Union of the Senegalese Popular Bloc in 1957; after the Bloc was transformed into the Senegalese Progressive Union, he continued to hold the same post in its youth movement until 1964. Additionally, he was successively a member of the Political Bureau of the Bloc and then the Senegalese Progressive Union from 1957 to 1967. At the Cotonou congress of the African Regroupment Party in July 1958, Diop was a delegate representing the youth of Senegal; he was subsequently the Secretary for Foreign Relations of the National Youth Union of Mali from 1959 to 1960. He was first elected as a municipal councillor in Rufisque in 1964 and was continuously re-elected during the subsequent decades. Later, Diop was the Director of the PS Cadre School, which he founded, from 1975 to 1980; also during that period, he was Coordinator of the PS Study and Reflection Group (GER) from 1976 to 1978 and was Permanent Secretary of the PS Political Bureau from 1977 to 1980. He was the Secretary-General of the PS Communal Coordination from 1982 to 1990. Diop was elected to the National Assembly in the 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998 elections as a PS candidate; he also became Mayor of Rufisque in 1987 and was Vice-President of the Association of Mayors of Senegal from 1988 to 2002. Additionally, he held the posts of Secretary-General of the PS Regional Union in Dakar and First Vice-President of the Urban Community of Dakar from 1990 to 2000. In the National Assembly, Diop was President of the Laws and Human Rights Commission from 1996 to 2000 and President of the Defense and Security Commission from 2000 to 2001. =Party split= Shortly before the first round of the 2000 presidential election, violence broke out between supporters of the PS and the opposition in Rufisque on 23 February 2000; there were six injuries, and two homes owned by Diop were set on fire. He described it as \\"a grave sign for democracy in Senegal\\".\\"Police, army try to head off election violence in Senegal\\", Associated Press (nl.newsbank.com), 25 February 2000. After the first round, Diop resigned from the PS on 2 March 2000, choosing to support opposition candidate Abdoulaye Wade against the incumbent president and PS candidate Abdou DioufMbaye-Jacques Diop, \\"Droit de réponse\\", Jeune Afrique, 25 September 2005 . and joining a pro-Wade alliance, the Front for the Alternance. According to Diop, his defection \\"dealt a severe political, electoral and psychological blow to the PS and its candidate, Abdou Diouf\\", who was defeated by Wade in the second round. He then founded a new party, the PPC, on 30 May 2000, becoming its Secretary-General. Subsequently, he was elected to the National Assembly as a PPC candidate through national list proportional representation in the April 2001 parliamentary election; he was the only PPC candidate to win a seat., gouv.sn . The PPC merged itself into Wade's party, the PDS, on 20 May 2002; Diop became National Political Secretary of the PDS at that time. Also in 2002, Diop left his position as Mayor of Rufisque, becoming Honorary Mayor instead. He joined the National Political Administration of the PDS in May 2003 and joined the PDS Steering Committee in May 2004. Wade then appointed Diop as President of the CRAES when that body was created in August 2004.Cheikh Yérim Seck, \\"Wade règle ses comptes\\", Jeune Afrique, 9 December 2007 . Diop also became President of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie in June 2007. On 1 October 2007, Wade asked Diop to resign from his position as President of the CRAES, while stressing that he did not have a dispute with Diop and did not want to start one. Diop was unwilling to resign, however, saying that he had done nothing wrong and that people would not understand if he left his post prior to the end of his five-year term in August 2009. On 4 October, when Diop was preparing to travel to a meeting of the Union of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions of La Francophonie, Wade barred him from leaving the country. After Iba Der Thiam mediated the situation, Diop agreed to resign on 16 November, but Wade nevertheless criticized Diop at a meeting of the PDS Steering Committee, saying that he had wasted 300 million CFA francs on \\"whimisical missions\\". Wade dissolved the CRAES on 21 November 2007 and established a new Economic and Social Council in its place. On 13 February 2008, the Grand Marabout of the Mourides, Serigne Mouhamadou Lamine Bara Mbacké, asked Diop to return from Paris to meet with Wade in Dakar on 14 February. Wade and Diop accordingly met at the presidential palace and discussed the reasons for Wade's dissolution of the CRAES. On this occasion, Wade complained that Diop had failed to campaign for him in the February 2007 presidential election, while Diop said that he had created a slogan supporting Wade's candidacy and that he had toured the regional capitals to speak in support of Wade's candidacy. Wade also said that he had heard that Diop had boasted that Wade could not act against him; Diop replied that he could not simultaneously support Wade's re-election and defy his authority. Wade told Diop that he no longer had any complaint against him, \\"especially as my marabout asks it of me\\". Diop subsequently went to Touba to thank the Grand Marabout for his intervention on 16 February.Cheikh Yérim Seck, \\"Réconciliation tous azimuts\\", Jeune Afrique, 24 February 2008 . Diop said on 16 September 2009 that he did not favor moves to eliminate the two- round system for presidential elections, arguing that it would be less democratic to decide the outcome in a single round. He nevertheless expressed his firm support for President Wade's planned 2012 re-election bid.\\"Mbaye Jacques Diop s’oppose à la suppression du second tour au Sénégal\\", Pressafrik.com, 17 September 2009 .

It was the former location of Silver High School before the current location of Silver High School was built. History Silver City, was founded in 1870. The first public school opened in 1874. On February 11, 1893, when the Thirtieth Session of the Territorial Legislature of New Mexico passed \\"An Act to Establish and Provide for the Maintenance and Government of the Normal Schools of New Mexico.\\" The location of the school was chosen on a hill so that people coming to town could see the school clearly. Old Silver High School before destruction, 1982In 1918, the first high school was opened, and was part of the Normal School. In the 1920s, the New Mexico Normal School became the New Mexico State Teachers' College. The regents made the High School a separate department of the school. In 1926, the high school became the Grant County High School. The school became accredited in 1934. Because of increasing population growth in the area, the old facilities were no longer accommodatable. Plans to create a new high school were being drawn up in 1937. The Chamber of Commerce and local governments proposed creating a new high school that could accommodate 600 students. Governor Tingley, the governor of New Mexico at the time, approved the sale of bonds to get the project started. In 1949, State Teachers College became New Mexico Western College. At the same time, the name of the high school was changed to Western High. Because the funding of the high school, in 1939, was by a legislative appropriation by a Silver City bond issue, a suit found that the University should transfer the title of the building and furnishings to the Silver City School District and cease to operate it.\\"NM Supreme Court Upholds High School Title Decision\\", Silver City Daily Press, April 6, 1965, Page 1.

In 1965, the school had become overcrowded to the point that split sessions were required. In 1966, the present high school building was built on 32nd and Silver streets. The old school building remained vacant and was used for various activities. Demolition The building was purchased by Neil Parrish and Larry Phifer to develop the building into apartments. During the reroofing project, it was determined that there was significant water damage to the building. The amount of money required to renovate the building was astronomical. Demolition activities began, but because the building was so well built, the demolition activities proved difficult. The building stood partially demolished until 1983. The university repurchased the building and completed the demolition. The concrete stairs leading up to the former building can still be seen today.

Frank Baum, the author best known for his Oz books. It was published under the pen name \\"Schuyler Staunton\\", one of Baum's several pseudonyms.\\"Schulyer Staunton\\", The Fate of a Crown, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1905. (Baum arrived at the name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle Schuyler Stanton.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 135.) Audience In the years just before and after 1900, Baum had established himself as a successful author of children's books. He then set out to expand his audience in three potentially lucrative areas: adult fiction and juvenile fiction for girls and for boys. The Fate of a Crown was his first endeavor for the adult audience. In 1906 he published Annabel and Aunt Jane's Nieces, juvenile novels for girls, and Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, a book for boys. (Each of these books was issued under a different pseudonym.) In The Fate of a Crown, Baum wrote an adventure novel that combines elements of political intrigue, melodrama, and mystery story. He set the book in Brazil in 1889, during the revolution that brought the Empire of Brazil to its end. Baum chose the rather daring strategy of including major historical figures of the period, Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca,The Fate of a Crown, pp. 97–105, 134–140. Floriano Peixoto,The Fate of a Crown, pp. 135–140, 183–186, 189–193. and even Emperor Pedro II,The Fate of a Crown, pp. 160–188. as characters in his fiction. (This may have been an additional good reason for releasing the novel under a pen name.) Story The novel's protagonist is a young American named Robert Harcliffe; a recent college graduate, he works for his family's mercantile business in New Orleans, run by his Uncle Nelson. Nelson Harcliffe receives a letter from an old client in Brazil, Dom Miguel de Pintra, a wealthy man who has retired from business to devote himself to politics – specifically to the republican cause that struggles to replace the Brazilian Empire. Dom Miguel has written to request a secretary; Robert, eager for adventure, agrees to take the job. Robert's attitude is devil-may-care at first, yet he quickly learns that he has entered into a dangerous enterprise. He cleverly evades a murderous spy on the voyage down to Rio de Janeiro; but as soon as he reaches the city he is arrested by the police. In the carriage taking him to the police station, the lieutenant in charge is murdered by his own sergeant, who is a republican sympathizer. The sergeant and other sympathizers guide Harcliffe to the city of Cuyaba in Matto Grosso state, and to Dom Miguel's plantation. There, Harcliffe quickly becomes a devoted admirer of de Pintra and a republican sympathizer himself. (Baum presents this as an American's natural preference, over the archaic, authoritarian, European imperial system.) Just as quickly, Robert learns that the circle around the republican leader is fraught with uncertainty. The man's daughter Izabel is cold and suspect, while his ward Lesba is an ardent republican, and a beauty with whom Harcliffe soon falls in love. Lesba's brother appears to be a republican too – yet he serves as the Emperor's minister of police. Harcliffe wrestles with question of who can be trusted, and who is playing a \\"double game\\". The mystery aspects of the story center on the massive steel vault, impregnated with nitro glycerin, that is hidden in a sub-basement of de Pintra's mansion. It holds the treasury and the incriminating records of the republican movement; it opens with an exotic key, a specially-cut emerald in Dom Miguel's ring. The ring is stolen, which leads Harcliffe on a challenging and puzzling chase. As the revolution starts, Dom Miguel, Harcliffe, and other supporters are captured and face a firing squad, only to be rescued (some of them at least) at the last minute, by Lesba and a troop of rebels. When the rebellion succeeds, Harcliffe marries Lesba and becomes the director of commerce in the new regime. The couple raise their children in a cosmopolitan style, wintering in New Orleans and spending the rest of the year in Brazil. Baum's first adult novel was successful enough to justify a follow-up effort: a second Schuyler Staunton book, Daughters of Destiny, was issued in 1906. A third adult novel, The Last Egyptian, followed. The Fate of a Crown was reprinted in a paperback edition in 2008.L. Frank Baum, The Fate of a Crown, Whitefish, MT, Kessinger Publishing Co., 2008.

King, which focuses on the adventures of Russell and her partner and, later, husband, an aging Sherlock Holmes. The author's website includes an excerpt from the first chapter. Timeline The events in the book take place between January and March 1924, starting a few weeks after the events of Justice Hall. Plot Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes are visited by Sherlock's gravely ill brother, Mycroft, who has an intriguing case for them. Mycroft, who has connections in the highest levels of the government, has just received a strange package: An oilskin-wrapped packet containing the papers of a missing English spy named Kimball O'Hara. Mary quickly realises that this is the same Kimball who served as the inspiration for the famous Rudyard Kipling novel, an orphaned English boy turned loose in India, whose cunning he used to spy for the Crown. But now, he has inexplicably gone missing. Mycroft fears that he may have been taken hostage or even killed. When Russell learns of that Holmes knew Kim thirty years before, she knows the die is cast: she will accompany her husband to India to search for the missing operative. En route, they encounter the insufferable Tom Goodheart—a wealthy young American who has embraced Communism—traveling with his mother and sister to visit his maharaja friend, Jumalpandra (\\"Jimmy\\"), an impossibly rich and charming ruler of the (fictional) Indian state of Khanpur. Even before they arrive, danger shows its face in everything from a suspicious passenger on board their steamer to an \\"accident\\" that very nearly claims their lives. With some local intelligence supplied by Geoffrey Nesbit, an English agent taught by Kim, and accompanied by Bindra, a resourceful orphan, the couple travel incognito as native magicians.

Birth and education Moshe Levy was born on December 8, 1927 in Thessaloniki, Greece. In 1933 his father, Eliyahu, decided to immigrate to Palestine, then under British occupation. He grew up in the southern part of Tel-Aviv and attended the Alliance Elementary School and the Balfour High School. After graduating from high school, he went to work as a laboratory assistant at the Zeiff Institute in Rehovot. There, with the help of Chaim Weizmann (later the first president of the State of Israel) he obtained a scholarship to attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shortly after enrolling at the Hebrew University, he was called, as a member of the Haganah, to fight in the Israeli War of Independence in Jerusalem, and only returned to the university in September 1949. He received a master's degree in Physical Chemistry in 1952. He finished his Ph.D. in 1955 after two years at the College of Forestry, State University of New York, Syracuse, SUNY-ESF, under the supervision of Michael Szwarc. He has been married to Joan Dvora Sugerman since 1955, and has two children, Sharona T. Levy and Alon Yitzchak Halevy, and has four grandchildren, Danielle and Itamar Menuhin, and Karina and Kasper Halevy. He lived in Rehovot, Israel. Academic career As a post-doctoral fellow under Michael Szwarc, Moshe Levy was a member of the team who discovered \\"Living Polymers\\", which was a major breakthrough in the field of polymers science. The work was published as a one-page communication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Michael Szwarc received the Kyoto Prize for this work in 1987, acknowledging Moshe Levy for many of the breakthroughs leading to it. After a few years at the Technion and another year as a research fellow in Syracuse, he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Rehovot, Israel. At the Weizmann Institute, he initially worked with Aharon Katzir, and later moved to the Plastics Research Department, which he headed from 1977 to 1983. In 1982 he started working on solar energy. His work focused on creating a chemical reaction that enables storing the energy produced by the sun so it can be transported to a user site, and then (after the reverse reaction) be used upon request. With several colleagues, he built the solar tower at the Weizmann Institute that is a center for solar-energy research. In 1993 he became an emeritus professor, but has remained active in research and service, including serving as the president of the Israeli Polymer and Plastics Society in 1993–1995 and editor of the bulletin of the Israeli Chemical Society, Chemistry in Israel. Moshe Levy has also spent time as a visiting scientist in a number of institutions, including Xerox Research Center (Rochester, New York), DuPont Central Research Center (Wilmington, Delaware), the University of Florida at Gainesville, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

A lifelong reformist, he was murdered under suspicious circumstances. Early life Ishii graduated from Chuo University, where he studied the legal educations and the graduate school of Waseda University. During the student time, he has participated in Student activism. Ishii lived in the Soviet Union for 6 years as an international student to Lomonosov Moscow State University, following the recommendation by Yasushi Akutagawa, Representative of Japan-Soviet Union Youth Friendship Committee at that time. There he majored theory of state and law under the guidance of Professor A. Y. Denisov and earned a doctorate in philosophy. Political career After coming back from Moscow, Ishii started his political activity at the Socialist Democratic Federation (Japan) (SDF). In 1992 he defected from the SDF, entered the Japan New Party and was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in 1993. Ishii was the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of the Management and Coordination Agency under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Even though he was elected from Japan New Party, Ishii broke with Morihiro Hosokawa and did not enter the New Frontier Party. After being the member of the Liberal League and the New Party Sakigake, Ishii participated in the formation of the DPJ in 1996. Ishii's career in the Diet was marked by his fieldwork concerning waste in government spending. He utilized the investigative function of the diet and heading an anticorruption task force known as the \\"G-Men Squad\\" within the DPJ. In November 1997, Ishii uncovered malfeasance in the Central Procurement Office of the Ministry of Defense, which has led to a criminal investigation by the Tokyo Local Public Prosecutors Office. The investigation revealed government waste of over 2 trillion yen per year. Ishii's proposals were as follows: # To reduce the power of amakudari companies, to collect the capital paid by the Government and the assets increased, and to return them to the people. (His investigation revealed that there exists more than 3,000 such companies in Japan) # To strengthen the powers of the Board of Audit. # To reduce the use of keiretsu companies (large public–private partnerships that form horizontal conglomerates) and re-allocate contracts to private small and medium-sized enterprises. In 1999, Ishii formed a bipartisan group in the Diet to track Aum Shinrikyo members.\\"Diet group tries to crack down on AUM activities\\" The Rick A.

(around $25 million US) =Final year in the Diet= In 2002, Ishii intensified his investigations into the Japanese budget and proposed that the real government spending of the Japanese Government is about 200 trillion yen, much of which was being concealed from the public. Masajuro Shiokawa, the Finance Minister at that time, refused to comment, claiming that Ishii was merely expressing an opinion. Spurned by the legislative process, Ishii wrote a book about his discoveries, Japan's Secret Checkbook: The Truth about the Financial Interests That Will Destroy the Nation (2002). It was published by a small alternative press. Murder On 25 October 2002, Ishii was stabbed to death by Ito Hakusui, a Yamaguchi-gumi gangster. Ishii was the third Japanese politician murdered after the end of World War II. Ito escaped down the road covered in blood in broad daylight and fled to the mountains without being noticed, but surrendered himself the next day.

Hosaka wrote on his blog that the police squad in charge of the murder did not do even simple things like swabbing for fingerprints, and that Ishii's diary also went missing at some point after his murder. For Hosaka, the single most disturbing thing is that reporters had called him asking about Ito immediately after the murder, a full day before any suspects had been announced.

Life and career Evenepoel first studied art in Brussels at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts between 1889 and 1890, and entered Paris's Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1892. Evenepoel entered the atelier of Gustave Moreau in 1893, which put him in contact with Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, Albert Marquet, Edgar Maxence, Charles Milcendeau, and Léon Printemps. The artist debuted a portrait of his cousin (Louise in Mourning) at the 1894 Salon des Artistes Français. He showed four portraits at the Salon du Champ-de-Mars in 1895 and continued to exhibit there until his death. His first solo exhibition came at the Brussels Cercle Artistique (December 1897 – January 1898). Family and friends were the artist's preferred subjects; his full-length portraits, often against a neutral background, show the influence of Édouard Manet and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. His Parisian scenes were influenced by Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec and Jean-Louis Forain. Though his early scenes had a somber palette, his paintings while in Algeria (where he first wintered during his solo exhibition) were very different in style, anticipating the bold colours of Fauvism (e.g., Orange Market, Blidah).

It lies within the county of Schwalm-Eder- Kreis in Hesse, Germany. Its neighbouring municipalities are: Lembach (part of the municipality of Homberg) to the southeast, Borken to the southwest, Gombeth to the northwest and Lendorf to the east.  History  Singlis lies at the point where the Gilsbach stream, coming from Pfaffenhausen, empties into the Schwalm. It is an ancient settlement whose roots reach back to the early Stone Age. It is first documented, like Großenenglis, in 775 in the Breviarium sancti Lulli. In the centuries that followed, the House of Züschen, a local noble family, thrived and amassed considerable wealth. In 1265, the family sold their estates in Singlis together with all their trappings, including the mill and the court in Singlis and Nordwig, to the monastery at Haina. The monastery turned their new estate, with about 55 morgens of land, into one of its most important farms. As a result of the Reformation and the monastery's consequent dissolution, its farm in Singlis, along with its income, was assigned to the University of Marburg. The farm was put into the care of a landgravial vogt and was called the Universitäts-Vogtei Singlis (\\"Singlis University Vogtei\\"). In the middle of the 19th century, the farm was sold and, later, elements were sold off to various farmers in Singlis. In 1578, the village belonged to the Amt of Borken and at the time had about 52 households. After a drop in population, like much of Central Europe caused by the Thirty Years' War, it was not until the early 19th century that the population once again reached its former level. Today, Singlis has 909 inhabitants. The church's current location was presumably the centre of settlement in the early Middle Ages. The land there is roughly 2 m higher than that around it, keeping it well above most floodwater. A church was first mentioned in 1265 when the Züschens sold the monastery their landholdings. The church that stands today was built between 1700 and 1710 as a simple hall and has since been comprehensively renovated several times, the latest work being carried out in 1971. Since then, the bell tower has stood to the north next to the church. Since the Reformation, Singlis has been the seat of a parish and has an affiliated church in Lendorf. Singlis's Schwalmmühle – Mill on the Schwalm – was first mentioned in 1266. At that time it lay immediately on the Schwalm, that is to say, where the river Gilsbach joins it today. Only in 1508 was a millstream dug and the mill moved to its present site. From then until 1977, the mill was owned by the Wagner and Nöll families. In 1807, the writer Ernst Koch was born in Singlis. PreussenElektra, its new owner, shut the mill down, at least as a grist mill, but to this day they still use it to generate electricity, which is fed into the grid. The 503-hectare rural area was also affected by brown coal strip mining from 1960 to 1972. The former strip mine with the name \\"Singlis\\" lay just west of the village and is nowadays a pond 70 hectares in area.

It started operations in 2014. It is one of the largest gas storages in Europe. Technical features The gas storage uses a depleted gas reservoir. The working volume of the gas storage will be 4.1 billion cubic meters (bcm) and a volume of cushion gas would be 4.6 bcm. The gas storage will include 14 new wells to a depth of , of pipeline and the gas treatment facility. The gas treatment and compression facilities are being designed as a zero-emissions plant. The project is expected to cost €800 million excluding the cost of cushion gas. In August 2009, Gazprom Export—the export unit of Gazprom—was contracted to supply the project's cushion gas in exchange for gas storage services and a participating interest in operations of the facility. The final investment decision was made in October 2009. Assuming all permits are obtained, construction will start in mid-2010 with drilling of the 14 new wells expected to start in 2011. Commercial operations will start due to resistance of local city councils in 2014 at the earliest. Project company The Bergermeer project consortium consists of TAQA Energy B.V. (a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company), Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN), Dyas B.V. and Suncor. The facility will be operated by TAQA Energy. Environmental constraints A number of scientific reportsSeismic hazard van geïnduceerde aardbevingenTechnical review of Bergermeer Seismicity study, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009 however show that gas storage might bring about serious seismic hazard to the surrounding municipalities of Bergen, Heiloo and Schermer and the town of Alkmaar. The area has known a number of (man) induced earthquakes during the depletion of the field between 1994 and 2008, with subsequent higher magnitudes on the Richter scale. Scientists from a number of renowned scientific institutes such as KNMI, MIT and TNO are comfortable with an estimated maximum magnitude of 3,9 on the Richter scale, with a chance of occurrence of 2% over the concession period. Earthquakes with lower magnitude but still quite damaging are of a much higher likelihood.

Frank Baum, the author famous for his series of books on the Land of Oz. The book was issued under the pen name \\"Suzanne Metcalf,\\" one of Baum's various pseudonyms.\\"Suzanne Metcalf,\\" Annabel: A Novel for Young Folk, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1906. Annabel was one of Baum's first efforts to write a novel for adolescent girls – who soon became one of his most important audiences. Literary markets In the years around 1900, Baum had established himself as a successful author of children's literature, most notably with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In the middle of the twentieth century's first decade, he worked to expand his reach into three other potentially lucrative markets. He published his first adult novel, The Fate of a Crown, in 1905. In 1906 came Annabel, plus Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, Baum's first book for adolescent boys. (Each of these books was released under a different pseudonym. The prolific Baum had learned from earlier experience that he ended up \\"competing with himself\\" if he issued too much material in his own name in a short period of time. As Reilly & Britton's star author, it was also important that he make it appear that the company published more authors than they did.) Annabel, however, was apparently not the breakthrough that the author and his publisher might have hoped for. The novel is a \\"Horatio Alger- type story in which a virtuous vegetable-peddler discovers that his supposedly dead father is alive and rich....\\"Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 138. Baum drives the story with multiple coincidences, and ties them together at the end with a nod to God's providence. \\"Apparently the book did not catch on, for its author, 'Suzanne Metcalf,' produced no more.\\"Rogers, p. 139. Still, the book was popular enough to be reprinted in a second edition. The original edition of Annabel featured illustrations by H. Putnam Hall. In the second edition of 1912, these were replaced with a new set of pictures by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens, who illustrated other Baum works, The Flying Girl, Phoebe Daring, and The Flying Girl and Her Chum, in 1911 and 1912. Also in 1906, Baum's Aunt Jane's Nieces (by \\"Edith Van Dyne\\") proved to be a popular hit, and launched a series of ten novels for girls that was one of Baum's major successes. He followed that with his The Bluebird Books, another successful series of the same type. Synopsis Will Carden, the novel's protagonist, is fifteen years old at the start of the story. His family has \\"come down\\" in the world: though his late father had once owned a steel mill, Will and his mother and siblings now survive by growing vegetables on a two-acre plot of land. Will is popular with the local children, especially with the five Williams siblings who live in the big house in the town of Bingham. Of the five, Mary LouiseBaum had a favored sister named Mary Louise, which explains his repeated use of the name in his works. is the beauty; her twelve-year-old sister Annabel is plain in comparison, with red hair and freckles and a \\"pug nose.\\" Their father owns the steel mill that succeeded the Carden mill as the town's leading employer; their mother, the snobbish Mrs. Williams, wounds Will by telling her children to avoid the lowly \\"vegetable boy.\\" Will, however, is a lad of fine character; he is encouraged by the local physician, Dr. Meigs, who joins the Carden family in a mushroom-growing business that relieves their poverty. Will saves Annabel's life when she falls through a frozen pond while ice-skating. Annabel and Will grow close as Annabel blossoms into young womanhood; Meigs encourages her steel-magnate father to acknowledge and encourage the boy. Meigs and Williams also become suspicious of Ezra Jordan, the man who manages Williams's mill and boards with the Cardens. Jordan was crucial in the Carden family's history; the doctor and steel-man realize that all knowledge of the death of Will's father has filtered through Jordan. Upon investigation, they learn that Jordan has cheated both Williams and the Cardens, by appropriating a valuable steel-making process developed by the elder Carden. It turns out that Mr. Carden is alive and well in Britain, where he has made his fortune. Jordan has worked a double fraud: he deceived the Cardens in Bingham into believing that their husband and father had died in a shipwreck – and he also tricked Carden in England into thinking that his family had perished in an epidemic. Jordan maintained his lodging with the family precisely to intercept any possible communications that would reveal his nefarious scheme. Once all of the facts are revealed, the Carden family is united in prosperity once more. Will and Annabel look forward to marriage and the prospect of a happy union. \\\\---- Annabel was included in the sixth and final issue of the annual Oz-story Magazine in 2000, with the illustrations of both Hall and Nuyttens.David Maxine, ed., Oz-story Magazine No. 6 (September 2000), pp. 182-222.

The company is led by CEO Leif Helth Jensen, who is, together with Michael Forer and Florian Schönharting, also member of the Board of Directors. Rose Pharma is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel treatments for IBS and anorexia/cachexia associated with cancer and other major pathologies.  History  Rose Pharma was formerly known as Gastrotech Pharma and founded in 2003. It has a core interest in gastroenterology and was initially established to exploit novel peptide hormones regulating GI and nutritional function. Rose Pharma currently works mainly in the research and development of its main drug, ROSE-010.  Products  ROSE-010 is a pharmaceutical therapy intended to treat pain symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. The pharmaceutical, ROSE-010 mimics the hormone GLP-1 which modulates smooth muscle contractions and thus reduces spasms associated with IBS. ROSE-010 must be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. A phase II double-blinded placebo controlled trial in Europe demonstrated efficacy of this approach, and a phase I/II trial in the US established the safety of this concept also in IBS patients with predominant constipation. These clinical data, together with the preclinical data generated by Rose Pharma, provide the rationale for this peptide hormone based therapy for acute pain attacks in IBS.  Partnerships  Rose Pharma is currently funded by CAT Invest, Nordic Biotech, BML Healthcare and 123MultiNova Europe. In 2008, Rose Pharma signed an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, USA) to in-license a Lilly compound (formerly known as LY307161, now named ROSE-010), an analogue of the naturally occurring intestinal hormone GLP-1. The licensing agreement is a result of an ongoing research collaboration the two companies have participated in since 2004.

Eugene was born in Birmingham. His father had a small shop in Great Hampton Street in Birmingham selling and making bicycles and fittings. Eugene began working as an apprentice making motorcycles at New Hudson. Inspired by their father, he and his brother Percy set up New Veloce Motors Limited at Spring Hill in Birmingham and began making motor cars in 1908. Their father was experimenting with a new motorcycle engine design and commissioned the engines to be made by his sons, while he went on to develop the frames and cycle parts at his works in Fleet Street, Birmingham. In 1909 they had a working prototype 276cc four stroke which had many innovative design features. The motorcycle market was very much in its infancy, however and sales were poor so he decided to produce a 499cc belt drive model to bring in some much needed cash. In 1916 Eugene's car making business failed and he joined Veloce, the family firm. In 1913, the company first used the trade name Velocette for a small two stroke motorcycle invented by Percy, and the name was then used for many later cycles as well. Production was halted by the outbreak of the First World War and the factory was turned over to the production of munitions for the war effort. Velocette KSS 350 1947 After the war the company name was changed to Velocette as this had become a recognised brand. In 1925 Goodman had a breakthrough when his 348cc overhead cam prototype was entered in the Isle of Man TT, which was one of the most famous road races of the time and a great 'proving ground' for motorcycle manufacturers. In 1926 Alec Bennet won the TT on a Velocette KTT. For the next forty-five years a series of very successful motorcycles followed. In 1971 rising development costs and the owners' racing expenses took their toll on the company's bottom line and they went into voluntary liquidation.

Murray was born in Sydney, and attended Lakemba Primary School, Canterbury Boys High School and Enmore Boys High School. He studied teaching at Sydney Teachers College and the University of Sydney, and went on to teach at Finley High School, Ashfield Boys High School and Picnic Point High School. He was also involved in local politics, serving as an alderman on Drummoyne Municipal Council from 1973 to 1983, including four years as mayor, and serving as a councillor on the Sydney County Council from 1980 to 1984. Murray was involved in local branch politics, and won Labor preselection to contest the local seat of Drummoyne at a 1982 by-election caused by the resignation of sitting MLA Michael Maher to enter federal politics. He was easily elected, as Drummoyne was considered a safe Labor seat, and re-elected five more times. He served as Shadow Minister for Local Government while Labor was in opposition, and when Labor won office in 1995, was appointed Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, holding the office until his retirement in 2003. Even though Murray became Speaker as a result of his party holding majority government, Liberal Opposition Leader Peter Collins made issue of Murray's election as Speaker, saying that Murray's election was illegal since some ALP members showed their ballot papers to each other, which contravened recent changes to the Constitution. Leader of the House, Paul Whelan, said Collins had not raised an objection at the time of the ballot.

Directed by Andrzej Celiński and Hanna Polak, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. Plot A text at the beginning of the film states that since the fall of the Soviet Union, between 1 and 4 million Russian children have become homeless and about 30,000 of them live around the Moscow railway stations. The film follows a group of children between the ages of eight and 14 during their daily lives at Leningradsky railway station. One boy, Misha, says his father didn't accept him as his son so he was brought to an orphanage at age two. Roma, who is 12, stabbed his father twice in the stomach because his parents would get drunk and beat him and a 14-year-old girl. Yula recalls how she was raped at age eleven but her mother accepted money instead of going to court and took to drugs, after which Yula left home. Sergiozha and his brothers seek shelter on the hot-water pipes in the sewers over the winter while others sleep in the trains or in the station. Most of the girls and some of the boys take to prostitution to make money for food, clothes and glue. All them are addicted to sniffing glue, they drink vodka during the day and sometimes sleep in rundown empty houses. A policeman beats a young boy and dumps a bottle of glue over his head and face. The children pick fights with homeless adults whom they despise and call bums. They tell that another child was raped and murdered and how the policemen beat them and held them for 48 hours although they had nothing to do with it. One of the last scenes shows the emotional funeral of a young girl, Tanya, that died from a glue overdose one day before her fourteenth birthday . The film closes with 13-year-old Misha saying \\"God believes in people and helps them. He loves everyone, even bad people, not just Russians. He even loves Chechnyans. But most of all, He loves children.\\" References External links * 2005 films 2005 documentary films Polish films Russian-language films Polish documentary films Polish short films Documentary films about Russia Documentary films about street children Films shot in Moscow Russian children Short documentary films ","title":"The Children of Leningradsky"},{"id":"20579093","text":"University of Agricultural Sciences could refer to one of two state agriculture universities in India started on the land grant university pattern. * University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad * University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore ","title":"University of Agricultural Sciences"},{"id":"20579097","text":"Walcott Inlet is an estuary located in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

Spleen is a world-weary comedian who is forced to make ends meet by hosting corporate events. Character profile Rick is a short-tempered, impatient comedian who struggles to find worthwhile gigs or appearances. He spends a lot of his time writing jokes for corporate events with his friend and writer, Marty who always does far more work than Rick. He lives in a typical London suburb house with partner Mel and daughter Sam. He is a stubborn, incompetent liar, who often attempts to avoid paying professionals by performing a task himself. He also passes off many of Marty's jokes as his own, and always aims to take credit for other people's work. In episode 2 of Season 3, \\"Panda\\", it is revealed that Spleen's real name is Richard Shaw, which caused him much grief at school due to it being shortened to 'rickshaw,' after the Chinese/Japanese transport Rickshaw. Dee and Sinclair have said that they based the character of Spleen on \\"comedians who hated being comedians\\" with whom Dee performed as he was starting his career as a stand-up comic.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/16/mondaymediasection8 Guardian article Relationships with other characters =Marty= Spleen often makes fun and insults his American writer Marty, and Marty returns the gesture. However, it is made clear that the two are great friends, despite their on-going bickering. How much the pair need each other is made especially obvious in the final episode of Season 2, \\"Lucky\\", where, after Spleen accuses him of lacking ambition, Marty receives a call from America asking him to write in Hollywood. Spleen is upset but tries not to let his feelings show. However, Marty returns and decides to continue writing with Spleen. Marty often acts as 'the good guy' when Rick sets off on his usual activity of insulting people. For example, when Spleen has an argument with Michael, the café owner, or with Magda, his Eastern-European cleaner, Marty defends them rather than backing Spleen, which appears to wind him up even more. =Mel= Mel, who works as an agent for TV performers, and Rick are partners and have a teenage daughter, Sam. However, Rick still lies to Mel to make himself look better, for example in \\"₤5,000\\", after Rick is detained by police for aggravating an officer, he claims that he was \\"being too funny\\". It appears that Mel is the only character who understands Rick, and accepts his ways, often agreeing with him or humouring him. =Magda= Rick barely tolerates the family's Eastern-European cleaner Magda. He often piles a lot of work on her and then takes the credit, for example in the season one episode \\"Fatty\\", Rick tells Magda to return a lost cat and then keeps the reward. Rick regularly gets into arguments with Magda and blames her often. He also treats her as slightly less human than everyone else, as she is from a less developed ex-Communist country, and constantly corrects her accented pronunciation of everyday words such as \\"sale\\" in which she says \\"sell\\" and \\"unhappy\\" when she says \\"unhippy.\\" In the first two episodes of Series 3, Magda has to stay in Rick's house, much to Rick's dismay. He constantly complains of her making noise, filling the fridge with her food and the fact that she has placed a fridgemagnet on the fridge amongst other things. In the series 3 episode \\"Karma\\", Rick is kind to Magda, which unnerves her. However, at the end of the episode he falls back into his ways of arguing with her. =Michael= Michael, owner of the local cafe, annoys Rick often. Michael sees Rick as a friend, however Rick does not return the sentiment. Rick often calls Michael mad, especially after he starts therapy. Rick accidentally injures Michael in the episode \\"£5,000\\", when he drives into him in his car. This results in Michael not being able to take part in the sponsored skip. In series 3, after Mel drunkenly reveals Michael's father is gay, Rick and Marty go to Michael's home to check up on him, a gesture Michael appreciates. =Ben and Sam= Sam, Rick's daughter, and Ben, her boyfriend, often irritate Rick by asking for money from him and then wasting it. Ben annoys Rick the most, for example when he breaks Rick's DVD player after taking the back cover off and thereby breaking the security seal thus invalidating the warranty. In series 3, Ben stays at Rick's home for an episode. Rick is annoyed by the constant loud music coming from Sam's room, as they practice for their band, 'Ben and Sam.' However, when it is revealed that an advertising agency wants to use the duo's song \\"Tragic\\", which was put up on YouTube, Rick changes his mind and starts enjoying the music. Ben and Sam temporarily broke up in the fourth episode of series 3, which also ended their band's run.

He previously played for FC Den Bosch, Telstar, Heracles Almelo, Genk, FC Twente, Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C, Go Ahead Eagles Zulte Waregem and Alanyaspor. Club career =Telstar= In the 2009–10 season, Plet was one of the revelations in the Dutch second division. Partly because of the many goals he made for the club, Telstar won the period title for the first time in years. The then 23-year-old striker played 73 league matches for Telstar, scoring 39 goals. =Heracles Almelo= On 27 May 2010, Glynor Plet signed a contract for three years with an option for another year with Heracles Almelo to succeed Bas Dost, who had left to SC Heerenveen. Glynor Plet scored two goals for Heracles on his Eredivsie debut against Willem II in a 3–0 home victory on 7 August 2010. He scored a total of 7 goals in 22 matches in his first season for the club.

In 2014, it merged with BioAlliance Pharma and is now part of Onxeo. It was founded in 2000 by a group of clinicians. TopoTarget was involved in collaborations with both academia and industry. In 2001 they began collaborating with the National Cancer Institute, a component of the US National Institutes of Health. Since their acquisition of Prolifix, they have been collaborating with the Netherlands Cancer Institute. They also collaborate with Rigshospitalet, the national hospital of Denmark. TopoTarget has also collaborated with other companies, including Novartis since 2003, and Lundbeck as of October 2007; Topotarget has been member of the Danish Innovation Network Biopeople since 2005. Company profile In 2007, TopoTarget's revenue was 44,890,000 DKK. The company is publicly traded on the OMX Nordic Exchange in Copenhagen under the symbol TOPO. They are a member of Medicon Valley Alliance. The CEO is Peter Buhl Jensen, M.D., PhD =Personnel= At the end of 2007, TopoTarget had a total of 146 employees who worked in drug development (including assay development, medicinal chemistry, preclinical research, and clinical trials), marketing, and sales. About 58% of employees are in medical and research fields. TopoTarget has public partners in many areas of the world, notably at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Frankfurt University Hospital, Oxford University Hospital, and the National Cancer Institute, US =History= TopoTarget was founded in 2000 by clinicians specializing in the molecular mechanisms of cancer. Since its start it has grown mostly through acquisitions of other companies. In 2002, TopoTarget acquired Prolifix Ltd. based in the United Kingdom. This was followed by the purchase of G2M Cancer Drugs AG in Germany in 2005. By 2006 TopoTarget had 125 employees specializing in most areas of drug discovery and development. In 2007, they acquired Apoxis, which has two products, APO010 and APO866. TopoTarget currently employs 146 people in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, UK and the USA. Currently TopoTarget has nine drugs in clinical development, as well as an extensive portfolio of small molecule drug candidates in the pre-clinical phase. Savene/Totect, TopoTarget's first marketed product was released in October 2006 in Europe and October 2007 in the United States causing a large jump in revenue from 2 million DKK in 2006 to 19 million DKK in 2007. In 2007, 293 patients were treated via drugs from TopoTarget's pipeline. =Collaborative research and business strategy= Since its inception in 2000, TopoTarget has developed a strong, two-pronged strategy for expanding its drug portfolio. TopoTarget splits its focus between in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities to maximize its utilization of available skills and resources. In-licensing takes advantage of internal talent and focuses on preclinical and early clinical development of small molecule drugs through Phase I trials. Out-licensing of its products to larger pharmaceutical companies, however, facilitates the progression of drugs with broad market potential through the final stages of clinical development, regulatory approval, and marketing by taking advantage of their established reputations and knacks for navigating the later stages of commercialization. To summarize its strategy, TopoTarget states: Allowing each sector to focus on its specialty in the drug development timeline maximizes TopoTarget's use of time and resources to increase productivity. A number of in-licensing collaborations have expanded TopoTarget's drug pipeline. In June 2004, TopoTarget entered a licensing and collaboration agreement with CuraGen Corporation with respect to research, development, and commercialization of a group of small molecules that inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. One of these drugs—Belinostat—has proved particularly promising and forms the basis of TopoTarget's research collaboration with the National Cancer Institute in the USA. In October 2005, Astellas sold them the exclusive worldwide license for a group of compounds with potential anti-cancer or immuno-suppressive activity which are currently undergoing further preclinical evaluation. LEO Pharma sold TopoTarget the license to its preclinical HDAC inhibitor, which is also undergoing evaluation as a treatment for cancer and inflammatory conditions. As of April 2008, all sales rights for this compound were transferred to TopoTarget. In October 2007, H Lundbeck A/S sold the development rights for their sigma receptor ligand, Siramesine. By licensing potential cancer therapeutics from external sources and developing drug candidates from within, TopoTarget hopes to establish a broad array of drugs that target the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer. Once the viability of a compound has been established internally, TopoTarget relays the remaining responsibilities of the development process to its commercial collaborators in out-licensing agreements. Three prominent bodies maintain such out-licensing contracts: the National Cancer Institute (USA), the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and Righospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark). TopoTarget has been working with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at NCI since 2001 to develop new anti-cancer agents. Currently, NCI is handling the clinical development of TopoTarget's HDAC inhibitor Belinostat (PXD101). NCI's efforts are focused on determining the molecular basis of Belinostat's anti-cancer activity and the drug's viability in combination drug therapy. The Netherlands Cancer Institute provides TopoTarget access to the extensive research conducted by the Division of Carcinogenesis, which uses advanced techniques in functional genomics to identify novel genes with roles in carcinogenesis. May 2003 saw the establishment of a five-year research collaboration agreement between TopoTarget and Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet to test the drug Topotect for effectiveness against brain metastases. Such relationships allow TopoTarget to advance its products through clinical development where its immediate resources are insufficient for the task. Products TopoTarget's portfolio included Belinostat, Savicol, Baceca, Avugane, APO866, TopotectA, Zemab, APO010, HSP90 Inhibitors, APO200. =Marketed= Savene Savene (aka Totect) is TopoTarget's single marketed drug as of the end of 2008., p. 14 The generic name for Savene is dexrazoxane.PubChem: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=6918223&loc;=ec_rcs Savene was developed by TopoTarget and authorized to be put on the market in July 2007 by the European Commission for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation. Savene, developed by TopoTarget is used for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation, a rare complication to chemotherapy. Anthracycline extravasation is defined as the unintentional installation or leakage into the perivascular or subcutaneous spaces during administration. Savene works by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II, which is the target of anthracycline chemotherapy. The drug binds to DNA topoisomerase II at a different step in the catalytic cycle than anthracyclines, which locks the enzyme in a conformational form that is no longer affected by anthracyclines. The drug is delivered as a ready-to-use kit containing both Savene powder and Savene diluents., pp. 12-13; N.B. The abstract is available without charge; full text requires login credentials. =In clinical development= Belinostat Belinostat (PXD101), p. 15 is TopoTarget's lead product that is currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Belinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). TopoTarget expects to launch an initial regulatory study using Belinostat as monotherapy to treat peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) by the beginning of 2009. In October 2007 preliminary results were released from the Phase II clinical trial of intravenous belinostat in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for relapsed ovarian cancer. Final results in late 2009 of a phase II trial for T cell lymphoma were encouraging. Belinostat has been granted orphan drug and fast track designation by the FDA. , belinostat is in a phase II pivotal trial with NDA submission planned for 2011H2. Savicol Savicol, formerly known as PEAC (Pulse Enhanced ACetylation), is an anti-cancer drug candidate that treats familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Savicol delivers valproic acid as a proprietary, which builds up on a specific pharmacokinetic release pattern that is projected to inhibit certain HDAC enzymes in a more efficient manner. Savicol has been entered into Phase II studies by TopoTarget for the treatment of colorectal polyps in FAP patients. Orphan drug status has been granted to Savicol in both the United States and in Europe. Baceca Baceca comprises a topical formulation of valproic acid (VPA) for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases, including basal cell carcinoma and pre-cancerous actinic keratosis. VPA primarily targets HDAC class I enzymes that are involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Baceca is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Avugane Avugane is a novel proprietary formulation of the HDACi VPA that has the potential to be used as a topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases including common acne. Randomized Phase II clinical studies were performed with Avugane in April 2006 and further studies have been conducted since then to investigate the clinical utility of the drug. If the results are successful, TopoTarget may consider conduction trials on other diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. TopotectA TopotectA is a topoisomerase II inhibitor for the treatment of brain metastases. This drug is based on the same compound as Savene (dexrazoxane) and is currently involved in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of brain metastases, which are a common secondary condition to patients that have lung cancer and breast cancer. Zemab Zemab comprises an antibody-toxin for the treatment of specific types of cancers in the form of a protein product., pg 20 The recombinant protein product targets the ErbB2/HER2 receptor, which is overexpressed in 30% of breast cancer and is often a marker of a more aggressive disease. This receptor is also believed to be involved in certain other cancers, including head and neck cancers. The next clinical studies of Zemab were expected to be initiated by the start of 2009. but no clinical trials were registered.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Zemab APO010 APO010, also known as mega-FasLigand is a recombinant fusion protein. This protein was derived from the pro-apoptotic human Fas ligand (FasL) protein. APO010 causes cell death of cancerous cells through a mechanism of targeting Fas receptors on the surface of cancer cells inducing cell apoptosis. A Phase I study is currently being conducted with APO010 on patients with untreatable, advanced or refractory solid tumors. APO866 APO866, a drug that inhibits the growth of human tumors, is a potent and specific inhibitor of a key enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of NAD, called NMPRT. The worldwide development and marketing rights to APO866 were acquired from Astellas in October 2005. APO866 is a drug that provides a new therapeutic approach to cancer. TopoTarget has opened three separate clinical studies of APO866 : # to assess APO866 as a treatment of advanced melanoma, # to assess APO866 as a treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTL) # to assess APO866 as a treatment of refractory or relapsed B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The CTL trial was terminated in 2016 at the interim review point due to lack of efficacy.APO866 Not Effective for Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma. March 2016 =Pre-clinical development= APO200 APO200 is a therapeutic recombinant protein that is developed from the ectodysplasin A-1 (EDA1) gene. This product is used to treat a rare human genetic disease linked with mutations in the EDA1 gene. The disease reduces a patient's ability to sweat and increases hypersensitivity to heat, aberrant dentition, hairlessness, and dry skin. Completed pre-clinical development has shown the potential of APO200 in animal models of X-Linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED). APO200 gained orphan drug status from the FDA in February 2006. TopoTarget plans to sell this project to another company or to out-license it. HSP90 inhibitors Heat shock proteins are vital to eukaryotic cell function and are among the most highly expressed proteins in all species. HSP90 facilitates protein folding, cell signaling, and tumor repression. Inhibition of HSP90 interferes with the PI3K/AKT pathway, initiating apoptosis, making HSP90 inhibitors attractive prospects for cancer treatment. A number of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) small molecule inhibitors have been developed by TopoTarget, with several compounds showing high potency in several cancer cell lines, particularly those cell lines which over-express HER2 receptors. This project is still in pre-clinical trials and TopoTarget is in the process of out-licensing the product or looking for companies to collaborate with on the project. Future perspectives =Research= TopoTarget has several drugs in preclinical development. A current target is Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is key in protein folding and maturation. TopoTarget is currently looking for small molecule drugs that inhibit HSP90 function to induce apoptosis. Current molecules have shown great promise and are undergoing optimization and evaluation in order to obtain a patent. TopoTarget is also studying the mechanism of action behind the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway to understand targets for anti-tumor drugs. Currently they are looking to find a lead compound in order to continue these studies. TopoTarget is also looking into more drugs that interrupt HDAC activity, not only for cancer therapy, but for diseases like malaria and CNS disorders.

DFT is based on a set of applied mathematical tools that are used to connect processes in a flow and link it to daily changes in demand. DFT represents a scientific approach to flow manufacturing for discrete production. It is built on principles of demand pull where customer demand is the central signal to guide factory and office activity in the daily operation. DFT is intended to provide an alternative to schedule-push manufacturing which primarily uses a sales plan and forecast to determine a production schedule. History It was created by John R. Costanza, an executive with operations management experience at Hewlett Packard and Johnson & Johnson.Fortune Magazine (2000). Heroes of U.S. Manufacturing, 20 March 2000. Costanza, who was later nominated as a Nobel Laureate in Economics for Working Capital Management, founded the John Costanza Institute of Technology in Englewood, CO in 1984 to provide consulting and education services for manufacturers to implement the methodology. DFT uses applied mathematical methods to link raw and in-process materials with units of time and production resources in order to create a continuous flow in the factory. The objective is to link factory processes together in a flow and drive it to customer demand instead of to an internal forecast that is inherently inaccurate. Early adopters of DFT included American Standard Companies\\"Transforming productivity in multinational manufacture using demand flow technology,\\" with E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning, Vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 82–95, December 1994.Fortune Magazine (1994). PROPHET OF ZERO WORKING CAPITAL. 13 June 1994Lawrence Bossidy; Ram Charan (2004) Confronting Reality. p203. General Electric Lawrence Bossidy; Ram Charan (2002) Execution. p65. and John Deere (Deere & Company). In the early years, DFT was regarded as a method for \\"just-in-time\\" (JIT), which advocated manufacturing processes driven to actual customer demand via Kanban. It was introduced as a way for American manufacturers to adopt Japanese production techniques, such as Toyota Production System (TPS), whilst avoiding some of the cultural conflicts in applying Japanese business methods in an American company. Later, it has come to be seen as a lean manufacturing method that allows factories to implement techniques such as one-piece flow, TAKT-based line design, Kanban material management and demand-driven production. Demand Flow Technology is promoted as a method for any product, any day, any volume. In 2001, Costanza was awarded a patent for this approach for mixed-model manufacturing.Costanza, John R., \\"The Quantum Leap In Speed To Market\\", John Costanza Institute of Technology, Inc. (1996). pp. 1–352US Patent 6198980 – System and method for designing a mixed-model manufacturing process, 6 March 2001 Principles =Demand-driven manufacturing= The central tenet to DFT is the primacy of customer demand in daily execution of the operation. According to Aberdeen Group, :\\"Demand driven manufacturing involves a synchronized, closed loop between customer orders, production scheduling, and manufacturing execution; all while simultaneously coordinating the flow of materials across the supply chain.\\" [Aberdeen Group, 2007].\\"How to achieve best in class demand-driven manufacturing\\", http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2008/01/how_to_achieve_best_in_class_demand_driven_manufacturing.html DFT is a pathway to achieve demand-driven manufacturing capability. It is used as a framework to guide the design, implementation and deployment of demand driven manufacturing in a repeatable form. In this way, it is similar original concept of Just-in-Time (JIT) that was first deployed in Japanese manufacturers using a foundation of total quality management.Mary Walton. (1986). “The Deming Management Method”, page 75, More recently, Just-in-time has been more commonly used to describe supplier delivery methods, rather than a production philosophy. DFT assumes basic process capability that can arise from TQM and statistical process control (SPC) principles and embeds it in a framework of management that can more easily achieve demand driven in a repeatable way. As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders. Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation. =Mixed-model production= Mixed- model production is the production of a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material. It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering.Chris Anderson. (2006). “The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More”. Products are increasingly assembled from standard components and sub-assemblies, using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour. DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines. A production schedule based on MRP will tend to cope with high product mix by allocating each model to a multiple of a shift or a day. This means that the whole product mix is supplied across a scheduling cycle of a multiple of weeks. This tends to extend the lead-time or increase dependency on the forecast. DFT offers “The ability to accommodate a range of volumes for any product, any day, based on the direction of actual customer demand”. =Product synchronization= The first tool to be used in a DFT implementation, product synchronization is a definition of relationship of processes in a flow to build a product. It takes the form of a diagram, usually created in pen and paper or whiteboard and formalized with a visualization program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio. It displays how the processes relate to each other in a flow, with the conversion of raw material to finished goods. A process is defined by \\"A logical grouping of value-adding work performed to a common volume\\". =Sequence of events (SoE)= Each of the processes in the product synchronization requires a standard process definition. In DFT, the sequence of events provides this definition. In The Quantum Leap, written by Costanza,John R. Costanza (2005). The Quantum Leap: Next Generation the sequence of events is defined as \\"[t]he definition of the required work and quality criteria to build a product in a specific production process.\\" The SoE usually takes the form of a table with the product code, process ID, task description and sequence, required work and set-up time for machines and labour, and quality check criteria. The SoE intends to define times that are reasonable, realistic and repeatable to perform to the necessary quality. Many of the strengths and criticisms of DFT as a methodology stem from the SoE. The SoEs are the foundation of process definition but are not used as work instructions. To communicate standard work at the work center, operation method sheets are used. In an MRP systems environment, the SoE represents a drill-down from the routing that provides a tabular view of the Product Synchronization at the process level. A DFT manufacturer would therefore use the SoE as the master record of process definition and derive routings and ISO documentation from it. =Operation method sheets= These are visual description of work in motion, materials and the required quality check. In the purest form, operation method sheets are drawn in wire-frame to show the significant contours of the product form and clearly represent work in motion and quality without visual noise. The OMS has three stages of activity: total quality check, work, and verify. This establishes the concept where each operator checks the output quality of the operation immediately upstream. This can contribute to a total quality culture and parts-per-million capability. =Mixed-model process map= The sequence of events and product synchronization define how tasks and quality check compose the process for any given product. The mixed-model process map shows how products and processes form a requirement for resources. In such a map, the products and processes form a matrix with products as rows and processes as columns. At the intersection are most commonly actual times (standard times at the process from the sequence of events), but could also display yield and optionality ratios. =Demand at capacity= Demand at capacity is the volume of production for a single product item at capacity. It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply. The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production. In contrast to Toyota Production System, and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand. Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply. The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand. A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range. This will likely affect the resource productivity and inventory levels. A greater mix on the line is able to provide a higher level of service for any given level of resources and inventory. =Effective hours= The effective hours is the time available for a given resource to produce product or perform process set-up or changeover. It is defined per shift and represents the total available time to perform tasks set in the SoE. Non-productive time such as equipment maintenance, breaks, 5S activity and continuous improvement is deducted from effective hours. Setup time is included as it is arguably a form of productive time and calculations for batch size optimization and dynamic Kanban will require setup and run-time to be managed from a common pool of resource time. =Takt & Operational Cycle-Time, OP c/t= Takt-time is the ratio of time to volume at capacity and in DFT is expressed as Where HE is Effective Hours, S is the number of shifts and DC is the demand at capacity, a daily rate set for design purposes at some point 2 to 5 years into the future. This ratio can be expressed for finished products at the end of the line and is referred to as Takt-Time. It can also apply at the process where bill of material relationships, process yield and optionality can affect the dependent volume for any given Dc at the finished goods level. At the process level, this ratio is known as operational cycle-time. Takt time is typically used to calculate the \\"line design\\" or number and disposition of physical resources required to produce a given mix and volume of products that changes on a daily basis according to customer demand. Uniquely to DFT Takt time is constant, based on a fixed mix and product volume which is set for factory design purposes 2 to 5 years into the future. This allows for a stable \\"line design\\" that does not need to change on a daily basis. Daily changes in mix and volume are accommodated in DFT by adjusting the number of people working in production. Those not required to meet the Daily Rate (Dr) are free to spend quality time in training and continuous improvement activities. Weekly scheduling cycles to achieve level-loading of mix and volume, which cause significant planning delays, are eliminated. It becomes possible to produce any product on any day in response to real customer demand making possible a true Demand Flow. As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders. Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation etc. =Material Kanban= DFT shares a conventional definition of material Kanban based on a visual signal to replenish a point of consumption with required material. A typical material Kanban system in DFT is \\"Single Card, Multiple Container\\" and enables card or container quantities to be consumed and replenished without shortages. Material Kanban provides an alternative to kitting as a way of issuing material to the production floor. A DFT environment will strive to simplify the definition of warehouse locations for material and reduce the number of transactions required to control the flow of material during production. The aim of Material Kanban is to connect the material flow with actual requirement at the process and provide a more robust availability of parts to production whilst reducing the response-time to the customer. =Production Kanban= Production Kanban is designed for a replenishment quantity that may be smaller than a lot size or batch. It is based on a \\"dual card Kanban\\" system where a \\"move\\" card or container represents the quantity required by the downstream point of consumption and a \\"produce\\" card is kept on a display board and accumulates to a replenishment batch. =Demand-based management= Demand-based management is an approach that defines tolerance capability for demand in order to unify material and production planning under conditions of demand uncertainty. It uses \\"flex fences\\" to set the upper and lower boundaries of supply against a definition of the current daily rate of demand. The current rate is usually some kind of smoothed average and will move over time. The flex-fences will be different for different product items or groups and should be calculated individually. Order policies, purchasing, inventory and production capacity will all be set against these flex fence boundaries, so these calculations will sit at the heart of operations planning. Unfortunately, this is a calculation-intensive and critical process that is largely unsupported by MRP/ERP systems. The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management has not had the same level of adoption experienced by the rest of the DFT principles. Value and results Companies that implement DFT are typically looking for an improvement in the response to customer demand. This is reflected in the lead-time or replenishment time for finished product and will affect the level of inventory that is held to buffer response requirements. Effective response to demand can be described as a distribution curve, with some orders taking longer to fill than others. The result is variation and uncertainty in the manufacturer’s ability to serve the market. Working capital is required to hedge this response lag and uncertainty. DFT aims to reduce both the variation and duration of response to demand. This can be seen as a more capable fulfillment that provides a higher level of customer service at a lower level of working capital. The intended results are improvement in delivery performance together with increased cash- flow and return on working capital. Applications Demand flow technology is applicable in a wide range of product environments and has been successfully deployed in many different industries. Companies who have embraced demand flow technology include John Deere,Demand Flow Technology, Not Just a Manufacturing Strategy, YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWfKpJTLK7U&feature;=youtube_gdata,Stanleyworks (1996). Form 10-K Flextronics, American Standard Companies, Trane, AstraZeneca and many others. It has a strength in those manufacturing operations that are expected to supply a high mix to an unpredictable and volatile market. It is often seen as the science behind flow manufacturing for discrete manufacturers, whose products do not naturally flow across the manufacturing processes. Advantages and criticisms =Advantages= It is simple Demand flow technology provides a simple, logical method based on applied mathematics. The technique is based on simple operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so it does not rely on advanced mathematics. It is repeatable DFT forms a step-by-step guide to converting production from a scheduled-push to a demand-pull and flow system. Although it is applicable to a wide range of products, the steps are consistent and work in the same way. It does not depend on the judgment of an expert in the same way as lean or Six Sigma and can be taught to a broader audience through short training workshops. It is effective At its heart, DFT formalizes the natural flow of material, processes and information required to build a product. It is not so much an invented technology as a description of the optimal way to align a factory towards customer demand. It is customer-centric DFT places the customer at the center of the operation. It enables companies to formalise a customer-centric view with practical tasks and actions that guide behaviour in the organisation. It moves the concept of customer-driven to an achievable plan of action beyond a statement of philosophy. It aligns business and customer goals The concept of maximizing shareholder value is often seen as a conflict with the quality of customer service.Jack Welch. (2009) Welch condemns share price focus, Financial Times, 12 March 2009 Demand Flow Technology, if applied correctly, can unify financial and customer objectives in a holistic approach to managing operating capital and growing a business. =Criticisms= It is constrained to the factory Demand flow techniques have been widely applied to the factory, yet have failed to gain widespread acceptance in corporate management. All too often, it tends to be limited to production planning whilst operations and material planning continue to be dominated by use of ERP/MRP systems. The holistic ideal of demand flow may be fractured by this conflict. It is unsupported by systems Major ERP/MRP vendors have largely ignored the advantages of Demand Flow techniques, or been acquired before their products have had a chance to gain market share. The advocates and users of Demand Flow have largely failed to challenge the inadequate logic that conventional MRP uses for planning capacity and production resources Mabert, Vincent A. (2006) The early road to material requirements planning, The Journal of Operations Management.Pochet, Yves. Wolsey, Laurence A. (2000). Production planning by mixed integer programming. As a result, manufacturers are forced to rely on an outdated routine for planning that is largely unchanged since the 1960s. It requires process definition and discipline DFT aims to apply a standard process definition of product to daily requirements of demand. This favours processes that are capable and defined to the task level. This is sometimes a level of detail and discipline absent from the organisation. The creation and maintenance of Sequence of Events documentation involves extensive manual work. There are powerful advantages to quality and capability in performing this work, but success usually depends on management commitment to change beyond the narrow actions of a DFT implementation.

It won the award for 'Best Soap Opera' at the RAPA Awards in 2001. Overview Kajal is a young woman who gets married on the insistence of her mother. She has not met the man prior to the wedding. However, on the wedding night, Kajal discovers that the man is actually a mentally challenged person who has the mind of an eight year old. She realises that she has been tricked into marrying him by her in-laws. This makes her furious. Kajal wants to tell her mother, but she cannot because her mother is a heart patient. Kajal is unwilling to accept this marriage and blames her in-laws for ruining her life. Neeraj is innocent and childlike. Kajal finds it hard to tolerate his behaviour, because of which their relationship has quite a turbulent start. After spending some time together, however, Kajal and Neeraj become close. Kajal's mother finds out about the situation and forces Kajal to come back home. Neeraj panics since he can't stay without Kajal, who also doesn't want to leave him. Kajal's mother files a case against Neeraj's family. But, Kajal refuses to leave Neeraj. This strengthens their bond. Kajal comes back and starts her mission to cure Neeraj. She consults a specialist doctor who assists her in treating Neeraj. Gradually, Kajal becomes suspicious that someone in the family doesn't want Neeraj to get cured, but she isn't sure who the person is since everyone seems to love Neeraj a lot. Neeraj's doctor advises Kajal to take Neeraj to a medical camp which could help cure him. Kajal and Neeraj go, although Neeraj's father opposes the idea. When they come back, everyone is surprised at how much Neeraj has improved. All is going well, until on Neeraj's birthday, someone attacks him and he gets hurt on his head. This causes him to regress back into his earlier condition. Kajal is shattered, yet, she refuses to give up hope. She takes Neeraj to the United States for treatment. When they return, Neeraj is fully recovered. He is able to attend office, make his own decisions and understand everything. Kajal and Neeraj are able to live their marital life properly, and express their love to each other. Kajal becomes pregnant, because of which everyone is overjoyed. However, some misunderstandings occur between Kajal and Neeraj, which leads to them having an argument. Kajal has an accident and loses her child. She also loses her memory partially. Soon, it is revealed that Kajal was only pretending to have lost her memory to protect herself from the person who was responsible for Neeraj's condition. That person is Neeraj's mother, who is actually his stepmother. She was the person who killed Neeraj's grandfather, and made him mentally unstable. The reason behind all of this was the fact that Neeraj is the heir to all of his grandfather's property, which his stepmother wanted for herself and her real children. Neeraj's stepmother dies as a result of poisoning, and so does his father. A few years later, Kajal and Neeraj are shown talking to each other about their lives. Neeraj thanks Kajal for supporting him and never giving up on him. They also have a daughter, who they named Asha. The show concludes on a happy note that everything is fine now, all because of Kajal's efforts (koshish).

Early life Treben was born in 1907 in Žatec, Bohemia, then Austria-Hungary, the middle of three daughters of the owner of a printing shop who died when she was 10. After the Great War, the Sudetenland became part of the newly founded Czechoslovakia. In 1945, at the end of the Second World War, she and her husband Ernst Gottfried Treben were victims of the Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. For several years they lived in refugee camps until they found refuge in Austria and settled down in Grieskirchen in 1951. She died in 1991. Career Treben became famous through her two books: Health Through God's PharmacyHealth Through God's Pharmacy: and Maria Treben's Cures.Maria Treben's Cures: The first was translated into 24 languages and sold over 8 million copies. Treben addressed seminars and presented at natural health conferences in Germany, Austria and across Europe, attracting hundreds of people. She is perceived as a pioneer of the renewed interest for natural remedies and traditional medicine at the end of the 20th century. Remedies Treben used traditional German and Eastern European remedies handed down from previous generations. She only used local herbs and always accompanied her remedies with advice on diet. She commonly used Thyme, Greater Celandine, Ramsons, Speedwell, Calamus, Camomile, Nettle and Lady's Mantle. She treated a broad range of conditions from psoriasis to constipation and diabetes to insomnia. She used her own recipes as well as traditional healing remedies like Swedish bitters that she used as a cure-all. Some of her remedies and advice proved to be controversial, such as some of the more esoteric ingredients used in the greater swedish bitters recipe [which?].

Gateway Cloning Technique allows transfer of DNA fragments between different cloning vectors while maintaining the reading frame. Using Gateway, one can clone subclone DNA segments for functional analysis. The system requires the initial insertion of a DNA fragment into a plasmid with two flanking recombination sequences called “att L 1” and “att L 2”, to develop a “Gateway Entry clone” (special Invitrogen nomenclature). Large archives of Gateway Entry clones, containing the vast majority of human, mouse and rat ORFs (open reading frames) have been cloned from human cDNA libraries or chemically synthesized to support the research community using NIH (National Institutes of Health) funding (e.g., Mammalian Gene Collection, http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/). The availability of these gene cassettes in a standard Gateway cloning plasmid helps researchers quickly transfer these cassettes into plasmids that facilitate the analysis of gene function. Gateway cloning does take more time for initial set-up, and is more expensive than traditional restriction enzyme and ligase-based cloning methods, but it saves time, and offers simpler and highly efficient cloning for down-stream applications. The technology has been widely adopted by the life science research community especially for applications that require the transfer of thousands of DNA fragments into one type of plasmid (e.g., one containing a CMV promoter for protein expression in mammalian cells), or for the transfer of one DNA fragment into many different types of plasmids (e.g., for bacterial, insect and mammalian protein expression).  Basic Steps  The first step in Gateway cloning is the preparation of a Gateway Entry clone. Entry clones are often made in two steps: 1) “Gateway attB1, and attB2” sequences are added to the 5’, and 3’ end of a gene fragment, respectively, using gene specific PCR primers and PCR-amplification; 2) the PCR amplification products are then mixed with special plasmids called Gateway “Donor vectors” (Invitrogen nomenclature) and the proprietary “BP Clonase” enzyme mix. The enzyme mix catalyzes the recombination and insertion of the att-B-sequence-containing PCR product into the att P recombination sites in the Gateway Donor vector. Once the cassette is part of the target plasmid, it is called an \\"Entry clone\\" in the Gateway nomenclature, and recombination sequences are referred to as the Gateway “att L” type. The gene cassette in the Gateway Entry clone can then be simply and efficiently transferred into any Gateway Destination vector (Invitrogen nomenclature for any Gateway plasmid that contains Gateway “att R” recombination sequences and elements such as promoters and epitope tags, but not ORFs) using the proprietary enzyme mix, “LR Clonase”. Thousands of Gateway Destination plasmids have been made and are freely shared amongst researchers across the world. Gateway Destination vectors are similar to classical expression vectors containing multiple cloning sites, before the insertion of a gene of interest, using restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Gateway Destination vectors are commercially available from Invitrogen, EMD (Novagen) and Covalys. Since Gateway cloning uses patented recombination sequences, and proprietary enzyme mixes available only from Invitrogen, the technology does not allow researchers to switch vendors and contributes to the lock-in effect of all such patented procedures. To summarize the different steps involved in Gateway cloning: * Gateway BP reaction: PCR-product with flanking att B sites (this step can also use other methods of DNA isolation, such as restriction- digestion) + Donor vector containing att P sites + BP clonase => Gateway Entry clone, containing att L sites, flanking gene of interest * Gateway LR reaction: Entry clone containing att L sites + Destination vector containing att R sites, and promoters and tags + LR clonase => Expression clone containing att B sites, flanking gene of interest, ready for gene expression.

The marketed compound is besifloxacin hydrochloride. It was developed by SSP Co. Ltd., Japan, and designated SS734. SSP licensed U.S. and European rights to SS734 for ophthalmic use to InSite Vision Incorporated () in 2000. InSite Vision developed an eye drop formulation (ISV-403) and conducted preliminary clinical trials before selling the product and all rights to Bausch & Lomb in 2003. The eye drop was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 29, 2009, and marketed under the trade name Besivance.  Pharmacodynamics  Besifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that has a broad spectrum in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative ocular pathogens: e.g., Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Moraxella lacunata, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus salivarius. Besifloxacin has been found to inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. The mechanism of action of besifloxacin involves inhibition of two enzymes which are essential for the synthesis and replication of bacterial DNA: the bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  Medical use  Besifloxacin is indicated in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by sensitive germs, as well as in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing laser therapy for the treatment of cataracts.  Adverse effects  During the treatment, the most frequently reported ocular adverse reaction was the appearance of conjunctival redness (approximately 2% of patients).

Unlike the original, work on the building took only five years. Ahsan Ullah Moni, a wealthy Bangladeshi film-maker, announced his 'Copycat version of Taj Mahal' project in December 2008. The project cost about US$56 Million, and was built 20 miles northeast of Capital Dhaka. Moni has explained that he built a replica of the Taj Mahal so that the poor of his nation can realise their dream of seeing neighbouring India's famed monument. This caused complaints from Indian officials, \\"You can't just go and copy historical monuments\\" an official of Indian High Commission in Dhaka told press. Construction began in 2003, but Mr Moni says that he came up with the idea in 1980 when he first visited the real Taj in Agra, India. He said that his homage had been built because most people living in Bangladesh - where nearly half of the population exist below the poverty line - cannot afford to travel to India to see the real thing. \\"Everyone dreams about seeing the Taj Mahal but very few Bangladeshis can make the trip because it's too expensive for them,\\" he said. Mr Moni first visited the original in 1980 and has made six return trips. So enamoured was he of the site that he hired a group of architects and sent them to India to measure it. He said: “I used the same marble and stone as in the original Taj. We used machinery, which is why it took less time. Otherwise it would have taken 20 years and 22,000 workers to complete it.” Mr Mittal, of the Indian High Commission, did concede that the replica was unlikely to detract from the magnificence of the original. He also admitted that visitors were unlikely to mix up one with the other. “A copy is a form of flattery, I suppose,” he said. Taj Mahal in Bangladesh The construction of the replica had irritated the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. Early reports said the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh says it will sue Ahsanullah Moni () for copyright infringement of the original 350-year-old building; however, the Indian High Commission later announced that the replica was unlikely to detract visitors from the original.India Angry Over Fake Taj Mahal Sky News, 12:49 pm UK, Friday 12 December 2008 The building was picked up by many news channels, newspapers and sites, including the BBC, Sky, Reuters, Voice of America, Hindustan Times, Guardian and The Times, and caused large discussion and debate on social networking sites and blogs.

A Grade monoplane carried Germany's first air mail, when pilot Pentz made a flight from Bork to Bruck in February 1912 with a small sack of mail in his lap. Although successful, Grade monoplanes did not become as famous as many contemporary European designs, and for this reason comparatively few were built. In 1921 he established an automobile company called \\"Grade Automobilwerke AG\\", which produced small, 2 seater personal cars. The small aircraft company, founded with this money, did not survived the Treaty of Versailles of 1919.

His early career was with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and in the Sudanese Irrigation Department before he began a 26-year spell with the Admiralty Civil Engineers Department. Harris rose to become Civil Engineer in Chief in 1959 and was responsible for building facilities to cope with the change in focus of the Royal Navy from gunnery ships to aircraft carriers and submarines, including the nuclear submarine docks at Faslane. Harris was later made director-general of highways in the Ministry of Transport during which time he was responsible for the construction of the 650 miles of motorway, a focus on ground investigation at pre-tender stage and the development of new motorway signalling and telecommunications systems. He later entered private practice as a consulting engineer and was chairman of the Port of Dover. Harris also served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers and of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.  Early career  The docks at Faslane Harris was born in Liverpool on 10 June 1912 to Captain James Whyte Harris and Margaret Roberts Buchanan Harris (née Forsyth). His father was a captain in the Royal Naval Reserve. Harris was educated at Liverpool College before studying the Mechanical Sciences Tripos at Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge. Harris worked for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as an engineer from 1932 until 1935 when he transferred to the Irrigation Department of Sudan. He returned from Sudan in 1937 to work in the Civil Engineer's Department of the Admiralty, the start of a 26-year association with that department. Harris married Margaret Harvie in 1938, they would have three sons and one daughter together and would be grandparents to sixteen. Harris received several promotions during his time with the Admiralty, becoming Assistant Civil Engineer in Chief in 1950, Deputy Civil Engineer in Chief in 1955 and Civil Engineer in Chief in 1959. Harris gained a Commonwealth Fund of New York Scholarship in 1950 which allowed him to spend two years with the US Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks. In 1960 he became the Director-General of Navy Works at the Admiralty, a post he would hold until the reorganisation which followed the merger of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army administrations into the Ministry of Defence in 1963. During his time with the Admiralty Harris saw the last large gunnery ships go out of service to be replaced with submarines and aircraft carriers. This change of fleet composition required a revolution in dockyard facilities, for which he was responsible, especially those at Faslane, the submarine base.  Director-general of works and highways In the 1963 Queen's Birthday Honours Harris was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and also became Director-General of Works at the Ministry of Public Building and Works. From 1965 Harris was the Director-General of Highways at the Ministry of Transport (later the Department of the Environment). During this time he was responsible for all design, construction and maintenance of roads in England. He was responsible for securing agreement from the county councils and the Association of Consulting Engineers on road schemes and for presenting these to the secretary of state, Barbara Castle. In 1967-68 he split England into six regions, each the responsibility of a roads construction unit to manage the delivery of regional infrastructure. Harris was chair of a committee into contracting by the ministry and recommended that competitive tendering be maintained but that more ground investigation was required into the subsoil prior to tender and that this information should be shared with the contractor. He also implemented the use of standard methods of compaction in place of the more time-consuming method of validation testing after the works were completed. Harris implemented a new signalling system for motorways and implemented a new telecommunications system, for which he allocated £27 million of funding. Harris's tenure as Director-General saw the construction of 650 miles of motorways and an expenditure of £2.2 billion on new road construction. Harris was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1969 Birthday Honours. Harris was the chief British delegate to the Permanent Association of Navigation Congresses (PIANC) from 1969 until 1985 and from 1970 to 1971 was the country's chief delegate to the Permanent Association of Roads Congresses. Harris was a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) from 1971 to 1974 and president from November 1974 to November 1975.. He also updated the ICE's contract documentations (including the 5th edition of ICE Conditions of Contract published in June 1973) and its standard method of measurement.  Later career  In 1973 Harris left the Department of the Environment and became a partner at Peter Fraenkel & Partners, a position he held for the next five years. From 1976 to 1979 Harris was chairman of the Construction Industry Manpower Board and from 1978 to 1987 was the chairman of the B&CE; Holiday Management Company and Benefit Trust Company, a provider of benefits, holiday pay and pensions to the construction industry. Harris was the deputy chairman of the board of the Port of Dover for 1980 to 1982, having been a member of the board since 1959. In 1977 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, then named the Fellowship of Engineering. In 1984 he was elected president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. In 1985 he received the Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award from the US Army Corps of Engineers in recognition of his work to secure an international agreement upon the disposal of dredged material. His wife, Margaret, died in 1991 and in 1992 he married Rachel Bishop. Harris died at East Carlton, Northamptonshire on 20 February 2005.

He was chief of staff of the 10th Parachute Division until the Algiers putsch, when he followed orders from General Challe, one of the leaders of the Putsch. He was arrested and sent to Paris, where he was immediately released. He was posted to Mauritania for two years before leaving the French Army in 1964.

Biography  Bridge in Seville At first, he studied music but ultimately dedicated himself to his love of painting. He received his earliest art education from José de la Vega Marrugal in Seville.Brief biography @ the Carmen Thyssen Museum. Later, he attended the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Sevilla, where he studied with , Manuel Ussel de Guimbarda and Emilio Sánchez Perrier.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. Throughout his life, he participated in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, where he was awarded medals in 1887, 1890 and 1895. He also participated in the Exposition Universelle (1889) and the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1899, he was named a member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. In 1904, he visited Tangier and produced some paintings in Orientalist style. His works are in numerous museums (including the Carmen Thyssen Museum) and private collections. He was also a regular contributor of illustrations for the magazine Blanco y Negro. He took much of his inspiration from the city of Seville and the Guadalquivir, including the Guadaira rivers and surrounding areas. He was closely associated with the Alcalá de Guadaira school of painting. In his final years, he focussed on the gardens, patios and parks of Seville, at which time he developed more of a modernist and impressionist aesthetic.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'école Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p. 276 Work Garcia's work remains well-known because many of his landscapes were reproduced as black and white illustrations, postcards and posters.

West to Virginia > Woolf, in The Letters of Vita Sackville, London: Hutchinson, 1984.  Plot introduction  The story is mainly set at Chevron, an enormous country house and estate in the south of England, which is the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Chevron. In some passages the setting switches to London, for example when Sebastian visits Teresa. The plot covers the years of Sebastian's and Viola's adolescence which means approximately 1905–1910.  Plot summary  Overview of characters grouped according to location and class Sebastian, is the 19-year-old Duke of Chevron and owner of the country estate of Chevron. As he had not yet attained his majority, the estate is presided over by his mother, Lucy, Dowager Duchess of Chevron. Being at home from Oxford at the weekends he regularly attends the magnificent parties given by his widowed mother, where the guests indulge in food, drinks, games and affairs. At one of these parties he meets the adventurer Leonard Anquetil, who grew up under humble circumstances but managed to become well-known and socially acknowledged due to his several successful expeditions. During a deep conversation on top of Chevron’s roof Anquetil tries to open Sebastian’s eyes to the artificiality and hypocrisy of his mother’s aristocratic society and to convince the young heir to leave his social obligations behind in order to accompany Anquetil on an expedition. However, Sebastian is not impressed enough by the predictions made by Anquetil (affairs, marriage, service to the crown, but never being completely content) to turn his back on his safe home. One of the reasons for that is the love affair he had just started with Sylvia Roehampton, a married friend of his mother. After Sylvia’s husband finds out about this relationship she, Lady Roehampton, leaves Sebastian and does not accept his offer to run away and start a new life together, since she does not want a public scandal and sticks to social conventions. Soon after, Sebastian plans to start an affair with Teresa Spedding, a doctor’s wife, but she eventually does not respond to Sebastian’s courtship. Yet coming from a middle-class background she is extremely impressed by and interested in aristocratic society. Sebastian, being disappointed and never seeming to be content, attempts to distract himself by having two more affairs with women from different classes. During the coronation ceremony of George V, which he attends, he finally gives in to the expectations and obligations his family history imposes on him and plans to marry a decent young lady and to settle down in a career at the Court. Just a few moments later, he meets Leonard Anquetil again, who informs him that he is going to marry Sebastian’s independent sister Viola, to whom the adventurer regularly wrote letters in the last years, and repeats his offer to join him on an expedition. Stunned by this possibility Sebastian agrees to accompany him.  Main characters  * Sebastian / Duke of Chevron: age 19, attractive, heir of Chevron * Viola: Sebastian's younger sister, independent, critical, breaks through expected conventions * Lucy / Dowager Duchess of Chevron: Sebastian's and Viola's mother, widow, follows the conventions of the aristocratic society * Sylvia, Lady Roehampton: notable aristocratic woman, Sebastian's first love affair, friend of the Duchess of Chevron * Leonard Anquetil: self-made man, independent, no obligations to society * Teresa Spedding: middle-class woman, wife of a doctor, overcomes the temptation to have a liaison with Sebastian, impressed by Chevron and the aristocratic society  Major themes  * Vita Sackville-West gives insight into the every day life of the upper class of the Edwardian era. She describes the occasions where the high society meets regularly such as the glamorous parties, which are given every weekend by Sebastian’s mother Lucy, and the numerous luncheons which take place during the week. The customs and free time activities like playing cards are also mentioned. With this presentation, however, Sackville-West reveals the majority of the aristocracy and upper class as superficial and artificially constructed. A lot of members of this social group are not authentically interested in anything other than their personal entertainment. Intellectual issues are discussed only superficially and cultural institutions are only visited for representational reasons. An awareness that the keeping of the expensive lifestyle is only possible with the help of servants, is absent in the minds of most aristocrats Sackville-West depicts. * Chevron, the estate of Sebastian’s family, forms a world of its own, since it seems to be an independent community with its own shops and a loyal staff which mostly consists of families. The peaceful atmosphere and the rituals, such as the Christmas tree ceremony, and the consistent rules are of high value for Sebastian, the squire. However, Chevron is about to undergo changes too. The son of a loyal employee for instance, does not want to follow his family tradition and work at Chevron, but turns his back on it and plans to start working in the motor industries. Leonard Anquetil compares Chevron to a “splendid tomb” and states, that “the house is dying from the top”, which indicates change. * Most of the married couples in The Edwardians did not marry for romantic reasons but represent convenience marriages, which are to maintain social standards. To compensate the desire for affection, extramarital affairs according to the concept of polyamory are common practice. However, these affairs are to be kept secret, and scandals such as divorces have to be avoided by all means. That is why Sylvia Roehampton does not leave her husband in order to start a new life with Sebastian, but abides with her husband so that a scandal and social downfall can be prevented. Sackville-West also describes the different social expectations to the different genders concerning their sexuality. Relationships out of wedlock are accepted with males (Sebastian), whereas upper class women would be disowned. * The question whether individuals are allowed to follow their personal decisions and to be self-determined or whether they have to stick to social conventions and family traditions, is also posed by Sackville-West. Leonard Anquetil and Viola, representatives of the former, decide to lead an independent life, make their own decisions and emancipate (Viola) themselves from aristocratic conventions. Sylvia Roehampton, representative of the latter, on the other side, decides to subordinate her personal desires, such as her love for Sebastian, to tradition and the expectations of the upper class. Sebastian is torn between those two positions.  Biographical influences  > “Vita had done what she set out to do: write a popular success; and she had > done it by recreating the lavish, feudal, immoral ancient régime of her > childhood. ... Chevron ... is Knole in every detail ... . She promotes the > lady of the house to the rank of Duchess, and divides her own personality > between the two children of the house – Sebastian, the young heir, dark > moody and glamorous, and Viola his withdrawn, straight-haired, sceptical > sister. ‘No character in this book is wholly fictitious,’ she wrote > provocatively in her Author’s Note.”Glendinning, Victoria. Vita: The Life of > V. Sackville-West, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1984. p. 231. Her writing of The Edwardians was greatly affected by Virginia Woolf, Vita’s female lover who introduced her to the Bloomsbury culture. Through her own novel Orlando, the protagonist of which is wholly based on Vita, she inspired her to write a novel about Knole House and her childhood experiences there herself. Her parents, Lionel Edward Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville and Victoria Sackville-West, had great influence on the development of Vita’s personality. As their only child she had to replace the male heir for her father who introduced her to the duties of a squire and whose love for Knole House, representing to her permanence and security, she adopted. However she could never inherit it because of her female gender. Therefore in The Edwardians Knole revives in Chevron as well in its physical features as also in the customs cultivated there. The relationship towards her mother was torn between hatred and love, the last overweighing. Vita was not to dwarf her own beauty or question her value system. Therefore Vita tended to suppress her feminine side and adopt traits of masculine courting behaviour. Lady Sackville-West was a major model for the aristocratic ladies in The Edwardians, where Vita also dealt with the mother-daughter relationship of the Edwardian age. Vita’s personality was embossed by dualities. Those can be seen in her relationships, her conception of gender, and herself being torn between conformity to traditions and genetic inheritance and her wish for self- determination. This is mirrored in the characters of Sebastian and Viola in The Edwardians.  Critical reception  In general, the book received positive reviews and sold well: 30,000 copies were sold in the first six months in England, and 80,000 copies in the first year in the United States. = Review highlights = See references.The Edwardians, Fortnightly Review, 128 (1930:July) p. 141; A.

Most of the massif crops out in Belgium, but a small part lies across the border with Germany. The massif consists of early Paleozoic (late Cambrian and Ordovician in age) metamorphic rocks, mostly quartzites and phyllites. In other parts of the Ardennes they form a basement which is covered by only slightly metamorphosed late Paleozoic limestones and sandstones, that only saw a low degree of metamorphism. On the other hand, the early Paleozoic rocks were deformed and metamorphosed to a higher degree during the Caledonian orogeny (about 450 million years ago). Both the Caledonian basement and the low grade cover rocks were deformed again during the Hercynian orogeny (about 350-280 million years ago). This phase of deformation created a large northeast-southwest oriented anticline that runs across the Belgian part of the Rhenish Massif (the Ardennes anticline). In the core of this anticline a number of massifs of early Paleozoic rocks crop out. The Stavelot Massif is one the larger, other Caledonian massifs are the Rocroi Massif, the Serpont Massif and the Givonne Massif. The higher competence of the Caledonian basement rocks made them more resistant to erosion. The massif therefore forms a plateau in the topography.

The species is known only from a mountain located between the provinces of Laguna and Quezon, Luzon where it was first discovered. Its plant host is Tetrastigma pisicarpum. This species went unnoticed since its first description by Blanco but was rediscovered in 2003 by members of the Tanggol Kalikasan, a local environment conservation group in Quezon province who first saw and photographed the open flower of this species. It was brought to the attention of Manuel S. Enverga University (MSEUF), who formed a team composed of students and faculty to document the newly discovered Rafflesia species. Morphology The mature flower bud of R. philippensis has a diameter of around 13-16 centimeters. Its fully opened flower has a diameter of 29.3-32 centimeters, placing it in a group composed of other small-sized Rafflesia species such as R. manillana, R. lobata, and R. baletei, whose open flowers measure an average of 20 centimeters in diameter. The open flower has 9-10 reddish perigone lobes measuring 9.0-10.5 centimeters with 8-12 white oval or elongated warts fused together along the median part of the lobe. R. philippensis has a distinctive closed diaphragm, same reddish color with the perigone lobes, 3.5-4.0 centimeters thick and measuring 12.5-13.0 centimeters across. The diaphragm’s opening has a diameter of 5.5-6.0 centimeters with an inner white margin lining. The diaphragm’s surface, like the perigone, is blotted with a network of white, thin, elongated and continuous warts. Distribution The species is known to occur as a small single population within the vicinity of Mount Banahaw National Park (14°03.239 N, 121°29.214 E), a protected area located south of the Laguna-Quezon provincial boundary line, between Laguna de Bay to the north and Tayabas Bay to the south. The mountain rises to about 2,100 meters above sea level. The park has been closed to the public since 2003 to allow the forest to recover from the adverse effects of human activities in the area. The population of R. philippensis is located along a trail in Kinabuhayan, Dolores, Quezon province. Taxonomy The taxonomy and nomenclature of this species is complex. The most recent work by Dr. Julie Barcelona and colleagues has documented that the taxon named by Blanco in the mid-19th century is indeed the same as the taxon named by her own research group and that of Dr. Domingo Madulid. Thus, the two later names, R. banahawensis and R. banahaw are synonyms of R. philippensis.

Industrial brooms became an emerging conservation product in the 20th century as the world moved toward more environmentally-friendly practices. They remove harmful substances and pollutants from the roads that would otherwise drain off into vegetation and/or water sources, or be continually carried and pushed around by vehicles and other street traffic. They add longevity to asphalt through cleansing and preventing early decay. This in turn cuts down on the environmentally harmful practices of consistently paving and the manufacturing of toxic asphalt. They prevent flooding by collecting debris that would accumulate and block storm drains.\\"Street Sweeping\\", Streets Division. City of San Diego.

It served the villages of Greetland, West Vale, Holywell Green and Stainland. History Viaduct of the line across Stainland Road Route The branch was a double track arrangement which curved southwards immediately after leaving Greetland station, passing through the outskirts of North Dean Woods. A siding was located here, serving a small coal yard, complete with coal drops. Climbing a gradient of 1 in 50, the line continued through a cutting before bridging Rochdale Road. In 1907, a halt was opened at this location, which served until the termination of passenger services in 1929. The line then continued through another cutting, before reaching West Vale viaduct. Almost immediately after the viaduct was a level crossing at the entrance to West Vale Station and goods yard. After West vale station, the line continued onwards, still climbing at 1 in 50, passing under a small bridge carrying Long Heys Road, until it reached Rawroyds viaduct, where the gradient eased to 1 in 344. After leaving the viaduct, the line curved left, passing through a cutting excavated from solid rock, on the approach to Stainland station and goods yard. which was located immediately after the bridge carrying Station Road. The line then continued for a few hundred yards until it reached Brookroyd mills =Traffic= This branch was built to serve the local textile works with coal and woollen yarn going up the valley to the mills in Holywell Green and Stainland, with stone and cloth coming down to Greetland. Six passenger trains a day were provided between Stainland and Halifax when it opened in 1875 and these were converted to railmotor operation in 1907. For the first three decades, passenger traffic fluctuated according to local demand, with 6 trains operating each way between Stainland and Greetland, with passengers changing at the latter. By 1905, 13 trains ran each weekday, plus a through train in each direction between Stainland and Bradford. The 1st of March 1907 saw the introduction of Hughes steam railmotors between Stainland and Halifax, via Greetland and Dryclough jct. These railmotors acquired the nickname of “The Stainland Donkey”, and continued to work the line until the cessation of passenger services on 23 September 1929. Occasionally, the railmotors were supplemented by radial tank engines and compartment coaches, which usually ran on the Saturday evening 21:35 service from Halifax. The radial tank and it’s three coaches would depart Halifax at roughly 21:30, for West Vale and Stainland only; with the rail motor following in close succession at 21:35, calling at Greetland, Rochdale Road halt, West Vale, and Stainland. Railmotors would carry around 60 passengers, however, on the 12:44 service for Halifax each Saturday, a trailer would be attached, increasing the seating capacity to 130. Special Services From 1885, an annual music festival was held in Stainland, which drew in large numbers of visitors from neighbouring villages. To accommodate for these increased numbers, two or three special services ran from Halifax to Stainland, each hauled by a radial tank. In the 1920s, a through train ran from Stainland to Blackpool and back, each Saturday of the holiday season. Goods traffic Goods traffic was worked by a pilot engine from Greetland, to Brookroyd mills, located a few hundred yards along from Stainland Station. In the early days of the branch, the freight was worked by 0-6-0 STs, the maximum load from Greetland to West vale being 17 wagons and a brake. Freight trains were usually made up of coal wagons, vans, and sheeted open wagons. The vans were used for textile and paper traffic. Coal was carried in open wagons, with side and bottom doors for the drops at Greetland. The first train of the day left Greetland sidings at 08:00, with a full load returning by during the afternoon. The second train left Greetland between 11:00 and 12:00, and cleared out all of the empty coal wagons. The third train left Greetland at approximately 15:30, returning at 17:00, clearing out all merchandise loaded during the day. This train ran much earlier on Saturdays, as the goods yard closed at 13:00. Goods Yards The line featured two goods yards, located at West Vale Station, and Stainland Station. Typically, the yards would be operational until 18:00 each weekday, with workers waiting until 17:30 latest to receive loads. On Saturdays, the yards would shut at an earlier time of 13:00. =West Vale goods yard= The goods yard was located Immediately after West Vale station, and featured 5 long sidings, one of which passed through a goods shed to a loading platform. One head shunt was provided for working the goods yard, and another was located at the south end. =Stainland goods yard= The goods yard was located opposite Stainland station, and consisted of five sidings and a loop which connected with the down line. There was a goods shed, similar to that at West Vale, and also a long loading platform by the siding furtherst from the main line. At the south end of this platform was a wagon weighbridge and office, as well as a small complex of cattle pens. A small stable to accomodtate 4 horses and a harness room was situated near to the road enterance to the yard. Stations Despite its short length of approximately 1.6 miles, the branch had 3 stations, Greetland, West Vale, and Stainland & Holywell Green , as well as Roachdale road halt, which operated from 1907 until 1929. All station buildings were demolished in 1937. =Closure= At the grouping, the service had increased to 16 each way but competition from trams led to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) withdrawing the service in September 1929. Goods services continued to run until September 1959, when the line was permanently closed. At some point between the termination of passenger services in 1929, and the 1950s; the line was converted to single track. In 1962, rails and sleepers were removed from the trackbed. Stretches of the line have been overbuilt since. The viaducts in West Vale and Holywell Green still stand. On West vale viaduct, a roadway has been paved for inclusion in a regional hiking path.

Wellman was himself a veteran of the U.S. Air Service as a World War I fighter pilot. Plot Soon after the US enters World War II, Steve Britt (Preston Foster), a former World War I flying ace, arrives at Thunderbird Field, looking for a job as a civilian primary flight instructor. The base commander is an old friend, Lt. Col. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald (Jack Holt), working with Squadron Leader Barrett (Reginald Denny, himself a World War I aerial observer), who is in charge of the Royal Air Force cadets at the base. Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders (Gene Tierney), lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders (George Barbier), also a close friend of Steve's. Steve immediately flies to their ranch and performs stunts over a water tank where Kay is bathing, blowing her robe away and then dropping her his flying coveralls. When he lands, she seems miffed, but responds to his passionate kiss of greeting. Kay is still very fond of him, but no longer deeply in love. Steve is introduced to the new class of RAF cadets, including Peter Stackhouse (John Sutton), whose father Steve knew. Mac warns Steve to \\"wash them out fast\\" if cadets cannot meet the requirements. Peter flies clumsily and is sick from acrophobia. After three such failures, Steve tries to persuade Peter to transfer, but Peter is confident he can overcome what he calls his \\"conditional reflex\\", and asks for more time. Peter reveals the reason why he wants to fly. His brother was killed on a bombing mission and their grandmother, Lady Jane Stackhouse (Dame May Whitty), summoned Peter, then an intern at a London hospital, home to show him the cheque she is sending Winston Churchill for the purchase of a new bomber to carry on the fight in Tom's memory. Since no male is left in the family to do so, Peter leaves his hospital service to enlist in the RAF to learn to fly. After hearing his story, Steve agrees to keep Peter in training. On his first leave, Peter meets Kay Saunders and is immediately infatuated. She dates Peter, but warns him that she might still be in love with Steve. Still, her instincts warn her that Steve would make a poor husband, as he is a carefree nomad not interested in settling down. Peter admires Steve and is grateful to him, so he warns Steve that he is in love with Kay and intends to propose marriage. Steve promises that he will not wash Peter out because of their rivalry. His judgment tells him that Peter will one day be a fine pilot. When Squadron Leader Barrett gives Peter a check flight, he gets sick again. Steve stands by Peter in a showdown, threatening to resign. Gramps throws a Fourth of July party for the cadets and, to help Steve win Kay, tricks Peter into riding a bucking bronco. This backfires when Peter proves to be an adept horseman. Steve sees that Kay has fallen in love with Peter, even before she realizes it herself. The decision on Peter's training must be made. Steve tells Peter to fly the aircraft just as he rode the bronco, by easing up and relaxing. The advice works. Steve then forces Peter to fly solo by bailing out, although he descends into a sandstorm and is blown along the ground toward a cliff. Peter lands nearby and saves Steve, but the wind flips his aircraft over. Mac believes that Peter's incompetence caused the damage, washes him out, and fires Steve. Kay convinces Mac and Barrett to giving them one more chance. She tells Steve that she has decided to marry Peter, and reminds him of his own words about where the war will be won. Peter makes good on the faith shown in him, making a deadstick landing when his engine fails during his solo flight. Soon after, Steve, hobbling on a cane, greets an incoming class of new RAF cadets.

It is widespread across western Canada and much of the western United States. A specimen was collected by explorer and botanist Meriwether Lewis near Lewis and Clark Pass in 1806.Schiemann, Donald Anthony, Wildflowers of Montana, page 238, Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula, 2005. Distribution The plant's native range extends from British Columbia and Alberta in the north, southward as far as northern Arizona and the Mojave Desert of California, and as far east as the Black Hills of South Dakota. It grows in many types of habitat from mountain forests to grassland to desert scrub. It is drought tolerant. Description The leaves are entire and covered with fine to rough hairs, especially on the undersides. This is a taprooted perennial herb growing a hairy, glandular stem 20 to 60 centimeters tall. The branching, barky root may extend over two meters deep into the soil. The basal leaves are generally triangular in shape and are large, approaching 50 centimeters in maximum length. Leaves farther up the stem are linear to narrowly oval in shape and smaller. The leaves have untoothed edges and are coated in fine to rough hairs, especially on the undersides. The inflorescence bears one or more flower heads. Each head has a center of long yellowish tubular disc florets and a fringe of bright yellow ray florets, each up to 4 centimeters long. The fruit is a hairless achene about 8 millimeters long. Grazing animals find the plant palatable, especially the flowers and developing seed heads. Bright orange-yellow petals make the arrowleaf balsamroot easy to identify. Uses =Culinary and medicinal= Coming into season in late spring, all of the plant can be eaten—particularly the roots (boiled) and the seeds. It can be bitter and pine-like in taste. The leaves are best collected when young and can carry a citrus flavor. Many Native American groups, including the Nez Perce, Kootenai, Cheyenne, and Salish, utilized the plant as a food and medicine.University of Michigan - Dearborn, Native American Ethnobotany: Balsamorhiza sagittata The seeds were particularly valuable as food or used for oil. In 1806, William Clark collected a specimen near the White Salmon River, and both he and Frederick Pursh noted that the stem was eaten raw by the American natives. =Symbols= Under the name Okanagan Sunflower, it is the official flower emblem of the city of Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.

At the time of its opening, on May 26, 1905, it was claimed to be the largest park of its type in the United States. It contributed to Chicago's status as the city with the most amusement parks in the United States until 1908. It eventually introduced the world to the Goodyear Blimp, which was first assembled at the park. Background Time once used the park as point of reference for the city of Chicago. The park was located at 63rd Street and South Park Avenue (now Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive) and covered fourteen acres of land with gardens and strolling paths. There were several buildings all lined with white lights, from which the park took its name. One of the buildings housed a ballroom with a dancefloor large enough for 1,000 dancers. The park had a tower that could be seen for . The College Inn, a restaurant, could seat 2,500 diners at a time. \\"White City\\" was also the name associated with the landscaping and architecture of the World's Columbian Exposition, held near the same location in 1893 because the exhibition's buildings used plaster of Paris and were painted a chalky white. In its prime the park rivalled Coney Island as a model for worldwide amusement park architects, designers and planners. There was no general admission ticket, and patrons purchased tickets to use each of the park's features. Early history White City was originally envisioned to be like Dreamland, a park in Coney Island, Brooklyn that was widely praised for its amazing spectacles. The park's ambitious plan faced obstacles. The newspapers reported on the construction rush, which led to an incident in February 1905 when three plasterers fell from a scaffold, as they worked on a ceiling. After the park had opened, there was one occasion when a ride malfunctioned; a patron was killed, and two other patrons were injured. A year later, the park's roller coaster also malfunctioned, injuring twelve people. The new park's operation appeared as safe as similar parks, and almost from the beginning, White City was very well received. The city experienced dramatic increases in ridership on the public transportation that took people to White City. In August 1905, ridership on the South Side 'L' Train rose by 11,000 fares over the number of riders from a year earlier, an increase directly attributed to the opening of the park. 1950s and 1960s newspaper articles associated the park with an owner named Aaron Jones who was a Chicago entrepreneur who had been a successful operator of a penny-arcade business. Jones had visited the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and been so impressed that he aspired to create an amusement park that was similar to it.Jean Bond. \\"White City Dies As She Lived\\", Chicago Tribune, December 6, 1959, p. S1 Earlier 1905–1915 newspaper accounts had said the owners were two Chicago brothers, Morris and Joseph Beifeld. Morris was frequently called the president of the corporation that operated the park, and the 1910 United States Census states that he is President of the White City Amusement Park. Newspaper articles that reported declining business in 1911 called Morris the \\"President of White City Construction Company, which operates the Chicago amusement park.\\"\\"Chicago Amusement Parks\\", Wall Street Journal, September 16, 1911, p. 7. Joseph was the proprietor of the Hotel Sherman (originally called the Sherman House) but in an article about self- made millionaires, the Chicago Tribune noted that he was not only a hotel magnate but \\"principal stockholder in the White City Amusement and Construction Company.\\"\\"Chicago Produces a Millionaire a Week\\", Chicago Tribune, March 24, 1907, p. F7 Also in 1907, the Tribune referred to the White City Amusement Park's executives as \\"President Joseph Beifeld, Treasurer Aaron J. Jones, and General Manager Paul D. Howse.\\"\\"White City to Aid Tribune Babies,\\" Chicago Tribune, July 29, 1907 P. 6. Mr. Howse had been a journalist in Chicago, and his July 10, 1933 obituary stated that he was one of White City's founders and its first general manager. Admission was ten cents in the early years, and newspaper ads noted that White City was open rain or shine. In good weather, patrons could enjoy \\"...the spacious plaza, the outdoor sports and amusements\\", and if the weather was inclement, there was \\"...the excellent vaudeville show, the Chicago fire, ...the Baby Incubators, [and] the Wild Animals show...\\"advertisement in the Chicago Tribune, September 18, 1906, p. 9 In August 1906, the list of features at the park included these: Big Otto's Trained Wild Animal Show, Hale's Tours of the World, Flying Airships, Temple of Palmistry, Scenic Railway, Trip to Mars, Infant Incubators, Electric Cooking, the Midget City, and the Chutes.\\"Attractions of the Park\\", Chicago Tribune, August 4, 1906, p. 5 The park information mentioned a small Ferris wheel that had six cars and a miniature railroad. The park also featured the first Shoot-the-Chutes ride in Chicago. It also featured a roller coaster and the Garden Follies Dancers. The park featured regular outdoor concerts, and it had a roller rink. The park hosted burlesque shows, and performers like Annette Kellerman, Bill Cody and Sophie Tucker performed at the park regularly. Daredevil aeronautic shows of performers like Horace Wild were also common at the park. Midget City was a popular exhibit that featured 50 men and women who all had dwarfism; at the time, the word used to describe them was 'midgets,' and working the carnival circuit was one of the few jobs open to them. The exhibit showed a miniature city, with a miniature mayor, and even miniature horses. Also popular was the \\"Chicago Fire\\" exhibit, which featured an exhibit described as a faithful reproduction of the burning of the city: \\"... a panoramic display... in miniature, with all the addenda of realistic fire and smoke effects and crumbling of buildings...\\"\\"Ready for Babies Aid Day\\", Chicago Tribune, July 24, 1907, p. 8. Beginning in the summer of 1906, the Chicago Tribune newspaper made use of White City to hold an annual benefit for Chicago's hospitals, with the proceeds devoted to helping babies who needed care. In addition to the regular exhibits, there were well-known bands of the day that came to perform: for example, in August 1907, the Kilties, a Canadian band that played Scottish music, performed traditional Scottish folk music and folk dances. The Baby Incubators exhibit, a feature of several other fairs and parks of that time, attracted much attention and many donations. There is evidence that tiny infants were displayed at White City from the park's earliest days. The stories of the struggle for survival of these so- called \\"incubator babies\\" even made the west coast newspapers. (For example, a story of a 1-pound, 4 oz. infant from Indiana, called the \\"Tiniest Baby in the World\\", was written up in the San Francisco Chronicle, July 20, 1905, p. 2) At the time, not every hospital had incubators, and the Chicago Tribune was among the newspapers that used the Baby Incubator displays to raise money so that all hospitals in the Chicago area would have them.\\"Tiny Infants Taken to 'Tribune' Hospital\\", Chicago Tribune, July 26, 1905, p. 6 By 1908, another area amusement park, Riverview Park, was also involved in this cause.\\"Riverview Park Aids the Babies\\", Chicago Tribune, August 31, 1908, p. 12 From 1906 through 1920, a doctor, identified in some sources as simply \\"Dr. Couney\\", and elsewhere as Dr. M.A. McConey or Dr. M.A. Couney\\"White City Astir to Succor Babies\\", Chicago Tribune, July 29, 1907, p.5 maintained an exhibit of an incubator in which live infants were tended, including the daughter of the editor of the Chicago Tribune. In October 1910, White City served as the home of a major Christian evangelistic crusade. Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman and Mr. Charles M. Alexander made use of the ballroom, which seated nearly 4000, and they brought with them a chorus of several hundred people. The evangelists planned to make appearances all over the Chicago area during the month, but wanted to do something very memorable to begin their revival. They felt that White City was the place to launch the crusade in a very spectacular fashion.Charles W. Welch. \\"Meeting in White City Dance Hall Inaugurates Great Evangelical Campaign.\\" Chicago Tribune, October 16, 1910, p. B6. In late September 1911, White City experienced a serious fire, as flames swept through the southern section of the park. Newspaper reports said it started in a storage area near the railway, and it attracted a large crowd. A strong north wind kept the fire contained to the rear of the park, which prevented a nearby 200 foot tower in the center of the boardwalk from being destroyed. Firefighters were able to put the fire out without anyone sustaining serious injuries. The scenic railway and half of the Figure 8 took the brunt of the damage.\\"White City Fire Draws Big Crowds\\", Chicago Tribune, September 30, 1911, p.5 During the early 1920s, the park continued to be involved with charity benefits. A Chicago Tribune advice columnist whose pen name was \\"Sally Joy Brown\\" sponsored a children's event beginning in 1923. Sally Joy's column had become famous for getting readers to do good deeds to help the poor, and even children often participated in lending a hand. Now, the newspaper wanted to provide free access to the park for 100 lucky boys and girls who sent in the best letters explaining why they wanted to come to Sally's party and spend a day at White City. Many of the children who responded had never been to an amusement park. This content continued into the early 1930s, when the \\"Sally Joy\\" of that time was a woman named Anna Nangle.Louise Hutchinson. \\"The Tribune's Sally Joy to Retire Soon,\\" Chicago Tribune, December 26, 1960, p. 22 White City served as the place of assembly and departure point for the first Goodyear Blimp, called the \\"Wingfoot Air Express\\". Both B. F. Goodrich and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company assembled dirigibles at the park for the United States Navy. A dirigible serviced the park, bringing passengers from Chicago's Grant Park. On July 21, 1919, the dirigible run crashed into the Illinois Trust & Savings Building on LaSalle Street, killing twelve and injuring twenty-eight.\\"Blimp Bursts Over Loop; A 1919 Tragedy.\\" Chicago Tribune, July 21, 1957, p. D12 The pilot, John A. Boettner was saved by his parachute. He was arrested, pending an investigation of the tragedy, but later released without charges.\\"State and City Inquiry in Balloon Tragedy\\", Los Angeles Times, July 23, 1919, p.1 This crash resulted in the closure of the Grant Park Airstrip and the creation of the Chicago Air Park (currently Midway International Airport). There was another fire at the park in early July 1925, and although it did some damage, it was contained without any serious injuries.\\"Park Fire Imperils 15,000\\", New York Times, July 6, 1925, p. 24 A later fire in June 1927, however, was much more serious. Starting in the ballroom, it spread and did over $200,000 in damage; the tower that was not harmed in the 1911 fire finally was destroyed in this blaze. Some historians believe the 1927 fire signalled the beginning of the end for the park. Later history White City had experienced periodic financial problems because attendance was dependent on the economy. As far back as 1915, there had been a question of whether the park's lease would be renewed, but finally the landlord, Chicago business mogul J. Ogden Armour re-negotiated it and the park remained open.\\"Beifield Takes 98 Year Lease\\", Chicago Tribune, July 22, 1916, p. 14. But the Depression, along with the ongoing problems from the fires of 1925 and 1927, had a very negative impact on White City. Although 1930 still wasn't too bad for White City,\\"White City Park Draws Thousands\\", Chicago Tribune, June 29, 1930 with each successive year, attendance declined, and by 1933, the company that operated it was unable to pay the taxes that were due, causing the park to be placed in receivership. White City continued to deteriorate until it was condemned in 1939 and its facilities were auctioned off in 1946. In 1945, the land on which White City had stood was designated for a co-operative housing development for African-Americans. The irony, as reporters from black newspapers like the Chicago Defender quickly pointed out, was that the history of the White City Amusement Park had been one of de facto segregation. Black people were discouraged from attending during the park's early years. As far back as 1912, there had been comments that the name \\"White City\\" was very appropriate, given how it seemed to be a park for white people, and where black people served as objects of ridicule: one game was called the \\"African Dip\\", and it involved patrons throwing projectiles at the head of a black person, and trying to hit him. Black columnists were irate that some black men willingly took these kinds of jobs.\\"Men in Statue, Babies in Courage\\", Chicago Defender, July 27, 1912, p.1 Admission policies were desegregated when the neighborhood changed and more people of color resided nearby. The housing development was to be called Parkway Gardens, and at the time, it was seen as a hopeful sign that a neglected neighborhood would have new housing. The same anti-black policies that had beset the amusement park also applied to the roller rink at the park. The rink was still open, and during the 1940s, it became the site of demonstrations and brawls as Blacks fought for their right to roller skate indoors. In 1942, the Congress of Racial Equality was involved in one of these rallies. In 1946, the Congress of Racial Equality sued the management of the rink, saying it was violating the Illinois Civil Rights Law. Eventually, the White City rink was desegregated and changed its name to Park City. The Park City rink closed in 1958. Today, White City Amusement Park, which was once considered the equal of other turn of the century parks like Coney Island, is all but forgotten; but in its heyday, it was known as \\"the city of a million electric lights\\", because its tower was an amazing sight that could be seen for 15 miles.

Barros was born in Piracicaba, Brazil. He was the federal interventor in the state of São Paulo nominated by Brazilian dictator Getúlio Vargas, serving between 1938 and 1941. Following the re-democratization, he was elected Governor of São Paulo with a large margin in the 1947 elections, relying on a large coalition which included working-class support. Known to be a populist, he built a strong electoral machine, the Social Progressive Party (PSP), which dominated state politics until 1964. He was accused of being corrupt, but he was responsible for advances in social legislation and infrastructure: his candid supporters said \\"rouba mas faz\\" (he steals but he gets things done).Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 68.

After having lent support to Getúlio Vargas in 1950, he ran for President in his own right in 1955 and 1960. In the latter election he was placed third behind the eventual winner, Jânio Quadros who defeated him in the 1954 gubernatorial election by less than 1%.

The curriculum was heavily biased towards the teaching of religion, and it also had a strong emphasis on students learning the Ottoman Turkish language. After graduation, students were expected to continue education at Mekteb-i Sultani (Imperial High School) and then at Mekteb-i Mulkiye (School of Civil Administration), in order to be able to serve the empire in their native region. Initially only the sons of the Arab sheikhs and notables were permitted to enroll, however after petitioning by Albanian notables, in 1902 an imperial decree resulted in the enrollment of twenty students from the Albanian cities of Debree, Elbasan, and Yanya. Later Kurds were permitted to enrol also. The school was closed in 1907.

Early life He started his racing career as a Flat horse in Germany trained by Ralf Suerland and made his debut in a Listed race at Dortmund, which he won. He went on to have 3 more starts for the trainers, 2 of those in Group 3 class and the other in Group 2 class, where he finished 6th, 9th and 7th respectively.

The workshops operated from 1901 to 1978. Originally built by Charles and Edwin Millar on the site of the first timber mill in the area, the operations expanded to become the support facility for Millars' 26 timber mills and the rail network that connected them. The workshops hand-crafted most of the parts necessary to maintain the equipment rather than experience delays in obtaining parts from the United Kingdom. After suffering extensive damage from Cyclone Alby in 1978, Millars moved their operation to a site just outside the town on the South Western Highway. The site then changed ownership several times until it was bought by Bunnings in 1983. On 7 January 2016 the workshop, along with most of the townsite, was destroyed by a bushfire. History In 1895 the Millar brothers built a timber mill (?) on the site and as production increased the need to maintain equipment meant that the place was expanded to incorporate the various machinery workshops until 1901 when the site's sole function was for the maintenance of Millars equipment. During both World War I and World War II the workshops were converted to manufacture armaments. In the 1930s the timber industry in the region peaked with Millars operating 26 sawmills and an extensive private railway system to support them. The workshops became the centre of the operations employing over 100 people. The workshops included a foundry making the parts as necessary; as part of this is the largest collection of wooden patterns were made and are still retained on site in the workshops.

He won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for the film the King of Jazz.New York Times, 15 April 1965, p. 34. Early life  He was born in The Hague, Netherlands and died in Nyack, New York. Herman was the second child of Carel Rosse (8 March 1857 at Kassevitz - ?) and Jacoba, Susanna de Haan. The elder sister of Herman, Bertha, Suzanna (SUZE) Rosse (The Hague, 1 September 1884 – 17 April 1968) became a well known Dutch painter. Career  Hermann Rosse studied at the Academy of Art in The Hague and trained in architecture and design at the Delft Polytechnic School and the South Kensington College of Art in London. From 1908 to 1910 he attended Stanford University in California, earned his B.A. in architecture, and designed several residences. He spent much of the summer in 1909 at the nearby art colony of Carmel-by-the-Sea and contributed his paintings to the Third Annual Exhibition of the Carmel Arts & Crafts Club. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). From 1911 to 1913 he produced most of the decorative interior designs – including paintings, stained glass, tiles, and marquetry – for the Peace Palace at The Hague; and while working there he met his future wife, Sophia Helena Luyt (1891–1982), a landscape architect who was responsible for the design of the formal gardens.

The 92 mile (148 km) Midstate Trail passes through the state forest. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also conducts logging in some parts of the property. Geography Spencer State Forest is divided among three non-contiguous parcels. The most notable of these, located in south Spencer, is the Howe Pond parcel, an estate formerly belonging to Elias Howe, the inventor of the sewing machine. The Howe family of Spencer did much to make the town famous in the annals of ingenious Americans. William Howe of Spencer developed a wooden truss bridge named for him, his brother, Tyler Howe, patented a spring bed. Their nephew, Elias Howe, Jr., may well have eclipsed them when he invented the lockstitch sewing machine. The Howe Pond parcel (historically referred to as Howe State Park) includes a mill pond and dam constructed by the inventor. Swimming, once permitted is not currently permitted in the pond; lifeguards are no longer present in season due to State DCR cutbacks. The Howe Pond parcel also includes picnic tables and outdoor grills. The public restrooms have been shuttered for a decade. It is located off Massachusetts Route 31 via Howe Pond Road. Spencer State Forest Friends Group—The Friends of Howe Park and Spencer State Forest are members of The Massachusetts Forest and Park Friends Network, an independent grassroots organization of volunteer \\"Friends\\" groups working together to better protect and enhance Massachusetts’ state forests, parks, and trails. http://www.networkingfriends.net/resources.html Spencer State Forest Trails The 92 mile Mid-State Trail is the longest trail marked by yellow triangles and extends from Douglas State Forest at the Massachusetts/Rhode Island border in the south to New Hampshire. In Spencer, it enters from Charlton via Four Chimneys Wildlife Area on Borkum Road traversing Spencer State Forest sections on East Charlton Road, Ash Street, then leads off-street through both private lands and the forest to R Jones Road where it crosses a primitive parking lot continuing on through Spencer's newly designated Sibley/Warner Farm conservation lands through to Route 9 near the Spencer/Leicester Line. The Mid-State Trail ties Spencer State Forest parcels, Moose Hill and Buck Hill Wildlife Management areas, Sugden Reservoir, Thompson and Browning Ponds, Camp Marshall 4H Camp, Treasure Valley Boy Scout reservation, Sampson's Pebble geological feature and leads into the town of Oakham. In Spencer, Mid-State trail parking is roadside at East Charlton and I Capen Roads and in the Buck Hill areas. The trail north of Route 9 through Moose Hill Wildlife Management Area crosses picturesque Moose Hill levy pond created in the 1960s for flood control. Ski enthusiast/historians will note the former 1960s era Moose Hill Ski area referenced which ferried skiers on a hay wagon, truck bed and primitive rope tow up to the top of Moose Hill above the levy area. The upper section of Spencer State Forest is in northern Spencer, in the area of Turkey Hill Brook. A primitive lean-to for overnight campers is located on the property atop the 1,014 foot (309 m) drumlin Buck Hill. A parking lot is located off McCormick Road in Spencer. Areas comprising the Spencer State Forest and adjacent Wildlife Management Areas (WMA), Howe and Browning Ponds, Sugden Reservoir and the following entwined brooks present an outstanding array of water resources for serene intimate aquatic aficionado's enjoyment. Turkey Hill Brook flows from Paxton to Spencer in the northeast corner of town. \\"Dams were erected along the brook to power the wire mills that dotted this area, but the only remaining dam is the one that forms Thompson Pond. The brook joins the Seven Mile River northeast of Pine Grove Cemetery. The Seven Mile River originates in Rutland and was dammed to form Browning Pond. It merges with Turkey Hill Brook and connects to the Quaboag River in East Brookfield. Seven miles from Brookfield, the river served as a landmark when Brookfield was the only settlement between Worcester and the Connecticut Valley. Cranberry River flows from Charlton and was dammed to form Cranberry Meadow Pond in the southeast corner of town and dammed again to form Howe Pond at Howe State Park, joining the Seven Mile River near Route 9. The overall geography includes hilly terrain, creeks, wetlands, and transitional oak- hickory to northern hardwood forest types. The Depot Trail, Spencer's rail trail is a 2 ½‐mile walking trail along an abandoned railroad bed running from South Spencer Road to Chestnut Street, and connects into Spencer State Forest trails. There is lower section of Howe Pond with benches, fishing and portaged watercraft launching. Trail parking is adjacent to the railroad overpass parking on South Spencer Road. The Spencer Snowbirds Snowmobile Club, a private organization formed in 1972, maintains a network of snowmobile trails throughout the town, crossing both public and private property. Trail riding permits, membership and landowner memberships are detailed at http://www.spencersnowbirds.com/phpweb/ Howe State Park originated as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) legacy formed in 1933's height of the Great Depression, when newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first New Deal initiatives established the Emergency Conservation Work Act (ECW), popularly known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and/or \\"Roosevelt's Tree Army.\\" Both an economic relief and conservation program, CCC provided jobs for unemployed young men and veterans to support their families, while focusing on improving the nation’s open space and recreational resources. The CCC program in Massachusetts (1933-1942), was concerned with improvement and development of state park resources. Approximately 68 camps enrolled nearly 100,000 men. The CCC touched both the lives of these enrollees and their families and left a lasting legacy of state forest improvements and recreational resources still evident today. Massachusetts State Parks system was in its infancy when the CCC was established in 1933. Now, more than seventy-five years later, the work of the CCC still forms the cornerstones of the system as we know it today. Spencer State Forest, as many others, emerged from cut-over lands acquired for less than $5 per acre and largely inaccessible areas due to lack of roads and recreational facilities into being Spencer's community resource with beach, roads, trails, ponds, forest plantations and recreational facilities built by the CCC, and found in every region of the state. Currently the Howe Park area is mothballed.

It also is the final screen appearance of actor Clifton Webb. It is about a priest, Father O'Banion (William Holden), who arrives at a mission-post in China accompanied by a young native girl, Siu Lan (France Nuyen), who has joined him along the way. His job is to relieve the incumbent priest Father Bovard (Webb), who is now too old and weak to continue with the upkeep of the church. However, Mao's 1949 Communist soldiers, who arrive at the mission before Bovard can depart, seize it as a command post. Their leader, Ho San (Weaver Lee), rapes the girl and impregnates her, but later abandons his political beliefs. In the end, the four flee to the border, but are pursued by Communist forces along the way.Bosley Crowther: Satan Never Sleeps (1962). The New York Times February 22, 1962. Plot In 1949, Catholic priests O'Banion (Holden) and Bovard (Webb) are constantly harassed by the Communist People's Party at their remote mission outpost in China. Adding to Father O'Banion's troubles is the mission's cook, Siu Lan (France Nuyen), an attractive Chinese girl who makes no secret of her love for him. Under the leadership of Ho San (Weaver Levy), the Communists wreck the mission dispensary and desecrate the chapel. Ho San straps O'Banion to a chair and rapes Siu Lan; later, when she gives birth to a son, Ho San displays paternal pride, but refuses to stop persecuting the priests. Only after the villagers revolt and his superiors order the killing of all Christians, including his parents, does Ho San become convinced that Communism will never solve China's problems. He decides to smuggle Siu Lan, his son, and the two priests out of the compound, but their journey is halted within a few miles of freedom by a helicopter sent to prevent Ho San's defection. Before he can be restrained, the aged Father Bovard dons Ho San's military cap and coat and drives away in the colonel's car. He dies in a spray of bullets from the helicopter, but his sacrifice enables the others to escape. Later, at mission headquarters in Hong Kong, O'Banion officiates at the wedding of Siu Lan and Ho San and baptizes their child.Overview for Satan Never Sleeps (1962) Turner Classic Movies.

He preys on women who can provide for him. After meeting Samantha (Anne Heche) at a club he moves in with her, using his looks and sexual prowess to keep her happy. Before long, however, Nikki starts cheating on Samantha, first with his friend Emily (Rachel Blanchard), then with Christina (Sonia Rockwell), whom he met at another party. Emily disapproves of Nikki's free-wheeling lifestyle and has expressed a desire for a relationship, but Nikki has no real interest in her except for her wealth. Samantha catches Nikki with Christina, but they come to an uneasy arrangement where she will ignore his infidelity. While Samantha is out of town, Nikki meets a waitress named Heather (Margarita Levieva). He enlists his friend Harry (Sebastian Stan) to help him get Heather interested, but she does not fall for his charms. Although he eventually gets a date with her, she abandons him midway through the date. Soon after, Heather unexpectedly shows up in Nikki's pool and they end up having sex. The next morning Nikki is moving Heather's car and realizes it does not belong to her but to her \\"boyfriend\\", after she told him she was single. Nikki throws her out in anger. However, he cannot stop thinking about her, and his obsession frustrates Samantha to the point that she gets fed up and throws him out, quickly taking him back. Nikki, however, leaves on his own accord, still enchanted by Heather. Nikki searches for a place to stay, but has a falling out with Harry and cannot get into the parties he once did. He runs into Heather at a swanky hotel, and she admits that she was only interested in him because of his house, believing him to be rich. It transpires that she is the same as Nikki, scamming rich men for money in the same way he does with women. She lets him move in with her and her stoner roommate Eva (Ashley Johnson) and they begin dating, though Heather continues to scam and hustle, with some reluctant assistance from Nikki. One day, an upset Heather reveals to Nikki that she just broke up with her fiancé because she is in love with Nikki. She further tells him her fiancé's family owns the New York Rangers and that he is the one who has been paying her bills and living expenses. Nikki, who has also fallen in love with Heather, is nonetheless angry that she kept her engagement from him, and leaves the house in a huff. When he returns he only finds a note that says she has left for New York City. At Eva's urging and with Harry paying for the airfare, Nikki follows her. He finds her at a plush penthouse and begs her to come back to LA with him. She refuses, telling him she cannot afford to let him chase his fantasies around while she runs down the funds they would need to live. He then proposes to her, but she tells him that she is already married, breaking his heart. Heather says that she cannot get a divorce because she needs a marriage with stability and financial security. Her husband (Hart Bochner) returns home and Heather passes Nikki off as a grocery boy, dismissing him. Nikki returns to LA, finally seeing that life is worth the struggle, getting an honest job delivering groceries and living with Harry. He delivers groceries to Samantha's house, where they are picked up by the kept man who has replaced Nikki. The ending credits show Nikki feeding a mouse to Harry's African Bullfrog.

Made from flour and honey, they are thin, hard, and sweet. History Tirggel are first recorded in Zürich as Dirgel in 1461.For details see Schweizerisches Idiotikon, vol. XIII 1567 ff., article Tirggel. They have been manufactured there ever since with elaborately carved wooden moulds depicting Biblical or regional themes. More recently, the wooden moulds—four of which are exhibited in the Swiss National Museum—have been replaced by polycarbonate casts, which are easier to handle. Preparation Tirggel dough is composed of flour, 29 percent honey, some sugar and water; although one source reports that it is or was made without sugar, which is taken to be an indication of the tirggel's pre-Christian origins. The dough is pressed very thinly into elaborately carved moulds of varying shapes and sizes. The biscuits are baked in a high- temperature oven at for only 90 seconds and require good timing to get right. Consumption Because tirggel are hard and dry, they are best when sucked on for a while, which allows the honey flavour to become more pronounced. Tirggel are also very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger reported in 1939 that \\"the tirggel has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it to nibble on.\\" On account of their elaborate ornamentation, traditionally manufactured tirggel are often not eaten at all for months or years and are kept as decorations instead.

He also played Australian rules football with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Leather, who was born in Scotland, played 16 games and kicked 11 goals for North Melbourne in a brief career which encompassed the 1932 and 1933 VFL seasons. He then appeared in four first-class cricket matches for Victoria in 1934 and 1935, taking 14 wickets at 26.07. On the back of these performances, he was picked to tour Ceylon and India with the Australian cricket team in 1935–36. Australia's Test team was touring South Africa at the time so this was a second string side. As a result, the matches against India, which Leather took part in, were given first-class status but were not Test matches. After going wicket-less in their match against Ceylon, Leather went to India and played in all four 'Tests'. He took 21 wickets in those matches, taking five wicket hauls in Calcutta and Lahore to finish the Indian tour with an impressive 47 first-class wickets at 17.25. This made him Australia's most successful bowler for the tour after Frederick Mair and Ron Oxenham.

Created by Shōji Kawamori and Thomas Romain, the series aired on MBS between April and October 2009. The anime is licensed by Maiden Japan. Plot The story takes place in the world of \\"Earth Dash\\", an alternate, futuristic version of Earth where human society split between the far more advanced lunar society and that of the planet's surface. A popular sport is BFB (Big Foot Basketball), where players ride mecha called \\"Big Foot\\" and play basketball in a giant arena. In the city of Rolling Town, Dan JD and his companions take the sport to the streets, rename it \\"Basquash\\", and then embark on a journey to overcome their past hardships and make their dreams come true. Characters =Main characters= Team Basquash ; : The main protagonist, Dan is a young boy who loves basketball but despises BFB due to an accident that crippled his sister. His attempts to demoralize the sport ended up making it more popular when he invaded an official BFB game and awed the crowd with a highly skilled demonstration under his alias, \\"Dunk Mask\\", on his own Big Foot which he named Dangan. As a result of the widespread destruction, he is imprisoned for a year and charged with a massive debt, numbering 5.3 billion Rollings (the local currency). This event, as well as Dan himself, has since then gained the status of a legend, and inspired the sport Big Foot Streetball. His dream is to make enough money to pay for his debts and send his sister to the moon to treat her paralyzed legs. He has developed a strong rivalry with Iceman, as an opponent and as an ally. Near the end of the OCB tournament Dan realizes Rouge's feelings for him, after she played against him without reinforcement medication, in an attempt to keep her play honest, which resulted in her losing consciousness in the middle of the game. As she left for the moon, he made a promise to eventually travel to the moon himself, asking her to wait for him, hinting that he may have developed feelings for her. Dan is able to throw a \\"thunderbolt ball\\", a basketball that shines with a 'radiant light that traced a shape of the heavens creation'. For this, he is believed to be the Legend, the one destined to save Earthdash and Mooneyes. At the end of the series, it is revealed that he is not the Legend; everyone who is a 'basquasher' (a term for Basquash players that he coined) is a part of the Legend. Using their combined skills and their own 'thunderbolt balls', the 'basquashers' reactivate the ultimate in Mooneyes, by throwing a 'final dunk', bumping Mooneyes back into orbit, effectively saving Earthdash and Mooneyes, as they were previously in a collision course with each other. In the aftermath, all that is seen of Dan is him about to play basketball with Iceman, affirming that he will continue to play, and that he has not lost any passion in basketball, and possibly Basquash, either. ; : A skilled basketball and BFB player with the nickname of \\"Platinium Gale\\". She likes to be abused, but hates weaker men and is looking for a well suited match. She believes Iceman to be this special man and on one occasion has ask for his “genes\\". When Dan played at the official BFB game one year ago, she claims to have believed him to be \\"the one\\" as well. She has been shown to have some affection for Dan, though it may have faded. It is later revealed that she is the daughter of a wealthy business-man, whose family later disowned her mother and herself, since she was a female, and not able to become an heir. For as yet unexplained reasons, her mother later died. She resents her family and her father for both abandoning her mother, and only watching her as she died. After their departure from Turbine City, she learned that her father was killed. Her reaction is mixed, on part with her past hatred of him, and the fact that she can't deny the fact that despite their past, she still sees him as a father. After the Old Timers began talking to her about her father, it is revealed that her father may have had other personal and possibly more benign reasons for disowning her. She has since come to peace with her father's memory. Upon meeting Navi, she reveals feelings that go deeper than just \\"wanting his genes\\", a dogma she had kept with all other males she had been attracted to. However, she states that she does not like nor dislike him; it is just the fact that he is too big for her. Towards the end of the series, she dismisses this previous statement, and acknowledges her feelings for Navi, regardless of their difference in size, during the final moments of the Legend Tournament. Together, they participate in the 'final dunk', along with Dan, Iceman, Rouge, Falcon,and Flora contributing their part of the Legend. In the aftermath, she is being looked after by the Old Timers in Turbine City, with Navi. Navi and Sela are together, playing Basquash, happy, and possibly in a relationship with each other. ; : A vicious BFB player with a shrouded past who holds a grudge against Dan. He is also known as \\"The Frozen Inferno\\". Skilled at long shots, he beats his enemies by throwing balls at them with crushing speed, while shouting “Destroy!”. These balls, once thrown, take on a dark blue color, due to its strength. This is later revealed to be his own, personal \\"thunderbolt ball\\". He wears blue glasses and has dark red eyes. His savage game play contrasts vastly with his personality off the Big Foots: normally, he is portrayed as a cool and polite person. It was later learned, in a rather unorthodox manner by Dan, that the Destroy balls he throws at his teammates (causing them to be victims of these vicious projectile) are actually passes. This can be interpreted that Iceman cannot let go of a ball without it becoming a \\"Destroy Ball\\" while playing. He has a grudge against Falcon Lightwing, who threw him out of their BFB team, causing Iceman to fall from grace. Some time after his fall from grace, Iceman's original left arm and left leg were cut off by Price of Hell in the Underground, causing him to lose his title of \\"Legend\\". It has been confirmed that he was one of the people before Dan believed to be the Legend. After his amputation, Thousand replaced his limbs, giving him his robotic left arm and left leg. Since joining Dan, Iceman has matured considerably, going so far as to forgive Falcon. This fact is more apparent when he makes a Basquash team with Falcon during the Legend Tournament. They are the only ones with a team of two; later, the third spot is filled by Slash Keens. He becomes the co-spokesman of the Legend Tournament, urging all Basquashers (more specifically, Dan) to come to Mooneyes and participate. In the final moments of the Legend Tournament, when Mooneyes' ultimate failed to activate after Dan's dunk, Iceman urged Dan to continue playing, regardless. Dan joined him, and together, they formed the lead to the culmination of the Legend, using Yang's Legend Bullet as a basketball and dunking it, as their 'final dunk'. In the aftermath, he is seen waiting for Dan, as they are about to start a one-on-one basketball game, showing that he will continue to play basketball, and possibly Basquash. ;/ : A foreign princess who was awed by the three-way match between Dan, Sela and Iceman during her passage through Rolling Town. She seems to have some sort of supernatural '6th sense' claiming to sense \\"destiny on the wind\\" when the above were playing their match, as well as when she sensed Iceman's rage as he destroyed a statue of Dunk Mask. Flora eventually runs away to Rolling Town to chase after these voices. She takes up playing Basquash and pretends to be male under the assumed identity of \\"Alan Naismith\\", named after the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. To be on par with the rest of the group, she was coached in playing basketball by Coco. It is later revealed that the voices she hears, with her '6th sense', are 'the stones'(ultimate) and ruins of Earthdash speaking to her, and that this ability runs in the royal family of Skybloom. Her father, King Regalia, is currently not able to hear the stones, however. For most of the series, she remains under her guise of Alan Naismith, though during the course of the series, she learns that none of the girls are fooled, and only the boys in the group remain ignorant of her gender. Much later in the series, she and Dan were threatened by her own soldiers. As a reaction to this, she drops her guise and subdues the soldiers. Though Dan was the most oblivious to her gender, he says, once she reveals her real name, that he doesn't mind, since she is a 'basquasher' like everyone else. She goes with the rest of the group to participate in the Legend Tournament, but at the last moment, she realizes that her level is too inferior to keep up with everyone else. In tears, she asks Rouge to replace her. In the final moments of the Legend Tournament, she hears the voices of 'the stones' once more, and realizes that the Legend Bullet is made of ultimate. With this information, Rouge is able to catch the Legend Bullet and hand it to Dan and Iceman for the 'final dunk'.She is seen later playing basquash with Falcon in the \\"Final Dunk\\" In the aftermath, Flora is seen in traveling gear on Earthdash, possibly traveling throughout the world. ; : A moon giant whose ancestors were brought to Earth Dash to mine ultimate in the Underground because it was poisonous to humans but not them. He is called Navi for short. He wears a suit that is as big as a Big Foot, possibly to provide him protection from the ultimate due to his weakened resistance to its poisonous effects. He protected his friends' graves until Dan found him and introduced him to the world of Basquash and told him that his friends would not want him to spend the rest of his life protecting their graves. He is now the newest member of Team Basquash as well as the only member of the team who does not need a Big Foot to play (mainly because he is roughly the size of one). Also, he has not been able to play in many official games, since the group did not want to attract attention. Sela has since developed feelings for him, though she ignored them. At first, he did not reciprocate, but eventually developed feelings for her as well. Although he did not participate in the Legend Tournament, he appeared during its final moments to deliver tennis shoes to Dan, who had burned off the ones he used during the Tournament. He then went on to give his own part of the legend in the 'final dunk', along with Rouge, Dan, Iceman, Falcon, Flora and Sela, with whom he shared the dunk. In the aftermath, he is seen with Sela, playing Basquash, happy, and possibly in a relationship with her. ; : Dan's pet/partner with shape shifting abilities that looks like a gremlin. He usually transforms himself into a set of earmuffs/headband or the trademark mask that Dan uses to hide his identity as the delinquent “Dunk Mask”. Alternatively, he can turned into a restricting face-cover (his friends had Spanky do this when Dan wouldn't shut up, knocking him out with flatulence). Spanky seems to have a very similar personality to Dan, and it is understandable why the two would get along – albeit in a rather violent and argumentative fashion. He has also been known to give Dan a heads- up now and then which helps him avoid being completely surprised by some surprise attacks. Spanky is always hungry, and is said to be able to eat almost anything, regardless of size or material. Similarly to Dan in his boasts, Spanky boasts that he would be able to eat anything - even the world (though he says that it would be quite a mouthful). In the aftermath, he is seen with Dan, who is about to engage Iceman in a one-on-one basketball match. ; : Sela's pet/partner who looks like a white snake and is usually seen coiled around her left arm. Crawley also sometimes acts as a \\"person\\" for Sela to talk to. She is often a voice of reason to Sela, and acts quite coolly compared to Spanky, who always overreacts. Though she is always seen with Sela, she has a much smaller role than the other characters. In the aftermath, she is seen, as always, with Sela. ; Iceman's pet/partners with shape shifting abilities, who look like salamanders. They usually take the form of Iceman's glasses. When Iceman appears on screen without his glasses, Righty and Lefty can usually be seen nearby. It is not known if they can speak, though, seeing as Spanky and Crawley, creatures that seem to be related to each other and to Righty and Lefty, it is possible. ; : Flora's pet/partner who acts as her guardian. He resembles a hair ornament and when he is not on her, takes the form of a butterfly. He frequently acts as Flora's caretaker, announcing her when she dropped her disguise in front of her soldiers. He has a wife, Baaya, who acts as the pet/partner of Flora's sister, Aulora. =Staff= ; : Dan's childhood sweetheart who moved away from his neighborhood when they were children. She returned in the first episode as a well endowed teenager and a skilled mechanic. Upon her return she gives him and teaches him how to pilot a BigFoot. She cares for Dan and his team's Big Foots, something she does happily, as it gives her more work to do (and get paid for). She also has been shown as having deep feelings for Dan even though he doesn't notice them. Later, she redesigns the team's BigFoots, making them move much faster and smoother than before, enough to create an afterimage. Though she is not a basquasher, she is still an irreplaceable part of the team, constantly fixing and upgrading all of their BigFoots. Though she has feelings for Dan, she steps aside once Rouge comes into the picture, and accepts their mutual attraction. She did not participate in the Legend Tournament, but she did go with everyone, and did the finishing touches on the BigFoots. Her upgrades were overwhelming; the shoes that Haruka made for Dan were burned off after he pushed the BigFoot to its limits. In the aftermath, she is seen working with her grandfather on an orange BigFoot (it is highly probably that it is Dan's), showing that she will continue to be a mechanic. ; : One of Dan's friends and former accomplices during the Dunk Mask era – he sold the parts of the TV's they vandalized. He also gave the group the idea of giving the Big Foots sandals made of tires when he brought a large amount of human-sized tire sandals for them to deliver. Haruka took an interest on him because his head looks like a foot. He is shown to be a good salesman, and frequently disappears on Haruka's orders to conduct business elsewhere. In the aftermath, he is seen selling things at a store. ; : An overweight friend and former accomplice of Dan. He studies various aspects of the buildings in Rolling Town and dreams of becoming an architect. He frequently directs Dan's routes around town. As Bel reportedly knows everything about every building in Rolling Town, he can create \\"safe\\" delivery routes (Dan was destroying buildings while delivering packages). He also helps Dan out with his new playing strategy, setting up markers around town with him before the match with Sela and Iceman. He carries around a set of goggles. After being thrown in jail after the moon cannon incident, Bel quickly lost weight due to the bad prison food. His loss of weight was so drastic that Ganz told him to write a diet book, though he said that no one would willingly lose weight on prison food. After his release, he quickly regains his weight by overeating frequently. In the aftermath, however, it is seen that he has once again lost weight, and now works in a desk job. ; : Miyuki's grandfather and a skilled technician from the moon. Haruka revealed that he was formerly a mechanics professor there, possibly of some renown. Recently it has been discovered that at one point in time he worked with Thousand and Yang on researching ultimate. He where the one who made the bigfoots after years of studies of the ultimate when he worked for lunatic corporations. After the death of his son when they studied a new way to develop the bigfoots he stopped his work as an engineer for lunatic corporations. ; : A shoemaker from the moon, Haruka came to Rolling Town interested in Dan and Co.'s BFB skills. She develops special basketball shoes for their Big Foots in order to promote her business. She also has a fetish for feet (unintentionally tickling Dan mercilessly while caressing his feet between her breasts upon their first encounter) and has the ability to read people's thoughts just by looking at their feet. She is well endowed due to her being from the moon (referred to as the \\"Lunar Bust\\") and the low gravitational force, allowing her bust to develop to an abnormally large perfectly spherical size. Her shoes contain NIKE's famous swoosh logo. Eclipse ; : Referred to as 'Idol Red', Rouge is a pink-haired member of Eclipse, a musical group from the moon and a street Bigfoot Basketball team. She's shown to have a spunky, rebellious attitude, apparent when she runs away from her manager and the press, eventually involving Dan in her escape by kissing him to hide her face. This, however, was caught on camera, and started the rumor that she was dating 'Dunk Mask'. Later on, she, along with the rest of her teammates, participates in a match against Dan, Iceman and Sela, one of Team Basquash's many traveling/fugitive matches. In the match, she receives a few slight injuries, to which she disregards, until she receives a particularly strong blow; Dan then dismounted his Bigfoot and carried her so she could receive medical attention. She later reveals to her teammates that she has developed feelings for him because of this action. During the OCB tournament, Rouge didn't take pills to enhance her performance when they played Dan. During her and Dan's match she collapsed and, later, was sent back to the moon, but not before hearing Dan's feelings toward her. ; : Referred to as 'Idol Yellow', Citron is the blond-haired leader of the lunar musical group/street BFB team Eclipse, and she presents herself as the most childish of them. She admires Iceman, commenting on how cool he is. ; : Referred to as 'Idol Purple', Violette is the well endowed, violet-haired member of the lunar musical group/street BFB team, Eclipse. She plays on the 'older sister' role of Eclipse, often giving advice and consoling her teammates. King of Kings ; : Iceman's Rival. ; ; Skybloom Kingdom ; : ; Others ; : Dan's little sister, whose legs were crushed by a Big Foot, and has since used a wheelchair. Dan claims that she used to be a better basketball player than him, and was severely affected when he learned she could no longer play. Sometime after the incident, when she is in the hospital, she tells Dan that it's his fault that she became cripple because he didn't make the dunk shot. She treats her brother coldly and seems indifferent to him, despite his many attempts to bond with her. This act, however, is only a front; in reality she cares greatly about him, only projecting the cool demeanor since Dan has not yet been able to understand her true feelings regarding the incident. She is the \\"Ultimate Bystander\\", her net alias for her status as an internet blogger who continually writes about Team Basquash's and Dan/Dunk Mask's endeavours. She has been described to be 'uncannily accurate' in these blogs, reflecting her frequent following of Team Basquash. ;/ : A former basketball player and the president of the BFB league, James loves sphere-shaped things such as bubbles and Haruka's Lunar-bust, and is often seen blowing bubbles out of a pipe. His bubbles are often seen before you actually see him. His alter ego, Mister Perfect, is an identity James Loane invented for himself so he could help out Dan and company without letting them know his true identity. His tools range from a rocket launcher to a basketball he can throw with pin-point accuracy. ; :, Katsuyuki Konishi (Past) Slash is a mysterious person who apparently ages in reverse. He met Dan, Coco, and James when they were young. He is very skilled at basketball and has been seen with Coco. He has also brought her to the moon just as he promised he would. He is also the Chairman of the OCB. He is revealed later in the series to be Ascend, King of the Moon, and elder brother of King Regalia of the Skybloom Kingdom. He became young again using a secret family technique utilizing ultimate. He was also the one who introduced Dan and Coco to the game of basketball, and the one who trained James Loane, also starting his obsession with spherical objects. By the end of the series, he sacrificed himself to protect Mooneyes against the Legend Bullet created by Yang Harris. He reverted to a child, given to the care of Coco JD. ; : A skilled mechanic from the underground who hates Miyuki's grandfather. She was also the person who found Iceman after his left arm and left leg where cut off after which she built him his robotic left arm and leg. ; : The main antagonist and is the manager of Eclipse and the general manager of lunatic corporations. He is trying to create a legend. But to do this he has to get Dan away and he was the one who had fixed so the capsule to mooneye was shot into a wrong orbit and landed close to the underground.

He was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 1963, but his career was ended by injury before he could run again. Background Bred by Louise Clements, he was out of Hasty Girl, a daughter of two-time Leading sire in North America, Princequillo. His sire was To Market, a multiple top stakes race winner who set several track records and whose sire, Market Wise, was the 1943 American Co-Champion Older Male Horse. Hurry to Market was purchased at the Keeneland Sales by New Orleans oilman and Fair Grounds Hall of Fame inductee Roger Wilson and the daughter of his business partner, Mrs. T. P. Hull, Jr. He was trained by former jockey David Erb. Racing career His strong juvenile season was capped off in a major race for two-year-olds in mid-November when he defeated Roman Brother in winning the Garden State Stakes and then survived a protest from John L. Rotz, the rider of the runner-up. Never finishing worse than third, Hurry to Market's performances in 1963 saw him voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by the Daily Racing Form and the Thoroughbred Racing Association. The rival Turf & Sports Digest poll was topped by Raise a Native. Going into the 1964 racing season, Hurry to Market was rated at 125 pounds on the Experimental Free Handicap, ahead of Northern Dancer who was assigned 123 pounds. With Raise a Native retired due to injury, Hurry to Market was the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby.

Starring Nitin Sethi, Amar Kakkad, and Nandita Thakur, it is often described as India's first gay film. The film was thought to have been lost for 40 years, but a print was found in 2019.  Plot  Set in Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, Badnam Basti tells the story of Sarnam Singh, a bus driver who is also a bandit. Sarnam saves Bansuri from being raped by another bandit. Bansuri falls in love with him, but he is jailed for a petty crime. Upon release, Sarnam searches for Bansuri but does not find her. He then meets Shivraj, who works in a temple, and hires him as a cleaner in the bus. The two become physically and emotionally intimate. Sarnam again encounters Bansuri, who is now living with Sarnam's crony, Rangile, who won her at an auction in a village mela. Bansuri desires to return to Sarnam, but he is torn by his longing for Bansuri and his love for Shivraj. Shivraj, however, goes on to marry Kamala. Rangile, who is a police informant, is convicted and jailed for duplicity in legal matters. As the film ends, Sarnam takes Bansuri and her newborn to his home. Cast * Nitin Sethi as Sarnam Singh * Nandita Thakur as Bansuri * Amar Kakkad as Shivraj * Nandlal Sharma Production The film is based on (A Street with 57 Lanes), the debut novel of the Hindi writer Kamleshwar Prasad Saxena which was originally titled Badnam Basti and serialized in the Hindi journal Hans in 1956 and published as a novel in 1957. Badnam Basti was produced by the Film Finance Corporation on a budget of 250,000. It was shot in a four-week period at Mainpuri. The theme of homosexual interest between the two male characters caused Kamaleshwar's novel to attract controversy; Prem Kapoor had to excise scenes from the novel and make their relationship only suggestive in order to receive clearance by the film censorship board. Although it is labelled as India's first gay film, Badnam Basti neither explicitly depicts nor identifies the male characters as gay. They are bisexual rather than gay, and their relationship is secondary to their heterosexual relationships. Songs The music for Badnam Basti was composed by Vijaya Raghava Rao and Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan. Khan, who previously worked with Rao in Bhuvan Shome, sang \\"Sajna Kaahe Nahi Aaye\\" for the film. Lyrics were by Virendra Mishra and Harivansh Rai Bachchan; Bachchan recites the poem \\"Mele Mein Khoi Gujariya\\" in the film. Rao and Satish Bhutani also sang in the film. The sound recording was done by Narinder Singh. Following is the list of songs in Badnam Basti: Release and reception The film was released with an \\"A\\" certification from the Central Board of Film Certification. It received mixed reviews. Avijit Ghosh writing for The Times of India called it \\"a welcome step forward in the direction of 'new cinema' in India\\". The Economic Times noted that \\"Badnam Basti presents a true picture of reality\\". However, a review by Indian magazine Link penned \\"no film at all – its technical gimmicks are totally out of rhythm with the insipid directorial conception\\". Rajika Kirpalani in his book Another Time, Another Place wrote: \\"little more interesting than the hotchpotch that passes for films generally\\", and that it \\"sustains its interest merely because of Nitin Sethi, who truly infuses his character with hardy, virile, rural verve\\". Sethi received praise from The Illustrated Weekly of India, which commented that \\"Sarnam's loneliness has been projected superbly by Prem Kapoor. It is hard to imagine anyone but Nitin Sethi in the role\\". Re-release and lost film status Originally edited by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the film did not do well at the box office. It was re-edited by Kapoor and re-released in 1978 with a \\"U\\" certificate, but was a commercial failure again. The film was thereafter thought to be lost with no prints available in India, but re-emerged in 2019 when a print was located in the archives of the Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art, Berlin. It has since been digitized and was screened by the Block Museum of Art in May 2020 and at the Kashish film festival, Mumbai.

The clots are on the scale of millimetres to centimetres and may be interspersed with sand, mud or sparry carbonate. The larger clots make up more than 40% of a thrombolite's volume and each clot has a complex internal structure of cells and rimmed lobes resulting primarily from the in situ calcification of the cyanobacterial colony.

He was acquitted, but the Government disregarded the decisions and escorted him to Erzurum, however he was detained at Diarbekir by its Vali due to the Russian presence preventing them from reaching Erzurum. Initially he was imprisoned at Diarbekir for twenty-two days, after which he remained at Diarbekir for six and a half months, witnessing and hearing of the atrocities committed by the Turks against the Armenian people. El-Ghusein then fled as described in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, written by the British soldier T. E. Lawrence:  Martyred Armenia  Audio recording of Section 3 of Martyred Armenia, by Faiz El-Ghusein. The section describes methods of massacre adopted by the Turkish Gendarmes and authorities. Faiz El-Ghusein was exiled to Diyarbakir under the suspicion of supporting the Arab Revolt. While in Diyarbakir, El-Ghusein witnessed the massacres of Armenians in and around the area. El-Ghusein wrote much of what he witnessed in his book Martyred Armenia which provides an eyewitness account of the massacres and exposes its systematic nature. The account was originally published in Arabic in 1916 under the title \\"Massacres in Armenia\\" but was changed to Martyred Armenia under its English translation. In the foreword of the book, El-Ghusein states, \\"The war must needs come to an end after a while, and it will then be plain to readers of this book that all I have written is the truth, and that it contains only a small part of the atrocities committed by the Turks against the hapless Armenian people.\\" He wrote of the massacres and their opposition to Islamic principles as follows: The mistreatment of the Armenians in the name of Islam distressed him greatly, and he expressed concern about how his faith was being used to justify the brutality: He is buried in El Sharaeh, a village in Ottoman Syria.

The old cinema had 250 seats on the first floor and another 200 on a balcony. The cinema is not without its critics. Many Palestinians boycotted the cinema, claiming that unmarried men and women slept together in the cinema's guest house, and drank alcohol there. Audience numbers dwindled. Following death threats that were circulated in the mosques in early 2011, many foreign nationals were evacuated from the Cinema Jenin project, at the request of their governments. The project The renovation was carried out as an international charitable effort intended to encourage a culture of cinema-going for the inhabitants of Jenin by showing films of various genres, including fiction films, documentaries, comedies, children’s films, Arabic classics and contemporary movies. It is planned to have six screenings along with other activities every day. A website has been created to present the various activities of the cinema.

Once a prosperous herring fishing port, tourism is now important to the local economy. Location Stege is near the centre of the island at the mouth of Stege Nor, a lake which connects directly to the sea at the town. The mouth of the lake is now spanned by a bridge. Etymology Stege originated as a small fishing village called Dybsbroen, on the coast just north of the eastern end of the bridge, along the street now known as Dybsbrostræde. The current name may derive from Stickae or Stike, which were wooden poles rammed into the sea inlet as a further defence against raiders. History The Mølleporten town gate in the 19th century The town received status as a merchant town in 1268 under Eric V of Denmark but there were already fortifications protecting the fishing community early in the 12th century.Stege - Møns \\"hovedstad\\", Retrieved 24 May2010. As the town grew, a fortress was constructed on the coast just south of the mouth of the inlet, in the 13th century.\\"Stege Borg\\" Retrieved 24 May 2010. Construction costs for the town's fortress were paid for by money from the fishing of herring, the town's most important source of capital. Around 1430, a defensive wall was constructed enclosing the landward side of the town which was otherwise bounded by the sea to the north, and the lake to the south. The wall was built on top of a rampart, with a moat so that the town was entirely surrounded by water. Three gate towers were constructed, one on each of the major roads passing through the wall. Only the Mill Gate (Mølleporten) now survives. It was converted into a prison when the remainder of the wall was demolished around 1685. What remains is one of the best preserved fortresses in the Nordic countries.\\"Stege\\", Den store Danske Retrieved 24 May 2010.

Herring fishing was also in decline, and as a result of the multiple disasters the population fell drastically. Around 1800, merchant shipping blossomed in Stege, with the deepening of the harbour, and the building of warehouses nearby. Fine merchant estates of the time can still be seen in the area. \\"Stege\\", Turistblad.dk, Retrieved 24 May 2010. In 1883, a large sugar factory opened on the southern side of the harbour.

Known as \\"the cathedral of The Broads\\", the church dates from the 14th century, although with origins in Saxon times. It contains a major collection of medieval artefacts, in particular the rood screen and the Ranworth Antiphoner, a liturgical manuscript. The church remains an active parish church and is a Grade I listed building. History Known as \\"the cathedral of The Broads\\", Historic England's listing records describes St Helen's as of the 15th century, although other sources date it to the 14th. Pevsner records roof beams bearing the date 1370. Restoration took place at the end of the 19th/early 20th centuries to prevent complete collapse. A fire in 1963 destroyed the thatched chancel roof, but otherwise caused \\"little damage\\". The significance of the church lies mainly in its late medieval decoration, particularly of the rood screen. Simon Jenkins considers the work \\"England's finest church screen paintings\\". The Twelve Apostles are represented in painted panels on the rood screen itself, with a total of 26 saints and bishops shown in panels elsewhere in the church. Pevsner dates them to the 1470s or 1480s and describes their \\"superb quality\\". St Helen's remains a functioning church in the parish of Ranworth with Panxworth. Architecture and description The church was begun in the Decorated Gothic style of the 14th century, although Pevsner notes the predominant influence of the Perpendicular style of a century later. It is of Rubble construction with Clipsham stone dressings. A three-storey tower, at the western end of the church, is followed by a nave, with two porches, and a chancel. Beyond the interior paintings, Jenkins considers St Helen's as \\"of limited architectural interest\\". The interior also contains a field altar, used during World War I by the Reverend Teddy Everard, subsequently vicar of Ranworth, as well as a memorial panel commemorating the 14 men of the parish killed in the war.

Krishnan and Nazir Hussain. The film stars Mehmood and Leena Chandavarkar. It is a remake of the 1964 Tamil movie Server Sundaram. The role played by Nagesh in Tamil version was reprised by Mehmood in the Hindi version. Plot Sunder (Mehmood) works in a hotel owned by Ram Swarup (David Abraham) as a waiter. He is a very funny, uneducated man, with a suitably funny face, in contrast to his name. Radha (Leena Chandavarkar) is the daughter of Ram Swarup. She often comes to the hotel, and Sunder happens to meet her and amuse her with funny jokes. One day, in a casual remark, she says: \\"I like your innocence\\". He does not understand the word \\"innocence\\", and thinks that she likes him. He also likes her, but is afraid to tell her, as he works in her father's hotel. Then, he seeks help from his friend, Amar (Biswajeet). He helps him get work in the film industry. And in no time, Sunder emerges as a leading comic actor. But at this time, Amar, ignorant about his friend's love, and Radha fall in love. When he knows that Sunder's love is Radha, he asks Radha, who says that she never loved Sunder. Amar stops Sunder multiple times from expressing his feelings to Radha, thinking that the truth will break Sunder down. During his stardom days, he once performs at a charity show for orphaned children. He gets emotional seeing the children, and decides to stay a day longer, and in the process, misses his father's death ceremony at his home. His mother asks him to be with her in her last moments, and he promises to. One day, during an interview to the All India Radio, he says that he likes to have his old waiter uniform in front of him, so that it could remind him of what he was earlier, so that he would not develop any pride. And in the same interview, he says that he is going to marry someone he loves. Amar and Radha listen to this on the radio. Knowing that Sunder will come to express his love for her, Radha urges Amar to tell him the truth, but he says, he is unable to do so. Sunder comes, and Radha tells him the truth. Heartbroken, Sunder wishes well for his friend, and Radha. Then, one day, he goes for the shooting of the climax of a film, whose date of release has come very near. The producer says to his guard that nobody, under any circumstance should disturb them. And back home, his mother falls down the stairs. She is rushed to the hospital. She wants to see her son, so, a man is sent to call him, but the guard does not allow him in. Instead, he himself goes to get some good medication. Sunder, after finishing the work, comes to know about the accident, and rushes away. But he finds her dead. He regrets being a celebrity. Amar and Radha marry. At that ceremony, Sunder comes in his old uniform, of a waiter. He says, he will no longer work in films, as that life is unreal. He will meet with his mother from now onwards, by helping poor and orphaned children.

It is composed of an igneous intrusion of syenite, and became an island when canal locks were built so boats could avoid the falls. It is known for its large deep potholes as well as being popular with local rock climbers. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1976. Efforts by the local community to turn Moss Island into a New York State Park were begun in 2008. Description Moss Island is long and wide. It is bordered by the Mohawk River on the north and the New York State Barge Canal to the south. It is covered in dwarf oak trees. Glacial striations are visible in some places. The southern cliff at its highest point is tall. The cliff has an adjacent road and spans about three-quarters of the island. Geology The cliffs of Moss Island are composed of metasyenite. Syenite is an igneous rock, similar to granite, composed of crystals of quartz (SiO2), alkali feldspar (a continuous mixture from KAlSi3O8 to NaAlSi3O8), and plagioclase feldspar (a mixture from CaAl2Si2O8 to NaAlSi3O8), with small quantities of muscovite (common, white or potash mica), biotitic (black mica, an iron rich version of muscovite), and hornblende (a black to dark green crystal mixture of calcium-iron-magnesium silicate, aluminum-iron-magnesium silicate and iron-magnesium silicate). The prefix \\"meta-\\" indicates that metasyenite is a metamorphic rock. After forming as an igneous rock, the syenite was subject to massive heat and pressure, which caused the minerals to rearrange, but not melt. History The first locks around the waterfall were created in 1793. A dry 19th century Erie Canal lock (Enlarged Erie Canal Lock #36) is located next to the southeastern service road. The current Lock 17 is one of the tallest locks of its type in the world and the largest in the New York State Barge Canal system. The lock uses a guillotine gate on its eastern side. In 1974, the New York State Thruway was planning to build a bridge over Moss Island, but after negative publicity, it was rerouted around the island. Recreation Moss Island is known for its rock climbing. It also provides access to disabled fishermen. The island connects to Lock 17, and its operation can be viewed from the island. A walkway next to the guillotine gate is available to cross the canal. Admission to parking, the lock and Moss Island is free. The island is known for its circular rock formations, and the opposing side of the island is a popular rock climbing cliff. =Rock climbing= Moss island is frequently referred to as an outdoor gym. With a huge range of very easy to very hard climbs, and a very short approach Moss Island is a convenient place to climb. From the base it's no more than a 5 minute walk to set up an anchor. The cliffs are clean and have great protection with over 100 established routes ranging from 5.1-5.13. Many more popular routes are bolted for top rope. Goat Crack (5.2), a slab, is a classic Little Falls route where many trad climbers do their first leads. The island has had several famous climbers climb here including Lynn Hill. Across from the island is an unmaintained cliff with a visible crossing crack Crucifix (5.8). Further down stream a former cement factory has the dihedrals, a face. This cliff is privately owned and not open to the public. See also *List of National Natural Landmarks in New York References * Childs, G., & Thomann, G. C. (2012).

The film stars Mehmood and I. S. Johar. Synopsis Johar Mehmood in Hong Kong is an intelligence satire, the basic of all I. S. Johar films, in which it is left to the viewer how he interprets the scenes with laughter or introspection. The film is the story of two conmen, Ramesh (I. S. Johar) and Mahesh (Mehmood), whose only life purposes are to make the most money by cheating and theft. They land in the hands of a high-profile Portuguese dictator (Kamal Kapoor), who wants to blow up India with the formula of an atomic bomb, a Nuclear weapon developed by a scientist of Hong Kong, who is killed along with his daughter by high treasonous thieves in the hope of securing the formula, which, however, the scientist has already secured in a safe deposit locker in the Bank of Hong Kong. Coincidentally, the scientist's daughter is a look-alike of a girl called Ms. Sonia / Usha Roy (Sonia Sahni), who the dictator wants to act as the deceased patriotic daughter, go to the bank using her identity and take out the formula, to be later secured by him, and misused against India. For this, he makes Mr. Pran (Pran), his CID officer to be close to Sonia as her engaged partner, after she wins the Beauty contest of Miss Bombay. Simultaneously, he orders another of his cronies, Ramayan Tiwari, to pursue Ramesh and Mahesh, that they should also become the love interests of Sonia, so that she could be brought to Hong Kong on some pretext or the other. The story takes a turn when Mahesh really falls in love with Sonia, while posing as a blind man, out to win her sympathies, but not before she realizes the truth and is totally hurt, that he tried to cheat her as a blind man. Repentant Ramesh and Mahesh now becoming totally patriotic, decide to go to Hong Kong with Sonia and catch the culprits who want to inflict such drastic harm to India. How they manage to do this is a hilarious masterpiece, which can be understood only after watching the movie! Cast *Mehmood as Mahesh / Ms. Dhanwanti / Panditji *I. S.

Services from BVA are available to all veterans who have become blind, either during or after active duty. The BVA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. BVA is a 503(c)(3) registered nonprofit; for the 2008–2009 Fiscal year, BVA's income was $4.2 million. Mission The Mission of the BVA is: * To promote the welfare of blinded veterans so that, notwithstanding their disabilities, they may take their rightful place in the community and work with their fellow citizens toward the creation of a peaceful world. * To preserve and strengthen a spirit of fellowship among blinded veterans so that they may give mutual aid and assistance to one another. * To maintain and extend the institution of American freedom and encourage loyalty to the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the states in which they reside. History The BVA was established in 1945, at the end of World War II, by young veterans who had lost their sight in combat and were recovering together at an Army hospital in Connecticut. In 1958, the BVA was chartered by the U.S. Congress (Title 36, Chapter 303) to \\"speak and write on behalf of blinded veterans in national legislative affairs\\". In addition to its legislative role, BVA has 52 regional groups that help veterans find services such educational services, counseling, peer support, and rehabilitation services. Currently, the BVA membership is about 11,000, but BVA services are available to any blinded veteran, regardless of membership status Programs and services Based on VA data, there are estimated to by more than 158,000 veterans in America that suffer from severe vision impairment or blindness. According to the BVA, 13% of wounded U.S. military troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered a serious eye injury. In addition, approximately 7,000 veterans become newly blind or visually impaired from non-combat related causes. Field Service Program The BVA employs seven full-time Field Service Representatives, who have been strategically placed in different geographical areas throughout the United States. Their goal is to locate and assist blinded veterans in overcoming the challenges inherent in sight loss. Since all of the Field Reps are legally blind veterans themselves, they can be effective role models in demonstrating that fellow veterans can take charge of their lives. Field Reps are responsible for linking veterans with local services, assuring that the newly blinded take advantage of VA Blind Rehabilitation Services, and assisting them with VA claims when necessary. When blinded veterans are ready to return to the workforce, BVA Field Reps can assist them with employment training and placement. Operation Peer Support BVA's newest program, Operation Peer Support (OPS) establishes connections between newly blinded veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with veterans who went through a similar transition following World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. These older blinded vets know the many challenges facing newly blinded service members, and can provide unique insight and understanding, having once faced similar challenges themselves.

It is a significant work of the Indian Parallel Cinema movement which started during the 1950s with filmmakers Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. The film was forgotten soon after its release, but was rediscovered and is today considered a landmark work of Indian cinema. The film stars Aditi and Anil Pandya.  Synopsis  The film is set in a provincial town in Northern India, at a time following the nation's independence in 1947 when India was yet to be completely integrated as a political entity and when Nehruvian socialism was about to take on the existing feudal hierarchy. Taran (Aditi) is the daughter of a wealthy landlord (Anil Pandya) and lives with her father and her widowed aunt (Kanta Vyas) in their ancestral mansion (which goes on to represent the whole of upper class in the film). The town is witnessing protests by newly formed labour unions which are partly being politically educated by the local railroad engineer (Iqbalnath Kaul), who seems to have an unspoken romantic relationship with Taran. Taran's unseen brother, who had, to the chagrin of their father, renounced his class privileges and gone off to an Assamese tea estate, asks Taran to join him. Stuck in a stifling patriarchal order, with pressure to marry an upper-class groom mounting, Taran decides to talk to her father about her plans.  Cast  * Aditi * Anil Pandya * Kanta Vyas * Iqbalnath Kaul Soundtrack #\\"Aaja Ri Nindiya\\" - Vani Jairam  Rediscovery and Appreciation  After its original release in 1972, Maya Darpan won the Filmfare Award for Critic's Choice Best Film, but was quickly forgotten soon after. In an interview with Shahani, Rafique Bhagdadi and Rajiv Rao reveal the initial reaction to the film: \\"Despite the lavish praise it received abroad, Maya Darpan (1972) met with hostile reception in India. Critics panned it for its excessively languid pace. Others found the film to be too European in its sensibility. Those who expected poverty of metaphysics were disappointed.\\" The film was rediscovered through independent film enthusiasts in India dedicated to bringing Indian Parallel Cinema to the forefront of serious critical artistic discussion. The movie found a revival amongst film enthusiasts. A film blog, The Seventh Art, stated that \\"We are now at a point where even the original negatives of the film face the risk of extinction. One can only hope that institutions like the World Cinema Foundation will do something about it. Kumar Shahani's Maya Darpan is a seminal work in Indian Parallel Cinema not just because it canvasses critical social issues (a facet that, more or less, in hindsight, has become a characteristic of the movement) but also because it attempts to seek out a new aesthetic, which does not try to straddle mainstream cinema and art cinema, to do that.\\"  References   External links  Maya Darpan review 1972 films Indian films 1970s Hindi-language films 1972 drama films Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography National Film Award Best Hindi Feature Film National Film Award winners ","title":"Maya Darpan"},{"id":"20581311","text":"Mere Bhaiya is a 1972 Bollywood drama film directed by Satyen Bose.

He was known for his prolific output with Warner Brothers, contributing, in such films as Little Caesar (1931), and Gold Diggers of 1933 to the distinctive Warners look and style. According to a TCM profile, he showed a \\"flair for harsh realism, Expressionistic horror and ornate romantic moods alike\\". He was born Antoni Franciszek Groszewski in Kiełbasin, Poland and died in Stanton, California. He studied at the Krakow art academy and at technical school in Königsberg, Germany, majoring in interior decoration, illustration, and design. He changed his name and emigrated to the U.S. in 1909. The Lubin Company hired him to paint and design sets in 1913, in Philadelphia; and he also worked on films for Vitagraph and Pathé. At the Pathé company, he developed his innovative techniques, along with William Cameron Menzies, in the way of using continuity sketches. His method of presenting a series of sketches of all the film’s sets would later become standard practice among Art Directors, particularly with Menzies (his assistant in 1917, on The Naulahka). The cinematographer Arthur Miller remembered Anton Grot: > \\"a gifted and talented artist who made beautiful charcoal drawings...of the > set before it was completed. All his compositions showed a full shot of each > set, with all the delicate tones and shadings that suggested ideas for > lighting and, in general, were of great help to me as a cameraman.\\" Grot arrived in Hollywood to assist Wilfred Buckland with the sets for the Douglas Fairbanks Robin Hood (1922); and stayed on, to work with Cecil B. DeMille and William K. Howard. He was eventually signed by Warner Bros., as “art director, artist, and designer\\", and designed 80 films before his retirement in 1948. Grot collaborated notably with fellow émigré, director Michael Curtiz, on 15 films.

Brief 55. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States. In Latin America, agroecological practices have a long history and vary between regions but share three main approaches or levels: plot scale, farm scale, and food system scale. Agroecology in Latin American countries can be used as a tool for providing both ecological, economic, and social benefits to the communities that practice it, as well as maintaining high biodiversity and providing refuges for flora and fauna in these countries.Altieri, Miguel A. \\"Part 1.\\" Agroecological Innovations: Increasing Food Production with Participatory Development.

Due to its broad scope and versatility, it is often referred to as \\"a science, a movement, a practice.\\" cacao plantation where the Ixcacao Mayan Belizean Chocolate company grows and produces chocolate using Mayan techniques.  Background  = History = Agroecological methods have been practiced in Latin America for centuries, but the term agroecology in reference to the combination of agronomy and ecology was coined in 1928 by B.M. Bensin in the U.S. Until the 1960s, it mainly focused on the scientific aspects of agronomy and ecology and remained relatively unknown. However, due to the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of pesticides and the burgeoning environmental movement in the1970s, agroecology gained momentum globally and began to integrate a much wider range of issues on top of ecological ones, such as the social, political, economic implications of agroecosystems. In this context, the scientific aspect of agroecology began to engage in dialogue with traditional local farming practices and experimentation in many regions. The relationship between agronomists and traditional practitioners, often subsistence farmers, has been termed an \\"exchange of wisdoms.\\" In Latin America specifically, agroecology spread more widely during the period of structural adjustment policies in the 1970s. In this time, many Latin American countries took up loans from the International Monetary Fund with strict conditions of trade liberalization that allowed large transnational corporations to grab large swaths of land and out-compete local markets.\\"The role of Agroecology on the future of agriculture and the food system\\", Sociedad Científica Latinoamericana de Agroecología, 2017. While many small farmers were negatively impacted, many others have joined together to form cooperatives, social movements, or global organizations.  Benefits  Traditional farming systems of Latin America were forged from a need to subsist on limited means. These techniques were developed from centuries of cultural and biological evolution by combining experiences and methods of other peasant farmers using locally available resources. Due to its origins Latin American, agroecology represents a low impact form of agriculture. Modern agriculture had become a process of \\"artificialization of nature\\" producing a monoculture of a very few crop species. Agroecology contrasts industrial agriculture in its use of polyculture, lack of synthetic fertilizers, minimal machinery and incorporation of successional stages. Agroecology attempts to benefit both people and the environment by maximizing crop yield, but also preserving the natural environment. It is often practiced by forming agroecosystems which are communities of plants and animals interacting with their physical and chemical environment that have been planted and harvested by people. = Economic benefits = Agroecological principles allow farmers to save many in several important ways: becoming independent from large corporations' inputs such as GMO seeds and fertilizers; having a more diversified and thus more resilient crop system where income does not depend on one single crop; using simple, cost-effective techniques to increase productivity; having solidarity markets with local communities and thus a steady source of income; having a democratized method of knowledge and seed exchange. Specific examples of economically successful agroecological systems include stabilizing hillside farming in Honduras. World Neighbors, an NGO, partnered with Honduran farmers to implement a program that helped practice soil conservation using techniques such as drainage and contour ditches, grass barriers, rock walls, and organic fertilization (e.g., use of chicken manure and intercropping with legumes). These changes allowed for an increase in grain yield of three to four times more than in previous years as well as supplied 1,200 families with grain. Another example, from the Andean region in Peru where a partnership of NGOs and locals lead to the implementation of a Pre-Columbian indigenous technique called Waru Warus. This technique involved raising the fields and surrounding them with dug out ditches filled with water, which regulates the soil temperature allowing for an extended growing season. In the district of Huatta, this method of using waru-warus have increased annual potato yields by 4-10 metric tons per hectare. A final example from the Andean region where some peasant communities in Cajamarca and NGOs planted more than 550,000 trees and reconstructed terraces as well as drainage and infiltration canals. This change allowed for about half the population in the area - 1,247 families - to have land under conservation measures. For these people, potato yields have increased from 5 to 8 tons per hectare and oca (wood sorrel) yields have jumped from 3 to 8 tons per hectare. Intercropping coffee and tomatoes = Ecological benefits = The benefits of agroecology are not only economic, but also important ecologically. There is evidence to indicate that the agroecosystems with overstory shade trees like coffee or cacao plantations can rival the biodiversity of natural forests. The diversity is so high in these systems because the overstory is structurally and floristically complex which allows for many different niches to be available resulting in refuges. It is possible that shade coffee plantations are already serving as refuges, as seen in Puerto Rico where tremendous deforestation has occurred and yet the avian extinction rate is relatively low. Another system that is ecologically important is neotropical kitchen gardens. Kitchen gardens or home gardens are common in tropical and subtropical areas and they provide food and income for the family. Some kitchen gardens like the Mopan Mayan of southern Belize contain dozens of tree and plant species of different stories mimicking a natural forest. These patches, much like shade plantations, serve as refuges for flora and fauna such as in Belize where they are used by migratory birds. Agroecological farms and methods also contribute to reducing the effects of climate change as they have more plants and thus greater carbon sequestration as well as limited emissions from farm management and crop transportation. Agroecology in Latin America also includes many ecological areas such as water conservation, soil health, and maintaining seed diversity, among others.La ViaCampesina's Brochure. Web. October 20. 2017. viacampesina.org https://viacampesina.org/en/la-via-campesina-organisational-brochure- edition-2016/ = Social benefits = The principles of agroecology are also cultural and social. Agroecology is the “transformation of rural realities through collective action” for the goal of food sovereignty. Thus it is not just science and principles, but also a practice, which produces many social benefits as it is a combination of efforts between farmers, social movements, scientists, and NGOs, as well as occasionally local governments. Food sovereignty is a core component of agroecology that increases social power. The definition of food sovereignty as defined by La Via Campesina, the social movement that articulated it, is the following: > \\"Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally > appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to > define their own food and agriculture systems. It develops a model of small > scale sustainable production benefiting communities and their environment. > Food sovereignty prioritizes local food production and consumption, giving a > country the right to protect its local producers from cheap imports and to > control its production. It includes the struggle for land and genuine > agrarian reform that ensures that the rights to use and manage lands, > territories, water, seeds, livestock, and biodiversity are in the hands of > those who produce food and not of the corporate sector.\\" Thus, when communities, NGOs and the public move beyond the view of food security, i.e. having enough to eat, and transition to the framework of food sovereignty, much more progress can be made in ensuring people's well-being. Farmers then have control over how their food is produced, what is produced, and where it is sold, which must primarily be in local markets. Thus consumers also have close ties to the production process. A key component of the agroecological method used to achieve food sovereignty is campesino-a- campesino, or farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange, which is an effective way to strengthen social relations within and between communities. Similarly, the collaboration between researchers from universities and farmer research projects allows farmers to have greater social standing than in industrial agriculture where they are simply told what to do. Additionally, indigenous customs and knowledge are highly valued, whereas they have historically been considered irrelevant by most agronomists and \\"development experts\\". Through the agroecological techniques that produce a higher and more diverse overall crop yield than industrial agriculture, small-scale farmers are able to be self-sufficient and at the same time produce excess to sell in local \\"solidarity markets,\\" i.e. places where they have loyal customers. This is an effective form of poverty reduction because the greatest cause of poverty in rural Latin America is not having enough income from crops. With agroecological methods such as crop diversification, crops are much more resistant to drastic and unexpected effects of climate change, thus farmers' livelihoods are less vulnerable. Another important social benefit is the part of agroecology that emphasizes agrarian reform, i.e. transitioning back to small-scale farms where farmers own their land vs. being workers on large, corporate-owned industrial farms. Social movements in Brazil such as the Landless Workers' Movement (MST) have successfully re-acquired land for subsistence farmers and farmer cooperatives.  Role of social movements  Social movements play a significant role in the movement of agroecology in Latin America, which emerged in the scene of growing neoliberal globalization beginning in the 1970s. In this period, trans-national corporations began dominating the agricultural sector, causing food shortages, excess dependence on imports and agricultural inputs. It was in response to these effects that many social movements in Latin America formed. One of the most prominent movements is La Via Campesina, an umbrella organization that connects many local farmer groups and movements. It began in 1993 when farmer representatives from four continents convened in their first conference, with many representatives from Latin America. it is now present in 73 countries all over the world, representing around 200 million farmers. La Via Campesina was the first to define food sovereignty at the World Food Summit in 1996. It began by demanding land for farmers through occupations, but soon expanded its goals to a much wider range of issues. Now its main goals are: defending food sovereignty, struggle for land and agrarian reforms; promoting agroecology and defending local seeds; promoting peasant rights and struggle against criminalization of peasants. It has also expanded its work to increasing communication and consensus with other users of land, conducting research, expanding its organizations that deal with legal support for occupations, and confronting negative stereotypes of occupations in the public eye. They hold an International Conference every four years, which is \\"the movement’s highest body for political discussion and decision-making, where future actions and agendas are defined.\\" There have been such conferences since 1993, guiding the many other networks of action that members engage in around the world. Another large movement is the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or MST in Brazil. MST has been and continues to be one of the largest peasant- lead forces that drive agrarian reform. During the time of Presidents Lula and Cardoso, who prioritized agribusiness, little progress was made. But MST's alliance with La Via Campesina and its fight for agrarian reform explicitly tied to territorial issues still makes it a major driver in these questions: anywhere where there was successful reform, MST—the peasants themselves—were involved. Paradoxically, however, although MST and other organizations are relatively successful in acquiring land, simultaneously large agribusinesses are grabbing pieces of land from the Amazon. In general, there are several trends present in Latin American peasant social movements. First, peasants have developed a political consciousness and identity even across borders. Second, they share the conviction that small scale agroecological practices actually have higher efficiency, resilience to climate change, and increased food security and sovereignty. Third, they engage in five major battles against agribusinesses: * control of nature for sustainable local use * the right of smallholder farmers to produce for livelihood and communities around them not for profit * the fight for food sovereignty * keeping GMO seeds out and allowing their own control of genetic diversity * making production and market networks sustain the local needs.  Role of research  Hand in hand with the work of social movements is the work of researchers at various universities throughout Latin America. There are now many agroecology departments throughout the continent, although they often struggle with limited funding and resources compared to large agronomy departments. One example of an organization that promotes agroecological research alongside dialogue with farmers is the Sociedad Cientifica Latinoamericana de Agroecologia (SOCLA), or Latin American Scientific Society of Agroecology. SOCLA organizes conferences every year in various locations in Latin America, where farmers, students, and researchers share knowledge, seeds, practices, and formulate strategies for the future.  Examples by method  = Shade Coffee = Shade-grown coffee is an ecologically and economically important agroecosystem in which coffee plants are grown in the understory of a tree canopy. The shade of the canopy over the coffee shrubs encourages natural ecological processes and species diversity. These shade coffee plantations are in many Latin American countries including Brazil, Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Shade coffee growers maintain complex coffee agroforests in which they produce coffee and manage the area's biota. Shade coffee differs from the industrial open sun coffee plantations that increase faster coffee growth and reduce costs but result in decreased biota resources, refuge, nutrient cycling and increased broken terrain and soil erosion. Studies have been done in Latin America to prove the biological importance of shade coffee. In 1996, a scientific journal discussed the evolving industrial coffee plantation effects on Northern Latin American countries. Areas of high deforestation where traditional shade coffee methods are used have been found to be a crucial refuge for many biota. Another study in Veracruz, Mexico on shade coffee ecological relationships found that areas of lower cloud forest that are now coffee plantations are also a microclimate for native orchids and pollinators.Coffee shadow trees Costa Rica = Shade cacao = Some cacao is now grown in cabrucas, an agroforestry system found in Belize, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil, in which cacao is grown underneath the canopy of mixed native trees. Cabrucas are largely run by smallholder farmers. As with shade coffee, the forest canopy for cacao production has been found to provide a diverse ecosystem. An example of the biological importance of cabrucas can be found in Brazil's main cacao production region Southern Bahia, Brazil. A 2008 study of biodiversity conservation in cacao regions found that the cabrucas in Southern Bahia are used by a significant proportion of native flora and fauna. Due to parts of the region experiencing high deforestation and fragmentation, these cabrucas are providing habitat, fragment connection, and edge effect reduction. Another study in Costa Rica on the role of these cacao plantations in maintaining avian diversity found that the plantations do not substitute for a forest but do provide a home for a large number of avian generalist species.  Some examples by country  = Cuba = Cuba is an extremely unique example of successful agroecological transformation on a national level. In the beginning of the 20th century, Cuba was devastated socially and ecologically by industrial agro-inputs and chemicals and northern crop dumping, but the socialist revolution did not change that as large-scale industrial agriculture was still prioritized. Thus, once Cuba reached a crisis in the 1990s, it was determined to restructure its food system to emphasize smaller farms, local production, national and local self-sufficiency and food sovereignty.Funes-Monzote, F.R., Monzote, M., Lantinga, E.A. Van Keulen, H. (2009). Conversion of specialised Dairy Farming Systems into sustainable Mixed Farming Systems in Cuba. Environment, Development and Sustainability. 11, 765-783. What followed was what is now known as Cuba's agroecological revolution, where small-scale farmers now produce more than 65% domestic food using only 25% of the country's land, most using agroecological methods. Its success lies in the dynamic grassroots organization of peasants with other peasants. These improvements in organization and adoption of agroecological methods over time have increased productivity dramatically, and thus also food sovereignty, as well as resilience to climate change.Rosset, P.M. et al. (2011). The Campesino-to-Campesino agroecology movement of ANAP in Cuba: social process methodology in the construction of sustainable peasant agriculture and food sovereignty. The Journal of Peasant Studies. 38:1, 161–191. =Mexico= La Secundaria Técnica número 34 in Jojutla became the first middle school in the country to give classes in agroecology.

He joined the faculty of the Georgia State Political Science Department in 1998.Michael Herb's website Kuwait Politics Database On his website, Dr. Herb manages a database on key political figures of Kuwaiti politics. All in the Family In 1999, Herb published All in the Family: Absolutism, Revolution, and Democracy in the Middle Eastern Monarchies. The book's central thesis is that the main reason for the resilience of Arab monarchies is not oil wealth or the lack of a middle class, but because numerous members of the royal family hold key positions in government. The book has become a regularly cited piece in the comparative politics literature of democratization, authoritarianism, and rentier states.

Biography Chin was the son of a carpenter who left mainland China for a brief stay in Cuba, and then permanently settled in the 1920s in Jamaica. As a teenager in the early 1950s, Vincent oversaw the stocking and maintenance of jukeboxes in the island's bars for Isaac Issa, a prominent Syrian-Jamaican businessman. He kept the excess and replaced records and used them to open up his Randy's Records store on the corner of East and Tower streets in Kingston in 1958 on (the name coming from an American record store that sponsored an R&B; radio show that could be picked up on the island).Katz, David (2003) \\"Obituary: Vincent 'Randy' Chin\\", The Guardian, 22 February 2003 His son, Clive Chin, explained: \\"He kept dem records, and that was the springboard of his business, y'know?\\".Stratton, Jeff (2003) \\"Chin Music: How one little record shop climbed to the top of the reggae world\\" Miami New Times, 10 April 2003.

By the early 1970s, engineer Errol Thompson had upgraded the studio with more modern equipment, and Clive took a lead production role, with the house band, \\"Randy's All-Stars\\", including among its members Wailers bassist and keyboard player Aston \\"Familyman\\" Barrett and Tyrone Downie, drummer Sly Dunbar, and a young keyboard player named Horace Swaby, later better known as Augustus Pablo. The studio proved popular with many of Jamaica's leading producers. Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry recorded several tracks there with Bob Marley and the Wailers 1970–71, and other major stars to record there included Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, Burning Spear, and Johnny Nash. The studio was later upgraded to 16 tracks, and was used by Vincent's eldest son Clive to record Augustus Pablo's This Is Augustus Pablo debut album in 1973. The Chin family expanded their business interests into the United States, with the opening of branches of Randy's run by Vincent's brothers Victor and Keith. The family later began pressing records and moved into distribution. In 1979, Chin closed the Randy's studio and moved to New York and with his wife Patricia, opening the VP Records (the initials of Vincent and Patricia) store and label in Queens.

Harrison was born in Muswell Hill, Middlesex, and was the third son of Frederick Harrison, a stockbroker, and his wife, Jane Brice. He was educated at King's College School and King's College London. In 1858 he entered business as a solicitor at the firm of his uncle, also named Charles Harrison. He acquired a large practice in his own right, with major clients being the London Chatham and Dover Railway and the Law Fire Insurance Society. He became an advocate of the rights of tenants to purchase their properties and of the provision of housing for the working classes. In this he was in agreement with the policies of the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. In 1886, he married Lady Harriet Barlow. His active involvement with politics came with the creation of the London County Council in 1889. He was elected as one of the council's first members, representing Bethnal Green South West as a member of the Liberal-backed Progressive Party. He was a leading member of the council, and vice-chairman from 1892 – 1895. His interests in the government of the capital led him to call for the municipalisation of the London docks and the unification of the City of London with the county. On two occasions Harrison stood for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons on behalf of the Liberals. In 1892 he failed to be elected at Plymouth. He stood again at the ensuing general election in 1895, and became one of the town's two members of parliament, while continuing to hold his seat on the London County Council. Harrison became suddenly ill with inflammation of the throat at the funeral of Sir Frank Lockwood on 23 December 1897 and died at his London home on the following day from heart failure.

The son of musician Harry Evans, Evans left his studies in music at age 18 years to pursue a career in medicine. With Sir Arthur Ellis of the London Hospital Medical College, he worked on Bright's disease and on the relationship between nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys) and hypertension (high blood pressure). Evans was the personal physician to King George VI and conferred with Sir Clement Price Thomas during the king's illness and famous lung surgery in 1951. Historian Peter Hennessy says, \\"he was probably the leading general physician of his generation.\\" However, in 1953, he referred foreign minister Anthony Eden for an operation, from which Eden's health never fully recovered, an operation which has been the subject of much discussion.Peter Hennessy, Having it So Good: Britain in the Fifties (2007) pp 408-9. One of his daughters died in an accident at a young age and both Evans and his wife died in 1963, leaving the barony extinct. Early life and education Evans was born and grew up in Dowlais near Merthyr Tydfil, the son of the prominent musician Harry Evans and Edith Gwendolen (née Rees).https://biography.wales/article/s2-EVAN-HOR-1903 He received his early education at Liverpool College.Who Was Who, Published by A&C; Black Limited. Online edition, 2020 His younger brother, Hubert, became a diplomat, ambassador to Nicaragua between 1952 and 1954. His family soon moved to Liverpool when his father was offered the role of conductor of the Liverpool Welsh Choral Union and therefore Evans was sent to Liverpool College for his education. Following the death of his father, he took up studies at the Guildhall School of Music at the age of 12 years and subsequently went to the City of London School. By the age of 18 years, he decided on a career in medicine, and with a science scholarship, studied at the London Hospital medical colleg from 1921 to 1928. In 1925, he acquired the conjoint diploma of MRCS, LRCP. This inspiration to pursue a career in medicine possibly came from his grandfather who was a pharmacist. Early career Becoming assistant to the medical unit at the London Hospital by 1929, Evans developed a close connection with Sir Arthur Ellis and Clifford Wilson. However, his first attempt at MRCP was not successful and he had to retake in 1930. During the same year he acquired an MD. His first job was as house physician to Sir Arthur and he was supported by Sir Arthur right from the beginning of his career. He then gained a wide range of clinical experience by taking up posts in surgery, obstetrics, anaesthetics and pathology. By 1933, Evans was the medical unit's assistant director. He was selected as assistant physician at the London Hospital in 1936. By 1947, he was full physician. Together with Sir Arthur, they became renowned for their work on Bright's disease and the link between hypertension and nephritis. During the war, this research was presented by Sir Arthur in the Croonian lectures of 1941 at the Royal College of Physicians. The royal physician Evans continued his career at the London Hospital and became physician to Queen Mary in 1946, following the death of Lord Dawson of Penn and at the recommendation of Lord Webb-Johnson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was later physician to her son, King George VI from 1949, receiving a knighthood (Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order) in the same year. and to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, from 1957. In addition, in 1957 he was created Baron Evans, of Merthyr Tydfil in the County of Glamorgan. Evans was part of the team that looked after King George VI during his ill health with lung problems and up until his death.  Evans and Anthony Eden  The gallbladder operation of Anthony Eden in 1953 has prompted much debate. Eden had been unwell with upper abdominal pains since 1945. Frequent attacks of pain requiring strong painkillers and periods of rest prompted more extensive investigations. An X-ray demonstrated gallstones, and Eden being an important politician, the royal physician was called for advice. In light of recurrent biliary tract infections, Evans recommended an operation. Three surgeons were recommended and the ultimate decision, taken by Eden, was that John Basil Hume, surgeon from St Bartholomew's Hospital was to perform the surgery in 1953. Hume had previously performed Eden's appendectomy. It is agreed that the initial operation resulted in biliary tract damage, a complication well recognised at the time, and much corrective surgery was needed later by Richard Cattell, again a recommendation of Evans. That the surgery should be done in the United States was objected to by Winston Churchill, who felt that if the king had his operation on a \\"kitchen table',\\" Eden could at least have his in a London hospital, but Evans and Cattell visited them at 10 Downing Street and agreed the transfer abroad. During the Suez Crisis, Evans was consulted on numerous occasions by Eden. On Eden's visit to New Zealand in 1957, Evans made notes for doctors should he require medical assistance whilst abroad: \\"His general health during the past year has been maintained with extensive vitamin therapy—sodium amytal gr 3 and seconal enseal gr 1.5 every night and often a tablet of Drinamyl every morning. These treatments have only become really essential during the past six months. Before his rest in Jamaica the general condition was one of extreme over-strain with general physical nerve exhaustion, and at this time he seemed to be helped by rest, some increase in the sedation and Vitamin B.12 therapy’.\\" Family Evans married Helen Aldwyth Davies in 1929. She was the daughter of a former High Sheriff of Glamorganshire who spent much of life unwell. The younger of their two daughters died by accidental electrocution. Both Helen and Evans died in 1963. He died in October 1963, aged 60, when the barony became extinct.  Personality  Towering and marginally slouched, he wore horn-rimmed glasses and enthused confidence in those who sought his advice, whether patient or colleague. Calm and composed during a crisis, his opinions were highly regarded.  Legacy  Evans will be remembered as one of the most widely known physician names of his time along with Lord Dawson of Penn and Lord Horder. He has been widely quoted as the \\"last of the great physicians\\". In a speech in 1958 he stated: \\"Have you noticed how your patients watch you with an intensity rarely given, even to an actress? Every word you utter, every action you make has a special significance for good or ill, which carries an impression perhaps undreamed of. A sick patient is peculiarly sensitive to any word or action which is not completely sincere. The slightest suggestion of any insincerity can create frustration and despair.’\\" Many of the controversies may never be solved. Evans was of a time where \\"patient's secrets went to the grave with them\\". Evans was unwell in his later years, requiring major abdominal surgery in 1962. Never fully recovering, he died in 1963 at the age of 60 years.

Causes The causes of teratozoospermia are unknown in most cases. However, Hodgkin's disease, coeliac disease, and Crohn's disease may contribute in some instances.http://www.gfmer.ch/Endo/Lectures_09/dupan1.htm Lifestyle and habits (smoking, toxin exposure, etc.) can also cause poor morphology. Varicocele is another condition that is often associated with decreased normal forms (morphology). In cases of globozoospermia (sperm with round heads), the Golgi apparatus is not transformed into the acrosome that is needed for fertilization.Page 155 in: Symptoms and treatment The presence of abnormally-shaped sperm can negatively affect fertility by preventing transport through the cervix and/or preventing sperm from adhering to the ovum. Achieving a pregnancy may be difficult.http://www.gfmer.ch/Endo/Lectures_09/dupan.htm In testing for teratozoospermia, sperm are collected, stained and analyzed under a microscope to detect abnormalities. These abnormalities may include heads that are large, small, tapered, or pyriform or tails that are abnormally shaped. Antiestrogens have been shown to be effective in the treatment of teratozoospermia. Teratozoospermia (including the globozoospermia type), may be treated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), injecting sperm directly into the egg. Once the egg is fertilized, abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence blastocyst development or blastocyst morphology. Even with severe teratozoospermia, microscopy can still detect the few sperm cells that have a \\"normal\\" morphology, allowing for optimal success rate.

Pepys was not only disappointed with the language and design of the play; a lover of music like himself also disapproved of the musical setting. The play was performed again on 20 May 1668, following on another probable performance the previous day.The London Stage 1660-1800 Ed. William Van Lennep, Vol. I, 137. See also PEPYS, IX, 206. The Mulberry-Garden was still performed on 29 June 1668. While the play was not a smash hit, it had the average reception of so many other comedies at the time. The new edition of The Mulberry-Garden (1675) suggests that the play was revived for the theatre season of 1674/75.LONDON STAGE, I, 221. As far as is known, The Mulberry-Garden was not revived after Sedley's death (1701). Unlike the well-known comedies The Country Wife, The Man of Mode and Ravenscroft's London Cuckolds, Sedley's play never belonged to a canon of plays which were regularly performed in the eighteenth century. The Structure of The Mulberry-Garden The Mulberry- Garden is a typical split-plot tragicomedy, which was a popular and thriving genre of Restoration comedy between 1660 and 1671.For a modern edition of Sedley's comedies, see Sir Charles Sedley's \\"The Mulberry-Garden\\" (1668) and \\"Bellamira: or, The Mistress\\" (1687) Ed. Holger Hanowell (Frankfurt a.M., 2001). The present article is an excerpt from Hanowell's edition, authorized by the editor. See also Robert D. Hume, The Development of English Drama in the Late Seventeenth Century (Oxford, 1976). The multi-plot structure generally comprises a heroic couple (e.g. Althea and Eugenio, Diana and Philander in Sedley's play) in a high plot with a chivalric or aristocratic code of impeccable moral integrity, whose discourse is usually presented in (rhyming) couplets. Therefore heroic high plots in tragicomedies share with heroic drama in general the basic conception to instruct the spectator and to raise in him an admiration for the heroic characters (see Lisideus's definition of drama in John Dryden's Essay of Dramatick Poesie).The Works of John Dryden Eds Edward Niles Hooker and H.T. Swedenberg, Jr, Vol. XVII, 15 and 35. A satiric middle plot introduces a witty \\"gay couple\\"John Harrington Smith, The Gay Couple in Restoration Comedy (Cambridge, MA, 1948). (Olivia and Wildish, a polite rake) that manages to live the free spirit of self- determination, although their love is frequently threatened by blocking characters (Olivia's uncle, the Puritan Sir Samuel Forecast).For a description of the multiple-plot structure, see J. Douglas Canfield, \\"Ideology of Restoration Tragicomedy\\", in: ELH, 51, (1984), 447-64. On the third level, the gulling plot, certain stereotypical characters, such as the sanctimonious Puritan (Sir Samuel), the modish gallant (Estridge and Modish), or the lecherous old ogler, are satirized. Examples of this type of play are James Howard's The English Mounsieur (1663/1674), George Etherege's Comical Revenge: or, Love in a Tub (1664), John Dryden's An Evening's Love: or, The Mock Astrologer (1667), and William Wycherley's Love in a Wood (1671). Although tragicomedies generally do not feature heroic characters in epic-like situations, they uphold class distinctions, social hierarchies, and aristocratic values in the high plots. In The Mulberry-Garden, Sedley created a heroic high plot in which the two couples are facing a sea of troubles hindering their love, and the marriages of Althea and Eugenio and Diana and Philander are finally brought about only by the device of deus ex machina. The lovers are characterized by distinctive sets of values that determine their behaviour within a frame of idealized romance. The male heroic characters follow a code of honour in the traditional vein of chivalry, and the female equivalents stand for virtue and moral integrity. As in the code of romances, the attitude towards love remains both idealistic and asexual throughout the play; the heroic lovers are never in danger of sexual promiscuity or of other forces that imperil their virtue. It is through the female heroine of the middle plot, Olivia, that the rhyming confessions of her sister Victoria are presented as pompous. The gay couple of the middle plot offers an ideal of marriage which is based upon independence and the pursuit of one's personal happiness. Whatever standards the heroic couples (re)present, it is the marriage of Olivia and Wildish that is central to the play. Therefore, the middle plot presents a golden mean between two extremes. Although The Mulberry-Garden is not anti-heroic, the validity of older, stricter conventions of patriarchal authority and unreflecting obedience are called into question. The original Mulberry garden was a tree-planted pleasure ground and occupied the site of the present Buckingham Palace and gardens. Its name derives from a garden of mulberry trees planted in the reign of James I. in 1609.Walter Besant, London in the Time of the Stuarts.

It was the source for a major eruption about 3840 years ago that produced a pyroclastic flow that filled valleys south and west of the volcano's crater and reached the sea at Canoe Bay.  Geography and geology  Dana is northeast of the Canoe Bay inlet, as it sits at the top of Pavlof Bay. It is from Anchorage. The United States has the most active volcanoes in the world, many of them geologically young. In Alaska, at least 50 volcanoes, including those in the Aleutian archipelago, have erupted in historical time. The state accounts for ~80% of the United States' volcanoes, excluding the seamounts in the area, ~8% of world volcanoes, and most of these are located among the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands arc serves as the northern boundary of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic activity generates earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in masses. Made up of intermediate composition calc-alkaline rocks, the volcano hosts remnants of an andesite-based dome, just off the western side of the crater and east of Knutson Lake. It resides on submarine sandstone and shale, timed at the Jurassic and Cretaceous eras.Kienle and Wood, p. 54. Rising , the volcano is topped by a crater 1.5 kilometers in height by 2 kilometers in width. To the southwest of the caldera, an exposed sector reveals a layer of sedimentary Mesozoic era stone.

Anatomy  The fish is stout and deep-bodied, with a pointed snout and long continuous dorsal fin. It is brown with tan wavy bands stretching the length of its body. On the dorsal fin near the head is a small blue spot. This species grows to TL. The fish has relatively large fangs (canine teeth) that protrude from the lower jaw.  Venom  The unusual venom, which targets the body's opioid receptors, is being investigated as a potential new painkiller for human use. The venom consists of a neuropeptide also seen in cone snail venom, a lipase similar to the one used by certain species of scorpions and an opioid peptide. Blennies use it to stun predators. The venom reduces the blood pressure of the predator, relaxing its jaws so the blenny can escape. Administration of the venom was found to not cause pain in mice, which is atypical, as most fish venoms are painful. Administration of the venom also did not result in a drop in heart rate in rats.

Mayaya is particularly noted for his role as the Chairperson of the National Right to Food Network, a loose coalition of about 25 Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) working in the area of Civil and Political Rights.Khunga, Suzgo. \\"Malawi Rated Poorly on Social Protection.\\" The Daily Times. The Times Group Publication, 18 Sept. 2010. Web. 30 Oct. 2010. . The coalition is designed to promote Economic, Social and Cultural Rights with a specific focus on the Human right to food in Malawi. Of particular significance has been the development of a draft Right to Food Bill, with advocacy focused on targeting the Malawi National Assembly, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Malawi Law Commission and the Malawi Human Rights Commission. Early life and education Billy Mayaya was born to Abner Lemon Mayaya (August 15, 1932) a former career diplomat and Mirriam Chiwambo (died November 2007 aged 74 years). His father worked for more than 32 years for the government of Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Because of his father's diplomat job, Mayaya attended the Sandford English Community School in Addis Ababa, Langley High School in Langley Oaks, Virginia and Saint Andrews International High School in Blantyre, Malawi. He enrolled for undergraduate studies at the TransAfrica Theological College in Kitwe, Zambia, a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Malawi Chancellor College, received a Master of Science in Strategic Management from the University of Derby, as well as a Master of Business Administration from the University of Malawi, the Polytechnic. He is currently enrolled as a PhD Student at the Mzuzu University in Northern Malawi. Controversy He began work as a teacher in Malawian private secondary schools teaching English, French and History. He came to prominence when he was recruited as a Programme Facilitator for Church and Society, the Human Rights and Advocacy department of the Church of Central African Presbyterian, the second largest denomination in Malawi after the Catholic Church. In 2002, together with a colleague Robson Chitengo, he called for the impeachment of the then State President of Malawi, Bakili Muluzi after rumors that he was planning for an unconstitutional third term. In 2004, after the election of Muluzi's handpicked successor, Bingu wa Mutharika, a press statement was released by Church and Society signed by Mayaya and Chitengo calling for the impeachment of the newly elected President after it emerged unofficially that Mutharika was planning to dump the party that endorsed as its candidate and form his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party with backing from Taiwan. Church officials were displeased with the press release and publicly disassociated themselves from it. Mayaya and Chitengo were summoned to a disciplinary hearing with threats that their jobs were on the line. Mayaya publicly apologised for the blunder, whereas Chitengo resigned with intentions to run as a Parliamentary candidate in by-elections. In 2011, he was the official spokesperson of the July 20 Demonstrations against the government of former President Bingu wa Mutharika. The same year, he organised a demonstration against the presence of Sudanese dicator Omar al Bashir during the COMESA summit. He was subsequently arrested and charged with sedition together with lawyer Habiba Osman, Ben Chiza Mkandawire, Brian Nyasulu and Comfort Chitseko. They spent six days in custody. The case was eventually discharged in 2011. Through their lawyers, Wapona Kita and Ralph Kasambara the group sued government for compensation. The government compensated the group in 2014 Organising Demonstrations As an activist, he is renowned for organising demonstrations. In 2014, he led a protest against Xenophobic attacks on Malawians in South Africa. A petition was delivered to the South African High Commissioner in Lilongwe. In the same year he organised another protest against the sale of the Malawi Savings Bank.

The band includes quotation marks in their name to differentiate themselves from other bands with a similar name. Their music has been described as \\"punk 'n' roll\\", but the band claims it should only be described as high-energy rock. Their musical style relies heavily on the energy derived from punk rock. Influences include 1960s garage rock bands such as The Sonics, The Standells and Shadows of Knight, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and New York Dolls; and punk rock bands such as The Damned, The Heartbreakers and The Saints; and early hardcore punk bands such as Black Flag, Bad Brains and Dead Kennedys. \\"Demons\\" has often been compared to contemporary groups like New Bomb Turks, The Hellacopters and Electric Frankenstein. The band established themselves in the mid-1990s Swedish punk/garage rock scene with releases such as Electrocute and \\"Demons\\"... Come Bursting Out!. \\"Demons\\" initially gained more popularity in the United States than in their homeland, and thus much of their music has been released on American record labels, most notably Gearhead Records based in Oakland, California. They have completed several US and European tours, including two appearances at SXSW. The Hellacopters recorded a cover version of Electrocute for their final album Head Off in 2008. During \\"Demons\\" existence other groups unfortunately have used the same name. Actions have been taken to prevent the issue. Band history In the late 1980s, Mathias Carlsson and Stefan Jonsson, both just thirteen years old at the time, formed the band Jawbation with school friends. Drummer Mikael Jacobsson joined later. Jawbation slowly disintegrated and morphed into a new band in 1994, which they named \\"Demons\\" on the advice of Lux Interior and Poison Ivy from The Cramps. A session was recorded in 1995 which was supposed to be the band's debut album. It was never released but used as a promotion cassette called Strings for Hanging and Twanging. In the mid-to-late-1990s, \\"Demons\\" tracks appeared on many compilation releases such as Another Real Cool Time – Distorted Sounds from the North and released their debut single \\"Electrocute\\" on Ruff Nite Records. Their six-track EP \\"Demons\\"... Come Bursting Out! was released in 1998. The album was recorded in Sunlight Studio with Tomas Skogsberg (known for his work with The Hellacopters as well as several notable Swedish death metal bands such as Entombed). The band signed with Gearhead Records in 1999, and released their debut album Riot Salvation in 2000. After the release of \\"Scarcity Rock\\" and its following tour in 2011 the band took a break. They resurfaced for a show in 2015 and recordings followed. In 2016 the Electrocute single was reissued for Record Store Day. In March 2017 the brand new single \\"Kids are Gonna Cry\\" was released by Alaska Productions. It had a strong anti fascist message. The next single was a split with UK's The Hip Priests, a collaboration with Savage Magic Records and Cracking Stuff Records. It was released in March 2018. After that \\"Demons\\" put out ...Was Here on Ghost Highway Recordings. The band also appear on the festivals Drenched in Beer and Gutter Island Garage Rock Festival. Several more records was released in 2018 as well as appearances with material in films, on soundtracks, compilations and split singles. April 30th 2019 the band's first full length in nine years, Kiss Off was released. It was highly anticipated and got great reviews. In January 2020 \\"DEMONS\\" did a short tour of Japan to prepare for what was going to be their 25th anniversary as a band. When the pandemic hit their whole anniversary tour was cancelled and no shows were played. Even so the band decided to release a couple of archival albums starting with No Loitering! - Burn Down the Club recorded in 2004 at the legendary Crocodile Cafe in Seattle.

They were part of a package including The Nomads and The Fleshtones. The Nomads resigned from the tour following the September 11 attacks on World Trade Center. In March 2002, the band went on their second US tour. They began recording their follow up album Stockholm Slump with Tomas Skogsberg shortly after the tour ended. Before the album was mixed, \\"Demons\\" headed out to play the Scandinavian Gearfests (music festival coordinated by Gearhead Records) held in Stockholm, Helsinki and Oslo. After the album's release, they embarked on another coast-to-coast US tour, with the New Bomb Turks. \\"Demons\\" performed extensively throughout Europe in 2003. They toured the US again in 2004 after the release of Demonology – If You Can´t Join Us Beat Us, a collection of tracks from compilations and other rare recordings. In 2006, the band toured Scandinavia, Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. Following the release of the critically acclaimed album \\"Ace In The Hole\\", the band joined The Hellacopters for twelve shows on their farewell tour \\"The Tour Before The Fall. Some shows also included New Zealand band The Datsuns. The Hellacopters also covered the \\"Demons\\" song \\"Electrocute\\" on the album \\"Head Off\\". \\"Demons\\" continued to promote \\"Ace In The Hole\\" on tours in Sweden and Italy throughout 2009. A single \\"My Bleeding Heart\\" was lifted off the album for release and came out on the Italian label Tornado Ride. At the end of 2010 \\"Demons\\" released the album \\"Scarcity Rock\\" which was more experimental than earlier releases. The band recorded most of it themselves on a portable studio in their rehearsal space. It was self-released on red vinyl with a free cd inside. Tours in Italy and Germany followed. After this the band took a four- year break and resurfaced with a show, the reissue of Electrocute and the new singles \\"Kids are Gonna Cry\\", \\"DEMONS\\"/The Hip Priests\\" and \\"... Was Here\\" as well as a collaboration album, \\"On the Streets and In Our Hearts\\" with punk rock legend Jeff Dahl. In April 2019 the band released the full length album \\"Kiss Off\\" on Glunk Records and Alaska Productions. The album was greatly received and voted one of the best album of 2019 by several publications. The magazine Classic Rock gave the album eight out of ten and called it \\"a veritable orgy of hard core rock'n'roll\\". In January 2020 the band went back to Japan for a short tour. They announced their 25th anniversary starting with a couple of archival releases including a live album called \\"No Loitering\\" recorded at the legendary Crocodile Cafe in Seattle.

Carlsson has also worked with Belinda Kordic (formerly with STABB), on her solo project, Killing Mood. On her debut album \\"Just Another Love Song\\" he contributed with guitar, slide guitar, harmonica and arrangements on several tracks. =The Crypt Kicker Five= In 1995, Carlsson formed the acoustic group The Crypt Kicker Five (also called The Crypt Kicker 5 and CK5) with Odd Ahlgren from The Robots and Vejde Gustavsson from Mazarine Street. Inspired by street music, primitive folk music, rhythm and blues and artists such as Dr John, they used a one-string acoustic guitar and homemade instruments to achieve a sound that mixed blues, gospel and country-inspired acoustic punk. Later additions to the group were Joakim Ericson from The Nomads, Anders Graham Paulsson formerly with Atomic Swing, and Gustav Bendt from Monster and Moneybrother on saxophone. As a six-piece, they have released two singles, and evolved a unique style, with Ahlgren as a confrontational front man and the band performing their street corner brand of voodoo blues. =Matching Numbers= In the late 1990s, Carlsson formed the garage band Matching Numbers with Ahlgren, Ericson, and Björn Grunner. In 1998, they recorded a version of Suzi Quatro's \\"Daytona Demon\\" for the compilation Swedish Sins '99, released by White Jazz Records. The band later included Paulsson on bass. Matching Numbers appeared on the compilation Riot On The Rocks Vol 2 released by Safety Pin Records, and released a split single with The Immortal Lee County Killers before disbanding in the early 2000s (decade).

Redlip blennies can be found in coral crests and shallow fringing reefs. They are highly territorial and attack intruders with two long, sharp canine teeth. The adults are found at depths of 10 to 20 meters, and the eggs are benthic. The adults may reach up to four inches in length when fully grown, and they have large reddish lips, from which they attained their names. Redlip blennies largely feed on algae. Taxonomy The species was originally described by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes in 1836. Ophis is Greek for \\"serpent\\", and blennios is Greek for \\"mucus.\\" The species name atlanticus is the name for its location of capture. The common name, redlip, refers to the reddish color of its lips. Description Adult redlip blennies can reach two to four inches in length. They are chocolate brown in appearance with some yellow markings, and possess blunt heads featuring four branching horns, and large reddish lips. A variation on the species is a paler form, having a shell-white body and reddish brown head. Distribution and habitat Ophioblennius atlanticus is native to the tropical marine environments of the central Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends to the eastern Atlantic from Senegal to Angola, including offshore islands, in the northeastern Atlanticit is confined to the Macaronesian archipelagos of the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. In the western Atlantic it is found off Bermuda and off the shores of North Carolina south through the West Indies to Brazil. Ophioblennius atlanticus mostly inhabits shallow, clear waters with coral reefs and rock bottoms. Ophioblennius atlanticus adults are mostly found at depths of 10 to 20 meters, while their eggs are benthic. Aquaculture These fish occasionally make their way into the pet trade. They require a minimum of 30 gallons, and being generally peaceful are suitable for community tanks, as long as no other fish have a similar body shape. However they do well in mated pairs. They should be kept at temperatures of , with a PH level of 8.1–8.4. They have a jumping ability which allows them to jump from tide pool to tide pool in the wild. This means that if they are to be housed in an aquarium a lid is necessary. The horseface blenny feeds primarily on algae, but also consumes zooplankton and other invertebrates. They possess two razor-sharp canine teeth, which has earned them the nickname of \\"devil fish\\" in some countries.http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=15+2730+1427&pcatid;=1427 Behavior =Reproduction= Redlip blennies reproduce year-round in the ten days before and four days after the full moon in each month. The male and female pair up in the first three hours of daylight, and the female moves to the male territory. The male has to prepare a nest for depositing eggs. In order to prepare a nest, the male makes a \\"small box-like\\" space in its territory and removes coral rubble and dead algae crusts from the space. One male redlip blenny usually has five nests, and the amount of time he spends at each nest is determined by how much the nest is favored by females. Usually the most favored nest has a larger inner surface area and volume than the less favored ones. When a female redlip blenny enters a male's nest, the female chooses whether or not to mate with the male. Larger males with larger nests have better chance of successful mating than smaller males with smaller nests. During spawning seasons, males reduce their feeding. The eggs are deposited in a single layer, and the male guards and cares for the eggs by blowing air onto them until they hatch as planktonic larvae. The egg batches in one nest may be at different developmental stages because the male redlip blenny is polygynous, mating with multiple females. In other words, the eggs have different mothers. Female redlip blennies tend to be polyandrous as well, meaning that there are multiple nests with one female's eggs. The female mate choice primarily relies on a male's genetic quality or its non-genetic quality. A male is recognized to have good genes, if it has physical features that are suitable for survival. Usually, big body size indicates good genetic quality. Mating with a male of good genetic quality assures that the offspring will also have good genes and thus the physical features favorable for survival. This eventually will propagate the female's own genes. The non- genetic quality includes many examples, such as good parental care. Good parental care does not guarantee good genes for the offspring. However, good parental care can increase the survival rate of the offspring, thereby spreading the female's genes. Female redlip blennies consider both the genetic and non-genetic quality of the male. First of all, they choose males largely based on their sizes (genetic quality). Larger males can better protect the female and the eggs against predators. Furthermore, larger male redlip blennies have larger antimicrobial organs at their anal-urogenital regions, which they use to prevent microbial infection in the eggs. Female redlip blennies also consider males' allopaternal care when choosing mates (non- genetic quality). Allopaternal care proves to the female that the male is capable of protecting the eggs from predators. Finally, a statistical study showed that female redlip blennies may prefer older males because the age of the male could reflect his survival ability and thus guarantee the offspring better fitness (chance of survival). =Parental care= Most parental care in fish is paternal care, where the male primarily gives care to the eggs, and redlip blennies are not exception. A male redlip blenny exhibits typical paternal care behaviors, such as protecting the eggs from predators and blowing fresh air to the eggs. The male also performs a non-typical paternal care: rubbing its anal-urogenital region over the nest's internal surface during spawning. The male redlip blenny has an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. This organ only exists in males due to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, by rubbing the anal-urogenital region over the nest's internal surface, the male protects its eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes for mortality in young fish. Larger males have larger organs at their anal-urogenital regions and thus can provide better antimicrobial protection for the eggs than smaller males. Consequently, female redlip blennies choose their mates based on their size. Another atypical paternal care in redlip blennies is that the male indiscriminately cares for its own eggs and foreign eggs. When a male takes over the deserted nest, he will guard and care for the existing eggs in the nest, even though they are not his own eggs. This is called allopaternal care. Allopaternal care seems to be a huge disadvantage from an evolutionary perspective, since the male expends its resources to benefit genetically unrelated offspring. However, exhibiting allopaternal care actually attracts more females because the existence of safe eggs in the nest proves the male's capacity to protect the eggs against predators. The allopaternal behavior also shows to female that the male is a trustworthy mate who will remain after mating and provide the eggs with a good amount of parental investment, thereby increasing the fitness of the offspring. =Territoriality= Territorial behavior is usually performed to defend resources such as food, shelter, possible mates, spawning sites, and offspring. Redlip blennies live among rocks and coral reefs, and they are benthic. A redlip blenny generally exhibits aggressive territorial behaviors towards other benthic fishes, as they may take over its shelter and spawning site. Its territorial behavior is most severe towards conspecifics. This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources, leading to the most severe resource competition. A redlip blenny shows hostility of varying degrees not only to intruding conspecifics but also to barely intruding conspecifics. Due to this severe territoriality, the redlip blennies that have lost their territories experience a great difficulty in finding a new territory. Empty territories are often shared by neighboring fish without much competition. Despite severe territoriality, during the periods of lower adult blenny density, many blennies gather up and fight against old residents to take over their territories. After such aggressive competition, each old resident usually ends up with only half of its previous territory. =Larval swimming= Many fish have a swimbladder. By filling the swimbladder with gas, fish can float and swim in the water. However, redlip blennies never develop a swimbladder. The lack of a swimbladder does not affect adult redlip blennies, since they have already adjusted to the benthic life, as they matured. However, unlike the adults, redlip blenny larvae are not comfortable living at the sea bottom. Until they adjust to the bottom- dwelling life style, the larvae use a means of floating for survival: redlip blenny larvae have a huge storage of lipids in their liver, and this high lipid concentration provides buoyancy. The larvae keeps its high lipid concentration until maturation. Later, as the larvae go through metamorphosis, it burns down all the stored lipids to support the high metabolism of metamorphosis. After losing its lipids through metamorphosis, the now-grown-up redlip blenny does not restore lipids, which provides a permanent high density body to the adult fish. References * DeLoach, N.

The deity can be represented as either male or female, but is most frequently identified as the female Húxiān Niángniáng ( \\"Fox Immortal Lady\\") whose animal form is a nine- tailed fox. She is the Chinese equivalent of the Japanese Shintō cult of Inari Ōkami, both god(desses) of the foxes or collective representations of the fox sprites. Mythology tells that fox sprites are masters of the arts of metamorphosis, and can manifest in human form to seduce men or women. In exchange, they convey wealth and property. In mystical literature, influenced by Taoism, fox spirits are immortal or transcendent beings of a high level in the spiritual hierarchy or beings who engage in the pursuit of becoming immortals. The fox deity is also represented as a couple of gods, male and female, called the Great Lord of the Three Foxes ( Húsān Tàiyé) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes ( Húsān Tàinǎi). As a goddess, the Fox Immortal is related to Xīwángmǔ ( \\"Queen Mother of the West\\"), the great goddess guardian of Mount Kunlun (axis mundi). pp. 88-89, 184. Prevalence of the sect in northeast China Nagao Ryuzō, a Japanese sinologist, observed that the Fox Gods \\"enjoy such popularity to be worshipped by almost every household in north China and Manchuria\\". Henry Doré documented the worship of the Fox God in the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui. In parts of Hebei, to every newborn is assigned his own běnshén ( patron god) manifestation of Huxian, usually a female for a boy and a male for a girl. After these boys and girls get married, their patrons will be represented sitting together. In his survey of popular shrines and temples in Manchuria, Takizawa Shunryō found the number dedicated to Fox Gods overwhelming.

Israel claimed that the UFOs were also seen by a nearby barangay, and possibly residents of Parañaque City.\\"Farshores UFO Dimensions: Incident At Las Piñas\\" . Retrieved November 18, 2008.  2004 Las Piñas UFO incident  More than 10 UFOs were seen in Las Piñas at around 7 p.m. Saturday, August 28, 2004. Three children noticed two unusual reddish-etheric glares moving above some partly cloudy skies from their residence in Mabolo St., Verdant Acres, Pamplona, Las Piñas City. The first object they saw headed east to where the moon sits around that time. Another two emerged and three more objects appeared from the western horizon. \\"These unusual objects could not be mere airplanes because two of them were already pretty close to the moon,\\" exclaimed 11-year-old Nica Canarias as she apparently had the impression that the objects were heading to the moon. Nica, the eldest in the Canarias siblings and one of the early witnesses, immediately called her nine-year-old friend Adrian Israel. Adrian - whom the Canarias knew as a UFO experiencer is the son of Antonio (Tony) Israel, who took video footage of UFOs above the Las Piñas skies back on September 3, 2000. Adrian confirmed that these objects were similar to those he saw four years ago. So he rushed back to his house and prompted his older brothers, who then told their father Tony. Tony rushed outside with his video camera. He was joined by his neighbors who watched while the objects moved erratically, jerking, floating and jumping in various directions. From 7:30 to 8:15pm, Israel was shooting videos of at least five UFOs - each emerging from the horizon at time intervals of approximately eight minutes. Israel told ABS- CBN that he was now more composed in aiming his video camera at the subjects compared to his first encounter. He added, \\"I learned a big lesson from the previous investigations made by the PAGASA UFO Investigating Team (Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration) and from criticisms telling that in my first UFO encounter, the video lacked panning that’s why there was no referential point to approximate size and distance. So from this chance, I think I panned well-enough and a probable estimation of the objects' altitude and size could be established.\\"TV PATROL-ABS-CBN News (August 30, 2004)  2011 Bulacan UFO incident A couple of UFOs were seen in Bulacan in the first week of May. But they disappeared and were never seen. On May 27, people caught a sight of two UFOs in the middle of the night. Same as the September 2000 UFO sightings, it was red and large like a basketball. Some people said that one of them was at the east and the other at the west, colliding with each other and then disappeared. Cavite sightings There were UFO sightings in Cavite in 2011. Another sighting occurred on May 16, 2018. Witness said he saw two luminous light which came from a distant star. It looked like it left the star and followed what seems like a diagonal route according to the witness. Unfortunately, no other person saw the phenomena thus, no one can confirm what the witness said.  Alleged \\"UFO\\" sighted in Pampanga  The alleged \\"UFO\\" was sighted on evening of April 26, 2015 was quickly circulated across the Facebook. The video shows the motionless lights was apparently floating in the sky. According to the person who took the video, while they in Lubao-Pampanga diversion road, they notice that the lights later formed a letter \\"V\\". At first, they only saw three lights until the lights are appeared seven more. Later, the lights vanishes a little bit. The next morning, they returned to the area where the lights appeared in the sky; there is no buildings situated in this area. The video was shown by PAGASA, according to them, they estimate about 800–1000 meters high from the ground. Also, PAGASA states that is impossible that the lights coming from the airplane, hot air balloon, or drones due to its size of the lights. The lights appeared in 5–8 minutes based on the concept of eyewitnesses.\\"UFO\\" sighted in Pampanga uploaded on April 29, 2015  Suspected UFO sightings in Negros Occidental  In the night of February 2019, a mysterious light was sighted every night in Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, where the residents suspected that it was an UFO. When it is captured by the professional camera, it shows the object in bright yellow and it moves to the right while the light fades out. The mysterious light which captured on the camera appeared on the top of the Crocodile Island. At 10:30pm, the light reappeared. The residents cannot explain what object it was. On February 14, the light appeared again, this time the object is stationary and suddenly disappears on the camera lens. On February 15, the local residents have been waited for the light to reappear but it is fruitless due to cloudy skies. Investigating the pictures of the light, PAGASA Astronomical Publication Unit Chief Jose Mendoza IV said that these lights are neither airplane nor the star. He added that the object could be the satellite of the International Space Station – which was launched into orbit in 1998. Though the PAGASA confirmed that the object is the satellite, the object they saw is the planet Mars. However, when asked Mendoza of moving lights, it is possible that it was the airplane.

Background He was born in Sussex, a son of Trayton Young. In 1908 he married Emily Phoebe Terry of Portslade. The Liberal Year Book 1935 She died in 1919 aged 39. He was a lecturer, writer and journalist by profession.The Times House of Commons, 1931; Politico’s Publishing 2003, p48 Political career Young ran unsuccessfully for Parliament as the Liberal candidate at Jarrow in 1922 Craig, op cit p345 and at Rossendale in 1923 and 1924.Craig op cit p228 He also ran at a by-election in the Scottish constituency of Bothwell in Lanarkshire in March 1926,The Times, 18 March 1926 and in Middlesbrough East in 1929. In 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald which was initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. Young was elected as Liberal MP for Middlesbrough East at the 1931 general election as a supporter of the government and a member of the official Liberal party led by Sir Herbert Samuel, defeating the well-known local Labour MP, Ellen Wilkinson in a straight fight. Samuel and the Liberals, although agreeing to go into the 1931 general election supporting the government became increasingly concerned about the government's abandonment of the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition, soon withdrew from the National Government. Some Liberals, led by Sir John Simon remained in the government and became known as the Liberal Nationals. Young refused to join this group and stuck with the Samuelite Liberals. At the 1935 general election therefore, the coalition mantle had passed from Young to the Conservative candidate, Mr. B Chetwynd- Talbot. In an election where the main fight was between the National Government and a revived Labour Party, Young lost his seat to Labour candidate Alfred Edwards who narrowly beat off the National challenge. Young finished a poor third place in a three-cornered contest. Young remained active in the Liberal Party, and was their election agent in Worthing in the 1945 general election.Worthing Herald, 8 June 1945 He died in Hove in 1953.

It is neither a blenny nor a goby, but is in fact one of two species in the family Pholidichthyidae. Description A small eel-shaped fish, it can grow up to in length. Juveniles resemble the striped catfish Plotosus lineatus, which is venomous, having a black body with a white dorsal stripe. As they develop, the stripe changes to white convict-style barring or spotting in the adult. Ecology Two P. leucotaenia P. leucotaenia lives in shallow lagoons and on coastal reefs from the Philippines to the Solomon Islands. It is often found in schools under ledges or around coral heads. These schools swim in such tight formations, they resemble a single organism. Occasionally, the species is found in the aquarium trade, where it is known for disrupting all but the most stable structures. DNA analyses show this species to be neither a blenny nor a goby, but part of a separate fish family, the Pholidichthyidae. In the Solomon Islands, researchers under Eugenie Clark found juveniles emerging from holes in the seafloor and adjoining coral reefs. By day, these juveniles swim up to from their home burrows to feed on plankton. At the end of the day, all returned to the burrows, remarkable and unique behaviour for larval fish. While their young are out feeding, the parents eject mouthfuls of debris from the burrows. In a single day as much as 3 kg (6.6 lb) of sand might be collected and spat out of the hole by the parents.Life by BBC, 2009, pg 64, Research has revealed a maze of tunnels and chambers totaling a length of some 6 m. At night, young fish dangle by their mouths from the roof of the tunnels by thin mucous threads. Adults may grow to almost , but never leave the tunnels to feed. They frequently take in mouthfuls of juveniles and spit them out again. An inspection of adult stomachs showed only a green slime.

A Blaan girl. A Blaan offering tribe dance during colorful street dancing competition on the T'nalak Festival in South Cotabato. Classification The Blaan are neighbors of the Tboli, and live in Lake Sebu and Tboli municipalities of South Cotabato, Sarangani, General Santos City, the southeastern part of Davao and around Lake Buluan in North Cotabato. They are famous for their brassworks, beadwork, and tabih weave. The people of these tribes wear colorful embroidered native costumes and beadwork accessories. The women of these tribes, particularly, wear heavy brass belts with brass \\"tassels\\" ending in tiny brass bells that herald their approach even when they are a long way off. History Some Blaan natives were displaced when General Santos City was founded in 1939. Others settled in the city. Their language is said to be the source of the name for Koronadal City, from two Blaan words – kalon meaning cogon grass and nadal or datal meaning plain, which aptly described the place for the natives. On the other hand, Marbel, which is another name for the poblacion, is a Blaan term malb-el which means \\"murky waters\\" referring to a river, now called Marbel River.

For example, \\"PC brigade\\" is used to describe a supposed group of people who go around enforcing political correctness rules. \\"Green welly brigade\\" refers in a deprecating way to well-heeled people who find their recreation in the countryside.

The term 'Nothing to hide, nothing to fear brigade' is used in regards to people who support increased state surveillance - particularly in the UK - with the justification that only people who are willingly committing crimes would need to worry about being under scrutiny. The opposing side is often called the 'Orwell brigade', the '1984 brigade', or the 'conspiracy brigade'.

Early life John Plumptre Carr Glyn was born Witchampton, east Dorset.1901 Census of England Military career He joined the Rifle Brigade in August 1854 just before the opening of hostilities in the Crimea. He saw active service during the second year of the campaign and was present at Sebastopol from 17 June until the fall of the fortress on 11 September 1855. He was promoted from ensign to lieutenant without purchase on 29 December 1854.Bulletins and Other State Intelligence He next saw active service, in 1874, as a major in the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, under Colonel Sir Garnet Wolseley during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. He was personally involved in the Battle of Amoaful on 31 January 1874 and five days later when the fighting ended with the Battle of Ordashu. He was also present at the capture of the capital, Kumasi, which had been abandoned by the Ashanti.Army Navy Air Force website The Ashanti War gave him his brevet of lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1874. The only mention, found to date, of his involvement in the Anglo-Zulu Wars is the following: Lt-Col Bengough arrived in Natal with the 77th Foot in December 1878. He was placed in command of the 2nd Battalion Natal Native Contingent, which formed part of Durnford's Column,Brevet Colonel Anthony W. Durnford, Royal Engineers and which was left to protect the frontier at Kranz Kop on the departure of that force to join Glyn's Column. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1879. On 16 December 1884, while on half pay, he was gazetted to be Lieutenant-Colonel, to command the 22nd Regimental District (the Cheshire Regiment). In 1892 he succeeded Sir Evelyn Wood as the General Officer Commanding the Eastern District at home and held the post until 1896. He was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1889 and to lieutenant-general in January 1898. The 1901 Census of England indicates that he had retired and was living in the parish of Holt, Dorset. He was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) on 18 January 1903. The Ashanti Ring The Ashanti Ring, also known as the Wolseley ring, was a group of 19th century British army officers loyal to Garnet Wolseley and considered by him to be clever, brave, experienced and hard-working. The 'ring' itself was rooted in Wolseley's appointments for the Ashanti Campaign of 1873–4, in which Wolseley led British troops to take control of the Gold Coast. After the Crimean War Wolseley started to keep a note of the best officers he met, and began gathering a network of able military men loyal to him. There were other circles around other military leaders; later these would dwindle as more formal selection and promotion procedures became established. Men from this group accompanied Wolseley on his various projects for about a decade. They are sometimes called the Ashanti Ring, or, in a punning reference to Wolseley's first name, the Garnet Ring. Later they were the Africans against the Indians of the rival Roberts Ring of Lord Roberts and Herbert Kitchener during the Boer War. Family life Glyn's father was Rev. Carr John Glyn (1799–1897), who was a godfather and namesake to Handley Carr Glyn Moule, a theologian and bishop of Durham.

After its acknowledgment as a separate breed, it enjoyed a short time of popularity among cat breeders in the United States. By now, due to crossbreeding with other Rex types, this breed seems to have merged with the other more popular Rex breeds like the Cornish Rex and the Devon Rex. History The first documented case of an Oregon Rex cat is traced back to a litter of cats in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1955. The specific kitten differed from its siblings and its mother by having a curly coat, whereas the others all had straight fur. At the same time, the first Cornish Rex were imported to the U.S. from Great Britain, and were soon interbred with the developing Oregon Rex breed. Breeders from Oregon then established a purebred Oregon Rex, which soon became one of America's most popular Rex breeds. In the course of breeding, however, all types of Rex cats—each of which differ genetically—were crossbred, and the Oregon Rex did not endure as a stand-alone breed. Appearance The typical curly coat was silky, short and tight, and featured no or only relatively short guard hair. The kemp was shorter than the German Rex's or Cornish Rex's and was fully developed, with a typical subapical swelling. Their minimal flexion made the kemp hairs longer than the undercoat. The number of hairs was normal, but the bristles were missing. The head was wedge-shaped with a long bridge. The ears were large with smoothly rounded edges and were set high on the head, and the eyes were medium-sized with an oval shape. The Oregon Rex's body was of an elongated and tiny build, the tail was long, slim and peaked. The legs were long, gracile and slim, with tiny, round paws. Character The Oregon Rex combined the character traits of all Rex breeds. They were affectionate and needy, funny and playful, sometimes a little turbulent, and a little arrogant. The Oregon Rex was also reported to have a dominant character and thus to be somewhat complicated to handle. Genetics The origin of the Oregon Rex breed is a result of mutation. Mutations of the gene responsible for the typical curly hair or those genes involved in that process seem to be quite common. In addition to the other Rex breeds there are several other variants, the now-extinct Oregon Rex being only one of them. Crossbreeding of cats with typical Oregon Rex features (genetic description: roro) and Cornish Rex (rr) and later with Devon Rex (rere) resulted in offspring with normal, non-curly coats. Research supported the fact that the Oregon Rex mutation represents a recessive allele (ro) of an own gene with the dominant wild type allele (Ro) and therefore was, in fact, genetically different from other Rex breeds.

Kansan Uutiset served the parties until their dissolution in 1990. The paper had close ties to the new Left Alliance, which was founded in 1990, but it did not declare itself the organ until 2000.

SKP and SKDL also directed the paper through its council and board. New arrangements were made after the parties were gone. A joint stock company was founded, and the new owners were, for example, left-wing trade unions, banks and foundations. The Left Alliance did not directly own any stocks.

It was recorded at Outhouse Studios, Reading. On their YouTube channel, there are several videos documenting the band's recording sessions. The album was leaked on the internet on 12 January 2009. Kerrang! magazine gave it their maximum KKKKK rating. Background The vocals for the album were recorded in 14 hours. On 18 July 2010 it was announced from the \\"Architects\\" Facebook account that they would be re-releasing \\"Hollow Crown\\" (in the UK only) as a deluxe edition on 16 August 2010. The deluxe edition was to include a DVD documentary on their previous 18 months of touring/ recording and a remix of the title track \\"Hollow Crown\\" by the guitarist and drummer Tom and Dan Searle. Style and themes This album marks a change in guitar tuning for the second time, now using C# standard on a majority of the tracks (drop B tuning being used on Ruin) and an alternate tuning similar to C# standard, but with the low C# tuned to G#. This tuning is featured on the tracks Early Grave and Borrowed Time. Also, they use a 7 string baritone (ESP LTD SC-607B Stephen Carpenter Signature) on the track Dead March, which is tuned to drop A. Stylistically, the band considered Hollow Crown as a natural progression from its predecessor. Hollow Crown album displays a significant increase in clean vocals from Sam Carter, as well as a change in his harsh vocals, from the lower register on Ruin to more high-pitched screams. Also in this album, there is a further departure from the band's mathcore roots, utilising more traditional song structures, simplified riffs and more melodic musicianship, as well as a fair usage of keyboards and drum programming. Carter has stated that the lyrics on the album are of a personal nature. He has said that he wrote about everyday life and things that happen to him, these are as simple as sitting in a car with friends or hating girls. Title and packaging The album title has had different value to each member of the band. Dan Searle in interview was asked why the band gave it the title and he stated to him it refers to \\"those people you meet in life that earn nothing, but are given everything.\\" During an interview in October 2009 vocalist and lyricist Sam Carter stated that the inspiration for him when picking the name was because despite the band's hard working nature they never seemed to progress, saying \\"we’ve always felt like we were a band that worked really, really hard and we never got appreciation for it\\". Reception The album was well received by critics. Kerrang! magazine described it as a \\"carefully layered and brilliantly crafted [record]\\". In 2012, British publication Rock Sound added Architects' album Hollow Crown into their 101 Modern Classics placed at number 76. They considered the album more of a classic than The Offspring's Americana and Bullet For My Valentine's The Poison. Stating that \\"back when they were young, hungry and out to impress, Architects wrote this face-melting collection of rippers and made the world sit up.\\" When Sam Carter was asked in 2018 whether the band would re-visit the album in full in-line for its ten- year anniversary he was dismissive, saying \\"I don’t see that us as that band. Also it would never be the original line-up, it would never be what it was. I love ‘Hollow Crown’ because I was a really angry 18 year old that didn't know how to look after his voice.

Only three of their children survived infancy. Anne was the oldest, John was the middle child, and Christopher was the youngest. He wrote poetry from 1645–1674 during the English Renaissance. Milton was educated under a strong Protestant influence and attended Christ's College, Cambridge with the intention of pursuing a career as a minister. During his college years, Milton produced his poems L'Allegro and Il Penseroso. After leaving Cambridge, Milton changed his mind about his future, and hesitated during many years of study. Instead, he spent time composing poetry, which led to the production of the dramatic verse of Arcades and Comus. After the death of his mother, Milton left England to tour Europe. Upon returning, Milton was brought into the realm of political writing and he began a career composing political tracts which put forth his views on state and religious matters. He first supported the presbyterian leaders who were lining up in England behind Stephen Marshall; a few years later he would promote more radical views. Parents Milton's parents were John Milton, Sr. (1562–1647), a composer and scrivener, and his wife Sara Jeffrey (1572–1637).Hill 1979, p. 210. John Milton, Sr.'s business owned many properties and was involved in making loans.Shawcross 1993, p. 17. He was from a yeoman family and was raised in Oxford where he trained as a chorister. However, when Richard Milton, his father and a staunch Roman Catholic, discovered that John Milton, Sr. had Protestant leanings, he disinherited his son. John Milton, Sr. left for London and became a scrivener apprentice in 1583. Little is known about Sara Jeffrey besides that Paul Jeffrey, her father, was a tailor and her mother was Ellen, who lived with the Miltons until her death in 1611. The two married around 1600 and buried an unnamed child on 12 May 1601.Lewalski 2003, pp. 2–4. John Milton, Sr. ran his business from his home on Bread Street. He was constantly at work, and only took a partial day off the day his son was born. In 1633, John Milton, Sr. became warden for the Chapel of St Paul. He continued his job as a scrivener until 1636, when he left the Company of Scriveners's Court of Assistants and he moved his family from Hammersmith to Horton.Campbell 2003, p. 487. While not working as a scrivener, John Milton, Sr. composed music, which brought him into a close relationship with other musicians and composers including Henry Lawes, who proved influential in commissioning the young Milton's masques.Lewalski 2003, p. 3. At least twenty of his compositions survived, and most of them contain a religious theme. His works were published in many collections, including Thomas Morley's Triumphs of Oriana (1601), William Leighton's The Tears or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul (1612) and Thomas Ravenscroft's The Whole Book of Psalms (1621), amongst others. He also composed poetry, and two poems, never published, are known to have existed: a sonnet and a poem dedicated to John Lane.ODNB Childhood Milton was born 6:30 a.m. on Friday 9 December 1608,Campbell 2003, p. 484. in Cheapside, London along Bread Street, near St. Paul's Cathedral. He was baptised at All Hallows Church on 20 December 1608.Campbell 2003, p. 485. At the time of Milton's birth, his father was 46 and mother 36. He had one older sister Anne; her date of birth is unknown. Milton had three younger siblings: Christopher, baptised 3 December 1615; Sara, baptised 15 July 1612 and died 6 August 1612; and Tabitha, baptised 30 January 1614 and died 3 August 1615.Lewalski 2003, p. 2. Milton attended church at All Hallows and was influenced by the minister Richard Stock, a Puritan who was anti-Catholic and emphasised the need to read the Bible. In addition to his time at church, he spent most of his early life near St. Paul's Cathedral and was privately tutored. From the ages of 5 and 7, Milton was taught how to read and write in English and Latin, along with arithmetic. Milton was provided with several tutors between the ages of 7 and 12, but one in particular, Thomas Young, would prove influential. Young was a Scottish Presbyterian who had moved south, was highly educated and respected by his peers. Young's religious views affected Milton, and he adopted both Puritan appearances and ideas during his tutoring.Lewalski 2003, pp. 4–5. Young was not the only major figure in Milton's early education; Milton acknowledged his father's care in teaching him many languages, including French, Italian, and Hebrew.Lewalski 2003, p. 11. After a few years, he was sent to St. Paul's School, which was run by Alexander Gil, William Sound, and Oliver Smythe. Gil had a reputation for scholarship in Greek, Latin, and theology. He was also a proponent of English grammar structures and relied on poetry, including that written by Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney, to discuss the English language. Milton travelled each day between school and home, and his path took him by St Paul's. It is possible that he listened to the sermons put on during this time by John Donne.Lewalski 2003, pp. 6–8. John Aubrey, in Brief Lives, quotes his brother Christopher to describe how Milton spent his time: \\"When he went to school, when he was very young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night; and his father ordered the main to sit up for him\\".qtd in Masson, 1881 p. 85.Oliver Lawson Dick, Aubrey's Brief Lives (1962 edition), pp. 270–5. Milton later attributed his blindness, in his Defensio Secunda, to the rigorous study that he undertook during this time.Lewalski, p. 6. There is little evidence about Milton's time at St. Paul's, because the school's records were lost in a fire during the late 17th century. The actual date of Milton's start at the school is uncertain, further than estimate in the range from 1615 to 1622. According to accounts by Edward Phillips, Milton's nephew, and by Christopher Milton, Milton started at the school during his earliest years. However, Phillips states that Milton went to school with his brother, which ambiguous phrasing pushes the date to 1622. Milton, in his Defensio Secunda, claims that he began his deeper studies at the age of 12, which places the date after 1620. While at the school, Milton befriended Charles Diodati, and the two kept up a regular correspondence of letters and poetry. It is certain that the friendship was established Diodati before Diodati left to study at Oxford in early 1623. Milton composed his first hymn in 1623, and, in 1624, his earliest completed poem, \\"A Paraphrase on Psalm 114\\". \\"A Paraphrase on Psalm 114\\" describes how the Jews were led by God out of Egypt, the miracle of the parting of the Red Sea, and their eventual arrival in Canaan. The psalm emphasises the importance of the father figure and serves as an early model for the relationship between father and son in Milton's later works, including Paradise Lost (God and Son) and Samson Agonistes (Manoa and Samson).Shawcross 1993, pp. 18–19. College alt=Engraving of John Milton at age 21 by William Gardiner On 12 February 1625, Milton was admitted into Christ's College, Cambridge as a minor pensioner. Christ's under Thomas Bainbrigg, Master from 1622, was harmonious on religious questions, a great contrast to the situation some years earlier when Valentine Carey had clashed with William Ames, and the fellowship of 13 included a range of views.Campbell & Corns 2008, p. 26 and p. 392, n. 10. Milton matriculated on 9 April 1625 with William Chappell as his tutor.Campbell 2003, p. 486. He intended, according to the Subscription Book, to become a minister, and his course of study at Cambridge was based around this vocation. More of Milton's studies at Cambridge is unknown, but he did begin to study with Chappell, who was a respected scholar and became a staunch Arminian and Laudian. Milton would have attended lectures by Samuel Collins, Robert Creighton, and Robert Metcalfe, in addition to hearing Richard Sibbes and George Herbert preach.Lewalski, pp. 19–20. The Fellow of Christ's with the greatest reputation for his contemporaries was Joseph Mede,Campbell & Corns 2008, p. 28. but it has not been shown that he had personal influence on Milton. It has been argued that Milton later took from Mede's writings some conceptions on the millennium.Hutton 2003, pp.35–7. When the plague hit England in August 1625, the University of Cambridge had to be shut down until December. Milton had been there only for a few months before he had an altercation with Chappell and he was rusticated by this time. It is possible that the conflict originated in Chappell's Arminianism conflicting with Milton's Calvinistic views.Lewalski, p. 21. He was suspended temporarily from the college, and returned to London from April to July 1625.Campbell 2003, pp. 486–487. During this period, Milton composed many of his earlier poems; his poems on the Gunpowder Plot, his Hobson poems, and his An Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester were written while working on various college exercises. Other poems, such as On the Morning of Christ's Nativity or On Time, Upon the Circumcision, and At a Solemn Music, were written during Milton's free time.Shawcross 1993, p. 18. When Milton returned in 1626, he changed his tutor, because Chappell had wanted Milton removed from the college completely. His new tutor, Nathaniel Tovey, was a friend to both Diodati's family and to Chappell, which eased the personal problems. Tovey's views were Calvinist, and he was a Ramist in logic, a style followed later by Milton in his Art of Logic.Hill 1977, p. 34. Milton spent time writing Latin verse with other students, including Elegy II, which honoured Richard Ridding after his death 26 September 1626. Another elegy was written for the vice-chancellor, John Gostlin, who died on 21 October 1626. In the poem, Milton relies on Horatian poetics. The poem was placed first among the Latin poems in his 1645 collection. It is possible that the work was partly from an early poem that was then expanded in memory of Gostlin. In Elegy III, Milton honours Lancelot Andrewes, the Bishop of Winchester, who died 25 September 1626. In the poem, he also honours two others, whose deaths compounded his time of mourning, and the many Protestants who died during the Thirty Years War.Lewalski, pp. 21–24. He received a bachelor's degree in 1629. In 1630, Milton composed \\"On Shakespeare\\". The poem became the first poem of Milton's to be published, and it was including anonymously in the Second Folio of Shakespeare's Works.Shawcross 1993, p. 25. During this time, Milton began composing a series of love-sonnets, with seven of the poems written during his college years and a final set of three written after 1642.Shawcross 1993, p. 27. In 1632, he received a master of arts degree. He graduated cum laude, but the route into academia was blocked to him by the Christ's College statutes, there already being a Fellow of London origins, Michael Honywood.Hill 1979, p. 33 n 13; online. Early writing After graduating from Cambridge, Milton returned to live with his parents in Hammersmith, for a long \\"studious retirement\\".Shawcross 1993, p. 13. During this period, extending from 1630 to 1638, Milton hesitated over a career and composed his Arcades, A Mask (better known as Comus, a title it acquired only in 1738 at the hands of John Dalton), and Lycidas. Both Arcades and A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634 were masques commissioned by the family of John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater through the influence of Lawes, the Earl's music tutor for his children. Arcades was written to honour Alice Spencer, Countess Dowager of Derby, and performed on her estate at Harefield west of London; the date is debated, perhaps in October 1632 as the family tried to put behind it the scandal of the execution of her son-in-law Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven for sexual offences,Lewalski, 2003, p. 58. or on her 75th birthday, 4 May 1634.Shawcross 1993, p. 28. A Mask was performed for Michaelmas eve, 29 September 1634, at Ludlow Castle, the Earl of Bridgewater's residence. This masque differed in some ways from other masques of the time, in that it was longer and did not rely as much on music. The text was revised and published in 1638.Shawcross 1993, p. 29. Milton was a theatre-goer in his youth, as he mentions in Elegy I, and his dramatic work on masques, though the genre was closely associated with court entertainments, has been seen as suggestive of a reforming rather than a negative attitude to drama, in contrast to militant critics such as William Prynne from the Puritan side.Martin Butler, Theatre and Crisis 1632–1642 (1984), pp. 98–9. Milton's family moved out west from Hammersmith to Horton during 1636, further into the English countryside. In November 1638, Milton wrote Lycidas and the work was published in a collection of other memorial works for Edward King, who had attended Christ's College with Milton, published that year.Shawcross 1993, p. 30. While Milton knew King, who had been elected to a fellowship, it is not clear they were close friends. Lycidas is a thoughtful elegy in the pastoral style, and it appeared over the initials J.M.Hill 1977, pp. 49–50. Travels in Europe In April 1637, Sara Milton died, and Milton used the opportunity to distance himself from his family. After money was provided for the care of his father, now retired, Milton left to tour Europe in May 1638. This early \\"Grand Tour\\" of France, Italy and Switzerland lasted until either July or August 1639. While they did not follow the later model of tutelage and instruction for a young man of good financial position straight from university, Milton's travels brought him directly to the urban centres of Europe from a life in semi-rural Horton; and Milton was exposed to various artistic and religious traditions, especially the Catholic world, and current political thought. He also met numerous celebrated theorists and intellectuals to whom he was able to display his poetic skills. As to specific details, only a general account is preserved, and there is just one major source: Milton's own Defensio Secunda. Although there are other records, some letters, some mentions in his other prose tracts and the rest, the bulk of the information therefore comes from a work that, according to Barbara Lewalski, \\"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasize his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\\"Lewalski 2003, pp. 87–88. However, many of the major events can still be pieced together from various documents. He travelled a standard route relied on by other Englishmen touring Europe at the time. He first went to Calais and then on to Paris, riding horseback. He had brought a letter from diplomat Henry Wotton which allowed him to be introduced at the British embassy. From ambassador John Scudamore, Milton received other letters of introduction, and they proved their value as he received assistance from other Englishmen along his travels and met important individuals.Lewalski 2003, pp. 88–89. Scudamore introduced him directly to Hugo Grotius, whom Milton called \\"a most learned man\\" and one \\"I ardently desired to meet\\"Milton 1959, Vol II, p. 414. Grotius was a Dutch jurist and major philosopher of law, playwright and poet; he was a defender of Arminianism and believer in religious toleration, and his views on theology and politics were in some ways similar to Milton's own. However, Milton quickly left France after this meeting, after visiting a few landmarks including the Louvre and Notre Dame de Paris; Cyriack Skinner, his assistant, explains that Milton did not appreciate the French regime, under the control of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, who were anti- Huguenot. Milton travelled south to Nice and then on to Genoa. He then journeyed to Livorno and Pisa, seeing the Leaning Tower. He reached Florence around July 1638 and stayed there until September. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. He also met many intellectuals and attended social and artistic events. He enjoyed spending time in the Florentine academies that claimed to operate in a similar fashion to Plato's Symposium. In particular, Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the Academia della Crusca along with smaller academies in the area including the Apastisti, operated by Milton's friend Carlo Dati, and the Svogliati, operated by Jacopo Gaddi. While at the Svogliati, Milton read some of his neo- Latin poetry. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry made him many friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met a number of famous and influential people through these connections including the astronomer Galileo at Arcetri, Benedetto Buonmattei, Antonio Malatesti, and others. Although Milton enjoyed himself in Florence, he left in September to continue onward to Rome.Lewalski 2003, pp. 90–94. Now with many connections from Florence, Milton had easy access to Rome's intellectual circles, including groups like the Fantastici. His poetic abilities impressed such as Giovanni Salzilli, who honoured Milton in an epigram; this praise was later mentioned in the preface to the Latin portion of Milton's Poems of 1645. In return for this poetic generosity, Milton returned the favour in his Latin Ad Salzillum, which discusses his own merits and laments that Salzilli was ill at the time. In late October, Milton, despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus, attended a dinner given by the English College, Rome, meeting English Catholics who were also guests, theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary.Chaney, 1985 and 2000, and Lewalski, p. 96. There is little else known about this time beyond that he met David Codner, an English Benedictine with court connections, who also praised Milton's poetry, and that he attended various musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for Naples near the end of November and he stayed only for a month, finding that Spanish control diminished the local intellectual and artistic community.Chaney, 1985, pp. 244–51 and Chaney, 2000, p. 313. He was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giovanni Battista Marino. Manso became Milton's guide through Naples and gifted Milton with books and a distich that teases Milton through Gregory the Great's pun on \\"Angle\\" and \\"angel\\" when describing the English. Milton responded in his Mansus that he was grateful for the gesture of good will and claims Manso as his patron. Milton had wanted to travel to Sicily and then on to Greece; but he started to retrace his steps, and after lingering on the way home he returned to England during the summer of 1639. He claimed in Defensio SecundaLewalski 2003, pp. 94–98. that his plans were changed by \\"sad tidings of civil war in England.\\"Milton 1959, Vol IV, part I, pp. 618–619. It is possible, as he wrote later, that he was warned by a group of merchants that there was a plot to murder him if he was to re-enter Rome. This claim could be merely an exaggeration to reinforce himself as a defender of Protestantism. However, Milton's theological frankness did limit what Manso could do for him as patron. A lingering reputation is suggested by what Nicolaas Heinsius, a Dutch poet, later wrote:Lewalski 2003, pp. 98–99. \\"That Englishman was hated by the Italians, among whom he lived a long time, on account of his over- strict morals, because he both disputed freely about religion, and on any occasion whatever prated very bitterly against the Roman Pontiff.\\"Heinsius 1991, pp. 526–527. Regardless, these were all points that Milton later took pride in. He actually spent two months in Rome on his return journey. He arrived in time to experience Carnival and its festivities. Also, Milton met Lukas Holste, a Vatican librarian, and was given a personal tour through the library and its vast collection of books and manuscripts. Through Holste, Milton was also introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, and was able to view the opera Chi soffre speri, hosted by the Cardinal. Milton later praised Barberini, steering away from theological subjects. He also experienced a concert of Leonora Baroni, writing a few Latin epigrams in tribute. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence and stayed there for two months. While there, he attended further meetings of the academies and spent time with the friends that he made on his previous visit. After leaving Florence, he travelled to Lucca and passed through Bologna and Ferrara along the way.Lewalski 2003, pp. 99–106. He stopped in Venice for a month and experienced various operates and other theatrical and musical events. Venice also showed him a Republican form of government that he later admired as promoting freedom. While in Italy, Milton's childhood friend, Diodati, had died. Milton composed an elegy in memory of Diodati, and included a headnote saying that they \\"had pursued the same studies\\" and that they were the \\"most intimate friends from childhood on\\".qtd in Lewalski 2003, p. 9. It took Milton seven months in all to return finally to England, with the trip extended from Venice as he visited Giovanni Diodati, his friend's uncle, in Geneva. There he encountered Calvinism in power and another model republic. He was introduced to the various scholars and theologians of the region. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving in England in either July or August 1639.Lewalski 2003, pp. 106–109. Published author His tour over, Milton within two years found roles and independence in teaching and controversy. By the summer of 1642, which also marked the outbreak of the First English Civil War, he felt ready to marry.Lewalski 2003, p. 156. Milton's early poetry, written from 1624 onwards, was eventually published in December 1645. This work contained both Milton's English poetry and his Latin poetry. Only three poems were not included, but they were eventually introduced into the 1673 edition of the poems. The frontispiece of the work, by William Marshall, depicted Milton at the age of 21.Shawcross 1993, p. 20. Milton returned to England, in late 1639, in the interlude between the two Bishops' Wars. Rather than living with his father, he found accommodation of his own in London, and began tutoring. He lived for a year near St Bride's Church, and moved in 1640 a short way to Aldersgate, just outside the City proper. His first pupils were his young nephews, Edward Phillips and John Phillips, sons of his sister Anne and both later known as writers. Milton's 1644 intervention Of Education in debate on pedagogy is based on his practical experience, as well as stating his own relationship to humanist tradition. At this period he was casting around for a literary project, compiling long lists of possible Biblical and historical topics, abandoning the idea of an Arthurian work and considering subjects mainly in a dramatic light.Lewalski, 2003, pp. 123–125. Political events now began to unfold rapidly; and controversial publications, particularly on episcopacy, sprang up in a pamphleteering battle. During his early years, Milton had been placed under Thomas Young for tutoring. Now 30 years later, Young was one of five clerics of presbyterian views who formed Smectymnuus. The group, titled after a combination of each contributor's initials, wrote on antiprelatical matters, and Young encouraged Milton to write his first prose work, Of Reformation (1641), to aid in their cause. In all, Milton's antiprelatical tracts amounted to five pamphlets written in the space of a year. Of these, only the fourth carried his name, but he took on easily the role of polemicist, both lofty and resorting to low gibes and scurrility.Lewalski, 2003, pp. 135–141. At the same time as the final pamphlet of the series, May 1642, Milton married Marie Powell (see John Milton's relationships). The marriage was short-lived, as the First English Civil War broke out, for reasons not fully explained, but set off Milton's divorce tracts, another polemical series of pamphlets beginning in 1643. Milton's advocacy of divorce pushed him away from Puritan orthodoxy, and led on to Areopagitica of 1644 against censorship, his most lasting prose work.

The church address is 1515 Baldwin Street; ancillary buildings are located at 1491 Baldwin Street (Rectory) and 1480 Townsend Street (School Building). The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History In the late 1850s, Belgian Catholics immigrated to Detroit and settled in the eastside neighborhoods near Gratiot and Baldwin. In 1886, a parish dedicated to St. Charles Borromeo was established to minister to this congregation. A wood- frame church was constructed for the parish, and quickly expanded. As Detroit grew, the parish grew along with it, with French, German, Irish, Scotch, and English immigrant congregants in addition to the original Belgians. By 1920, the congregation numbered over 3000. By the 1930s, the school's population also included many Catholic children of Syrian and Italian immigrants. In 1912, the two-story rectory and school was designed and built by Van Leyen & Schilling. In 1918, Peter Dederichs was awarded a contract to build an \\"edifice of Romanesque style for religious use\\". Just four years after the church was completed, it was expanded to meet the needs of the growing congregation. The church is still used today, although the congregation has altered. The rectory serves its original function, and the school is leased by the Church of Messiah. Description The St. Charles Borromeo parish complex consists of four buildings, three of which are historically significant: the church itself, the rectory, and the school. The church is built with red-brown tapestry brick on a white Bedford stone foundation, with trim of the same stone. The church is built in a Latin Cross plan, 92 feet across and 180 feet in depth. The design is Romanesque with Arts and Crafts elements. The front facade is flanked by asymmetric towers with red tiled hip-roofs. The entranceway is within a two-story arched structure with columns on each side, above which is a large rose window. Rosettes are in the spandrels above the entrance arches, and green tile fills the spandrels and pediments of the front and side facades. The decorative brick pilasters around the central arch are derived from Prairie School or Arts and Crafts models. The main altar is Baroque in style. The organ was built in two sections to clear the rose window above the main entrance. The school and rectory were designed in the Prairie style with some Byzantine elements.

The clan does not have a chief recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Craig is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. Per the Lord Lyon King of Arms, no clan society, association or organization is recognised as an \\"official Representor\\" of an Armigerous Clan. Armigerous clans have no official Representor, as they do not have a Chief or Commander recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The only official Representor of a Scottish Clan is the Chief or Commander officially recognized in their letters patent, or more common when a Warrant has been issued by the Court of the Lord Lyon. The Clan Craig Association of America (and other clan Craig organisations), however, are an important clansman charged with business matters of the clan. The primary responsibility of all Armigerous Clan societies and associations is to find a chief or commander and bring legitimacy and honour back to their family name. [Ref. Adam/Innes. \\"Clans, Sept & Regiment of the Scottish Highlands\\"] The Scottish surname Craig is derived from the Gaelic creag meaning \\"rocky hill\\". The surname is a topographic name for a person who lived near a steep rock, and often prefixed to the names of places in hilly or mountainous districts in various parts of Scotland. The name seems to belong particularly to the north of Scotland. John of the Craig (Johannes Del Crag) of Aberdeenshire led a party of 300 men into the Battle of Culblean in 1335. It is believed that John of the Craig was Laird of the Craig of Auchindoir - the estate next to the Den of Craig in the Parish of Auchindoir.W. Douglas-Simpson, Castle Craig and the Kirk of Auchindoir, Aberdeenshire. 1929-30 According to George Fraser Black, during the 15th century there were three families that styled themselves \\"of that Ilk\\" (meaning that the name of the family is the same as that of the place they come from i.e. Craig of Craig). The Craigs of Craigfintry - later Riccarton - became the most noted family. Thomas Craig of Riccarton 1538-1608, lawyer and writer, was descended from William Craig of Craigfintry\\"Life of Thomas Craig\\", An account of the life and writings of Sir Thomas Craig of Riccarton By Patrick Fraser Tytler - retrieved 10 February 2010.\\"Pedigree of Craig\\" Visitation of England and Wales, Volume 5, 1903 - retrieved 09.03.2010 (later Craigston) in Aberdeenshire, who was born in the last half of the 15th century. William Craig's second son (also named William Craig of Craigfintry) fought against the English at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, where he was slain. The last lineal descendant of the Craigs of Riccarton was Robert Craig of Riccarton who died in 1823 leaving no heirs.\\"Old and New Edinburgh\\", Grant, James.

The estate of Riccarton passed to Mr. James Gibson who assumed the name and arms of Craig, changing his name to James Gibson-Craig. Members of Clan Craig may wear a crest badge containing the crest of a chevalier on horseback in full charge grasping a broken lance in bend Proper, and the Latin motto VIVE DEO ET VIVES meaning \\"live for God and you shall have life\\".

It was established by the Aktiengesellschaft der Lokalbahn Deggendorf-Metten, a railway company in eastern Bavarian that built and operated this standard gauge line between the two towns. The company was founded, on the one hand, to provide a railway link to the town of Metten, well known for its monastery (Kloster Metten) and, on the other hand, to export stone from the granite quarries in the surrounding area. The concession was issued on 7 September 1890. That same year construction started and, on 17 October 1891, it was opened to traffic. The length of the Paterbahn, as it was called in the local dialect, was 4.22 kilometres. In addition, in Metten there was a 1.1 kilometre long branch to the quarries. The two steam locomotives that worked the line were called Deggendorf (Krauss 1891/ 2451 - B n2t - 1,435 mm, scrapped in 1965) and Metten (Krauss 1891/ 2452 - B n2t - 1,435 mm, scrapped in 1953). The line was taken over on 1 February 1928 by the Regentalbahn AG who continued to operate it. They worked it with their locomotive Osser (Maffei 1922/ 5478 - C h2t - 1,435 mm) as well as the 'new' Deggendorf (Maffei 1927/ 5684 - D h2t - 1,435 mm). On 6 November 1975 the last steam train ran down the line. On 23 September 1983 the last passenger train was underway. Goods traffic ceased in 1991 and on 1 August 1993 the line was finally closed.

Much of the path is steep and rugged terrain, and presents many mountain vistas. The trail traverses the Massanutten Range around its inner valley. Shenandoah National Park is to the east, and Great North Mountain is west. History The trail has its origins in the American Revolutionary War. Originally known as Morgan's Road, a portion of the trail at Veach Gap was built as a potential avenue for retreat in case the Continental Army had been defeated at the battle of Yorktown. George Washington had Daniel Morgan construct the road over the eastern ridge into the valley. In the 19th century, the area was used for mining and the production of charcoal. Elizabeth Furnace was a blast furnace utilized to create pig iron. Signal Knob, a peak on the northern end of the trail, was used by the Signal Corps of both armies in the Civil War. In 1933, Camp Roosevelt, located on the eastern part of the trail, was established as the first Civilian Conservation Camp. In the latter half of the 20th century, there were many trails established in the Massanutten area. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club had envisioned a long distance trail there since the 1960s, and in 2002 the Circuit Trail was completed. Animals and Plants There are a variety of birds, reptiles and mammals in the area. White-tailed deer, gray squirrels, red and gray fox, rattlesnakes, black bears, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, and bobcats may be spotted by the hiker. The trail also features many eastern wildflowers. Activities The trail sees a variety of user activity, including hiking and backpacking. Since the trail is a circuit, it presents a good opportunity to thru-hike. The trail is well marked by orange blazes and easy to follow. Challenges for the hiker include steep ascents and descents in elevation, rocky terrain, and few water supply points. There are backcountry camp spots along the trail, and a primitive shelter in the Little Crease area. In addition, there are primitive campgrounds located near the trail, including the Elizabeth Furnace and Camp Roosevelt area. Hikers should be aware that the area is popular with hunters in the fall and should exercise necessary caution. Mountain biking and trail running are also popular activities on the Massanutten Trail. The Virginia Happy Trails Running Club holds the annual Massanutten Mountain Trails 100 Mile Run ultramarathon in the spring. Other events that use the trail are the Old Dominion 100 Run ultramarathon, and the Old Dominion 100 Ride equestrian event.

In November 1961 St. Vital Mayor Fred Brennan applied to Metro Council for a $30,000-40,000 ski and toboggan slide. Floodlights for nighttime skiing were installed the next month. At some point in the late 1960s Metro took over responsibility for the Park. An international archery competition, featuring archers from Canada and the United States was held in Maple Grove Park July 4-5, 1970 to celebrate Manitoba's centennial.

At its peak population in 1901, Mafeking was home to about four families.  History  The first log schoolhouse was built in the area in 1861, and was replaced by a permanent brick structure in 1924. Known officially as SS#9 but more commonly referred to as Finlay's School or Mafeking School, the one room schoolhouse operated from 1924 until 1967 and had 45 pupils graduate during its tenure. The building was also used as the township hall until the Ashfield Municipal Road Shed was built in the adjacent lot. The school still stands on Belgrave Road but is now used primarily for storage. The first post office was opened in Mafeking in 1900 by William Stuthers who was also postmaster from 1911 until its closure in 1915 when it was amalgamated into the RR#7 Lucknow postal route.

The name of the community was changed to McKinley in 1849 in honor of John McKinley, a U.S. Senator and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The town grew rapidly in the 1850s and became the second largest in Marengo County, after Demopolis. Around thirty large plantations surrounded the settlement. By 1860 the community had Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches, two schools, several general stores, a brick drug store, livery stables, two-story carriage repair shop, saddle and harness shop, hotel, three shoe shops, an undertaker, tanning yard, brickyard, and grist mill. In 1860 a fire destroyed everything on the east side of Main Street, except for the hotel. A second fire in 1869 destroyed practically the entire town.

Formed in 1979 by Terry Kelly and Richard Daly, it is now part of Weather Central, another of Kelly's companies. History After graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1971 with a degree in meteorology, Terry Kelly took a job with Madison, Wisconsin, television station WKOW calculating weather predictions. Over the next two years he introduced a number of new techniques to the industry, including using magnets to represent high and low points, color markers on a whiteboard for graphics, and later hand-photographing satellite cloud imagery with a Bolex camera to produce the first cloud-movement animations.Nelson, pg. 306 Kelly and several of his colleagues also produced weather forecasting software. In 1974 he was promoted to chief meteorologist at WKOW, and at the same time started Weather Central to sell and operate their software for smaller organizations such as ski resorts and local highway departments. ColorGraphics was formed in 1979 as a partnership between Kelly and Richard Daly. Kelly and Daly had both worked in the University of Wisconsin's Space Science and Engineering department, developers of the McIDAS weather display system. McIDAS used downloaded satellite cloud cover images and superimposed them on locally generated maps. Designed for the National Weather Service, McIDAS was a high-end system well beyond the budget of a television station.Nelson, pg. 302 Kelly's idea was to adapt the McIdas concept for lower cost home computer systems that were appearing in the late 1970s. Their first system, \\"LiveLine\\", was based on the Apple II. Its graphics system could not be genlocked, so a TV camera had to be pointed at the screen to send the video into the production systems. This initial system was soon replaced by a similar one running on Cromemco computers using a modified version of their Dazzler color-graphics card.Robert Kuhmann, \\"Cromemco S-100 computer ~ a Silicon Valley memoir (1977-1997)\\", January 2008 In spite of its simplicity and low resolution, the fast production and \\"high tech\\" look caught on, and by the mid-1980s the system was almost universal, replacing bluescreen systems on cardboard maps that had previously been used.Nelson, pg. 303 The company notes that 70% of the top 50 TV markets were using the system by 1982.\\"Weather Central History\\" In 1982 the company was purchased by Dynatech, an expanding electronics company. Dynatech purchased Cromemco in 1987 and rolled the two companies together, before divesting all of its media properties in the early 1990s. Kelly and Daly purchased the rights back from Dynatech in 1994, operating under the Weather Central name. In 1995 they introduced the new \\"GENESIS\\" platform on Silicon Graphics computers, which later moved onto Hewlett-Packard workstations.

All European Union member states are required to conduct a Labour Force Survey annually. Labour Force Surveys are also carried out in some non-EU countries. They are used to calculate the International Labour Organization (ILO)-defined unemployment rate. The ILO agrees the definitions and concepts employed in Labour Force Surveys. History =European Union= Prior to 1998, EU member states were required to conduct an LFS in one quarter per year, but as a result of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 577/98 of 9 March 1998 they are now expected to submit LFS results for every quarter to Eurostat. Responsibility for sample selection, questionnaire design and fieldwork lies with member states' national statistical offices, who then forward the results to Eurostat, employing a common coding scheme. The EU LFS, as it is known, covers not only the EU member states but also three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) and candidate countries. United Kingdom The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducted the United Kingdom's first Labour Force Survey in 1973 and repeated it every two years until 1983. It is curated by the UK Data Service and can be accessed for research through them . The European Community then introduced a requirement for all of its member states to conduct an LFS and the ONS introduced a quarterly element to its LFS. The UK switched to a full quarterly survey in 1992, initially with seasonal quarters but moving to calendar quarters in 2006. =Australia= The first Australian LFS was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in November 1960. Initially, the LFS was conducted only in state capitals, in February, May, August, and November, but in February 1964 it was rolled out to the whole of Australia. The last quarterly survey was conducted in November 1977. The LFS became monthly in February 1978, when the range of topics covered was increased and the LFS measure became the official measure of unemployment. =New Zealand= New Zealand's quarterly Household Labour Force Survey was established in December 1985. It was revised in 1990 to include new variables including underemployment. Usage In addition to being used to generate official statistics, data from the LFS are employed by academics and other researchers. In the UK, for example, the LFS has been used as a data source for research projects on topics such as female employment, the economic returns to education, migration and ethnic minority groups.

He won seven Academy Awards and was nominated for a further 13 in the category of Best Art Direction. He worked on 265 films between 1923 and 1970. He was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and died in Hollywood, California.  Early life  Day was born on 9 May 1896 in Victoria, British Columbia to Patience Day and Robert Scott. His father was an architect who began his career in South Africa. As a child, Day developed a spinal curvature that prevented him from attending school and was instead home-schooled. He never graduated high school or pursued higher education. Day was a Captain in the Canadian Army during World War I. While stationed in London, he met his future wife who was a nurse's aide. The couple married in London in 1918.  Career  After the war, Day returned to Canada and attempted to begin a career as a commercial artist. In 1920, his father financed a trip to Hollywood in hopes that Day would find a job in the film industry. He was unsuccessful until a chance encounter with director Erich von Stroheim in a hotel lobby led von Stroheim to offer Day work on the film Foolish Wives (1922). Day served as art director on all of von Stroheim's films thereafter, apart from von Stroheim's only sound film, Walking Down Broadway (eventually released as Hello, Sister! in 1933). Day followed von Stroheim to MGM, working there through most of the 1920s. In 1929, he left MGM to join Samuel Goldwy. He served as Golywyn's principal art director throughout most of the 1930s. During that time, he won Academy Awards for his production design for The Dark Angel (1935) and Dodsworth (1936). Other films during this period include Dead End (1937) and John Ford's The Hurricane (1937). He then moved to 20th Century Fox, where he was Supervising Art Director. He personally worked on selected films such as How Green Was My Valley (1941), for which he won his third Academy Award. During World War II, Day independently developed camouflage designs and relief mapping techniques. He was eventually inducted into the Marine Corps as a Major. Day became a U.S. citizen in 1942 as a prerequisite to joining the Marines. Once in the service, he devised a technique to make relief models of assault landing sites out of mud and other available materials.

Desiring to be some place where he won't have to study or behave, Juma seeks the help of a magical jinn (in English, a genie), a decision which leads Juma on misadventures. In the same year the book was published, Juma and the Magic Jinn won a 1986 Golden Kite Award for Mikolaycak's illustrations. These illustrations additionally played a role in Mikolaycak receiving the 1987 Kerland Award \\"in recognition of singular attainments in the creation of children's literature.\\" Background Juma and the Magic Jinn is an African folklore inspired children's book written Joy Anderson and illustrated by Charles Mikolaycak (26 January 1937 – 23 June 1993). The book illustrations use double-page spreads to capture a sequential picture style containing an attention to details, colours, and African setting patterns. Targeted for children ages 6–9, the folktale takes place on Lamu, a real island just off the East coast of Kenya that was established as early as the fourteenth century by Arab traders and is populated with Moslems. It was Anderson's visit to the island that inspired the University of Central Florida adjunct professor to write about a present-day boy who had a fairy-tale adventure. Plot View of the seaside on Lamu Island On the seafaring Lamu Island, families traditionally keep a jinn jar at home. The jinn jar is a container that holds a supernatural being in Islam and Arabian mythology called a jinn (in English, a genie). The jinn jar is kept sealed because the owners do not know if their magic jinn is good or evil, which makes people of Lamu Island generally afraid of the jinns. The story opens with a young student named Juma daydreaming in a school instead of doing his mathematics. Since the young Juma concentrates more on his own directions of thought rather than the lessons being taught, the teacher sends Juma home. On the way home, he comes across his mother buying fish at the shore. His mother admonishes his daydreaming in school and suggests that Juma may be better off working with his father to cut mangrove poles. She instruction Juma to go home, but instructs Juma to not touch the jinn jar. At home, Juma disobeys his mother's prior instructions and removes the cork sealing the jinn jar and calls the jinn. Juma is sceptical about his efforts and does not believe in magic. However, the magic jinn appears, in this instance as a \\"young woman with black and smiling catlike eyes,\\" whose dark hair is tied with amber beads. The jinn offers to grant Juma wishes. Desiring to be some place where he won't have to study or behave, Juma formulates his wishes to overcome his need for schooling, particularly math and writing (\\"sums and script\\"). The magic jinn grants some of Juma's wishes and is sent away from his home on what turns out to be misadventures. Eventually, Juma is able to get home again but arrives with new appreciation of his home and family and realisation that learning can be exciting and fun. Reaction Juma and the Magic Jinn was published in 1986. In that same year, Juma and the Magic Jinn was awarded Honor Book in the picture book illustration category of Golden Kite Award. In February 1987, the dark, rich color illustrations in the African folklore book were singled out as strong and handsome elements that emphasise the mystery of the tale. These and other illustrations lead to Mikolaycak receiving the 1987 Kerland Award \\"in recognition of singular attainments in the creation of children's literature.\\" From 12 September 1993 to 1 May 1994, the McKissick Museum at the University of South Carolina exhibited Juma and the Magic Jinn.

She first appears in Inhumans #5 (March 1999) and was created by Devin Grayson and J.G. Jones. She was trained as a spy and assassin in the Red Room. Originally a foe of Natasha Romanova sent to kill her, they later became allies. She was also a member of S.H.I.E.L.D., Vanguard and HYDRA, who changed her into a version of Super- Adaptoid. As Super-Adaptoid, she was one of the members of the High Council of A.I.M. She has reverted to her original codename Black Widow in 2017. Florence Pugh will portray the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Widow (2021). Publication history Belova, the second modern Black Widow after Natasha Romanova (Natasha Romanoff), was initially a post-Soviet Russian spy of the GRU. She debuted briefly in Inhumans vol. 2, #5 (March 1999), and was fully introduced in the 1999 Marvel Knights mini-series Black Widow. A second miniseries, also titled Black Widow and featuring Natasha Romanoff and Daredevil, followed in 2001. The next year, she did a solo turn in her own three-issue miniseries, also titled Black Widow (officially Black Widow: Pale Little Spider in the series' postal indicia) under the mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint. The June to August 2002 story arc, by writer Greg Rucka and artist Igor Kordey, was a flashback to the story of her becoming the second modern Black Widow, in events preceding her Inhumans appearance. Fictional character biography Belova is an amoral spy and assassin who was trained at the Red Room by the same spymasters who trained Natasha Romanoff, the first Black Widow. After the death of her trainer, Pyotr Vasilievich Starkovsky, she is activated as the new Black Widow and deployed to investigate. She apprehends and eliminates his killer, unaware that both his murder and the investigation were part of a ploy to get Belova to assert herself as the new Black Widow.Black Widow: Pale Little Spider #3 (August 2002) Believing herself to be the rightful successor to the title of \\"Black Widow\\", Yelena enthusiastically volunteers for a mission that will put her at odds with Natasha, although the meeting and confrontations between the two do not lead to a decisive battle. Natasha refers to Yelena as \\"little one\\" and \\"russkiya\\", meaning \\"Russian\\", and encourages her to find what makes her unique and her personal identity rather than blindly devote herself to her nation. Natasha later subjects Yelena to a cruel-but-necessary manipulation in order to shatter her illusions about the \\"Black Widow\\" title and teach her the reality of the espionage industry.Black Widow vol. 1, #1-3 (June - August 1999) Belova eventually retires to Cuba, where she becomes a successful businesswoman and model.Black Widow 2 vol. 1, #1 (November 2005) She is lured back, however, by the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and becomes involved in the agency's mining of vibranium in the Antarctic Savage Land.New Avengers vol 1, #5 (April 2005) Shortly afterward, she barely survives an attack by Sauron, receiving severe burns and being subsequently approached with an offer for revenge against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the New Avengers.New Avengers vol 1, #6 (June 2005) Belova is genetically altered by the terrorist organization HYDRA, as she had suffered debilitating and disfiguring injuries after her last encounter with the New Avengers in the Savage Land. HYDRA recruited her with the prospect of revenge and after hiring the services of A.I.M. transferred her mind into a new version of Super-Adaptoid. This body appeared as Belova had originally until it began to absorb powers, at which time it changed as the original did, though now yellow in color. Now equipped with the ability to copy all of the New Avengers' powers, she engages the superhero team in combat. She is eventually defeated by a combination of Tony Stark's 49 successive Iron Man armors—from the first, Tales of Suspense #39, to the then-current—and the Sentry's use of his Void persona, which she absorbs with the rest of the Sentry's powers and energy. When she is defeated, HYDRA disables her using a remote self-destruct mechanism they had implanted in her, rather than let her reveal intelligence to the New Avengers.New Avengers Annual vol 1, #1 (June 2006) She has returned working with a vigilante group, the Vanguard.Marvel Comics Presents vol. 2, #5 (March 2008) During the Dark Reign storyline, Quasimodo researched Yelena Belova for Norman Osborn.Dark Reign Files vol 1, #1 (April 2009) Yelena Belova appeared to join Osborn's Thunderbolts.Thunderbolts vol. 1, #128 (March 2009) However it was eventually revealed to be actually Natasha Romanova in disguise, acting as a double agent for Nick Fury.Thunderbolts vol. 1, #134 (July 2009) She believed she was disguised as Belova on Fury's behalf, planted for Osborn to find and invite into the Thunderbolts. However, Osborn revealed to her that he had tricked her into taking on Belova's appearance in order to get her to do his dirty work.Thunderbolts vol. 1, #135 (September 2009) After Natasha's escape from the Thunderbolts, Osborn then revealed the true Yelena in stasis to Scourge and warned him that she could be his replacement on the team.Thunderbolts vol. 1, #136 (September 2009) The real Yelena is later freed from stasis by members of A.I.M. who install the female Adaptoid on the High Council of A.I.M. (alongside Andrew Forson, Graviton, Jude the Entropic Man, Mentallo, Superia, and an undercover Taskmaster) as the Minister of State in Bagalia (a country populated by supervillains).Secret Avengers vol. 2, #2 (March 2013) After the death of the original Black Widow at the hands of Captain America's Hydra doppelganger then defeat at hands of the real Captain America in Secret Empire, Yelena began to reassume the Black Widow identity once again, but now to honor the late-Natasha. Sometimes during the world's restoration from Hydra's mess, Yelena travels around the world to assassinate the world's infamous generals and remaining Hydra's remnants, which caught the attentions of Natasha's former lovers, Winter Soldier and Hawkeye.Secret Empire: Omega vol. 1, #1 (September 2017)Tales of Suspense vol. 1, #100 - #101 (December - January, 2018 - 2019) Powers and abilities Black Widow is in peak athletic condition.

With the street beginning at Dodge Street, historically significant sections include those from Dodge to Lake Street, from Fort Street to Laurel Avenue, and from Weber to Bondesson Streets.  History  Twelve years before the city of Omaha was founded, Mormon pioneers built the Weber Mill at the long-time northern end of North 30th Street. The Florence Park, on North 30th Street, was the town square of Winter Quarters of the Mormon pioneers. The settlement eventually morphed into the town of Florence, and its main street was located along present-day North 30th. In 1856 town settlers built the Bank of Florence at present-day 8502 North 30th Street. In 1868 the Department of the Platte built Fort Omaha in the then-void between the town of Saratoga and Florence. Today the Fort is a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, with the Gen. George Crook House built in 1879 and the Omaha Landmark Guardhouse as contributing properties. The Fort's boundaries include North 30th Street. Originally built in 1887 at a different location in Florence, the Florence Depot was moved to North 30th Street in 1971 to serve as a museum. Miller Park was built in 1891 according to renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland's plans for the city. The current Howard Kennedy School building, serving as a public school along North 30th, was opened in 1916. The Harry Buford House was built by a leader in the city's African American community in 1929. Under the pretense of national security, in the 1940s the United States War Department approved the City of Omaha's application to widen North 30th Street to serve as the main arterial through the city's north side. The removal of the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company's streetcar line along the street was required for the project to be completed.Nebraska State Railway Commission. (1941) 34th Annual Report of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to the Governor. p 162. In 1953 Sabastiono Caniglia bought a restaurant at the intersection of Fort and North 30th Streets which eventually became his notable Mister C's. It closed in 2007. Neighborhoods Along with Florence, there are several notable historic neighborhoods that border North 30th Street. Beginning at Dodge Street in Downtown Omaha, the neighborhoods include Near North Omaha, Gifford Park, Miller Park and Minne Lusa.  Connections  In addition to serving as the city's thoroughfare for U.S. Route 75, there are several important traffic connections along North 30th. They include Dodge Street, which is the major east–west low-density arterial from the Missouri River to 90th Street, where it becomes West Dodge Road. The Sorensen Parkway begins at North 30th Street and runs west to North 90th Street as well. The street intersects I-680, as well as serving as the terminus of the North Freeway.

The tracery mouldings and corbels in the interior are extremely elegant; there are also some fine specimens of screen work: it consists of nave, chancel, side aisles, and an embattled tower, surmounted by an octagonal spire, and contains a peal of thirteen good bells.\\"History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Warwickshire, Francis White & Co. 1850 The bells were all recast and rehung in 1932 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, and the church registers date from 1538. The church is part of a team which includes *St Helen's Church, Solihull *St Michael's Church, Solihull In 2012, St Alphege Church celebrated the millennium of the martyrdom of St Alphege in 1012. In 2020, along with churches of other denominations in central Solihull, the Parish celebrated eight hundred years since the foundation of St Alphege Church, and so of Christianity in Solihull. Description The church is of cruciform plan with a chancel having a two- storied chapel north of it, a central tower, north and south transepts, a nave with north and south aisles and a north porch. It is the only medieval cruciform church in the Diocese of Birmingham and one of only four in the historic county of Warwickshire. There was originally a late 12th-century church on the site, of which the only evidence of this is the east end of the south wall of the nave with a blocked window, and the marks of its steeply pitched roof on the west face of the tower. It would have been shorter and slightly narrower than the present nave. The church was enlarged by Sir William de Odingsells with the chancel, and a vaulted chamber and chapel dedicated to St Alphege to the north of it. A north aisle with a chapel of St Thomas Becket was added to the nave and some remains of an arch between the two still exist. This was followed in the 14th century by the addition of the transepts, with the insertion of side-arches in the tower and the enlargement of those in the east and west walls. The rebuilding and widening of the north aisle followed, along with the north porch. A little later in the 14th century the aisle was continued westwards, beyond the original west end. The present aisle was added in 1535, when both arcades were rebuilt and the nave lengthened.A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 4: section: Parishes: Solihull, Hemlingford Hundred (1947), pp. 214-229. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42685; Date accessed: 23 February 2012. The top section of the tower was constructed in 1470, much later on than the lower part, probably near the date of other 15th-century work, likely undertaken before the nave and aisles were completed. The original stone spire collapsed in 1757 and was rebuilt soon afterwards to a lesser height. The south aisle, owing to a structural weakness in the arcade and the pressure of the nave roof, collapsed in 1751 and was again rebuilt almost immediately afterwards, but the arcade and aisle again failed to resist the thrust of the roof and in 1939 were heavily shored with timber until the work of restoration was undertaken. There have been several restorations. In 1879 the west window was renewed and other repairs executed, including work to the roofs of the nave and aisles, which were stripped and rebolted. The chancel roof, which had suffered severely from the ravages of the deathwatch beetle, was reconstructed in 1933. At the apex of the spire is a weather-vane. In the church itself there are five chapels currently in use. At the far east end of the church, there is a crypt chapel, which was rededicated to the honour of St Francis in 2004, above which is the Upper Chapel dedicated to St Alphege, and it is here that the Blessed Sacrament is reserved. At the Tower crossing, there is a chapel dedicated to St Katherine of Alexandria. on the north side of the nave is the chapel of St Thomas Becket, a successor to St Alphege, and on the south side is the Chapel of St Antony of Egypt. Music department St Alphege has an active music department, with choirs for boys, girls, ladies and men who sing services both separately and in various combinations. There are three sung services every Sunday, regular weekday Evensongs, and larger concerts on a monthly basis. In the past choristers from St Alphege have won Chorister of the Year and many go on to Choral Scholarships at cathedrals or 'Oxbridge' colleges. There are weekly recitals on Wednesdays which attract local and international players and frequent outreach projects with local schools. The church has a pipe organ dating from the seventeenth century. It has had substantial restoration work by Broxell Elliot, Edward James Bossward, Hill and Nicholson. The organ case by Thomas Swarbrick came from St Martin in the Bull Ring Birmingham around 1820. Some refurbishment of the organ took place in 2014 by Nicholson and Co. The work included a new console, and a stepper/sequencer was added.

The school caters for pupils aged 3 to 19 who are blind or partially sighted, and has facilities for children of nursery, primary and secondary age. Students attending the school come primarily from Scotland, but also from other parts of the United Kingdom. The school was divided into two campuses, both situated in Edinburgh. These were located in Canaan Lane and Craigmillar Park. The Craigmillar Park campus is for pupils who are blind and partially sighted, while the Canaan Lane campus caters for students with multiple disabilities. In August 2014, the two campuses combined into one and all of the children now attend the Canaan Lane campus. In March 1997, the school featured in a groundbreaking documentary for ITV as part of its Network First strand. A follow up programme, Blind School Christmas Special was shown in December of that year. History Founded in 1793 the School formed from an amalgam of different Edinburgh institutions. In 1825 it took on a residential element, caring for 25 blind women at a premises at 1 Hill Place. In 1876 the premises moved to a much larger, custom-built building, designed by Charles Leadbetter,Buildings of Scotland:Edinburgh, by Gifford McWilliam and Walker off Craigmillar Park in the south of the city, merging with the 1835 School for Blind Children. In 1929 the school and residential elements split, under the Chairmanship of Rev Dr Thomas Burns, creating a solely residential element, the Thomas Burns Home, on Alfred Place. In 1946 Oswald House was purchased to supplement the residential care provision. In 1979 the home was extended to provide for male residents. In 1991 a new home was opened on Canaan Lane and this was further supplemented in 1999 by Braeside House on Liberton Brae, aimed at the blind elderly and incorporating a sensory garden.

Biography  Datianus was the son of a servant in the public baths, and he climbed the social ladder to the position of senator in Constantinople and patricius of the Empire. He had some properties in Antioch, where he built public baths, some gardens and some villas. He also exchanged letters with Libanius, from whom he received, between 355 and 365, 20 letters still conserved. After serving under Emperor Constantine I, he became one of the main counsellors of his son Constantius II. As comes in 345, he wrote a letter to bishop Athanasius inviting him to return to his see in Alexandria, after being deposed by the Arians. In 351 was a member of the tribunal that put bishop Photinus on trial at the synod of Sirmium. In 354 he allowed Libanius to return to Antioch. In 358 he held the consulate, and he was still patricius as of 18 September of that year. After the death of Constantius and the rise to power of Julian (361-363), he lost influence. In 363, now elderly, he was in Antioch when Julian died. Datianus followed the new Emperor Jovian to Ancyra, where he passed the winter. When Jovian died in February 364, Datianus wrote from Galatia to Nicaea, where the imperial court was gathered, to support the election of Valentinian I. That same month (February 364), the population of Antioch burned his house, and the city council was accused of doing nothing to fight the fire. The people of Antioch sent Datianus a letter asking for his pardon, through the intercession of Libanius; when Datianus gave his pardon, the people were so happy that Libanius, who brought the news, increased his prestige. Datianus is recorded as still alive in 365.

As an amateur, he won a silver medal for Wales at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. As a professional, he has fought as a lightweight, and has won both the European and IBO championships at the weight. He currently campaigns at Light-Welterweight, and fights out of Fight Academy Wales gym in Llanharan, South Wales under the guidance of professional coach Darren Wilson. Amateur career Cook had a total of 86 amateur contests, winning 66. He won a silver medal in the featherweight (57 kg) class at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Cook's results were: *Defeated Francis Passingan (Papua New Guinea) points *Defeated Daniel Attah (Nigeria) points *Defeated Hassan Matumla (Tanzania) points *Lost to Casey Patton (Canada) points Professional career Cook's professional boxing career began in October 1996, with a second-round stoppage of Brian Robb, followed by further KO victories over Andrew Reed and David Kirk before being taken the distance on two occasions by Marc Smith. However, Cook then suffered a setback with a first-round knockout defeat at the hands of Trevor Smith. After the bout, Cook said \\"He clipped me with an overhand left and though I got up at six or seven, I was in no state to continue; the referee did the right thing.\\" After a nine-month lay-off, Cook returned to the ring to defeat Darren Woodley via a fourth-round knockout. Victories over journeymen David Hinds and Peter Buckley led to Cook receiving a shot at the vacant Welsh Area light welterweight title. On 11 December 1999, Cook won the vacant title with a first-round knockout of Woody Greenaway. Victories over Harry Butler, Andrei Sinepupov, Keith Jones, Assen Vassilev, and Dariusz Snarski followed, before a prison sentence momentarily ended Cook's boxing career. =Prison sentence= In 2001, Cook was found guilty of credit card fraud whilst working as a postman and was jailed for 15 months. Throughout his sentence, Cook kept himself in good shape and continued training on a punching bag that was supplied for him. Cook served a total of six months in prison with a further two months wearing an electronic tag. =Comeback and European title= Cook returned to the ring on 18 March 2002, with a knockout victory over Albanian boxer Fation Kacanolli. He followed this with point's victories over Russians Andrey Devyataykin and Viktor Baranov. On 23 July 2002, following the withdrawal of Bobby Vanzie, Cook was offered the chance to fight Sandro Casamonica in Italy for the vacant European lightweight title. Ten days later, on 2 August 2002, Cook produced an upset by defeating Casamonica via a third-round knockout. Cook had started well winning the opening two rounds but was floored in the 3rd. As Casamonica moved in to finish the fight, he was hit with a left hook that brought an end the fight. After the bout a jubilant Cook said \\"It’s like a dream; my life has changed, it still hasn’t sunk in. That was the best punch I’ve thrown in my life, and it came when I most needed it. I’m ecstatic; I’m walking around on a cloud.\\" Cook's first defence of the title was against Frenchman Nasser Lakrib on 26 October 2002. Lakrib was stopped in the 5th round, in a fight which was held in Cook's hometown of Maesteg. Cook's next defence of the title was against Stefano Zoff, who he went on to defeat via a split point's decision. Despite the victory, Cook lost his European title before the bout when he failed to make the 135 lb lightweight limit. =IBO title= On 8 November 2003, Cook fought Argentinian Ariel Olveira for the vacant IBO lightweight title. Cook defeated Olveira by a 7th-round stoppage, after the Argentine's cornerman threw in the towel. Cook's first defence of the title was against reigning commonwealth champion Kevin Bennett on 1 May 2004. Cook outboxed Bennett to claim a close but unanimous points decision. On 5 November 2004, Cook was scheduled to face South African Phillip Ndou in defence of his IBO title. However, on 21 October 2004, Ndou retired suddenly after a brain scan revealed a slight abnormality. Ndou had previously challenged Floyd Mayweather Jr. for the WBC lightweight title. A disappointed Cook said of the proposed bout \\"It would have been a great fight, I was thinking it could have been the British version of Hagler-Hearns. I might have had to pick myself off the canvas in that one but I'd have definitely come back and eventually prevailed.\\" The late replacement for Ndou was Argentinian Aldo Rios, who went on to stop Cook in the 3rd round. Cook had started the fight well but was floored in the 3rd by a straight right hand, and a follow up attack from Rios forced referee Richard Davies to stop the contest. Following the bout Cook said \\"I took things a bit easy and got caught cold more than anything...This may have been a step too far, but I'll be back.\\" Rios had previously lost to Ricky Hatton by knockout in a challenge for the WBU light welterweight title. =Retirement= On 25 November 2005, over a year after his last fight, Cook returned to the ring to face Gary Reid. Cook won the bout via disqualification after he was hit with a low blow and could not continue. In September, 2006, after pulling out of a fight with Giuseppe Lauri for the vacant European light welterweight title, Cook announced his retirement from boxing. On his decision Cook said \\"It's time for me to go now. I've had so much trouble with the shoulder over the years and tendonitis in an ankle which flares up when I do roadwork that I can't carry on at the top level. If I was going to fight four, or six- rounders, it might be OK, but life as a journeyman is not for me.\\" =Return with Prizefighter= On 20 October it was announced that Cook would be returning to the ring as part of Sky Sports Prizefighter series. The Competition will be held at light-welterweight. Also involved in the competition is fellow Welshman and former world champion Gavin Rees, a fighter from Enzo Calzaghe's boxing stable. Cook won his first round fight against Michael Grant, as the referee decided to stop the contest on the Doctors orders after Grant suffered a nasty cut. In the Semi-Final stage, Cook lost to Gavin Rees by a unanimoius points decision, with Rees declaring that he was expecting the Final fight against Colin Lynes to be an easyer fight than his Semi-Final against Cook. The brave comeback performance by Cook earned him a shot at the British Light-Welterweight Title against Lenny Dawes =British Title Shot= Jason Cook challenged Lenny Dawes for the British Light- Welterweight Title on 12 February 2010 at York Hall, Bethnal Green in London. From the opening bell, Cook looked comfortable and slick and dominated the early rounds. Cook had Dawes visibly hurt in the 1st round, forcing Dawes to hold on to the Maesteg boxer to spare further punishment. After building up an early lead on the judges’ scorecards and cutting Dawes, Cook began to tire and Dawes came back into the fight, having Cook in trouble in the 11th and 12th rounds. One judge awarded it 115-114 to Cook; one awarded it 115-114 to Dawes, with the other scoring it 114-114. The bout was declared a draw and Dawes regained his title.

Its performers included 125 ballet dancers, 100 circus people, 1,750 supernumeraries and students, 200 women, 260 secondary actors, and 150 assistants. There were also tanks and armoured cars involved. The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary Symbolist utopias of \\"ritual theatre\\" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution), and recast their \\"people\\" as the proletariat.Kleberg (1980, 44-64). Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators, the action begins with the February Revolution, follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a red stage to the left, with Kerensky and the Provisional Government on a white stage to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying \\"Lenin, Lenin\\" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the \\"Whites.\\" Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the cruiser Aurora and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. Influence Evreinov's dramatic creation was extremely influential in the commemoration of the deposition of the Provisional Government, which in reality took place at night and was much less dramatic than depicted either in Evreinov's spectacle or in Sergei Eisenstein's feature film October: Ten Days That Shook the World (1927). One of the over 100 surviving photographs from the spectacle, pictured above, was presented from 1922 on in many Soviet and also foreign publications as an authentic image from the events of 1917. For this purpose, the picture was heavily retouched, with the spectators on the right and a tower-like construction for directing the participants removed.Sylvia Sasse: Retusche=Attacke. Oder: Wie Geschichte durch Theater repariert wurde. Kulturstiftung des Bundes. Das Magazin #28. 2017/2. The image is sometimes also misinterpreted as a film still from October, though the \\"storming\\" in the film is set (historically correctly) at night, not during the day as in the photograph.

Early career Van der Lijn was born in Alkmaar, possibly in 1608. He went, in 1627, as Assistant () to Batavia, Dutch East Indies aboard the Wapen van Hoorn. From 1632 to 18 January 1636 he was Accountant-General (). In 1639 he became Counsellor-Extraordinary () to the . A year later he was appointed President of the Schepenrechtbank (a maritime court, but with various other functions). One further year later he was made a full Counsellor () he followed Philips Lucasz (whose portrait was painted by Rembrandt) as Director-General of the Indies. Council of the Indies Shortly before his death on 19 April 1645, Governor-General Antonio van Diemen called upon the Dutch Council of the Indies (12 April 1645) to establish Cornelis van der Lijn as his successor. This was not in line with the instructions of the (Heren XVII), who has laid down in 1617 that immediately after the death of a Governor-General, the Council should choose a provisional Governor-General. Only once the Seventeen Lords had agreed to the choice would the appointment come into actual force. The Heren XVII at first cancelled Van Diemen's decision, but then afterwards named the very same Cornelis van der Lijn as his successor. On 10 October 1646 he was named by them as Governor- General. Cornelis van der Lijn was not a strong ruler. He built a little on what his predecessor Van Diemen had established, but did not go much further. He signed peace treaties with Solor, Bantam and Mataram. Moreover, on 24 September 1646 he signed a (largely trade) agreement with the Prince of Mataram, the first of such contracts signed by the Dutch with Javanese rulers. Strenuous measures were taken to maintain the monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the Moluccas. After a fierce struggle, the fortress at Kapaha on Thitu Island (Hitu) was taken. The severe regulations would soon lead to riots. The rulers in the Netherlands allowed Van der Lijn, at his own request, to retire with honour on 7 October 1650. Carel Reyniersz was then named as Governor-General. In 1651, Cornelis van der Lijn left aboard the Prinses Royaal for the Netherlands. His reception in the homeland was as cool as his departure from the Indies. The customary reception and congratulations given to a returning fleet and its commander were denied to him. Mayor of Alkmaar He established himself in Alkmaar where he was elected Mayor () on 24 December 1668. He died there on 27 July 1679.

After working in 14 games for Milwaukee in brief trials in and , his contract was sold to the expansion Mets on October 11, 1961, one day after that year's expansion draft. An original Met, MacKenzie posted a 5–4 record and was the only man among 17 pitchers on the Mets to win more games than he lost on a team that suffered 120 defeats. Manager Casey Stengel said of him: \\"He's a splendid young fella with a great education from Yale University. His signing with us makes him the lowest paid member of the class of Yale '56.\\" In , MacKenzie again was the Mets' lone over-.500 pitcher, winning three of four decisions for a team that would lose 111 games. MacKenzie, however, was traded to the pennant-contending St. Louis Cardinals on August 5, 1963. His Met totals: eight wins, five losses, and four saves, with a 4.96 earned run average over 76 games pitched. His eight victories as a Met would be his only ones in Major League Baseball. He bounced from the Cardinals to the Giants to the Astros through the campaign, spending time in Triple-A in the process. All told he won eight of 18 MLB decisions in 129 games pitched (all but one as a reliever), with five career saves. In 208 innings pitched, he allowed 231 hits and 63 bases on balls, with 142 strikeouts.

Claverham Community College is a mixed comprehensive school for pupils aged 11–16 and a Community College. It has approximately 1150 pupils and about 2500 associates of the College who are involved in the life of the College Community either through adult evening classes or as a result of membership of affiliated societies. The Community College was established in 1973 and was developed from the former Battle County Secondary School built in 1955. In school terms the College became fully comprehensive in 1976 and now serves the educational needs of all children between the ages of 11 and 16 in Battle and the neighbouring villages of Ashburnham, Catsfield, Crowhurst, Hooe (north), Netherfield, Ninfield, Penhurst, Sedlescombe, Whatlington and Westfield. In addition to this traditional intake area, the College attracts pupils in relatively large numbers from an additional 40 primary schools in the Rye, Hastings, Bexhill, Pevensey and Eastbourne areas in particular. Claverham was designated as a training school in September 2000 and achieved Specialist Sports College Status, with ICT as the second specialism, with effect from September 2006. This status later revoked in early 2018 when funding was lost due to not enough hours of extracurricular clubs and a lack of individual pupils acting as sports representatives for the College at events. The school also achieved an \\"Outstanding\\" from Ofsted in its last two inspections, although this year it has dropped to a 'good', mostly as a result of a change in staff and a lack of government funding. History The college takes its title from the Anglo- Saxon pre-conquest description of the particular area in which it is situated - place of clover or good pasture. The college opened in 1955 and has been fortunate in having enjoyed considerable stability in that up to the time of the appointment of the present Principal (2008) there had been only four changes of leadership since that time with each one having made his own unique contribution to the development of the college. Robert Davies (1955-1958) gave the school a firm foundation. Peter Court (1958-1980) is most associated with the establishment of the school as one of three community colleges in East Sussex (the others being Portslade and Uplands, Wadhurst). The philosophy underpinning this concept was that a school should act as a focal point for its community opening its facilities to the general public during evenings and weekends. A wide range of adult education courses and activities was established as well as a youth centre housed in separate premises in the town. Christopher Thompson (1980-1992) built on the community provision with the establishment of the Battle Area Sports Centre and the Claverham Day Nursery while at the same time making a wide range of radical changes to the pastoral and academic organisation of the college, in particular by abandoning mixed ability teaching groups and replacing these with the setting of pupils by ability by subject throughout the academic subject range. This was also accompanied by the introduction of criteria based twice termly pupil assessments, the close monitoring of pupils and staff in regard to the setting, completion and marking of homework and careful oversight of lesson preparation and teaching standards. In regard to pastoral care, a fully fledged vertical house system was developed. When first opened, there were originally four houses. Mountjoy, Middleborough, Sandlach, and Telham - the names of the houses being derived from post conquest place names given by the Normans to areas of the battleground which had been significant in the action. However, originally, these house groupings did not form the core of the pastoral system which was, instead, based upon a horizontal year system. In 1981 the name Middleborough was replaced by that of Caldbec, and the houses became the key part of the pastoral care provision, replacing the existing horizontal year structure with a 'family' vertical structure where all staff and pupils shared loyalties to organisations within the college as well as to the college as a whole. The College Houses, each represented by a different colour and with all girls and boys wearing house ties incorporating their particular house colour alongside the blue and yellow College stripes - Caldbec purple, Montjoie blue, Santlache red, Telham green and then, in 2008, Oakwood silver, when this additional house was introduced. These changes in academic and pastoral organisation facilitated the development of a strong ethos of high expectations in regard to all aspects of the life of the College - in particular, high standards of pastoral care, pupil discipline and attainment. Richard Pitts (1992-2008) greatly further consolidated the ethos of the college while overseeing considerable building developments including four new laboratories and classrooms, and further expansion of pupil numbers as the reputation of the college continued to grow. Starting from the first Christmas, the school started using the Vivo Miles system replacing the old merit system. As of 2017, the Vivo Miles and Show My Homework systems were replaced with the new Class Charts system. Campus The college is located about one mile west of the market town of Battle and is situated within 42 acres of wood and parkland. The College grounds incorporate land which belonged formerly to the Battle Abbey Estate and are immediately adjacent to the site of the Battle of Hastings. As might be expected, the geographical position is an elevated one within sight of the sea. Curriculum Claverham Community College offers many courses to its students.http://www.claverham.e-sussex.sch.uk/students/year-9-options/ Below are the subjects available at Key Stage 3: English, Maths, Science (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), French, Spanish, German, ICT, Food Technology, Product Design, Music, History, Religious Studies, Geography, Classics (Year 7-8), Latin (Top 2 Sets Year 8 and optional in Year 9), Art and Physical Education. At GCSE, students are required to take the following courses: English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, Science and Religious Studies. In addition, most students will be given a language to take during their GCSEs as well as the option to take another. Students are then available to choose several of these optional GCSEs: French, Spanish, German, ICT, Media Studies, Food Technology, Product Design, Drama, Music, History, Geography, Latin, Physical Education, Dance, Art, Art Graphics and Textiles. The college also offers the following vocational courses: Hospitality, Travel & Tourism, Land & Environment and Health & Social Care. The college now offers the chance for pupils to take a Diploma worth four GCSEs instead of sitting ten GCSEs. The Diploma courses are for: ICT, Sports and Environmental & Land base studies. Note: some students have the option of taking Science Btec for GCSE which gives them two GCSE qualifications, worth either A*-C without taking and exam. Sports and traditions The college as a designated Specialist Sports College has many modern sporting facilities including full access to the local Battle Sports Centre, with a full indoor sports hall, dance studio and fitness suite. It also has outdoor football and rugby pitches and tennis courts. It also has an indoor gym which features a climbing wall. House and prefect system At Claverham the house which a student belongs to can easily be identified through the colour of their tie; where the college operates around a five house system. In year eleven, approximately 10% of the year - 20 from each house, are chosen as college prefects. As a reward for performing duties around the school, they are entitled to wear a college prefect tie and house badge (as the prefect tie does not distinguish between houses). There are no prefect rooms for use at break and lunch like there used to be. The college awards the following titles to prefects: *Head Boy3 *Head Girl3 *Deputy Head Boy3 *Deputy Head Girl3 *Head Boy of House *Head Girl of House *Deputy Head Boy of House *Deputy Head Girl of House *Senior Prefect *Prefect *Music Prefect *Sports Prefect2,5,6 *Travel Prefect2,4 1Oakwood Seniors are house prefects chosen to cover the vacuum of prefects created by the addition of the fifth house. 2Do not receive benefits listed above, Are not included in quota. 3Chosen from the Head Boy/Girl of each house. 4Now identified by Lozenge badge rather than shield badge 5White shield badge, does not distinguish between houses 6These are Year Ten pupils unlike most other Prefect Roles Heads and Deputy Heads of the college wear a Yellow badge in addition to their house badge(s).

KLNLF emerged from the United People's Democratic Solidarity, being the anti-peace talks faction of UDPS. After the split, there has been turf wars between the two groups. In July 2008, the Assam government estimated that KLNLF had a membership of 225.DailyExcelsior. KLNLF is closely linked to the United Liberation Front of Asom. 6 December is the foundation day of KLNLF. Objectives The outfit claims to fight for the cause of Karbi tribes and its declared objective is Hemprek Kangthim, meaning self-rule/self- determination of the Karbi people. Leadership, cadre and area of operation Pradip Terang alias Pongbi Dilli is the ‘Chairman’ of the outfit. Har Sing Timung was the General Secretary till 2 January 2005, when he resigned from his position following serious differences with the ‘Commander-in-Chief’ Men Sing Takbi alias Willingson Timung. Laden Ronghang is the ‘Publicity Secretary’ of the group and ‘Incharge Central Publicity Cell’ is Thong Teron alias Rupsing Teron. The Assistant Foreign Secretary/ Revenue/Finance/Taxation of the outfit is Biren Lekthe alias Risso Tokbi. Currently, the outfit has around 200 cadres operating in the Karbi Anglong district.

Later on 29 April 2005, Hor Sing Timung along with other four associates was executed by the outfit at a camp in Bangladesh for their involvement in the murder of Timung. While the group’s stronghold is the Karbi Anglong district, its presence has also been reported from Dima Hasao and Nagaon districts. Linkage The outfit maintains close links with the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). The ULFA’s ‘709th battalion’ operates out of two major bases in Karbi Anglong, with the KLNLF providing it with logistic support in return for weapons and ammunition. It also reportedly has links with the Nagaland- based National Socialist Council of Nagaland - Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). On 11 May 2004, 31 KLNLF cadres along with five NSCN-IM militants were arrested from a bus on the Paren-Ghaspani Road on their way to Dimapur. These cadres had undergone training at a NSCN-IM camp and were reportedly part of the recent batch that passed out from there. On 13 October 2007, security forces neutralized a joint camp of the NSCN-IM and KLNLF inside Kaki Reserve Forest area in the Karbi Anglong district. Funds Abductions for ransom and extortion are the main sources of funds for the group. According to official sources, the outfit generates a considerable amount of revenue by targeting the ginger producing Kukis in the Singhason Hills area. The non-Karbi Hindi – speaking traders are also targeted for extortion. In some case, even the Karbis are targeted for extortion.

For many years he was keeper of entomology at the British Museum. His first schooling took place at Dulwich College where his interest in natural history and Lepidoptera became evident. Richard South, the prominent entomologist was the Riley family's neighbour in Balham and encouraged Norman Riley in his hobby. After he finishing school Riley enrolled at the Imperial College in order to take a course in entomology, and managed to find work there as a demonstrator under Ray Lankester, who was then director of the British Museum. At age 21 he was appointed as an assistant in the Entomology Department. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Riley joined the Royal Army Service Corps, and saw service in France. At the end of the war he was discharged with the rank of captain and resumed his work at the museum, becoming keeper of entomology in 1932. He became dedicated to acquiring gifts and purchases of specimens to expand the collection of the museum, and succeeded in creating a research resource of international renown. Because of his easy and affable manner, Riley became popular as a committee- man and competently steered projects through financial and political pitfalls, becoming involved in national and international entomological matters. He served as both secretary and treasurer to the Entomological Society of London between 1926 and 1951, and was elected president in 1952. He was also a charter member of the Lepidopterists' Society and served on their council, being elected vice-president in 1954 and president in 1958. He also found time to be active in the Zoological Society of London. In 1923, on the retirement of Richard South, his boyhood mentor, Riley took over the running of a small, but popular periodical called the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine.Obituary by Lionel Higgins Works *1944 Some British Moths - Norman Denbigh Riley *1964 The Department of Entomology of the British Museum, 1904-1964 - Norman Denbigh Riley *1970 Butterflies and Moths - Alfred Werner, Josef Bijok edited by Norman Denbigh Riley, New York Studio/The Viking Press *1975 A Field Guide to the Butterflies of the West Indies - Norman D.

Though a regular cricketer for a dozen years, he was frequently in poor health because of damage to his lungs during the First World War and he died at the age of 45, less than three years after his most successful cricket season. Early cricket career Young, a right-handed batsman often used as an opener and a right-arm slow spin bowler, was born at Bathwick in Bath on 6 November 1890, and first appeared for Somerset in three matches in 1911, making little impact. He reappeared again in two matches in 1919, again to no great effect. In 1921, however, he was given 10 matches and made useful runs, including his first score of more than 50, an unbeaten 69 in the match against Essex at Southend, when he also took wickets that helped to win the game. County regular From 1922 to 1933, Young was a regular member of the Somerset side. He was, says a history of Somerset cricket, \\"a laconic and frail man\\", yet despite the damage done to his lungs in France during the First World War he missed very few games over the 12 seasons. Initially, he played largely as a batsman, usually opening. In 1922, he made 881 runs, and in every other season he went on to more than 900 runs, passing the 1,000 runs for the season five times. His first century came in 1923 against a weak Glamorgan side at Taunton, when he put on 251 for the second wicket with Jack MacBryan, who made 148. A year later, he made 198 against Hampshire at Bath, the major contribution in what was, at that stage, Somerset's highest-ever first-class total. The innings remained Young's highest score in first-class cricket. He was picked twice to represent the professionals in Gentlemen v Players matches, once at Folkestone and once at The Oval. All-rounder Up to 1930, Young was regarded as primarily a batsman who bowled a bit. This was, says Somerset's cricket history, \\"an astonishing oversight\\" by successive captains, John Daniell and Jack White. But in 1930 his bowling was finally discovered: he took 66 wickets in County Championship matches alone at an average of 18 apiece, and 71 wickets in all. This was, wrote Wisden, \\"a truly remarkable improvement upon what he had previously accomplished in that department of the game\\". Against Derbyshire at Taunton in August 1930, he made scores of 63 and 70 as an opening batsman, and then took three for 47 and eight for 30 to finish with match figures of 11 for 77. After Young had taken five for 70 in the match against the Australian touring team, including the wickets of Donald Bradman, Archie Jackson, Stan McCabe and Vic Richardson, Bradman is reported to have remarked: \\"What a good off-spinner he is.\\" Bradman and Jackson had both scored centuries before Young took their wickets, though. Young was awarded a benefit match in the 1930 season, and picked the game against Sussex at Bath: rain interfered badly with play on the Saturday, delayed the resumption on Monday until mid-afternoon, and then prevented any play at all on the Tuesday. The gate receipts were £62 and the match yielded him only £100 in total, but further collections across the summer boosted the benefit fund to £750. Though by now over 40 years old, Young sustained both his batting and his bowling performance across 1931 and 1932, and in 1933 had his best all-round season, with 951 runs which included three centuries for the first time in any season and 90 wickets. He took 10 wickets in a match for the second time in his career in the game against Worcestershire at Stourbridge. Along with Arthur Wellard, Wisden said, Young \\"formed the backbone of the team\\" in 1933. End of career and death But that was that. The 1935 Wisden reported on Young's absence as a factor in a weaker Somerset team in the 1934 season, and noted that he had been added to the list of first-class umpires for the 1935 season. The 1936 Wisden said that, \\"owing to illness\\", Young had not stood as an umpire in any first-class matches in 1935 and had withdrawn from the umpires list for 1936. In fact, Young died at his home in Bath on 2 April 1936 just before the cricket season started. He was 45. Character Illness is cited in Somerset's history as a potential reason why Young was seen as a \\"moody and intimidating\\" cricketer by his fellow players. Younger left-arm spinner Horace Hazell is quoted as saying: \\"I admired him – he was good for us. Tom was very strict and didn't approve of us signing autographs outside the Oval. He didn't want us getting big ideas too quickly.\\" All-rounder Bill Andrews is reported as having asked Young why, after making 32 opening the innings against Larwood and Voce in a match against Nottinghamshire, he had kept his pads on. Young allegedly replied: \\"Waste of time taking 'em off, son. We'll be soon bloody well in again.\\" External links Tom Young at www.cricketarchive.com References . 1890 births 1936 deaths English cricketers Somerset cricketers Sportspeople from Bath, Somerset Players cricketers English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 ","title":"Tom Young (cricketer)"},{"id":"20584019","text":"The Pilot Show is a British TV comedy show written and created by Paul Garner.

Both societies associate their origins with the founder, Shen Dunhe, a tea merchant. History =Origin= On 3 March 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Shen Dunhe created the \\"Manchuria Red Cross Benevolent Society\\" and on 10 March 1904, the society was renamed the \\"Shanghai International Red Cross Committee\\". Its founders were Chinese business and political leaders and expatriates from the West. Shen chose the aegis of the Red Cross because its neutrality allowed aid to reach those Chinese civilians caught between Japanese and Russian forces in Manchuria.Yannan L. L. \\"Red Cross Society in Imperial China, 1904-1912.\\" The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. Accessed 26 December 2013. =Expansion= After the Russo-Japanese War, the society expanded and its mission to aid those affected by war and disaster continued. The society opened Red Cross hospitals in Shanghai and other cities. Local Red Cross chapters were popular because the association represented international connections, modernity and its activities were seen as patriotic. For example, the society sent workers to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and workers, medicines and funds were sent to Japan after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. In 1920, there were over 300 Red Cross chapters in China. =Recognition= In 1912, the ICRC recognised the national society of the then Republic of China. In 1919, the society joined the International Federation as one of its first members. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, the society held ties with American and British Red Cross, the Kuomintang government and the Shanghai business community. In 1933, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Act of Administrative Rules and Procedures of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China () was passed. The society was renamed the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China.\\"Tracing offices of recognized Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies.\\" ICRC 28 September 2009. The society's activities during the war time period (1937 - 1945) were limited to Kuomintang held areas in southwest China and to some areas under Japanese control. Supplies were received through Burma and India from the United States and the United Kingdom. Expatriate Chinese also raised funds. =Relocation to Taiwan= After 1950, when the major hostilities of the Chinese civil war had ended, the society moved its headquarters to Taiwan. In 1955, the government of the Republic of China declared the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China the sole national humanitarian organization of the country and wrote this in legislation. The act clarified the role of the society in the case of invasion by the forces of the Communist Party of China and in caring for wounded Taiwanese soldiers and prisoners of war. Fiscal exemptions for society volunteers were approved. The organization was tasked with provision of basic sanitation and hygiene to the most impoverished; and, with teaching first aid to adults and children. =International recognition= The society meets most of the conditions laid out in Article 4 of the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of 1995, except that Taiwan is not a signatory to the Geneva Conventions.\\"Conditions for recognition of national societies.\\" ICRC 29 July 2005.

Each MicroAngelo board produced a 512 by 480 pixel monochrome image, high resolution for the era.Most home computers of the era displayed 256 to 320 by 192 to 240, while the Cromemco Dazzler for S-100 machines produced only 128 by 128. The MicroAngelo Palette (or Colour Mixing) Card used the output of multiple MicroAngelo's as individual bit-planes to produce images with up to 256 colors (using 8 cards). Early versions of AutoCAD supported the MicroAngelo system.John Walker, \\"AutoCAD-80 Development Log\\" The original MA512 board included 32 kB of RAM for the frame buffer, a Z80 processor operating as a controller and memory refresh driver, and 4 kB of ROM containing one of two optional sets of subroutines.SCION, pg. 7 Users programmed the MicroAngelo in assembly language using the Z80's input/output parallel ports, which sent data over the internal S-100 bus at relatively high speeds. The data sent over the bus was examined by the Z80 on the card, which then ran a selected subroutine contained in its ROM to place data into the frame buffer. The screen buffer could be moved to or from the computer's main memory - useful for printing when pushed from the card to the computer, or displaying bitmap graphics when reversed. The 4 kB ROM normally contained \\"Screenware Pak I\\", which provided routines to emulate an 85 by 40 line character screen, which also allowed the user to define their own 12 by 6 pixel character sets in the card's RAM. The optional 6 kB \\"Screenware Pak II\\" (in 8 kV of ROM) was a superset of Pak I, adding circle, line and polygon drawing routines, flood fill and a variety of other features.Byte, pg.5 Pak II also added a \\"split screen\\" function, allowing a portion of the screen to be placed in graphics mode and the rest in text mode, which some considered a necessity.Beebe The MA512 had a number of problems that were addressed in the later MA520, released in 1982. In particular, the software interface required only two of the input/output \\"ports\\", but a single MA512 would lock down an entire set of eight, typically F0 to FF. This made expanding a system with a complete set of eight MicroAngelo boards difficult, because the eight cards and the associated palette card would end up using up the vast majority of 256 available ports. The MA520 locked down only the two ports it actually used. The MA520 also used 64 kB DRAMs and 2732 EPROMs to reduce chip counts and expand the frame buffer to 64 kB. Although the video system could only see one bank of 32 kB, the other 32 kB could be used for a variety of purposes, including scratch buffers and storing routines.Carl Machover and John Dill, \\"Product Highlights\\", IEEE CG&A;, March/April 1983, pp. 90-91 MicroAngelo also supported a light pen, connected through input terminals on the top of the card. The Screenware software automatically converted the coordinates into the card's coordinates. Screenware also included routines for drawing movable cursors in hardware (as opposed to bit block transferring), and the cursor could be made to follow the light pen simply by reading the pen coordinates and feeding them into the cursor. Shortly after the MA520 was announced, SCION stated they were going to produce a standalone terminal consisting of a complete Zilog Z80-based CP/M machine packaged with a MA520, and optionally a monitor as well. Known as the Mirage 1, a version with a color monitor (and Palette Card) would be known as the Mirage 2.\\"Scion's Mirage 1 stand-alone graphics computer/terminal\\", InfoWorld, 1 November 1982, pg. 10 However, there is no record of either version having shipped. Form and Function packaged a graphics terminal using a single MicroAngelo board placed inside an existing Ball monochrome monitor to produce the \\"IM-1\\". The IM-1 connected to any computer using a serial port, data being passed along to the cards. The system could be upgraded to greyscale by adding additional cards, and to color by swapping the screen. This solution had a number of problems, including the fact that it did not support existing terminal standards like VT52, and that the serial port would start to bog down above about 6000 bit/s, slow even for the era.

He served in a range of capacities as a parish priest before establishing both religious orders in order to spread devotion to the Holy Family to whom he fostered an intense devotion. The sainthood cause commenced under Pope Pius XII on 25 November 1956 - in which he was titled as a Servant of God - while Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable in 1982. The same pope beatified him on his trip to Paris in 1984 and later canonized him as a saint in mid-2004 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Josep Manyanet i Vives was born in Tremp in 1833. His baptism was celebrated on the date of his birth. His father died while he was an infant in September 1834. In 1888 his mother offered him up to the Madonna as a special consecration and the parish priest Valentín Lledós helped him cultivate his religious calling. He received his education with the Piarists in Barbastro and then went on to be trained in the seminaries at Lleida and La Seu d'Urgell. He was ordained to the priesthood on 9 April 1859 and went on to become the aide of the Bishop of Urgel Josep Caixal Estradé. Other tasks he had been assigned to included being the librarian at one of the seminaries. On 28 June 1864 he founded a male religious order and followed that up on 19 March 1874 with a female branch. The male order received diocesan approval on 3 February 1894 and then the papal approval of Pope Pius XII well after his death on 16 December 1950 while the female order received the decree of praise from Pope Leo XIII on 30 April 1887 and papal approval from him on 22 June 1901 not long before the priest died. He worked for the construction of a church in Barcelona that the noted architect Servant of God Antoni Gaudí built. He also founded a school in Barcelona in 1895. He was subjected to prolonged illnesses during his life which included open sores on his side that he had labelled \\"God's mercies\\" for well over a decade. He died on 17 December 1901 at the school he established in Barcelona; his last words were: \\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph, may I breathe forth my soul in peace with you. His remains are kept in a burial chapel at the same school where he died. In 2005 there were 193 religious - 136 of them priests - in a total of 43 houses worldwide in places such as Brazil and Mexico. Sainthood The beatification cause commenced in Barcelona in 1931 in an informative process that Archbishop Manuel Irurita i Almándoz inaugurated and later concluded while all his spiritual writings received theological approval on 22 November 1939. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Pius XII on 25 November 1956 and he was titled as a Servant of God as a subsequent result; the Congregation for Rites validated the informative process in Rome on 20 May 1967. The officials from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and their consultants approved the cause on 10 February 1982 while the C.C.S. later met themselves to approve it as well on 22 June 1982. The late priest was named as Venerable on 12 July 1982 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that he had indeed lived a model life of heroic virtue. The process for a miracle needed for beatification opened in Barcelona in a diocesan process that Cardinal Narcís Jubany Arnau oversaw from July 1981 until October 1981 while the C.C.S. validated this process on 29 October 1982. A medical board approved it on 27 January 1984 as did the theologians consulting them on 26 April 1984 and the C.C.S. on 22 May 1984. John Paul II approved this on 9 June 1984 and beatified the priest on his visit to Paris in France on 25 November 1984. The miracle involved the cure of Mrs. Francisca Trías Iglesias from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage on 15 October 1960. The second miracle - the one for sainthood - was investigated in a diocesan process in Medellín that Archbishop Alberto Giraldo Jaramillo opened and closed in 1997 while it later received validation on 6 February 1998. A medical board approved it on 6 March 2003 as did the theologians on 17 June 2003 and the C.C.S. on 16 December 2003. John Paul II approved this miracle on 20 December 2003 and canonized him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 May 2004 in Saint Peter's Square. The miracle was the healing of Sister Manuela Burbano Ortiz - from his women's order - from comedocarcinoma infiltrating the right breast in a clinic in Colombia on 28 January 1995.

In the moment of the reproduction, one of these keys will decrypt the MKB contained on the disc and as a result of this process we obtain the Media key. The Media key is combined together with the VID (Volume ID) and as a result we obtain the Volume Unique Key (Kvu). With the Kvu we are able to decrypt the Encrypted Title Key and obtain the Title keys which finally allows to decrypt the content of the disc and view it. This way the system can protect contents from being viewed in devices that have not been authorized. Therefore, the system allows modifying the MKB in future relaunch of a determined content in order to select the devices in which this content can be viewed.  Key structure  Media Key Block structure Even though it seems a simple mechanism the MKB key which is found in the physical support of the disc follows a complex structure. The MKB is distributed in blocks that contain the version of the Media key, the list of devices that have been revoked, a field to authenticate the MKB, and other fields that specify parameters corresponding to the decrypting algorithm and define the structure of the own Media Key and also the Media key itself. The MKB itself is found inside the field Media Key Data Record and has a variable length but it is always a multiple of 4 bytes.  Advantages and disadvantages  Many consumer associations have complained against this protection system since it can lead to a situation where physical devices cannot reproduce contents even though they do not infringe any intellectual property. This situation can be achieved either by trying to reproduce some content in old devices, therefore not certified by the AACS, or because the device model has been disallowed by AACS, as a result all the owners of that device model will not be able to view contents protected with the MKB. This situation has become even worse with the recent publication in multiple web sites of the Media Key, that is, the key that allows decrypting the Volume ID and at the same time, the encrypted content, without the need of using a certified device by the AACS or a valid MKB. This is especially critical because nowadays the Volume ID is the same in all the Blu-ray or HD-DVDs with equal content.

Synopsis = Background = The television series Cheers follows the fortunes and inter-relationships of a group of Bostonians who meet regularly at \\"Cheers\\", their local bar. Sam Malone (Ted Danson), a ladies' man, former professional baseball player, and bartender, and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), a college graduate student, and cocktail waitress, had on-and-off relationships throughout the first five seasons of the program (1982–1987) until Diane left Boston to pursue a writing career in the season five finale, \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (1987). This was Shelley Long's last contracted appearance as Diane Chambers. Six years after the season five finale, the Sam and Diane storyline is resurrected with a special guest appearance by Shelley Long and then concluded in the final episode. During season eleven there are many transformations before the finale. Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), another bartender at Cheers, is married to socialite Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), expecting a child with her, and has been running to be a councilmember of the Boston City Council. The waitress Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) has gone through two husbands—her first marriage ended with divorce before the series began, and she became widowed in her second—and is a single mother of eight. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) face marital problems, including Lilith's affair with another man. After her failed relationships with rich men in the past, the bar manager Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) and the plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger) start dating each other in the preceding episode, \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\" (1993). Meanwhile in that episode, Sam faces up to his sexual addiction and begins to attend group therapy. Norm Peterson (George Wendt) is still semi-unemployed. Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) is still a postal carrier living with his mother.

Rebecca accidentally rejects Don Santry's (Tom Berenger)Tom Berenger's character Don Santry first appeared in the previous episode, \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\". proposal because she is too excited to accept it, causing him to break up with her. Diane Chambers, making her first appearance on the series after six years, appears on television, accepting an award for outstanding writing of a television movie, surprising Sam, who struggles with his sex addiction since the previous episode, \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\". Diane calls Sam at night to thank him for the congratulatory telegram he sent earlier. Diane accepts Sam's invitation to return to Boston, but Sam doubts that she will actually come. The following day, Diane arrives with her \\"husband\\" Reed (Mark Harelik), surprising Sam, who eventually uses Rebecca, who is grieving over her breakup, as his pretend wife. At Melville's restaurant, when Don enters and re-proposes, Rebecca finally accepts, ruining Sam's charade. Then Reed's partner Kevin (Anthony Heald) arrives to confront him for \\"cheating\\" with Diane. Now alone at the table, Diane admits to Sam that she broke her promise to return to him after six months in the episode \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (1987). Indeed, she had to convert her rejected finished manuscript into a screenplay, prompting her to remain in Los Angeles for six years for greater success. Then Sam and Diane both admit having been incompatible together and having no family of their own. When Diane bids Sam farewell, he stops her from leaving and convinces her to restart their relationship for old times' sake. Another following day, Woody, now elected city councilman, gives Norm a job with the city. Rebecca marries Don but secretly regrets it, feeling he is too good for her. Cliff is promoted to postal assistant supervisor after bribing the head of the postal department with gifts. Sam and Diane walk in and announce their engagement. His friends disapprove; however, having enough of going years without a family, Sam leaves the bar with Diane. On the plane, they begin to reconsider their decision to be together again. As the flight is delayed, they amicably agree to part ways. Diane returns to Los Angeles, and Sam returns to Cheers to see his friends again. While Sam and his gang celebrate the reunion, Rebecca announces happily that Don has a job with the sewer department and leaves for their honeymoon. After the rest of the gang head home for the night, Norm briefly stays behind and tells Sam that he knew he would return to Boston for his \\"one true love.\\" Sam asks what he means, but Norm just smiles and says, \\"you'll always come back to her.\\" After Norm leaves, Sam looks around the bar and says to himself, \\"I'm the luckiest son of a bitch in the world,\\" before he tells someone (Bob Broder) knocking on the door, \\"Sorry, we're closed.\\" He walks over and straightens a picture of Geronimo See #Critical reviews. hanging on the back wall, and then exits into the corridor toward the billiard room and the back door.

Three hundred people attended the filming of the finale at Paramount Studios' Stage 25 in Los Angeles on Wednesday, March 31, 1993, from 7:20p.m. to 2:15a.m. The source does not detail the \\"penultimate episode.\\" Because of Shelley Long's commitment to the CBS sitcom Good Advice, the finale's bar scene ending, where the series main cast gather as their own respective characters, was shot without her on Wednesday, April 7, 1993, after the episode \\"It's Lonely on the Top\\" was completely filmed out of sequence on the same day. However, the ending was concealed from the general public and the studio audience until the episode was first broadcast. Before her special guest appearance in this episode, Shelley Long's reprise as Diane Chambers was rumored in 1989 when she appeared with Ted Danson at the premiere of one of his movies, Cousins. A spokesperson for Paramount Television denied these rumors. Long appeared as herself for the 200th episode special in 1990, hosted by John McLaughlin, along with other surviving cast members at the time. The series's creators Glen and Les Charles co-wrote the series finale, and James Burrows directed it. Despite what Les Charles considered the basic story intended to resolve the Sam and Diane story arc, the producers expanded the length of the finale, longer than a typical Cheers episode, to accommodate the network NBC's demands for more commercials. The total number of 30-second commercials that aired on the initial, original broadcast was 25 to 30, each of which cost $650,000..The March 5, 1993, edition of Reading Eagle reported that the budget of each 30-second commercial was estimated $600,000, according to NBC insiders. Later articles report, otherwise, that each was $650,000 estimate. United States President Bill Clinton sent the crew his message saying that he wanted to appear in the finale, so the Charles brothers wrote a segment where Clinton supposedly appeared. However, when the filming of the episode started, Clinton decided to cancel his own appearance. Brandon Tartikoff, former executive of NBC and former chief of Paramount Studios, and Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau appeared in the finale as uncredited bar extras. Bob Broder, agent for the show's creators, also made an uncredited appearance in the final moments of the show as the \\"man\\" who is told by Sam that the bar is closed. =Promotion= The final episode was promoted massively, including in the media, before its initial airing.

Prior to its acquisition by First Citizens BancShares Inc. of Raleigh, First Citizens Bancorporation, Inc. was a bank holding company based in Columbia, South Carolina with over $8 billion in assets. First Citizens Bank of South Carolina had branches in both South Carolina and Georgia. It was the second-largest commercial bank headquartered in South Carolina. History In 1913, the Homestead Bank was founded in Columbia, South Carolina, and later became Commercial Bank and Trust Company of South Carolina. In 1964, the Holding brothers — Frank, Lewis and Robert, who were part owners of First Citizens Bank and Trust of North Carolina - acquired a controlling interest in Anderson Bank of Dillon, South Carolina, which had one location and sixteen employees. Over the years, Anderson Bank grew, changing its name to Citizens Bank of South Carolina in 1968. Commercial Bank and Trust merged with Citizens Bank, becoming First Citizens Bank and Trust Company of South Carolina, headquartered in Columbia. In 1995, First Citizens acquired Summerville National Bank. In 2002, First Citizens entered Georgia by buying Citizens Bank, and added other Georgia operations with First Bank and Trust and The Bank of Toccoa in 2003. In 2005, First Citizens bought Greenville-based Summit Financial Corporation and People's Community Bank in Aiken. On July 23, 2010, First Citizens took over the operations and five branches of Kingstree, South Carolina-based Williamsburg First National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On June 3, 2011, Charleston, South Carolina-based Atlantic Bank & Trust became the first bank to fail in that area since 1992. The three offices reopened June 6 as First Citizens branches. Atlantic Bank had $208 million in assets, $191 million in retail deposits, and three locations—Charleston, Myrtle Beach, and Savannah, Georgia. On July 22, 2011, branches of Exchange Bank of South Carolina, another subsidiary of First Citizens Bancorporation, began converting to First Citizens branches. The change involved four branches in Kingstree and Andrews. On June 10, 2014, it was announced that First Citizens Bank and Trust of Columbia, South Carolina would be acquired by First Citizens Bank of Raleigh. Following shareholder and regulatory approvals, Frank B. Holding Jr., chairman and CEO of Raleigh-based First Citizens BancShares and First Citizens Bank, is expected to lead the combined bank. As of January 1, 2015, First Citizens Bancorporation, Inc. of Columbia, South Carolina merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of First Citizens BancShares, Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina.

There's good rockin' tonight with that new CD coming from Texas. Released on February 1st, 2008, exactly 50 years after the release date of Gene's and his Rebels first single, School of Rock'n'Roll (Jan 11-100), that CD is accurately titled Reminisce Cafe. Produced by Phil York with nice liner notes from DJ Ron Chapman, that CD offers 100% Texas rockin' music shaped with the support of great musicians like Bobby Rambo and Joey D'Ambrosio. It's also interesting to note the presence of Red Callendar, Plas Johnson, Rene Hall and Earl Palmer, all legendary session musicians, who backed Gene on his \\"Jan\\" sessions in 1958. The booklet is a neat one with some vintage 1950s and '60s photos plus two full size record label shots. But a record is at first music so let's talk a little about the first song that gives the title to the CD. Reminisce Cafe is a nice ballad where you will meet Elvis, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and Jerry Lee Lewis. A nice place to be! The next song is She Bops a Lot written by Floyd Dakil of Dance Franny Dance fame. The next three songs are originals from Gene and his wife Dea's pen and cover the whole spectrum of 50's music from ballad to guitar lead rockabilly and sax/vocal chorus movin' rockin' ditty. I Won't Take Any Less carries the shades of Elvis and (It's Love Baby) 24 Hours a Day is a moving cover of the Ted Jarrett song first recorded by Louis Brooks, in 1955. From Gene's own pen, Heartbreak City Limits offers more of a country flavor before Gene takes a stroll on Elvis Presley's repertoire with Love Me Tender. The next track Gonna Drive 'em Up A Wall is a wild, rockin', Little Richard styled song written and performed by Gene and his son Shawn as a duet. The remaining songs are all strong rockers, the last four coming from a 2002 session cut in Sweden and already issued on his album Do Right Daddy. As you listen to this album it seems like 1958 is back again!

The book centers around Cameryn who is the assistant to her coroner father. It was released on May 4, 2006 in the United States. The book was an Edgar Award Nominee in 2007. It is held in over one thousand WorldCat libraries WorldCat Plot summary When Cameryn Mahoney convinces her dad to give her the job of being his assistant, she is thrilled to finally get some hands-on experience in forensics. But Cammie is in for more than she bargained for when the second case that she attends turns out to be her friend and the latest victim of a serial killer, known as the Christopher Killer. And if dealing with that isn't enough, Cammie soon realizes that if she is not careful, she might wind up as the next victim. Characters * Cameryn Mahoney - A seventeen-year-old (high school senior) girl who is the kid of the Silverton coroner. She also goes by the nickname Cammie. Her dream is to follow in her father's footsteps and become a forensic pathologist. Cameryn has studied multiple books on forensics, which her Mammaw disapproves of. After convincing her father to let her be his assistant, she gets an inside look at the world of forensics. Cameryn lives with her crazy Mammaw's in her house, and can not remember ever having seen her mother. Cameryn has a second job at the Grand Hotel. It is implied that she is attracted to Justin Crowley. * Patrick Mahoney - the father of Cameryn Mahoney and the Silverton coroner. At first, he is reluctant to accept Cameryn as the assistant to the coroner. But he soon gives in and is extremely impressed with her observations on their first case together. He highly dislikes Justin, the new deputy. * Justin Crowley - the new deputy of the town who is twenty-one years old. He originally comes from Albany, New York and found his current job of deputy over the Internet. Later on, Cameryn finds out he knew the artist Hannah Peterson, her mother, who she has never set eyes on. Justin met Hannah at a party thrown by his brother and sister-in-law. Hannah gave him a painting and a letter was supposed to be given to Cameryn at the right time. He cares a lot about Cameryn and her safety. * Sheriff Jacobs - Silverton's sheriff. He always emanates disapproval towards Cameryn every time she is at a crime scene. He acknowledges that there is something between Cameryn and Justin. * Dr. Moore - the nearest forensic pathologist to which any victims can be brought. He is very hot-tempered and believes himself to be the 'captain of the ship'. So he doesn't enjoy it when Cameryn states she sees something, which was unseen to him and he implies that she is only an amateur. He enjoys listening to opera music while performing autopsies. * Raymond Jewel - world- renowned psychic. He is the one who first claimed to have seen the spirit of Rachel telling him the details of her whereabouts. His description was proven right when Rachel was found in Silverton. He is commonly known by his last name, Jewel. * Rachel Geller - a fellow server at the Grand, and the unfortunate victim of a serial killer. * Mammaw - Cameryn's paternal Irish grandmother. She disagrees with Cammie on her choice of future profession and tries many times to change her granddaughter's mind to no avail. * Hannah Peterson - the mother of Cameryn. She has never come to visit Cameryn since their separation, due to fear of rejection, although she wishes to. Hannah sought the help of Justin to soften Cameryn up before trying to visit. She is an avid painter, so she sends a painting to Cammie as well as a letter. * Lyric Daphne - Cameryn's best friend since the fifth-grade. She is the exact opposite of Cameryn, so their friendship is an unlikely one. Lyric is very loud, believes in mystics, and wears clothes that are bright and set to her mood. She is very eccentric and gives off a mystical vibe. * Adam Stinson - is the weird kid in Silverton. He wears all black, smokes, and keeps to himself all the time. Adam adores Rachel Geller and has pictures of her in the basement of his job for their school yearbook . At one point he is suspected to have killed Rachel due to his possession of pictures of her.

Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) was an Enterprise architecture framework for treasury, based on the Zachman Framework. It was developed by the US Department of the Treasury and published in July 2000.US Department of the Treasury Chief Information Officer Council (2000). Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework . Version 1, July 2000.

Accessed January 10, 2013 The material presented here is obsolete and only useful for historical reference and is not the current policy in use by the Department of the Treasury.  Overview  The Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) an architectural framework that supports Treasury's business processes in terms of products. This framework guides the development and redesign of the business processes for various bureaus in order to meet the requirements of recent legislation in a rapidly changing technology environment. The TEAF prescribes architectural views and delineates a set of notional products to portray these views. TEAF view model. The TEAF describes provides: * Guidance to Treasury bureaus concerning the development and evolution of information systems architecture, * A unifying concept, common principles, technologies, and standards for information systems, and * A template for the development of the Enterprise Architecture. The TEAF's functional, information and organizational architecture views collectively model the organizations processes, procedures, and business operations. By grounding the architecture in the business of the organization, the TEAF defines the core business procedures and enterprise processes. Through its explicit models, a TEAF-based architecture enables the identification and reasoning of enterprise- and system-level concerns and investment decisions.  History  The Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) is derived from earlier treasury models, such as the US Treasury model (TISAF) released 1997, and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), released in 1999.Jaap Schekkerman (2003). How to Survive in the Jungle of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks. p.113 The first version of the TEAF was released July 2000. Blueprint Roadmap to Treasury IT Modernization.Standards and Configuration Management Team (SCMT) of the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Sub-Council (TEAC) (2007). Treasury Technical Standards Profile . May 2007 In the new millennium the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) has developed into the Treasury Enterprise Architecture (TEA), which aims to establish a roadmap for the modernization and optimization of the U.S. Treasury Department's business processes and IT environment. The Treasury Enterprise Architecture will provide a framework to guide IT investment planning, streamline systems, and ensure that IT programs align with business requirements and strategic goals.E-Government U.S. Treasury Department, accessed 09 Dec 2008.  TEAF Topics  = Enterprise Architecture = EA Development Environment. Effective management and strategic decision making, especially for information technology (IT) investments, require an integrated view of the enterprise—understanding the interrelationships among the business organizations, their operational processes, and the information systems that support them. An Enterprise Architecture formalizes the identification, documentation, and management of these interrelationships, and supports the management and decision processes. The Enterprise Architecture provides substantial support for evolution of an enterprise as it anticipates and responds to the changing needs of its customers and constituents. The Enterprise Architecture is a vital part of the enterprise's decision-making process, and will evolve along with the enterprise's mission. The TEAF has been designed to help both the bureaus and the Department develop and maintain their Enterprise Architectures. The TEAF aims to establish a common Enterprise Architecture structure, consistent practices, and common terminology; and to institutionalize Enterprise Architecture governance across the Department. This architectural consistency will facilitate integration, information sharing, and exploitation of common requirements across Treasury. = Enterprise Architecture Framework = Overview of a Framework for EA Direction, Description, and Accomplishment Overview. The purpose of the Enterprise Architecture Framework is to provide a structure for producing an Enterprise Architecture (EA) and managing Enterprise Architecture assets. To reduce the complexity and scope of developing and using an Enterprise Architecture, it must be subdivided so that portions may be used independently or built incrementally in separate projects. The TEAF subdivides an Enterprise Architecture by: * Views * Perspectives * Work products The TEAF identifies, as shown in the figure, resources and work products that provide direction for EA development, work products constituting the EA description, and work products documenting how to accomplishment an EA implementation. The resources and work products for EA direction and accomplishment are not part of the EA description itself, but are developed and applied during the overall enterprise life cycle. The TEAF Matri, organizes the subdivisions of the EA description and demonstrates the relationships among them. The following sections describe the subdivisions of the EA and their relationships to the TEAF Matrix. = TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives = TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives. The TEAF Matrix is a simplified portrayal of an EA structure to aid in understanding important EA aspects from various vantage points (views and perspectives). The TEAF Matrix aims to provide a simple, uniform structure to an entire framework. As depicted in the figure, the TEAF Matrix consists of four architectural views (Functional, Information, Organizational, and Infrastructure), which are shown as columns, and four perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, and Builder), which appear as rows. The TEAF Matrix is a four-by-four matrix with a total of 16 cells. The views and perspectives are described in the following sections. When an EA description work product is shown within one cell of the TEAF Matrix, it means that the main vantage points for developing that work product correspond to that column (view) and row (perspective). However, information from other views (and sometimes other perspectives) is needed to produce a work product. Not all cells must be \\"filled-in\\" by producing an associated work product. Each bureau must define in its EA Roadmap its plans for producing and using an EA to match its needs. = Enterprise Life Cycle activities = thumb320pxleftTEAF Enterprise Life Cycle activities An Enterprise Life Cycle integrates the management, business, and engineering life cycle processes that span the enterprise to align its business and IT activities. Enterprise Life Cycle refers generally to an organization's approach for managing activities and making decisions during ongoing refreshment of business and technical practices to support its enterprise mission. These activities include investment management, project definition, configuration management, accountability, and guidance for systems development according to a System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The Enterprise Life Cycle applies to enterprise-wide planning activities and decision making. By contrast, a System Development Life Cycle generally refers to practices for building individual systems. Determining what systems to build is an enterprise-level decision. The figure on the left depicts notional activities of an Enterprise Life Cycle methodology. Within the context of this document, Enterprise Life Cycle does not refer to a specific methodology or a specific bureau's approach. Each organization needs to follow a documented Enterprise Life Cycle methodology appropriate to its size, the complexity of its enterprise, and the scope of its needs. = Products = TEAF Products. The TEAF provides a unifying concept, common terminology and principles, common standards and formats, a normalized context for strategic planning and budget formulation, and a universal approach for resolving policy and management issues. It describes the enterprise information systems architecture and its components, including the architectures purpose, benefits, characteristics, and structure. The TEAF introduces various architectural views and delineates several modeling techniques. Each view is supported with graphics, data repositories, matrices, or reports (i.e., architectural products). The figure shows a matrix with four views and four perspectives. Essential products are shown across the top two rows of the matrix. It is notable that the TEAF includes an Information Assurance Trust model, the Technical Reference Model, and standards profiles as essential work products. These are not often addressed as critical framework components. One of these frameworks should provide a means to logically structure and organize the selected EA products. Now, in order to effectively create and maintain the EA products, a toolset should be selected. = System Interface Description = System Interface Description, Levels 1, 2, 3, 4—Generic Examples. The System Interface Description (SID) links together the Organizational and Infrastructure Views by depicting the assignments of systems and their interfaces to the nodes and needlines described in the Node Connectivity Description. The Node Connectivity Description for a given architecture shows nodes (not always defined in physical terms), while the System Interface Description depicts the systems corresponding to the system nodes. The System Interface Description can be produced at four levels, as described below. Level 1 is an essential work product, while Levels 2, 3, and 4 are supporting work products. The System Interface Description identifies the interfaces between nodes, between systems, and between the components of a system, depending on the needs of a particular architecture. A system interface is a simplified or generalized representation of a communications pathway or network, usually depicted graphically as a straight line, with a descriptive label. Often, pairs of connected systems or system components have multiple interfaces between them. The System Interface Description depicts all interfaces between systems and/or system components that are of interest to the architect. The graphic descriptions and/or supporting text for the System Interface Description should provide details concerning the capabilities of each system. For example, descriptions of information systems should include details concerning the applications present within the system, the infrastructure services that support the applications, and the means by which the system processes, manipulates, stores, and exchanges data.
